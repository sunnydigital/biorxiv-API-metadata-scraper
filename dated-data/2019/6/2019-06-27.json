    "abstract": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA), an important source of dopamine, regulates goal- and reward-directed and social behaviors, wakefulness and sleep. Hyperactivation of dopamine neurons generates behavioral pathologies. But any roles of non-dopamine VTA neurons in psychiatric illness have been little explored. Lesioning or chemogenetically inhibiting VTA GABAergic (VTAVgat) neurons generated persistent wakefulness with mania-like qualities: locomotor activity was increased; sensitivity to D-amphetamine was heightened; immobility times decreased on the tail suspension and forced swim tests; and sucrose preference increased. Furthermore, after sleep deprivation, mice with lesioned VTAVgat neurons did not catch up on the lost NREM sleep, even though they were starting from an already highly sleep-deprived baseline, suggesting that the sleep homeostasis process was bypassed. The mania-like behaviors, including the sleep loss, were reversed by the mood-stabilizing drug valproate, and re-emerged when valproate treatment was stopped. Lithium salts, however, had no effect. The mania like-behaviors partially depended on dopamine, because giving D1/D2/D3 receptor antagonists partially restored the behaviors, but also on VTAVgat projections to the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Optically or chemogenetically inhibiting VTAVgat terminals in the LH elevated locomotion and decreased immobility time during the tail suspension and forced swimming tests. VTAVgat neurons are centrally positioned to help set an animals (and humans) level of mental and physical activity. Inputs that inhibit VTAVgat neurons intensify wakefulness (increased activity, enhanced alertness and motivation), qualities useful for acute survival. Taken to the extreme, however, decreased or failed inhibition from VTAVgat neurons produces mania-like qualities (hyperactivity, hedonia, decreased sleep).",

    "abstract": "Down Syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental outcomes. At present, the relationship between structural brain morphology and the spectrum of cognitive phenotypes in DS, is not well understood. This study aimed to quantify development of the fetal and neonatal brain in DS using dedicated, optimised and motion-corrected in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We detected deviations in development and altered regional brain growth in the fetus with DS from 21 weeks gestation, when compared to age-matched controls. Reduced cerebellar volume was apparent in the second trimester with significant alteration in cortical growth becoming evident during the third trimester. Developmental abnormalities in the cortex and cerebellum are likely substrates for later neurocognitive impairment, and ongoing studies will allow us to confirm the role of antenatal MRI as an early biomarker for subsequent cognitive ability in DS. In the era of rapidly developing technologies, it is hoped that the results of this study will assist counselling for prospective parents.",

    "abstract": "Wallerian degeneration of physically injured axons involves a well-defined molecular pathway linking loss of axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to activation of pro-degenerative protein SARM1. Manipulating the pathway through these proteins led to the identification of non-axotomy insults causing axon degeneration by a Wallerian-like mechanism, including several involving mitochondrial impairment. Mitochondrial dysfunction is heavily implicated in Parkinsons disease, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia and other axonal disorders. However, whether and how mitochondrial impairment activates Wallerian degeneration has remained unclear. Here, we show that disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential leads to axonal NMNAT2 depletion in mouse sympathetic neurons, increasing the substrate-to-product ratio (NMN/NAD) of this NAD-synthesising enzyme, a metabolic fingerprint of Wallerian degeneration. The mechanism appears to involve both impaired NMNAT2 synthesis and reduced axonal transport. Expression of WLDS and Sarm1 deletion both protect axons after mitochondrial uncoupling. Blocking the pathway also confers neuroprotection and increases the lifespan of flies with Pink1 loss-of-function mutation, which causes severe mitochondrial defects. These data indicate that mitochondrial impairment replicates all the major steps of Wallerian degeneration, placing it upstream of NMNAT2 loss, with the potential to contribute to axon pathology in mitochondrial disorders.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is involved in control of voluntary and autonomic rhythmic behaviors, yet it is largely unclear to what extent it coordinates these in a concerted action. Here, we studied Purkinje cell activity during unperturbed and perturbed respiration in cerebellar lobules simplex, crus 1 and 2. During unperturbed (eupneic) respiration complex spike and simple spike activity encoded respiratory activity, the timing of which corresponded with ongoing sensorimotor feedback. Instead, upon whisker stimulation mice concomitantly accelerated their simple spike activity and inspiration in a phase-dependent manner. Moreover, the accelerating impact of whisker stimulation on respiration could be mimicked by optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells and prevented by cell-specific genetic modification of their AMPA receptors that hampered increases in simple spike firing. Thus, the impact of Purkinje cell activity on respiratory control is context- and phase-dependent, suggesting a coordinating role for the cerebellar hemispheres in aligning autonomic and sensorimotor behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) plays a useful role in the treatment of many diseases. In previous designs, it is only desired to maximize the absolute value of the electric field in the target zone. Whereas due to the nerve cable equation (NCE), the membrane potential of a nerve cell is changed due to the rate of change in the tangential electric field [Formula]. In this paper, the criterion of the design is to maximize [Formula] along the nerve cell fiber and simultaneously minimize the absolute value of the electric field. The direction of the nerve fibers is obtained using Tractography. Then, the specifications of source and coils such as position and spatial angles are determined in such a way that every two coils cancel the absolute value of the electric field of each other by using reciprocity theorem. This happened whereas the [Formula] is maximized. For better comparison, a 20-coil array is designed for stimulation of cingulum region of the brain. Results of this array are compared with results of the FO8-Halo coil and it is shown that with the same value for [Formula], an absolute value of the induced field in the brain for the 20-coil array is much smaller than the FO8-Halo coil. Also, designed coil array requires smaller sources. So, the array can stimulate the target zone more accurately and with higher efficiency. This new technique can solve the problem of stimulation of the large areas of the brain and stimulate the desired target zone with more accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of Aurora-B kinase is a synthetic lethal therapy for tumors that overexpress the MYC oncoprotein. It is currently unclear whether co-occurring oncogenic alterations might influence this synthetic lethality by confering more or less potency in the killing of tumor cells. To identify such modifers, we utilized isogenic cell lines to test a variety of cancer genes that have been previously demonstrated to promote survival under conditions of cellular stress, contribute to chemoresistance and/or suppress MYC-primed apoposis. We found that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, two antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, can partially suppress the synthetic lethality, but not multinucleation, elicited by a panaurora kinase inhibitor, VX-680. We demonstrate that this suppression stems from the rescue of autophagic cell death, specifically of multinucleated cells, rather than a general inhibition of apoptosis. Bcl-2 inhibits VX-680-induced death of polyploid cells by interacting with the autophagy protein Beclin1/Atg6 and rescue requires localization of Bcl-2 to the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings expand on previous conclusions that autophagic death of polyploid cells is mediated by Atg6. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL negatively modulate MYC-VX-680 synthetic lethality and it is the anti-autophagic activity of these two Bcl-2 family proteins, specifically in multinucleate cells, that contributes to resistance to Aurora kinase-targeting drugs.",

    "abstract": "Protozoan parasites Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba invadens formed a polarized phenotype, an elongated shape with a single leading edge and a trailing edge when treated with pentoxifylline. The leading edge of the polarized morphology was a spherical protrusion devoid of F-actin but with occasional F-actin scars, indicating the presence of bleb. The polarized form was stable bleb driven since the blebbing was limited to the leading edge. Pentoxifylline induced chemokinesis in Entamoeba as it switched the motility pattern from slow and random to fast and directionally persistent. Pentoxifylline speeded up the cell aggregation in E. invadens during growth and encystation due to enhanced chemotaxis of the polarized form. The transformation of non-polarized adherent trophozoites to nonadherent stable bleb driven form occurred via lamellipodial and bleb driven adherent intermediate phenotypes. The nonadherent polarized phenotype was highly motile under confinement and moved by rearward plasma membrane flow. In contrast to pentoxifylline, adenosine, the adenosine receptor agonist, stimulated the formation of multiple protrusions leading to random motility. Thus pentoxifylline might prevent lateral protrusions by inhibiting adenosine receptor, producing the monopodial polarized morphology.\\n\\nSummary statementPentoxifylline, the adenosine receptor antagonist induced a stable bleb driven polarized morphology in Entamoeba characterized by fast, directionally persistent and highly chemotactic motility.",

We isolated OROV via cell culture and developed an algorithmically-designed primer set for whole-genome amplification of the virus. Metagenomic sequencing of the patient samples provided OROV genome coverage ranging from 68 - 99%. The additional cases formed a single phylogenetic cluster together with the initial case.

    "abstract": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease, caused by Apicomplexan parasites of the Plasmodium genus. The Anopheles mosquito is necessary for the sexual replication of these parasites and for their transmission to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Imaging of the parasite within the insect vector has been attempted using multiple microscopy methods, most of which are hampered by the presence of the light scattering opaque cuticle of the mosquito. So far, imaging of the Plasmodium mosquito stages depended on either sectioning or surgical dissection of important anatomical sites, such as the midgut and the salivary glands. Optical projection tomography (OPT) and light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) enable imaging fields of view in the centimeter scale whilst providing micrometer resolution. In this paper, we present reconstructions of the whole body of Plasmodium-infected, optically cleared Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes and their midguts. The 3D-reconstructions from OPT imaging show detailed features of the mosquito anatomy and enable overall localization of parasites in midguts. Additionally, LSFM imaging of mosquito midguts shows detailed distribution of oocysts in extracted midguts.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in macaque frontal eye field contribute to spatial but typically not feature selection during visual search. Using an innovative visual search task, we report a serendipitous discovery that some frontal eye field neurons can develop rapid selectivity for stimulus orientation that is used to guide gaze during a visual search task with pro-saccade and anti-saccade responses. This feature selectivity occurs simultaneously at multiple locations for all objects sharing that feature and coincides with when neurons select the singleton of a search array. This feature selectivity also reveals the distinct, subsequent operation of selecting the endpoint of the saccade in pro-saccade as well as anti-saccade trials. These results demonstrate that target selection preceding saccade preparation is composed of multiple operations. We conjecture that singleton selection indexes the allocation of attention, which can be divided, to conspicuous items. Consequently, endpoint selection indexes the focused allocation of attention to the endpoint of the saccade. These results demonstrate that saccade target selection is not a unitary process.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFrontal eye field is well known to contribute to spatial selection for attention and eye movements.

It is characterized by bone marrow lymphoid precursors that acquire genetic alterations, resulting in disrupted maturation and uncontrollable proliferation. More than a dozen molecular subtypes of variable severity can be used to classify cALL cases. Modern therapy protocols currently cure 85-90% of cases, but other patients are refractory or will relapse and eventually succumb to their disease. To better understand these difficult cases, we investigated the nature and extent of intra-individual transcriptional heterogeneity of cALL at the cellular level by sequencing the transcriptomes of 39,375 individual cells in eight patients (six pre-B and two pre-T) and three healthy pediatric controls. We observed intra-individual transcriptional clusters in five out of the eight patients. Using pseudotime maturation trajectories of healthy B and T cells, we obtained the predicted developmental state of each leukemia cell and observed distribution shifts within patients. We showed that the predicted developmental states of these cancer cells are inversely correlated with ribosomal protein expression levels, which could be a common contributor to intra-individual heterogeneity in cALL patients.",

    "abstract": "The nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) in motile cilia and flagella functions as a linker between neighboring doublet microtubules, acts to stabilize the axonemal core structure, and serves as a central hub for the regulation of ciliary motility. Although the N-DRC has been studied extensively using genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches, the precise arrangement of the eleven (or more) N-DRC subunits remains unknown. Here, using cryo-electron tomography, we have compared the structure of Chlamydomonas wild-type flagella to that of strains with specific DRC subunit deletions or rescued strains with tagged DRC subunits. Our results show that DRC7 is a central linker subunit that helps connect the N-DRC to the outer dynein arms. DRC11 is required for the assembly of DRC8, and DRC8/11 form a sub-complex in the proximal lobe of the linker domain that is required to form stable contacts to the neighboring B-tubule. Gold labeling of tagged subunits determines the precise locations of the previously ambiguous N-terminus of DRC4 which is now shown to contribute to the core scaffold of the N-DRC and C-terminus of DRC5. Our results reveal the overall architecture of N-DRC, with the three subunits, DRC1/2/4 forming a core complex that serves as the scaffold for the assembly of the \\\"functional subunits\\\" associate, namely DRC3/5-8/11. These findings shed light on N-DRC assembly and its role in regulating flagellar beating.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCilia and flagella are small hair-like appendages in eukaryotic cells that play essential roles in cell sensing, signaling, and motility. The highly conserved nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) is one of the key regulators for ciliary motility. At least 11 proteins (DRC1-11) have been assigned to the N-DRC, but their precise arrangement within the large N-DRC structure is not yet known. Here, using cryo-electron tomography combined with genetic approaches, we have localized DRC7, the sub-complex DRC8/DRC11, the N-terminus of DRC4, and the C-terminus of DRC5. Our results provide insights into the N-DRC structure, its function in the regulation of dynein activity, and the mechanism by which n-drc mutations can lead to defects in ciliary motility that cause disease.",

The microsphere cytometry allows multiparametric single cell quantification of signaling pathway activity and lineage-specific marker expression in cells adhered to surface-functionalized microspheres that mimic specific microenvironments. Using this approach, we analyzed age-dependent changes in human mammary myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells exposed to different ECM and growth factors. We found that ECM-mediated MAP kinase and PI3 kinase activation levels in HMEC were attenuated with age. Older luminal cells displayed higher surface integrin levels consistent with acquired basal identity, albeit with decreased integrin activation and increased Src-signaling relative to myoepithelial cells. We show that the diminished signaling magnitude in HMEC from older women correlated with reduced probability of activating oncogene-induced senescence. We propose that age-related changes in ECM-mediated epithelial cell regulation may impair protective tumor suppression mechanisms and increase breast cancer susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Deficiency of the LIS1 protein causes lissencephaly, a brain developmental disorder. Although LIS1 binds the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein and has been linked to dynein function in many experimental systems, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we revealed the function of LIS1 in cargo-adapter-mediated dynein activation in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans. Specifically, we found that overexpressed cargo adapter HookA (Hook in A. nidulans) missing its cargo-binding domain ({Delta}C-HookA) causes dynein and its regulator dynactin to relocate from the microtubule plus ends to the minus ends, and this dramatic relocation requires LIS1 and its binding protein NudE. Astonishingly, the requirement for LIS1 or NudE can be bypassed to a significant extent by specific mutations that open the auto-inhibited \\\"phi-dynein\\\" in which the motor domains of the dynein dimer are held close together. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of LIS1 action: it promotes the switch of dynein from the auto-inhibited state to an open state to facilitate dynein activation.\\n\\nSummaryThis study reveals the role of Lissencephaly 1 (LIS1) in cargo-adapter-mediated dynein activation. Furthermore, it discovers a novel mechanism of LIS1 action involving a switch of dynein from an auto-inhibited state to an active state.",

    "abstract": "The human brain has changed dramatically since humans diverged from our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and the other great apes1-5. However, the genetic and developmental programs underlying this divergence are not fully understood6-8. Here, we have analyzed stem cell-derived cerebral organoids using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) and accessible chromatin profiling (scATAC-seq) to explore gene regulatory changes that are specific to humans. We first analyze cell composition and reconstruct differentiation trajectories over the entire course of human cerebral organoid development from pluripotency, through neuroectoderm and neuroepithelial stages, followed by divergence into neuronal fates within the dorsal and ventral forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain regions. We find that brain region composition varies in organoids from different iPSC lines, yet regional gene expression patterns are largely reproducible across individuals. We then analyze chimpanzee and macaque cerebral organoids and find that human neuronal development proceeds at a delayed pace relative to the other two primates. Through pseudotemporal alignment of differentiation paths, we identify human-specific gene expression resolved to distinct cell states along progenitor to neuron lineages in the cortex. We find that chromatin accessibility is dynamic during cortex development, and identify instances of accessibility divergence between human and chimpanzee that correlate with human-specific gene expression and genetic change. Finally, we map human-specific expression in adult prefrontal cortex using single-nucleus RNA-seq and find developmental differences that persist into adulthood, as well as cell state-specific changes that occur exclusively in the adult brain. Our data provide a temporal cell atlas of great ape forebrain development, and illuminate dynamic gene regulatory features that are unique to humans.",

    "abstract": "The segregation of cells with distinct regional identity underlies formation of a sharp border, which in some tissues serves to organise a boundary signaling centre. It is unclear whether or how border sharpness is coordinated with induction of boundary-specific gene expression. We show that forward signaling of EphA4 is required for border sharpening and induction of boundary cells in the zebrafish hindbrain, which we find both require kinase-dependent signaling, with a lesser input of PDZ domain-dependent signaling. We find that boundary-specific gene expression is regulated by myosin II phosphorylation, which increases actomyosin contraction downstream of EphA4 signaling. Myosin phosphorylation leads to nuclear translocation of Taz, which together with Tead1a is required for boundary marker expression. Since actomyosin contraction maintains sharp borders, there is direct coupling of border sharpness to boundary cell induction that ensures correct organisation of signaling centres.",

A longstanding prediction of life history theory states that these parasites can harm the reproductive individual, reducing its subsequent fitness and producing reproduction-fitness tradeoffs. Here, we examined associations among reproductive allocation, immunity, parasitism, and subsequent fitness in a wild population of individually identified red deer (Cervus elaphus). Using path analysis, we investigated whether costs of lactation for downstream survival and fecundity were mediated by changes in strongyle nematode count and mucosal antibody levels. Lactating females exhibited increased parasite counts, which were in turn associated with substantially decreased fitness in the following year in terms of overwinter survival, fecundity, subsequent calf weight, and parturition date. This study offers observational evidence for parasite regulation of multiple life history tradeoffs, supporting the role of parasites as an important mediating factor in wild mammal populations.",

Data from two-stage decision tasks have seemingly shown that human behaviour is driven by both processes operating in parallel. However, in this study, we show that more detailed task instructions lead participants to make primarily model-based choices that have little, if any, simple model-free influence. We also demonstrate that behaviour in the two-stage task may falsely appear to be driven by a combination of simple model-free and model-based learning if purely model-based agents form inaccurate models of the task because of misconceptions. Furthermore, we report evidence that many participants do misconceive the task in important ways. Overall, we argue that humans formulate a wide variety of learning models. Consequently, the simple dichotomy of model-free versus model-based learning is inadequate to explain behaviour in the two-stage task and connections between reward learning, habit formation, and compulsivity.",

Yet, little is known about how brain regions involved in cognition and emotion might contribute to overeating, and therefore, obesity. We used a recently developed behavioral task in which learned contextual cues induce feeding even in sated mice to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms. Using viral tracing, molecular profiling and chemo/optogenetic techniques, we discovered that an insular cortex projection to the central amygdala is required for conditioned overconsumption but not homeostatic feeding. The projection neurons express nitric oxide synthase-1 and activation of this population suppresses satiety signals in the central amygdala. The data thus indicate that the insular cortex provides top down control of homeostatic circuits to promote overconsumption in response to learned cues.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryNitric oxide synthase-1 neurons in the insular cortex promote overconsumption by projecting to the central amygdala to suppress a homeostatic satiety signal.",

Dynamic 2D protocols with acquisition times of one minute or less were achieved through radial undersampling or a Cartesian parallel imaging approach.

Radial trajectories had considerable advantages over a Cartesian approach, including a factor of two improvement in the measured SNR (p<0.00001, N=6), improved distal vessel delineation and the lack of a need for calibration data. The 3D radial approach produced good quality angiograms with negligible artifacts despite the high acceleration factor (R=13).\\n\\nConclusionRadial trajectories outperform conventional Cartesian techniques for accelerated vessel-selective ASL dynamic angiography.",

Here we describe a novel population of stress-responsive neurons in the lateral septum (LS) of mice that express neurotensin (LSNTS) in a sexually dimorphic, estrous cycle-dependent manner. We used in vivo imaging to show that LSNTS neurons are activated by stressful experiences when flight is a viable option, but not by a stressful experience associated with freezing or immobility. LSNTS activation leads to a decrease of food intake and body weight in mice, without altering locomotion or other behaviors associated with anxiety. Molecular profiling of LSNTS neurons showed that these neurons co-express Glp1r (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor), and both pharmacologic and genetic manipulations of Glp1r signaling in the LS recapitulates the behavioral effects of LSNTS activation. Finally, we mapped the outputs of LSNTS neurons and show that activation of LSNTS nerve terminals in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), a well-established feeding center, also decrease food intake. Taken together, these results show that LSNTS neurons link stress and anorexia via effects on hypothalamic pathways regulating food intake.",

    "abstract": "Information about motion is encoded by direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs). These cells reliably transmit this information across a broad range of light levels, spanning moonlight to sunlight. Previous work indicates that adaptation to low light levels causes heterogeneous changes to the direction tuning of ON-OFF (oo)DSGCs and suggests that superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs (s-DSGCs) are biased toward detecting stimuli rather than precisely signaling direction. Using a large-scale multi-electrode array, we measured the absolute sensitivity of ooDSGCs and found that s-DSGCs are ten-fold more sensitive to dim flashes of light than other ooDSGCs. We measured their receptive field sizes and found that s-DSGCs also have larger receptive fields than other ooDSGCs, however, the size difference does not fully explain the sensitivity difference. Using a conditional knockout of gap junctions and pharmacological manipulations, we demonstrate that GABA-mediated inhibition contributes to the difference in absolute sensitivity and receptive field size at low light levels, while the connexin36-mediated gap junction coupling plays a minor role. We further show that GABA-mediated inhibition masks the OFF response of ooDSGCs under scotopic conditions, restricting their responses to increases in light. These results reveal that GABAergic inhibition controls and differentially modulates the responses of ooDSGCs under scotopic conditions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLight adaptation and parallel processing are two major functions of retina. Here we show that parallel processing is differentially regulated between photopic and scotopic conditions across DSGCs. This differential adaptation alters the absolute sensitivity and RF size of s-DSGCs relative to other ooDSGC types. These results point to novel mechanisms and possibly new circuit elements that shape retinal processing of motion under rod-mediated light levels.",

However, boldness was positively correlated with the time spent near the individual conspecific but not with the individual alien invasive heterospecific tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). Although juvenile Deccan mahseer exhibited significant variation in the preference towards conspecific over heterospecific, no divergence in the utilization of right or left eye was seen while observing these individuals suggesting the lack of lateralized utilization of the brain hemispheres.

The pathological drivers for ccRCC are still poorly understood. One of them is the Ras family of small GTPases that function as \\\"molecular switches\\\" in many diseases including ccRCC. Among them, Di-Ras2 encodes a 26-kDa GTPase that shares 60% homology to Ras and Rap. Yet little is known about the biological function(s) of Di-Ras2. In this study, we found that Di-Ras2 was upregulated in ccRCC, and promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of human ccRCC cells in the absence of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL). Mechanistically, Di-Ras2 induces and regulates ccRCC formation by modulating phosphorylation of the downstream effectors and activating the MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, Di-Ras2 interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase, VHL, which facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of Di-Ras2. Together, these results indicate a potential function of Di-Ras2 as an oncogene and biomarker in ccRCC, and these data provide a new perspective of the relationship between VHL and the MAPK pathway in ccRCC tumorigenesis.",

Despite the fact that a majority of CRPC patients (approximately 70%) harbor a constitutively active PI3K survival pathway, targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway has failed to increase overall survival in clinical trials. Here, we identified two separate and independent survival pathways induced by the bone tumor microenvironment that are hyperactivated in CRPC and confer resistance to PI3K inhibitors. The first pathway involves integrin 6{beta}1-mediated adhesion to laminin and the second involves hypoxia-induced expression of PIM kinases. In vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that these pathways transduce parallel but independent signals that promote survival by reducing oxidative stress and preventing cell death. We further demonstrate that both pathways drive resistance to PI3K inhibitors in PTEN-negative tumors. These results provide preclinical evidence that combined inhibition of integrin 6{beta}1 and PIM kinase in CRPC is required to overcome tumor microenvironment-mediated resistance to PI3K inhibitors in PTEN-negative tumors within the hypoxic and laminin-rich bone microenvironment.",

Here we explore how the urban landscape of Arequipa affects the movement patterns of free-roaming dogs, the main reservoirs of the rabies virus in the area. We tracked 23 free-roaming dogs using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. We analyzed the spatio-temporal GPS data using the time- local convex hull method. Dog movement patterns varied across local environments. We found that water channels, an urban feature of Arequipa that are dry most of the year, promote movement. Dogs that used the water channels move further, faster and more directionally than dogs that do not. Our findings suggest that water channels can be used by dogs as  highways to transverse the city and have the potential to spread disease far beyond the radius of control practices. Control efforts should focus on a robust vaccination campaign attuned to the geography of the city, and not limited to small-scale rings surrounding cases.",

    "abstract": "The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis posits that early childhood stressors disproportionately impact adult health. Numerous studies have found adult mental health to be associated with childhood adversities and genetic variants, particularly in genes related to neurochemistry. However, few studies have examined the way interactive effects may manifest over time and fewer still include protective factors, like resilience. Our group has previously found associations between the monoamine oxidase A gene, MAOA, and a contextually-specific measure of resilience with a measure of perceived psychosocial stress over time in Syrian refugee youth. In this study, we work with the same sample of adolescents to test genetic variants in three additional candidate genes (FAAH, the 5-HTTLPR region of SLC6A4, and BDNF) for associations with six psychosocial stress and mental health outcomes. Using multi-level modeling, we find no association between variants in these candidate genes and psychosocial stress or mental health outcomes. Our analysis included tests for both direct genetic effects and interactions with lifetime trauma and resilience. Negative results, such as the lack of genetic associations with outcome measures, provides a more complete framework in which to better understand positive results and associations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlasmodium falciparum (Pf) whole-organism sporozoite vaccines have provided excellent protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) and naturally transmitted heterogeneous Pf in the field. Initial CHMI studies showed significantly higher durable protection against homologous than heterologous strains, suggesting the presence of strain-specific vaccine-induced protection. However, interpretation of these results and understanding of their relevance to vaccine efficacy (VE) have been hampered by the lack of knowledge on genetic differences between vaccine and CHMI strains, and how these strains are related to parasites in malaria endemic regions.\\n\\nMethodsWhole genome sequencing using long-read (Pacific Biosciences) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing platforms was conducted to generate de novo genome assemblies for the vaccine strain, NF54, and for strains used in heterologous CHMI (7G8 from Brazil, NF166.C8 from Guinea, and NF135.C10 from Cambodia). The assemblies were used to characterize sequence polymorphisms and structural variants in each strain relative to the reference Pf 3D7 (a clone of NF54) genome. Strains were compared to each other and to clinical isolates from South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia.\\n\\nResultsWhile few variants were detected between 3D7 and NF54, we identified tens of thousands of variants between NF54 and the three heterologous strains both genome-wide and within regulatory and immunologically important regions, including in pre-erythrocytic antigens that may be key for sporozoite vaccine-induced protection. Additionally, these variants directly contribute to diversity in immunologically important regions of the genomes as detected through in silico CD8+ T cell epitope predictions. Of all heterologous strains, NF135.C10 consistently had the highest number of unique predicted epitope sequences when compared to NF54, while NF166.C8 had the lowest. Comparison to global clinical isolates revealed that these four strains are representative of their geographic region of origin despite long-term culture adaptation; of note, NF135.C10 is from an admixed population, and not part of recently-formed drug resistant subpopulations present in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results are assisting the interpretation of VE of whole-organism vaccines against homologous and heterologous CHMI, and may be useful in informing the choice of strains for inclusion in region-specific or multi-strain vaccines.",

To address these questions, we combined functional MRI with an interaction-based minimal group paradigm in which participants either directly caused harm to victims (i.e., personal guilt), or observed in-group members cause harm to the victims (i.e., group-based guilt). In three experiments (N = 90), we demonstrated that perceived shared responsibility with in-group members in the transgression predicted behavioral and neural manifestations of group-based guilt. Multivariate pattern analysis of the functional MRI data showed that group-based guilt recruited a similar brain representation in anterior middle cingulate cortex as personal guilt.

As an example of such computations, a forward model compensates for a sensory ambiguity where the peripheral otolith organs in the inner ear sense both head tilts and translations. Here we exploit the response dynamics of two functionally-coupled Purkinje cell types in the caudal vermis to understand their role in this computation. We find that one population encodes tilt velocity, whereas the other, translation-selective, population encodes linear acceleration. Using a dynamical model, we further show that these signals likely represent sensory prediction error for the on-line updating of tilt and translation estimates. These properties also reveal the need for temporal integration between the tilt-selective velocity and translation-selective acceleration population signals. We show that a simple model incorporating a biologically plausible short time constant can mediate the required temporal integration.",

We investigated the neural reflections of behavioral automation as participants mastered a dual n-back task. In four fMRI scans equally spanning a 6-week training period, we assessed brain network modularity, a substrate for adaptation in biological systems. We found that whole-brain modularity steadily increased during training for both conditions of the dual n-back task. In a dynamic analysis, we found that the autonomy of the default mode system and integration among task-positive systems were modulated by training. The automation of the n-back task through training resulted in non-linear changes in integration between the fronto-parietal and default mode systems, and integration with the subcortical system. Our findings suggest that the automation of a cognitively demanding task may result in more segregated network organization.",

Here we reveal novel functions of complement pathways impacting on emotional reactivity of potential relevance to the emerging links between complement and risk for psychiatric disorder. We used mouse models to assess the effects of manipulating components of the complement system on emotionality. Mice lacking the complement C3a Receptor (C3aR-/-) demonstrated a selective increase in unconditioned (innate) anxiety whilst mice deficient in the central complement component C3 (C3-/-) showed a selective increase in conditioned (learned) fear. The dissociable behavioural phenotypes were linked to different signalling mechanisms. Effects on innate anxiety were independent of C3a, the canonical ligand for C3aR, consistent with the existence of an alternative ligand mediating innate anxiety, whereas effects on learned fear were due to loss of iC3b/CR3 signalling. Our findings show that specific elements of the complement system and associated signalling pathways contribute differentially to heightened states of anxiety and fear commonly seen in psychopathology.",

However, vasculogenesis can result in large diameter blood vessels, raising the question how these vessels are formed. Here, we describe an alternative model of vasculogenesis that results in the formation of large diameter vessels. In this model, ECs coalesce into a branched network of EC struts within the future lumen of the vessel. These struts maintain the patency of the vessel and serve as a scaffold for the ECs forming the vessel wall, which initially consists out of a few patches of ECs. Together, we show that endothelial struts facilitate the formation of large blood vessels without being bound by the prerequisite of a cord-like structure, nor are they restricted in size.",

    "abstract": "Multipotent adult stem cells must balance self-renewal with differentiation into various mature cell types. How this activity is molecularly regulated is poorly understood. By using genetic and molecular analyses in vivo, we show that a small network of basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors controls both stemness and bi-potential differentiation in the Drosophila adult intestine. We find that homodimers of Daughterless (Da, homolog to mammalian E proteins) maintain the self-renewal of intestinal stem cells and antagonise the activity of heterodimers of Da and Scute (Sc, homolog to ASCL and known to promote intestinal secretory differentiation). We find a novel role for the HLH factor Extramacrochaetae (Emc, homolog to Id proteins), titrating Da and Sc to promote absorptive differentiation. We further show that Emc prevents committed absorptive progenitors from de-differentiating, underscoring the plasticity of these cells. Switching physical interaction partners in this way enables the active maintenance of stemness, but primes stem cells for differentiation along two alternative fates. Such regulatory logic could be recapitulated in other bipotent stem cell systems.",

Whether these effects translate into changes in the plants reproductive success remains unknown. In our study, flowers of Brassica napus were inoculated with the phyllospheric bacteria Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas syringae. Next-generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of bacterial communities associated with flowers showed that inoculation was efficient and affected bacterial communities throughout the flowering time of individual flowers. Flowers of B. napus inoculated with P. agglomerans and P. syringae were preferred by pollinators in the field or in olfactometer assays. Presumably due to the increased visitation rates, inoculated plants produced more seeds of tendentially higher quality per flower. Floral scent emissions were affected by time after inoculation and by treatment with bacterial strains, potentially explaining the behavioral responses of pollinators. Controlled laboratory experiments showed that bacteria emit volatiles through their own metabolism and that the concentrations of some floral volatiles can be reduced by bacteria. Furthermore, our results also suggest that bacteria can use floral scent compounds as carbon sources. Our results demonstrate a significant effect of floral bacteria on the pollination and reproduction of entomophilous plants that is at least partly mediated by their effects on floral chemical signaling.",

    "abstract": "Species richness is the most commonly used metric to quantify biodiversity. However, examining dark diversity, the group of missing species which can potentially inhabit a site, can provide a more thorough understanding of the processes influencing observed biodiversity and help evaluate the restoration potential of local habitats. So far, dark diversity has mainly been studied for specific habitats or largescale landscapes while less attention has been given to variation across broad environmental gradients or as a result of local conditions and biotic interactions. In this study, we investigate the importance of local environmental conditions in determining dark diversity and observed richness in plant communities across broad environmental gradients. We use the ecospace concept to investigate how abiotic gradients (defined as position), availability of biotic resources (defined as expansion), spatiotemporal extent of habitats (defined as continuity), as well as species interactions through competition, relate to these biodiversity measures. Position variables were important for both plant richness and dark diversity, some with quadratic relationships, e.g., plant richness showing a unimodal response to soil fertility corresponding to the intermediate productivity hypothesis. Competition represented by community mean Grime C showed a negative correlation with plant richness. Besides position, organic carbon was the most important variable for dark diversity, indicating that in late succession habitats such as forests and shrubs, dark diversity is generally low. The importance of Grime C indicate that intermediate disturbance, such as grazing, may facilitate higher species richness and lower dark diversity. Comparing various biodiversity metrics and their influencing factors might reveal important drivers of biodiversity changes and result in better conservation decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, target enrichment sequencing of nuclear ultraconserved DNA elements (UCEs) now allows routinely inferring phylogenetic relationships from thousands of genomic markers. Recently, it has been shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is frequently sequenced alongside the targeted loci in such capture experiments. Despite its broad evolutionary interest, mtDNA is rarely assembled and used in conjunction with nuclear markers in capture-based studies. Here, we developed MitoFinder, a user-friendly bioinformatic pipeline, to efficiently assemble and annotate mitogenomic data from hundreds of UCE libraries. As a case study, we used ants (Formicidae) for which 501 UCE libraries have been sequenced whereas only 29 mitogenomes are available. We compared the efficiency of four different assemblers (IDBA-UD, MEGAHIT, MetaSPAdes, and Trinity) for assembling both UCE and mtDNA loci. Using MitoFinder, we show that metagenomic assemblers, in particular MetaSPAdes, are well suited to assemble both UCEs and mtDNA. Mitogenomic signal was successfully extracted from all 501 UCE libraries allowing confirming species identification using COI barcoding. Moreover, our automated procedure retrieved 296 cases in which the mitochondrial genome was assembled in a single contig, thus increasing the number of available ant mitogenomes by an order of magnitude. By leveraging the power of metagenomic assemblers, MitoFinder provides an efficient tool to extract complementary mitogenomic data from UCE libraries, allowing testing for potential mito-nuclear discordance. Our approach is potentially applicable to other sequence capture methods, transcriptomic data, and whole genome shotgun sequencing in diverse taxa.",

Therefore, the cecum provides a rich environment for bacteria to horizontally transfer genes between one another via mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and bacteriophages. In this study, we used broiler chicken cecum as a model to investigate antibiotic resistance genes that can be transferred in vitro from ceca flora to Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (S. Heidelberg). We used whole genome sequencing and resistome enrichment to decipher the interactions between S. Heidelberg, gut microbiome and acquired antibiotic resistance. After 48 h incubation of ceca under microaerophilic conditions, one S. Heidelberg isolate was recovered with an acquired Inck2 plasmid (88 kb) encoding extended {beta}-lactamase producing gene (blaCMY-2). In vitro, this plasmid was transferrable between E. coli and S. Heidelberg strains, but transfer was unsuccessful between S. Heidelberg strains. An in-depth genetic characterization of transferred plasmids suggests that they share significant homology with P1-like phages. This study contributes to our understanding of the dynamics between an important food-borne pathogen and the chicken gut microbiome.\\n\\nImportanceS. Heidelberg is a clinically important serovar, linked to food-borne illness and among the top 5 serovars isolated from poultry in USA and Canada. Acquisition of new genetic material from microbial flora in the gastrointestinal tract of food animals, including broilers, may contribute to increased fitness of pathogens like S. Heidelberg and may increase their level of antibiotic tolerance. Therefore, it is critical to gain a better understanding on the dynamic interactions that occur between important pathogens and the commensals present in the animal gut and other agroecosystems. In this study, we show that the native flora in the broiler ceca were capable of transferring mobile genetic elements carrying AmpC {beta}-lactamase (blaCMY-2) gene to an important food-borne pathogen S. Heidelberg. The potential role for P1-like bacteriophage transduction was also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and aging is its major risk factor. Changes in telomere length have been associated with aging and some degenerative diseases. Our aim was to explore some of the molecular changes caused by the progression of AD in a transgenic murine model (3xTg-AD; B6; 129-Psen1 <tm1Mpm> Tg (APPSwe, tauP301L) 1Lfa). Telomere length was assessed by qPCR in both brain tissue and peripheral blood cells and compared between three age groups: 5, 9, and 13 months. In addition, a possible effect of oxidative stress on telomere length and AD progression was explored. Shorter telomeres were found in blood cells of older transgenic mice compared to younger and wild type mice but no changes in telomere length in the hippocampus. An increase in oxidative stress with age was found for all strains but no correlation was found between oxidative stress and shorter telomere length for transgenic mice. Telomere length and oxidative stress are affected by AD progression in the 3xTg-AD murine model. Changes in blood cells are more noticeable than changes in brain tissue, suggesting that systemic changes can be detected early in the disease in this murine model.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of ethanol-inducible CYP2E1 to interact with other cytochrome P450 species and affect the metabolism of their substrates. As a model system we used CYP2E1-enriched microsomes obtained by incorporation of purified CYP2E1 protein into HLM. Using the method based on homo-FRET in homo-oligomers of CYP2E1 labeled with BODIPY 577/618 maleimide we demonstrated that the interactions of CYP2E1 with microsomes result in dissociation of the protein homo-oligomers. The finding that this effect is much better pronounced in HLM as compared to the microsomes containing no P450 proteins indicates the formation of mixed oligomers of CYP2E1 with other P450 species that takes place in expense of dissociation of the homo-oligomers.\\n\\nIncorporation of CYP2E1 into HLM results in a multifold increase in the rate of metabolism of CYP2E1-specific substrates p-Nitrophenol (pNP) and Chlorzaxozone (CLZ). The rate of their oxidation remains proportional to the amount of incorporated CYP2E1 up to the content of 0.3-0.4 nmol/mg protein (or about 50% CYP2E1 in the P450 pool). These results demonstrate that the incorporated CYP2E1 becomes a fully-functional member of the P450 ensemble and do not exhibit any detectable functional differences with the endogenous CYP2E1 in HLM.\\n\\nEnrichment of HLM with CYP2E1 results in a pronounced alteration of the metabolism of 7-etoxy-4-cyanocoumarin (CEC), the substrate of CYP2C19 and CYP1A2, that suggests an important augmentation of the involvement of CYP1A2 in its metabolism. This effect goes together with a remarkable increase in the rate of dealkylation of CYP1A2-specific substrate 7-ethoxyresorufin by CYP2E1-enriched HLM. Furthermore, probing the interactions of CYP2E1 with model microsomes (Supersomes) containing individual P450 enzymes we found that CYP2E1 efficiently interacts with CYP1A2, but lacks any ability to form complexes with CYP2C19. This finding goes inline with CYP2E1-induced redirection of the main route of CEC metabolism from CYP2C19 to CYP1A2.",

    "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHR) are data generated during routine interactions across healthcare settings and contain rich, longitudinal information on diagnoses, symptoms, medications, investigations and tests. A primary use-case for EHR is the creation of phenotyping algorithms used to identify disease status, onset and progression or extraction of information on risk factors or biomarkers. Phenotyping however is challenging since EHR are collected for different purposes, have variable data quality and often require significant harmonization. While considerable effort goes into the phenotyping process, no consistent methodology for representing algorithms exists in the UK. Creating a national repository of curated algorithms can potentially enable algorithm dissemination and reuse by the wider community. A critical first step is the creation of a robust minimum information standard for phenotyping algorithm components (metadata, implementation logic, validation evidence) which involves identifying and reviewing the complexity and heterogeneity of current UK EHR algorithms. In this study, we analyzed all available EHR phenotyping algorithms (n=70) from two large-scale contemporary EHR resources in the UK (CALIBER and UK Biobank). We documented EHR sources, controlled clinical terminologies, evidence of algorithm validation, representation and implementation logic patterns. Understanding the heterogeneity of UK EHR algorithms and identifying common implementation patterns will facilitate the design of a minimum information standard for representing and curating algorithms nationally and internationally.",

The fusion protein bound avidly to the cognate antigen (the alternatively-spliced EDB domain of fibronectin), retained the activity of the parental cyto-kine and was able to selectively localize to murine tumors in vivo, as shown by quantitative biodistribution analysis. L19-mIL12 exhibited a potent anti-tumor activity in immunocompetent mice bearing CT26 carcinomas and WEHI-164 sarcomas, which could be boosted by combination with check-point blockade, leading to durable cancer eradication. L19-mIL12 also inhibited tumor growth in mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), but in this case cancer cures could not be obtained, both in monotherapy and in combination. A microscopic analysis and a depletion experiment of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes illustrated the contribution of NK cells and CD8+ T cells for the anti-cancer activity observed in both tumor models. Upon L19-mIL12 treatment, the density of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was strongly increased in LLC, but not in CT26 tumors. A FACS analysis also revealed that the majority of CD8+ T cells in CT26 tumors were specific to the retroviral AH1 antigen.\\n\\nNOVELTY AND IMPACT STATEMENTIn this study, we describe the generation of a novel fusion protein consisting of murine inter-leukin-12 fused to the L19 antibody (specific to the EDB domain of fibronectin).

We now describe the deployment of LPL by BC cells. Our data support a model in which LPL is bound to a heparin-like heparan sulfate proteoglycan motif on the BC cell surface and acts in concert with the VLDL receptor to rapidly internalize intact lipoproteins via receptor-mediated endocytosis. We further observe substantial alterations in gene expression programs related to pathways for lipid acquisition (synthesis vs. uptake) in response to each the availability of exogenous triglyceride in tissue culture media and LPL expression status. Current literature emphasizes de novo fatty acid synthesis as the paramount mechanism for lipid acquisition by cancer cells. Our findings indicate that exogenous lipid uptake can serve as an important method of lipid acquisition for cancer cells, alongside de novo lipogenesis, and that the relative reliance on these two modes of lipid acquisition may vary among different BC cell lines and in response to nutrient availability. This concept has obvious implications for the development of therapies aimed at the lipid dependence of many different cancer types. Moreover, the mechanism that we have elucidated provides a direct connection between dietary fat and tumor biology.",

Execution of this translation program is essential for assembling the molecular machinery required for meiotic progression, fertilization, and embryo development. With the present study, we used a RiboTag/RNA-Seq approach to explore the timing of maternal mRNA translation in quiescent oocytes as well as in oocytes progressing through the first meiotic division. This genome-wide analysis reveals a global switch in maternal mRNA translation coinciding with oocyte re-entry into the meiotic cell cycle. Messenger RNAs whose translation is highly active in quiescent oocytes invariably become repressed during meiotic re-entry, whereas transcripts repressed in quiescent oocytes become activated. Experimentally, we have defined the exact timing of the switch, the repressive function of CPE elements, and identified a novel role for CPEB1 in maintaining constitutive translation of a large group of maternal mRNAs during maturation.",

    "abstract": "Our prior studies found differences in the AKR/J and DBA/2J strains in regard to atherosclerosis and macrophage phenotypes including cholesterol ester loading, cholesterol efflux, and autolysosome formation. The goal of this study was to determine if there were differences in macrophage lysosome function, and if so to use quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to identify the causal gene. Lysosome function was measured by incubation with an exogenous double-labeled ovalbumin indicator sensitive to proteolysis. DBA/2J vs. AKR/J bone marrow macrophages had significantly decreased lysosome function. Macrophages were cultured from 120 mice derived from an AKR/JxDBA/2J F4 intercross. We measured lysosome function and performed a high density genome scan. QTL analysis yielded two genome wide significant loci on chromosomes 6 and 17, called macrophage lysosome function modifier (Mlfm) loci Mlfm1 and Mlfm2. After adjusting for Mlfm1, two additional loci were identified. Based on proximity to the Mlfm1 peak, macrophage mRNA expression differences with AKR/J >> DBA/2J, and a protein coding nonsense variant in DBA/2J, the Gpnmb gene, encoding a lysosomal membrane protein, was our top candidate. To test this candidate, Gpnmb expression was knocked down with siRNA in AKR/J macrophages; and, to express the wildtype Gpnmb in DBA/2J macrophages, we obtained a DBA/2 substrain, DBA/2J-Gpnmb+/SjJ, which was isolated from the parental strain prior to its acquiring the nonsense mutation, and subsequently back crossed to the modern DBA/2J background. Knockdown of Gpnmb in AKR/J macrophages decreased lysosome function, while restoration of the wildtype Gpnmb allele in DBA/2J macrophages increased lysosome function. However, this modifier of lysosome function was not responsible for the strain differences in macrophage cholesterol ester loading or cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, we identified the Gpnmb gene as the major modifier of lysosome function and we showed that the  QTL in a dish strategy is efficient in identifying modifier genes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInbred strains of mice differ in both their genetic backgrounds as well as in many traits; and, classical mouse genetics allows the mapping of genes responsible for these traits. We identified many traits that differ between the inbred strains AKR/J and DBA/2J, including atherosclerosis susceptibility, macrophage cholesterol metabolism, and in the current study, macrophage protein degradation via an organelle called the lysosome. Using mouse genetic mapping and bioinformatics we identified a candidate gene, called Gpnmb, responsible for modifying lysosome function; and, the DBA/2J strain carries a mutation in this gene. Here we demonstrate that the Gpnmb gene is a modifier of lysosome function by either correcting this Gpnmb mutation in DBA/2J macrophages, or by knocking down Gpnmb expression in AKR/J macrophages. This study is noteworthy as the human GPNMB gene has been implicated in many diseases including cancer, kidney injury, obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, Parkinson disease, osteoarthritis, and lysosome storage disorders.",

    "abstract": "Experimental ocular hypertension induces senescence of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that mimicks events occurring in human glaucoma. Senescence-related chromatin remodeling leads to profound transcriptional changes including the upregulation of a subset of genes that encode multiple proteins collectively referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Emerging evidence suggests that the presence of these proinflammatory and matrix-degrading molecules has deleterious effects in a variety of tissues. In the current study, we demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model that early removal of senescent cells induced upon elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) protects unaffected RGCs from senescence and apoptosis. Visual evoked potential (VEP) analysis demonstrated that remaining RGCs are functional and that the treatment protected visual functions. Finally, removal of endogenous senescent retinal cells after IOP elevation by a treatment with senolytic drug dasatinib prevented loss of retinal functions and cellular structure. Senolytic drugs may have the potential to mitigate the deleterious impact of elevated IOP on RGC survival in glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.",

The effects of past experiences on choices, often called sequential biases, are ubiquitous in perceptual and value-based decision-making, but their neural substrates are unclear. We trained rats to choose between explicitly cued guaranteed and probabilistic rewards in a task in which outcomes on each trial were independent. Behavioral variability often reflected the effects of previous trials, including increased willingness to take risks following risky wins, and spatial \\\"win-stay/lose-shift\\\" biases. Electrophysiological recordings from lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) revealed strong encoding of reward history and receipt, and optogenetic inhibition of lOFC during choice reporting eliminated rats increased preference for risk on subsequent trials following risky wins, but spared other sequential effects. Our data show that different sequential biases are neurally dissociable, and that the lOFCs role in adaptive behavior promotes learning of more abstract, task-specific biases (here, biases for the risky option), but not spatial ones. These data are consistent with proposals that the OFC represents the animals location in an abstract representation of task states, and highlight the lOFCs role in learning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptomics data, often referred as RNA-Seq, are increasingly being adopted in clinical practice due to the opportunity to answer several questions with the same data - e.g. gene expression, splicing, allele-specific expression even without matching DNA. Indeed, recent studies showed how RNA-Seq can contribute to decipher the impact of germline variants. These efforts allowed to dramatically improved the diagnostic yield in specific rare disease patient cohorts. Nevertheless, RNA-Seq is not routinely adopted for germline variant calling in the clinic. This is mostly due to a combination of technical noise and biological processes that affect the reliability of results, and are difficult to reduce using standard filtering strategies.\\n\\nResultsTo provide reliable germline variant calling from RNA-Seq for clinical use, such as for mendelian diseases diagnosis, we developed SmartRNASeqCaller: a Machine Learning system focused to reduce the burden of false positive calls from RNA-Seq. Thanks to the availability of large amount of high quality data, we could comprehensively train SmartRNASeqCaller using a suitable features set to characterize each potential variant.\\n\\nThe model integrates information from multiple sources, capturing variant-specific characteristics, contextual information, and external sources of annotation. We tested our tool against state-of-the-art workflows on a set of 376 independent validation samples from GIAB, Neuromics, and GTEx consortia. SmartRNASeqCaller remarkably increases precision of RNA-Seq germline variant calls, reducing the false positive burden by 50% without strong impact on sensitivity. This translates to an average precision increase of 20.9%, showing a consistent effect on samples from different origins and characteristics.\\n\\nConclusionsSmartRNASeqCaller shows that a general strategy adopted in different areas of applied machine learning can be exploited to improve variant calling. Switching from a naive hard-filtering schema to a more powerful, data-driven solution enabled a qualitative and quantitative improvement in terms of precision/recall performances. This is key for the intended use of SmartRNASeqCaller within clinical settings to identify disease-causing variants.",

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received an oral gavage of ethanol (1g/kg maternal body weight, n=9 dams) or an equivalent volume of saline (control, n=8 dams) at embryonic days 13.5 and 14.5. PAE resulted in a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05-0.06% 1h post-gavage in dams. Fasting blood glucose concentration was not affected by PAE in offspring at any age, nor were blood glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test (GTT) in 6-month old offspring (P>0.5). However, there was evidence of insulin resistance in PAE male offspring at 6 months of age, with significantly elevated fasting plasma insulin (P = 0.001), a tendency for increased first phase insulin secretion during the GTT and impaired glucose clearance following an insulin challenge (P = 0.007). This was accompanied by modest alterations in protein kinase B (AKT) signalling in adipose tissue. PAE also resulted in reduced calorie consumption by offspring compared to controls (P = 0.04). These data suggest that a relatively low-level, acute PAE programs metabolic dysfunction in offspring in a sex-specific manner. These results highlight that alcohol consumption during pregnancy has the potential to affect the long-term health of offspring.\\n\\nKey points summaryO_LIPrenatal alcohol exposure has the potential to affect fetal development and program chronic disease in offspring.\\nC_LIO_LIPrevious preclinical models typically use high, chronic doses of alcohol throughout pregnancy to examine effects on offspring, particularly on the brain and behaviour.\\nC_LIO_LIIn this study we use a rat model of moderate, acute, prenatal alcohol exposure to determine if this can be detrimental to maintenance of glucose homeostasis in adolescent and adult offspring.\\nC_LIO_LIAlthough female offspring were relatively unaffected, there was evidence of insulin resistance in 6-month old male offspring exposed to prenatal alcohol, suggestive of a pre-diabetic state.\\nC_LIO_LIThis result suggests that even a relatively low-dose, acute exposure to alcohol during pregnancy can still program metabolic dysfunction in a sex-specific manner.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How coexistence of many species is maintained is a fundamental and unanswered question in ecology. Coexistence is a puzzle because we lack a quantitative understanding of the variation in species presence and abundance. Whether variation in ecological communities is driven by deterministic or random processes is one of the most controversial issues in ecology. Here, we study the variation of species presence and abundance in microbial communities from a macroecological standpoint. We identify three novel, fundamental, and universal macroecological laws that characterize the fluctuation of species abundance across communities and over time. These three laws -- in addition to predicting the presence and absence of species, diversity and other commonly studied macroecological patterns -- allow to test mechanistic models and general theories aiming at describing the fundamental processes shaping microbial community composition and dynamics. We show that a mathematical model based on environmental stochasticity quantitatively predicts the three macroecological laws, as well as non-stationary properties of community dynamics.",

Because of the recent success in reprogramming islet derived cells into functional {beta}-cells in animal models, we constructed two highly complex barcoded replication competent capsid shuffled libraries and selected for high transducing variants on primary human islets. We describe a chimeric capsid (AAV-KP1) that penetrated and transduced primary human islet cells and human embryonic stem cell derived {beta}-cells with up to 10-fold higher efficiency compared to previously studied best in class AAV vectors. Remarkably, this chimeric capsid was also able to transduce both mouse and human hepatocytes at very high levels in a humanized-chimeric mouse model, thus providing a versatile vector which has the potential to be used in both preclinical testing and human clinical trials for both liver-based diseases and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly life stress has been associated with emotional dysregulations and altered architecture of limbic-prefrontal brain systems engaged in emotional processing. Serotonin regulates both, developmental and experience-dependent neuroplasticity in these circuits. Central serotonergic biosynthesis rates are regulated by Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), and transgenic animal models suggest that TPH2-gene associated differences in serotonergic signaling mediate the impact of aversive early life experiences on a phenotype characterized by anxious avoidance.\n\nMethodsThe present study employed an imaging genetics approach that capitalized on individual differences in a TPH2 polymorphism (703G/T; rs4570625) to determine whether differences in serotonergic signaling modulate the effects of early life stress on brain structure and function and punishment sensitivity in humans (n = 252).\n\nResultsHigher maltreatment exposure before the age of 16 was associated with increased gray matter volumes in a circuitry spanning thalamic-limbic-prefrontal regions and decreased intrinsic communication in limbic-prefrontal circuits selectively in TT carriers. In an independent replication sample, associations between higher early life stress and increased frontal volumes in TT carriers were confirmed. On the phenotype level, the genotype moderated the association between higher early life stress exposure and higher punishment sensitivity. In TT carriers, the association between higher early life stress exposure and punishment sensitivity was critically mediated by increased thalamic-limbic-prefrontal volumes.\n\nConclusionsThe present findings suggest that early life stress shapes the neural organization of the limbic-prefrontal circuits in interaction with individual variations in the TPH2 gene to promote a phenotype characterized by facilitated threat avoidance, thus promoting early adaptation to an adverse environment.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity often leads to alterations in gene expression and cellular architecture. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, owing to its compact translucent nervous system, is a powerful system in which to study conserved aspects of the development and plasticity of neuronal morphology. Here we focus on one sensory neuron in the worm, termed URX, which senses oxygen and signals tonically proportional to environmental oxygen. Previous studies have reported that URX has variable branched endings at its dendritic sensory tip. By controlling oxygen levels and analyzing mutants, we found that these branched endings grow over time as a consequence of neuronal activity. Furthermore, we observed that the branches contain microtubules, but do not appear to harbor the guanylyl cyclase GCY-35, a central component of the oxygen sensory transduction pathway. Interestingly, we found that although URX dendritic tips grow branches in response to long-term activity, the degree of branch elaboration does not correlate with oxygen sensitivity at the cellular or the behavioral level. Given the strengths of C. elegans as a model organism, URX may serve as a potent system for uncovering genes and mechanisms involved in activity-dependent morphological changes in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification (PTM) in many biological processes and is associated to human diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. The accurate identification, annotation and functional analysis of phosphosites is therefore crucial to understand their various roles. Phosphosites (P-sites) are mainly analysed through phosphoproteomics, which has led to increasing amounts of publicly available phosphoproteomics data. Several resources have been built around the resulting phosphosite information, but these are usually restricted to protein sequence and basic site metadata. What is often missing from these resources, however, is context, including protein structure mapping, experimental provenance information, and biophysical predictions. We therefore developed Scop3P: a comprehensive database of human phosphosites within their full context. Scop3P integrates sequences (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot), structures (PDB), and uniformly reprocessed phosphoproteomics data (PRIDE) to annotate all known human phosphosites. Furthermore, these sites are put into biophysical context by annotating each phosphoprotein with perresidue structural propensity, solvent accessibility, disordered probability, and early folding information. Scop3P, available at https://iomics.ugent.be/scop3p, presents a unique resource for visualization and analysis of phosphosites, and for understanding of phosphosite structure-function relationships.",

    "abstract": "Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion between 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate. In trypanosomatids enolase was proposed as a key enzyme after in silico and in vivo analysis and it was validated as a protein essential for the survival of the parasite. Therefore, enolase constitutes an interesting enzyme target for the identification of drugs against Chagas disease. In this work, a combined virtual screening strategy was implemented, employing similarity virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics. First, two known enolase inhibitors and the enzyme substrates were used as queries for the similarity screening on the Sweetlead database using five different algorithms. Compounds retrieved in the top 10 of at least three search algorithms were selected for further analysis, resulting in six compounds of medical use (etidronate, pamidronate, fosfomycin, acetohydroximate, triclofos, and aminohydroxybutyrate). Molecular docking simulations predicted acetohydroxamate and triclofos would not bind to the active site of the enzyme, and a re-scoring of the obtained poses signaled fosfomycin and aminohydroxybutyrate as bad enzyme binders. Docking poses obtained for etidronate, pamidronate, and PEP, were used for molecular dynamics calculations to describe their mode of binding. From the obtained results, we propose etidronate as a possible TcENO inhibitor, and describe desirable and undesirable molecular motifs to be taken into account in the repurposing or design of drugs aiming this enzyme active site.",

    "abstract": "Gene transfer and homologous recombination in Streptococcus pyogenes has the potential to trigger the emergence of pandemic lineages, as exemplified by lineages of emm1 and emm89 that emerged in the 1980s and 2000s respectively. Although near-identical replacement gene transfer events in the nga (NADase) and slo (Streptolysin O) locus conferring high expression of these toxins underpinned the success of these lineages, extension to other emm-genotype lineages is unreported. The emergent emm89 lineage was characterised by five regions of homologous recombination additional to nga/slo, including complete loss of the hyaluronic acid capsule synthesis locus hasABC, a genetic trait replicated in two other leading emm types and recapitulated by other emm types by inactivating mutations. We hypothesised that other leading genotypes may have undergone a similar recombination events. We analysed a longitudinal dataset of genomes from 344 clinical invasive disease isolates representative of locations across England, dating from 2001 to 2011, and an international collection of S. pyogenes genomes representing 54 different genotypes, and found frequent evidence of recombination events at the nga-slo locus predicted to confer higher toxin expression. We identified multiple associations between recombination at this locus and inactivating mutations within hasA/B, suggesting convergent evolutionary pathways in successful genotypes. This included common genotypes emm28 and emm87. The combination of no or low capsule, and high expression of nga and slo, may underpin the success for many emergent S. pyogenes lineages of different genotypes, triggering new pandemics and could change the way S. pyogenes causes disease.\\n\\nImportanceStreptococcus pyogenes is a genetically diverse pathogen, with over 200 different genotypes defined by emm typing, but only a minority of these genotypes are responsible for majority of human infection in high income countries. Two prevalent genotypes associated with disease rose to international dominance following recombination of a toxin locus that conferred increased expression. Here, we found that recombination of this locus and promoter has occurred in other diverse genotypes, events that may allow these genotypes to expand in the population. We identified an association between the loss of hyaluronic acid capsule synthesis and high toxin expression, which we propose may be associated with an adaptive advantage. As S. pyogenes pathogenesis depends both on capsule and toxin production, new variants with altered expression may result in abrupt changes in the molecular epidemiology of this pathogen in the human population over time.",

    "abstract": "DNA repair defects have been increasingly focused on as therapeutic targets. In hormone positive breast cancer, XRCC1-deficient tumors have been identified and proposed as targets for combination therapies that damage DNA and inhibit DNA repair pathways. XRCC1 is a scaffold protein that functions in base excision repair (BER) by mediating essential interactions between DNA glycosylases, AP endonuclease, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, DNA polymerase {beta} (POL {beta}), and DNA ligases. Loss of XRCC1 confers BER defects and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. BER defects have not been evaluated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which new therapeutic targets and therapies are needed. To evaluate the potential of XRCC1 as an indicator of BER defects in TNBC, we examined XRCC1 expression and localization in the TCGA database and in TNBC cell lines. High XRCC1 expression was observed for TNBC tumors in the TCGA database and expression of XRCC1 varied between TNBC cell lines. We also observed changes in XRCC1 subcellular localization in TNBCs that alter the ability to repair base lesions and single-strand breaks. Subcellular localization changes were also observed for POL {beta} that did not correlate with XRCC1 localization. Basal levels of DNA damage were also measured in the TNBC cell lines, and damage levels correlated with observed changes in XRCC1 expression, localization, and repair functions. The results confirmed that XRCC1 expression changes may indicate DNA repair capacity changes but emphasize that basal DNA damage levels along with expression and localization are better indicators of DNA repair defects. Given the observed over-expression of XRCC1 in TNBC preclinical models and the TCGA database, XRCC1 expression levels should be considered when evaluating treatment responses of TNBC preclinical model cells.",

Previous studies have a growing appreciation of purifying selection for the conserved mRNA structure across lineages of different species. However, the effect of mRNA structure on positive evolution remains unclear. Here, we construct a large-scale dataset of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at synonymous sites in the population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, combined with the experimental assessment of mRNA structure, and perform empirical population genetics data analysis through unfolded site-frequency spectra. Our results suggest that functional mRNA stem drives faster evolution of increasing GC contents itself with the purpose of regulating translational speed, which is greatly influenced by length. At the synonymous site without codon usage bias, this kind of positive selection still exists. Furthermore, mRNA secondary structure is subject to positive selection widespread among the yeast genome, particularly related to mitochondria activities, which is possibly aimed to achieve a balance between cellular respiration and alcoholic fermentation precisely at a non-protein level. It is conducive to the adaption of the dramatic environment alterations from wild to man-made environments during the domestication.",

In ILC, ER controls the expression of the Wnt ligand WNT4, which is critical for endocrine response and anti-estrogen resistance. However, signaling mediated by WNT4 is poorly understood. We utilized reverse phase protein array (RPPA) to characterize ER and WNT4-driven signaling in ILC cells and identified that WNT4 mediates downstream mTOR signaling via S6K. Additionally, independent of mTOR/S6K, ER and WNT4 control levels of MCL-1, which alters mitochondrial function. In this context, WNT4 knockdown caused decreased ATP production and increased mitochondrial fragmentation. WNT4 regulation of both mTOR signaling and MCL-1 were also observed in antiestrogen resistant models of ILC. Further, we identified that high WNT4 expression is associated with similar mTOR pathway activation in serous ovarian cancer tumors, suggesting that WNT4 signaling is important in multiple tumor types. The identified downstream pathways offer insight in to WNT4 signaling and represent potential targets to overcome anti-estrogen resistance for patients with ILC.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptionally inactive genes are often positioned at the nuclear lamina (NL), as part of large lamina-associated domains (LADs). Activation of such genes is often accompanied by repositioning towards the nuclear interior. How this process works and how it impacts flanking chromosomal regions is poorly understood. We addressed these questions by systematic manipulation of gene activity and detailed analysis of NL interactions. Activation of genes inside LADs typically causes detachment of the entire transcription unit but rarely more than 50-100 kb of flanking DNA, even when multiple neighboring genes are activated. The degree of detachment depends on the expression level and the length of the activated gene. Loss of NL interactions coincides with a switch from late to early replication timing, but the latter can involve longer stretches of DNA. These findings show how NL interactions can be shaped locally by transcription and point to a remarkable flexibility of interphase chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "The cardiomyopathy developed by patients with chronic Chagas disease (CCD), one of the most severe consequences of T. cruzi infection, is mainly associated with an imbalance between an excessive inflammatory reaction and a defective immunomodulatory profile cause by host-parasite interaction. Despite the growing importance of the regulatory function of B-cells in many malignancies, few studies have addressed their immunosuppressive role in chronic Chagas disease. In this work, we tackled this issue by studying the proportion of different B cell subpopulations and their capacity to secrete IL-10 in individuals with distinct clinical forms of CCD. Seven-colour flow cytometry was performed to examine the peripheral blood B cell compartment in chronic Chagas disease (CCD) patients with and without cardiac manifestations (n=10 for each group) and non-infected donors (n=9). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were incubated for 5h with PMA, ionomicyn and brefeldin A. According to the expression of markers CD19, CD24 and CD38, we showed an expansion of total B cell and transitional CD24highCD38high B cell subsets in CCD patients with cardiac involvement compared to non-infected donors. Furthermore, although no differences were observed in the frequency of total IL-10 producing B cells (B10) among the groups, CCD patients with cardiac involvement showed a statistically significant increased proportion of naive B10 cells and a tendency to an increased frequency of transitional B10 cells compared to non-infected donors. These findings suggest that immature transitional CD24highCD38high B cells are greatly expanded in patients with the cardiac form of chronic Chagas disease and these cells retain their ability to secrete IL-10 compared to non-infected donors. Furthermore, the distribution of naive, transitional and memory B cells inside the B10 cells followed the same pattern in chronic patients without cardiac involvement and non-infected individuals. Our work provides insight into the phenotypic distribution of regulatory B cell in CCD, an important step towards new strategies to prevent cardiomiopathy associated with T. cruzi infection.",

    "abstract": "Oxya chinensis is one of the most widespread grasshopper species found in China and one of the most common pests against rice. Due to the importance of haemocytes in insect immunity and limited information on the haemocytes of O. chinensis, their haemocytes were examined in detail. The cellular response of the grasshopper was challenged with bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. The morphology of the haemocytes was illustrated by the use of light, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, where different morphological varieties of haemocytes were observed. Granulocytes and plasmatocytes responded to the challenged bacteria by phagocytosis. The histochemical staining has indicated the presence of acid phosphatase in plasmatocytes and granulocytes. Non-phagocytic prohemocytes and vermicytes were noticed, but their functions in the circulation are unclear. Our results demonstrate an essential role of plasmatocytes and granulocytes in the innate immunity of O. chinensis. Insect haemocytes play a crucial role in cellular immunity, and further research is needed for a comprehensive understanding.\\n\\nSummary statementThe cellular response was used by Oxya chinensis against the bacterial challenges where two types of haemocytes shared the duty of phagocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Plants constitute an ecological niche for microbial communities that colonize different plant tissues and explore the plant habitat for reproduction and dispersal. The association of microbiota and plant may be altered by ecological and evolutionary changes in the host population. Seedborne microbiota, expected to be largely vertically-transferred, have the potential to co-adapt with their host over generations. Reduced host diversity because of strong directional selection and polyploidization during plant domestication and cultivation may have impacted the assembly and transmission of seed-associated microbiota. Nonetheless, the effect of plant domestication on the diversity of their associated microbes is poorly understood. Here we show that microbial communities in domesticated wheat, Triticum aestivum, are less diverse but more inconsistent among individual plants compared to the wild wheat species, T. dicoccoides. We found that diversity of microbes in seeds overall is low, but comparable in different wheat species, independent of their genetic and geographic origin. However, the diversity of seedborne microbiota that colonize the roots and leaves of the young seedling is significantly reduced in domesticated wheat genotypes. Moreover, we observe a higher variability between replicates of T. aestivum suggesting a stronger effect of chance events in microbial colonization and assembly. We also propagated wild and domesticated wheat in two different soils and found that different factors govern the assembly of soil-derived and seedborne microbial communities. Overall, our results demonstrate that the role of stochastic processes in seedborne microbial community assembly is larger in domesticated wheat compared to the wild wheat. We suggest that the directional selection on the plant host and polyploidization events during domestication may have decreased the degree of wheat-microbiota interactions and consequently led to a decreased stable core microbiota.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (meDNA) is a suspected modulator of alternative splicing, while splicing in turn is involved in tumour formations nearly as frequently as DNA mutations. Yet, the impact of meDNA on tumorigenesis via its effect on splicing has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we find that HCT116 colon carcinoma cells inactivated for the DNA methylases DNMT1 and DNMT3b undergo a partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with alternative splicing of the CD44 transmembrane receptor. The skipping of CD44 variant exons is in part explained by altered expression or splicing of splicing and chromatin factors. A direct effect of meDNA on alternative splicing was sustained by transient depletion of DNMT1 and the methyl-binding genes MBD1, MBD2, and MBD3. Yet, local changes in intragenic meDNA also altered recruitment of MBD1 protein and of the chromatin factor HP1{gamma} known to alter transcriptional pausing and alternative splicing decisions. We further tested if meDNA level has sufficiently strong direct impact on the outcome of alternative splicing to have a predictive value in the MCF10A model for breast cancer progression and in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B ALL). We found that a small number of differentially spliced genes mostly involved in splicing and signal transduction is systematically correlated with local meDNA. Altogether, our observations suggest that, although DNA methylation has multiple avenues to alternative splicing, its indirect effect may be also mediated through alternative splicing isoforms of these sensors of meDNA.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 50% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in deep remission experience a return of clinical CML after withdrawal of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This suggests signaling of inactive BCR-ABL, which allows for survival of cancer cells, leading to relapse. Understanding the dynamics of BCR-ABL signaling complex holds a key to the mechanism of BCR-ABL signaling. Here, we demonstrate that TKIs inhibit catalytic activity of BCR-ABL, but do not dissolve the BCR-ABL core signaling complex consisting of CrkL, SHC1, Grb2, SOS1, cCbl, and SHIP2. We show that CrkL binds to proline-rich regions located in C-terminal, intrinsically disordered region of BCR-ABL, that deletion of pleckstrin homology domain of BCR-ABL diminishes interaction with SHC1, and that BCR-ABL sequence motif located in disordered region around phosphorylated tyrosine 177 mediates binding of at least three core complex members, the Grb2, SOS1 and cCbl. Introduction of Y177F substitution blocks association with Grb2, SOS1 and cCbl. Further, we identified SHIP2 binding sites within the src-homology and tyrosine kinase domains of BCR-ABL. We found that BCR-ABL is unable to phosphorylate SHC1 in cells lacking SHIP2. Reintroducing SHIP2 into Ship2 knock-out cells restored SHC1 phosphorylation, which depended on inositol phosphatase activity of SHIP2. Our findings provide characterization of protein-protein interactions in the BCR-ABL signaling complex, and support the concept of targeting BCR-ABL signaling in CML by inhibition of its interactions with the members of the core complex.",

    "abstract": "Frameshifts in protein coding sequences are widely perceived as resulting in either non-functional or even deleterious protein products. Indeed, frameshifts typically lead to markedly altered protein sequences and premature stop codons. By analyzing complete proteomes from all three domains of life, we demonstrate that, in contrast, several key physicochemical properties of protein sequences exhibit significant robustness against +1 and -1 frameshifts in their mRNA coding sequences. In particular, we show that hydrophobicity profiles of many protein sequences remain largely invariant upon frameshifting. For example, over 2900 human proteins exhibit a Pearson correlation coefficient between the hydrophobicity profiles of the original and the +1-frameshifted variants greater than 0.7, despite a median sequence identity between the two of only 6.5% in this group. We observe a similar effect for protein sequence profiles of affinity for certain nucleobases, their matching with the cognate mRNA nucleobase-density profiles as well as protein sequence profiles of intrinsic disorder. Finally, we show that frameshift invariance is directly embedded in the structure of the universal genetic code and may have contributed to shaping it. Our results suggest that frameshifting may be a powerful evolutionary mechanism for creating new proteins with vastly different sequences, yet similar physicochemical properties to the proteins they originate from.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGenetic information stored in DNA is transcribed to messenger RNAs and then read in the process of translation to produce proteins. A frameshift in the reading frame at any stage of the process typically results in a significantly different protein sequence being produced and is generally assumed to be a source of detrimental errors that biological systems need to control. Here, we show that several essential properties of many protein sequences, such as their hydrophobicity profiles, remain largely unchanged upon frameshifts. This finding suggests that frameshifting could be an effective evolutionary strategy for generating novel protein sequences, which retain the functionally relevant physicochemical properties of the sequences they derive from.",

Here, we report that the BBB permeability is modified by apolipoprotein M (apoM)-bound sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). We used two-photon microscopy to monitor changes in BBB permeability in apoM-deficient mice (apoM-/-), showing significant increases in paracellular BBB permeability to small molecules without structural changes in junctional complexes between endothelial cells. Lack of apoM-bound S1P increased vesicle-mediated transfer of albumin across endothelium of brain pial and penetrating arterioles, whereas transcytosis in capillaries and venules remained unchanged. S1PR1 agonist SEW2871 rapidly normalized BBB permeability along both the paracellular and transcellular routes in apoM-/- mice. Thus, apoM-bound S1P maintains low paracellular BBB permeability for small molecules in all cerebral microvessels and low levels of adsorptive transcytosis in penetrating arterioles. Modulation of apoM/S1P-dependent signaling may be a novel strategy for the protection of brain endothelial cells to preserve the BBB function.",

    "abstract": "Therian female fertility is defined by a successful and strictly periodic ovarian cycle, which is under the control of gonadotropins and steroid hormones, particularly progesterone and estrogen. The latter two are produced by the ovaries that are engaged in controlled follicular growth, maturation and release of the eggs, i.e. ovulation. It is well known that steroid hormones regulate ovarian cycles via genomic signaling, by altering gene transcription and protein synthesis. However, despite this well-studied mechanism, steroid hormones can also signal via direct, non-genomic action, by binding to their membrane receptors. Here we show, that the recently discovered sperm membrane progesterone receptor /{beta} hydrolase domain-containing protein 2 (ABHD2) is highly expressed in mammalian ovaries where the protein plays a novel regulatory role in follicle maturation and the sexual cycle of females. Ablation of Abhd2 caused a dysregulation of the estrous cycle rhythm with females showing shortened luteal stages while remaining in the estrus stage for a longer time. Interestingly, the ovaries of Abhd2 knockout (KO) females resemble polycystic ovary morphology with a high number of atretic antral follicles that could be rescued with injection of gonadotropins. Such a procedure also allowed Abhd2 KO females to ovulate a significantly increased number of mature and fertile eggs in comparison to their wild-type littermates. These results suggest a novel regulatory role of ABHD2 as an important factor in non-genomic steroid regulation of the female reproductive cycle.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) have evolved to control diverse processes of growth, development, and immunity in plants; the mechanisms that link LRR-RKs to distinct cellular responses are not understood. Here we show that two LRR-RKs, the brassinosteroid hormone receptor BRI1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1) and the flagellin receptor FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSING 2), regulate downstream glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, respectively, through phosphocoding of the BRI1-SUPPRESSOR1 (BSU1) phosphatase. BSU1 was previously identified as a component that inactivates GSK3s in the BRI1 pathway. We found surprisingly that loss of the BSU1 family phosphatases activates effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and impairs flagellin-triggered MAP kinase activation and immunity. The flagellin-activated BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) phosphorylates BSU1 at serine-251. Mutation of serine-251 reduces the ability of BSU1 to mediate flagellin-induced MAP kinase activation and immunity, but not its abilities to suppress ETI and interact with GSK3, which is enhanced through the phosphorylation of BSU1 at serine-764 upon brassinosteroid signaling. These results demonstrate that BSU1 plays an essential role in immunity and transduces brassinosteroid-BRI1 and flagellin-FLS2 signals using different phosphorylation sites. Our study illustrates that phosphocoding in shared downstream components provides signaling specificities for diverse plant receptor kinases.",

    "abstract": "Learning and memory are regulated by neuromodulatory pathways, but the contribution and temporal requirement of most neuromodulators in a learning circuit are unknown. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved neuromedin U (NMU) neuropeptide family as a regulator of memory retrieval in C. elegans gustatory aversive learning. The NMU homolog CAPA-1 and its receptor NMUR-1 are required for the expression of learned salt avoidance. Aversive learning depends on the release of CAPA-1 neuropeptides from sensory ASG neurons that respond to salt stimuli in an experience-dependent manner. Optogenetic silencing of CAPA-1 neurons blocks the immediate retrieval, but not the acquisition, of learned salt avoidance. CAPA-1 subsequently signals through NMUR-1 in AFD sensory neurons to modulate two navigational strategies for salt chemotaxis. Aversive conditioning thus recruits NMU signaling to eventually modulate locomotor programs for expressing learned avoidance behavior. Because NMU signaling is conserved across bilaterian animals, our findings incite further research into its function in other memory and decision-making circuits.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=195 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/683888v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (58K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10bf862org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dfeb7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dda0b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@62bc95_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Most cucumber varieties have fruits with white flesh, which is devoid of {beta}-carotene and has a low concentration of total carotenoids. Carotenoids are important nutrients for humans and animals. Thus, developing cucumber varieties with orange flesh could provide a new nutritionally enhanced food source. Some cucumbers with yellow and orange flesh have been described, but there are others that have not been studied. Here, we used three cucumber PI lines, reported to produce colored fruits, from the USDA National Plant Germplasm System to generate three F2 populations. Fruits from the F2 populations with colored flesh (green, yellow, or orange) were pooled, and an equal number of fruits with white flesh were pooled. RNA was isolated from the pools and used for RNA sequencing to determine gene expression differences and to identify SNPs in each pool. The orange color of the cucumber fruits was confirmed to be due to {beta}-carotene. There were no clear expression patterns for genes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway that would suggest that their expression controlled the coloration of fruits. Mutations in carotenoid biosynthesis genes also did not explain the variation. However, we detected a SNP in the homolog of the Or gene that is responsible for {beta}-carotene accumulation in orange cauliflower. This genetic basis is different from that of previously studied orange cucumbers, but our results suggest that Or is not the only factor. These results provide the basis for future studies for breeding orange cucumbers for commercial or home garden production.",

    "abstract": "Bumblebees are critical pollinators whose populations have been experiencing troubling declines over the past several decades. Successful foraging improves colony fitness, thus understanding how anthropogenic influences modulate foraging behavior may aid conservation efforts. Odor pollution can have negative impacts on bumble- and honey-bees foraging behavior. However, given the vast array of potential scent contaminants, individually testing pollutants is an ineffective approach. The ability to quantitatively measure how much scent-pollution of a floral-odor bumblebees can tolerate would represent a paradigm shift in odor-pollution studies. Current statistical methods for analyzing complex odors have poor predictive power because statistically-derived odor-spaces are rewritten when new odors are added. This study presents an alternative method of analyzing complex odor blends based on the encoding properties of insect olfactory systems. This \\\"Compounds Without Borders\\\" (CWB) method vectorizes odors in a multidimensional space representing relevant functional group and carbon characteristics of their component odorants. A single vector can be built for any scent, which allows the angular distance between any two odors to be calculated - including a learned odor and its polluted counterpart. Data presented here indicate that CWB-angles are capable of both describing and predicting bumblebee odor-discrimination behavior: odor pairs with angular distances in the 20-29{degrees} range are generalized, while odor pairs over 30 degrees are differentiated. The neurophysiological properties underlying CWB-vectorization of odors are not unique to bumblebees; CWB-angle analysis of published data on a hawkmoth supports the idea that this method may have broader applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNanostructures generated by self-assembly of peptides yield nanomaterial that has many therapeutic applications, including drug delivery and biomedical engineering, due to their low cytotoxicity and higher uptake by targeted cells owing to their high affinity and specificity towards cell surface receptors. Despite the promising implications of this rapidly expanding field, there is no dedicated resource to study peptide nanostructures.\n\nResultThis study endeavours to create a dedicated repository of short peptides, which may prove to be the best models to study ordered nanostructures formed by peptide self-assembly. SAPdb has a repertoire of 1,049 entries of experimentally validated nanostructures formed by the self-assembling of small peptides. It includes 701 entries are of dipeptides, 328 entries belong to tripeptides, and 20 entries of single amino acid with some conjugated partners. Each entry encompasses comprehensive information about the peptide such as chemical modifications in the peptide sequences, the type of nanostructure formed, and experimental conditions like pH, temperature, and solvent required for the self-assembly of the peptide, etc. Further, our analysis has shown that the occurrence of aromatic amino acids favours the formation of self-assembling nanostructures, as indicated by a large number of entries in SAPdb contain aromatics amino acids. Besides, we have observed that these peptides form different nanostructures under different experimental conditions. SAPdb provides this comprehensive information in a hassle-free tabulated manner at a glance. User-friendly browsing, searching, and analysis modules are integrated for easy retrieval and comparison of data and examination of properties. We anticipate SAPdb to be a valuable repository for researchers engaged in the burgeoning arena of nanobiotechnology.\n\nAvailabilityThe database can be accessed on the web at https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/sapdb.",

    "abstract": "Withdrawal statementThe authors have withdrawn their manuscript from bioRxiv regretfully. During additional experiments for the revision we noticed inconsistencies in some results, which may affect the main conclusion of the manuscript. In particular, we noticed that using different primer pairs, some clones that were classified as homozygous knockouts, are actually not knockouts. These were unexpected findings, but might reflect the recently described larger rearrangements observed using CRISPR technology1,2,3,4. Follow up experiments are ongoing, but we would like to withdraw the manuscript at this point in time to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, the manuscript should currently not be cited. Any questions regarding the manuscript should be addressed to the corresponding author.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TF) regulate gene expression by binding to specific sequences known as motifs. A bottleneck in our knowledge of gene regulation is the lack of functional characterization of TF motifs, which is mainly due to the large number of predicted TF motifs, and tissue specificity of TF binding. We built a framework to identify tissue-specific functional motifs (funMotifs) across the genome based on thousands of annotation tracks obtained from large-scale genomics projects including ENCODE, RoadMap Epigenomics and FANTOM. The annotations were weighted using a logistic regression model trained on regulatory elements obtained from massively parallel reporter assays. Overall, genome-wide predicted motifs of 519 TFs were characterized across fifteen tissue types. funMotifs summarizes the weighted annotations into a functional activity score for each of the predicted motifs. funMotifs enabled us to measure tissue specificity of different TFs and to identify candidate functional variants in TF motifs from the 1000 genomes project, the GTEx project, the GWAS catalogue, and in 2,515 cancer samples from the Pan-cancer analysis of whole genome sequences (PCAWG) cohort. To enable researchers annotate genomic variants or regions of interest, we have implemented a command-line pipeline and a web-based interface that can publicly be accessed on: http://bioinf.icm.uu.se/funmotifs.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies have shown carry-over effects on brain activity and connectivity following both emotional and cognitive events, persisting even during subsequent rest. Here, we investigate the functional dynamics of such effects by identifying recurring co-activation patterns (CAPs). Using the precuneus as seed region, we compare carrying-over effects on brain-wide CAPs and their modulation after both affective and cognitive challenges. Female volunteers (n=19) underwent fMRI scanning during emotional induction with sad movie clips, and executive control tasks, each followed by resting periods. Several CAPs, overlapping the default mode, salience, attention, and social cognition networks were impacted by both the preceding events (movie or task) and their valence (neutral or negative), with differential fluctuations over time. Specifically, a modulation of CAPs in posterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was observed after exposure to negatively valenced emotional content and predicted changes in subjective affect. Additionally, CAPs in anterior cingulate cortex and dorsal fronto-parietal areas were induced by cognitive control in a negative, but not neutral context, and amplified by the task difficulty. These findings provide new insights on the anatomical organization and temporal inertia of intrinsic functional brain networks, engaged by transient emotions and presumably involved in subsequent adaptive homeostatic processes.",
