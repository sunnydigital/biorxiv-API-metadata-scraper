    "abstract": "In agricultural landscapes, management practices and other environmental and social factors shape complex agroecological matrices. In turn, the structure of such matrices impacts both agricultural activities and biodiversity conservation, for instance, by mediating wildlife migration between agricultural and habitat patches. One way to characterize a matrix, its potential role in biodiversity conservation, and how its descriptors change across different spatial scales, is characterizing heterogeneity metrics and systematically examining how such metrics change with grain size and landscape extent. However, these methods have rarely been applied to tropical, peasant-managed landscapes, even though this type of landscape occupies most of the agricultural surface in or near biodiversity hotspots. We focus on a peasant-managed agricultural landscape in Oaxaca, Mexico, for which we mapped and quantified the land-use classes and evaluated heterogeneity metrics. We also examined the response of heterogeneity metrics to changes in grain and extent scales. This allowed us to further understand the structure and conservation potential of the agroecological matrix in this type of landscape, to broadly compare this landscape with other agricultural landscapes in North America, and to recommend specific landscape metrics for different types of studies involving agricultural matrices. We conclude that this type of agricultural matrix is ideal to pursue joint agricultural and conservation strategies in an integrated landscape.",

    "abstract": "Human activities are greatly reducing the genetic diversity of species worldwide. Given the prediction that parasites better exploit less diverse host populations, many species could be vulnerable to disease outbreaks. However, the widespread nature of the  monoculture effect remains unclear outside agricultural systems. We conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies, obtaining a total of 66 effect sizes, to directly test the biological conditions under which host genetic diversity limits infectious disease in populations. Overall, we found broad support for the monoculture effect across host and parasite species. The effect was independent of host range, host reproduction, parasite diversity, and the method by which the monoculture effect was recorded. Conversely, we found that parasite functional group, virulence, and empirical environment matters. Together, these results highlight the general susceptibility of genetically homogenous populations to infection. Consequently, this phenomenon could become increasingly common and alarming for at-risk populations due to human-driven declines in genetic diversity and shifts in parasite distributions.",

    "abstract": "Most animals have a conserved mitochondrial genome structure composed of a single chromosome. However, some organisms have their mitochondrial genes separated on several smaller circular or linear chromosomes. Highly fragmented circular chromosomes (\\\"minicircles\\\") are especially prevalent in parasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera), with 16 species known to have between 9 and 20 mitochondrial minicircles per genome. All of these species belong to the same clade (mammalian lice), suggesting a single origin of drastic fragmentation. Nevertheless, other work indicates a lesser degree of fragmentation (2-3 chromosomes/genome) is present in some avian feather lice (Ischnocera: Philopteridae). In this study, we tested for minicircles in four species of the feather louse genus Columbicola (Philopteridae). Using whole genome shotgun sequence data, we applied three different bioinformatic approaches for assembling the Columbicola mitochondrial genome. We further confirmed these approaches by assembling the mitochondrial genome of Pediculus humanus from shotgun sequencing reads, a species known to have minicircles. All three methods indicated Columbicola spp. genomes are highly fragmented into 15-17 minicircles between 1,119 and 3,173 bp in length, with 1-4 genes per minicircle. Subsequent annotation of the minicircles indicated that tRNA arrangements of minicircles varied substantially between species. These mitochondrial minicircles for species of Columbicola represent the first feather lice (Philopteridae) for which minicircles have been found in a full mitochondrial genome assembly. Combined with recent phylogenetic studies of parasitic lice, our results provide strong evidence that highly fragmented mitochondrial genomes, which are otherwise rare across the Tree of Life, evolved multiple times within parasitic lice.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) of the oral cavity and pharynx is uncommon, and the characteristics and survival remains unclear. The present study aims to describe the clinicopathological characteristics and determine the factors associated with survival of this uncommon cancer. A population-based study was carried out to investigate clinical characteristics and prognosis of LEC of the oral cavity and pharynx using the data from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 1988 and 2013. The propensity-matched analysis was conducted for prognostic analysis, and a prognostic nomogram was also constructed. Totally, 1025 patients with LEC of the oral cavity and pharynx were identified, including 769 nasopharyngeal LEC patients and 256 non-nasopharyngeal LEC patients. The median OS of all LEC patients was 232.0m (95% CI 169.0-258.0). The 1-, 5-, 10- and 20-year survival rates were 92.9%, 72.9%, 59.3%, and 46.8%, respectively. Surgery could significantly prolong the survival time of LEC patients (P<0.01, mOS: 190m vs. 255m). Radiotherapy, as well as radiotherapy after surgery, could prolong the mOS (P<0.01 for both). The survival analysis demonstrated that old age (>60 years), lymph node (N3) and distant metastases were independent factors for poor survival, whereas radiotherapy and surgery were independent factors for favorable survival. No significant differences in survival time between nasopharyngeal LEC and non-nasopharyngeal LEC patients were observed. The prognostic nomogram was established base on five independent prognostic factors (C-index=0.70; 95% CI 0.66-0.74). In conclusion, LEC of the oral cavity and pharynx is a rare disease, and old age, lymph node and distant metastases, surgery and radiotherapy were significantly associated with prognosis. The prognostic nomogram could be used to make individual predictions of OS.",

    "abstract": "Face perception is a highly developed function of the human visual system. Previous studies of event-related potentials (ERPs) have identified a face-selective ERP component (negative peak at about 170 milliseconds after stimulation onset, N170) in healthy participants. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia exhibit reduced amplitude of the N170, which may represent a pathological deficit in the neurophysiology of face perception. Interestingly, healthy humans with schizophrenia-like experiences (schizotypy) also exhibit abnormal processing of face perception. Yet, it has remained unknown how schizotypy in healthy humans is associated with the neurophysiological substrate of face perception. Here, we recruited 35 participants and assessed their schizotypy by the magical ideation rating scale. We used high-density electroencephalography to obtain ERPs elicited by a set of Mooney faces (face and non-face conditions). We divided the participants into two groups (high and low schizotypy) by a median split of schizotypy scores. We investigated mean reaction times and the N170 component in response to the stimuli. We found significant slowed reaction times and reduced amplitude of the N170 component in response to the face stimuli in the high-schizotypy group. In addition, across the full data set, we found that the schizotypy scores were significantly correlated with both the reaction times and the N170 amplitude. Our results thus support the model of schizotypy as a manifestation of a continuum between healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia, where the N170 impairment serves as a biomarker for the degree of pathology along this continuum.",

    "abstract": "High glucose uptake by cancer compared to normal tissues has long been utilized in fluorodeoxyglucose-based positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as a contrast mechanism. The FDG uptake rate has been further related to the proliferative potential of cancer, specifically the proliferation index (PI) - the proportion of cells in S, G2 or M phases. The underlying hypothesis was that the cells preparing for cell division would consume more energy and metabolites as building blocks for biosynthesis. Despite the wide clinical use, mixed reports exist in the literature on the relationship between FDG uptake and PI. This may be due to the large variation in cancer types or methods adopted for the measurements. Of note, the existing methods can only measure the average properties of a tumor mass or cell population with highly-heterogeneous constituents. In this study, we have built a multi-modal live-cell radiography system and measured the [18F]FDG uptake by single HeLa cells together with their dry mass and cell cycle phase. The results show that HeLa cells take up twice more [18F]FDG in S, G2 or M phases than in G1 phase, which confirms the association between FDG uptake and PI at a single-cell level. Importantly, we show that [18F]FDG uptake and cell dry mass have a positive correlation in HeLa cells, which suggests that high [18F]FDG uptake in S, G2 or M phases can be largely attributed to increased dry mass, rather than the activities preparing for cell division. This interpretation is consistent with recent observations that the energy required for the preparation of cell division is much smaller than that for maintaining house-keeping proteins.",

Its widespread use is hampered by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which has high morbidity and mortality in both acute and chronic subtypes. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) occurs most frequently in skin and often is characterized by pathogenic fibrosis. Mast cells (MCs) are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of other fibrotic diseases. In a murine model of cGVHD after allo-HSCT, C57BL/6J recipients of allogeneic LP/J donor cells develop sclerodermatous dermal cGVHD which is significantly decreased in mast cell-deficient B6.Cg-KitW-sh/HNihrJaeBsmGlliJ recipients. MCs survive conditioning and are associated with fibrosis, chemokine production, and recruitment of GVHD effector cells to the skin. Chemokine production by MCs is blocked by drugs used to treat cGVHD. The importance of MCs in skin cGVHD is mirrored by increased MCs in the skin of patients with dermal cGVHD. We show for the first time a role for MCs in skin cGVHD that may be targetable for preventive and therapeutic intervention in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation of substrates and effectors is proposed to enhance biological reaction rates and efficiency. TPX2 is an effector of microtubule nucleation in spindles, and functions with the substrate tubulin by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that TPX2 phase separates into a co-condensate with tubulin, which mediates microtubule nucleation in vitro and in isolated cytosol. TPX2-tubulin co-condensation preferentially occurs on pre-existing microtubules at the endogenous and physiologically relevant concentration of TPX2. Truncation and chimera versions of TPX2 directly demonstrate that TPX2-tubulin co-condensation enhances the efficiency of TPX2-mediated microtubule nucleation. Finally, the known inhibitor of TPX2, the importin-/{beta} heterodimer, regulates both co-condensation and activity. Our study demonstrates how regulated phase separation can simultaneously enhance reaction efficiency and spatially coordinate microtubule nucleation, which may facilitate rapid and accurate spindle formation.",

    "abstract": "Motile cilia are widespread across the animal and plant kingdoms, displaying complex collective dynamics central to their physiology. Their coordination mechanism is not generally understood, with pre-vious work mainly focusing on algae and protists. We study here the synchronization of cilia beat in multiciliated cells from brain ven-tricles. The response to controlled oscillatory external flows shows that strong flows at a similar frequency to the actively beating cilia can entrain cilia oscillations. We find that the hydrodynamic forces required for this entrainment strongly depend on the number of cilia per cell. Cells with few cilia (up to five) can be entrained at flows comparable to the cilia-driven flows reported in vivo. Simulations of a minimal model of cilia interacting hydrodynamically show the same trends observed in cilia. Our results suggest that hydrody-namic forces between cilia are sufficient to be the mechanism behind the synchronization of mammalian brain cilia dynamics.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIt is shown experimentally, and also reproducing key qualitative results in a minimal mechanistic model simulated numerically, that in the motile cilia of the brain hydrodynamic forces of the magnitude that cilia themselves can generate are sufficient to establish the coordination of dynamics which is so crucial phys-iologically. This is the first experiment of its kind on multicilated cells, the key result is the unexpected importance of cilia num-ber per cell, with cells with fewer cilia much more susceptible to external flows. This finding changes the way in which we think about the question of collective cilia beating - it is not correct to simply examine isolated cilia and draw conclusions about the behaviour of cilia assemblies in multiciliated cells.",

    "abstract": "DNA Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is a major cause of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, and is also associated with increased risk of several other cancers. This is generally ascribed to the role of MMR in avoiding mutations by correcting DNA replication errors. In MMR knockout mice very high frequencies of somatic mutations, up until 100-fold of background, have been reported. However, these results have been obtained using bacterial reporter transgenes, which are not representative for the genome overall, and mutational patterns of MMR deficiency remain largely unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed single-cell whole-genome sequencing of lung fibroblasts of Msh2-/- and wild-type mice. We observed a 4-fold increase of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the fibroblasts of Msh2-/- mice compared to those of wild-type mice. The SNV signature of Msh2 deficiency was found to be driven by C>T and T>C transitions. By comparing it to human cancer signatures, we not only confirmed the inferred MMR-deficiency-related etiology of several cancer signatures but also suggested that MMR deficiency is likely the cause of a cancer signature with its etiology previously unknown. We also observed a 7-fold increase of somatic small insertions and deletions (INDELs) in the Msh2-/- mice. An elevated INDEL frequency has also been found in human MMR-related cancers. INDELs and SNVs distributed differently across genomic features in the Msh2-/- and control cells, with evidence of selection pressure and repair preference. These results provide insights into the landscape of somatic mutations in normal somatic cells caused by MMR deficiency.\\n\\nSignificanceOur results show that MMR deficiency in the mouse is associated with a much lower elevation of somatic mutation rates than previously reported and provides the first MMR whole-genome mutational landscapes in normal somatic cells in vivo.",

    "abstract": "CTCF binding contributes to the establishment of higher order genome structure by demarcating the boundaries of large-scale topologically associating domains (TADs). We have carried out an experimental and computational study that exploits the natural genetic variation across five closely related species to assess how CTCF binding patterns stably fixed by evolution in each species contribute to the establishment and evolutionary dynamics of TAD boundaries. We performed CTCF ChIP-seq in multiple mouse species to create genome-wide binding profiles and associated them with TAD boundaries. Our analyses reveal that CTCF binding is maintained at TAD boundaries by an equilibrium of selective constraints and dynamic evolutionary processes. Regardless of their conservation across species, CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries are subject to stronger sequence and functional constraints compared to other CTCF sites. TAD boundaries frequently harbor rapidly evolving clusters containing both evolutionary old and young CTCF sites as a result of repeated acquisition of new species-specific sites close to conserved ones. The overwhelming majority of clustered CTCF sites colocalize with cohesin and are significantly closer to gene transcription start sites than nonclustered CTCF sites, suggesting that CTCF clusters particularly contribute to cohesin stabilization and transcriptional regulation. Overall, CTCF site clusters are an apparently important feature of CTCF binding evolution that are critical the functional stability of higher order chromatin structure.",

    "abstract": "Blood-sucking insects incorporate many times their body weight of blood in a single meal. As proteins are the major component of vertebrate blood, its digestion in the gut of hematophagous insects generates extremely high concentrations of free amino acids. Previous reports showed that the tyrosine degradation pathway plays an essential role in adapting these animals to blood feeding. Inhibiting 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), the rate-limiting step of tyrosine degradation, results in the death of insects after a blood meal. Therefore, it was suggested that compounds that block the catabolism of tyrosine could act selectively on blood-feeding insects. Here we have evaluated the toxicity against mosquitoes of three HPPD inhibitors currently used as herbicides and in human health. Among the compounds tested, nitisinone (NTBC) proved to be more potent than mesotrione (MES) and isoxaflutole (IFT) in Aedes aegypti. NTBC was lethal to Ae. aegypti in artificial feeding assays (LD50: 4.36 {micro}M), as well as in topical application (LD50: 0.0033 nmol/mosquito). NTBC was also lethal to Ae. aegypti populations that were resistant to neurotoxic insecticides, and it was lethal to other mosquito species (Anopheles and Culex). Therefore, HPPD inhibitors, particularly NTBC, represent promising new drugs for mosquito control. Since they only affect blood-feeding organisms, they would represent a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional neurotoxic insecticides.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe control of mosquitoes has been pursued in the last decades by the use of neurotoxic insecticides to prevent the spreading of dengue, zika and malaria, among other diseases. However, the selection and propagation of different mechanisms of resistance hinder the success of these compounds. New methodologies are needed for their control. Hematophagous arthropods, including mosquitoes, ingest quantities of blood that represent many times their body weight in a single meal, releasing huge amounts of amino acids during digestion. Recent studies showed that inhibition of the tyrosine catabolism pathway could be a new selective target for vector control. Thus we tested three different inhibitors of the second enzyme in the tyrosine degradation pathway as tools for mosquito control. Results showed that Nitisinone (NTBC), an inhibitor used in medicine, was the most potent of them. NTBC was lethal to Aedes aegypti when it was administered together with the blood meal and when it was topically applied. It also caused the death of Anopheles aquasalis and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, as well as field-collected Aedes populations resistant to neurotoxic insecticides, indicating that there is no cross-resistance. We discuss the possible use of NTBC as a new insecticide.",

    "abstract": "When handling a structured population in association mapping, group-specific allele effects may be observed at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for several reasons: (i) a different linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and QTLs across groups, (ii) group-specific genetic mutations in QTL regions, and/or (iii) epistatic interactions between QTLs and other loci that have differentiated allele frequencies between groups. We present here a new genome-wide association (GWAS) approach to identify QTLs exhibiting such group-specific allele effects. We developed genetic materials including admixed progeny from different genetic groups with known genome-wide ancestries (local admixture). A dedicated statistical methodology was developed to analyze pure and admixed individuals jointly, allowing one to disentangle the factors causing the heterogeneity of allele effects across groups. This approach was applied to maize by developing an inbred \\\"Flint-Dent\\\" panel including admixed individuals that was evaluated for flowering time. Several associations were detected revealing a wide range of configurations of allele effects, both at known flowering QTLs (Vgt1, Vgt2 and Vgt3) and new loci. We found several QTLs whose effect depended on the group ancestry of alleles while others interacted with the genetic background. The existence of directional epistasis was highlighted by comparing admixed with pure individuals and was consistent with epistatic interactions identified at the level of QTLs. Our GWAS approach provides useful information on the stability of QTL effects across genetic groups and can be applied to a wide range of species.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIdentification of genomic regions involved in genetic architecture of traits has become commonplace in quantitative genetics studies. Genetic structure is a common feature in human, animal and plant species and most current methods target genomic regions whose effects on traits are conserved between genetic groups. However, a heterogeneity of allele effects may be observed due to different factors: a group-specific correlation between the alleles of the tagged marker and those of the causal variant, a group-specific mutation at the causal variant or an epistatic interaction between the causal variant and the genetic background. We propose a new method adapted to structured populations including admixed individuals, which aims to identify these genomic regions and to unravel the previous factors. method was applied to a maize inbred diversity panel including lines from the dent and the flint genetic groups, as well as admixed lines, evaluated for flowering time. Several genomic regions were detected with various configurations of allele effects, with evidence of epistatic interactions between some of the loci and the genetic background.",

    "abstract": "Geminiviruses are an important group of circular, single-stranded DNA viruses that cause devastating diseases in crops. Geminiviruses replicate their genomic DNA in the nucleus. The newly-synthesized viral DNA is subsequently transported to the cytoplasm, moved to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata with the help of viral movement proteins, and, ultimately, moved long-distance to establish systemic infection. Thus, the nucleocytoplasmic transportation is crucial for a successful infection by geminiviruses. For Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), the V1 protein is known to bind and shuttle viral genomic DNA, but the role of V2 protein in this process is still unclear. Here, we report that the nucleus-localized V1 protein dramatically decreases when co-expressed with V2 protein, and that V2-facilitated nuclear export of V1 protein depends on host exportin- and a specific V1-V2 interaction. Chemical inhibition of exportin- or a substitutions at cysteine 85 of V2 protein, which abolishes the V1-V2 interaction, blocks the promoted redistribution of V1 protein to the perinuclear region and the cytoplasm. When the V2C85S mutation is incorporated into a TYLCV infectious clone, the TYLCV-C85S causes delayed onset of very mild symptoms compared to wild-type TYLCV, indicating that the V1-V2 interaction and, thus, V2-mediated nuclear export of V1 protein is crucial for viral spread and systemic infection. Our data point to a critical role of the V2 protein in promoting the nuclear export of the V1 protein, likely by promoting V1-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transportation of TYLCV genomic DNA, and in turn, promoting viral systemic infection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAs both replication and the transcription of geminiviruses occur in the nucleus, transportation of the viral genomic DNA into and out of the nucleus of the infected cells is essential for a successful infection cycle. However, the nuclear export of geminiviruses is still little known and even less is known about the process for monopartite geminiviruses. We use TYLCV, a typical monopartite begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae, to examine the nucleocytoplasmic transportation. In this study, we found TYLCV V2 is able to redistribute the nucleus-localized V1 protein to the perinuclear region. Moreover, the nuclear export of V1 protein is dependent on the V1-V2 interaction and host exportin-. Blocking the V1-V2 interaction impeded the V2-mediated V1 protein redistribution and decrease TYLCV infection efficiency with delayed and mild symptoms. This report shows us a new explanation for the role of V2 in the nuclear export of V1 protein and TYLCV viral systemic infection.",

Accurate detection of these complex variants from whole genome sequencing data is influenced by a multitude of parameters. However, there are currently no tools for guiding study design nor are there applications that could predict the performance of somatic structural variant detection. To address this gap, we developed Shiny-SoSV, a user-friendly web-based calculator for determining the impact of common variables on the sensitivity and precision of somatic structural variant detection, including choice of variant detection tool, sequencing depth of coverage, variant allele fraction, and variant breakpoint resolution. Using simulation studies, we determined singular and combinatoric effects of these variables, modelled the results using a generalised additive model, allowing structural variant detection performance to be predicted for any combination of predictors. Shiny-SoSV provides an interactive and visual platform for users to easily compare individual and combined impact of different parameters. It predicts the performance of a proposed study design, on somatic structural variant detection, prior to the commencement of benchwork.

Glycine receptors are chloride-selective members of this receptor family that mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission and are implicated in neurological disorders including autism and hyperekplexia.

However, recent work has questioned the physiological relevance of this open state structure, since it rapidly collapses in molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we show that the collapse can be avoided by a careful equilibration protocol that reconciles the more problematic regions of the original electron-density map and gives a stable open state that shows frequent selective chloride permeation. The protocol developed in this work provides a means to refine open-like structures of the whole pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and reconciles the previous issues with the cryo-EM structure.",

The temporal order of DNA replication is determined by chromatin architecture and, more specifically, by chromatin contacts that are stabilized by RIF1. Here we show that RIF1 localizes in close proximity to newly synthesized DNA. In cells exposed to the DNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin, suppression of RIF1 markedly decreased the efficacy of protein isolation on nascent DNA (iPOND), suggesting that the iPOND procedure is biased by chromatin topology. RIF1 was required to limit the accumulation of DNA lesions induced by aphidicolin treatment and promoted the recruitment of cohesins in the vicinity of nascent DNA. Collectively, the data suggest that the stabilization of chromatin topology by RIF1 limits replication-associated genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "Preterm infants requiring prolonged oxygen therapy often develop cognitive dysfunction later life. Previously, we reported that 14-week-old young adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as newborns had spatial memory deficits and hippocampal shrinkage. We hypothesized that the underlying mechanism was the induction of hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction by neonatal hyperoxia. C57BL/6j mouse pups were exposed to 85% oxygen or air from P2 - P14. Hippocampal proteomic analysis was performed in young adult mice (14 weeks). Mitochondrial bioenergetics were measured in neonatal (P14) and young adult mice. We found that hyperoxia exposure reduced mitochondrial ATP-linked oxygen consumption and increased state 4 respiration linked proton leak in both neonatal and young adult mice. Following hyperoxia exposure, complex I function was decreased at P14 but increased in young adult mice. Proteomic analysis revealed that neonatal hyperoxia exposure decreased complex I NDUFB8 and NDUFB11 and complex IV 7B subunits, but increased complex III subunit 9 in young adult mice. In conclusion, neonatal hyperoxia permanently impairs hippocampal mitochondrial function and alters complex I function. These changes may account for memory deficits seen in preterm survivors following prolonged oxygen supplementation and may potentially be a contributing mechanism in other oxidative stress associated cognitive disorders.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional modifications of nucleotide bases can effect several aspects of mRNA function. For example, the recent work has established the role of m6A in the coordinated regulation of transcriptome turnover and translation during cellular differentiation and tumorigenesis. The levels of m1A in mRNAs reach up to 10% of those of m6A, yet the functional consequences of this modification are much less clear. Here we show that N1-methyladenine protects mRNAs against aberrant interactions during heat shock and amyloidogenesis in mammalian cells. The m1A methylation motif correlated with the enhanced sequestration of transcripts in stress granules (SG). The cognate methyltransferase TRMT6/61A accumulated and m1A was enriched in SG. Downregulation of the catalytic subunit TRMT61A enhanced amyloidogenesis in the cytosol and increased bystander protein and RNA co-aggregation with A{beta} aggregates. Faulty granulation of mutant RNAs has been implicated in pathogenesis of protein aggregation disorders. Our results demonstrate that also normal mRNAs succumb to co-aggregation with proteins if RNA dynamics during stress is disturbed due to the insufficient N1-adenine methylation.",

Yet, it remains unclear whether molecular mediators can generate variation and how this process is coordinated across loci to allow the emergence of new cell states. Using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a model of development, we found interconverting cell states that resemble developmental expression programs and vary in activity at specific enhancers, such as those regulating pluripotency genes Nanog and Sox2 but not Pou5f1 (Oct4). Variable enhancers drive expression of variable genes, including those encoding microRNAs (miRNAs). Notably, variable miRNAs increase cell-to-cell variation by acting on neighborhoods of pluripotency genes. The encoded, variable pluripotency factors bind variable enhancers, forming a feedback loop that amplifies variation and allows the emergence of new cell states.

    "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is a promising therapeutic target for immunological modulation. There is, however, a deficit of knowledge regarding CB2 signaling and function in human primary immunocompetent cells. We applied an experimental paradigm which closely models the in situ state of human primary leukocytes (PBMC; peripheral blood mononuclear cells) to characterize activation of a number of signaling pathways in response to a CB2-selective ligand (HU308). We observed a \\\"lag\\\" phase of unchanged cAMP concentration prior to development of classically-expected Gi-mediated inhibition of cAMP synthesis. Application of G protein inhibitors revealed that this apparent lag was a result of counteraction of Gi effects by concurrent Gs activation. Monitoring downstream signaling events, activation of p38 was mediated by Gi whereas ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation were mediated by Gi-coupled {beta}{gamma}. Activation of CREB integrated multiple components; Gs and {beta}{gamma} mediated [~]85% of the response, while [~]15% was attributed to Gi. Responses to HU308 had an important functional outcome - secretion of interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10). IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, MIP-1, and TNF- were unaffected. IL-6/IL-10 induction had a similar G protein coupling profile to CREB activation. All response potencies were consistent with that expected for HU308 acting via CB2. Additionally, signaling and functional effects were completely blocked by a CB2-selective inverse agonist, giving additional evidence for CB2 involvement. This work expands the current paradigm regarding cannabinoid immunomodulation and reinforces the potential utility of CB2 ligands as immunomodulatory therapeutics.\\n\\nSignificance statementCannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is a G protein-coupled receptor which plays a complex role in immunomodulation and is a promising target in a range of disorders with immune system involvement. However, to date the majority of the studies in this field have been performed on cell lines, rodent models, or stimulated primary cells. Here we provide a detailed account of CB2-mediated signaling in primary human immune cells under conditions which closely mimic their in vivo state. We reveal a complex signaling system involving an unprecedented CB2 signaling pathway and leading to immunomodulatory functional outcomes. This work provides not only a critical foundation impacting CB2-targeted drug discovery, but reveals important wider considerations for GPCR signaling studies and model validity.\\n\\nTable of Contents Summary Figure\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/663831v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (22K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@599095org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2331a9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@917860org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75e8f7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Early placental development and the establishment of the invasive trophoblast lineage take place within a low oxygen environment. However, conflicting and inconsistent findings have obscured the role of oxygen in regulating invasive trophoblast differentiation. In this study, the effect of hypoxic, normoxic, and atmospheric oxygen on invasive extravillous pathway progression was examined using a human placental explant model. Here, we show that exposure to low oxygen enhances extravillous column outgrowth and promotes the expression of genes that align with extravillous trophoblast (EVT) lineage commitment. By contrast, super-physiological atmospheric levels of oxygen promote trophoblast proliferation while simultaneously stalling EVT progression. Low oxygen-induced EVT differentiation coincided with elevated transcriptomic levels of lysyl oxidase (LOX) in trophoblast anchoring columns, where functional experiments established a role for LOX activity in promoting EVT column outgrowth. The findings of this work support a role for low oxygen in potentiating the differentiation of trophoblasts along the extravillous pathway. Additionally, these findings generate insight into new molecular processes controlled by oxygen during early placental development.\\n\\nSummary StatementLow oxygen promotes extravillous trophoblast differentiation",

In this study, we undertake a systematic characterization of the molecular mode-of-action of CT1 in mitigating the effects of ischemia reperfusion injury on ventricular contractile function.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsTo determine the basis of CT1-mediated increases in pS368 we undertook tandem mass spectrometry of reactants in an in vitro assay of PKC{varepsilon} phosphorylation, identifying an interaction between negatively charged amino acids in the CT1 Asp-Asp-Leu-Glu-Iso sequence and positively charged lysines (Lys345, Lys346) in a short -helical sequence (H2) within the Cx43 CT domain. In silico modeling provided further support of the specificity of this interaction, leading us to conclude that CT1 has potential to directly interact with both Cx43 and ZO-1. Using surface plasmon resonance, thermal shift and phosphorylation assays, we characterized a series of CT1 variant peptides, identifying sequences competent to interact with either ZO-1 PDZ2 or the Cx43 CT, but with limited or no ability to bind both polypeptides. Based on this analysis, it was found that only those peptides competent to interact with Cx43, but not ZO-1 alone, resulted in increased pS368 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in a mouse model of global ischemia reperfusion injury we determined that pre-ischemic infusion only with those peptides competent to bind Cx43 preserved left ventricular (LV) contractile function following injury. Interestingly, a short 9 amino acid (MW=1110) Cx43-binding variant of the original 25 amino acid CT1 sequence demonstrated potent LV-protecting effects when infused either before or after ischemic injury.\\n\\nConclusionsInteraction of CT1 with the Cx43 CT, but not ZO-1 PDZ2, explains cardioprotection mediated by this therapeutic peptide. Pharmacophores targeting the Cx43 carboxyl terminus could provide a novel translational approach to preservation of ventricular function following ischemic injury.",

    "abstract": "Molecular motors drive cytoskeletal rearrangements to change cell shape. Myosins are the motors that move, crosslink, and modify the actin cytoskeleton. The primary force generator in contractile actomyosin networks is non-muscle myosin II (NMMII), a molecular motor that assembles into ensembles that bind, slide, and crosslink actin filaments (F-actin). The multivalence of NMMII ensembles and their multiple roles have confounded the resolution of crucial questions including how the number of NMMII subunits affects dynamics, and what affects the relative contribution of ensembles crosslinking versus motoring activities. Since biophysical measurements of ensembles are sparse, modeling of actomyosin networks has aided in discovering the complex behaviors of NMMII ensembles. Myosin ensembles have been modeled via several strategies with variable discretization/coarse-graining and unbinding dynamics, and while general assumptions that simplify motor ensembles result in global contractile behaviors, it remains unclear which strategies most accurately depict cellular activity. Here, we used an agent-based platform, Cytosim, to implement several models of NMMII ensembles. Comparing the effects of bond type, we found that ensembles of catch-slip and catch motors were the best force generators and binders of filaments. Slip motor ensembles were capable of generating force but unbound frequently, resulting in slower contractile rates of contractile networks. Coarse-graining of these ensemble types from two sets of 16 motors on opposite ends of a stiff rod to two binders, each representing 16 motors, reduced force generation, contractility, and the total connectivity of filament networks for all ensemble types. A parallel cluster model (PCM) previously used to describe ensemble dynamics via statistical mechanics, allowed better contractility with coarse-graining, though connectivity was still markedly reduced for this ensemble type with coarse-graining. Together our results reveal substantial trade-offs associated with the process of coarse-graining NMMII ensembles and highlight the robustness of discretized catch-slip ensembles in modeling actomyosin networks.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEAgent-based simulations of contractile networks allow us to explore the mechanics of actomyosin contractility, which drives many cell shape changes including cytokinesis, the final step of cell division. Such simulations should be able to predict the mechanics and dynamics of non-muscle contractility, however recent work has highlighted a lack of consensus on how to best model the non-muscle myosin II. These ensembles of approximately 32 motors are the key components responsible for driving contractility. Here, we explored different methods for modeling non-muscle myosin II ensembles within the context of contractile actomyosin networks. We show that the level of coarse-graining and the choice of unbinding model used to model motor unbinding under load indeed has profound effects on contractile network dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\n\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.",

    "abstract": "Many sensory systems use stochastic fate specification to increase their repertoire of neuronal types. How these stochastic decisions are coordinated with the development of their target post-synaptic neurons in processing centers is not understood. In the Drosophila visual system, two subtypes of the UV-sensitive R7 color photoreceptors called yR7 and pR7 are stochastically specified in the retina. In contrast, the target neurons of photoreceptors in the optic lobes are specified through a highly deterministic program. Here, we identify subtypes of the main postsynaptic target of R7, the Dm8 neurons, that are each specific to the different subtypes of R7s. We show that during development the different Dm8 subtypes are produced in excess by distinct neuronal progenitors, independently from R7 subtype specification. Following matching with their respective R7 target, supernumerary Dm8s are eliminated by apoptosis. We show that the two interacting cell adhesion molecules Dpr11, expressed in yR7s, and its partner DIP{gamma}, expressed in yDm8s, are essential for the matching of the synaptic pair. Loss of either molecule leads to the death of yDm8s or their mis-pairing with the wrong pR7 subtype. We also show that competitive interactions between Dm8 subtypes regulate both cell survival and targeting. These mechanisms allow the qualitative and quantitative matching of R7 subtypes with their target in the brain and thus permit the stochastic choice made in R7 to propagate to the deterministically specified downstream circuit to support color vision.",

    "abstract": "During development, oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system extend a multitude of processes that wrap axons with myelin. The highly polarized oligodendrocytes generate myelin sheaths on many different axons, which are far removed from the cell body. Neurons use RNA binding proteins to transport, stabilize, and locally translate mRNA in distal domains of neurons. Local synthesis of synaptic proteins during neurodevelopment facilitates the rapid structural and functional changes underlying neural plasticity and avoids extensive protein transport. We hypothesize that RNA binding proteins also regulate local mRNA regulation in oligodendrocytes to promote myelin sheath growth. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein that plays essential roles in the growth and maturation of neurons, is also expressed in oligodendrocytes. To determine whether oligodendrocytes require FMRP for myelin sheath development, we examined fmr1-/- mutant zebrafish and drove FMR1 expression specifically in oligodendrocytes. We found oligodendrocytes in fmr1-/-mutants developed myelin sheaths of diminished length, a phenotype that can be autonomously rescued in oligodendrocytes with FMR1 expression. Myelin basic protein (Mbp), an essential myelin protein, was reduced in myelin tracts of fmr1-/- mutants, but loss of FMRP function did not impact the localization of mbpa transcript in myelin. Finally, expression of FMR1-I304N, a missense allele that abrogates FMRP association with ribosomes, failed to rescue fmr1-/- mutant sheath growth and induced short myelin sheaths in oligodendrocytes of wild-type larvae. Taken together, these data suggest that FMRP promotes sheath growth through local regulation of translation.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is a fundamental mechanism used by eukaryotic cells to maintain homeostasis and protein quality, and to control timing in biological processes. Two essential aspects of ubiquitin regulation are conjugation through E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascades, and recognition by ubiquitin-binding domains. An emerging theme in the ubiquitin field is that these two properties are often amalgamated in conjugation enzymes. In addition to covalent thioester linkage to ubiquitins C-terminus for ubiquitin transfer reactions, conjugation enzymes often bind non-covalently and weakly to ubiquitin at \\\"exosites\\\". However, identification of such sites is typically empirical and particularly challenging in large molecular machines. Here, studying the 1.2 MDa E3 ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which controls cell division and many aspects of neurobiology, we discover a method for identifying unexpected ubiquitin-binding sites. Using a panel of ubiquitin variants (UbVs) we identify a protein-based inhibitor that blocks ubiquitin ligation to APC/C substrates in vitro and ex vivo. Biochemistry, NMR, and cryo EM structurally define the UbV interaction, explain its inhibitory activity through binding the surface on the APC2 subunit that recruits the E2 enzyme UBE2C, and ultimately reveal that this APC2 surface is also a ubiquitin-binding exosite with preference for K48-linked chains. The results provide a new tool for probing APC/C activity, have implications for the coordination of K48-linked Ub chain binding by APC/C with the multistep process of substrate polyubiquitylation, and demonstrate the power of UbV technology for identifying cryptic ubiquitin binding sites within large multiprotein complexes.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUbiquitin-mediated interactions influence numerous biological processes. These are often transient or a part of multivalent interactions. Therefore, unmasking these interactions remains a significant challenge for large, complicated enzymes such as the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit RING E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase. APC/C activity regulates numerous facets of biology by targeting key regulatory proteins for Ub-mediated degradation. Using a series of Ub variants (UbVs), we identified a new Ub-binding site on the APC/C that preferentially binds to K48-linked Ub chains. More broadly, we demonstrate a workflow that can be exploited to uncover Ub-binding sites within ubiquitylation machinery and other associated regulatory proteins to interrogate the complexity of the Ub code in biology.",

    "abstract": "Multiplexed quantitative analyses of complex proteomes enable deep biological insight. While a multitude of workflows have been developed for multiplexed analyses, the most quantitatively accurate method (SPS-MS3) suffers from long acquisition duty cycles. We built a new, real-time database search (RTS) platform, Orbiter, to combat the SPS-MS3 methods longer duty cycles. RTS with Orbiter enables the elimination of SPS-MS3 scans if no peptide matches to a given spectrum. With Orbiters online proteomic analytical pipeline, which includes RTS and false discovery rate analysis, it was possible to process a single spectrum database search in less than 10 milliseconds. The result is a fast, functional means to identify peptide spectral matches using Comet, filter these matches, and more efficiently quantify proteins of interest. Importantly, the use of Comet for peptide spectral matching allowed for a fully featured search, including analysis of post-translational modifications, with well-known and extensively validated scoring. These data could then be used to trigger subsequent scans in an adaptive and flexible manner. In this work we tested the utility of this adaptive data acquisition platform to improve the efficiency and accuracy of multiplexed quantitative experiments. We found that RTS enabled a 2-fold increase in mass spectrometric data acquisition efficiency. Orbiters RTS was able to quantify more than 8000 proteins across 10 proteomes in half the time of an SPS-MS3 analysis (18 hours for RTS, 36 hours for SPS-MS3).",

The highly conserved dimeric interface harbors two active sites, making the dimer the obligatory functional unit. Yet, functionality of the recently evolved inter-dimeric interface remains unknown. Here, we show that the inter-dimeric interface of U. urealiticum MAT has evolved to control the catalytic activity and structural integrity of the homotetramer in response to product accumulation. When all four active sites are occupied with the product, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), binding of four additional SAM molecules to the inter-dimeric interface prompts a [~]45{degrees} shift in the dimer orientation and a concomitant [~]60% increase in the interface area. This rearrangement inhibits the enzymatic activity by locking the flexible active site loops in a closed state and renders the tetramer resistant to proteolytic degradation. Our findings suggest that the inter-dimeric interfaces of MATs are recruited by evolution to tune the molecular properties of the entire homotetramer.",

Here, as a model system we employ giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs), which largely preserve the plasma membrane lipidome and proteome. From analysis of fluorescence emission and lifetime of environment-sensitive dyes, and membrane shape fluctuations, we investigate how plasma membrane order, viscosity and bending rigidity are affected by different stimuli such as cell seeding density in three different cell models. Our studies reveal that bending rigidity of plasma membranes vary with lipid order and microviscosity in a highly correlated fashion. Thus, readouts from polarity- and viscosity-sensitive probes represent a promising indicator of membrane mechanical properties. Quantitative analysis of the data allows for comparison to synthetic lipid membranes as plasma membrane mimetics.",
