    "abstract": "Conjugative plasmids from the IncHI incompatibility group are relevant vectors for multidrug resistance. In this study, a comparison of the similarities and differences in the 44 publicly available sequences of IncHI plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae (1961-2013), revealed extensive conservation of their coding sequences. However, each genome had accessory regions with features of degradation or resistance to antibacterial agents. This article elucidates the IncHI1, IncHI2 and IncHI3 subgroup plasmids from the evolutive line based on multiple drug-resistant modules, explains the origin of the IncHI1 pAKU1-like composite transposon lineage, typifies the subgroup IncHI3, which is distantly related to IncHI1 and IncHI2 in phylogenetic analyses, confirms the relations within the transfer regions of H-group plasmids, and points to the divergence time of evolution with phylogenetic trees. Homology between subgroups, as measured by the molecular clock test, indicated that the contemporary IncHI1 and IncHI2 transfer region lineages diverged from an ancestral clone approximately 8,000 years ago (17,000 years ago if the divergent IncHI3 plasmids are included), although the IncH backbone was older. The uniformity of the composite transposon shared by most IncHI1 subgroup plasmids might be functionally equivalent to the heavy metal resistance that is mediated by some operons in the IncHI2 subgroup plasmids. A comparison of the DNA among these closely related plasmids provided insights on the horizontal and vertical transfers that were involved in their development.",

    "abstract": "A mental representation of the location of an object can be constructed using sensory information selected from the environment and information stored internally. Human electrophysiological evidence indicates that behaviorally relevant locations, regardless of the source of sensory information, are represented in alpha-band oscillations suggesting a shared process. Here we present evidence from human subjects of either sex for two distinct alpha-band based processes that separately support the representation of location, exploiting sensory evidence sampled either externally or internally.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOur sensory environment and our internal trains of thought are coded in patterns of brain activity and are used to guide coherent behavior. Oscillations in the alpha frequency band are a predominant feature of human brain activity. This oscillation plays a central role in both selective attention and working memory, suggesting that these important cognitive functions are mediated by a unitary mechanism. We show that the alpha oscillation reflects two distinct processes, one that is supported by continuous sampling of the external sensory environment, and one that is based on sampling from internal representations coded in visual short-term memory. This represents a significant change in our understanding of the nature of alpha oscillations and their relationship to attention and memory.",

    "abstract": "Environmental boundaries anchor cognitive maps that support memory. However, trapezoidal boundary geometry distorts the regular firing patterns of entorhinal grid cells proposedly providing a metric for cognitive maps. Here, we test the impact of trapezoidal boundary geometry on human spatial memory using immersive virtual reality. Consistent with reduced regularity of grid patterns in rodents and a grid-cell model based on the eigenvectors of the successor representation, human positional memory was degraded in a trapezoid compared to a square environment; an effect particularly pronounced in the trapezoids narrow part. Congruent with spatial frequency changes of eigenvector grid patterns, distance estimates between remembered positions were persistently biased; revealing distorted memory maps that explained behavior better than the objective maps. Our findings demonstrate that environmental geometry affects human spatial memory similarly to rodent grid cell activity -- thus strengthening the putative link between grid cells and behavior along with their cognitive functions beyond navigation.",

    "abstract": "Finding the right combination of a fluorescent dye and a mounting medium is crucial for optimal microscopy of fixed samples. It was recently shown that Vectashield, one of the most commonly used mounting media for conventional microscopy, can also be applied to super-resolution direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). dSTORM utilizes conventional dyes and starts with samples in a fluorescent ON state. This helps identifying structures of interests. Subsequently, labelled samples are brought to blinking, which is necessary for localization of single molecules and reconstruction of super-resolution images. This is only possible with certain fluorescent dyes and imaging buffers. One of the most widely used dyes for dSTORM, Alexa Fluor (AF) 647, blinks in Vectashield. However, after adding Vectashield to our samples, we noticed that the fluorescence intensity of AF647 and its improved variant, AF647+, is quenched. Since structures of interest cannot be identified in quenched samples, loss of fluorescence intensity hinders imaging of AF647 in Vectashield. This has consequences for both conventional and dSTORM imaging. To overcome this, we provide: 1) a quantitative analysis of AF647 intensity in different imaging media, 2) practical advice on how to use Vectashield for dSTORM imaging of AF647 and AF647+.",

    "abstract": "To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define molecular alterations within (and between) disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell states. We note that disease-associated perturbations usually retain cellular-identity programs (core genes), providing an appropriate reference for secondary comparison analyses. Thus, we created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis and classification of cell types from diverse scRNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony is an automated and easy-to-use tool that efficiently matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community clustering and alignment strategy. Utilizing core genes and community clustering to reveal disease and cell-state systems-level insights overcomes bias toward donor and disease effects that can be imposed by joint-alignment approaches. Moreover, cellHarmony directly compares cell frequencies and gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner, then produces a holistic representation of these differences across potentially dozens of cell populations and impacted regulatory networks. Using this approach, we identify gene regulatory programs that are selectively impacted in distinct hematopoietic and heart cell populations that suggest novel disease mechanisms and drug targets. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Asynchrony is a critical cue informing the brain whether sensory signals are caused by a common source and should be integrated or segregated. It is unclear how the brain binds audiotactile signals into behavioural benefits depending on their asynchrony. Participants actively responded (psychophysics) or passively attended (electroencephalogrpahy) to noise bursts,  taps-to-the-face, and their audiotactile (AT) combinations at seven audiotactile asynchronies: 0, {+/-}20, {+/-}70, and {+/-}500ms. Observers were faster at detecting AT than unisensory stimuli, maximally for synchronous stimulation and declining within a [&le;]70ms temporal integration window. We observed AT interactions for (1) near-synchronous stimuli within a [&le;]20ms temporal integration window for evoked response potentials (ERPs) at 110ms and [~]400ms, (2) specifically {+/-}70ms asynchronies, across the P200 ERP and theta-band inter-trial coherence (ITC) and power at [~]200ms, with a frontocentral topography, and (3) beta-band power across several asynchronies. Our results suggest that early AT interactions for ERP and theta-band ITC and power mediate behavioural response facilitation within a [&le;]70ms temporal integration window, but beta-band power reflects AT interactions that are less relevant for behaviour. This diversity of temporal profiles and constraints demonstrates how audiotactile integration unfolds in a cascade of interactions to generate behavioural benefits.",

    "abstract": "Decisions are often made by accumulating ambiguous evidence over time. The brains arousal systems are activated during such decisions. In previous work in humans, we showed that evoked responses of arousal centers during decisions are reported by rapid dilations of the pupil, and predict a suppression of biases in the accumulation of decision-relevant evidence (de Gee et al. 2017). Here, we show that this arousal-related suppression in decision bias acts on both conservative and liberal biases, and generalizes across species (humans / mice), sensory systems (visual / auditory), and domains of decision-making (perceptual / memory-based). In challenging sound-detection tasks, the impact of spontaneous or experimentally induced choice biases was reduced under high arousal. Similar bias suppression occurred when evidence was drawn from memory. All these behavioral effects were explained by reduced evidence accumulation biases. Our results pinpoint a general principle of the interplay between phasic arousal and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Stable cooperation requires plasticity whereby individuals are able to express competitive or cooperative behaviors depending on social context. To date, however, the physiological mechanisms that underlie behavioral variation in cooperative systems are poorly understood. We studied hormone-mediated behavior in the wire-tailed manakin (Pipra filicauda), a gregarious songbird whose cooperative partnerships are crucial for fitness. We used automated telemetry to monitor > 36,000 cooperative interactions among male manakins over three field seasons, and we examined how circulating testosterone affects cooperation using > 500 hormone samples. Observational data show that in non-territorial floater males, high testosterone is associated with increased cooperative behaviors and subsequent ascension to territorial status. In territory-holding males, however, both observational and experimental evidence demonstrate that high testosterone antagonizes cooperation. Moreover, circulating testosterone explains significant variation (2-8%) in social behavior within each status class. Collectively, our findings show that the hormonal control of cooperation depends on a males social status. We propose that the status-dependent reorganization of hormone-regulatory pathways can facilitate stable cooperative partnerships, and thus provide direct fitness benefits for males.",

    "abstract": "Animal walking results from a complex interplay of central pattern generating networks (CPGs), local sensory signals expressing position, velocity and forces generated in the legs, and coordinating signals between neighboring ones. In the stick insect, in particular, intra- and intersegmental coordination is conveyed by these sensory signals. The rhythmic activity of the CPGs, hence of the legs, can be modified by the aforementioned sensory signals. However, the precise nature of the interaction between the CPGs and these sensory signals has remained largely unknown. Experimental methods aiming at finding out details of these interactions, often apply the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, pilocarpine in order to induce rhythmic activity in the CPGs, hence in the motoneurons of the segmental ganglia. Using this general approach, we removed the influence of sensory signals and investigated the putative connections between CPGs associated with the coxa-trochanter (CTr)-joint in the different segments (legs) in more detail. The experimental data underwent phase-difference analysis and Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). These methods can uncover the underlying coupling structure and strength between pairs of segmental ganglia (CPGs). We set up different coupling schemes (models) for DCM and compared them using Bayesian Model Selection (BMS). Models with contralateral connections in each segment and ipsilateral connections on both sides, as well as the coupling from the meta- to the ipsilateral prothoracic ganglion were preferred by BMS to all other types of models tested. Moreover, the intrasegmental coupling strength in the mesothoracic ganglion was the strongest and most stable in all three ganglia.",

    "abstract": "N-cadherin adhesion has been reported to enhance cancer and neuronal cell migration either by mediating actomyosin-based force transduction or initiating Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR)-dependent biochemical signalling. Here we show that FGFR1 reduces N-cadherin-mediated cell migration. Both proteins are co-stabilised at cell-cell contacts through direct interaction. As a consequence, cell adhesion is strengthened, limiting the migration of cells on N-cadherin. Both the inhibition of migration and the stabilisation of cell adhesions require the FGFR activity stimulated by N-cadherin engagement. FGFR1 stabilises N-cadherin at the cell membrane through a pathway involving Src and p120. Moreover, FGFR1 stimulates the anchoring of N-cadherin to actin. We found that the migratory behaviour of cells depends on an optimum balance between FGFR-regulated N-cadherin adhesion and actin dynamics. Based on these findings we propose a positive feedback loop between N-cadherin and FGFR at adhesion sites limiting N-cadherin-based single cell migration.",

We used Mendelian randomization, which can be more robust to confounding by indication and patient characteristics, to investigate the effects of lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP), via different antihypertensive drug classes, on Alzheimers disease.\\n\\nMethodsWe used summary statistics from genome wide association studies of SBP (from UK Biobank) and Alzheimers disease (from the International Genomics of Alzheimers Project) in a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mimic the action of antihypertensive targets and estimated the effect of lowering SBP, via antihypertensive drug classes, on Alzheimers disease. We also report the effect of lowering SBP on Alzheimers disease by combining all drug targets and without consideration of the associated drugs.\\n\\nResultsThere was limited evidence that lowering SBP, via antihypertensive drug classes, affected Alzheimers disease risk.

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication, and in mammals are generally classified as ~50-150nm exosomes, ~100-1000nm microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, each arising as a result of different biological processes. EVs carry protein, lipids, and nucleic acids within the circulation, to target cells whereupon they mediate physiological changes. Due to their small size, quantification and characterization by conventional microscopy is not possible. However, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) has provided a method to determine the fluid concentration and size of extracellular vesicles and other nanoparticles. While NTA provides statistical summaries of samples in an experiment, a recurring difficulty is the organization, manipulation, and management of raw particle count data because of the large size of datasets, and resultant vulnerability to user error. To address these limitations, we developed tidyNano, an R package that provides functions to import, clean, and quickly summarize raw NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical) data for efficient calculation of statistics and visualization. Here, we provide a framework for importing raw nanoparticle data and provide functions to facilitate rapid and efficient analysis, visualization and calculation of summary statistics. tidyNano was used to analyze murine plasma extracellular vesicles across gestation by aggregating and summarizing samples based on technical, biological and gestational parameters. In addition, we developed shinySIGHT, a Shiny web application that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of EV data. Using this package, we analyzed data generated from 36 samples of EV derived from the plasma of mice across gestation.\\n\\nPeripheral EV concentration increased linearly across pregnancy, with trending increases as early as gestation day (GD) 5.5 and significant rises at GD14.5, and 17.5 relative to EV concentrations in nonpregnant females. Thus, the data highlight the utility of the mouse as a model of EV biology in pregnancy. Further, the package provides a mechanism for seamless analysis of EV data generated by NanoSight. Importantly, this package provides a straightforward framework by which diverse types of large datasets can be simply and efficiently analyzed. tidyNano and shinySIGHT are freely available under the MIT license and is hosted on GitHub (https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/).",

    "abstract": "Simulations of close relatives and identical by descent (IBD) segments are common in genetic studies, yet most past efforts have utilized sex averaged genetic maps and ignored crossover interference, thus omitting features known to affect the breakpoints of IBD segments. We developed Ped-sim, a method for simulating relatives that can utilize either sex-specific or sex averaged genetic maps and also either a model of crossover interference or the traditional Poisson model for inter-crossover distances. To characterize the impact of previously ignored mechanisms, we simulated data for all four combinations of these factors. We found that modeling crossover interference decreases the standard deviation of the IBD proportion by 10.4% on average in full siblings through second cousins. By contrast, sex-specific maps increase this standard deviation by 4.2% on average, and also impact the number of segments relatives share. Most notably, using sex-specific maps, the number of segments half-siblings share is bimodal; and when combined with interference modeling, the probability that sixth cousins have non-zero IBD ranges from 9.0 to 13.1%, depending on the sexes of the individuals through which they are related. We present new analytical results for the distributions of IBD segments under these models and show they match results from simulations. Finally, we compared IBD sharing rates between simulated and real relatives and find that the combination of sex-specific maps and interference modeling most accurately captures IBD rates in real data. Ped-sim is open source and available from https://github.com/williamslab/ped-sim.\\n\\nAuthor summarySimulations are ubiquitous throughout statistical genetics in order to generate data with known properties, enabling tests of inference methods and analyses of real world processes in settings where experimental data are challenging to collect. Simulating genetic data for relatives in a pedigree requires the synthesis of chromosomes parents transmit to their children. These chromosomes form as a mosaic of a given parents two chromosomes, with the location of switches between the two parental chromosomes known as crossovers. Detailed information about crossover generation based on real data from humans now exists, including the fact that men and women have overall different rates (women produce ~1.6 times more crossovers) and that real crossovers are subject to interference--whereby crossovers are further apart from one another than expected under a model that selects their locations randomly. Our new method, Ped-sim, can simulate pedigree data using these less commonly modeled crossover features, and we used it to evaluate the importance of sex-specific rates and interference in real data. These comparisons show that both factors shape the amount of DNA two relatives share identically, and that their inclusion in models of crossover better fit data from real relatives.",

    "abstract": "Automated monitoring of fertility in dairy cows using milk progesterone is based on the accurate and timely identification of luteolysis. In this way, well-adapted insemination advice can be provided to the farmer to further optimize the fertility management. To properly evaluate and compare the performance of new and existing data-processing algorithms, a test dataset of progesterone time-series that fully covers the desired variability in progesterone profiles is needed. Further, the data should be measured with a high frequency to allow rapid onset events, such as luteolysis, to be precisely determined. Collecting this type of data would require a lot of time, effort and budget. In the absence of such data, an alternative was developed using simulated progesterone profiles for multiple cows and lactations, in which the different fertility statuses were represented. To these, relevant variability in terms of cycle characteristics and measurement error was added, resulting in a large cost-efficient dataset of well-controlled but highly variable and farm-representative profiles. Besides the progesterone profiles, information on (the timing of) luteolysis was extracted from the modelling approach and used as a reference for the evaluation and comparison of the algorithms. In this study, two progesterone monitoring tools were compared: a multiprocess Kalman filter combined with a fixed threshold on the smoothed progesterone values to detect luteolysis, and a progesterone monitoring algorithm using synergistic control  PMASC, which uses a mathematical model based on the luteal dynamics and a statistical control chart to detect luteolysis. The timing of the alerts and the robustness against missing values of both algorithms were investigated using two different sampling schemes: one sample per cow every eight hours versus one sample per day. The alerts for luteolysis of the PMASC algorithm were on average 20 hours earlier compared to the ones of the multiprocess Kalman filter, and their timing was less sensitive to missing values. This was shown by the fact that, when one sample per day was used, the Kalman filter gave its alerts on average 24 hours later, and the variability in timing of the alerts compared to simulated luteolysis increased with 22%. Accordingly, we postulate that implementation of the PMASC system could improve the consistency of luteolysis detection on farm and lower the analysis costs compared to the current state of the art.\\n\\nInterpretative SummaryValidation of luteolysis monitoring tool for dairy cows.\\n\\nAdriaensIn this study, the performance of two monitoring algorithms to detect luteolysis using milk progesterone measurements was validated on a simulated dataset of realistic milk progesterone profiles. The synergistic control-based algorithm, PMASC, was able to identify luteolysis almost simultaneously with its occurrence. It was found to be more robust against missing samples and less dependent on the absolute milk progesterone values compared to a multiprocess Kalman filter combined with a fixed threshold. This research showed that implementation of PMASC could improve progesterone-based fertility monitoring on farm.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we present G4-iM Grinder as a system for potential G4, i-Motif and higher-order structure identification and characterization. Several grading tools of biological relevance and G4 in vitro formation probability are included in this highly modulable and robust engine. G4-iM Grinder improves other current quadruplex search engines when compared in capabilities and processing time. We used G4-iM Grinder in the analysis of the complete human genome whilst focusing on frequency and score of G-based structures. We studied the most recurrent potential quadruplex sequences (PQS) and the longest highest scoring potential higher order quadruplex sequences (PHOQS) in our genome. As proof of the analytical capabilities of G4-iM Grinder, we also analysed a new PHOQS and predicted the most probable PQS subunits to form it. Taking the human average PQS density as reference, we examined the genomes of organisms that cause leishmaniosis, diphtheria, brucellosis, meningitis, pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, leprosy, AIDS, dengue fever and hepatitis C, and found they are very rich in PQS. G4-iM Grinder identified within many of these organisms several already known-to-form G4 sequences. Together, this suggests that G4-quadruplexes may potentially be important therapeutic targets against many of these organisms that currently kill millions worldwide.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=160 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532382v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (61K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b01c08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@56b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c1a63org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e88e04_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the RNA-binding protein FUS cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of motor neurons induces progressive weakness and death from respiratory failure, typically only 3-5 years after onset. FUS plays a role in numerous aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA splicing. However, the impact of ALS-causative mutations on splicing has not been fully characterised, as most disease models have been based on FUS overexpression, which in itself alters its RNA processing functions. To overcome this, we and others have recently created knock-in models, and have generated high depth RNA-sequencing data on FUS mutants in parallel to FUS knockout. We combined three independent datasets with a joint modelling approach, allowing us to compare the mutation-induced changes to genuine loss of function. We find that FUS ALS-mutations induce a widespread loss of function on expression and splicing, with a preferential effect on RNA binding proteins. Mutant FUS induces intron retention changes through RNA binding, and we identify an intron retention event in FUS itself that is associated with its autoregulation. Altered FUS regulation has been linked to disease, and intriguingly, we find FUS autoregulation to be altered not only by FUS mutations, but also in other genetic forms of ALS, including those caused by TDP-43, VCP and SOD1 mutations, supporting the concept that multiple ALS genes interact in a regulatory network.",

We introduce scSplit which utilises genetic differences inferred from scRNA-Seq data alone to demultiplex pooled samples. scSplit also extracts a minimal set of high confidence presence/absence genotypes in each cluster which can be used to map clusters to original samples. Using a range of simulated, merged individual-sample as well as pooled multi-individual scRNA-Seq datasets, we show that scSplit is highly accurate and concordant with demuxlet predictions. Furthermore, scSplit predictions are highly consistent with the known truth in cell-hashing dataset. We also show that multiplexed-scRNA-Seq can be used to reduce batch effects caused by technical biases. scSplit is ideally suited to samples for which external genome-wide genotype data cannot be obtained (for example non-model organisms), or for which it is impossible to obtain unmixed samples directly, such as mixtures of genetically distinct tumour cells, or mixed infections. scSplit is available at: https://github.com/jon-xu/scSplit",

A major limitation of Hi-C is the sequencing depth required to robustly detect loops in the data. A popular approach used to mitigate this issue, even in single-cell Hi-C data, is genome-wide averaging (piling-up) of peaks, or other features, annotated in high-resolution datasets, to measure their prominence in less deeply sequenced data. However current tools do not provide a computationally efficient and versatile implementation of this approach.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe coolpup.py - a versatile tool to perform pile-up analysis on Hi-C data.

We also present a novel variation of the pile-up approach that can aid the in statistical analysis of looping interactions. We anticipate that coolpup.py will aid in Hi-C data analysis by allowing easy to use, versatile and efficient generation of pileups.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationCoolpup.py is cross-platform, open-source and free (MIT licensed) software.

    "abstract": "Cardiac regeneration and stem cell therapies depend critically on the ability to locally resolve the contractile properties of heart tissue1,2. Current regeneration approaches explore the growth of cardiac tissue in vitro and the injection of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes3-6 (CMs) but scientists struggle with low engraftment rates and marginal mechanical improvements, leaving the estimated 26 million patients suffering from heart failure worldwide without effective therapy7-9. One impediment to further progress is the limited ability to functionally monitor injected cells as currently available techniques and probes lack speed and sensitivity as well as single cell specificity. Here, we introduce microscopic whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasers into beating cardiomyocytes to realize all-optical recording of transient cardiac contraction profiles with cellular resolution. The brilliant emission and high spectral sensitivity of microlasers to local changes in refractive index enable long-term tracking of individual cardiac cells, monitoring of drug administration, and accurate measurements of organ scale contractility in live zebrafish. Our study reveals changes in sarcomeric protein density as underlying factor to cardiac contraction which is of fundamental importance for understanding the mechano-biology of cardiac muscle activation. The ability to non-invasively assess functional properties of transplanted cells and engineered cardiac tissue will stimulate the development of novel translational approaches and the in vivo monitoring of physiological parameters more broadly. Likewise, the use of implanted microlasers as cardiac sensors is poised to inspire the adaptation of the most advanced optical tools known to the microresonator community, like quantum-enhanced single-molecule biosensing or frequency comb spectroscopy10.",

    "abstract": "Microglia have classically been viewed as the endogenous phagocytes of the brain, however, emerging evidence suggests roles for microglia in the healthy, mature nervous system. We know little of the contribution microglia make to ongoing processing in sensory systems. To explore Iba1+ microglial diversity, we employed the inferior colliculi (IC) as model nuclei, as they are characterized by sub-regions specialized for differing aspects of auditory processing. We conducted fluorescent multi-channel immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy in guinea pigs of both sexes and discovered that the density and morphology of Iba1+ labelling varied between parenchymal sub-regions of IC, while GFAP+ labelling of astrocytes was confined to the glia limitans externa and peri-vascular regions. The density of Iba1+ microglia somata was similar across sub-regions, however a greater amount of labelling was found in dorsal cortex than ventral central nucleus or lateral cortex. To further understand these differences between sub-regions in IC, Sholl and skeleton analyses of individual microglia revealed a greater number of branching ramifications in dorsal cortex. We also quantified abutments of Iba1+ microglial processes onto GAD67+ (putative GABAergic) somata. Cluster analyses revealed two novel sub-types of GAD67+ neuron, which can be distinguished solely based on the quantity of axo-somatic Iba1+ abutments they receive. These data demonstrate Iba1+ microglia exhibit different morphologies and interactions with GAD67+ neurons in distinct sub-regions of the mature, healthy IC. Taken together, these findings suggest significant heterogeneity amongst microglia in the auditory system, possibly related to the ongoing functional demands of their niche.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenesis rewires signaling networks to confer a fitness advantage to malignant cells. For instance, the B16F0 melanoma cell model creates a cytokine sink for Interleukin-12 (IL-12) to deprive neighboring cells of this important anti-tumor immune signal. While a cytokine sink provides an indirect fitness advantage, does IL-12 provide an intrinsic advantage to B16F0 cells? Functionally, stimulation with IL-12 enhanced B16F0 cell survival but not normal Melan-A melanocytes that were challenged with a cytotoxic agent. To identify a mechanism, we assayed the phosphorylation of proteins involved in canonical IL-12 signaling, STAT4, and cell survival, Akt. In contrast to T cells that exhibited a canonical response to IL-12 by phosphorylating STAT4, IL-12 stimulation of B16F0 cells predominantly phosphorylated Akt. Mechanistically, the differential response in B16F0 cells is explained by both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent aspects to initiate PI3K-AKT signaling upon IL12RB2 homodimerization. Namely, IL-12 promotes IL12RB2 homodimerization with low affinity and IL12RB2 overexpression promotes homodimerization via molecular crowding on the plasma membrane. Collectively, the data suggest that B16F0 cells shifted the intra-cellular response to IL-12 from engaging immune surveillance to favoring cell survival. Identifying how signaling networks are rewired in model systems of spontaneous origin can inspire therapeutic strategies in humans.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWhile Interleukin-12 is a key cytokine that promotes anti-tumor immunity, thinking of cancer as an evolutionary process implies that an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment could arise during oncogenesis by interfering with endogenous anti-tumor immune signals, like IL-12. Previously, we found that B16F0 cells, a cell line derived from a spontaneous melanoma, interrupts this heterocellular signal by sequestering IL-12, which provides an indirect fitness advantage. Here, we report that B16F0 cells gain an intrinsic advantage by rewiring the canonical response to IL-12 to instead initiate PI3K-AKT signaling, which promotes cell survival. The data suggest a model where overexpressing one component of the IL-12 receptor, IL12RB2, enables melanoma cells to shift the functional response via both IL-12-mediated and molecular crowding-based IL12RB2 homodimerization.",

While the ecological and evolutionary significance of parental behaviour is well recognized, underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We took advantage of behavioural diversity across closely related species of South American poison frogs (Family Dendrobatidae) to identify neural correlates of parental behaviour shared across sexes and species. We characterized differences in neural induction, gene expression in active neurons, and activity of specific neuronal types in three species with distinct parental care patterns: male uniparental, female uniparental, and biparental. We identified the medial pallium and preoptic area as core brain regions associated with parental care, independent of sex and species. Identification of neurons active during parental care confirms a role for neuropeptides associated with care in other vertebrates as well as identifying novel candidates. Our work is the first to explore neural and molecular mechanisms of parental care in amphibians and highlights the potential for mechanistic studies in closely related but behaviourally variable species to build a more complete understanding of how shared principles and species-specific diversity govern parental care and other social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWQuantitative traits analyzed in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are often non-normally distributed. For such traits, association tests based on standard linear regression are subject to reduced power and inflated type I error in finite samples. Applying the rank-based Inverse Normal Transformation (INT) to non-normally distributed traits has become common practice in GWAS. However, the different variations on INT-based association testing have not been formally defined, and guidance is lacking on when to use which approach. In this paper, we formally define and systematically compare the direct (D-INT) and indirect (I-INT) INT-based association tests. We discuss their assumptions, underlying generative models, and connections. We demonstrate that the relative powers of D-INT and I-INT depend on the underlying data generating process. Since neither approach is uniformly most powerful, we combine them into an adaptive omnibus test (O-INT). O-INT is robust to model misspecification, protects the type I error, and is well powered against a wide range of non-normally distributed traits. Extensive simulations were conducted to examine the finite sample operating characteristics of these tests. Our results demonstrate that, for non-normally distributed traits, INT-based tests outperform the standard untransformed association test (UAT), both in terms of power and type I error rate control. We apply the proposed methods to GWAS of spirometry traits in the UK Biobank. O-INT has been implemented in the R package RNOmni, which is available on CRAN.",

    "abstract": "Development of fatty acid synthesis pathway (FASII) inhibitors against the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus hinges on the accepted but unproven postulate that an endogenously synthesized branched chain fatty acid is required to complete membrane phospholipids. Evidence for anti-FASII efficacy in animal models supported this view. However, restricted test conditions used previously to show FASII antibiotic efficacy led us to investigate these questions in a broader, host-relevant context. We report that S. aureus rapidly adapts to FASII antibiotics without FASII mutations when exposed to host environments. Treatment with a lead FASII antibiotic upon signs of infection, rather than just after inoculation as commonly practiced, failed to eliminate S. aureus from infected organs in a septicemia model. In vitro, addition of serum facilitated rapid S. aureus FASII bypass by environmental fatty acid (eFA) replacement in phospholipids. Serum lowers membrane stress, leading to increased retention of the two substrates required for exogenous fatty acid (eFA) utilization. In these conditions, eFA occupy both phospholipid positions 1 and 2, regardless of anti-FASII selection. This study revises conclusions on S. aureus fatty acid requirements by disproving the postulate of fatty acid stringency, and reveals an Achilles heel for using FASII antibiotics to treat infection in monotherapy.\\n\\nSignificance statementAntibiotic discovery to overcome treatment failure has huge socio-medical and economic stakes. The fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway is considered an ideal druggable target against the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, based on evidence of anti-FASII efficacy in infection models, and the postulate that S. aureus synthesizes an irreplaceable fatty acid. We report that S. aureus alters its behavior in host-relevant conditions. Administering FASII antibiotics upon signs of infection, rather than just after inoculation as frequently practiced, failed to clear septicemic infections. In serum, S. aureus rapidly overcomes FASII antibiotics by incorporating alternative fatty acids.

    "abstract": "In free-living bacteria and archaea, the equivalent of the biological species concept does not exist, creating several barriers to the study of the processes contributing to microbial diversification. As such, microorganisms are often operationally defined using conserved marker genes (i.e., 16S rRNA gene) or whole-genome measurements (i.e., ANI) to interpret intra-specific processes. However, as in eukaryotes, investigations into microbial populations must consider the potential for interacting genotypes among individuals that are subjected to similar environmental selective pressures. Therefore, we isolated 26 strains within a single bacterial ecotype (equivalent to a eukaryotic species definition) from a common habitat (leaf litter) across a regional climate gradient and asked whether the genetic diversity in a free-living soil bacterium (Curtobacterium) was consistent with patterns of allopatric or sympatric differentiation. By examining patterns of gene flow, our results indicate that microbial populations are delineated by gene flow discontinuities and exhibit evidence for population-specific adaptation. We conclude that the genetic structure within this bacterium is due to both adaptation within localized microenvironments (isolation-by-environment) as well as dispersal limitation between geographic locations (isolation-by-distance).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal and incurable brain cancer with a dismal prognosis. In order to impact on this disease, we need to understand how infiltrating, non resectable tumour cells resist chemoradiation and facilitate disease recurrence. To this end, we generated or acquired bulk tumour RNA sequencing data from 45 paired primary and locally recurrent GBM tumours (split into original and validation cohorts) from patients that received standard treatment. We also generated DNA methylation profiles for 9 pairs and sequenced RNA from single cells isolated from a patient derived GBM spheroid model at different timepoints following in vitro chemoradiation.\\n\\nResultsWe have identified a set of genes with Jumonji and AT-Rich Interacting Domain 2 (JARID2) binding sites in their promoters that are universally dysregulated in post-standard treatment recurrent GBMs compared to the primary tumour. The direction of dysregulation is patient-dependent and not associated with differential promoter DNA methylation. Our in vitro experiments suggest that this dysregulation occurs dynamically following treatment as opposed to resulting from selection of cells with specific expression profiles.\\n\\nConclusionJARID2 is an accessory protein to a chromatin remodeling complex, responsible for histone modifications observed during cell state transitions in both normal brain and GBM. We propose that JARID2 facilitates GBM recurrence following treatment by indirect transcriptional reprogramming of surviving cells in whichever manner is needed to reproduce the phenotypic heterogeneity required for tumour regrowth in vivo. The mechanism of this reprogramming may present a therapeutic vulnerability for more effective treatment of GBM.",

This study addressed both limitations using the largest panel of HPV+ HNSCC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids described to date. Whole exome profiles of the PDXs were compared to those of HPV+ human tumors and cell lines, and genetic features of the models were analyzed relative to their growth properties and outcomes of their patients of origin. PDX engraftment enriched for negatively prognostic NOTCH1 mutations while preserving multiple features lost in existing cell lines, including PIK3CA mutations, TRAF3 deletion, and absence of EGFR amplification. Observation of more mutations in faster-growing models facilitated identification of an association between mutational burden and local progression in both HPV+ and HPV-HNSCCs. Reduced E7 and p16INK4A levels found in a PDX from a lethal case led to detection of a similar profile among recurrent HPV+ HNSCCs in two patient cohorts, where low E2F target gene expression downstream of E7 predicted recurrence and mortality.

    "abstract": "The avocado, Persea americana, is a fruit crop of immense importance to Mexican agriculture with an increasing demand worldwide. Avocado lies in the anciently-diverged magnoliid clade of angiosperms, which has a controversial phylogenetic position relative to eudicots and monocots. We sequenced the nuclear genomes of the Mexican avocado race, P. americana var. drymifolia, and the most commercially popular hybrid cultivar, Hass, and anchored the latter to chromosomes using a genetic map. Resequencing of Guatemalan and West Indian varieties revealed that [~]39% of the Hass genome represents Guatemalan source regions introgressed into a Mexican race background. Some introgressed blocks are extremely large, consistent with the recent origin of the cultivar. The avocado lineage experienced two lineage-specific polyploidy events during its evolutionary history. Although gene-tree/species-tree phylogenomic results are inconclusive, syntenic ortholog distances to other species place avocado as sister to the enormous monocot and eudicot lineages combined. Duplicate genes descending from polyploidy augmented the transcription factor diversity of avocado, while tandem duplicates enhanced the secondary metabolism of the species. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, known to be elicited by Colletotrichum (anthracnose) pathogen infection in avocado, is one enriched function among tandems. Furthermore, transcriptome data show that tandem duplicates are significantly up- and down-regulated in response to anthracnose infection, whereas polyploid duplicates are not, supporting the general view that collections of tandem duplicates contribute evolutionarily recent \\\"tuning knobs\\\" in the genome adaptive landscapes of given species.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAvocado is a nutritious, economically important fruit species that occupies an unresolved position near the earliest evolutionary branchings of flowering plants. Our nuclear genome sequences of Mexican and Hass variety avocados inform ancient evolutionary relationships and genome doublings, the admixed nature of Hass, and provide a look at how pathogen interactions have shaped avocados more recent genomic evolutionary history.",

We show that while PCA performed on raw data is biased towards highly expressed genes, this bias can be mitigated with a cell aggregation step, allowing the recovery of denoised expression values for both highly and lowly expressed genes. We benchmark our resulting ENHANCE algorithm and three previously described methods on simulated data that closely mimic real datasets, showing that ENHANCE provides the best overall denoising accuracy, recovering modules of co-expressed genes and cell subpopulations.

    "abstract": "The inherent noise of neural systems makes it difficult to construct models which accurately capture experimental measurements of their activity. While much research has been done on how to efficiently model neural activity with descriptive models such as linear-nonlinear-models (LN), Bayesian inference for mechanistic models has received considerably less attention. One reason for this is that these models typically lead to intractable likelihoods and thus make parameter inference difficult. Here, we develop an approximate Bayesian inference scheme for a fully stochastic, biophysically inspired model of glutamate release at the ribbon synapse, a highly specialized synapse found in different sensory systems. The model translates known structural features of the ribbon synapse into a set of stochastically coupled equations. We approximate the posterior distributions by updating a parametric prior distribution via Bayesian updating rules and show that model parameters can be efficiently estimated for synthetic and experimental data from in vivo two-photon experiments in the zebrafish retina. Also, we find that the model captures complex properties of the synaptic release such as the temporal precision and outperforms a standard GLM. Our framework provides a viable path forward for linking mechanistic models of neural activity to measured data.",

In this paper, we provide an alternative view of this classic problem that does not depend on exploring to optimize for reward.

Through theory and simulations we prove that explore-exploit problems based on this can be solved by a simple rule that yields optimal solutions: when information is more valuable than rewards, be curious, otherwise seek rewards. We show that this rule performs well and robustly under naturalistic constraints. We suggest three criteria can be used to distinguish our approach from other theories.",

    "abstract": "O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification involving O-linkage of {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine to Ser/Thr residues on target proteins, is increasingly recognized as a critical regulator of brain function in health and disease. Enzymes that catalyze O-GlcNAcylation are found at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites, and O-GlcNAcylated proteins localize to synaptosomes. An acute increase in O-GlcNAcylation induces long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory transmission at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, and depresses hyperexcitable circuits in vitro and in vivo. Yet, no study has investigated how O-GlcNAcylation modulates the efficacy of inhibitory neurotransmission. Here we show an acute increase in O-GlcNAc dampens GABAergic currents onto principal cells in rodent hippocampus likely through a postsynaptic mechanism, and has a variable effect on the excitation/inhibition balance. The overall effect of increased O-GlcNAc is reduced synaptically-driven spike probability via synaptic depression and decreased intrinsic excitability. Our results position O-GlcNAcylation as a novel regulator of the overall excitation/inhibition balance and neuronal output.",

However, all platforms proposed so far suffer from high cost, read-write latency and error-rates that render them noncompetitive with modern optical and magnetic storage devices. One means to avoid synthesizing DNA and to reduce the system error-rates is to use readily available native DNA. As the symbol/nucleotide content of native DNA is fixed, one may adopt an alternative recording strategy that modifies the DNA topology to encode desired information. Here, we report the first macromolecular storage paradigm in which data is written in the form of \"nicks (punches)\" at predetermined positions on the sugar-phosphate backbone of native dsDNA. The platform accommodates parallel nicking on multiple \"orthogonal\" genomic DNA fragments and paired nicking and disassociation for creating \"toehold\" regions that enable single-bit random access and strand displacement in-memory computations. As a proof of concept, we used the programmable restriction enzyme Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute to punch two files into the PCR products of Escherichia coli genomic DNA.

    "abstract": "BackgroundReward associations during auditory learning induce cortical plasticity in the primary auditory cortex. A prominent source of such influence is the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which conveys a dopaminergic teaching signal to the primary auditory cortex. It is currently unknown, however, how the VTA circuitry thereby influences cortical frequency information processing and spectral integration. In this study, we therefore investigated the temporal effects of direct optogenetic stimulation of the VTA onto spectral integration in the auditory cortex on a synaptic circuit level by current-source-density analysis in anesthetized Mongolian gerbils.\\n\\nResultsWhile auditory lemniscal input predominantly terminates in the granular input layers III/IV, we found that VTA-mediated modulation of spectral processing is relayed by a different circuit, namely enhanced thalamic inputs to the infragranular layers Vb/VIa. Activation of this circuit yields a frequency-specific gain amplification of local sensory input and enhances corticocortical information transfer, especially in supragranular layers I/II. This effects further persisted over more than 30 minutes after VTA stimulation.\\n\\nConclusionsAltogether, we demonstrate that the VTA exhibits a long-lasting influence on sensory cortical processing via infragranular layers transcending the signaling of a mere reward-prediction error. Our findings thereby demonstrate a cellular and circuit substrate for the influence of reinforcement-evaluating brain systems on sensory processing in the auditory cortex.",

However, there are certain phenomena that the Fisher-KPP model cannot replicate, such as the extinction of invasive populations.

In this study, untargeted metabolic profiling of hot water extract of fresh and air dried leaves of O. basilicum, O. sanctum and O. kilimandscharicum species employing gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was attempted. Analysis of hot water extracts of Ocimum leaves will provide details of molecules consumed and species specific differences, if any. Several metabolic features including amino acids (glycine, serine glutamate), organic and other acids (succinic acid, fumaric acid, 4-amino butanoic acid), sugars and their derivatives (glucose, sucrose, mannitol, fructose) and secondary metabolites (shikimic acid, quinic acid, catechol, gamma amino butyric acid, eugenol) were identified. Multivariate statistical analysis of GC-MS data indicated several species specific metabolic similarities and differences. Based on variable importance parameter score of >1, it was observed that in case of air dried extracts, glucose, fumaric acid, and D-mannitol displayed as important variables for species specific variation. Whereas in case of fresh leaves extracts, the variation was prominent due to xylose, D-allose and an unknown metabolic feature detected at 24 min (metabolite@24 with highest m/z 75). Phytochemical phenotype of Ocimum leaves not only shows species specific variations but these may partly explain their difference in taste and health benefits from their use as hot beverages.",

The clinical disease is characterized by 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, dilated cardiomyopathy, abnormal neurological development and other heterogeneous features. Until recently no effective therapies had been identified and affected patients frequently died in early childhood from intractable heart failure.\\n\\nMethodsDermal fibroblasts from four pediatric patients with DCMA were used to establish parameters of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial structure, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cardiolipin composition and gene expression were evaluated.\\n\\nResultsImmunocytochemistry with semi-automated quantification of mitochondrial structural metrics and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated mitochondria to be highly fragmented in DCMA fibroblasts compared to healthy control cells. Live-cell imaging demonstrated significantly increased ROS production in patient cells. These structural and functional abnormalities were reversed by treating DCMA fibroblasts with SS-31, a synthetic peptide that localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Levels of cardiolipin were not significantly different between control and DCMA cells and were unaffected by SS-31 treatment.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate the abnormal mitochondrial structure and function in fibroblasts from patients with DCMA and suggest that SS-31 may represent a potential therapy for this devastating disease.",

    "abstract": "Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a ubiquitous precursor of polycarbonate plastics that is found in the blood and serum of >92% of Americans. While BPA has been well documented to act as a weak estrogen receptor (ER) agonist, its effects on cellular stress are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that high-dose BPA causes stress granules (SGs) in human cells. A common estrogen derivative, {beta}-estradiol, does not trigger SGs, indicating the mechanism of SG induction is not via the ER pathway. We also tested other structurally related environmental contaminants including the common BPA substitutes BPS and BPF, the industrial chemical 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) and structurally related compounds 4-EP and 4-VP, and the pesticide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The variable results from these related compounds suggest that structural homology is not a reliable predictor of the capacity of a compound to cause SGs. Also, we demonstrate that BPA acts primarily through the PERK pathway to generate canonical SGs. Finally, we show that chronic exposure to a low physiologically relevant dose of BPA disrupts SG assembly by inhibiting SGs upon additional acute stress. Our work identifies additional effects of BPA beyond endocrine disruption that may have consequences for human health.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of microbes degrading recalcitrant materials has been extensively explored from environmental remediation to industrial applications. Although significant achievements were obtained with single strains, focus is now going toward the use of microbial consortia because of advantages in terms of functional stability and efficiency. While consortia assembly attempts were made from several known single strains, another approach consists in obtaining consortia from complex environmental microbial communities in search for novel microbial species, genes and functions. However, assembling efficient microbial consortia from complex environmental communities is far from trivial due to large diversity and biotic interactions at play. Here we propose a strategy containing enrichment and dilution-to-extinction cultures to construct simplified microbial consortia (SMC) for keratinous waste management, from complex environmental communities. Gradual dilutions were performed from a keratinolytic microbial consortium, and dilution 10-9 was selected to construct a SMC library. Further compositional analysis and keratinolytic activity assays demonstrated that microbial consortia were successfully simplified, without impacting their biodegradation capabilities. These SMC possess promising potential for efficient keratinous valorization. More importantly, this reasoning and methodology could be transferred to other topics involving screening for simplified communities for biodegradation, thus considerably broadening its application scope.\\n\\nImportanceMicrobial consortia have got more and more attention and extensive applications due to their potential advantages. However, a high diversity of microbes is likely to hide uncontrollable risks in practice specific to novel strains and complicated interaction networks. Exploring a convenient and efficient way to construct simplified microbial consortia is able to broaden the applied scope of microbes. This study presents the approach based on enrichment and dilution-to-extinction cultures, which gain abundance microbial consortia including some without losing efficiency from the enriched functional microbial community. The microbial interactions at the strain level were evaluated by using compositional identification and correlation analysis, which contribute to revealing the roles of microbes in the degradation process of recalcitrant materials. Our findings provide a systematic scheme to achieve optimizing microbial consortia for biodegradation from an environmental sample, could be readily applied to a range of recalcitrant materials management from environmental remediation to industrial applications.",

Using targeted chemogenetic in vivo approaches in the adult mouse visual cortex, we found that transient electrical silencing of PV interneurons, directly or through inhibition of local excitatory neurons, induced PNN regression. Conversely, excitation of either neuron types did not reduce the PNN. We also observed that chemogenetically inhibited PV interneurons exhibited reduced PNN compared to their untransduced neighbors, and confirmed that single PV interneurons express multiple genes enabling cell-autonomous control of their own PNN density. Our results indicate that PNNs are dynamically regulated in the adult by PV neurons acting as sensors of their local microcircuit activities. PNN regulation provides individual PV neurons with an activity-dependent mechanism to control the local remodeling of adult cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "Video and image data are regularly used in the field of benthic ecology to document biodiversity. However, their use is subject to a number of challenges, principally the identification of taxa within the images without associated physical specimens. The challenge of applying traditional taxonomic keys to the identification of fauna from images has led to the development of personal, group, or institution level reference image catalogues of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or morphospecies. Lack of standardisation among these reference catalogues has led to problems with observer bias and the inability to combine datasets across studies. In addition, lack of a common reference standard is stifling efforts in the application of artificial intelligence to taxon identification. Using the North Atlantic deep sea as a case study, we propose a database structure to facilitate standardisation of morphospecies image catalogues between research groups and support future use in multiple front-end applications. We also propose a framework for coordination of international efforts to develop reference guides for the identification of marine species from images. The proposed structure follows the Darwin Core standard to allow integration with existing databases. We suggest a management framework where high-level taxonomic groups are curated by a regional team, consisting of both end users and taxonomic experts. We identify a mechanism by which overall quality of data within a common reference guide could be raised over the next decade. Finally, we discuss the role of a common reference standard in advancing marine ecology and supporting sustainable use of this ecosystem.",

Since a previous study in 2007, GH13_1 amylases were considered ancestral to the Unikonts, including animals, except Bilateria, such that it was thought to have been lost in the ancestor of this clade. The only alpha-amylases known to be present in Bilateria so far belong to the GH13_15 and 24 subfamilies (commonly called bilaterian alpha-amylases) and were likely acquired by horizontal transfer from a proteobacterium. The taxonomic scope of Eukaryota genomes in databases has been greatly increased ever since 2007. We have surveyed GH13_1 sequences in recent data from ca. 1600 bilaterian species, 60 non-bilaterian animals and also in unicellular eukaryotes. As expected, we found a number of those sequences in non-bilaterians: Anthozoa (Cnidaria) and in sponges, confirming the previous observations, but none in jellyfishes and in Ctenophora. Our main and unexpected finding is that such fungal (also called Dictyo-type) amylases were also consistently retrieved in several bilaterian phyla: hemichordates (deuterostomes), brachiopods and related phyla, some molluscs and some annelids (protostomes). We discuss evolutionary hypotheses possibly explaining the scattered distribution of GH13_1 across bilaterians, namely, the retention of the ancestral gene in those phyla only and/or horizontal transfers from non-bilaterian donors.",

    "abstract": "Global and local ancestry inference in admixed human populations can be performed using computational tools implementing distinct algorithms, such as RFMix and ADMIXTURE. The accuracy of these tools has been tested largely on populations with relatively straightforward admixture histories but little is known about how well they perform in more complex admixture scenarios. Using simulations, we show that RFMix outperforms ADMIXTURE in determining global ancestry proportions in a complex 5-way admixed population. In addition, RFMix correctly assigns local ancestry with an accuracy of 89%. The increase in reported local ancestry inference accuracy in this population (as compared to previous studies) can largely be attributed to the recent availability of large-scale genotyping data for more representative reference populations. The ability of RFMix to determine global and local ancestry to a high degree of accuracy, allows for more reliable population structure analysis, scans for natural selection, admixture mapping and case-control association studies. This study highlights the utility of the extension of computational tools to become more relevant to genetically structured populations, as seen with RFMix. This is particularly noteworthy as modern-day societies are becoming increasingly genetically complex and some genetic tools are therefore less appropriate. We therefore suggest that RFMix be used for both global and local ancestry estimation in complex admixture scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Most known examples of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between eukaryotes are ancient. These events are identified primarily using phylogenetic methods on coding regions alone. Only rarely are there examples of HGT where non-coding DNA is also reported. The gene encoding the wheat virulence protein ToxA and surrounding 14 kb is one of these rare examples. ToxA has been horizontally transferred between three fungal wheat pathogens (Parastagonospora nodorum, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Bipolaris sorokiniana) as part of a conserved [~]14kb element, which contains coding and non-coding regions. Here we use long-read sequencing to define the extent of HGT between these three fungal species. Construction of near-chromosomal level assemblies enabled identification of terminal inverted repeats on either end of the 14kb region, typical of a Type II DNA transposon. This is the first description of ToxA with complete transposon features, which we call ToxhAT. In all three species, ToxhAT resides in a large (140-250 kb) transposon-rich genomic island which is absent in toxA- isolates. We demonstrate that the horizontal transfer of ToxhAT between Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and P. nodorum occurred as part of a large [~]80kb HGT which is now undergoing extensive decay. In contrast, in B. sorokiniana ToxhAT and its resident genomic island are mobile within the genome. Together these data provide insight into the non-coding regions that facilitate HGT between eukaryotes and the genomic processes which mask the extent of HGT between these species.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThis work dissects the tripartite horizontal transfer of ToxA; a gene that has a direct negative impact on global wheat yields. Defining the extent of horizontally transferred DNA is important because it can provide clues as to the mechanisms that facilitate HGT. Our analysis of ToxA and its surrounding 14kb suggests that this gene was horizontally transferred in two independent events, with one event likely facilitated by a Type II DNA transposon. These horizontal transfer events are now in various processes of decay in each species due to the repeated insertion of new transposons and subsequent rounds of targeted mutation by a fungal genome defense mechanism known as repeat induced point-mutation. This work highlights the role that HGT plays in the evolution of host adaptation in eukaryotic pathogens. It also increases the growing body of evidence that transposons facilitate adaptive HGT events between fungi present in similar environments and hosts.\\n\\nDATA AVAILABILITYAll raw sequencing data is available under NCBI BioProject PRJNA505097.\\n\\nThe P. nodorum SN15 Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession SSHU00000000.

    "abstract": "Batch effect correction has been recognized to be indispensable when integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple batches. State-of-the-art methods ignore single-cell cluster label information, but such information can improve effectiveness of batch effect correction, particularly under realistic scenarios where biological differences are not orthogonal to batch effects. To address this issue, we propose SMNN for batch effect correction of scRNA-seq data via supervised mutual nearest neighbor detection. Our extensive evaluations in simulated and real datasets show that SMNN provides improved merging within the corresponding cell types across batches, leading to reduced differentiation across batches over MNN, Seurat v3, and LIGER. Furthermore, SMNN retains more cell type-specific features, partially manifested by differentially expressed genes identified between cell types after SMNN correction being biologically more relevant, with precision improving by up to 841%.\n\nKey PointsO_LIBatch effect correction has been recognized to be critical when integrating scRNA-seq data from multiple batches due to systematic differences in time points, generating laboratory and/or handling technician(s), experimental protocol, and/or sequencing platform.\nC_LIO_LIExisting batch effect correction methods that leverages information from mutual nearest neighbors across batches (for example, implemented in SC3 or Seurat) ignore cell type information and suffer from potentially mismatching single cells from different cell types across batches, which would lead to undesired correction results, especially under the scenario where variation from batch effects is non-negligible compared with biological effects.\nC_LIO_LITo address this critical issue, here we present SMNN, a supervised machine learning method that first takes cluster/cell-type label information from users or inferred from scRNA-seq clustering, and then searches mutual nearest neighbors within each cell type instead of global searching.\nC_LIO_LIOur SMNN method shows clear advantages over three state-of-the-art batch effect correction methods and can better mix cells of the same cell type across batches and more effectively recover cell-type specific features, in both simulations and real datasets.\nC_LI",

The pattern of inheritance, however, resembled that of a nuclear gene. The authors explained this peculiarity with Mendelian segregation of a faulty gatekeeper gene that permits survival of paternal mtDNA in the oocyte. Three other groups (Vissing, 2019; Lutz-Bonengel and Parson, 2019; Salas et al, 2019), however, posited the observation was an artifact of inheritance of mtDNA nuclear pseudogenes (NUMTs), present in the fathers nuclear genome. We present justification that both interpretations are incorrect, but that the original authors did, in fact, observe biparental inheritance of mtDNA. Our alternative model assumes that because of initially low paternal mtDNA copy number these copies are randomly partitioned into nascent cell lineages. The paternal mtDNA haplotype must have a selective advantage, so  seeded cells will tend to proceed to fixation of the paternal haplotype in the course of development. We use modeling to emulate the dynamics of paternal genomes and predict their mode of inheritance and distribution in somatic tissue. The resulting offspring is a mosaic of cells that are purely maternal or purely paternal - including in the germline. This mosaicism explains the quasi-Mendelian segregation of the paternal mDNA. Our model is based on known aspects of mtDNA biology and explains all of the experimental observations outlined in Luo et. al., including maternal inheritance of the grand-paternal mtDNA.",

Contigs annotation, molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence in symptomatic plants of a virus complex consisting of shallot virus X (ShVX, Allexivirus), shallot latent virus (SLV, Carlavirus) and two novel viruses belonging to the genera Carlavirus and Potyvirus, for which the names of shallot virus S (ShVS) and shallot mild yellow stripe associated virus (SMYSaV), are proposed. Complete or near complete genomic sequences were obtained for all these agents, revealing divergent isolates of ShVX and SLV. Trials to fulfill Kochs postulates were pursued but failed to reproduce the symptoms on inoculated shallots, even though the plants were proved to be infected by the four viruses detected by HTS. Replanting of bulbs from SMYSaV-inoculated shallot plants resulted in infected plants, showing that the virus can perpetuate the infection over seasons. A survey analyzing 351 shallot samples over a four years period strongly suggests an association of SMYSaV with the disease symptoms. An analysis of SMYSaV diversity indicates the existence of two clusters of isolates, one of which is largely predominant in the field over years.\\n\\nThe sequences reported in the present manuscript have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers MG571549, MH292861, MH389247 to MH389255, and MG910501 to MG910598.",

    "abstract": "Attention to biosecurity has been highlighted as the most important measure to reduce and prevent the introduction of diseases to farms. There is little published information about the biosecurity of dairy cattle in Spain. We therefore aimed to assess and characterize the current application of biosecurity measures on dairy cattle farms in Spain, and relate these to bovine viral diarrhea and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. From July 2017 to April 2018, data on biosecurity measures for 124 dairy herds were collected using a questionnaire. We also assessed the sanitary status of these farms (efficacy of measures implemented against both diseases using antibody ELISA. Data were analyzed descriptively, and using multiple correspondence analysis and a two-step cluster analysis. Measures to prevent disease introduction were often poorly implemented. Three main clusters of farms were identified: Clusters 1 and 2 included herds of small and intermediate sizes, respectively. These, particularly cluster 1, showed the most deficiencies in the control of vehicles and visitors. However, individual purchases usually involved low numbers of animals, especially in cluster 2, and animals were tested for bovine viral diarrhea and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis at their places of origin or on arrival at farms. Farms in clusters 1 and 2 were frequently under voluntary control programs. Cluster 3 had the largest herd sizes, with somewhat better biosecurity control of vehicles and visitors. However, farms in this cluster also purchased the most animals, sometimes without testing, and hired external workers most often. Farms in cluster 1 showed the best sanitary level, followed by clusters 2 and 3. Collecting data such as these is an important first step to identification of biosecurity shortcomings, and to structuring of adequate follow-up to ensure that measures are implemented correctly on farms in Spain.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIn Cote dIvoire, maternal health service utilization indicators remain low despite improvements in health coverage and the availability of free health care for pregnant women. The objective of the study was to identify the determinants associated with the use of maternal health services in the department of Blolequin, in western Cote dIvoire.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study with an analytical focus. The study sample size was 400 women. Study participants were selected through a two-stage cluster survey. The data were collected using a standardized questionnaire whose items concerned socio-demographic data, the different uses of maternal health services, namely childbirth assisted by a health professional, use of family planning, prenatal consultation and post-natal consultation. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with the use of maternal health services. The significance of the statistical tests was set at 5%. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and interpreted.\\n\\nResultsThe results showed that women made less use of family planning services (OR=0.4), prenatal consultation (OR=0.2) and assisted childbirth (OR=0.2) when they provided the funding for care themselves. Women with incomes above $26.8 used family planning services 4 times more than those with lower incomes. Married women used prenatal consultations 3 times more often than unmarried women (CI95% = 1.4 - 7.3). Desiring pregnancy increased the use of post-natal consultations by 3 times (CI95% = 1.5 - 6.1).\\n\\nConclusionImproving the use of maternal health services in western Cote dIvoire requires taking into account womens socio-cultural and economic challenges. In initiatives related to the financial empowerment of women, efforts must be made at the level of emotional factors related to pregnancy.",

We studied the effects of varying the density of Cynodon dactylon on the growth and development of the invasive plant species Tagetes minuta and Gutenbergia cordifolia in pot and field plot experiments following a completely randomized design. Increasing densities of C. dactylon strongly reduced T. minuta and G. cordifolia growth and development, leaf total chlorophyll and increased leaf anthocyanin of both invasive species. These detrimental effects may have contributed to poorer T. minuta and G. cordifolia performance under C. dactylon densities of more than 8 individuals per pot/plot compared to those in pots/plots without C. dactylon.

    "abstract": "Slug/Snail2 belongs to the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-inducing transcription factors involved in development and diseases. Slug is expressed in adult stem/progenitor cells of several epithelia, making it unique among these transcription factors. To investigate Slug role in human bronchial epithelium progenitors, we studied primary bronchial basal/progenitor cells in an air-liquid interface culture system that allows regenerating a bronchial epithelium. To identify Slug downstream genes we knocked down Slug in basal/progenitor cells from normal subjects and subjects with COPD, a respiratory disease presenting anomalies in the bronchial epithelium and high levels of TGF-{beta} in the lungs. We show that normal and COPD bronchial basal/progenitors, even when treated with TGF-{beta}, express both epithelial and mesenchymal markers, and that the epithelial marker E-cadherin is not a target of Slug and, moreover, positively correlates with Slug. We reveal that Slug downstream genes responding to both differentiation and TGF-{beta} are different in normal and COPD progenitors, with in particular a set of proliferation-related genes that are among the genes repressed downstream of Slug in normal but not COPD. In COPD progenitors at the onset of differentiation in presence of TGF-{beta}, we show that there is positive correlations between the effect of differentiation and TGF-{beta} on proliferation-related genes and on Slug protein, and that their expression levels are higher than in normal cells. As well, the expression of Smad3 and {beta}-Catenin, two molecules from TGF-{beta} signaling pathways, are higher in COPD progenitors, and our results indicate that proliferation-related genes and Slug protein are increased by different TGF-{beta}-induced mechanisms.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/674127v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@524a15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7dd1e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5f3798org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13ae179_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS) skin infections are caused by a diverse array of strain types and are highly prevalent in Indigenous and other disadvantaged populations. The role of strain-specific immunity in preventing GAS infections is poorly understood, representing a critical knowledge gap in vaccine development. A recent GAS murine challenge study showed evidence that sterilising strain-specific and enduring immunity required two skin infections by the same GAS strain within three weeks. This mechanism of developing enduring immunity may be a significant impediment to the accumulation of immunity in populations.\\n\\nWe used a mathematical model of GAS transmission to investigate the epidemiological consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity developing only after two infections with the same strain within a specified interval. Accounting for uncertainty when correlating murine timeframes to humans, we varied this maximum inter-infection interval from 3 to 420 weeks to assess its impact on prevalence and strain diversity. Model outputs were compared with longitudinal GAS surveillance observations from northern Australia, a region with endemic infection. We also assessed the likely impact of a targeted strain-specific multivalent vaccine in this context.\\n\\nOur model produced patterns of transmission consistent with observations when the maximum inter-infection interval for developing enduring immunity was 19 weeks. Our vaccine analysis suggests that the leading multivalent GAS vaccine may have limited impact on the prevalence of GAS in populations in northern Australia if strain-specific immunity requires repeated episodes of infection.\\n\\nOur results suggest that observed GAS epidemiology from disease endemic settings is consistent with enduring strain-specific immunity being dependent on repeated infections with the same strain, and provide additional motivation for relevant human studies to confirm the human immune response to GAS skin infection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGroup A Streptococcus (GAS) is a ubiquitous bacterial pathogen that exists in many distinct strains, and is a major cause of death and disability globally. Vaccines against GAS are under development, but their effective use will require better understanding of how immunity develops following infection. Evidence from an animal model of skin infection suggests that the generation of enduring strain-specific immunity requires two infections by the same strain within a short time frame. It is not clear if this mechanism of immune development operates in humans, nor how it would contribute to the persistence of GAS in populations and affect vaccine impact. We used a mathematical model of GAS transmission, calibrated to data collected in an Indigenous Australian community, to assess whether this mechanism of immune development is consistent with epidemiological observations, and to explore its implications for the impact of a vaccine. We found that it is plausible that repeat infections are required for the development of immunity in humans, and illustrate the difficulties associated with achieving sustained reductions in disease prevalence with a vaccine.",

Here we present two novel filament-forming proteins in cyanobacteria. Surveying cyanobacterial genomes for coiled-coil-rich proteins (CCRPs) that are predicted as putative filament-forming proteins, we observed a higher proportion of CCRPs in filamentous cyanobacteria in comparison to unicellular cyanobacteria. Using our predictions, we identified nine protein families with putative intermediate filament (IF) properties. Polymerization assays revealed four proteins that formed polymers in vitro and three proteins that formed polymers in vivo. Fm7001 from Fischerella muscicola PCC 7414 polymerized in vitro and formed filaments in vivo in several organisms. Additionally, we identified a tetratricopeptide repeat protein - All4981 - in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 that polymerized into filaments in vitro and in vivo. All4981 interacts with known cytoskeletal proteins and is indispensable for Anabaena viability. Although it did not form filaments in vitro, Syc2039 from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 assembled into filaments in vivo and a {Delta}syc2039 mutant was characterized by an impaired cytokinesis. Our results expand the repertoire of known prokaryotic filament-forming CCRPs and demonstrate that cyanobacterial CCRPs are involved in cell morphology, motility, cytokinesis and colony integrity.",

We found that the protease activity, organic matter content and ammonium nitrogen concentration were higher in the early stage of composting. Meanwhile, the urease activity was highest in the high temperature period. The carbon to nitrogen ratio of the compost decreased continuously with fermentation. The dynamic change in the composition of bacterial overtime in the compost of a 180 kg piles were explored using microbial diversity analysis. The results showed that the microbial species increased with the compost fermentation. At the early stage of composting, the phyla of Firmicutes and Actinomycetes were dominant. The microbes in the high temperature period were mainly composed of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria while the proportion of Bacteroides was increased during the cooling period. In the compost of maturity stage, the proportion of Chloroflexi increased, becoming dominant species with other microorganisms including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Chloroflexi but not Actinomycetes. Bacteria involved in lignocellulose degradation, such as those of the Thermobifida, Cellvibrio, Mycobacterium, Streptomyces and Rhodococcus, were concentrated in the maturity stages of composting. Through correlation analysis, the environmental factors including organic matter, ammonium nitrogen and temperature were consistent with the succession of microbial including Rhodocyclaceae, Anaerolineaceae, Thiopseudomonas, Sinibacillus and Tepidimicrobium.

    "abstract": "Ingestion of the polyol mannitol caused sex-biased mortality in adult Drosophila melanogaster, but larval mortality was not sex-biased. High-sugar diets prolong development and generate smaller adult body sizes in D. melanogaster. We hypothesized that mannitol ingestion would generate similar developmental phenotypes as other high-carbohydrate diets. We predicted concentration-dependent effects on development similar to high-sugar diets when D. melanogaster larvae are fed mannitol, as well as a concentration-dependent amelioration of developmental effects if introduction to mannitol media is delayed past the third instar. Both male and female larvae had prolonged development and smaller adult body sizes when fed increasing concentrations of mannitol. Mannitol-induced increases in mortality were concentration dependent in 0 M to 0.8 M treatments beginning as early as 48 hours post-hatching. Larval survival, and pupation and eclosion times, were normal in 0.4 M mannitol treatments when larvae were first introduced to mannitol 72 hours post-hatching (the beginning of the third-instar); the adverse mannitol effects occurred in 0.8 M mannitol treatments, but at a lower magnitude. Female D. melanogaster adults prefer laying eggs on diets with high sugar concentrations, despite the negative effects on offspring performance. However, when given a choice, female D. melanogaster avoided laying eggs on mannitol-containing media that was otherwise identical to the control media, suggesting females perceived and avoided mannitol. In conclusion, the developmental effects of a larval mannitol diet closely resemble those of high-sugar diets, but adult female oviposition responses to mannitol in laying substrates are distinct from responses to other carbohydrates.",

Following short-term, repeated treatment with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at two different doses (1.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg), Sub mice presented significant place-aversion in a Conditioned Place Preference paradigm at a high dose, whereas Dom mice displayed no place preference or aversion. Forced Swim test conducted after 6-week of washout period, revealed differential impact of the two THC doses depending upon behavioral pattern. Specifically, the low dose alleviated depressive-like behavior in Sub mice, while the high dose produced the opposite effect in Dom mice. Interestingly, corticosterone concentration in serum was elevated at the high dose regardless of the mice-population tested. We conclude here that differences in dominance behavior and stress vulnerability are involved in the regulation of cannabis response among users and should be considered when prescribing THC-containing medications to patients.",

    "abstract": "The ability to establish spatial organization is an essential feature of any developing tissue and is achieved through well-defined rules of cell-cell communication. Maintenance of this organization requires elimination of cells with inappropriate positional identity, a poorly understood phenomenon. Here we studied mechanisms regulating cell elimination in the context of a growing tissue, the Drosophila wing disc and its dorsal determinant Apterous. Systematic analysis of apterous mutant clones along with their twin spots shows that they are eliminated from the dorsal compartment via three different mechanisms: sorting to the ventral compartment, basal extrusion, and death, depending on the position of the clone in the wing disc. We find that basal extrusion is the main elimination mechanism in the hinge, whereas apoptosis dominates in the pouch and in the notum. In the absence of apoptosis, extrusion takes over to ensure clearance in all regions. Notably, clones in the hinge grow larger than those in the pouch, emphasizing spatial differences. Mechanistically, we find that limiting cell division within the clones does not prevent their extrusion. Indeed, even clones of one or two cells can be extruded basally, demonstrating that the clone size is not the main determinant of the elimination mechanism to be used. Overall, we revealed three elimination mechanisms and their spatial biases for preserving pattern in a growing organ.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the consequences of increased bone mobilization in early lactation on the dynamics of the milk Ca content during lactation and bone reconstitution. Fifteen multiparous Holstein cows were distributed among 3 treatments 5 weeks before their expected calving date. Those treatments consisted of the provision of dedicated diets through the first 10 weeks of lactation. During that period, the control treatment (NCa) consisted of a diet providing 100\\\\% of the Ca requirements, with a dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) of 200 mEq/kg DM. The treatments LCa (Low Ca) and LCaLD (Low Ca, Low DCAD) consisted of diets providing 70% of the Ca requirements, with a DCAD of 200 and 0 mEq/kg DM for LCa and LCaLD, respectively. After 10 weeks, all cows received the same total mixed ration which was formulated to meet 100\\\\% of the Ca requirements. LCa and LCaLD tended to decrease the body retention of Ca at 3 weeks of lactation compared with NCa, but did not affect either the dynamics of the blood biomarkers of bone formation and resorption during the lactation or the body retention of Ca at 17 weeks of lactation. Cows almost entirely compensated for the decrease in Ca supply by increasing their apparent digestive absorption of Ca at 3 weeks of lactation, whereas the apparent digestive absorption was unaffected by the treatments at 17 weeks of lactation. Milk production tended to be lower throughout lactation with the LCa and LCaLD compared with the NCa, with a mean difference of 2 kg/d. This study indicated that measuring the dynamics of the milk Ca content during lactation cannot be considered effective for indirectly estimating the dynamics of bone mobilization of cows. The results also showed that limited Ca intake at the beginning of lactation can have deleterious effect on milk production.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a common nasopharyngeal commensal capable of infecting normally sterile anatomical sites, resulting in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Effective vaccines preventing IPD exist, but each of the antigens they contain typically induces protective immunity against only one of the approximately 100 pneumococcal serotypes, which are differentiated by immunogenically-distinct polysaccharide capsules. Serotypes vary in their propensity to cause IPD, quantified as their invasiveness. Vaccines are designed to include serotypes commonly isolated from IPD, but the immunity they induce is sufficiently strong to also eliminate vaccine serotypes from carriage. This enables their replacement by non-vaccine serotypes in the nasopharynx. The emergence of invasive non-vaccine serotypes has undermined some vaccination programmes benefits. Recent advances in genomics and modeling have enabled forecasting of which non-vaccine serotypes will be successful post-vaccination. Here, we demonstrate that vaccines optimised using this framework can minimise IPD and antibiotic-resistant disease more effectively than existing formulations in the model, through mitigating the consequences of serotype replacement. The simulations also demonstrate that tailoring vaccines to the pre-vaccine bacterial population is likely to have a substantial impact on reducing IPD, highlighting the importance of epidemiological data, genomics and ecological models as tools for vaccine design and evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) binding specificity is determined via a complex interplay between the TFs DNA binding preference and cell type-specific chromatin environments. The chromatin features that correlate with TF binding in a given cell type have been well characterized. For instance, the binding sites for a majority of TFs display concurrent chromatin accessibility. However, concurrent chromatin features reflect the binding activities of the TF itself, and thus provide limited insight into how genome-wide TF-DNA binding patterns became established in the first place. To understand the determinants of TF binding specificity, we therefore need to examine how newly activated TFs interact with sequence and preexisting chromatin landscapes.\n\nHere, we investigate the sequence and preexisting chromatin predictors of TF-DNA binding by examining the genome-wide occupancy of TFs that have been induced in well-characterized chromatin environments. We develop Bichrom, a bimodal neural network that jointly models sequence and preexisting chromatin data to interpret the genome-wide binding patterns of induced TFs. We find that the preexisting chromatin landscape is a differential global predictor of TF-DNA binding; incorporating preexisting chromatin features improves our ability to explain the binding specificity of some TFs substantially, but not others. Furthermore, by analyzing site-level predictors, we show that TF binding in previously inaccessible chromatin tends to correspond to the presence of more favorable cognate DNA sequences. Bichrom thus provides a framework for modeling, interpreting, and visualizing the joint sequence and chromatin landscapes that determine TF-DNA binding dynamics.",

We previously developed a novel pipeline, ESUCA, to comprehensively identify plant uORFs encoding functional peptides, based on genome-wide identification of uORFs with conserved peptide sequences (CPuORFs). Here, we applied ESUCA to diverse animal genomes, because animal CPuORFs have been identified only by comparing uORF sequences between a limited number of species, and how many previously identified CPuORFs encode regulatory peptides is unclear. By using ESUCA, 1,517 (1,373 novel and 144 known) CPuORFs were extracted from four evolutionarily divergent animal genomes. We examined the effects of 17 human CPuORFs on mORF translation using transient expression assays. Through these analyses, we identified seven novel regulatory CPuORFs that repressed mORF translation in a sequence-dependent manner, including one conserved only among Eutheria. We discovered a much higher number of animal CPuORFs than previously identified. Since most human CPuORFs identified in this study are conserved across a wide range of Eutheria or a wider taxonomic range, many CPuORFs encoding regulatory peptides are expected to be found in the identified CPuORFs.",

However, the hybridization-based methods are still limited by the intrinsic shortcomings of nucleic acid hybridization. This study developed a new CRISPR-based targeted sequencing technique, CRISPR-assisted targeted enrichment-sequencing (CATE-seq). In this technique, the input genomic DNA (gDNA) was firstly bound by a complex of dCas9 and capture sgRNA (csgRNA). The DNA-dCas9-csgRNA complex was then captured on magnetic beads through an easy room-temperature annealing between a short universal capture sequence (24 bp) at the 3' end of csgRNA and capture oligonucleotide coupled on magnetic beads. The enriched DNAs were finally analyzed by next generation sequencing. Using this technique, three different scales of targeted enrichments were successfully performed, including enriching 35 target exons of 6 genes from 6 gDNA samples with 54 csgRNAs, 339 target exons of 186 genes from 9 gDNA samples with 367 csgRNAs, and 2031 target exons of 451 genes from 2 gDNA samples with 2302 csgRNAs.

Here, we used genomic data and coalescent-based approaches to elucidate for the first time the demographic dynamics associated with the settlement by endemic reef fish fauna of one of the most remote peripheral islands of the Pacific Ocean, Rapa Nui (Easter Island). We compared the demographic history of nine endemic species in order to explore their demographic responses to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. We found that Rapa Nui endemic species share a common demographic history as signatures of population expansions were retrieved for almost all of the species studied here, and synchronous demographic expansions initiated during the last glacial period were recovered for more than half of the studied species. These results suggest that eustatic fluctuations associated with Milankovitch cycles have played a central role in species demographic histories and in the final stage of the community assembly of many Rapa Nui reef fishes. Specifically, sea level low stands resulted in the maximum reef habitat extension for Rapa Nui endemic species; we discuss the potential role of seamounts in allowing endemic species to cope with Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, and we highlight the importance of local historical processes over regional ones.

In congenital myelin disorders, OL dysfunction or death results in loss of myelin.

However, endogenous sources of glial progenitors are hard to obtain without causing secondary injury, while use of exogenous sources such as embryonic stem cells and induced-pluripotent stem cells face considerable ethical and safety issues.\n\nTo circumvent such hurdles, we asked whether NG2+ cells in the bone marrow could be a potential cell source for GPCs. We successfully generated glial progenitor cells (GPCs) from human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) from 3 donors using a 14- day induction protocol. The generated hBMSC-GPCs were highly enriched in OPC marker expression, including OLIG2, PDGFR, NG2, SOX10 and O4, and showed efficient differentiation into myelinogenic oligodendrocytes when transplanted into postnatal day 7 (P7) myelin-deficient shiverer mice.

    "abstract": "The dose dependent depletion of ovarian Ascorbic acid (AA) in rat ovaries, has been used as a bioassay for measurement of Luteinizing Hormone (LH). However, the mechanism of action of gonadotropin (LH, FSH) on ascorbic acid depletion is not completely clear in biochemical terms. To elucidate the mechanism, we looked for the pathways; one, where L-Gulonate Dehydrogenase (L-GuDH) catalyzes the conversion of L-Gulonic acid (L-GuA) to L-Xylulose, and, in the second the pathway conversion of L-GuA to AA, in a cats, dogs and Rats. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme L-GuDH in vitro showed the inhibitory effect of AA on L-GuDH. Therefore, we hypothesized that gonadotropins (FSH and LH) may regulate the L-GuDH maintain level of AA in ovary. LH administration to super-ovulated immature female rats caused depletion of ovarian AA but did not result in any change in the specific activity of the ovarian L-GuDH. Further, we administrated a surrogate FSH like hormone (PMSG) to immature female rats which, resulted in increased specific activity of ovarian L-GuDH. However, microarray data on RNA from ovaries exposed to FSH like hormone such as Pregnant Mare serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) did not reveal any increased expression of L-GuDH transcript. It is therefore concluded from the results obtained that; that neither LH, in decreasing the ovarian AA, nor FSH, in increasing the ovarian AA do so by regulating the activity of enzyme L-GuDH at transcriptional level. The results obtained have also been discussed by giving emphasis on the mechanism of ovarian ascorbic acid regulation of LH and FSH.",

Here, we used SureSelect targeted sequencing approach combined with Nanopore sequencing to overcome these limitations.

Alleles estimated from targeted long-read sequencing were concordant with gold standard PCR sizing analysis and moreover highly correlated with alleles estimated from whole genome long-read sequencing. We demonstrate a targeted long-read sequencing approach that enables simultaneous analysis of hundreds of TRs and accuracy is comparable to PCR sizing analysis.

To overcome these limitations, we present NanoVar, an accurate, rapid and low-depth (4X) 3GS SV caller utilizing long-reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. NanoVar employs split-reads and hard-clipped reads for SV detection and utilizes a neural network classifier for true SV enrichment. In simulated data, NanoVar demonstrated the highest SV detection accuracy (F1 score = 0.91) amongst other long-read SV callers using 12 gigabases (4X) of sequencing data. In patient samples, besides the detection of genomic aberrations, NanoVar also uncovered many normal alternative sequences or alleles which were present in healthy individuals. The low sequencing depth requirements of NanoVar enable the use of Nanopore sequencing for accurate SV characterization at a lower sequencing cost, an approach compatible with clinical studies and large-scale SV-association research.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic gliomas in companion dogs provide a window on the interaction between tumorigenic mechanisms and host environment. We compared the molecular profiles of canine gliomas with those of human pediatric and adult gliomas to characterize evolutionarily conserved mammalian mutational processes in gliomagenesis. Employing whole genome-, exome-, transcriptome-and methylation-sequencing of 81 canine gliomas, we found alterations shared between canine and human gliomas such as the receptor tyrosine kinases, p53 and cell cycle pathways, and IDH1 R132. Canine gliomas showed high similarity with human pediatric gliomas per robust aneuploidy, mutational rates, relative timing of mutations, and DNA methylation patterns. Our cross-species comparative genomic analysis provides unique insights into glioma etiology and the chronology of glioma-causing somatic alterations.\\n\\nSignificanceDiffuse gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors, with high-grade tumors carrying a dismal prognosis. Preclinical models have proven themselves as poor predictors of clinical efficacy. Spontaneous glioma in dogs provides an attractive alternative model, because of their comparable tumor microenvironment and tumor life history. We determined the similarities and differences between human and canine gliomas through genomic profiling, and leveraged our datasets to identify conserved somatic drivers, mutational processes and temporal ordering of somatic glioma events across species. We show that canine gliomas resemble human gliomas at (epi-)genetic levels and are more reminiscent of pediatric than adult disease, thus rationalizing sporadic canine glioma as a preclinical model tailored to measuring treatment efficacies in patients with canine or human glioma.",

    "abstract": "Intermediate filaments (IFs) are part of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells and are thus largely responsible for the cells mechanical properties. IFs are characterized by a pronounced extensibility and remarkable resilience that enable them to support cells in extreme situations. Previous experiments showed that under strain, -helices in vimentin IFs might unfold to {beta}-sheets. Upon repeated stretching, the filaments soften, however, the remaining plastic strain is negligible. Here we observe that vimentin IFs do not recover their original stiffness on reasonable time scales, and we explain these seemingly contradicting results by introducing a third, less well-defined conformational state. Reversibility on the nanoscale can be fully rescued by introducing crosslinkers that prevent transition to the {beta}-sheet. Our results classify IFs as a nano-material with intriguing mechanical properties, which is likely to play a major role for the cells local adaption to external stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The MAP kinase cascade is a ubiquitous eukaryotic signaling module that can be controlled by a diverse group of scaffold proteins. In budding yeast, activation of the mating MAP kinase cascade involves regulated membrane recruitment of the archetypal scaffold protein Ste5. This event promotes activation of the first kinase, but it also enhances subsequent signal propagation through the remainder of the cascade. By studying this latter effect, we find that membrane recruitment promotes signaling in trans between kinases on separate Ste5 molecules. First, trans signaling requires all Ste5 domains that mediate membrane recruitment, including both protein-binding and membrane-binding domains. Second, artificial membrane tethering of Ste5 can drive trans signaling, bypassing the need for native localization domains. Third, trans signaling can occur even if the first kinase does not bind the scaffold but instead is localized independently to the plasma membrane. Moreover, the trans signaling reaction allowed us to separate Ste5 into distinct functional domains, and then achieve normal regulation of signal output by tethering one domain to the membrane and stimulating membrane recruitment of the other. Overall, the results support a heterogeneous \\\"ensemble\\\" model of signaling in which scaffolds need not organize multiprotein complexes but instead can serve as binding sinks that co-concentrate enzymes and substrates at specific subcellular locales. These properties relax assembly constraints for scaffold proteins, increase regulatory flexibility, and can facilitate both natural evolution and artificial design of new signaling proteins and pathways.",

The coupling of ribosomes to receptors has been proposed as a mechanism linking signals to local translation but it is not known how broadly this mechanism operates, nor whether it can selectively regulate mRNA translation. We report that receptor-ribosome coupling is employed by multiple guidance cue receptors and this interaction is mRNA-dependent. We find that different receptors bind to distinct sets of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Cue stimulation induces rapid dissociation of ribosomes from receptors and the selective translation of receptor-specific mRNAs in retinal axon growth cones. Further, we show that receptor-ribosome dissociation and cue-induced selective translation are inhibited by simultaneous exposure to translation-repressive cues, suggesting a novel mode of signal integration. Our findings reveal receptor-specific interactomes and provide a general model for the rapid, localized and selective control of cue-induced translation.",

    "abstract": "Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow for the diffusion of small ions and solutes between coupled cells. Connexin 43 (Cx43), also known as Gap Junction Protein 1, is the most broadly expressed gap junction protein in vertebrate development. Cx43 is strongly expressed in premigratory cranial neural crest cells and is maintained throughout the neural crest cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but its function in these cells is not known. To this end, we have used a combination of in vivo and ex vivo live imaging with confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and functional assays to assess gap junction formation, and Cx43 function, in chick premigratory cranial neural crest cells. Our results demonstrate that gap junctions exist between chick premigratory and migratory cranial neural crest cells, with Cx43 depletion inhibiting the function of gap junctions. While a reduction in Cx43 levels just prior to neural crest cell EMT did not affect EMT and subsequent emigration of neural crest cells from the neural tube, the size of the premigratory neural crest cell domain was decreased in the absence of any changes in cell proliferation or death. Collectively, these data identify a role for Cx43 within the chick premigratory cranial neural crest cell population prior to EMT and migration.",

Unfortunately, every childhood cancer survivor will develop a chronic health problem, one of the most serious being cardiac disease. How doxorubicin damages the heart in such a way that disease progression occurs over multiple decades is still not understood.\\n\\nThe dose of doxorubicin selected does not cause apoptosis but does arrest cell cycle. It also decreases the cells ability to migrate. Gene profiling indicated a cardiac remodeling and inflammatory profile. Mitochondria increased ROS production and underwent membrane depolarization. Secondly, the Parkin:p53 interaction mechanism was investigated. Doxorubicin was found to increase p53 expression and it was shown to sequester Parkin. As a result, mitophagy in doxorubicin-treated cells was decreased. Lastly, cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from p53-/- mice and treated with doxorubicin. The gene expression phenotype in these cells was attenuated and migration was restored. Proliferation was still decreased. Mitochondrial dysfunction was also partially attenuated. Without p53, Parkin could now localize to the mitochondria and mitophagy was restored.\\n\\nDoxorubicin induces a deleterious phenotype in cardiac fibroblasts that may be due to the interaction between two stress responses caused by doxorubicins DNA and mitochondrial damage. Cardiac fibroblasts are a viable target and further research needs to be done to elucidate other harmful mechanisms at play in the fibroblast.

    "abstract": "Cells use multiple mechanisms to regulate their metabolic states depending on changes in their nutrient environment. A well-known example is the response of cells to glucose availability. In S. cerevisiae cells growing in glucose-limited medium, the re-availability of glucose leads to the downregulation of gluconeogenesis, the activation of glycolysis, and robust  glucose repression. However, our knowledge of the initial mechanisms mediating this glucose-dependent downregulation of the gluconeogenic transcription factors is incomplete. We used the gluconeogenic transcription factor Rds2 as a candidate with which to discover regulators of early events leading to glucose repression. Here, we identify a novel role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pib1 in regulating the stability and degradation of Rds2. Glucose addition to glucose-limited cells results in rapid ubiquitination of Rds2, followed by its proteasomal degradation. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we establish Pib1 as a ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates Rds2 ubiquitination and stability. Notably, this Pib1 mediated Rds2 ubiquitination, followed by proteasomal degradation, is specific to the presence of glucose. Pib1 is required for complete glucose repression, and enables cells to optimally grow in competitive environments when glucose becomes re-available. Our results reveal the existence of a Pib1 E3-ubiquitin ligase mediated regulatory program that mediates glucose-repression when glucose availability is restored.",

A fundamental assumption underlying this approach is there is minimal cell to cell variability in the response to drug. Here, we demonstrate that ensemble and non-spatial single cell readouts applied to primary cells lead to incomplete conclusions due to cell to cell variability. We exposed primary fetal pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) isolated from healthy newborn healthy and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) sheep to the growth hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). We found that IGF-1 increased proliferation and branch points in tube formation assays but not angiogenic signaling proteins at the population level for both cell types. We hypothesized that this molecular ambiguity was due to the presence of cellular subpopulations with variable responses to IGF-1. Using high throughput single cell imaging, we discovered a spatially localized response to IGF-1. This suggests localized signaling or heritable cell response to external stimuli may ultimately be responsible for our observations. Discovering and further exploring these rare cells is critical to finding new molecular targets to restore cellular function.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant chromatin structure is a hallmark in cancer cells and has long been used for clinical diagnosis of cancer. However, underlying higher-order chromatin folding during malignant transformation remains elusive, due to the lack of molecular scale resolution. Using optimized stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) for pathological tissue (PathSTORM), we uncovered a gradual decompaction and fragmented higher-order chromatin folding throughout all stages of carcinogenesis in multiple tumor types, even prior to the tumor formation. Our integrated imaging, genomic, and transcriptomic analyses reveal the functional consequences in enhanced formation of transcription factories, spatial juxtaposition with relaxed nanosized chromatin domains and impaired genomic stability. We also demonstrate the potential of imaging higher-order chromatin decompaction to detect high-risk precursors that cannot be distinguished by conventional pathology. Taken together, our findings reveal the gradual decompaction and fragmentation of higher-order chromatin structure as an enabling characteristic in early carcinogenesis to facilitate malignant transformation, which may improve cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, and prevention.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEGenomic DNA is folded into a higher-order structure that regulates transcription and maintains genomic stability. Although much progress has been made on understanding biochemical characteristics of epigenetic modifications in cancer, the higher-order folding of chromatin structure remains largely unknown. Using optimized super-resolution microscopy, we uncover de-compacted and fragmented chromatin folding in tumor initiation and stepwise progression in multiple tumor types, even prior to the presence of tumor cells. This study underlines the significance of unfolding higher-order chromatin structure as an enabling characteristic to promote tumorigenesis, which may facilitate the development and evaluation of new preventive strategies. The potential of imaging higher-order chromatin folding to improve cancer detection and risk stratification is demonstrated by detecting high-risk precursors that cannot be distinguished by conventional pathology.",

    "abstract": "Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are an essential adult stem cell population with the capacity to self-renew and regenerate muscle tissue. Functionally heterogeneous subpopulations of MuSCs have been identified based on their expression of myogenic regulatory factors and surface markers. However, a unified organization of muscle stem and progenitor cells and their subpopulations remains unresolved. Here, we performed temporal analysis of skeletal muscle regeneration using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of myotoxin-injured adult mouse hindlimb muscles. We generated over 34,000 single-cell transcriptomes spanning four muscle regeneration time-points and identified 15 distinct cell types, including a heterogeneous population of MuSCs and progenitor cells. Our analysis provides a hierarchical map of myogenic cell populations and identifies stage-specific regulatory programs that govern their contributions to muscle regeneration. In this transcriptomic atlas, we observed cell type-specific regenerative dynamics, exemplified by waves of transient amplification and diversification of multiple immune cell types and, subsequently, myogenic cells. Unbiased trajectory inference organized the myogenic cell populations within the atlas into a continuum, consisting of a hierarchy of quiescent MuSCs, cycling progenitors, committed myoblasts, and terminally differentiated myocytes. This myogenic trajectory matched prior understanding and also revealed that MuSC stages are defined by synchronous changes in regulatory factors, cell cycle-associated, and surface receptor gene expression. Lastly, we analyzed the transcriptomic atlas to identify over 100 candidate heterotypic communication signals between myogenic and non-myogenic cell populations, including many involving the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Notch, and Syndecan receptor families and their associated ligands. Syndecan receptors were implicated in a large fraction of these cell communication interactions and were observed to exhibit transcriptional heterogeneity within the myogenic continuum. Using multiparameter mass cytometry (CyTOF), we confirmed that cycling MuSCs exhibit diversified Syndecan-1/2 expression, which suggests that dynamic alterations in Syndecan signaling interactions may coordinate stage-specific myogenic cell fate regulation. This scRNA-seq reference atlas provides a resolved hierarchical organization of myogenic subpopulations as a resource to investigate cell-cell interactions that regulate myogenic stem and progenitor cell fates in muscle regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) both self-renew and give rise to progenitor spermatogonia that enter steady-state spermatogenesis in the mammalian testis. However, questions remain regarding the extent to which SSCs and progenitors represent stably distinct spermatogonial subtypes. Here we provide the first multiparametric integrative analysis of mammalian germ cell epigenomes comparable to that done by the ENCODE Project for >100 somatic cell types. Differentially expressed genes distinguishing SSCs and progenitors showed distinct histone modification patterns as well as differences in distal intergenic low-methylated regions. Motif-enrichment analysis predicted transcription factors that regulate this spermatogonial subtype-specific epigenetic programming, and gene-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed subtype-specific differences in binding of a subset of these factors to target genes. Collectively, these results suggest that SSCs and progenitors are stably distinct spermatogonial subtypes differentially programmed to either self-renew and maintain regenerative capacity as SSCs, or lose regenerative capacity and initiate lineage commitment as progenitors.",
