    "abstract": "This study applies a novel computational strategy to investigate molecular recognition and binding kinetics using five pyrazolourea ligands dissociating from cyclin-dependent kinase 8 with cyclin C (CDK8/CycC) as an example. The computed free energy barriers guide designing compounds using the transient conformations unavailable in experiments. The intermediates and their free energy profile during ligand association and discussion processes control ligand-protein binding kinetics and bring a more complete picture of ligand-protein binding. We used metadynamics and a pathway search method to sample pathways and applied combined reduced dimensionality, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and milestoning theory to construct the free energy profile and estimate the residence time. The binding free energy and the trend of binding kinetics agreed with experiments. We explain the why of the barriers and the kinetics and use the information to assist ligand design. Guided by a barrier of a ligand passing an C helix and activation loop, we introduced one hydroxyl group to parent compounds to design our ligands with increased residence time and validated our prediction by experiments. This work provides a novel and robust approach to investigate dissociation kinetics of large and flexible systems for understanding unbinding mechanisms and designing new small molecule drugs with desired binding kinetics.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe transient conformations during ligand binding/unbinding control non-covalent binding kinetics. However, the transient structures and their free energy landscape of flexible ligand-protein systems are unavailable in experiments and challenging to model. Due to lack of understanding in binding kinetics, even scientists know that kinetic properties can be important in drug development, calculations using the intermediate states to design ligands with preferred binding kinetics are absent. We overcome these challenges and compute ligand-protein unbinding free energy profile using a novel method with molecular dynamics simulations, reduced dimensionality, and milestoning theory to deepen our understanding in molecular recognition. We also designed compounds based on the computed free energy barriers and experimentally validated that our designed compound can increase residence time.",

    "abstract": "For decades, research into memory decline in human cognitive aging has focused on neocortical regions, the hippocampus, and dopaminergic neuromodulation. Recent findings indicate that the locus coeruleus (LC) and noradrenergic neuromodulation may also play an important role in shaping memory development in later life. However, technical challenges in quantifying LC integrity have hindered the study of LC-cognition associations in humans. Using high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging, we found that individual differences in learning and memory were positively associated with LC integrity across a variety of memory tasks in younger (n = 66), and older adults (n = 228). Moreover, we observed functionally relevant age differences confined to rostral LC. Older adults with a more youth-like rostral LC also showed higher memory performance. These findings link non-invasive, in vivo indices of LC integrity to memory in aging and highlight the role of the LC norepinephrine system in the decline of cognition.",

    "abstract": "The parafascicular nucleus (Pf) of the thalamus projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a major target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinsons disease (PD), but the function of this projection remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetics, 3D motion capture, in vivo electrophysiology and 1-photon calcium imaging, unsupervised behavioral classification, and viral-based neuroanatomical tracing to examine the contribution of Pf efferents to movement generation in mice. We discovered that Pf neurons are highly correlated with movement velocity and excitation of Pf neurons generates turning and orienting movements. Movement initiation was not due to Pf projections to the striatum, but rather its projections to the STN. Optogenetic excitation of the Pf-STN pathway restores movement in a common mouse model of PD with complete akinesia. Collectively, our results reveal a thalamo-subthalamic pathway regulating movement initiation, and demonstrate a circuit mechanism that could potentially explain the clinical efficacy of DBS for relief of PD motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Miltefosine is an FDA approved oral drug for treating cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania is a flagellated protozoa, which infects and differentiates in macrophages. Here, we studied the effects of Miltefosine on macrophages lipid homeostasis, autophagy, and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly/activity. Miltefosine treatment conferred multiple effects on macrophage lipid homeostasis leading to increased cholesterol release from cells, increased lipid-raft disruption, decreased phosphatidylserine (PS) flip from the cell-surface, and redistribution of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from the plasma membrane to actin rich regions in the cells. Enhanced basal autophagy, lipophagy and mitophagy was observed in cells treated with Miltefosine vs. control. Miltefosine treated cells showed marked increased in phosphorylation of kinases involved in autophagy induction such as; Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK1). The Toll like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway was blunted by Miltefosine treatment, resulting in decreased TLR4 recruitment to cell-surface and ~75% reduction in LPS induced pro-IL-1{beta} mRNA levels. Miltefosine reduced endotoxin-mediated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and protected the mitochondrial membrane potential. Miltefosine treatment induced mitophagy and dampened NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Collectively, our data shows that Miltefosine induced ABCA1 mediated cholesterol release, induced AMPK phosphorylation and mitophagy, while dampening NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and IL-1{beta} release.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAtherosclerosis is driven by cholesterol accumulation and inflammation, and the arterial macrophage is a key cell type in both of these processes. The macrophage characteristics that protect against atherosclerosis include increased cholesterol efflux/reverse cholesterol transport, increased autophagy, and deceased inflammatory cytokine production and signaling. Here, we show that one single orally available compound, Miltefosine, can target multiple macrophage pathways involved in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. Miltefosine activated cholesterol release and autophagy while inhibiting pro IL-1{beta} gene expression and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Miltefosine activated AMPK signaling pathway and mitophagy, leading to reduced NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and IL-1{beta} release.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression patterns help to measure and characterize the effect of environmental perturbations at the cellular and organism-level. Complicating interpretation is the presence of uncharacterized or \\\"hypothetical\\\" gene functions for a large percentage of genomes. This is particularly evident in Daphnia genomes, which contains many regions coding for \\\"hypothetical proteins\\\" and are significantly divergent from many of the available arthropod model species, but might be ecologically important. In the present study, we developed a gene expression database, the Daphnia stressor database (http://www.daphnia-stressordb.uni-hamburg.de/dsdbstart.php), built from 90 published studies on Daphnia gene expression. Using a comparative genomics approach, we used the database to annotate D. galeata transcripts. The extensive body of literature available for Daphnia species allowed to associate stressors with gene expression patterns. We believe that our stressor based annotation strategy allows for better understanding and interpretation of the functional role of the understudied hypothetical or uncharacterized Daphnia genes, thereby increasing our understanding of Daphnias genetic and phenotypic variability.",

Specifically, PSM1 and PSM4 structure the S. aureus biofilm by assembling into robust cross-{beta} amyloid fibrils. PSM3, the most cytotoxic member of the family, assembles into cross- fibrils in which -helices stack into tightly mated sheets, mimicking the cross-{beta} architecture. Here we demonstrated that massive T-cell deformation and death is linked with PSM3 aggregation and co-localization with cell membranes. Our extensive mutagenesis analyses supported the role of positive charges, and especially Lys17, in interactions with the membrane, and suggested their regulation by inter- and intra-helical electrostatic interactions within the cross- fibril. We hypothesize that PSM3 cytotoxicity is governed by the ability to form cross- fibrils and involves a dynamic process of co-aggregation with cell membrane, rupturing it.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe cytotoxic S. aureus PSM3 assembles into cross- fibrils\nC_LIO_LICross- fibril polymorphism and mutations-induced secondary structure switching\nC_LIO_LIRegulation by cross- fibril inter- and intra-helical electrostatic interactions\nC_LIO_LIToxicity as a putative dynamic process of PSM3 co-aggregation with membranes\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Achieving high intraspecific genetic diversity is a critical goal in ecological restoration as it increases the adaptive potential and long-term resilience of populations. Thus, we investigated genetic diversity within and between pristine sites in a fossil flood-plain and compared it to sites restored by hay-transfer between 1997 and 2014. RAD-seq genotyping revealed that the stenoecious flood-plain species Arabis nemorensis is co-occurring in pristine and restored sites with its relative Arabis sagittata, which has a documented preference for dry calcareous grasslands but has not been reported in floodplain meadows. We show that hay-transfer maintains genetic diversity for both species. In addition, in A. sagittata, transfer from multiple genetically isolated pristine sites resulted in restored sites with increased diversity and admixed local genotypes. In A. nemorensis, transfer also maintained diversity, but did not create novel admixture dynamics because genetic diversity between pristine sites was less differentiated. Thus, the effects of hay-transfer on genetic diversity also depend on the genetic makeup of each species in the donor communities, especially when material is mixed. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of hay-transfer for habitat restoration and emphasize the importance of pre-restoration characterization of micro-geographic patterns of intraspecific diversity of the community to guarantee that restoration practices reach their goal, i.e. maximize the adaptive potential of the entire restored plant community. Overseeing these patterns may differentially alter the adaptive potential of species present, thereby altering the balance between species in the community. Additionally, our comparison of summary statistics obtained from de novo and reference-based RAD-seq pipelines show that the genomic impact of restoration can be reliably monitored on species lacking prior genomic knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Empirical testing of chemicals for desirable properties, such as drug efficacy, toxicity, solubility, and thermal conductivity, costs many billions of dollars every year. Further, the choice of molecules for testing relies on expert knowledge and intuition in the relevant domain of application. The ability to predict the action of a molecule in silico would greatly increase the speed and decrease the cost of prioritizing molecules with desirable function for experimental testing. We explore the use of molecule structures to predict their drug classification without any explicit biological model (e.g. protein structure or cell system). Two approaches were compared: (1) a two-dimensional image representation of molecule structure with transfer learning from a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), and (2) Morgan molecular fingerprints (MFP) with a random forest (RF). Both methods using only molecule information as input achieved significantly better accuracy than previous work that used transcriptomic measurements of molecular effects. Because these data suggest that much of a molecules function is encoded by its chemical structure, we explore which general molecular properties are drug class-specific and how misclassification of structures might provide drug repurposing opportunities.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSynapses are essential to neural signal transmission. Therefore, quantification of synapses and related neurites from images is vital to gain insights into the underlying pathways of brain functionality and diseases. Despite the wide availability of synapse imaging data, several issues prevent satisfactory quantification of these structures by current tools. First, the antibodies used for labeling synapses are not perfectly specific to synapses. These antibodies may exist in neurites or other cell compartments. Second, the brightness for different neurites and synapses is heterogeneous due to the variation of antibody concentration and synapse-intrinsic differences. Third, images often have low signal to noise ratio (SNR) due to constraints of experiments and availability of sensitive antibodies. The combination of these issues makes the detection of synapses challenging and necessitates developing a new tool to accurately and reliably quantify synapses.\n\nResultsWe present an automatic probability-principled synapse detection algorithm and integrate it into our synapse quantification tool SynQuant. Derived from the theory of order statistics, our method controls the false discovery rate and improves the power of detecting synapses. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real images in the presence of severe antibody diffusion, high heterogeneity, and large noise, our method was demonstrated to outperform peer specialized synapse detection tools as well as generic spot detection methods by a large margin. Finally, we show SynQuant reliably uncovers statistically significant differences between disease and control conditions in a neuron-astrocyte co-culture based model of Down Syndrome.\n\nAvailabilityThe Java source code, Fiji plug-in, and test data are available at https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/SynQuant.\n\nContactyug@vt.edu",

    "abstract": "Protein methylation has been implicated in many important biological contexts including signaling, metabolism, and transcriptional control. Despite the importance of this post-translational modification, the global analysis of protein methylation by mass spectrometry-based proteomics has not been extensively studied due to the lack of robust, well-characterized techniques for methyl peptide enrichment. Here, to better investigate protein methylation, we optimized and compared two methods for methyl peptide enrichment: immunoaffinity purification (IAP) and high pH strong cation exchange (SCX). Comparison of these methods revealed that they are largely orthogonal for monomethyl arginine (MMA), suggesting that the usage of both techniques is required to provide a global view of protein methylation. Using both IAP and SCX, we investigated changes in protein methylation downstream of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) and quantified [~]1,000 methylation sites on 407 proteins. Of these methylation sites, PRMT1 knockdown resulted in significant changes to 97 arginine methylation sites on 59 proteins. In contrast, zero lysine methylation sites were significantly changed upon PRMT1 knockdown. In PRMT1 knockdown cells, 84 MMA sites were either significantly downregulated or upregulated. PRMT1 knockdown also induced significant changes in both asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethyl arginine (SDMA), suggesting that loss of PRMT1 activity allows scavenging of PRMT1 substrates by other PRMTs. Using neutral loss fragmentation ions unique to ADMA and SDMA, we annotated dimethylarginines as either ADMA or SDMA. Through integrative analysis of methyl forms, we identified 12 high confidence PRMT1 substrates, 43 putative PRMT1 substrates, and 17 methylation sites that are scavenged by other non-PRMT1 arginine methyltransferases in the absence of PRMT1 activity. Taken together, our results suggest that deep protein methylation profiling by mass spectrometry requires orthogonal enrichment techniques to identify novel PRMT1 methylation targets and highlight the dynamic interplay between methyltransferases in mammalian cells.",

The computational methods have not kept up with the deluge of data and need for real-time results.\n\nWe have therefore created a bioinformatics pipeline for rapid subtyping and continuous phylogenomic analysis of bacterial samples, suited for large-scale surveillance. To decrease the computational burden, a two level clustering strategy is employed. The data is first divided into sets by matching each isolate to a closely related reference genome. The reads then are aligned to the reference to gain a consensus sequence and SNP based genetic distance is calculated between the sequences in each set. Isolates are clustered together with a threshold of 10 SNPs. Finally, phylogenetic trees are inferred from the non-redundant sequences and the clustered isolates are placed on a clade with the cluster representative sequence. The method was benchmarked and found to be accurate in grouping outbreak strains together, while discriminating from non-outbreak strains.\n\nThe pipeline was applied in Evergreen Online, which processes publicly available sequencing data from foodborne bacterial pathogens on a daily basis, updating the phylogenetic trees as needed.

Human affective touch is critical for healthy child development and shows great promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for mental disorders characterized by social dysfunction, such as anxiety, depression and autism spectrum disorder. However, despite our detailed knowledge about cortical processing of non-social touch, we still know very little about how social touch modulates cortical circuits. We investigated the activity patterns of single neurons (N = 1156) across five sensory and frontal cortical areas in both male and female rats (N = 28) engaging in naturalistic social facial touch with male and female conspecifics. We found that information about social touch is widely available across cortex. Besides touch, the sex of the interaction partner (a biologically significant feature) is a major determinant of single neuron activity, and across cortex we observed 25.7%  touch and 11.9%  sex-touch responses. Although all areas investigated had access to social touch and partner sex information, social touch modulated different cortical areas in different ways. Finally, we found that network activity patterns during social touch depend on both subject sex and partner sex. Interestingly, these sex-differences in network activity patterns were differences in response magnitude and would not be evident without single cell resolution. Our observations suggest that socio-sexual characteristics of touch (subject and partner sex) widely modulate cortical activity and need to be investigated with cellular resolution.",

As a proof of concept, we present a workflow for multidimensional Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) and data processing with open source computational tools. CellProfiler was used to identify single cells through establishing cellular boundaries, followed by histoCAT (histology topography cytometry analysis toolbox) for extracting single-cell quantitative information visualized as t-SNE plots and heatmaps.

Predicted pharmacodynamic effects were measured in MCF-7 cells dosed with three target-specific compounds: growth stimulatory EGF, microtubule depolymerization agent nocodazole and genotoxic chemotherapeutic drug etoposide. We show strong pairwise correlation between nuclear markers pHistone3S28, Ki-67 and p4E-BP1T37/T46 in classified mitotic cells and anti-correlation with cell surface markers.

    "abstract": "Males and females feature strikingly different phenotypes, despite sharing most of their genome. The resolution of this apparent paradox is through differential gene expression, whereby genes are expressed at different levels in each sex. This resolution, however, is likely to be incomplete, leading to conflict between males and females over the optimal expression of genes. We test the hypothesis that gene expression in females is constrained from evolving to its optimum level due to sexually antagonistic selection on males, by examining changes sex-biased gene expression in five obligate asexual species of stick insect, which do not produce males. We predicted that the transcriptome of asexual females would be feminized as asexual females do not experience any sexual conflict. Contrary to our prediction we find that asexual females feature masculinized gene expression, and hypothesise that this is due to shifts in female optimal gene expression levels following the suppression of sex.",

    "abstract": "Nearby grid cells have been observed to express a remarkable degree of long-range order, which is often idealized as extending potentially to infinity. Yet their strict periodic firing and ensemble coherence are theoretically possible only in flat environments, much unlike the burrows which rodents usually live in. Are the symmetrical, coherent grid maps inferred in the lab relevant to chart their way in their natural habitat?\n\nWe consider spheres as simple models of curved environments and, waiting for the appropriate experiments to be performed, we use our adaptation model to predict what grid maps would emerge in a network with the same recurrent connections, which on the plane produce coherence among the units. We find that on the sphere such connections distort the maps that single grid units would express on their own, and aggregate them into clusters. When remapping to a different spherical environment, units in each cluster maintain only partial coherence, similar to what is observed in disordered materials, such as spin glasses.",

    "abstract": "A central function of the brain is to plan, predict and imagine the effect of movement in a dynamically changing environment. Here we show that in mice head fixed in a plus-maze, floating on air, and trained to pick lanes based on visual stimuli, the asymmetric movement and position of whiskers on the two sides of the face signals whether the animal is moving, turning, expecting reward or licking. We show that 1) we can decode and predict the behavioral state of the animal based on this asymmetry, 2) that tactile input from whiskers indicates little about the behavioral state, and 3) that movement of the nose correlates with asymmetry, indicating that facial expression of the mouse is itself correlated with behavioral state. Amazingly, the movement of whiskers - a behavior that is not instructed or necessary in the task--informs an observer about what a mouse is doing in the maze. Thus, these mobile tactile sensors reflect a behavioral and movement-preparation state of the mouse.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeAccurate identification of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patient cohorts is essential for a wide range of clinical investigations. Automated phenotyping methods that leverage electronic health records (EHRs) represent a fundamentally new approach cohort identification. Unfortunately, the current generation of these algorithms is laborious to develop, poorly generalize between institutions, and rely on incomplete information. We systematically compared and evaluated the ability of several machine learning algorithms and case-control combinations to phenotype acute ischemic stroke patients using data from an EHR.\\n\\nMethodsUsing structured patient data from the EHR at a tertiary-care hospital system, we built machine learning models to identify patients with AIS based on 75 different case-control and classifier combinations. We then determined the models classification ability for AIS on an internal validation set, and estimated the prevalence of AIS patients across the EHR. Finally, we externally validated the ability of the models to detect self-reported AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes using the UK Biobank.\\n\\nResultsAcross all models, we found that the mean area under the receiver operating curve for detecting AIS was 0.963{+/-}0.0520 and average precision score 0.790{+/-}0.196 with minimal feature processing. Logistic regression classifiers with L1 penalty gave the best performance. Classifiers trained with cases with AIS diagnosis codes and controls with no cerebrovascular disease diagnosis codes had the best average F1 score (0.832{+/-}0.0383). In the external validation, we found that the top probabilities from a model-predicted AIS cohort were significantly enriched for self-reported AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes (65-250 fold over expected).\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings support machine learning algorithms as a way to accurately identify AIS patients without relying on diagnosis codes or using process-intensive manual feature curation. When a set of AIS patients is unavailable, diagnosis codes may be used to train classifier models. Our approach is potentially generalizable to other academic institutions and further external validation is needed.",

    "abstract": "The genomewide signal profiles from functional genomics experiments are dense information sources for annotating the regulatory elements. These profiles measure epigenetic activity at the nucleotide resolution and they exhibit distinct patterns along the genome. Most notable of these patterns are the valley patterns that are prevalently observed in many epigenetic assays such as ChIP-Seq and bisulfite sequencing. Valleys mark locations of cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers. Systematic identification of the valleys provides novel information for delineating the annotation of regulatory elements using epigenetic data. Nevertheless, the valleys are generally not reported by analysis pipelines. Here, we describe EpiSAFARI, a computational method for sensitive detection of valleys from diverse types of epigenetic profiles. EpiSAFARI employs a novel smoothing method for decreasing noise in signal profiles and accounts for technical factors such as sparse signals, mappability, and nucleotide content. In performance comparisons, EpiSAFARI performs favorably in terms of accuracy. The histone modification and DNA methylation valleys detected by EpiSAFARI exhibit high conservation, transcription factor binding, and they are enriched in nascent transcription. In addition, the large clusters of histone valleys are found to be enriched at the promoters of the developmentally associated genes.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are predicted to play an important role in the evolution of host mating strategies, and vice versa, yet our understanding of host-STI coevolution is limited. Here, I present a model of acute STI infection in populations with ephemeral mating dynamics, where hosts evolve their preference for healthy mates and STIs evolve mortality or sterility virulence. Mate choice readily evolves even though ephemeral mating and acute infections reduce the advantages of mate choice compared to previous theory based on serial monogamy and chronic infections. Selection for mate choice constrains both mortality and sterility virulence, leading to optimal strategies in each population, host polymorphism, or fluctuating selection. I show how the mode of virulence, costs associated with mate choice, recovery, and host lifespan impact on host-STI coevolution, with fluctuating selection most likely when hosts have intermediate lifespans, STIs cause sterility and longer infections, and costs of mate choice are not too high. The results reveal new insights into the evolution of mate choice and how coevolution unfolds for different host and STI life-history traits, providing increased support for parasite-mediated sexual selection as a potential driver of host mate choice, and mate choice as a constraint on STI virulence.",

Angling is expected to induce mortality on fish with bold and explorative behavior, which are behaviors commonly linked to a high standard metabolic rate. We studied the transgenerational response of brown trout (Salmo trutta) to angling-induced selection by examining the behavior and metabolism of 1-year-old parr between parents that were or were not captured by experimental fly fishing. We performed the angling selection experiment on both a wild and a captive population, and compared the offspring for standard metabolic rate and behavior under predation risk in common garden conditions. Angling had population-specific effects on risk taking and exploration tendency, but no effects on standard metabolic rate. Our study adds to the evidence that angling can induce transgenerational responses on fish personality. However, understanding the mechanisms of divergent responses between the populations requires further study on the selectivity of angling in various conditions.",

    "abstract": "Prolonging the clinical effectiveness of {beta}-lactams, which remain first-line antibiotics for many infections, is an important part of efforts to address antimicrobial resistance. We report here that inactivation of the predicted D-cycloserine (DCS) transporter gene cycA re-sensitized MRSA to {beta}-lactam antibiotics. The cycA mutation also resulted in hyper-susceptibility to DCS, an alanine analogue antibiotic that inhibits alanine racemase and D-alanine ligase required for D-alanine incorporation into cell wall peptidoglycan (PG). Alanine transport was impaired in the cycA mutant and this correlated with increased susceptibility to oxacillin and DCS. The cycA mutation or exposure to DCS were both associated with the accumulation of muropeptides with tripeptide stems lacking the terminal D-ala-D-ala and reduced PG crosslinking, prompting us to investigate synergism between {beta}-lactams and DCS. DCS re-sensitised MRSA to {beta}-lactams in vitro and significantly enhanced MRSA eradication by oxacillin in a mouse bacteraemia model. These findings reveal alanine transport as a new therapeutic target to enhance the susceptibility of MRSA to {beta}-lactam antibiotics.",

Biomarkers are typically identified by correlating biological measurements with the status of a condition in a sample of subjects. Cross-sectional studies sample subjects at a single timepoint, while longitudinal studies follow a cohort through time. Identifying biomarkers of aging is subject to unique challenges. Individuals who age faster have intrinsically higher mortality rates and so are preferentially lost over time, in a phenomenon known as cohort selection. In this paper, we use simulations to show that cohort selection biases cross-sectional analysis away from identifying causal loci of aging, to the point where cross-sectional studies are less likely to identify loci that cause aging than if loci had been chosen at random. We go on to show this bias can be corrected by incorporating correlates of mortality identified from longitudinal studies, allowing cross sectional studies to effectively identify the causal factors of aging.",

Here, we report the results of a Dutch genome wide association study (GWAS) of an in-house developed lipidomics platform, focusing on 90 plasma lipids. Lipids were assessed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in participants from the Leiden Longevity Study, the Netherlands Twin Register and the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study and meta-analysed, resulting in a sample size of 5537 participants. In addition, we performed genetic correlation analyses between the 90 plasma lipids and markers of metabolic health, as well as vascular pathology and CVD combining our GWAS results with publicly available GWAS outputs. We replicated previously known associations between 34 lipids and 10 lipid quantitative trait loci (lipQTL) (GCKR, APOA1, FADS1, SGPP1,TMEM229B, LIPC, PDXDC1, CETP, CERS4 and SPTLC3) with metabolome-wide (P < 1.61 x 10-9) significance. Moreover, we report 6 novel phospholipid-related and 5 triglyceride (TG)-related loci: SGGP1 (SM21:0), SPTLC3 (SM21:0 and SM25:1), FADS1 (LPCO16:1, PC38:2, PEO36:5, PEO38:5, TG56:5, TG56:6, and TG56:7), TMEM229 (LPCO16:1), GCKR (TG50:2), and APOA1 (TG54:4).

Genetic correlation analysis indicates that one specific specific sphingomyelin, SM22:0, shares common genetic background with CVD. Levels of SM22:0 also positively associate with carotid artery intima-media thickness in the ERF study, and this observation is independent of LDL-C level.

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation and progression of mitosis. More than 10,000 phosphorylated residues and the associated kinases have been identified to date via proteomic analyses. Although some of these phosphosites are associated with regulation of either protein-protein interactions or the catalytic activity of the substrate protein, the roles of most mitotic phosphosites remain unclear. In this study, we examined structural properties of mitotic phosphosites and neighboring residues to understand the role of heavy phosphorylation in non-structured domains. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of mitosis-arrested and non-arrested HeLa cells revealed >4,100 and >2,200 residues either significantly phosphorylated or dephosphorylated, respectively, at mitotic entry. The calculated disorder scores of amino acid sequences of neighboring individual phosphosites revealed that >70% of dephosphorylated phosphosites exist in disordered regions, whereas 50% of phosphorylated sites exist in non-structured domains. A clear inverse correlation was observed between probability of phosphorylation in non-structured domain and increment of phosphorylation in mitosis. These results indicate that at entry to mitosis, a significant number of phosphate groups are removed from non-structured domains and transferred to more-structured domains. Gene ontology term analysis revealed that mitosis-related proteins are heavily phosphorylated, whereas RNA-related proteins are both dephosphorylated and phosphorylated, suggesting that heavy phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in non-structured domains of RNA-binding proteins plays a role in dynamic rearrangement of RNA-containing organelles, as well as other intracellular environments.\\n\\nSignificance StatementProgression of mitosis is tightly regulated by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Although proteomic studies have identified tens of thousands of phosphosites in mitotic cells, the roles of them remain to be answered. We approached this question from the viewpoint of the higher-order structure of phosphosites. Quantitative proteomics and bioinformatic analyses revealed that more than 70% of mitotic dephosphorylation events occurred in non-structured regions. Non-structured regions of cellular proteins are attracting considerable attention in terms of their involvement in dynamic rearrangements of intracellular membrane-less organelles and protein assembly/disassembly processes. Our results suggest the possibility that a vast amount of mitosis-associated dephosphorylation/phosphorylation at non-structured regions plays a role in regulating the dynamic assembly/disassembly of intracellular architectures and organelles such as chromosomes and nucleolus.",

    "abstract": "Human social behaviour is complex, and the biological and neural mechanisms underpinning it remain debated1,2. A particularly interesting social phenomenon is our ability and tendency to fall into synchrony with other humans3,4. Our ability to coordinate actions and goals relies on the ability to distinguish between and integrate self and other, which when impaired can lead to devastating consequences. Interpersonal synchronization has been a widely used framework for studying action coordination and self-other integration, showing that in simple interactions, such as joint finger tapping, complex interpersonal dynamics emerge. Here we propose a computational model of self-other integration via within- and between-person action-perception links, implemented as a simple Kuramoto model with four oscillators. The model abstracts each member of a dyad as a unit consisting of two connected oscillators, representing intrinsic processes of perception and action. By fitting this model to data from two separate experiments we show that interpersonal synchronization strategies rely on the relationship between within- and between-unit coupling. Specifically, mutual adaptation exhibits a higher between-unit coupling than within-unit coupling; leading-following requires that the follower unit has a low within-unit coupling; and leading-leading occurs when two units jointly exhibit a low between-unit coupling. These findings are consistent with the theory of interpersonal synchronization emerging through self-other integration mediated by processes of action-perception coupling4. Hence, our results show that chaotic human behaviour occurring on a millisecond scale can be modelled using coupled oscillators.",

    "abstract": "Aging varies among individuals due to both genetics and environment but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using a highly recombined Saccharomyces cerevisiae population, we found 30 distinct Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) that control chronological life span (CLS) in calorie rich and calorie restricted environments, and under rapamycin exposure. Calorie restriction and rapamycin extended life span in virtually all genotypes, but through different genetic variants. We tracked the two major QTLs to massive expansions of intragenic tandem repeats in the cell wall glycoproteins FLO11 and HPF1, which caused a dramatic life span shortening. Life span impairment by N-terminal HPF1 repeat expansion was partially buffered by rapamycin but not by calorie restriction. The HPF1 repeat expansion shifted yeast cells from a sedentary to a buoyant state, thereby increasing their exposure to surrounding oxygen. The higher oxygenation perturbed methionine, lipid, and purine metabolism, which likely explains the life span shortening. We conclude that fast evolving intragenic repeat expansions can fundamentally change the relationship between cells and their environment with profound effects on cellular life style and longevity.",

    "abstract": "Despite a very effective vaccine, active conflict and community distrust during the ongoing DRC Ebola epidemic are undermining control efforts, including a ring vaccination strategy that requires the prompt immunization of close contacts of infected individuals. However, in April 2019, it was reported 20% or more of close contacts cannot be reached or refuse vaccination [1], and it is predicted that the ring vaccination strategy would not be effective with such a high level of inaccessibility [2]. The vaccination strategy is now incorporating a \"third ring\" community-level vaccination that targets members of communities even if they are not known contacts of Ebola cases. To assess the impact of vaccination strategies for controlling Ebola epidemics in the context of variable levels of community accessibility, we employed an individual-level stochastic transmission model that incorporates four sources of heterogeneity: a proportion of the population is inaccessible for contact tracing and vaccination due to lack of confidence in interventions or geographic inaccessibility, two levels of population mixing resembling household and community transmission, two types of vaccine doses with different time periods until immunity, and transmission rates that depend on spatial distance. Our results indicate that a ring vaccination strategy alone would not be effective for containing the epidemic in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts even for low levels of household inaccessibility and affirm the positive impact of a supplemental community vaccination strategy. Our key results are that as levels of inaccessibility increase, there is a qualitative change in the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy. For higher levels of vaccine access, the probability that the epidemic will end steadily increases over time, even if probabilities are lower than they would be otherwise with full community participation. For levels of vaccine access that are too low, however, the vaccination strategies are not expected to be successful in ending the epidemic even though they help lower incidence levels, which saves lives, and makes the epidemic easier to contain and reduces spread to other communities. This qualitative change occurs for both types of vaccination strategies: ring vaccination is effective for containing an outbreak until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 10% in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts, a combined ring and community vaccination strategy is effective until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 50%. More broadly, our results underscore the need to enhance community engagement to public health interventions in order to enhance the effectiveness of control interventions to ensure outbreak containment.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the context of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in DRC, active conflict and community distrust are undermining control efforts, including vaccination strategies. In this paper, we employed an individual-level stochastic structured transmission model to assess the impact of vaccination strategies on epidemic control in the context of variable levels of household inaccessibility. We found that a ring vaccination strategy of close contacts would not be effective for containing the epidemic in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts even for low levels of household inaccessibility and evaluate the impact of a supplemental community vaccination strategy.

However, all platforms proposed so far suffer from high cost, read-write latency and error-rates that render them noncompetitive with modern optical and magnetic storage devices. One means to avoid synthesizing DNA and to reduce the system error-rates is to use readily available native DNA. As the symbol/nucleotide content of native DNA is fixed, one may adopt an alternative recording strategy that modifies the DNA topology to encode desired information. Here, we report the first macromolecular storage paradigm in which data is written in the form of \"nicks (punches)\" at predetermined positions on the sugar-phosphate backbone of native dsDNA. The platform accommodates parallel nicking on multiple \"orthogonal\" genomic DNA fragments and paired nicking and disassociation for creating \"toehold\" regions that enable single-bit random access and strand displacement in-memory computations. As a proof of concept, we used the programmable restriction enzyme Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute to punch two files into the PCR products of Escherichia coli genomic DNA. The encoded data is accurately reconstructed through high-throughput sequencing and read alignment.",

    "abstract": "The dose dependent depletion of ovarian Ascorbic acid (AA) in rat ovaries, has been used as a bioassay for measurement of Luteinizing Hormone (LH). However, the mechanism of action of gonadotropin (LH, FSH) on ascorbic acid depletion is not completely clear in biochemical terms. To elucidate the mechanism, we looked for the pathways; one, where L-Gulonate Dehydrogenase (L-GuDH) catalyzes the conversion of L-Gulonic acid (L-GuA) to L-Xylulose, and, in the second the pathway conversion of L-GuA to AA, in a cats, dogs and Rats. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme L-GuDH in vitro showed the inhibitory effect of AA on L-GuDH. Therefore, we hypothesized that gonadotropins (FSH and LH) may regulate the L-GuDH maintain level of AA in ovary. LH administration to super-ovulated immature female rats caused depletion of ovarian AA but did not result in any change in the specific activity of the ovarian L-GuDH. Further, we administrated a surrogate FSH like hormone (PMSG) to immature female rats which, resulted in increased specific activity of ovarian L-GuDH. However, microarray data on RNA from ovaries exposed to FSH like hormone such as Pregnant Mare serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) did not reveal any increased expression of L-GuDH transcript. It is therefore concluded from the results obtained that; that neither LH, in decreasing the ovarian AA, nor FSH, in increasing the ovarian AA do so by regulating the activity of enzyme L-GuDH at transcriptional level. The results obtained have also been discussed by giving emphasis on the mechanism of ovarian ascorbic acid regulation of LH and FSH.",

    "abstract": "The first cell fate decisions in the developing fly embryo are made very rapidly: hunchback genes decide in a few minutes whether a given nucleus follows the anterior or the posterior developmental blueprint by reading out the positional information encoded in the Bicoid morphogen. This developmental system constitutes a prototypical instance of the broad spectrum of regulatory decision processes that combine speed and accuracy. Traditional arguments based on fixed-time sampling of Bicoid concentration indicate that an accurate readout is not possible within the short times observed experimentally. This raises the general issue of how speed-accuracy tradeoffs are achieved. Here, we compare fixed-time sampling strategies to decisions made on-the-fly, which are based on updating and comparing the likelihoods of being at an anterior or a posterior location. We found that these more efficient schemes can complete reliable cell fate decisions even within the very short embryological timescales. We discuss the influence of promoter architectures on the mean decision time and decision error rate and present concrete promoter architectures that allow for the fast readout of the morphogen. Lastly, we formulate explicit predictions for new experiments involving Bicoid mutants.",

    "abstract": "Deep feedforward neural network models of vision dominate in both computational neuroscience and engineering. The primate visual system, by contrast, contains abundant recurrent connections. Recurrent signal flow enables recycling of limited computational resources over time, and so might boost the performance of a physically finite brain or model. Here we show: (1) Recurrent convolutional neural network models outperform feedforward convolutional models matched in their number of parameters in large-scale visual recognition tasks on natural images. (2) Setting a confidence threshold, at which recurrent computations terminate and a decision is made, enables flexible trading of speed for accuracy. At a given confidence threshold, the model expends more time and energy on images that are harder to recognise, without requiring additional parameters for deeper computations. (3) The recurrent models reaction time for an image predicts the human reaction time for the same image better than several parameter-matched and state-of-the-art feedforward models. (4) Across confidence thresholds, the recurrent model emulates the behaviour of feedforward control models in that it achieves the same accuracy at approximately the same computational cost (mean number of floating-point operations). However, the recurrent model can be run longer (higher confidence threshold) and then outperforms parameter-matched feedforward comparison models. These results suggest that recurrent connectivity, a hallmark of biological visual systems, may be essential for understanding the accuracy, flexibility, and dynamics of human visual recognition.\n\nAuthor summaryDeep neural networks provide the best current models of biological vision and achieve the highest performance in computer vision. Inspired by the primate brain, these models transform the image signals through a sequence of stages, leading to recognition. Unlike brains in which outputs of a given computation are fed back into the same computation, these models do not process signals recurrently. The ability to recycle limited neural resources by processing information recurrently could explain the accuracy and flexibility of biological visual systems, which computer vision systems cannot yet match. Here we report that recurrent processing can improve recognition performance compared to similarly complex feedforward networks. Recurrent processing also enabled models to behave more flexibly and trade off speed for accuracy. Like humans, the recurrent network models can compute longer when an object is hard to recognise, which boosts their accuracy. The models recognition times predicted human recognition times for the same images. The performance and flexibility of recurrent neural network models illustrates that modeling biological vision can help us improve computer vision.",

In Caulobacter crescentus, the HHK ShkA is essential for accurate timing of the G1-S cell cycle transition and is regulated by the corresponding increase in the level of the second messenger c-di-GMP. Here, we use a combination of X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, functional analyses and kinetic modelling to reveal the regulatory mechanism of ShkA. In the absence of c-di-GMP, ShkA predominantly adopts a compact domain arrangement that is catalytically inactive. C-di-GMP binds to the dedicated pseudo-receiver domain Rec1 thereby liberating the canonical Rec2 domain from its central position where it obstructs the large-scale motions required for catalysis. Thus, c-di-GMP cannot only stabilize domain interactions, but also engage in domain dissociation to allosterically control activity.

    "abstract": "Many Gram-negative plant and animal pathogenic bacteria employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to secrete protein effectors into the cells of their hosts and promote disease. The plant pathogen Acidovorax citrulli requires a functional T3SS for pathogenicity. As with Xanthomonas and Ralstonia spp., an AraC-type transcriptional regulator, HrpX, regulates expression of genes encoding T3SS components and type III-secreted effectors (T3Es) in A. citrulli. A previous study reported eleven T3E genes in this pathogen, based on the annotation of a sequenced strain. We hypothesized that this was an underestimation. Guided by this hypothesis, we aimed at uncovering the T3E arsenal of the A. citrulli model strain, M6. We carried out a thorough sequence analysis searching for similarity to known T3Es from other bacteria. This analysis revealed 51 A. citrulli genes whose products are similar to known T3Es. Further, we combined machine learning and transcriptomics to identify novel T3Es. The machine learning approach ranked all A. citrulli M6 genes according to their propensity to encode T3Es. RNA-Seq revealed differential gene expression between wild-type M6 and a mutant defective in HrpX. Data combined from these approaches led to the identification of seven novel T3E candidates, that were further validated using a T3SS-dependent translocation assay. These T3E genes encode hypothetical proteins, do not show any similarity to known effectors from other bacteria, and seem to be restricted to plant pathogenic Acidovorax species. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that two of these T3Es localize to the cell nucleus and one interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum. This study not only uncovered the arsenal of T3Es of an important pathogen, but it also places A. citrulli among the \\\"richest\\\" bacterial pathogens in terms of T3E cargo. It also revealed novel T3Es that appear to be involved in the pathoadaptive evolution of plant pathogenic Acidovorax species.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAcidovorax citrulli is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes bacterial fruit blotch (BFB) disease of cucurbits. This disease represents a serious threat to cucurbit crop production worldwide. Despite the agricultural importance of BFB, the knowledge about basic aspects of A. citrulli-plant interactions is rather limited. As many Gram-negative plant and animal pathogenic bacteria, A. citrulli employs a complex secretion system, named type III secretion system, to deliver protein virulence effectors into the host cells. In this work we aimed at uncovering the arsenal of type III-secreted effectors (T3Es) of this pathogen by combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches. We found that this bacterium possesses at least 51 genes that are similar to T3E genes from other pathogenic bacteria. In addition, our study revealed seven novel T3Es that seem to occur only in A. citrulli strains and in other plant pathogenic Acidovorax species. We found that two of these T3Es localize to the plant cell nucleus while one partially interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum. Further characterization of the novel T3Es identified in this study may uncover new host targets of pathogen effectors and new mechanisms by which pathogenic bacteria manipulate their hosts.",

    "abstract": "USP5 disassembles unanchored polyubiquitin chains to recycle free mono-ubiquitin, and is one of twelve ubiquitin-specific proteases featuring a zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF-UBD). This distinct structural module has been associated with substrate positioning or allosteric modulation of catalytic activity, but its cellular function remains unclear. We screened a chemical library focused on the ZnF-UBD of USP5, crystallized hits in complex with the protein, and generated a preliminary structure-activity relationship which enables the development of more potent and selective compounds. This work serves as a framework for the discovery of a chemical probe to delineate the function of USP5 ZnF-UBD in proteasomal degradation and other ubiquitin signalling pathways in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Optimal prevention and treatment strategies for a disease of multiple causes, such as pneumonia, must be informed by the population distribution of causes among cases, or cause-specific case fractions (CSCFs). CSCFs may further depend on additional explanatory variables. Existing methodological literature in disease etiology research does not fully address the regression problem, particularly under a case-control design. Based on multivariate binary non-gold-standard diagnostic data and additional covariate information, this paper proposes a novel and unified regression modeling framework for estimating covariate-dependent CSCF functions in case-control disease etiology studies. The model leverages critical control data for valid probabilistic cause assignment for cases.We derive an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for flexible posterior inference. We illustrate the inference of CSCF functions using extensive simulations and show that the proposed model produces less biased estimates and more valid inference of the overall CSCFs than analyses that omit covariates. A regression analysis of pediatric pneumonia data reveals the dependence of CSCFs upon season, age, HIV status and disease severity. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on model extensions that may further enhance the utility of the regression model in disease etiology research.",

    "abstract": "The Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) is a midbrain region implicated in a variety of motivated behaviors. However, the function of VTA GABAergic (Vgat+) neurons remains poorly understood. Here, using 3D motion capture, in vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we demonstrate a novel function of VTAVgat+ neurons. We found three distinct populations of neurons, each representing head angle about a principal axis of rotation: pitch, roll, and yaw. For each axis, opponent cell groups were found that increase firing when the head moves in one direction, and decrease firing in the opposite direction. Selective excitation and inhibition of VTAVgat+ neurons generate opposite rotational movements. The relationship between these neurons and head angle is degraded only at the time of reward consumption, at which point all head-angle related neuronal subpopulations show indistinguishable reward-related responses. Thus, VTAVgat+ neurons serve a critical role in the control of rotational kinematics while pursuing a moving target. This general-purpose steering function can guide animals toward desired spatial targets in any motivated behavior.",

    "abstract": "How temporal cues combine with spatial inputs to control gene expression during development is poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that the Drosophila transcription factor E93 controls temporal gene expression by regulating chromatin accessibility. Precocious expression of E93 early in wing development reveals that it can simultaneously activate and deactivate different target enhancers. Notably, the precocious patterns of enhancer activity resemble the wild-type patterns that occur later in development, suggesting that provision of E93 alters the competence of enhancers to respond to spatial cues. Genomic profiling reveals that precocious E93 expression is sufficient to regulate chromatin accessibility at a subset of its targets. These accessibility changes mimic those that normally occur later in development, indicating that precocious E93 accelerates the wild-type developmental program. Further, we find that target enhancers that do not respond to precocious E93 in early wings become responsive after a developmental transition, suggesting that parallel temporal pathways work alongside E93. These findings support a model wherein E93 expression functions as an instructive cue that defines a broad window of developmental time through control of chromatin accessibility.",

    "abstract": "Growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious global threat to human health. Current methods to detect resistance include phenotypic antibiotic sensitivity testing (AST) which measures bacterial growth and is therefore hampered by slow time to result (~12-24 hours). Therefore new rapid phenotypic methods for AST are urgently needed. Nanomechanical cantilever sensors have recently shown promise for rapid AST but challenges of bacterial immobilization can lead to variable results. Herein a novel cantilever-based method is described for detecting phenotypic antibiotic resistance within ~45 minutes, capable of detecting single bacteria. This method does not require complex, variable bacterial immobilization, and instead uses the laser and detector system to detect single bacterial cells in media as they pass through the laser focus. This provides a simple read out of bacterial antibiotic resistance by detecting growth (resistant) or death (sensitive), much faster than current methods. The potential of this technique demonstrated by determining resistance in both lab and clinical strains of E. coli, a key species for clinically burdensome urinary tract infections. This work provides the basis for a simple and fast diagnostic tool to detect antibiotic resistance in bacteria, reducing the health and economic burdens of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}), a hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD), is associated with synchronous hyperactivity and dysregulated Ca2+ signaling in hippocampal astrocytes. However, the consequences of altered Ca2+ signaling on the temporal dynamics of Ca2+ and gliotransmitter release events at astrocytic microdomains are not known. We have developed a detailed biophysical model of microdomain signaling at a single astrocytic process that accurately describes key temporal features of Ca2+ events and Ca2+-mediated kiss-and-run and full fusion exocytosis. Using this model, we ask how aberrant plasma-membrane Ca2+ pumps and mGluR activity, molecular hallmarks of A{beta} toxicity that are also critically involved in Ca2+ signaling, modify astrocytic feedback at a tripartite synapse. We show that AD related molecular pathologies increase the rate and synchrony of Ca2+ and exocytotic events triggered by neuronal activity. Moreover, temporal precision between Ca2+ and release events, a mechanism indispensable for rapid modulation of synaptic transmission by astrocytes, is lost in AD astrocytic processes. Our results provide important evidence on the link between AD-related molecular pathology, dysregulated calcium signaling and gliotransmitter release at an astrocytic process.",

We find that upon hypoxia exposure, FOXO transcriptional activity is rapidly induced in both larvae and adults. Moreover, we see that foxo mutant animals show misregulated glucose metabolism in low oxygen and subsequently exhibit reduced hypoxia survival. We identify the innate immune transcription factor, NF-KappaB/Relish, as a key FOXO target in the control of hypoxia tolerance. We find that expression of Relish and its target genes are increase in a FOXO-dependent manner in hypoxia, and that relish mutant animals show reduced survival in hypoxia. Together, these data indicate that FOXO is a hypoxia inducible factor that mediates tolerance to low oxygen by inducing immune-like responses.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes with multiple small RNA pathways the mechanisms that channel RNAs within specific pathways are unclear. Here, we reveal the reactions that account for channeling in the siRNA biogenesis phase of the Arabidopsis RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. The process begins with template DNA transcription by NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV) whose atypical termination mechanism, induced by nontemplate DNA basepairing, channels transcripts to the associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RDR2. RDR2 converts Pol IV transcripts into double-stranded RNAs then typically adds an extra untemplated 3 terminal nucleotide to the second strands. The dicer endonuclease, DCL3 cuts resulting duplexes to generate 24 and 23nt siRNAs. The 23nt RNAs bear the untemplated terminal nucleotide of the RDR2 strand and are underrepresented among ARGONAUTE4-associated siRNAs. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insights into Pol IV termination, Pol IV-RDR2 coupling and RNA channeling from template DNA transcription to siRNA guide strand/passenger strand discrimination.",

Within the stem and progenitor cell compartment, Kat6b is most highly expressed in long-term (LT)-HSCs and is significantly decreased with aging at the transcript and protein levels. Knockdown of Kat6b in young LT-HSCs causes skewed production of myeloid cells both in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "S. pastorianus strains are hybrids of S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus that have been domesticated for several centuries in lager-beer brewing environments. As sequences and structures of S. pastorianus genomes are being resolved, molecular mechanisms and evolutionary origin of several industrially relevant phenotypes remain unknown. This study investigates how maltotriose metabolism, a key feature in brewing, may have arisen in early S. eubayanus x S. cerevisiae hybrids. To address this question, we generated a near-complete genome assembly of Himalayan S. eubayanus strains of the Holarctic subclade. This group of strains have been proposed to be the origin of the S. eubayanus subgenome of current S. pastorianus strains. The Himalayan S. eubayanus genomes harbored several copies of a SeAGT1 -oligoglucoside transporter gene with high sequence identity to genes encountered in S. pastorianus. Although Himalayan S. eubayanus strains are unable to grown on maltose and maltotriose, their maltose-hydrolase and SeMALT1 and SeAGT1 maltose-transporter genes complemented the corresponding null mutants of S. cerevisiae. Expression, in a Himalayan S. eubayanus strain, of a functional S. cerevisiae maltose-metabolism regulator gene (MALx3) enabled growth on oligoglucosides. The hypothesis that the maltotriose-positive phenotype in S. pastorianus is a result of heterosis was experimentally tested by constructing a S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus laboratory hybrid with a complement of maltose-metabolism genes that resembles that of current S. pastorianus strains. The ability of this hybrid to consume maltotriose in brewers wort demonstrated regulatory cross talk between sub-genomes and thereby validated this hypothesis. These results provide experimental evidence of the evolutionary origin of an essential phenotype of lager-brewing strains and valuable knowledge for industrial exploitation of laboratory-made S. pastorianus-like hybrids.\\n\\nImportanceS.pastorianus, a S.cerevisiae X S.eubayanus hybrid, is used for production of lager beer, the most produced alcoholic beverage worldwide It emerged by spontaneous hybridization and have colonized early lager-brewing processes. Despite accumulation and analysis of genome sequencing data of S.pastorianus parental genomes, the genetic blueprint of industrially relevant phenotypes remains unknown. Assimilation of wort abundant sugar maltotriose has been postulated to be inherited from S.cerevisiae parent. Here, we demonstrate that although Asian S.eubayanus isolates harbor a functional maltotriose transporter SeAGT1 gene, they are unable to grow on -oligoglucosides, but expression of S. cerevisae regulator ScMAL13 was sufficient to restore growth on trisaccharides. We hypothesized that S. pastorianus maltotriose phenotype results from regulatory interaction between S.cerevisae maltose transcription activator and the promoter of SeAGT1. We experimentally confirmed the heterotic nature of the phenotype and thus this results provide experimental evidence of the evolutionary origin of an essential phenotype of lager-brewing strains.",

For example, lysine acetylation in histone H4 is correlated with activation of RNA polymerase I-, II-, and III-driven transcription from chromatin templates, which requires prior chromatin remodeling. However, quantitative understanding of the contribution of particular PTM states to the sequential steps of eukaryotic transcription has been hampered partially because reconstitution of a chromatin template with designed PTMs is difficult. In this study, we reconstituted a di-nucleosome with site-specifically acetylated or unmodified histone H4, which contained two copies of the Xenopus somatic 5S rRNA gene with addition of a unique sequence detectable by hybridization-assisted fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Using a Xenopus oocyte nuclear extract, we analyzed the time course of accumulation of nascent 5S rRNA-derived transcripts generated on chromatin templates in vitro. Our mathematically described kinetic model and fitting analysis revealed that tetra-acetylation of histone H4 at K5/K8/K12/K16 increases the rate of transcriptionally competent chromatin formation ~3-fold in comparison with the absence of acetylation. We provide a kinetic model for quantitative evaluation of the contribution of epigenetic modifications to chromatin transcription.",

SCAP knockdown inhibited the turnover of PI4P perhaps due to a cholesterol transport defect and altered the subcellular distribution of the VAP/OSBP complex. As in the case of perturbation of lipid transfer complexes at ER-Golgi contact sites, SCAP knockdown inhibited the biogenesis of the trans-Golgi network-derived transport carriers CARTS, which was reversed by expression of wild-type SCAP but not cholesterol sensing-defective mutants. Altogether, our findings reveal a new role of SCAP under cholesterol-fed conditions in the facilitation of CARTS biogenesis at ER-Golgi contact sites, depending on the ER cholesterol.\n\nSummarySCAP is the key regulatory protein in cholesterol metabolism.

To further investigate the effects of different parameters on the biological activities of STAMPs, a peptide sequence, WKKIWKDPGIKKWIK, was truncated, extended, and provided with an increased charge and altered amphipathicity. In addition, a novel template modification method was introduced, in which a phage-displayed peptide that recognized and bound to E. coli cells was attached at the end of the sequence. Compared with the traditional template modification method, peptide 11, which contained a phage-displayed peptide at the C-terminus, exhibited superior narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity against E. coli compared to that of parental peptide 2, and the activity and specificity of 11 were increased by 5.0 and 2.4 times, respectively. Additionally, 11 showed low cell toxicity and relatively desirable salt, serum, acid and alkaline stability. In this study, 11 specifically killed E. coli by causing cytoplasmic membrane rupture and cytosol leakage. In summary, these findings are useful for improving the activity and specificity of STAMPs and show that peptide 11 is better able to combat the growing threat of E. coli infections.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPreserving microbial diversity in food systems is one of the many challenges to be met to achieve food security and quality. Although industrialization led to the selection and spread of specific fermenting microbial strains, there are still ongoing artisanal processes that may allow the conservation of a wider species diversity and genetic diversity. We examined whether the diversity of artisanal practices could lead to an increased level in fungal species diversity for bread making. We used an interdisciplinary participatory research approach including bakers, psycho-sociologists and microbiologists to analyze French bread making practices and describe fungal communities in naturally fermented sourdough of 27 bakers and 12 farmer bakers. Bread making practices were classified in two groups: the farmer-like practice group and the artisanal-like practice group. The well-known bakery yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was dominant (i.e. with a relative abundance over 50%) in only 24% of sourdoughs while other yeast species, belonging to the Kazachstania genus, were dominant in 54% of sourdoughs. Bread making practices were found to drive the distribution of fungal species across sourdoughs. The most striking bread making practice effect was the occurrence of Kazachstania humilis in sourdoughs made with artisanal-like practices and the occurrence of Kazachstania bulderi in sourdoughs made with farmer-like practices. Phenotypic divergences between sourdough and nonsourdough strains were found for K. humilis but not for K. bulderi. Overall, our results showed that preserving bread making practice diversity allows the preservation of a higher species and phenotypic diversity in microbial communities.",

Combining hybrid genome sequencing, RNA-Seq, and mass spectrometry of virion-associated proteins allowed us to accurately assemble and annotate PA5octs 286,783 bp genome. It encodes 461 coding regions, of which 93 were identified as virion-associated proteins using ESI-MS/MS. RNA-seq revealed twelve tRNA genes, four ncRNA regions, and a gradual take-over of the total cell transcriptome from 21% in early infection to 93% in late infection. Although PA5oct is not organized into strictly contiguous regions of temporal transcription, defined genomic regions are expressed in early, middle, and late phases of infection. Interestingly, we observed distinct regions showing limited transcription activity throughout the infection cycle. The infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by PA5oct triggers the upregulation of bacterial operons related to NAD biosynthesis, Psl exopolysaccharide, and periplasmic nitrate reductase production and downregulates Type IV pili gene products, suggesting mechanisms of superinfection exclusion. We used the proteome of PA5oct to position this isolate amongst other phages using a protein-sharing network. This study expands our understanding of the molecular diversity of jumbo viruses and opens new questions towards cellular regulation and phage-encoded hijacking mechanisms.",

Guided by the theory, we experimentally demonstrated spontaneous checkerboard patterning in an optogenetic setup where cell-to-cell signaling was emulated with light inputs calculated in silico from real-time gene expression measurements. The scheme successfully produced spontaneous, persistent checkerboard patterns for systems of sixteen patches, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions.

    "abstract": "Factors that influence the distribution, abundance, and diversification of species can simultaneously affect multiple evolutionary lineages within or across communities. These include changes to the environment or inter-specific ecological interactions that cause ranges of multiple species to contract, expand, or fragment. Such processes predict temporally clustered evolutionary events across species, such as synchronous population divergences and/or changes in population size. There have been a number of methods developed to infer shared divergences or changes in population size, but not both, and the latter has been limited to approximate methods. We introduce a full-likelihood Bayesian method that uses genomic data to estimate temporal clustering of an arbitrary mix of population divergences and population-size changes across taxa. Using simulated data, we find that estimating the timing and sharing of demographic changes tends to be inaccurate and sensitive to prior assumptions, which is in contrast to accurate, precise, and robust estimates of shared divergence times. We also show previous estimates of co-expansion among five Alaskan populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were likely driven by prior assumptions and ignoring invariant characters. We conclude by discussing potential avenues to improve the estimation of synchronous demographic changes across populations.",

This lack of broader standardization and the complexity of installing and maintaining NMR-related software creates a barrier of entry into the field.

To reduce the barrier for newcomers and to prevent deprecation of aging software, we have created the NMRdock container.

    "abstract": "Meningiomas account for one-third of all primary brain tumors. Although typically benign, about 20% of meningiomas are aggressive, and despite the rigor of the current histopathological classification system, there remains considerable uncertainty in predicting tumor behavior. Here, we analyzed 160 tumors from all three WHO grades (I-III) using clinical, gene expression and sequencing data. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified three molecular types (A, B, and C) that reliably predicted recurrence. These groups did not directly correlate with the WHO grading system, which would classify more than half of the tumors in the most aggressive molecular type as benign. Transcriptional and biochemical analyses revealed that aggressive meningiomas involve loss of the repressor function of the DREAM complex, which results in cell cycle activation; only tumors in this category tend to recur after full resection. These findings should improve our ability to predict recurrence and develop targeted treatments for these clinically challenging tumors.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMeningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Although most of these tumors are benign, one-fifth will recur despite apparently complete resection. Several studies have demonstrated that genomic approaches can yield important insights into the biology of these tumors. We performed RNA sequencing and whole-exome sequencing of 160 tumors from 140 patients, which identified three distinct groups of meningioma that correlate with recurrence better than the current WHO grading system. Our analysis also revealed that the most aggressive type was characterized by loss of the repressive DREAM complex. These findings should improve prognostication for patients and lead to viable therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional silencing at HML and HMR maintains mating-type identity. The repressive chromatin structure at these loci is replicated every cell cycle and must be re-established quickly to prevent transcription of the genes at these loci. Mutations in a component of the replisome, the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), encoded by POL30, cause a loss of transcriptional silencing at HMR. We used an assay that captures transient losses of silencing at HML and HMR to perform extended genetic analyses of the pol30-6, pol30-8, and pol30-79 alleles. All three alleles destabilized silencing only transiently and only in cycling cells. Whereas pol30-8 caused loss of silencing by disrupting the function of Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-I), pol30-6 and pol30-79 acted through a separate genetic pathway but one still dependent on histone chaperones. Surprisingly, the silencing-loss phenotypes depended on ploidy but not on POL30 dosage or mating-type identity. Separately from silencing loss, the pol30-6 and pol30-79 alleles also displayed high levels of mitotic recombination in diploids. These results established that histone trafficking involving PCNA at replication forks is crucial to the maintenance of chromatin state and genome stability during DNA replication. They also raised the possibility that increased ploidy may protect chromatin states when the replisome is perturbed.",

Localization is absolutely required for downstream molecular cell biology analysis of PTM function in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we developed PTMProphet, a free and open-source software tool integrated into the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, which reanalyzes identified spectra from any search engine for which pepXML output is available to provide localization confidence to enable appropriate further characterization of biologic events. Localization of any type of mass modification (e.g., phosphorylation) is supported. PTMProphet applies Bayesian mixture models to compute probabilities for each site/peptide spectrum match where a PTM has been identified. These probabilities can be combined to compute a global false localization rate at any threshold to guide downstream analysis. We describe the PTMProphet tool, its underlying algorithms and demonstrate its performance on ground-truth synthetic peptide reference datasets, one previously published small dataset, one new larger dataset, and also on a previously published phospho-enriched dataset where the correct sites of modification are unknown.

    "abstract": "Commissural interneurons (CINs) mediate interactions between rhythm-generating locomotor circuits located on each side of the spinal cord and are necessary for left-right limb coordination during locomotion. While glutamatergic V3 CINs have been implicated in left-right coordination, their functional connectivity remains elusive. Here, we addressed this issue by combining experimental and modeling approaches. We employed Sim1Cre/+; Ai32 mice, in which light-activated Channelrhodopsin-2 was selectively expressed in V3 interneurons. Fictive locomotor activity was evoked by NMDA and 5-HT in the isolated neonatal lumbar spinal cord. Flexor and extensor activities were recorded from left and right L2 and L5 ventral roots, respectively. Bilateral photoactivation of V3 interneurons increased the duration of extensor bursts resulting in a slowed down on-going rhythm. At high light intensities, extensor activity could become sustained. When light stimulation was shifted toward one side of the cord, the duration of extensor bursts still increased on both sides, but these changes were more pronounced on the contralateral side than on the ipsilateral side. Additional bursts appeared on the ipsilateral side not seen on the contralateral side. Further increase of the stimulation could suppress the contralateral oscillations by switching to a sustained extensor activity, while the ipsilateral rhythmic activity remained. To delineate the function of V3 interneurons and their connectivity, we developed a computational model of the spinal circuits consisting of two (left and right) rhythm generators (RGs) interacting via V0V, V0D and V3 CINs. Both types of V0 CINs provided mutual inhibition between the left and right flexor RG centers and promoted left-right alternation. V3 CINs mediated mutual excitation between the left and right extensor RG centers. These interactions allowed the model to reproduce our current experimental data, while being consistent with previous data concerning the role of V0V and V0D CINs in securing left-right alternation and the changes in left-right coordination following their selective removal. We suggest that V3 CINs provide mutual excitation between the spinal neurons involved in the control of left and right extensor activity, which may promote left-right synchronization during locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Apex predators are important indicators of intact natural ecosystems. They are also sensitive to urbanization because they require broad home ranges and extensive contiguous habitat to support their prey base. Pumas (Puma concolor) can persist near human developed areas, but urbanization may be detrimental to their movement ecology, population structure, and genetic diversity. To investigate potential effects of urbanization in population connectivity of pumas, we performed a landscape genomics study of 134 pumas on the rural Western Slope and more urbanized Front Range of Colorado, USA. Over 12,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped using double-digest, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). We investigated patterns of gene flow and genetic diversity, and tested for correlations between key landscape variables and genetic distance to assess the effects of urbanization and other landscape factors on gene flow. Levels of genetic diversity were similar for the Western Slope and Front Range, but effective population sizes were smaller, genetic distances were higher, and there was more overall population substructure in the more urbanized Front Range. Forest cover was strongly positively associated with puma gene flow on the Western Slope, while impervious surfaces restricted gene flow and more open, natural habitats enhanced gene flow on the Front Range. Landscape genomic analyses revealed differences in puma movement and gene flow patterns in rural versus urban settings. Our results highlight the utility of dense, genome-scale markers to document subtle impacts of urbanization on a wide-ranging carnivore living near a large urban center.",

    "abstract": "Accurate massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of genetic variants is key to many areas of science and medicine, such as cataloguing population genetic variation and diagnosing genetic diseases. Certain genomic positions can be prone to higher rates of systematic sequencing and alignment bias that limit accuracy, resulting in false positive variant calls. Current standard practices to differentiate between loci that can and cannot be sequenced with high confidence utilise consensus between different sequencing methods as a proxy for sequencing confidence. These practices have significant limitations and alternative methods are required to overcome these.\n\nWe have developed a novel statistical method based on summarising sequenced reads from whole genome clinical samples and cataloguing them in \"Incremental Databases\" that maintain individual confidentiality. Allele statistics were catalogued for each genomic position that consistently showed systematic biases with the corresponding MPS sequencing pipeline. We found systematic biases present at [~]1-3% of the human autosomal genome across five patient cohorts. We identified which genomic regions were more or less prone to systematic biases, including large homopolymer flanks (odds ratio=23.29-33.69) and the NIST high confidence genomic regions (odds ratio=0.154-0.191). We confirmed our predictions on a gold-standard reference genome and showed that these systematic biases can lead to suspect variant calls within clinical panels.\n\nOur results recommend increased caution to address systematic biases in whole genome sequencing and alignment. This study provides the implementation of a simple statistical approach to enhance quality control of clinically sequenced samples by flagging variants at suspect loci for further analysis or exclusion.",

    "abstract": "Amino acid starvation in Escherichia coli activates the enzymatic activity of the stringent factor RelA, leading to accumulation of the alarmone nucleotide (p)ppGpp. The alarmone acts as an intercellular messenger to regulate transcription, translation and metabolism to mediate bacterial stress adaptation. The enzymatic activity of RelA is subject to multi-layered allosteric control executed both by ligands - such as  starved ribosomal complexes, deacylated tRNA and pppGpp - and by individual RelA domains. The auto-regulation of RelA is proposed to act either in cis (inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the N-terminal region, NTD, by regulatory C-terminal region, CTD) or in trans (CTD-mediated dimerization leading to enzyme inhibition). In this report, we probed the regulatory roles of the individual domains of E. coli RelA and our results are not indicative of RelA dimerization being the key regulatory mechanism. First, at growth-permitting levels, ectopic expression of RelA CTD does not interfere with activation of native RelA, indicating lack of regulation via inhibitory complex formation in the cell. Second, in our biochemical assays, increasing RelA concentration does not decrease the enzyme activity, as would be expected in the case of efficient auto-inhibition via dimerization. Third, while high-level CTD expression efficiently inhibits the growth, the effect is independent of native RelA and is mediated by direct inhibition of protein synthesis, likely via direct interaction with the ribosomal A-site. Finally, deletion of the RRM domain of the CTD region leads to growth inhibition mediated by accumulation of (p)ppGpp, suggesting de-regulation of the synthetic activity in this mutant.",

    "abstract": "Plant-herbivore interactions are ubiquitous across nature and drive major agricultural losses. Inducible defense responses triggered through immune recognition aid in host plant protection; however, specific ligand-receptor pairs mediating the initial perception of herbivory remain unknown. Plants in the subtribe Phaseolinae detect herbivore-associated peptides in caterpillar oral secretions and the defined ligands are proteolytic fragments of chloroplastic ATP synthase termed inceptins. Using forward genetic mapping of inceptin-induced responses, we identify a cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein as an inceptin receptor (INR) sufficient for elicitor-induced responses and enhanced defense against armyworms (Spodoptera exigua). INR defines a receptor by which plants perceive herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) and expands the paradigm of surface immune recognition to attack with mandibles.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA plant cell surface receptor directly perceives peptides associated with caterpillar herbivory.",

    "abstract": "1.A potential motivation for scientists to deposit their scientific work as preprints is to enhance its citation or social impact, an effect which has been empirically observed for preprints in physics, astronomy and mathematics deposited to arXiv. In this study we assessed the citation and altmetric advantage of bioRxiv, a preprint server for the biological sciences. We retrieved metadata of all bioRxiv preprints deposited between November 2013 and December 2017, and matched them to articles that were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals. Citation data from Scopus and altmetric data from Altmetric.com were used to compare citation and online sharing behaviour of bioRxiv preprints, their related journal articles, and non-deposited articles published in the same journals. We found that bioRxiv-deposited journal articles received a sizeable citation and altmetric advantage over non-deposited articles. Regression analysis reveals that this advantage is not explained by multiple explanatory variables related to the article and its authorship. bioRxiv preprints themselves are being directly cited in journal articles, regardless of whether the preprint has been subsequently published in a journal. bioRxiv preprints are also shared widely on Twitter and in blogs, but remain relatively scarce in mainstream media and Wikipedia articles, in comparison to peer-reviewed journal articles.",

    "abstract": "Elizabethkingia anophelis bacteria encounter fluxes of iron in the midgut of mosquitoes, where they live as symbionts. They also establish bacteremia with severe clinical manifestations in humans, and live in water service lines in hospitals. In this study, we investigated the global gene expression responses of E. anophelis to iron fluxes in the midgut of female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes fed sucrose or blood, and in iron-poor or iron-rich culture conditions. Of 3,686 transcripts revealed by RNAseq technology, 218 were upregulated while 112 were down-regulated under iron-poor conditions. Most of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in functional groups assigned within \\\"biological process,\\\" \\\"cell component\\\" and \\\"molecular function\\\" categories. E. anophelis possessed 4 iron/heme acquisition systems. Hemolysin gene expression was significantly repressed when cells were grown under iron-rich or high temperature (37{degrees}C) conditions. Furthermore, hemolysin gene expression was down-regulated after a blood meal, indicating that E. anophelis cells responded to excess iron and its associated physiological stress by limiting iron loading. By contrast, genes encoding respiratory chain proteins were up-regulated under iron-rich conditions, allowing these iron-containing proteins to chelate intracellular free iron. In vivo studies showed that growth of E. anophelis cells increased 3-fold in blood-fed mosquitoes over those in sucrose-fed ones. Deletion of aerobactin synthesis genes led to impaired cell growth in both iron-rich and iron-poor media. Mutants showed more susceptibility to H2O2 toxicity and less biofilm formation than did wild-type cells. Mosquitoes with E. anophelis experimentally colonized in their guts produced more eggs than did those treated with erythromycin or left unmanipulated, as controls. Results reveal that E. anophelis bacteria respond to varying iron concentration in the mosquito gut, harvest iron while fending off iron-associated stress, contribute to lysis of red blood cells, and positively influence mosquito host fecundity.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens infecting plants and animals use a diverse arsenal of effector proteins to suppress the host immune system and promote infection. Identification of effectors in pathogen genomes is foundational to understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis, for monitoring field pathogen populations, and for breeding disease resistance. We identified candidate effectors from the lettuce downy mildew pathogen, Bremia lactucae, using comparative genomics and bioinformatics to search for the WY domain. This conserved structural element is found in Phytophthora effectors and some other oomycete pathogens; it has been implicated in the immune-suppressing function of these effectors as well as their recognition by host resistance proteins. We predicted 54 WY domain containing proteins in isolate SF5 of B. lactucae that have substantial variation in both sequence and domain architecture. These candidate effectors exhibit several characteristics of pathogen effectors, including an N-terminal signal peptide, lineage specificity, and expression during infection. Unexpectedly, only a minority of B. lactucae WY effectors contain the canonical N-terminal RXLR motif, which is a conserved feature in the majority of cytoplasmic effectors reported in Phytophthora spp. Functional analysis effectors containing WY domains revealed eleven out of 21 that triggered necrosis, which is characteristic of the immune response on wild accessions and domesticated lettuce lines containing resistance genes. Only two of the eleven recognized effectors contained a canonical RXLR motif, suggesting that there has been an evolutionary divergence in sequence motifs between genera; this has major consequences for robust effector prediction in oomycete pathogens.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThere is a microscopic battle that takes place at the molecular level during infection of plants and animals by pathogens. Some of the weapons that pathogens battle with are known as \\\"effectors,\\\" which are secreted proteins that enter host cells to alter physiology and suppress the immune system. Effectors can also be a liability for plant pathogens because plants have evolved ways to recognize these effectors, triggering a defense response leading to localized cell death, which prevents the spread of the pathogen. Here we used computer models to predict effectors from the genome of Bremia lactucae, the causal agent of lettuce downy mildew. Three effectors were demonstrated to suppress the basal immune system of lettuce. Eleven effectors were recognized by one or more resistant lines of lettuce. In addition to contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis, this study of effectors is useful for breeding disease resistant lettuce, decreasing agricultural reliance on fungicides.",
