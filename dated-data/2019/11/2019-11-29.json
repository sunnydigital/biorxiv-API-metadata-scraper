    "abstract": "As an integrator of molecular pathways, mTOR has been associated with diseases including neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders as autism, schizophrenia, and Huntingtons disease. An important brain area involved in all these diseases is the striatum. However, the mechanisms behind how mTOR is involved in striatal physiology and its relative role in distinct neuronal populations in these striatal-related diseases still remain to be clarified.\n\nTaking advantage of the D1-mTOR KO mice (males), we combined behavioural, biochemical, electrophysiological and morphological analysis aiming to untangle the role of mTOR in direct pathway striatal projection neurons (dMSNs) and how this would impact on striatal physiology.\n\nOur results indicate deep behavioural changes in absence of mTOR in dMSNs such as decreased spontaneous locomotion, impaired social interaction and repetitive behaviour. These were accompanied by a Kv1.1-induced increase in the fast phase of afterhyperpolarization and decreased distal spines density that were mechanistically independent of protein synthesis but dependent of RhoA activity.\n\nThese results identify mTOR RhoA signaling as an important regulator of striatal functions through an intricate mechanism involving RhoA and culminating in Kv1.1 overfunction, which could be targeted to treat striatal-related mTORopathies.",

    "abstract": "Fine control of protein stoichiometry at synapses underlies brain function and plasticity. How proteostasis is controlled independently for each type of synaptic protein in a synapse-specific and activity-dependent manner remains unclear. Here we show that SUSD4, a complement-related transmembrane protein, binds the AMPA receptor subunit GLUA2 and controls its activity-dependent degradation. Several proteins with known roles in the regulation of AMPA receptor turnover, in particular ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 subfamily, are identified as SUSD4 binding partners. SUSD4 is expressed by many neuronal populations starting at the time of synapse formation. Loss-of-function of Susd4 in the mouse prevents long-term depression at cerebellar synapses, and leads to impairment in motor coordination adaptation and learning. Our findings reveal that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity relies on a transmembrane CCP domain-containing protein that regulates the degradation of specific substrates. This mechanism potentially accounts for the role of SUSD4 mutations in neurodevelopmental diseases.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the earliest nonspecific symptoms of radiation exposure in humans, but its etiology, mechanism, and dose dependency remain unexplained. Investigating initial behavioral changes caused by irradiation of animals might provide important information to aid understanding of early health effects of radiation exposure and clinical features of radiation injury. Although previous studies in rodents suggested that radiation exposure leads to reduced activity, detailed properties of the effects were unrevealed due to a lack of proper statistical analysis, which is needed to better elucidate details of changes in locomotor activity. Ten-week-old male Wistar rats were subjected to single point external whole-body irradiation with 60Co gamma rays at 0, 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 Gy (4 rats per group). Infrared sensors were used to continuously record locomotor activity of each rat. Cumulative number of movements during the night was defined as \"activity\" for each day. A non-linear mixed effects model accounting for individual differences and daily fluctuation of activity was applied to analyze the rats longitudinal locomotor data. Despite a small number of animals per group, our statistical method successfully revealed characteristics of the changes in locomotor activity after radiation exposure, showing that 1) reduction in activity occurred immediately--and in a dose-dependent manner--after irradiation and 2) recovery to pre-irradiation levels required almost one week, with the same recovery rate in each dose group. In addition to improving our understanding of radiation effects on locomotor activity, this statistical framework should be useful to analyze other data with similar structure.",

The subcellular localization analysis showed that EcaICE1 was located in nucleus. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that EcaICE1 could interact with EcaSIZ1 in the nucleus of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assay confirmed that the amino acid region from position 84 to 126 in EcaICE1 was critical for the strong transactivation activity of EcaICE1 and that the C terminal region from position 361 to 557 in EcaICE1 was the key region for its interaction with EcaSIZ1 by using different truncated lengths of non-transactivation activity of EcaICE1 as the bait protein. Collectively, our results showed that EcaICE1 may have a SUMOylation pathway similar to Arabidopsis thaliana.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus methanolicus MGA3 is a thermotolerant and relatively fast-growing methylotroph able to secrete large quantities of glutamate and lysine. These natural characteristics make B. methanolicus a good candidate to become a new industrial chassis organism, especially in a methanol-based economy. This has motivated a number of omics studies of B. methanolicus at the genome, transcript, protein and metabolic levels. Intriguingly, the only substrates known to support B. methanolicus growth as sole source of carbon and energy are methanol, mannitol, and to a lesser extent glucose and arabitol. We hypothesized that comparing methylotrophic and non-methylotrophic metabolic states at the flux level would yield new insights into MGA3 metabolism. 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) is a powerful computational method to estimate carbon flows from substrate to biomass (i.e. the in vivo reaction rates of the central metabolic pathways) from experimental labeling data. In this study, we designed and performed a 13C-MFA of the facultative methylotroph B. methanolicus MGA3 growing on methanol, mannitol and arabitol to compare the associated metabolic states. The results obtained validate previous findings on the methylotrophy of B. methanolicus, allowed us to characterize the assimilation pathway of one of the studied carbon sources, and provide a better overall understanding of this strain.\n\nIMPORTANCEMethanol is cheap, easy to transport and can be produced both from renewable and fossil resources without mobilizing arable lands. As such, it is regarded as a potential carbon source to transition toward a greener industrial chemistry. Metabolic engineering of bacteria and yeast able to efficiently consume methanol is expected to provide cell factories that will transform methanol into higher-value chemicals in the so-called methanol economy. Toward that goal, the study of natural methylotrophs such as B. methanolicus is critical to understand the origin of their efficient methylotrophy. This knowledge will then be leveraged to transform such natural strains into new cell factories, or to design methylotrophic capability in other strains already used by the industry.",

    "abstract": "Success story of plant-based medicine had been overlooked during the advent of modern pharmaceutical industry. Despite the negligence of the multimillion-dollar drug industry, people entirely rely on medicinal plants in some part of the world. In this study, we have emphasized on going back to those traditional medicinal practices to figure out their underlying mechanism to move forward on phytochemical based drug development. We screened Medicinal Plant Database Bangladesh 1.0 (MPDB1.0) and on-going extension, MPDB2.0, of that database to find traditionally used medicinal plants and their active compounds. Here, Mangiferin, extracted from Mangifera indica, have been demonstrated to interact with cell cycle regulator Cyclin-dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4). CDK4 is differentially expressed during Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), Brain Lower Grade Glioma (LGG), and Sarcoma (SARC). Expression of CDK4 is interlinked to the patients survival rate and its consistent expression throughout different stages have provided the advantage to use it as diagnostic tool and drug target. Altogether, this study demonstrated that simple mango tree extracted active compounds, mangiferin, can work as potential anticancer drug and leveraging the recent advancement of sequencing and gene expression data can accelerate the phytochemical based drug discovery process.",

    "abstract": "The functions of long noncoding (lnc)RNAs such as MEG3 are defined by their interactions with other RNAs and proteins. These interactions, in turn, are shaped by their subcellular localization and temporal context. Therefore, it is important to be able to analyze the relationships of lncRNAs while preserving cellular architecture. The ability of MEG3 to suppress cell proliferation led to its recognition as a tumor suppressor. MEG3 has been proposed to activate p53 by disrupting the interaction of p53 with Mdm2. To test this mechanism in the native cellular context, we employed two-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), a single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) technique to detect and quantify the localizations of p53, Mdm2, and MEG3 in U2OS cells. We developed a new cross-nearest neighbor/Monte Carlo algorithm to quantify the association of these molecules. Proof of concept for our method was obtained by examining the association between FKBP1A and mTOR, MEG3 and p53, and Mdm2 and p53. In contrast to previous models, our data support a model in which MEG3 modulates p53 independently of the interaction with Mdm2.",

    "abstract": "It has long been considered that mechanical impedance on root will restrict root elongation and consequently promote radial growth. However, we did observe radial expansion but not elongation restriction in maize seedlings after short growth in sands. Mechanical impedance of soil can be classified into frontal- and lateral-type based on the interaction site of root. Therefore, we suspected that radial expansion might be mainly stimulated by lateral rather than frontal impedance. To verify our speculation, frontal and lateral impedance was provided separately. Small plastic caps were used to provide unique frontal impedance on root tip and cylindrical plastic containers were used to provide lateral impedance. Plastic caps could reduce root length remarkably. However, the radial expansion of plastic-cap-fitted roots was significantly inferior to that of the sand-cultured roots. Microstructural analysis revealed that sand-condition thickened root largely dependents on cortical expansion, whereas plastic cap did it mainly by thickening stele. In cylindrical plastic containers, mechanical impedance came only from the lateral direction and promoted the expansion of cortex just as sand-condition. Thus, we proposed that the expansion of the cortex and the consequent radial growth is mainly due to lateral impedance when growing in sands.",

The addition of carbachol or arecaidine propargyl ester, a non-selective or a selective subtype 2 muscarinic (M2) receptor agonist respectively, plus paclitaxel reduces cell viability involving a down-regulation in the expression of ATP \"binding cassette\" G2 drug transporter and epidermal growth factor receptor.

    "abstract": "Wildlife rehabilitation is a publicly popular though highly controversial practice. State wildlife agencies frequently debate the ecological impact of rehabilitation. Analysis of case records could inform that debate by clarifying and quantifying the causes for rehabilitation, species involved, and treatment outcomes. This information could aid in the ability of regulatory agencies and rehabilitators to make informed decisions and gain insight into causes of species decline. In New York, rehabilitators are licensed by the Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and thus, are required to submit annual reports. Between 2012-2014, 59,370 individual wildlife cases were seen by licensed rehabilitators comprising 31,229 (52.6%) birds, 25,490 (42.9%) mammals, 2,423 (4.1%) reptiles, and 73 (0.1%) amphibians. We identified patterns among taxonomic representation, reasons for presentation, and disposition. Major causes of presentation were trauma (n = 22,672, 38.2%) and orphaning (n = 21,876, 36.8%), with habitat loss (n =3,746, 6.3%), infectious disease (n = 1,992, 3.4%), and poisoning or toxin exposure (n = 864, 1.5%) playing lesser roles. The overall release rate for animals receiving care was 50.2%; 45.4% were either euthanized or died during the rehabilitation process. A relatively small number (0.3%) were permanently non-releasable and placed in captivity, and 4.1% had unknown outcomes. In comparison to data from 1989, wildlife submissions have increased (annual mean 12,583 vs 19,790), as has the release rate, from 44.4% to 50.2%. Utilizing a large data set allowed us to fill knowledge gaps, which can help inform management by both the rehabilitators and the state agencies that regulate them, deepening understanding of the scope and impacts of wildlife rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "The psychomotor activating effects of drugs such as cocaine or amphetamine can change in very different ways - showing sensitization or tolerance - depending on whether they are administered more or less intermittently. This behavioral plasticity is thought to reflect, at least in part, changes in dopamine (DA) neurotransmission, and therefore, may provide insights into how repeated drug use promotes the development of substance use disorders. Indeed, the most widely used preclinical model of cocaine addiction, which involves Long Access (LgA) self-administration procedures, is reported to produce tolerance to cocaines psychomotor activating effects and effects on DA activity. This is cited as evidence in support of the view that in addiction, drug-seeking and-taking is motivated to overcome this DA deficiency and associated anhedonia. In contrast, Intermittent Access (IntA) cocaine self-administration is more effective than LgA in producing addiction-like behavior, but sensitizes DA neurotransmission. There is, however, very little information concerning the effects of IntA experience on the psychomotor activating effects of cocaine. The purpose of the studies reported here, therefore, was to determine whether IntA experience produces psychomotor sensitization with similar characteristics to that produced by the intermittent, noncontingent administration of cocaine. It did. The psychomotor sensitization produced by IntA experience with cocaine: (1) was greater after a long (30 days) vs short (1 day) period of withdrawal; (2) was greater in females than males; and (3) resulted in cross-sensitization to another psychomotor stimulant drug, amphetamine.

    "abstract": "The safety of medicines is an essential part of patient safety. Global drug safety depends on strong national systems that monitor the development and quality of medicines. Poor quality medicines do not meet official standards for strength, quality, purity, packaging and labelling. Hence, this study determines in-vitro quality attributes of glibenclamide 5mg tablet marketed in Addis Ababa according to USP-38 drug monograph specifications. All tested brands meet the requirements for physical inspection & complied specification for friability and hardness. Besides, the tested brands met USP 38 specification for assay (99.96% to 108.85%) and for content uniformity (AV values ranges from 3.35 to 10.04). In-vitro release tests were carried out in phosphate buffer of 7.5 and 8.5 pH and showed drug release of [&ge;] 75%, met USP 38 requirements. However, significant difference with respect to dissolution profile among tested brands GL4 and GL6 were confirmed with comparator product through model independent approach. Moreover, DE values were studied and confirmed that GL4 and GL6 were not therapeutically interchangeable with innovator product.",

    "abstract": "Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a clinically aggressive and rare subtype of breast cancer, with similar features to basal-like breast cancers. Due rapid growth rates and characteristic heterogeneity, MBC is often unresponsive to standard chemotherapies; and novel targeted therapeutic discovery is urgently needed. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (DACi) suppress tumor growth and metastasis through regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition axis in various cancers, including basal-like breast cancers.\n\nWe utilized a new MBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) to examine the effect of DACi therapy on MBC. Cell morphology, cell cycle-associated gene expressions, transwell migration, and metastasis were evaluated in patient-derived cells and tumors after treatment with romidepsin and panobinostat. Derivations of our PDX model, including cells, spheres, organoids, explants, and in vivo implanted tumors were treated. Finally, we tested the effects of combining DACi with approved chemotherapeutics on relative cell biomass.\n\nDACi significantly suppressed the total number of lung metastasis in vivo using our PDX model, suggesting a role for DACi in preventing circulating tumor cells from seeding distal tissue sites. These data were supported by our findings that DACi reduced cell migration, populations, and expression of mesenchymal-associated genes. While DACi treatment did affect cell cycle-regulating genes in vitro, tumor growth was not affected compared to controls. Importantly, gene expression results varied depending on the cellular or tumor system used, emphasizing the importance of using multiple derivations of cancer models in preclinical therapeutic discovery research. Furthermore, DACi sensitized and produced a synergistic effect with approved oncology therapeutics on inherently resistant MBC.\n\nThis study introduced a role for DACi in suppressing the migratory and mesenchymal phenotype of MBC cells through regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition axis and suppression of the CTC population. Preliminary evidence that DACi treatment in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors exerts a synergistic effect on MBC cells was also demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene is responsible for telomere maintenance in germline and stem cells, and is re-expressed in 90% of human cancers. Contrary to common concepts, CpG methylation in the TERT promoter (TERTp), was correlated with TERT mRNA expression. Furthermore, two hotspot mutations in TERTp, dubbed C228T and C250T, have been revealed to assist binding of transcription factor ETS/TCF and subsequent TERT expression. This study aimed to elucidate the combined contribution of epigenetic (promoter methylation and higher-order chromatin structure) and genetic (promoter mutations) mechanisms in regulating TERT gene expression in healthy skin and in melanoma cell lines (n=61). We unexpectedly observed that the methylation of TERTp was as high in a subset of healthy skin cells, mainly keratinocytes, as in cutaneous melanoma cell lines. In spite of the high promoter methylation fraction in wild-type (WT) samples, TERT mRNA was only expressed in the melanoma cell lines with high methylation or intermediate methylation in combination with TERT mutations. TERTp methylation was positively correlated with chromatin accessibility and expression in 8 melanoma cell lines. Cooperation between epigenetic and genetic mechanisms were best observed in heterozygous mutant cell lines as chromosome accessibility preferentially concerned the mutant allele. Combined, these results suggest a complex model in which TERT expression requires either a widely open chromatin state throughout the promoter in TERTp-WT samples due to high methylation or a combination of moderate methylation fraction/chromatin accessibility in the presence of the C228T/C250T mutations.\n\nAuthor summaryPvdV and RvD formulated research goals and aims and supervised the overall progress.

    "abstract": "Phenomycin is a bacterial mini-protein of 89 amino acids discovered more than 50 years ago with toxicity in the nanomolar regime towards mammalian cells. The protein inhibits the function of the eukaryotic ribosome in cell free systems and appears to target translation initiation. Several fundamental questions concerning the cellular activity of phenomycin have however remained unanswered. In this paper, we have used morphological profiling to show that direct inhibition of translation underlies the toxicity of phenomycin in cells. We have performed studies of the cellular uptake mechanism of phenomycin, showing that endosomal escape is the toxicity-limiting step, and we have solved a solution phase high-resolution structure of the protein using NMR spectroscopy. Through bioinformatic as well as functional comparisons between phenomycin and two homologs, we have identified a peptide segment, which constitutes one of two loops in the structure, that is critical for the toxicity of phenomycin.",

    "abstract": "Insulin is a key regulator of energy metabolism in peripheral tissues but also functions as a growth factor. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor (IR) leads to autophosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues, which simultaneously initiates a multitude of signals and functions. In contrast, some artificial (non-insulin) ligands for the IR result in biased agonism, selectively activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and metabolic effects without activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and mitogenic effects. However, the precise mechanism of biased agonism at the receptor level remains unclear. The biased agonist IR-A48 aptamer selectively induces mono-phosphorylation of Tyr1150 residue (m-pY1150) in the kinase domain of IR. Hence, we hypothesized that IR autophosphorylation is a stepwise process in which formation of m-pY1150 represents an intermediate step. To explore this idea, we used hybrid receptors in which insulin can bind only one of the two binding sites of the dimeric receptor. Asymmetric insulin binding selectively induced symmetric m-pY1150 in both kinase domains. Moreover, the juxtamembrane domain, which interacts with the kinase domain, restricted the full activation of IR, and symmetric m-pY1150 played a crucial role in the rearrangement of intracellular domains to release this restriction. Our findings demonstrate that the symmetry of insulin binding to a dimeric receptor determines the stepwise autophosphorylation of IR. Furthermore, considering that the degree of ligand symmetry on a receptor depends mainly on ligand concentration, our results suggest that IR may play metabolic-biased roles in peripheral tissues dependent on local insulin concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The early insect embryo develops as a multinucleated cell distributing the genome uniformly to the cell cortex. Mechanistic insight for nuclear positioning beyond cytoskeletal requirements is missing. Contemporary hypotheses propose actomyosin driven cytoplasmic movement transporting nuclei, or repulsion of neighbor nuclei driven by microtubule motors. Here, we show that microtubule crosslinking by Feo and Klp3A is essential for nuclear distribution and internuclear distance maintenance in Drosophila. Germline knockdown causes irregular, less dense nuclear delivery to the cell cortex and smaller distribution in ex vivo embryo explants. A minimal internuclear distance is maintained in explants from control embryos but not from Feo inhibited embryos, following micromanipulation assisted repositioning. A dimerization deficient Feo abolishes nuclear separation in embryo explants while the full-length protein rescues the genetic knockdown. We conclude that Feo and Klp3A crosslinking of antiparallel microtubule overlap generates a length-regulated mechanical link between neighboring microtubule asters. Enabled by a novel experimental approach, our study illuminates an essential process of embryonic multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and PIWI proteins are essential in germ cells to repress transposons and regulate mRNAs. In Drosophila, piRNAs bound to the PIWI protein Aubergine (Aub) are transferred maternally to the embryo and regulate maternal mRNA stability through two opposite roles. They target mRNAs by incomplete base-pairing, leading to both their destabilization in the soma, and stabilization in the germ plasm. Here, we report a function of Aub in translation. Aub is required for translational activation of nanos mRNA, a key determinant of the germ plasm. Aub physically interacts with the poly(A) binding protein PABP and the translation initiation factor eIF3. Polysome gradient profiling identifies Aub role at the initiation step of translation. In the germ plasm, PABP and eIF3d assemble in foci that surround Aub-containing germ granules, and Aub acts with eIF3d to promote nanos translation. These results reveal a new mode of mRNA regulation by Aub, highlighting PIWI protein versatility in mRNA regulation.",
