    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are a large family of proteases comprising 24 members in vertebrates. They are well known for their extracellular matrix remodelling activity. MMP28 is the last member of the family to be discovered. It is a secreted MMP involved in wound healing, immune system maturation, cell survival and migration. MMP28 is also expressed during embryogenesis in human and mouse. Here we describe the detailed expression profile of MMP28 in Xenopus laevis embryos. We show that MMP28 is expressed maternally and accumulates at neurula and tailbud stages specifically in the cranial placode territories adjacent to migrating neural crest cells. As a secreted MMP, MMP28 may be required in normal neural crest-placode interactions.",

    "abstract": "The formation of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression is frequently guided by gradients of diffusible signaling molecules. The toggle switch subnetwork, composed of two cross-repressing transcription factors, is a common component of gene regulatory networks in charge of patterning, converting the continuous information provided by the gradient into discrete abutting stripes of gene expression. We present a synthetic biology framework to understand and characterize the spatiotemporal patterning properties of the toggle switch. To this end, we built a synthetic toggle switch controllable by diffusible molecules in Escherichia coli. We analyzed the patterning capabilities of the circuit by combining quantitative measurements with a mathematical reconstruction of the underlying dynamical system. The toggle switch can produce robust patterns with sharp boundaries, governed by bistability and hysteresis. We further demonstrate how the hysteresis, position, timing, and precision of the boundary can be controlled, highlighting the dynamical flexibility of the circuit.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic peptide display screening techniques can identify drug leads and biological probes with exceptional affinity and specificity. To date, however, the structural and functional diversity encoded in such peptide libraries remains unexplored. We have used the Random nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery (RaPID) system to develop cyclic peptide inhibitors of several acetyllysine-binding bromodomains from the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) family of epigenetic regulators. These peptides have very high affinities for their targets and exhibit extraordinary selectivity (up to 106-fold), making them the highest-affinity and most specific BET-binding molecules discovered to date. Crystal structures of 13 distinct peptide-bromodomain complexes, which all target the acetyllysine-binding pocket, reveal remarkable diversity in both peptide structure and binding mode, and include both -helical and {beta}-sheet type structures. The peptides can exhibit a high degree of structural pre-organization and bivalent binding of two BDs by one peptide was common, flagging the potential for a new direction in inhibitor design that could bring stronger discrimination between BET-family paralogues. Our data demonstrate for the first time the enormous potential held in these libraries to provide a wide array of modes against a single target, maximizing the opportunity to attain high potency and specificity ligands to a wide variety of proteins.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is altering the structure and functioning of communities 1. Trait-based approaches are powerful predictive tools that allow consideration of changes in structure and functioning simultaneously 2, 3. The realised biomass-weighted trait distribution of a community rests on the ecophysiology of individuals, but integrates local species interactions and spatial dynamics that feed back to ecosystem functioning. Consider a response trait that determines species performance (e.g. growth rate) as a function of an environmental variable (e.g. temperature). The change in this response traits distribution following directional environmental change integrates all factors contributing to the communitys response and directly reflects the communitys response capacity 3.\n\nHere we introduce the average regional community trait-lag (TLMC) as a novel measure of whole-metacommunity response to warming. We show that functional compensation (shifts in resident species relative abundances) confers initial response capacity to communities by reducing and delaying the initial development of a trait-lag. Metacommunity adaptive capacity in the long-term, however, was dependent on dispersal and species tracking of their climate niche by incremental traversal of the landscape. With increasing inter-patch distances, network properties of the functional connectivity network became increasingly more important, and may guide prioritisation of habitat for conservation.",

In this perspective we focus on the issue of identical or highly similar genomes assembled from independent datasets.

While ToM has been extensively investigated, self-projection with respect to ones own and others social networks has yet to be systematically studied.\n\nHere we asked participants to \"project\" themselves to four different POVs: a significant other, a non-significant other, a famous-person, and their own-self. From each POV they were asked to rate the level of affiliation (closeness) to different individuals in the respective social network while undergoing functional MRI.\n\nParticipants were always faster making judgments from their own POV compared to other POVs (self-projection effect) and for people who were personally closer to their adopted POV (self-reference effect). Brain activity at the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the self POV condition was found to be higher compared to all other conditions. Activity at the right temporoparietal junction and medial parietal cortex was found to distinguish between the personally related (self, significant- and non-significant others) and unrelated (famous-person) individuals within the social network. Regardless of the POV, the precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction distinguished between relatively closer and distant people.

We use electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral methods to investigate how sound-level statistics affect neural activity and the detection of near-threshold changes in sound amplitude. We presented noise bursts with sound levels drawn from distributions with either a low or a high modal sound level. One participant group listened to the stimulation while EEG was recorded (Experiment I). A second group performed a behavioral amplitude-modulation detection task (Experiment II). Neural activity depended on sound-level statistical context in two different ways. Consistent with an account positing that the sensitivity of neurons to sound intensity adapts to ambient sound level, responses for higher-intensity bursts were larger in low-mode than high-mode contexts, whereas responses for lower-intensity bursts did not differ between contexts. In contrast, a concurrent slow neural response indicated prediction-error processing: The response was larger for bursts at intensities that deviated from the predicted statistical context compared to those not deviating. Behavioral responses were consistent with prediction-error processing, but not with neural adaptation. Hence, neural activity adapts to sound-level statistics, but fine-tuning of perceptual sensitivity appears to involve neural prediction-error responses.",

    "abstract": "During bacterial cell division, synthesis of new septal peptidoglycan (sPG) is crucial for successful cytokinesis and cell pole morphogenesis. FtsW, a SEDS (Shape, Elongation, Division and Sporulation) family protein and an indispensable component of the cell division machinery in all walled bacterial species, was recently identified in vitro as a new monofunctional peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (PGTase). FtsW and its cognate monofunctional transpeptidase (TPase) class B penicillin binding protein (PBP3 or FtsI in E. coli) may constitute the essential, bifunctional sPG synthase specific for new sPG synthesis. Despite its importance, the septal PGTase activity of FtsW has not been documented in vivo. How its activity is spatiotemporally regulated in vivo has also remained unknown. Here we investigated the septal PGTase activity and dynamics of FtsW in E. coli cells using a combination of single-molecule imaging and genetic manipulations. We show that FtsW exhibits robust activity to incorporate an N-acetylmuramic acid analog at septa in the absence of other known PGTases, confirming FtsW as the essential septum-specific PGTase in vivo. Notably, we identified two populations of processive moving FtsW molecules at septa. A fast-moving population is driven by the treadmilling dynamics of FtsZ and independent of sPG synthesis. A slow-moving population is driven by active sPG synthesis and independent of FtsZs treadmilling dynamics. We further identified that FtsN, a potential sPG synthesis activator, plays an important role in promoting the slow-moving, sPG synthesis-dependent population. Our results support a two-track model, in which inactive sPG synthase molecules follow the fast treadmilling \"Z-track\" to be distributed along the septum; FtsN promotes their release from the \"Z-track\" to become active in sPG synthesis on the slow \"sPG-track\". This model explains how the spatial information is integrated into the regulation of sPG synthesis activity and suggests a new mechanistic framework for the spatiotemporal coordination of bacterial cell wall constriction.",

Prophages deserve particular attention as they are ubiquitous in bacterial genomes and can enter a lytic cycle when triggered by environmental conditions. We explored how temperature affects the interactions between prophages and other biological levels by using an opportunistic pathogen, the bacterium Serratia marcescens, that harbours several prophages and that had undergone an evolution experiment under several temperature regimes. We found that the release of one of the prophages was temperature-sensitive and malleable to evolutionary changes. We further discovered that the virulence of the bacterium in an insect model also evolved and was positively correlated with phage release rates. We determined through analysis of genetic and epigenetic data that changes in the outer cell wall structure possibly explain this phenomenon. We hypothezise that the temperature-dependent phage release rate acted as a selection pressure on S. marcescens and that it resulted in modified bacterial virulence in the insect host. Our study system illustrates how viruses can mediate the influence of abiotic environmental changes to other biological levels and thus be involved in ecosystem feedback loops.",

    "abstract": "Prosocial interactions are essential for group-living animals and are regulated by tactile cues shared among the group members. Neurobiological mechanisms through which social touch influences prosociality and related affective behaviors are relatively unknown. Using the evolutionarily ancient mother-young dyad as a model, we hypothesized that neurobehavioral consequences of social touch involves an interaction between central oxytocin (released during social touch) and serotonin (regulating affect and neuroplasticity). New mother rats showed upregulation of numerous aspects of the oxytocin system in the midbrain dorsal raphe (DR; source of forebrain serotonin) compared to non-maternal females. Preventing this upregulation by OTR knockdown in the maternal DR elicited infanticide, reduced nursing, increased aggression, and decreased active coping behavior. OTR knockdown also decreased serotonin-immunoreactive fibers, and increased neuroplasticity-restricting perineuronal nets, in the primary somatosensory cortex. Thus, oxytocin signaling in the DR regulates mechanisms involved in serotonin-induced cortical plasticity, which refines the tactile processing underlying prosocial behaviors.",

The key genetic construct to this end is a broad host range plasmid encoding co-transcription of rec2 and P. putidas mutLE36KPP at high levels under the control of the PL/cI857 system. Cycles of short thermal shifts of P. putida cells followed by transformation with a suite of mutagenic oligos delivered different types of high-fidelity genomic changes at frequencies up to 10% per single change--that can be handled without selection. The same approach was instrumental to super-diversify short chromosomal portions for creating libraries of functional genomic segments--as shown in this case with ribosomal binding sites. These results enable the multiplexing of genome engineering of P. putida, as required for metabolic engineering of this important biotechnological chassis.",

Consistently, disruption of wild-type EGFR leads to suppression of HER2/HER3, while mutant EGFR ablation or resistance to TKIs increases HER2/HER3 expression, compensating for EGFR loss. Furthermore, HER2/HER3 nuclear translocation mediates overexpression of cyclin D1, leading to tumor cell survival and drug resistance. Cyclin D1/CDK4/6 inhibition resensitizes erlotinib-resistant (ER) cells to erlotinib.

    "abstract": "Evidence is accumulating that evolutionary changes are not only common during biological invasions but may also contribute directly to invasion success. The genomic basis of such changes is still largely unexplored. Yet, understanding the genomic response to invasion may help to predict the conditions under which invasiveness can be enhanced or suppressed. Here we characterized the genome response of the spotted wing drosophila Drosophila suzukii during the worldwide invasion of this pest insect species, by conducting a genome-wide association study to identify genes involved in adaptive processes during invasion. Genomic data from 22 population samples were analyzed to detect genetic variants associated with the status (invasive versus native) of the sampled populations based on a newly developed statistic, we called C2, that contrasts allele frequencies corrected for population structure. This new statistical framework has been implemented in an upgraded version of the program BO_SCPLOWAYC_SCPLOWPO_SCPLOWASSC_SCPLOW. We identified a relatively small set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that show a highly significant association with the invasive status of populations. In particular, two genes RhoGEF64C and cpo, the latter contributing to natural variation in several life-history traits (including diapause) in Drosophila melanogaster, contained SNPs significantly associated with the invasive status in the two separate main invasion routes of D. suzukii. Our methodological approaches can be applied to any other invasive species, and more generally to any evolutionary model for species characterized by non-equilibrium demographic conditions for which binary covariables of interest can be defined at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Experiments comparing native to introduced populations or distinct introduced populations to each other show that phenotypic evolution is common and often involves a suit of interacting phenotypic traits. We define such sets of traits that evolve in concert and contribute to the success of invasive populations as an  invasion syndrome. The invasive Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis displays such an invasion syndrome with, for instance, females from invasive populations being larger and heavier than individuals from native populations, allocating more resources to reproduction, and spreading reproduction over a longer lifespan. Invasion syndromes could emerge due to selection acting jointly and directly on a multitude of traits, or due to selection on one or a few key traits that drive correlated indirect responses in other traits. Here, we investigated the degree to which the H. axyridis invasion syndrome would emerge in response to artificial selection on either female body mass or on age at first reproduction, two traits involved in their invasion syndrome. To further explore the interaction between environmental context and evolutionary change in molding the phenotypic response, we phenotyped the individuals from the selection experiments in two environments, one with abundant food resources and one with limited resources. The two artificial selection experiments show that the number of traits showing a correlated response depends upon the trait undergoing direct selection. Artificial selection on female body mass resulted in few correlated responses and hence poorly reproduced the invasion syndrome. In contrast, artificial selection on age at first reproduction resulted in more widespread phenotypic changes, which nevertheless corresponded only partly to the invasion syndrome. The artificial selection experiments also revealed a large impact of diet on the traits, with effects dependent on the trait considered and the selection regime. Overall, our results indicate that direct selection on multiple traits was likely necessary in the evolution of the H. axyridis invasion syndrome. Furthermore, they show the strength of using artificial selection to identify the traits that are correlated in different selective contexts, which represents a crucial first step in understanding the evolution of complex phenotypic patterns, including invasion syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-cell communication that connects gene expression to environmental conditions (e.g. density) in many bacterial species, mediated by diffusible signal molecules. Current functional studies focus on a dichotomy of QS on/off (or, quorate / sub-quorate) states, overlooking the potential for intermediate, graded responses to shifts in the environment. Here, we track QS regulated protease (lasB) expression and show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can deliver a graded behavioral response to fine-scale variation in population density, on both the population and single-cell scales. On the population scale, we see a graded response to variation in environmental population density. On the single-cell scale, we see significant bimodality at higher densities, with separate OFF and ON sub-populations that respond differentially to changes in density; static OFF cells and increasing intensity of expression among ON cells. Together these results indicate that QS can tune gene expression to graded environmental change, with no critical cell mass or  quorum at which behavioral responses are activated on either the individual cell or population scale. In an infection context, our results indicate there is not a hard threshold separating sub-quorate  stealth mode and a quorate  attack mode.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa grows in extracellular DNA-enriched biofilms and infection sites. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is generally considered a structural biofilm polymer required for aggregation and biofilm maturation. In addition, eDNA can sequester divalent metal cations, acidify the growth media, and serve as a nutrient source. Here we determine the transcriptome of planktonic P. aeruginosa grown in the presence of eDNA using RNA-seq. Transcriptome analysis identified 89 induced genes and 76 repressed genes in the presence of eDNA (FDR<0.05), and transcriptional lux fusions were used to confirm eDNA regulation. A large number of eDNA-induced genes appear to be involved in utilizing DNA as a nutrient. Several eDNA-induced genes are also induced by acidic pH 5.5, and growth in the presence of eDNA or acidic pH promoted an acid tolerance response in P. aeruginosa. The cyoABCDE terminal oxidase is induced at pH 5.5 and contributed to the acid tolerance phenotype. Quantitative metal analysis confirmed that DNA binds to diverse metals, which helps explain why many genes involved in a general uptake of metals were controlled by eDNA. Growth in the presence of eDNA also promoted intracellular bacterial survival and influenced virulence and during the acute infection model of fruit flies. The diverse functions of the eDNA-regulated genes underscore the important role of this extracellular polymer in promoting antibiotic resistance, virulence, acid tolerance, and nutrient utilization; phenotypes that contribute to long-term survival.",

    "abstract": "Protists - all eukaryotes besides fungi, animals, and plants - represent a major part of the taxonomic and functional diversity of eukaryotic life on the planet and drive many ecosystem processes. However, knowledge of protist communities and their diversity lags behind that of most other groups of organisms, largely due to methodological constraints. While protist communities differ markedly between habitats and biomes, they can be studied in very similar ways. Here we provide a guide to current molecular approaches used for studying protist diversity, with a particular focus on amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing (metabarcoding). We highlight that the choice of suitable primers artificially alters community profiles observed in metabarcoding studies. While there are no true  universal primers to target all protist taxa as a whole, we identify some primer combinations with a wide taxonomic coverage and provide detailed information on their properties. Although environmental protistan ecological research will probably shift towards PCR-free metagenomics or/and transcriptomic approaches in a near future, metabarcoding will remain the method of choice for in-depth community analyses and taxon inventories in biodiversity surveys and ecological studies, due its great cost-efficiency, sensitivity, and throughput. In this paper we provide a guide for scientists from a broad range of disciplines to implement protists in their ecological analyses.",

Here we measured the proprioception by a hand visual-matching task in multiple sessions over two days. We found that people improved their proprioception when tested repetitively without performance feedback. Importantly, despite the reduction of average error, the spatial pattern of proprioception errors remained idiosyncratic. Based on individuals proprioceptive performance, a standard convolutional neural network classifier could identify people with good accuracy. We also found that subjects baseline proprioceptive performance could not predict their motor performance in a visual trajectory-matching task even though both tasks require accurate mapping of hand position to visual targets in the same workspace. Using a separate experiment, we not only replicated these findings but also ruled out the possibility that performance feedback during a few familiarization trials caused the observed improvement in proprioception. We conclude that the conventional proprioception test itself, even without feedback, can improve proprioception but leave the idiosyncrasy of proprioception unchanged.",

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system (CNS), axons and its surrounding myelin sheaths, generated by oligodendrocytes, greatly depend on each other, where oligodendrocytes provide axons with both trophic and metabolic support. Across spices, assessment of the axon-myelin ultrastructure is the key-approach to visualize de- and re-myelination of axons. However, this assessment omits to provide information on axonal homeostasis or how axon-myelin influence one another. Since mitochondria may adjust in size thus mirroring the intracellular physiological and metabolic status we applied this to myelinated axons in the CNS. We herein show that a large axonal mitochondria diameter correlates with thinner surrounding myelin sheaths across different CNS tracts and species, including human. We also show that the relation between axonal mitochondria diameter and surrounding myelin thickness is a valuable measurement to verify advanced remyelination in two commonly used experimental demyelinating models, namely the cuprizone and the lysolecithin (LPC) model. Lastly, we show that axonal mitochondria adjust in diameter in response to the thickness of the axonal surrounding myelin whereas the opposite adaption was absent. In summary, the link between axonal mitochondria diameter and surrounding myelin thickness provide insight on the axon-myelin relation both during homeostasis and pathological conditions. This link is also translational applicable and can thus contribute to a better understanding on how to study remyelination using experimental models.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important means of intercellular communication and a potent tool for regenerative therapy. In ischemic stroke, transient blockage of a brain artery leads to a lack of glucose and oxygen in the affected brain tissue, provoking neuronal death by necrosis in the core of the ischemic region. The fate of neurons in the surrounding penumbra depends on the stimuli, including EVs, received during the following hours. A detailed characterization of such stimuli is crucial not only for understanding stroke pathophysiology but also for new therapeutic interventions.\n\nIn the present study, we characterize the EVs in mouse brain under physiological conditions and 24h after induction of transient ischemia in mice. We show that, in steady-state conditions, microglia are the main source of small EVs (sEVs) whereas after ischemia, the main EV population originates from astrocytes. Moreover, sEVs presented high amounts of the prion protein (PrP) which were increased after stroke. Conspicuously, sEVs were particularly enriched in a truncated PrP fragment (PrP-C1). Because of similarities between PrP-C1 and certain viral surface proteins, we studied the cellular uptake of brain-derived sEVs from mice lacking (PrP-KO) or containing PrP (WT). We show that PrP-KO-EVs are rapidly taken up by neurons and colocalize with lysosomes. Although eventually WT-EVs are also found in lysosomes, the amount taken up by neurons is significantly higher for PrP-KO-EVs. Likewise, microglia and astrocytes were also engulfing PrP-KO-sEVs more efficiently than WT-sEVs.\n\nOur results provide information on the relative contribution of brain cell types to the sEV pool in mice and indicate that increased release of sEVs by astrocytes together with elevated levels of PrP in sEVs may play a role in intercellular communication at early stages after stroke. In addition, amounts of PrP (and probably PrP-C1) in brain sEVs seem to contribute to their cellular uptake.",

    "abstract": "Reading aloud requires mapping an orthographic form to a phonological one. The mapping process relies on sub-lexical statistical regularities (e.g., \"oo\" to |u{square}|) or on learned lexical associations between a specific visual form and a series of sounds (e.g., yacht to /j{square}t/). Computational, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence suggest that sub-lexical, phonological and lexico-semantic processes rely on partially distinct neural substrates: a dorsal (occipito-parietal) and a ventral (occipito-temporal) route, respectively.\n\nHere, we investigated the spatiotemporal features of orthography-to-phonology mapping, capitalizing on the time resolution of magnetoencephalography and the unique clinical model offered by patients with semantic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA). Behaviorally, svPPA patients manifest marked lexico-semantic impairments including difficulties in reading words with exceptional orthographic to phonological correspondence (irregular words). Moreover, they present with focal neurodegeneration in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), affecting primarily the ventral, occipito-temporal, lexical route. Therefore, this clinical population allows for testing of specific hypotheses on the neural implementation of the dualroute model for reading, such as whether damage to one route can be compensated by over-reliance on the other. To this end, we reconstructed and analyzed time-resolved whole-brain activity in 12 svPPA patients and 12 healthy age-matched controls while reading irregular words (e.g., yacht) and pseudowords (e.g., pook).\n\nConsistent with previous findings that the dorsal route is involved in sub-lexical, phonological processes, in control participants we observed enhanced neural activity over dorsal occipito-parietal cortices for pseudowords, when compared to irregular words. This activation was manifested in the beta-band (12-30 Hz), ramping up slowly over 500 ms after stimulus onset and peaking at [~]800 ms, around response selection and production. Consistent with our prediction, svPPA patients did not exhibit this temporal pattern of neural activity observed in controls this contrast. Furthermore, a direct comparison of neural activity between patients and controls revealed a dorsal spatiotemporal cluster during irregular word reading. These findings suggest that the sub-lexical/phonological route is involved in processing both irregular and pseudowords in svPPA.\n\nTogether these results provide further evidence supporting a dual-route model for reading aloud mediated by the interplay between lexico-semantic and sub-lexical/phonological neuro-cognitive systems. When the ventral route is damaged, as in the case of neurodegeneration affecting the ATL, partial compensation appears to be possible by over-recruitment of the slower, serial attention-dependent, dorsal one.\n\nAbbreviated SummaryBorghesani et al. investigate brain dynamics during irregular word reading using magnetoencephalographic imaging in patients with semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia. Due to ventral anterior temporal lobe neurodegeneration, patients show greater reliance of dorsal, occipito-parietal brain regions - providing novel evidence for the interplay between ventral and dorsal routes for reading.",

Under fMRI, participants answered questions on each of these individuals. Using representational similarity analysis, we identified social network structure coding in the default-mode network (medial prefrontal, medial parietal and lateral parietal cortices). When regressing out subjective factors (ratings of personal affiliation, appearance and personality), social network structure information was uniquely found in the retrosplenial complex, a region implicated in spatial processing. In contrast, information on individuals personality traits and affiliation to the subjects was found in the medial prefrontal and parietal cortices, respectively.

This study aimed to explore the effects of testosterone propionate on skeletal muscle using rat model of sepsis. Male SD rats were randomly divided into experimental group, model control group, sham operation group and blank control group. Rats in experimental group were given testosterone propionate 2 times a week, 10 mg/kg for 3 weeks. Maximal contraction force, fatigue index and cross-sectional area of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were measured. Myosin, IGF-1, p-AKT and p-mTOR levels in EDL were detected by Western blot. Histological changes of the testis and prostate were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. We found that maximal contraction force and fatigue index of EDL in experimental group were significantly higher than in model control group. Cross sectional area of fast MHC muscle fiber of EDL in group was significantly higher than in model control group. The levels of myosin, IGF-1, p-AKT and p-mTOR of EDL in experimental group were significantly higher than in model control group. In addition, no testicle atrophy and prostate hyperplasia was detected in experimental group. In conclusion, these results suggest that testosterone propionate can significantly improve skeletal muscle strength, endurance and volume of septic rats, and the mechanism may be related to the activation of IGF-1/AKT pathway. Moreover, testosterone propionate with short duration does not cause testicular atrophy and prostate hyperplasia in septic rats. Therefore, testosterone propionate is a potential treatment for muscle malfunction in ICUAW patients.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of the severity of Fusarium wilt disease in cowpea and other crops relies mainly on visual rating scales which are prone to errors, which can compromise the reproducibility of the data. Furthermore, the rating scales require considerable practical training and routine experience for reliable assessment. Two objective metrics, stem vascular discoloration length (%VDL) and number of Fusarium necrotic vessels (NFNV), for quantitative measurement of vascular damage incited by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tracheiphilum race 4 (Fot4) of cowpea, were compared and their utility as a measure of disease severity and potential usefulness in other crop pathosystems is proposed. The metrics were tested in seven F2 populations and one F2:3 population, segregating for wilt response, and inoculated with race Fot4 at the seedling stage. %VDL and NFNV were highly correlated with plant wilting for all populations (r = 0.51 - 0.93 and 0.52 - 0.94, respectively). Furthermore, the relationships between the variables were linear in all populations (R2 = 0.81 to 0.87 and 0.71 to 0.91), indicating that they can provide accurate and reliable measurement of severity of Fusarium wilt disease. Also, %VDL and NFNV were strongly correlated (r = 0.88 - 0.97) and demonstrated a linear relationship (R2 = 0.69 - 0.94). Analysis of goodness-of-fit in two F2 populations revealed that errors in measurement of vascular discoloration length can result in higher segregation distortion when compared to enumeration of necrotic vessels. However, both metrics were highly effective in accounting for the severity of vascular damage caused by Fusarium wilt disease.",

We consider various combinations of continuous and bang-bang (discrete) controls, and we investigate how the control dynamics interact and respond to changes in the weighting and form of the pay-off characterising optimality. We demonstrate that the optimal controls respond non-linearly to treatment strength and control parameters, due to the interactions between species. We discuss challenges in appropriately characterising optimality in a multiple control setting and provide practical guidance for applying multiple optimal controls.

Nucleic acids possess the ability to prevent aggregation up to 300-fold more efficiently than traditional chaperone proteins. In this study, we explore the sequence specificity of the chaperone activity of nucleic acids. Evaluating over 500 nucleic acid sequences effects on aggregation, we demonstrate that the holdase chaperone effect of nucleic acids is highly sequence dependent. Quadruplexes are found to have especially potent effects on aggregation with many different proteins via quadruplex:protein oligomerization. These observations contextualize recent reports of quadruplexes playing important roles in aggregation-related diseases, such as Fragile X and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria pose a grave concern to global health. This problem is further aggravated by a lack of new and effective antibiotics and countermeasure platforms that can sustain the creation of novel antimicrobials in the wake of new outbreaks or evolution of resistance to antibiotics. To address this, we have developed a Facile Accelerated Specific Therapeutic (FAST) platform that can develop effective therapies against MDR bacteria within a week. Our FAST platform combines four essential modules- design, build, test, and delivery-of drug development cycle. The design module comprises a bioinformatics toolbox that predicts sequence-specific peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) that target non-traditional pathways and genes of bacteria in minutes. The build module constitutes in-situ synthesis and validation of selected PNAs in less than four days and efficacy testing within a day. As a proof of concept, these PNAs were tested against MDR clinical isolates. Here we tested Enterobacteriaceae including carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae, New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1 carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae and MDR Salmonella enterica. PNAs showed significant growth inhibition for 82% of treatments, with nearly 18% of the treatments leading to more than 97% decrease. Further, these PNAs are capable of potentiating antibiotic activity in the clinical isolates despite presence of cognate resistance genes. Finally, FAST offers a novel delivery approach to overcome limited transport of PNAs into mammalian cells to clear intracellular infections. This method relies on repurposing the bacterial Type III secretion system in conjunction with a kill switch that is effective at eliminating 99.6% of an intracellular Salmonella infection in human epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the FAST platform in treating MDR bacteria in a rapid and effective manner.",

    "abstract": "S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is one of the most important enzyme substrates. It is vital for the function of various proteins, including large group of methyltransferases (MTs). Intriguingly, some bacterial and eukaryotic MTs, while catalysing the same reaction, possess significantly different topologies, with the former being a knotted one. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of SAM conformational space and factors that affect its vastness. We investigated SAM in two forms: free in water (via NMR studies and explicit solvent simulations) and bound to proteins (based on all data available in the PDB). We identified structural descriptors - angles which show the major differences in SAM conformation between unknotted and knotted methyltransferases. Moreover, we report that this is caused mainly by a characteristic for knotted MTs tight binding site formed by the knot and the presence of adenine-binding loop. Additionally, we elucidate conformational restrictions imposed on SAM molecules by other protein groups in comparison to conformational space in water.\n\nAuthor summaryThe topology of a folded polypeptide chain has great impact on the resulting protein function and its interaction with ligands. Interestingly, topological constraints appear to affect binding of one of the most ubiquitous substrates in the cell, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), to its target proteins. Here, we demonstrate how binding sites of specific proteins restrict SAM conformational freedom in comparison to its unbound state, with a special interest in proteins with non-trivial topology, including an exciting group of knotted methyltransferases. Using a vast array of computational methods combined with NMR experiments, we identify key structural features of knotted methyltransferases that impose unorthodox SAM conformations. We compare them with the characteristics of standard, unknotted SAM binding proteins. These results are significant for understanding differences between analogous, yet topologically different enzymes, as well as for future rational drug design.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring fluorescence has been observed in multiple species ranging from bacteria to birds. In macroscopic animals such as birds and fishes, fluorescence provides a visual communication signal. However, the functional significance of this phenomenon is not known in most cases. Though photoprotection is attributed to fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light in some organisms, it lacks direct experimental evidence. Here, we have identified a new species of eutardigrade belonging to the genus Paramacrobiotus, which exhibits fluorescence under UV light. Using a natural variant of the same species that lacks fluorescence, we show that the fluorescence confers tolerance to lethal UV radiation. Remarkably, we could transfer this property to UV-sensitive Hypsibius exemplaris, another eutardigrade, and also to C. elegans, a nematode. Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) we isolated the fluorescent compound from Paramacrobiotus sp. This compound has excitation maxima ({lambda}ex) at 370 nm and emission maxima ({lambda}em) at 420-430 nm. We propose that Paramacrobiotus sp. uses a fluorescent shield that absorbs harmful UV radiation, and emits harmless blue light, thereby protecting itself from the lethal effects of UV radiation.\n\nSummary statementTardigrades are well known for their tolerance to extreme environmental conditions. In this study, we have identified a new tardigrade species that employs a fluorescent shield to protect itself from the germicidal ultra violet radiation.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that certain phenotypic traits of epigenetic origin can be passed across generations via both the male and female germlines of mammals. These observations have been difficult to explain owing to a global loss of the majority of known epigenetic marks present in parental chromosomes during primordial germ cell development and after fertilization. By integrating previously published BS-seq, DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq data collected during multiple stages of primordial germ cell and preimplantation development, we find that the methylation status of the majority of CpGs genome-wide is restored after global reprogramming, despite the fact that global CpG methylation drops to 10% in primordial germ cells and 20% in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. We estimate the proportion of such CpGs with preserved methylation status to be 78%. Further, we find that CpGs at sites bound by transcription factors during the global re-methylation phases of germ line and embryonic development remain hypomethylated across all developmental stages observed. On the other hand, CpGs at sites not bound by transcription factors during the global re-methylation phase have high methylation levels prior to global de-methylation, become de-methylated during global de-methylation, and then become re-methylated. The results suggest that transcription factors can act as carriers of epigenetic information during germ cell and pre-implantation development by ensuring that the methylation status of CpGs is maintained after reprogramming of DNA methylation. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which transcription factor binding during the re-methylation phases of primordial germ cell and pre-implantation development allow epigenetic information to be maintained trans-generationally even at sites where DNA methylation is lost during global de-methylation.",

    "abstract": "BrrF is a Fur-regulated small RNA highly upregulated in Burkholderia cenocepacia under conditions of iron depletion. Its computationally predicted targets include iron-containing enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle such as aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, as well as iron-containing enzymes responsible for the oxidative stress response, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. Phenotypic and gene expression analysis of BrrF deletion and overexpression mutants show that the regulation of these genes is BrrF-dependent. Expression of acnA, fumA, sdhA and sdhC was downregulated during iron depletion in the wild type strain, but not in a BrrF deletion mutant. TCA cycle genes not predicted as target for BrrF were not affected in the same manner by iron depletion. Likewise, expression of sodB and katB was dowregulated during iron depletion in the wild type strain, but not in a BrrF deletion mutant. BrrF overexpression reduced aconitase and superoxide dismutase activities and increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. All phenotypes and gene expression changes of the BrrF deletion mutant could be complemented by overexpressing BrrF in trans. Overall, BrrF acts as a regulator of central metabolism and oxidative stress response, possibly as an iron-sparing measure to maintain iron homeostasis under conditions of iron starvation.\n\nImportanceRegulatory small RNAs play an essential role in maintaining cell homeostasis in bacteria in response to environmental stresses such as iron starvation. Prokaryotes generally encode a large number of RNA regulators, yet their identification and characterisation is still in its infancy for most bacterial species. Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen with high innate antimicrobial resistance, which can cause the often fatal cepacia syndrome in individuals with cystic fibrosis. In this study we characterise a small RNA which is involved in the response to iron starvation, a condition that pathogenic bacteria are likely to encounter in the host.",

    "abstract": "Groundwater is a key water resource, with 45.7% of all drinking water globally being extracted from groundwater. Maintaining good groundwater quality is thus crucial to secure drinking water. Micropollutants, such as pesticides, threaten groundwater quality which can be mitigated by biodegradation. Hence, exploring microbial communities in aquifers used for drinking water production is essential for understanding micropollutants biodegradation capacity. This study aimed at understanding the interaction between groundwater geochemistry, pesticide presence, and microbial communities in aquifers used for drinking water production. Two groundwater monitoring wells located in the northeast of The Netherlands and at 500 m distance from each other were sampled in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018. In both wells, water was extracted from five discrete depths ranging from 13 to 54 m and used to analyze geochemical parameters, pesticide concentrations and microbial community dynamics using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR. Groundwater geochemistry was stable throughout the study period and pesticides were heterogeneously distributed at low concentrations (g/L range). Integration of the groundwater chemical and microbial data showed that geochemical parameters and pesticides exerted selective pressure on microbial communities. Furthermore, microbial communities in both wells showed a more similar composition in the deeper part of the aquifer as compared to shallow sections, suggesting vertical differences in hydrological connection. This study provides initial insights into microbial community composition and distribution in groundwater systems in relation to geochemical parameters. This information can contribute for the implementation of bioremediation technologies that guarantee safe drinking water production from clean aquifers.\n\nImportance sectionGroundwater is an essential source of drinking water. However, its quality is threathened by the presence of micropollutants. Certain microorganisms are capable of degrading micropollutants. However, groundwater is an unexplored environment, where the biodegradation potential of naturally-present microorganisms is unknown. We thus explore how groundwater microbial ecology in shaped by groundwater composition, namely geochemical parameters and micropollutants. This is a first step towards understanding which microbial communities and environmental conditions support natural attenuation of micropollutants. This study thus provides a first step towards developing in situ bioremediation strategies to remove micropollutants from groundwater used for drinking water production.",

The effects of weightlessness on key mental processes such as spatial abilities are in particular not fully characterized. In this study, we examine the influence of microgravity on perspective-taking abilities--a type of mental operation especially relevant in the context of collaborative teamwork between  free-floating astronauts. Twelve subjects performed a cooperative task in virtual-reality under both normal and short-term microgravity conditions during a parabolic flight. The task involved various degrees of mental transformations, and required subjects to perform actions instructed by a fellow astronaut aboard a virtual spacecraft. The experimental design allowed us to control for nuisance variables, training effects, and non-gravity related factors of parabolic flights. Overall, our results indicated that microgravity has a facilitatory effect on perspective-taking abilities. Notably, this facilitation was selective to conditions requiring subjects to rotate their perspective around their line of sight, i.e., for mental rotations in the frontal plane. Moreover, microgravity affected subjects differently depending on their visual field dependence, as determined via a classic rod-and-frame test. Specifically, improvement in performance was more pronounced in field-independent subjects. Together, these results shed light on a long standing debate about the impact of microgravity on egocentric mental imagery, and have direct operational consequences for future long-term missions.",

Adolescents with autism have core deficits in social learning, but a mechanistic understanding of these deficits and how they relate to neural development is lacking.

Using computational models, we tested whether participants in the MR study relied on preference structures during learning and how model predictions were implemented in brain activity.\n\nResultsTD adolescents relied on average population preferences and prediction error (PE) updating. Importantly, PE updating was scaled by the similarity between items. In contrast, preferences of adolescents with autism were best described by a No-learning model that relied only on participants own preferences for each item. Model predictions were encoded in neural activity. TD adolescents encoded PEs in the putamen and adolescents with autism showed greater encoding of own preferences in the angular gyrus.\n\nConclusionsWe specified how adolescents represent and update social knowledge during learning.

    "abstract": "Understanding how prion proteins refold from a cellular isoform (PrPC) to a disease-causing isoform (PrPSc) has been among the \"ultimate challenges\" in molecular biology, biophysics, pathology, and immunology. Conformational changes of prion proteins from PrPC to PrPSc involve the unfolding of a short -helix that overshadows the challenge. Considering the mechanisms of electrostatic attraction, thermal disturbance, hydrogen ion concentration, hydrophobic interaction, and the shielding effect of water molecules, this study reveals an electrostatic-interaction-based mechanism by means of which prion proteins refold in an aqueous environment. The electrostatic-interaction-induced protein unfolding mechanism causes a hydrophobic polypeptide segment to dangle out over the conglobate main body of the prion protein, thereby allowing the first triangular hydrophobic rung formation via hydrophobic interaction. A molecular model of PrPSc is proposed that allows the {beta}-solenoid with a triangular hydrophobic core.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWe present three main results that would revolutionize the understanding of pathology of prion diseases. First, the prion protein refolding (from cellular isoform to scrapie isoform) derives from the unfolding of the shortest -helix of PrPC, which provides a long polypeptide segment full of hydrophobic residues dangling out over the conglobate main body of the prion protein, thereby allowing formation of the first triangular hydrophobic rung via hydrophobic interaction. Second, polyanions-induced increasing in local concentration of hydrogen ion (i.e., the PH increase) undermines the shielding effect of water molecules, thereby allowing escape of the arginine side chains from the hydration shell, destabilizing the shortest -helix and initiating the refolding of PrPC. Third, a {beta}-solenoid structural model for PrPSc with a triangular hydrophobic core is proposed.",

Furthermore, we identified >900 primarily intrachromosomal fusions containing canonical splicing sites. Fusions included transcripts from well-known oncogenes, were enriched for proximal genes and in chromosomal regions commonly gained or lost in neuroblastoma. As a proof-of-principle that these fusions can generate altered gene products, we characterized a ZNF451-BAG2 fusion, generating a truncated BAG2-protein which inhibited retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Spliceosome inhibition impeded neuroblastoma fusion expression, induced apoptosis and inhibited xenograft tumor growth.

    "abstract": "Cortisol is a steroid hormone that binds to the glucocorticoid receptor with a diverse range of functions including metabolic, neurologic and immune responses. Prostglandins are lipid autacoids that participate in a wide range of functions including the inflammatory response and the vasoactivity of blood vessels and smooth muscle. Previously, a direct interaction between the two classes of biomolecules has not been studied, and here it is shown for the first time that there is competitive inhibition of cortisol and prostaglandins at the critical ligand binding domain of glucocorticoid receptors, which are found in nearly every cell and tissue in the human body. To assess molecular similarity that would enable competitive inhibition, it is first noted that cortisol (CORT, C21H30O5) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, C20H32O5) are of nearly the same molecular weight, and have nearly the same number of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen elements. The carbon-carbon double bonds on each of the two branches of PGE2, combined with the five-carbon cyclic centering structure, enable a conformational isomer of PGE2 to position the five oxygen-based functional groups at similar spatial positions as the corresponding five oxygen-based functional groups of CORT. Within the gene-regulating ligand binding domain (LBD) of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the average inter-molecular spacing of hydrogen bonding to the corresponding identical five functional groups is 1.778 [A] for CORT versus 1.746 [A] for PGE2. The conformational isomer of PGE2 within the LBD is at a lower energy state than CORT by 54.9%, indicating preference in stability. Both PGE2 and CORT exhibit a hydrophobic core within the LBD of GR, which is compatible with hydrophobic regions of the LBD. With the incorporation of two calcium ions into both PGE2 and CORT, the energy is further reduced by 58.9% and 113% respectively. PGE2 with calcium ion stabilization is lower by 15.5% in comparison to the equivalent arrangement of CORT. Because of the steroid ring structure of CORT, the spacing of the calcium ions is larger at 16.2[A], whereas PGE2, with just a single ring, collapses to 12.3[A]. Analysis of experimental data associated with the adrenal response to an injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is presented to indicate competitive inhibition of PGE2 is responsible for an observed lack of phosphorylation of the GR despite the presence of CORT. Competitive inhibition preventing normative cellular processing of cortisol, a stress hormone, by prostaglandins, which are associated with the inflammatory response, may be the causative source of certain signs and symptoms of disease, and thus is of significant medical importance.",

    "abstract": "Previously we showed that YAP/TAZ promote not only proliferation but also differentiation of immature Schwann cells (SCs), thereby forming and maintaining the myelin sheath around peripheral axons (Grove et al., 2017). Here we show that YAP/TAZ are required for mature SCs to restore peripheral myelination, but not to proliferate, after nerve injury. We find that YAP/TAZ dramatically disappear from SCs of adult mice concurrent with axon degeneration after nerve injury. They reappear in SCs only if axons regenerate. YAP/TAZ ablation does not impair SC proliferation or transdifferentiation into growth promoting repair SCs. SCs lacking YAP/TAZ, however, fail to upregulate myelin-associated genes and completely fail to remyelinate regenerated axons. We also show that both YAP and TAZ are redundantly required for optimal remyelination. These findings suggest that axons regulate transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ in adult SCs and that YAP/TAZ are essential for functional regeneration of peripheral nerve.",

However, it is unclear whether a family history of MDD is associated with alterations in the neural circuitry underlying reward processing and social cognition.\n\nMethodsWe subdivided 279 participants from the Human Connectome Project into three groups: 71 with a lifetime history of MDD, 103 with a family history of MDD (FH), and 105 healthy controls (HC). We then evaluated task-based fMRI data on a social cognition and a reward processing task and found a region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that responded to both tasks, independent of group. To investigate whether the vmPFC shows alterations in functional connectivity between groups, we conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses using the vmPFC as a seed region.\n\nResultsWe found that FH (relative to HC) was associated with increased sadness scores, and MDD (relative to both FH and HC) was associated with increased sadness and MDD symptoms. Additionally, the FH group had increased vmPFC functional connectivity within the nucleus accumbens, left dorsolateral PFC, and subregions of the cerebellum relative to HC during the social cognition task.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that aberrant neural mechanisms among those with a familial risk of MDD may underlie vulnerability to altered social cognition.",

    "abstract": "Animals in nature use diverse strategies to evade or deter their predators, including many vivid behavioural displays only qualitatively described from field encounters with natural predators or humans. Within venomous snake mimicry, stereotyped anti-predator displays are suggested to be a critical component of the warning signal given by toxic models and thus under strong selection for independent convergence in mimetic species. However, no studies have systematically quantified variation in snake anti-predator displays across taxonomically broad clades to test how these behaviours evolve across species within a phylogenetic comparative methods framework. Here we describe a new, high-throughput approach for collecting and scoring snake anti-predator displays in the field that demonstrates both low observer bias and infinite extension across any species. Then, we show our methods utility in quantitatively comparing the behaviour of 20 highly-divergent snake species from the Amazonian lowlands of Peru. We found that a simple experimental setup varying simulated predator cues was very successful in eliciting anti-predator displays across species and that high-speed videography captured a greater diversity of behavioural responses than described in the literature. We also found that although different display components evolve at different rates with complicated patterns of covariance, there is clear evidence of evolutionary convergence in anti-predator displays among distantly related elapid coral snakes and their colubrid mimics. We conclude that our approach provides new opportunity for analyses of snake behaviour, kinematics, and the evolution of anti-predator signals more generally, especially macroevolutionary analyses across clades with similarly intractable behavioural diversity.",

Here we present TensorSignatures, an algorithm to learn mutational signatures jointly across all variant categories and their genomic context. The analysis of 2,778 primary and 3,824 metastatic cancer genomes of the PCAWG consortium and the HMF cohort shows that practically all signatures operate dynamically in response to various genomic and epigenomic states. The analysis pins differential spectra of UV mutagenesis found in active and inactive chromatin to global genome nucleotide excision repair.

The analysis also unmasks replication- and double strand break repair-driven APOBEC mutagenesis, which manifests with differential numbers and length of mutation clusters indicating a differential processivity of the two triggers.

    "abstract": "The firefly Photinus pyralis inhabits a wide range of latitudinal and ecological niches, with populations living from temperate to tropical habitats. Its ample geographic distribution makes this species an ideal system for the study of local adaptation and demographic inference of wild populations. Therefore, in this study we modelled and inferred different demographic scenarios for North American populations of P. pyralis, collected from Texas to New Jersey. To do this, we used a combination of ABC techniques (for multi-population/colonization analyses), and likelihood inference (dadi) for single-population demographic inference, which proved useful with our RAD data.We uncovered that the most ancestral North American population lays in Texas, which further colonized the Central region of the US and more recently the North Eastern coast. Our study confidently rejects a demographic scenario where the North Eastern populations colonized more southern populations until reaching Texas. Our results suggest that P. pyralis originated in Central- or South America, followed by migration events that populated northern latitudes. Finally, modelling the demographic history of North American P. pyralis serves as a null model of nucleotide diversity patterns, which will inform future studies of adaptation, not only in P. pyralis, but also in other North American taxa.",

We find that both CASC20 and KIF26B are expressed in human bone. Both CASC20 and KIF26B expression is upregulated upon BMP2 induced osteogenic differentiation in primary human mesenchymal stem cells, followed by RUNX2 and OSTERIX upregulation and mineralised nodule formation.

Recent models of differentiation are represented as a landscape, in which individual progenitors traverse a continuum of multipotent cell states before reaching an entry point that marks lineage commitment. Basophils and mast cells have received little attention in these models and their differentiation trajectories are yet to be explored. Here, we have performed multicolor flow cytometry and high-coverage single-cell RNA sequencing analyses to chart the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into basophils and mast cells in mouse. Analysis of flow cytometry data reconstructed a detailed map of the differentiation, including a bifurcation of progenitors into two specific trajectories. Molecular profiling and pseudotime ordering of the single cells revealed gene expression changes during differentiation, with temporally separated regulation of mast cell protease genes. We validate that basophil and mast cell signature genes increased along the trajectories into their respective lineage, and we demonstrate how genes critical for each respective lineage are upregulated during the formation of the mature cells. Cell fate assays showed that multicolor flow cytometry and transcriptional profiling successfully predict the bipotent phenotype of a previously uncharacterized population of basophil-mast cell progenitor-like cells in mouse peritoneum. Taken together, we provide a detailed roadmap of basophil and mast cell development through a combination of molecular and functional profiling.",

    "abstract": "Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a secreted protein that signals to cells through binding to neuropilin and plexin receptors and provides neurons with guidance cues key for axon pathfinding, and also controls cell migration in several other biological systems. Sema3A interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), an interaction that could localize the protein within tissues and involves the C-terminal domain of the protein. This domain comprises several furin cleavage sites that are processed during secretion and in previous works have hampered recombinant production of full-length wild type Sema3A, and the biochemical analysis of Sema3A interaction with GAGs. In this work, we have developed a strategy to purify the full-length protein in high yield and identified two sequences in the C-terminal domain, KRDRKQRRQR and KKGRNRR, which confer to the protein sub nM affinity for chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate polysaccharides. Using chemically defined oligosaccharides and solid phase binding assays, we report that Sema3A recognizes a (GlcA-GalNAc4S6S)2 motif but not a (GlcA2S-GalNAc6S)2 motif and is thus highly specific for type E chondroitin sulfate. Functionally, we found that Sema3A rigidified CS-E films that mimic the GAG presentation within extracellular matrices (ECMs), suggesting that Sema3A may have a previously unidentified function to cross-link and thus stabilize GAG-rich ECMs. Finally, we demonstrated that the full-length Sema3A is more potent at inhibiting neurite outgrowth than the truncated or mutant forms that were previously purified and that the GAG binding sites are required to achieve full activity. The results suggest that Sema3A can rigidify and cross-link GAG matrices, implicating Sema3A could function as an extracellular matrix organizer in addition to binding to and signaling through its cognate cell surface receptors.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of field studies have shown that the phenotype of an individual plant depends not only on its genotype but also on those of neighboring plants; however, this fact is not taken into consideration in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Based on the Ising model of ferromagnetism, we incorporated neighbor genotypic identity into a regression model, named \"Neighbor GWAS\". Our simulations showed that the effective range of neighbor effects could be estimated using an observed phenotype from when the proportion of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by neighbor effects peaked. The spatial scale of the first nearest neighbors gave the maximum power to detect the causal variants responsible for neighbor effects, unless their effective range was too broad. However, if the effective range of the neighbor effects was broad and minor allele frequencies were low, there was collinearity between the self and neighbor effects. To suppress the false positive detection of neighbor effects, the fixed effect and variance components involved in the neighbor effects should be tested in comparison with a standard GWAS model. We applied neighbor GWAS to field herbivory data from 199 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana and found that neighbor effects explained 8% more of the PVE of the observed damage than standard GWAS. The neighbor GWAS method provides a novel tool that could facilitate the analysis of complex traits in spatially structured environments and is available as an R package at CRAN (https://cran.rproject.org/package=rNeighborGWAS).",

At least eight GFAP isoforms have been described, however, the predominant alpha isoform accounts for approximately 90% of GFAP protein in the central nervous system. Here we describe exonic variants identified in three unrelated families with Type II Alexander disease that alter the splicing of GFAP pre-mRNA and result in upregulation of a previously uncharacterized GFAP lambda isoform (NM 001363846.1). Affected members of Family 1 and Family 2 shared the same missense variant, NM 001363846.1:c.1289G>A;p.(Arg430His) while in Family 3 we identified a synonymous variant in the adjacent nucleotide, NM 001363846.1:c.1290C>A;p.(Arg430Arg). Using RNA and protein analysis of brain autopsy samples, and a mini-gene splicing reporter assay, we demonstrate both variants result in upregulation of the lambda isoform. We assessed other GFAP variants in the ClinVar database for predicted aberrant splicing and using the same assay demonstrated significant changes to splicing for two selected variants. Our approach demonstrates the importance of characterizing the effect of GFAP variants on mRNA splicing in order to inform future pathophysiologic and therapeutic study for Alexander disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with complex heritability and higher prevalence in males. Since the neonatal epigenome has the potential to reflect past interactions between genetic and environmental factors during early development, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 152 umbilical cord blood samples from the MARBLES and EARLI high-familial risk prospective cohorts to identify an epigenomic signature of ASD at birth.\n\nResultsWe identified differentially-methylated regions (DMRs) stratified by sex that discriminated ASD from control cord blood samples in discovery and replication sets. At a region level, 7 DMRs in males and 31 DMRs in females replicated across two independent groups of subjects, while 537 DMR genes in males and 1762 DMR genes in females replicated by gene association. These DMR genes were significantly enriched for brain and embryonic expression, X chromosome location, and identification in prior epigenetic studies of ASD in post-mortem brain. In males and females, autosomal ASD DMRs were significantly enriched for promoter and bivalent chromatin states across most cell types, while sex differences were observed for X-linked ASD DMRs. Lastly, these DMRs identified in cord blood were significantly enriched for binding sites of methyl-sensitive transcription factors relevant to fetal brain development.\n\nConclusionsAt birth, prior to the diagnosis of ASD, a distinct DNA methylation signature was detected in cord blood over regulatory regions and genes relevant to early fetal neurodevelopment. Differential cord methylation in ASD supports the developmental and sex-biased etiology of ASD, and provides novel insights for early diagnosis and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Chronic viral infections disrupt B cell responses leading to impaired affinity maturation and delayed control of viremia. Previous studies have identified early pre-germinal center (GC) B cell attrition but the impact of chronic infections on B cell fate decisions in the GC remains poorly understood. To address this question, we used single-cell transcriptional profiling of virus-specific GC B cells to test the hypothesis that chronic viral infection disrupted GC B cell fate decisions leading to suboptimal humoral immunity. These studies revealed a critical GC differentiation checkpoint that is disrupted by chronic infection, specifically at the point of dark zone re-entry. During chronic viral infection, virus-specific GC B cells were shunted towards terminal plasma cell (PC) or memory B cell (MBC) fates at the expense of continued participation in the GC. Early GC exit was associated with decreased B cell mutational burden and antibody quality. Persisting antigen and inflammation independently drove facets of dysregulation, with a key role for inflammation in directing premature terminal GC B cell differentiation and GC exit. Thus, these studies define GC defects during chronic viral infection and identify a critical GC checkpoint that is short-circuited, preventing optimal maturation of humoral immunity.",

    "abstract": "The type I interferon (IFN) response is an important component of the innate immune response to viral infection. Precise control of interferon responses is critical; insufficient levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) can lead to a failure to restrict viral spread while excessive ISG activation can result in interferon-related pathologies. While both positive and negative regulatory factors control the magnitude and duration of IFN signaling, it is also appreciated that a number of ISGs regulate aspects of the interferon response themselves. However, the mechanisms underlying these ISG regulatory networks remain incompletely defined. In this study, we performed a CRISPR activation screen to identify new regulators of the type I IFN response. We identified ETS variant transcription factor 7 (ETV7), a strongly induced ISG, as a protein that acts as a negative regulator of the type I IFN response; however, ETV7 did not uniformly suppress ISG transcription. Instead, ETV7 preferentially targeted a subset of known antiviral ISGs. Further, we showed the subset of ETV7-modulated ISGs was particularly important for IFN-mediated control of some viruses including influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data assign a function for ETV7 as an IFN response regulator and also identify ETV7 as a therapeutic target to increase innate responses and potentiate the efficacy of interferon-based antiviral therapies.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryETV7 is an interferon-induced, repressive transcription factor that negatively regulates antiviral interferon-stimulated genes essential for controlling influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

    "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), like many RNA viruses, infects hosts as a population of closely related viruses referred to as a quasispecies. The behavior of this quasispecies has not been described in detail over the full course of infection in a natural host species. In this study, virus samples taken from vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle up to 35 days post experimental infection with FMDV A24-Cruzeiro were analyzed by deep-sequencing. Vaccination induced significant differences compared to viruses from non-vaccinated cattle. in virus substitution rates, entropy, and evidence for adaptation. Genomic variation detected during early infection was found to reflect the diversity inherited from the source virus (inoculum), whereas by 12 days post infection (dpi) dominant viruses were defined by newly acquired mutations. In most serially sampled cattle, mutations conferring recognized fitness gain occurred within numerous genetic backgrounds, often associated with selective sweeps. Persistent infections always included multiple FMDV subpopulations, suggesting independently maintained foci of infection within the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Although vaccination prevented disease, subclinical infection in this group was associated with very early bottlenecks which subsequently reduced the diversity within the virus population. This implies an added consequence of vaccination in the control of foot-and-mouth disease. Viruses sampled from both animal cohorts contained putative antigenic escape mutations. However, these mutations occurred during later stages of infection, at which time transmission between animals is less likely to occur.\n\nImportancePreparedness and control of foot-and-mouth disease virus have substantial, yet distinct implications in endemic and free regions. Viral evolution and emergence of novel strains are of critical concern in both settings. The factors that contribute to the asymptomatic carrier state, a common form of long-term FMDV infection in cattle and other species, are important but not well-understood. This experimental study of foot-and-mouth disease virus in cattle explored the evolution of the pathogen through detailed sampling and analytical methods in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated hosts. Significant differences were identified between the viruses subclinically infecting vaccinated animals and those causing clinical disease in the non-vaccinated cohort. These results can benefit vaccination programs and contribute to the understanding of persistent infection of cattle.",

    "abstract": "Memory is typically thought of as enabling reminiscence about past experiences. However, memory also informs and guides processing of future experiences. These two functions of memory are often at odds: remembering specific experiences from the past requires storing idiosyncratic properties that define particular moments in space and time, but by definition such properties will not be shared with similar situations in the future and thus may not be applicable to future situations. We discovered that, when faced with this conflict, the brain prioritizes prediction over encoding. Behavioral tests of recognition and source recall showed that items allowing for prediction of what will appear next based on learned regularities were less likely to be encoded into memory. Brain imaging revealed that the hippocampus was responsible for this interference between statistical learning and episodic memory. The more that the hippocampus predicted the category of an upcoming item, the worse the current item was encoded. This competition may serve an adaptive purpose, focusing encoding on experiences for which we do not yet have a predictive model.",

    "abstract": "Controlling cells endowed with the genetic toggle switch has been suggested as a benchmark problem in synthetic biology. It has been shown that a carefully selected periodic forcing can balance a population of such cells in an undifferentiated state. The effectiveness of these control strategies, however, can be mined by the presence of stochastic perturbations and uncertainties typically observed in biological systems and is therefore not robust. Here, we propose the use of feedback control strategies to enhance robustness and performance of the balancing action by selecting in real-time both the amplitude and the duty-cycle of the inducer molecular signals affecting the toggle switch behavior. We show, via in-silico experiments and realistic agent-based simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed strategies even in presence of uncertainties and stochastic effects. In so doing, we confirm previous observations made in the literature about coherence of the population when pulsatile forcing inputs are used but, contrary to what proposed in the past, we leverage feedback control techniques to endow the balancing strategy with unprecedented robustness and stability properties. We compare via in-silico experiments different control solutions and show their advantages and limitations from an in-vivo implementation viewpoint.",

    "abstract": "Hill stream loaches (family Balitoridae and Gastromyzontidae) are thumb-sized fish that effortlessly exploit environments where flow rates are so high that potential competitors would be washed away. To cope with these extreme flow rates hill stream loaches have evolved adaptations to stick to the bottom, equivalent to the downforce generating wings and skirts of F1 racing cars, and scale architecture reminiscent of the drag-reducing riblets of Mako sharks. Hill stream loaches exhibit far more diverse flow-modifying morphological features than fast pelagic predators, suggesting as yet unknown drag reducing systems remain to be discovered. Here we describe the skeletal structure of Sewellia lineolata and Gastromyzon punctulatus and contrast that with other fish that face similar hydrodynamic challenges. We identify a major structural variation within Balitoridae pelvic sucker attachment positions which may explain fundamental constraints on the parallel development of different genera and which has not been described before. We also use high speed video capture, CT scans and Frustrated Total Internal Reflection to image and measure the sucker system in live operation and describe how it functions on a familiar activity for hill stream loaches (climbing waterfalls). We show how they can drag 3 to 4 times their own bodyweight up a vertical glass waterfall. Adaptations to high flow rates are the inspiration for this study, because there are many engineering applications where the ability to deal with high flow rates are important - either by reducing drag, or by generating the forces needed to hold an animal in place.",

    "abstract": "The visual photopigment protein rhodopsin (Rh) is a typical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that initiates the phototransduction cascade in retinal disk membrane of rod-photoreceptor cells. Rh molecule has a tendency to form dimer, and the dimer tends to form rows, which is suggested to heighten phototransduction efficiency in single-photon regime. In addition, the dimerization confers Rh an affinity for lipid raft, i.e. raftophilicity. However, the mechanism by which Rh-dimer raftophilicity contributes to the organization of the higher order structure remains unknown. In this study, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a disk membrane model containing unsaturated lipids, saturated lipids with cholesterol, and Rh-dimers. We described the Rh-dimers by two-dimensional particle populations where the palmitoyl moieties of each Rh exhibits raftophilicity. We simulated the structuring of Rh in a disk for two types of Rh-dimer, i.e., the most and second most stable Rh dimers, which exposes the raftophilic regions at the dimerization-interface (H1/H8 dimer) and two edges away from the interface (H4/H5 dimer), respectively. Our simulations revealed that only the H1/H8 dimer could form a row structure. A small number of raftophilic lipids recruited to and intercalated in a narrow space between H1/H8 dimers stabilize the side-by-side interaction between dimers in a row. Our results implicate that the nano-sized lipid raft domains act as a \"glue\" to organize the long row structures of Rh-dimers.",

    "abstract": "The androgen receptor (AR) is activated in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) despite low circulating levels of androgen, suggesting that intracellular signaling pathways and non-androgenic factors may contribute to AR activation. Many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and their ligands are also activated in these cells indicating a role for these in CRPC. Although a cross talk has been suggested between the two pathways, yet, the identity of GPCRs which may play a role in androgen signaling, is not established yet. We demonstrate that adhesion GPCR 205, also known as GPR56, can be activated by androgens to stimulate the Rho signaling pathway, a pathway that plays an important role in prostate tumor cell metastasis. Testosterone stimulation of GPR56 also activates the cAMP/ Protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, that is necessary for AR signaling. Knocking down the expression of GPR56 using siRNA, disrupts nuclear translocation of AR and transcription of prototypic AR target genes such as PSA. GPR56 expression is higher in all prostate tumor samples tested and cells expressing GPR56 exhibit increased proliferation. These findings provide new insights about androgen signaling and identify GPR56 as a possible therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer patients.",
