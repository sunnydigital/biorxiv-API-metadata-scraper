    "abstract": "We view observational causal induction as a statistical independence test under rarity assumption. This paper complements the two-stage theory of causal induction proposed by Hattori and Oaksford (2007) with a computational analysis. We show that their dual-factor heuristic (DFH) model has a rational account as the square root of the index of (non-)independence under extreme rarity assumption, contrary to the criticism that the DFH model is non-normative (e.g., Lu et al., 2008). We introduce a model that considers the proportion of assumed-to-be rare instances (pARIs), which is the probability of biconditionals (according to several theories of compound conditionals) and can be seen as a simplified version of the DFH model. While being a single conditional probability, pARIs approximates the non-independence measure, the square of DFH. In reproducing the meta-analysis in Hattori and Oaksford (2007), we confirm that pARIs and DFH have the same level of descriptive adequacy, and that the two models have the highest fit among more than 40 models. Then, we critically examine the computer simulations which were central to the rational analysis in Hattori and Oaksford (2007). We point out two problems in their simluations: samples in some of the simulations being restricted to generative ones, and in-definite values of models because of the small samples. In the light of especially the latter problem of definability, pARIs shows higher applicability.",

    "abstract": "Despite high initial efficacy, therapies that target oncogenic kinases eventually fail in advanced, metastatic cancers. This failure in initially responsive tumors is the direct result of the evolution of drug resistance under therapy-imposed selective pressures. In contrast to the massive body of experimental research on the molecular mechanisms of resistance, understanding of its evolutionary origins and dynamics remains fragmented. Using a combination of experimental studies and mathematical modeling, we sought to dissect the evolution of resistance to different clinical ALK inhibitors in an experimental model of ALK positive NSCLC. We found that resistance can originate from heterogeneous, weakly resistant, sub-populations with variable sensitivity to different ALK inhibitors. Instead of the commonly assumed stochastic single hit (epi) mutational transition, or drug-induced reprogramming, we found evidence of a hybrid scenario, of gradual, multifactorial development through acquisition of multiple cooperating genetic and epigenetic adaptive changes, amplified by selection. Additionally, we found that intermediate resistance phenotypes might present unique, temporally restricted collateral sensitivities, absent in therapy naive or fully resistant cells, suggesting new opportunities for therapeutic interference.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSkeletal muscle glucose uptake is essential for maintaining whole-body glucose homeostasis and accounts for the majority of glucose disposal in response to insulin. The group I p21-activated kinase (PAK) isoforms PAK1 and PAK2 are activated in response to insulin in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, PAK1/2 signalling is impaired in insulin-resistant mouse and human skeletal muscle and PAK1 has been suggested to be required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. However, the relative contribution of PAK1 and PAK2 to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in mature skeletal muscle is unresolved. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the requirement for PAK1 and PAK2 in whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.\n\nMethodsGlucose uptake was measured in isolated skeletal muscle incubated with a pharmacological inhibitor (IPA-3) of group I PAKs and in muscle from whole-body PAK1 knockout (KO), muscle-specific PAK2 (m)KO and double whole-body PAK1 and muscle-specific PAK2 knockout mice.\n\nResultsThe whole-body respiratory exchange ratio was largely unaffected by lack of PAK1 and/or PAK2. Whole-body glucose tolerance was mildly impaired in PAK2 mKO, but not PAK1 KO mice. IPA-3 partially reduced (-20%) insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in mouse soleus muscle. In contrast to a previous study of GLUT4 translocation in PAK1 KO mice, PAK1 KO muscles displayed normal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vivo and in isolated muscle. On the contrary, glucose uptake was slightly reduced in response to insulin in glycolytic extensor digitorum longus muscle lacking PAK2, alone (-18%) or in combination with PAK1 KO (-12%).\n\nConclusionsInsulin-stimulated glucose uptake partly relies on PAK2, but not PAK1, in mouse skeletal muscle. Thus, the present study challenges that group I PAKs, and especially PAK1, are major regulators of whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.",

With this new algorithm, we detect up to 10% of the A. thaliana genome as derived from as yet unidentified TEs, bringing the proportion of the genome known to be derived from TEs up to 50%. A significant proportion of these sequences overlapped conserved non-coding sequences identified in crucifers and rosids, and transcription factor binding sites. They are overrepresented in some gene regulation networks, such as the flowering gene network, suggesting a functional role for these sequences that have been conserved for more than 100 million years, since the spread of flowering plants in the Cretaceous.",

    "abstract": "Recent theories of cortical function construe the brain as performing hierarchical Bayesian inference. According to these theories, the precision of cortical unsigned prediction error (i.e., surprise) signals plays a key role in learning and decision-making, to be controlled by dopamine, and to contribute to the pathogenesis of psychosis. To test these hypotheses, we studied learning with variable outcome-precision in healthy individuals after dopaminergic modulation and in patients with early psychosis. Behavioural computational modelling indicated that precision-weighting of unsigned prediction errors benefits learning in health, and is impaired in psychosis. FMRI revealed coding of unsigned prediction errors relative to their precision in bilateral superior frontal gyri and dorsal anterior cingulate, which was perturbed by dopaminergic modulation, impaired in psychosis, and associated with task performance and schizotypy. We conclude that precision-weighting of cortical prediction error signals is a key mechanism through which dopamine modulates inference and contributes to the pathogenesis of psychosis.",

Mir96 is expressed in sensory cells along with Mir182 and Mir183, but the roles of these closely-linked microRNAs are as yet unknown. Here we analyse mice carrying null alleles of Mir182, and of Mir183 and Mir96 together to investigate their roles in hearing. We found that Mir183/96 heterozygous mice had normal hearing and homozygotes were completely deaf with abnormal hair cell stereocilia bundles and reduced numbers of inner hair cell synapses at four weeks old. Mir182 knockout mice developed normal hearing then exhibited progressive hearing loss. Our transcriptional analyses revealed significant changes in a range of other genes, but surprisingly there were fewer genes with altered expression in the organ of Corti of Mir183/96 null mice compared with our previous findings in Mir96Dmdo mutants, which have a point mutation in the miR-96 seed region. This suggests the more severe phenotype of Mir96Dmdo mutants compared with Mir183/96 mutants, including progressive hearing loss in Mir96Dmdo heterozygotes, is likely to be mediated by the gain of novel target genes in addition to the loss of its normal targets. We propose three mechanisms of action of mutant miRNAs; loss of targets that are normally completely repressed, loss of targets whose transcription is normally buffered by the miRNA, and gain of novel targets. Any of these mechanisms could lead to a partial loss of a robust cellular identity and consequent dysfunction.",

We definitively show that the accumulation of NK cells in the bone marrow of Tbet-deficient (Tbx21-/-) animals occurs because of a cell-intrinsic migration defect. We identify a profile of gene expression, co-ordinated by Tbet, which affects the localisation of NK cells in the bone marrow. Tbet promotes Cxcr6 expression and immature NK cells accumulate in the bone marrow of CXCR6-deficient mice. This suggests that CXCR6 is among the mediators of migration, controlled by Tbet, that co-ordinate NK cell bone marrow egress.",

    "abstract": "Identification errors between closely related, co-occurring, species may lead to misdirected social interactions such as costly interbreeding or misdirected aggression. This selects for divergence in traits involved in species identification among co-occurring species, resulting from character displacement. On the other hand, predation may select for crypsis, potentially leading co-occurring species that share the same environment and predators to have a similar appearance. However, few studies have explored how these antagonistic processes influence colour at the community level. Here, we assess colour clustering and overdispersion in 189 hummingbird communities, tallying 112 species, across Ecuador and suggest possible evolutionary mechanisms at stake by controlling for species phylogenetic relatedness. In hummingbirds, most colours are iridescent structural colours, defined as colours that change with the illumination or observation angle. Because small variations in the underlying structures can have dramatic effects on the resulting colours and because iridescent structures can produce virtually any hue and brightness, we expect iridescent colours to respond finely to selective pressures. Moreover, we predict that hue angular dependence - a specific aspect of iridescent colours - may be used as an additional channel for species recognition. In our hummingbird assemblages in Ecuador, we find support for colour overdispersion in ventral and facial patches at the community level even after controlling for the phylogeny, especially on iridescence-related traits, suggesting character displacement among co-occurring species. We also find colour clustering at the community level on dorsal patches, suspected to be involved in camouflage, suggesting that the same cryptic colours are selected among co-occurring species.\n\nThis article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology",

    "abstract": "The evolution and domestication of cotton is of great interest from both economic and evolutionary standpoints. Although many genetic and genomic resources have been generated for cotton, the genetic underpinnings of the transition from wild to domesticated cotton remain poorly known. Here we generated an intraspecific QTL mapping population specifically targeting domesticated cotton phenotypes. We used 466 F2 individuals derived from an intraspecific cross between the wild Gossypium hirsutum var. yucatanense (TX2094) and the elite cultivar G. hirsutum cv. Acala Maxxa, in two environments, to identify 120 QTL associated with phenotypic changes under domestication. While the number of QTL recovered in each subpopulation was similar, only 22 QTL were considered coincident (i.e., shared) between the two locations, eight of which shared peak markers. Although approximately half of QTL were located in the A-subgenome, many key fiber QTL were detected in the D-subgenome, which was derived from a species with unspinnable fiber. We found that many QTL are environment-specific, with few shared between the two environments, indicating that QTL associated with G. hirsutum domestication are genomically clustered but environmentally labile. Possible candidate genes were recovered and are discussed in the context of the phenotype. We conclude that the evolutionary forces that shape intraspecific divergence and domestication in cotton are complex, and that phenotypic transformations likely involved multiple interacting and environmentally responsive factors.\n\nSummaryAn F2 population between wild and domesticated cotton was used to identify QTL associated with selection under domestication. Multiple traits characterizing domesticated cotton were evaluated, and candidate genes underlying QTL are described for all traits. QTL are unevenly distributed between subgenomes of the domesticated polyploid, with many fiber QTL located on the genome derived from the D parent, which does not have spinnable fiber, but a majority of QTL overall located on the A subgenome. QTL are many (120) and environmentally labile. These data, together with candidate gene analyses, suggest recruitment of many environmentally responsive factors during cotton domestication.",

    "abstract": "The lateral habenula (LHb) is hyperactive in depression, and thus potentiating inhibition of this structure makes an interesting target for future antidepressant therapies. However, the circuit mechanisms mediating inhibitory signalling within the LHb are not well-known. We addressed this issue by studying LHb neurons expressing either parvalbumin (PV), neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (Ndnf) or somatostatin (SOM), three markers of particular sub-classes of neocortical inhibitory neurons. While we report that Ndnf is not representative of any particular sub-population of LHb neuron, we find that both PV and SOM are expressed by physiologically distinct sub-classes. Furthermore, we describe multiple sources of inhibitory input to the LHb arising from both local PV-positive neurons, and from PV-positive neurons in the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus, and from SOM-positive neurons in the ventral pallidum. These findings hence provide new insight into inhibitory control within the LHb, and highlight that this structure is more neuronally diverse than previously thought.\n\nSummaryThe lateral habenula receives inhibitory input from three distinct sources: from local PV-positive neurons, from PV-positive neurons in the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus (MDT); and from SOM-positive neurons in the ventral pallidum (VP).\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=178 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/633271v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8df117org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf226aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc94f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b76a7f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Significance statementThe circuitry by which inhibitory signalling is processed within the lateral habenula is currently not well understood; yet this is an important topic as inhibition of the lateral habenula has been shown to have antidepressant efficacy.

We have previously shown that these populations are replenished from naive precursors at high levels throughout life (Gossel et al., 2017). However, the nature, relative importance and timing of the forces generating these cells remain unclear. Here, we tracked the generation of memory CD4+ T cell subsets in mice housed in facilities differing in their  dirtiness. We found evidence for sequential naive to central memory to effector memory development, and confirmed that both memory subsets are heterogeneous in their rates of turnover. We also inferred that early exposure to self and environmental antigens establishes persistent memory populations at levels determined largely, though not exclusively, by the dirtiness of the environment. After the first few weeks of life, however, these populations are continuously supplemented by new memory cells at rates that are independent of environment.",

    "abstract": "Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is prone to mutation and not all conventional DNA repair systems operate in mitochondria, deleterious mutations are exceedingly rare. How the transmission of detrimental mtDNA mutations is restricted through the maternal lineage is debated. Here, we use Drosophila to dissect the mechanisms of mtDNA selective inheritance and understand their molecular underpinnings. Our observations support a purifying selection at the organelle level based on a series of developmentally-orchestrated mitochondrial processes. We demonstrate that mitochondrial fission, together with the lack of mtDNA replication in early germarium, effectively segregates mtDNA into individual organelles. After mtDNA segregation, mtDNA transcription begins, which leads to the activation of respiration in each organelle. The expression of mtDNA-encoded genes allows the functional manifestation of different mitochondrial genotypes in heteroplasmic cells, and hence functions as a stress test for each individual genome and sets the stage for the replication competition. We also show that the Balbiani body has a minor role in mtDNA selective inheritance by supplying healthy mitochondria to the pole plasm. The two selection mechanisms may act synergistically to secure the transmission of functional mtDNA through Drosophila oogenesis.",

    "abstract": "1BackgroundConsecutive testing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is usually employed to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits. Ideally one should model all covariates in unison, but most existing analysis methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) perform only univariate regression.\n\nResultsWe extend and efficiently implement iterative hard thresholding (IHT) for multiple regression, treating all SNPs simultaneously. Our extensions accommodate generalized linear models (GLMs), prior information on genetic variants, and grouping of variants. In our simulations, IHT recovers up to 30% more true predictors than SNP-by-SNP association testing, and exhibits a 2 to 3 orders of magnitude decrease in false positive rates compared to lasso regression. We also test IHT on the UK Biobank hypertension phenotypes and the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966 cardiovascular phenotypes. We find that IHT scales to the large datasets of contemporary human genetics and recovers the plausible genetic variants identified by previous studies.\n\nConclusionsOur real data analysis and simulation studies suggest that IHT can (a) recover highly correlated predictors, (b) avoid over-fitting, (c) deliver better true positive and false positive rates than either marginal testing or lasso regression, (d) recover unbiased regression coefficients, (e) exploit prior information and group-sparsity and (f) be used with biobank sized data sets. Although these advances are studied for GWAS inference, our extensions are pertinent to other regression problems with large numbers of predictors.",

    "abstract": "Study ObjectivesSleep disturbances and insomnia are highly prevalent in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Sleep homeostasis, a fundamental mechanism of sleep regulation that generates pressure to sleep as a function of wakefulness, has not been studied in children with ASD so far, and its potential contribution to their sleep disturbances remains unknown. Here, we examined whether slow wave activity (SWA), a measure that is indicative of sleep pressure, differs in children with ASD.\n\nMethodsIn this case-control study, we compared overnight electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings that were performed during Polysomnography (PSG) evaluations of 29 children with ASD and 23 typically developing children.\n\nResultsChildren with ASD exhibited significantly weaker SWA power, shallower SWA slopes, and a decreased proportion of slow wave sleep in comparison to controls. This difference was largest during the first two hours following sleep onset and decreased gradually thereafter. Furthermore, SWA power of children with ASD was significantly, negatively correlated with the time of their sleep onset in the lab and at home, as reported by parents.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that children with ASD may have a dysregulation of sleep homeostasis that is manifested in reduced sleep pressure. The extent of this dysregulation in individual children was apparent in the amplitude of their SWA power, which was indicative of the severity of their individual sleep disturbances. We, therefore, suggest that disrupted homeostatic sleep regulation may contribute to sleep disturbances in children with ASD.\n\nStatement of significanceSleep disturbances are apparent in 40-80% of children with autism. Homeostatic sleep regulation, a mechanism that increases the pressure to sleep as a function of prior wakefulness, has not been studied in children with autism. Here, we compared Polysomnography exams of 29 children with autism and 23 matched controls. We found that children with autism exhibited reduced slow-wave-activity power and shallower slopes, particularly during the first two hours of sleep. This suggests that they develop less pressure to sleep. Furthermore, the reduction in slow-wave-activity was associated with the severity of sleep disturbances as observed in the laboratory and as reported by parents. We, therefore, suggest that disrupted homeostatic sleep regulation may contribute to sleep disturbances of children with autism.",

    "abstract": "Real life choices often require that we draw inferences about the value of options based on structured, schematic knowledge about their utility for our current goals. Other times, value information may be retrieved directly from a specific prior experience with an option. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we investigated the neural systems involved in retrieving and assessing information from different memory sources to support value-based choice. Participants completed a task in which items could be conferred positive or negative value based on schematic associations (i.e. schema value), or learned directly from experience via deterministic feedback (i.e. experienced value). We found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity correlated with the influence of both experience- and schema-based values on participants decisions. Connectivity between vmPFC and middle temporal cortex also tracked the inferred value of items based on schematic associations on the first presentation of ingredients, prior to any feedback. In contrast, the striatum responded to participants willingness to bet on ingredients as a function of the unsigned strength of their memory for those options values. These results argue that striatum and vmPFC play distinct roles in memory-based value judgment and decision-making. Specifically, the vmPFC assesses the value of options based on information inferred from schematic knowledge and retrieved from prior direct experience, while the striatum controls a decision to act on options based on memory strength.",

This scenario necessitates symbionts to have different effects in different environments. We investigated this idea in Drosophila melanogaster, a species which communities of bacterial symbionts vary greatly among environments. We isolated four bacterial strains isolated from the feces of a D. melanogaster laboratory strain and tested their effects in two conditions: the ancestral environment (i.e. the laboratory medium) and a new environment (i.e. fresh fruit with live yeast). All bacterial effects on larval and adult traits differed among environments, ranging from very beneficial to marginally deleterious. The joint analysis of larval development speed and adult size further shows bacteria affected developmental plasticity more than resource acquisition. This effect was largely driven by the contrasted effects of the bacteria in each environment. Our study illustrates that understanding D. melanogaster symbiotic interactions in the wild will necessitate working in ecologically realistic conditions. Besides, context-dependent effects of symbionts, and their influence on host developmental plasticity, shed light on how environmentally acquired symbionts may contribute to host evolution.",

    "abstract": "To move the body, the brain must precisely coordinate patterns of activity among diverse populations of motor neurons. In many species, including vertebrates, the motor neurons innervating a given muscle fire in a specific order that is determined by a gradient of cellular size and electrical excitability. This hierarchy allows premotor circuits to recruit motor neurons of increasing force capacity in a task-dependent manner. However, it remains unclear whether such a size principle also applies to species with more compact motor systems, such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which has just 53 motor neurons per leg. Using in vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we found that genetically-identified motor neurons controlling flexion of the fly tibia exhibit a gradient of anatomical, physiological, and functional properties consistent with the size principle. Large, fast motor neurons control high force, ballistic movements while small, slow motor neurons control low force, postural movements. Intermediate neurons fall between these two extremes. In behaving flies, motor neurons are recruited in order from slow to fast. This hierarchical organization suggests that slow and fast motor neurons control distinct motor regimes. Indeed, we find that optogenetic manipulation of each motor neuron type has distinct effects on the behavior of walking flies.",

Here, we develop a new technology to harness indigenous soil microbial communities for bioremediation by flooding local populations with catabolic genes for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation. Overexpressing three enzymes (almA, xylE, p450cam) in E.coli led to degradation rates of 60-99% of target hydrocarbon substrates. Mating experiments, fluorescence microscopy and TEM revealed indigenous bacteria could obtain these vectors from E.coli through several mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), including conjugation and cytoplasmic exchange through nanotubes. Inoculating petroleum-polluted sediments with E.coli carrying the vector pSF-OXB15-p450camfusion showed that the E.coli die after five days but a variety of bacteria received and carried the vector for over 60 days after inoculation. Within 60 days, the total petroleum hydrocarbon content of the polluted soil was reduced by 46%. Pilot experiments show that vectors only persist in indigenous populations when \"useful,\" disappearing when this carbon source is removed. This approach to remediation could prime indigenous bacteria for degrading pollutants while providing minimal ecosystem disturbance.",

    "abstract": "vi.AimFossil pollen is an important tool for understanding biogeographic patterns in the past, but the taxonomic resolution of the fossil-pollen record may be limited to genus or even family level. Chemical analysis of pollen grains has the potential to increase the taxonomic resolution of pollen, but present-day chemical variability is poorly understood. This study aims to investigate whether a phylogenetic signal is present in the chemical variations of Quercus L. pollen and to assess the prospects of chemical techniques for identification in biogeographic research.\n\nLocationPortugal\n\nTaxonSix taxa (five species, one subspecies) of Quercus L., Q. faginea, Q. robur, Q. robur ssp. estremadurensis, Q. coccifera, Q. rotundifolia and Q. suber belonging to three sections: Cerris, Ilex, and Quercus (Denk, Grimm, Manos, Deng, & Hipp, 2017)\n\nMethodsWe collected pollen samples from 297 individual Quercus trees across a 4{degrees} ([~]450 km) latitudinal gradient and determined chemical differences using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We used canonical powered partial least-squares regression (CPPLS) and discriminant analysis to describe within- and between-species chemical variability.\n\nResultsWe find clear differences in the FTIR spectra from Quercus pollen at the section level (Cerris: [~]98%; Ilex: [~]100%; Quercus: [~]97%). Successful discrimination is based on spectral signals related to lipids and sporopollenins. However, discrimination of species within individual Quercus sections is more difficult: overall, species recall is [~]76% and species misidentifications within sections lie between 18% and 31% of the test-set.\n\nMain ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that subgenus level differentiation of Quercus pollen is possible using FTIR methods, with successful classification at the section level. This indicates that operator-independent FTIR approaches can surpass traditional morphological techniques using the light microscope. Our results have implications both for providing new insights into past colonisation pathways of Quercus, and likewise for forecasting future responses to climate change. However, before FTIR techniques can be applied more broadly across palaeoecology and biogeography, our results also highlight a number of research challenges that still need to be addressed, including developing sporopollenin-specific taxonomic discriminators and determining a more complete understanding of the effects of environmental variation on pollen-chemical signatures in Quercus.",

In this context, we combined two genome-wide high-content screenings to assess the functional impact of miRNAs and genes on APP metabolism and the signaling pathways involved. This approach highlighted the involvement of FERMT2 (or Kindlin-2), a genetic risk factor of Alzheimers disease (AD), as a potential key modulator of axon guidance; a neuronal process that depends on the regulation of APP metabolism. We found that FERMT2 directly interacts with APP to modulate its metabolism and that FERMT2 under-expression impacts axonal growth, synaptic connectivity and long-term potentiation in an APP-dependent manner. Lastly, the rs7143400-T allele, which is associated with an increased AD risk and localized within the 3UTR of FERMT2, induced a down-regulation of FERMT2 expression through binding of miR-4504 among others. This miRNA is mainly expressed in neurons and significantly overexpressed in AD brains compared to controls. Altogether, our data provide strong evidence for a detrimental effect of FERMT2 under-expression in neurons and insight on how this may influence AD pathogenesis.",

We followed 1348 females from two parental strains--C57BL/6J and DBA/2J--and 146 cohorts of BXD isogenic progeny strains (n = 73) across their lifespan on a low fat chow diet (CD, 18% calories from fat) and on a high fat diet (HFD, 60% calories from fat). On average, HFD shortens lifespan by 85 days or 12%, roughly equivalent to an 8-10 year decrease in humans. However, strain variation in the response of diet on longevity is remarkably high, ranging from a longevity loss of 54% in BXD65 to a gain of 37% in BXD8. Baseline weights and early weight gain are both associated with a mean decrease in longevity of [~]4 days/g. By 500 days-of-age, cases fed HFD gained four times as much weight as control on average. However, strain-specific variation was substantial, thus weight gain did not correlate well with lifespan. In summary, high fat had a strong negative effect on longevity, but genetic interactions effects were even stronger. This highlights the unequivocal importance of genetic differences in making dietary recommendations.",

    "abstract": "A defined amount of transcript is produced from transcription start sites (TSSs) of each gene, suggesting that the binding frequency of RNA polymerase varies among genes. However, what structure in chromatin controls this frequency remains elusive. We established a method to fractionate chromatin according to its degree of three-dimensional compaction. Nucleosomes were evenly detected through all of the fractions, but histone H1 was more highly enriched in the more compact chromatin fractions. Similarly, HP1 and MBD2b were more abundant in more compact chromatin, while the levels of tri-methylated H3 (Lys9) and 5-methyl cytosine subtly increased. Via genome-wide analyses, nearly the entire genome was found to exist in compact chromatin without variations between repeat and non-repeat sequences; however, active TSSs were rarely found in compact chromatin. Based on a correlation between weak compaction and RNA polymerase binding at TSSs, it appears that local states of chromatin compaction determine transcription levels.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAdaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) offers the possibility of identifying and tracking B cell clonal expansions during adaptive immune responses. Members of a B cell clone are descended from a common ancestor and share the same initial V(D)J rearrangement, but their B cell receptore (BCR) sequence may differ due to the accumulation of somatic hypermutations (SHMs). Clonal relationships are learned from AIRR-seq data by analyzing the BCR sequence, with the most common methods focused on the highly diverse junction region. However, clonally related cells often share SHMs which have been accumulated during affinity maturation. Here, we investigate whether shared SHMs in the V and J segments of the BCR can be leveraged along with the junction sequence to improve the ability to identify clonally related sequences. We develop independent distance functions that capture junction similarity and shared mutations, and combine these in a spectral clustering framework to infer the BCR clonal relationships. Using both simulated and experimental data, we show that this model improves both the sensitivity and specificity for identifying B cell clones.\n\nAvailabilitySource code for this method is freely available in the SCOPer (Spectral Clustering for clOne Partitioning) R package (version 0.2 or later) in the Immcantation framework: www.immcantation.org under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.\n\nContactsteven.kleinstein@yale.edu",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent theories of psychosis highlight the role of abnormal learning signals, i.e., prediction errors (PEs) and uncertainty, in the formation of delusional beliefs. We employed computational analyses of behaviour and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine whether such abnormalities are evident in at-risk mental state (ARMS) individuals.\n\nMethodsNon-medicated ARMS individuals (n=13) and control participants (n=13) performed a probabilistic learning paradigm during fMRI data acquisition. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer subject-specific computations from behaviour - with a focus on PEs and uncertainty (or its inverse, precision) at different levels, including environmental  volatility - and used these computational quantities for analyses of fMRI data.\n\nResultsComputational modelling of ARMS individuals behaviour indicated volatility estimates converged to significantly higher levels than in controls. Model-based fMRI demonstrated increased activity in prefrontal and insular regions of ARMS individuals in response to precision-weighted low-level outcome PEs, while activations of prefrontal, orbitofrontal and anterior insula cortex by higher-level PEs (that serve to update volatility estimates) were reduced. Additionally, prefrontal cortical activity in response to outcome PEs in ARMS was negatively associated with clinical measures of global functioning.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest a multi-faceted learning abnormality in ARMS individuals under conditions of environmental uncertainty, comprising higher levels of volatility estimates combined with reduced cortical activation, and abnormally high activations in prefrontal and insular areas by precision-weighted outcome PEs. This atypical representation of high- and low-level learning signals might reflect a predisposition to delusion formation.",

    "abstract": "Comparative applications of animal movement path analyses are hampered by the lack of a comprehensive framework for linking structures and processes conceived at different spatio-temporal scales. Although many analyses begin by generating step-length (SL) and turning-angle (TA) distributions from relocation time-series data--some of which are linked to ecological, landscape, and environmental covariates--the frequency at which these data are collected may vary from sub-seconds to several hours, or longer. The kinds of questions that may be asked of these data, however, are very much scale-dependent. It thus behooves us to clarify how the scale at which SL and TA data are collected and relate to one another, as well as the kinds of ecological questions that can be asked. Difficulties arise because the information contained in SL and TA time series is not semantically aligned with the physiological, ecological, and sociological factors that influence the structure of movement paths. I address these difficulties by classifying movement types at salient temporal scales using two different kinds of vocabularies. The first is the language derived from behavioral and ecological concepts. The second is the language derived from mathematically formulated stochastic walks. The primary tools for analyzing these walks are fitting time-series and stochastic-process models to SL and TA statistics (means, variances, correlations, individual-state and local environmental covariates), while paying attention to movement patterns that emerge at various spatial scales. The purpose of this paper is to lay out a more coherent, hierarchical, scale-dependent, appropriate-complexity framework for conceptualizing path segments at different spatio-temporal scales and propose a method for extracting a simulation model, referred to as M3, from these data when at a relatively high frequencies (ideally minute-by-minute). Additionally, this framework is designed to bridge biological and mathematical movement ecology concepts; thereby stimulating the development of conceptually-rooted methods that facilitates the formulation of our M3 model for simulating theoretical and analyzing empirical data, which can then be used to test hypothesis regarding mechanisms driving animal movement and make predications of animal movement responses to management and global change.",

    "abstract": "The formation of an epithelial tube is a fundamental process for organogenesis. During Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) invagination, Folded gastrulation (Fog)- dependent Rho-associated kinase (Rok) promotes contractile apical myosin formation to drive apical constriction. Microtubules (MTs) are also crucial for this process and are required for forming and maintaining apicomedial myosin. However, the underlying mechanism that coordinates actomyosin and MT networks still remains elusive. Here, we show that MT-dependent intracellular trafficking regulates apical constriction during SG invagination. Key components involved in protein trafficking, such as Rab11 and Nuclear fallout (Nuf), are apically enriched near the SG invagination pit in a MT-dependent manner. Disruption of the MT networks or knockdown of Rab11 impairs apicomedial myosin formation and apical constriction. We show that MTs and Rab11 are required for apical enrichment of the Fog ligand and the continuous distribution of the apical determinant protein Crumbs (Crb) and the key adherens junction protein E-Cadherin (E-Cad) along junctions. Targeted knockdown of crb or E-Cad in the SG disrupts apical myosin networks and results in apical constriction defects. Our data suggest a role of MT- and Rab11-dependent intracellular trafficking in regulating actomyosin networks and cell junctions, to coordinate cell behaviors during tubular organ formation.",

Yet, the extent to which this conserved physiology reflects conserved molecular events is unclear. Here, we map common epigenetic changes experienced by mammalian genomes as they age, focusing on evolutionary comparisons of humans to dogs, an emerging model of aging. Using targeted sequencing, we characterize the methylomes of 104 Labrador retrievers spanning a 16 year age range, achieving >150X coverage within mammalian syntenic blocks. Comparison with human methylomes reveals a nonlinear relationship which translates dog to human years, aligns the timing of major physiological milestones between the two species, and extends to mice. Conserved changes center on specific developmental gene networks which are sufficient to capture the effects of anti-aging interventions in multiple mammals. These results establish methylation not only as a diagnostic age readout but as a cross-species translator of physiological aging milestones.",

In the present study, we further examined this effect using a repeated-measures, within-participants design, and investigated potential mechanisms that might explain the effect. 50 participants completed the heartbeat tracking task (HTT) with and without the use of industrial ear-protectors, in a counter-balanced order. Participants were asked to count the number of heartbeats occurring in five discrete time intervals of 25, 35, 45, 55 and 95 seconds, without feeling for a manual pulse. HTT scores were significantly higher when ear-protectors were worn, and the improvement in performance was greatest for participants with lower baseline IAcc. The ear-protectors were associated with significantly increased self-reported heartbeat audibility, task-related confidence and concentration, and decreased levels of distractibility. Heartbeat audibility was also correlated with HTT performance when the ear-protectors were worn. Because the use of industrial ear defenders resulted in increased heartbeat audibility, this manipulation should not be used to assess causal hypotheses related to changes in IAcc. However, it may serve as a simple, non-invasive manipulation to assess the effects of  externalised interoceptive signals.\n\nHighlightsO_LIEar-protectors elicit an improvement in performance on the heartbeat tracking task\nC_LIO_LIThis improvement is greatest for participants with lower baseline accuracy\nC_LIO_LIThe improvement is associated with the auditory perception of the heartbeat\nC_LIO_LIPrior use of ear-protectors did not result in later enhanced performance on the control condition without ear-protectors.\nC_LI",

However, our current knowledge is primarily based on sequence-based comparisons between selfing species and their self-incompatible relatives, which makes it hard to distinguish causal from secondary mutations. To by-pass this problem, we inferred the genetic basis of the loss of self-incompatibility by intercrossing plants from twelve geographically interspersed outcrossing and selfing populations of North-American Arabidopsis lyrata and determining the breeding system of 1,580 progeny. Self-incompatibility was not restored after crosses between different self-compatible populations. Equal frequencies of self-compatible and self-incompatible progeny emerged from crosses between parents with different breeding systems. We propose a two-locus genetic model for the loss of self-incompatibility in which specific S-locus haplotypes (S1 and S19) are associated with loss of self-incompatibility through their interaction with an unlinked modifier.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an important part of epilepsy evaluations because of its unsurpassed ability to detect interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). This ability may be improved by next-generation MEG sensors, where sensors are placed directly on the scalp instead of in a fixed-size helmet, as in todays conventional MEG systems. In order to investigate the usefulness of on-scalp MEG measurements we performed the first-ever measurements of on-scalp MEG on an epilepsy patient. The measurement was conducted as a benchmarking study, with special focus on IED detection. An on-scalp high-temperature SQUID system was utilized alongside a conventional low-temperature \"in-helmet\" SQUID system. EEG was co-registered during both recordings. Visual inspection of IEDs in the raw on-scalp MEG data was unfeasible why a novel machine learning-based IED-detection algorithm was developed to guide IED detection in the on-scalp MEG data. A total of 24 IEDs were identified visually from the conventional in-helmet MEG session (of these, 16 were also seen in the EEG data; eight were detected only by MEG). The on-scalp MEG data contained a total of 47 probable IEDs of which 16 IEDs were co-registered by the EEG, and 31 IEDs were on-scalp MEG-unique IEDs found by the IED detection algorithm. We present a successful benchmarking study where on-scalp MEG are compared to conventional in-helmet MEG in a temporal lobe epilepsy patient. Our results demonstrate that on-scalp MEG measurements are feasible on epilepsy patients, and indicate that on-scalp MEG might capture IEDs not seen by other non-invasive modalities.",

    "abstract": "The large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a critical regulator of neuronal action potential firing and follows two distinct trends in early postnatal development: an increase in total expression and a shift from the faster activating STREX isoform to the slower ZERO isoform. We analyzed the functional consequences of developmental trends in BK channel expression in hippocampal neurons isolated from neonatal rats aged one to seven days. Following overnight cultures, action potentials were recorded using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. This population of neurons undergoes a steady increase in excitability during this time and the effect of blockade of BK channel activity with 100 nM iberiotoxin, changes as the neurons mature. BK currents contribute significantly more to single action potentials in neurons of one-day old rats (with BK blockade extending action potential duration by 0.46{+/-}0.12 ms) than in those of seven-day old rats (with BK blockade extending action potential duration by 0.17{+/-}0.05 ms). BK currents also contribute consistently to maintain firing rates in neurons of one-day old rats throughout extended action potential firing; BK blockade evenly depresses action potentials frequency across action potential trains. In neurons from seven-day old rats, BK blockade initially increases firing frequency and then progressively decreases frequency as firing continues, ultimately depressing neuronal firing rates to a greater extent than in the neurons from one day old animals. These results are consistent with a transition from low expression of a fast activating BK isoform (STREX) to high expression of a slower activating isoform (ZERO).\n\nNew and NoteworthyThis work describes the early developmental trends of BK channel activity. Early developmental trends in expression of BK channels, both total expression and relative isoform expression, have been previously reported, but little work describes the effect of these changes in expression patterns on excitability. Here, we show that early changes in BK channel expression patterns lead to changes in the role of BK channels in determining the action potential waveform and neuronal excitability.",

After 24 days of training in the delay discounting task, rats were passively exposed to vapor containing either 0, 12, or 24 mg/mL of nicotine for 10 days. To monitor exposure to nicotine, serum cotinine levels were assessed on exposure days 1, 5, and 10 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following vapor exposure, rats were retrained in the delay discounting task until stable performance was achieved, and the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on choice preference were assessed.\n\nResultsRats that were exposed to 12 and 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor displayed higher serum cotinine levels, relative to those exposed to 0 mg/mL nicotine vapor. There were no differences in impulsive choice between any of the vapor groups when tested 15-21 days after exposure. However, increases in impulsive choice were observed when testing immediately following exposure to 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor, relative to immediately following exposure to 0 mg/mL nicotine vapor.\n\nConclusionsFindings suggest that while exposure to nicotine vapor may not cause long-term changes in decision making, it can cause short-term increases in impulsive choice, an effect that can have negative social and health consequences.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid zones, where distinct populations meet and interbreed, give insight into how differences between populations are maintained despite gene flow. Studying clines in genetic loci and adaptive traits across hybrid zones is a powerful method for understanding how selection drives differentiation within a single species, but can also be used to compare parallel divergence in different species responding to a common selective pressure. Here, we study parallel divergence of wing colouration in the butterflies Heliconius erato and H. melpomene, which are distantly related Mullerian mimics that show parallel geographic variation in both discrete variation in pigmentation, and quantitative variation in structural colour. Using geographic cline analysis, we show that clines in these traits are positioned in the roughly the same geographic region for both species, which is consistent with direct selection for mimicry. However, the width of the clines varies markedly between species. This difference is explained in part by variation in the strength of selection acting on colour traits within each species, but may also be influenced by differences in the dispersal rate and total strength of selection against hybrids between the species. Genotyping-by-sequencing also revealed weaker population structure in H. melpomene, suggesting the hybrid zones may have evolved differently in each species; which may also contribute to the patterns of phenotypic divergence in this system Overall, we conclude that multiple factors are needed to explain patterns of clinal variation within and between these species, although mimicry has probably played a central role.",

    "abstract": "Viruses that infect bacteria, i.e., bacteriophage or  phage, are increasingly considered as treatment options for the control and clearance of bacterial infections, particularly as compassionate use therapy for multi-drug resistant infections. In practice, clinical use of phage often involves the application of multiple therapeutic phage, either together or sequentially. However, the selection and timing of therapeutic phage delivery remains largely ad hoc. In this study, we evaluate principles underlying why careful application of multiple phage (i.e., a  cocktail) might lead to therapeutic success in contrast to the failure of single-strain phage therapy to control an infection. First, we use a nonlinear dynamics model of within-host interactions to show that a combination of fast intra-host phage decay, evolution of phage resistance amongst bacteria, and/or compromised immune response might limit the effectiveness of single-strain phage therapy. To resolve these problems, we combine dynamical modeling of phage, bacteria, and host immune cell populations with control-theoretic principles (via optimal control theory) to devise evolutionarily robust phage cocktails and delivery schedules to control the bacterial populations. Our numerical results suggest that optimal administration of single-strain phage therapy may be sufficient for curative outcomes in immunocompetent patients, but may fail in immunodeficient hosts due to phage resistance. We show that optimized treatment with a two-phage cocktail that includes a counter-resistant phage can restore therapeutic efficacy in immunodeficient hosts.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate native RNA sequencing for sequencing HIV-1 viral genomes\n\nMethodsFifteen HIV-1 strains were processed with Direct RNA Sequencing (SQK-RNA002) library kits and sequenced on MinION Mk1B devices with RevD flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). Raw reads were converted to FASTQ, aligned to reference sequences, and assembled into contigs. Multi-sequence alignments of the contigs were generated and used for cladistics analysis.\n\nResultsWe sequenced full-length HIV-1 from the transcriptional start site to 3 LTR (100% virion genome) in 3 out of 15 isolates (89.6, NLAD8, AD17), achieving majority coverage (defined as > 50%) in another 7 out of 15 isolates. Inspection of NLAD8 sequence alignments revealed splicing or deletion signatures. Despite the strong 3 bias, read coverage was sufficient to evaluate single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions in 9 isolates, and to assemble HIV-1 genomes directly from viral RNA, achieving a maximum of 94% assembly coverage for NLAD8. Phylogenetic relationships were maintained at the level of contigs, as well as individual reads.\n\nConclusionsONT native RNA sequencing performed as expected, covering full-length HIV-1 RNA without PCR or cDNA sequencing. Native single-molecule RNA sequencing supported previous models of HIV-1 replication, and samples exhibited strain-specific transcriptional signals. We propose Context Dependency Variant Classification to describe variants occurring in information-dense regions of HIV. These data provide rich resources for emerging RNA modification detection schemes. Future work will expand HIV-1 transcript profiling to infection models and clinical samples.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsProminin-1 (PROM1) is known to be upregulated in hepatocytic progenitor cells (HPCs) and cholangiocytes of fibrotic livers. To understand the function of upregulated PROM1 during liver fibrosis, we analyzed liver fibrosis from global and liver-specific Prom1 knockout mice and investigated the molecular mechanism of how Prom1 protects the liver against liver fibrosis.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed PROM1 expression from human liver with mild and severe liver fibrosis (n=4-9). Liver fibrosis was induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment and bile duct ligation (BDL) from wild type and global and liver-specific knockout mice (n=3-13). The severity of liver fibrosis was determined by qRT-PCR, immunostaining and immunoblotting for fibrotic markers such as SMA, collagen. TGF{beta} signaling was also analyzed from fibrotic liver and primary hepatocytes of wild type and global and liver-specific knockout mice (n=3-5). Molecular interaction between PROM1 and SMAD7 was determined by endogenous and exogenous co-immunoprecipitation.\n\nResultsPROM1 was found in the plasma membranes of both healthy and fibrotic hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Global Prom1 knockout aggravated BDL- and CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Prom1-/- hepatocytes showed increased TGF{beta} signaling due to reduced SMAD7 protein expression compared to that in wild-type hepatocytes. PROM1 prevented SMURF2-induced SMAD7 ubiquitination and degradation by interfering with the molecular association of SMAD7 with SMURF2. We also demonstrated that liver-specific Prom 1 knockout aggravated BDL-induced liver fibrosis due to reduced levels of SMAD7.\n\nConclusionHepatocytic PROM1 stabilizes SMAD7, preventing TGF{beta} signaling. Thus, PROM1 is necessary for the negative regulation of TGF{beta} signaling during liver fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) is the mental simulation of an action without any apparent muscular contraction. By means of transcranial magnetic stimulation, few studies revealed a decrease of short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) within the primary motor cortex. However, this decrease is ambiguous, as one would expect greater inhibition during MI to prevent overt motor output. The current study investigated the extent of SICI modulation during MI through a methodological and a conceptual reconsideration of i) the importance of parameters to assess SICI (Exp.1) and ii) the inhibitory process within the primary motor cortex as an inherent feature of MI (Exp.2). Participants performed two tasks: 1) rest and 2) imagery of isometric abduction of the right index finger. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, motor evoked potentials were elicited in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. An adaptive threshold-hunting paradigm was used, where the stimulus intensity required to maintain a fixed motor evoked potential amplitude was quantified. To test SICI, we conditioned the test stimulus with a conditioning stimulus (CS) of different intensities. Results revealed an Intensity by Task interaction showing that SICI decreased during MI as compared to rest only for the higher CS intensity (Exp.1). At the lowest CS intensities, a Task main effect revealed that SICI increased during MI (Exp.2). SICI modulation during MI depends critically on the CS intensity. By optimising CS intensity, we have shown that SICI circuits may increase during MI, revealing a potential mechanism to prevent the production of a movement while the motor system is activated.\n\nHighlightsO_LIExcitatory and inhibitory neural processes interact during motor imagery, as the motor regions are activated but no movement is produced.\nC_LIO_LIThe current study investigated the extent of short interval intracortical inhibition modulation (SICI) during motor imagery.\nC_LIO_LIWhen using optimal settings, SICI increased during motor imagery, likely to prevent the production of an overt movement.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The exact mechanisms at the root of pathologic anatomical covariances are still unknown. It is nonetheless becoming clearer that the impact of brain diseases is more convincingly represented in terms of co-alterations rather than in terms of localization of alterations. According to this view, neurological and psychiatric conditions might be seen as whole-brain patterns of modifications. In this context, the physical distance between two co-altered areas may provide insightful information about how pathology develops across the brain, assuming that long-range co-alterations might be relevant features of pathological networks. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we calculated the probability of co-alteration between brain areas across a large database of voxel-based morphometry studies of psychiatric and neurological disorders, and we investigated the physical (Euclidean) distance of the edges of the resulting network. Such analysis produced a series of observations relevant for the understanding of pathology, which range from unanticipated results to the recognition of regions of well-known functional and clinical relevance. For instance, it emphasizes the importance of the anterior and dorsal prefrontal cortices in the distribution of the disease-related alterations, as well as a specular asymmetry of gray matter decreases and increases between the hemispheres. Also, the analyses of schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease show that long-distance co-alterations are able to identify areas involved in pathology and symptomatology. Moreover, the good concordance between the measure of the mean physical distance and that of functional degree centrality suggests that co-alterations and connectivity are intimately related. These findings highlight the importance of analyzing the physical distance in pathology, as the areas characterized by a long mean distance may be considered as hubs with a crucial role in the systems of alterations induced by brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "Human action-stopping is thought to rely on a prefronto-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network, with right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) posited to play a critical role in the early stage of implementation. Here we sought causal evidence for this idea in experiments involving healthy human participants. We first show that action-stopping is preceded by bursts of electroencephalographic activity in the beta band over prefrontal electrodes, putatively rIFC, and that the timing of these bursts correlates with the latency of stopping at a single-trial level: earlier bursts are associated with faster stopping. From this we reasoned that the integrity of rIFC at the time of beta bursts might be critical to successful stopping. We then used fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt rIFC at the approximate time of beta bursting. Stimulation prolonged stopping latencies and, moreover, the prolongation was most pronounced in individuals for whom the pulse appeared closer to the presumed time of beta bursting. These results help validate a model of the neural architecture and temporal dynamics of action-stopping. They also highlight the usefulness of prefrontal beta bursts to index an apparently important sub-process of stopping, the timing of which might help explain within- and between-individual variation in impulse control.",

    "abstract": "Auxin plays a key role across all land plants in growth and developmental processes. Although auxin signaling function has diverged and expanded, differences in the molecular functions of signaling components have largely been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we used the Auxin Response Circuit recapitulated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ARCSc) system to functionally annotate maize auxin signaling components, focusing on genes expressed during development of ear and tassel inflorescences. All 16 maize Auxin (Aux)/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA) repressor proteins are degraded in response to auxin, with rates that depended on both receptor and repressor identity. When fused to the maize TOPLESS (TPL) homolog RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2), maize Aux/IAAs were able to repress AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcriptional activity. A complete auxin response circuit comprised of all maize components, including ZmAFB2/3 b1 maize AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) receptor, was found to be fully functional. The ZmAFB2/3 b1 auxin receptor was found to be more sensitive to hormone than AtAFB2 and allowed for rapid circuit activation upon auxin addition. These results validate the conserved role of predicted auxin response genes in maize, as well as provide evidence that a synthetic approach can facilitate broader comparative studies across the wide range of species with sequenced genomes.\n\nA synthetic maize auxin response circuit is recapitulated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealing a highly sensitive auxin signaling network with functional homology to the Arabidopsis circuit.",

Merton (1957) observed in Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science that \"what is true of physics, chemistry, astronomy, medicine and mathematics is true also of all the other scientific disciplines, not excluding the social and psychological sciences\". However, consensus over related issues, such as what constitutes plagiarism in these fields cannot be taken for granted. We conducted a comprehensive study on plagiarism views among PhD holders registered in the database of the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). We collected 25,157 valid responses encompassing views and attitudes toward plagiarism from a probability sample of PhD holders across the fields, including biologists, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers as well as linguists, philosophers and anthropologists. The results suggest that core principles about plagiarism are shared among this multidisciplinary community and that they corroborate Mertons observations. Before this study, we could only speculate that this is the case. With these data from a probability sample of Brazilian academia (PhD holders), this study offers insight into the way plagiarism is perceived across the sciences, including the literature and arts, and sheds light on the problem in the context of international collaborative research networks. The data focus on a young research system in Latin America, but, given the cultural similarities that bind most Latin-American nations, these results may be relevant to other PhD populations in the region and should provide a comparison with studies from other emerging, non-Anglophone regions.",

To explore potential roles of HCs in genome metabolism, proteins capable of binding specifically HCs were purified by fractionating nuclear extracts from Hela cells. This approach identified three RNA-binding proteins: the Tudor-Staphylococcal Nuclease Domain 1 (SND1) protein and two proteins from the Drosophila behavior human splicing family, the ParaSpeckle Protein Component 1 and the Splicing Factor Proline- and Glutamine- rich protein. Since these proteins were partially pure after fractionation, truncated forms of these proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. The specificity of their interaction with HCs was re-examined in vitro. The two truncated purified SND1 proteins exhibited a high specificity for HCs, suggesting a role of SND1 protein in targeting the basic transcription machinery to HC structures.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are highly dynamic filaments with dramatic structural rearrangements and length changes during the cell cycle. An accurate control of the microtubule length is essential for many cellular processes in particular, during cell division. Motor proteins from the kinesin-8 family depolymerize microtubules by interacting with their ends in a collective and length-dependent manner. However, it is still unclear how kinesin-8 depolymerizes microtubules. Here, we tracked the microtubule end-binding activity of yeast kinesin-8, Kip3, under varying loads and nucleotide conditions using high-precision optical tweezers. We found that single Kip3 motors spent up to 200 s at the microtubule end and were not stationary there but took several 8-nm forward and backward steps that were suppressed by loads. Interestingly, increased loads, similar to increased motor concentrations, also exponentially decreased the motors residence time at the microtubule end. On the microtubule lattice, loads also exponentially decreased the run length and time. However, for the same load, lattice run times were significantly longer compared to end residence times suggesting the presence of a distinct force-dependent detachment mechanism at the microtubule end. The force dependence of the end residence time enabled us to estimate what force must act on a single motor to achieve the microtubule depolymerization speed of a motor ensemble. This force is higher than the stall force of a single Kip3 motor, supporting a collective force-dependent depolymerization mechanism that unifies the so-called \"bump-off\" and \"switching\" models. Understanding the mechanics of kinesin-8s microtubule end activity will provide important insights into cell division with implications for cancer research.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEKinesin-8 motors are important for microtubule length regulation and are over-expressed in different types of cancer. Yet, on the molecular level, it is unclear how these motors depolymerize microtubules. Using high-precision optical tweezers, we measured how single yeast kinesin-8 motors, Kip3, interacted with the microtubule end. Interestingly, we found that single Kip3 motors were still motile at the microtubule end. The force dependence of how long single motors were associated with the microtubule end enabled us to estimate what force motors must exert onto each other to achieve the collective microtubule depolymerization speed of many motors. Our data support a collective force-dependent depolymerization mechanism. A better understanding of Kip3s microtubule end activity has implications for cell division and associated diseases.",

Although studies showed a number of PPR proteins generally influence the editing of organellar genes, few of them were characterized in detail in rice. Here, we report a PLS-E subclass PPR protein in rice, PPR756, loss of function of which led to the abolishment of RNA editing events among three mitochondrial genes including atp6, ccmC, and nad7. Their defective C-to-U transformation then resulted in improper amino acid retention which could cause abortive pollen development. Furthermore, PPR756 could bind to the three target genes directly and interact with three OsMORFs (multiple organellar RNA editing factors): OsMORF1, OsMORF8-1, and OsMORF8-2. The knock-out plants of PPR756 exhibited retarded growth and greener leaves during the early vegetative stages, along with sterile pollen and lower seed setting at the reproductive stage. These results established a role for PPR756 in rice development, participating in RNA editing of three various transcripts and cooperating with OsMORFs via an editosome manner in rice.",

    "abstract": "Sp1 (Specificity protein 1)-CSE (cystathionine-{gamma}-lyase)-H2S (hydrogen sulfide) pathway plays an important role in homocysteine-metabolism, whose disorder can result in hyperhomocysteinemia. The deficiency of plasma H2S in patients and animal models with hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported but it is unclear whether this deficiency plays a role in the progress of hyperhomocysteinemia. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether the post-translational modification of Sp1 or CSE mediated by hyperhomocysteinemia itself can in turn affect the development of hyperhomocysteinemia. By both in vivo and in vitro studies, we conducted immunoprecipitation and maleimide assays to detect the post-translational modification of Sp1-CSE-H2S pathway and revealed four major findings: (1) the accumulation of homocysteine augmented the nitration of CSE, thus blunted its bio-activity and caused H2S deficiency. (2) H2S deficiency lowered the S-sulfhydration of Sp1 and inhibited its transcriptional activity, resulted in lower expression of CSE. CSE deficiency decreased the H2S level further, which in turn lowered the S-sulfhydration level of CSE. (3) CSE was S-sulfhydrated at Cys84, Cys109, Cys172, Cys229, Cys252, Cys307 and Cys310 under physiological conditions, mutation of Cys84, Cys109, Cys229, Cys252 and Cys307 decreased its S-sulfhydration level and bio-activity. (4) H2S deficiency could trap hyperhomocysteinemia into a progressive vicious circle and trigger a rapid increase of homocysteine, while blocking nitration or restoring S-sulfhydration could break this circle. In conclusion, this study reveals a novel mechanism involved in the disorder of homocysteine-metabolism, which may provide a candidate therapeutic strategy for hyperhomocysteinemia.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is the most common age-related metabolic bone disorder, which is characterised by low bone mass and deterioration in bone architecture, with a propensity to fragility fractures. The best treatment for osteoporosis relies on stimulation of osteoblasts to form new bone and restore bone structure, however anabolic therapeutics are few and their use is time-restricted. Here we report that Syndecan-3 (SDC3) increases new bone formation through enhancement of WNT signalling. Young adult Sdc3-/- mice have a low bone volume phenotype associated with reduced bone formation, increased bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT), increased bone fragility and a blunted anabolic bone formation response to mechanical loading. The premature osteoporosis-like phenotype of Sdc3-/- mice is primarily explained by delayed osteoblast maturation and impaired osteoblast function, with contributing increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Mechanistically, SDC3 enhances canonical WNT signalling in osteoblasts through stabilisation of Frizzled 1, making SDC3 an attractive target for novel anabolic drug development.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the normal functions of GSK-3{beta} in the central nervous system is of major interest because deregulation of this kinase is strongly implicated in a variety of serious brain conditions, such as Alzheimer disease, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. GSK-3{beta} plays a role in the induction of NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and several substrates for GSK-3{beta} have been identified in this form of synaptic plasticity, including KLC-2, PSD-95 and tau. Stabilization of NMDA receptors at synapses has also been shown to involve GSK-3{beta}, but the substrates involved are currently unknown. Recent work has identified phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase type II (PI4KII) as a neuronal GSK-3{beta} substrate that can potentially regulate the surface expression of AMPA receptors. In the present study, we investigated the synaptic role of PI4KII in organotypic rat hippocampal slices. We found that knockdown of PI4KII had no effect on synaptic AMPA receptors but substantially inhibited synaptic NMDA receptors. Furthermore, the ability of the selective GSK-3 inhibitor, CT99021, to inhibit synaptic NMDA receptors was occluded in shRNA-PI4KII transfected neurons. The effects of knocking down PI4KII knockdown were fully rescued by a shRNA-resistant wild type construct but could not be rescued by a mutant construct that was unable to be phosphorylated by GSK-3{beta}. The data suggest that GSK-3{beta} phosphorylates PI4KII to stabilize the expression of synaptic NMDA receptors.",

    "abstract": "Early impairments to neurovascular coupling have been proposed to be a key pathogenic factor in the onset and progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). Studies have shown impaired neurovascular function in several mouse models of AD, including the J20-hAPP mouse. In this study, we aimed to investigate early neurovascular changes using wild-type (WT) controls and J20-hAPP mice at 6-9 months of age, by measuring cerebral haemodynamics and neural activity to physiological sensory stimulations. A thinned cranial window was prepared to allow access to cortical vasculature and imaged using 2D-optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS). After chronic imaging sessions where the skull was intact, a terminal acute imaging session was performed where an electrode was inserted into the brain to record simultaneous neural activity. We found that cerebral haemodynamic changes were significantly enhanced in J20-hAPP mice compared with controls in response to physiological stimulations, potentially due to the significantly higher neural activity (hyperexcitability) seen in the J20-hAPP mice. Thus, neurovascular coupling remained preserved under a chronic imaging preparation. Further, under hyperoxia, the baseline blood volume and saturation of all vascular compartments in the brains of J20-hAPP mice were substantially enhanced compared to WT controls, but this effect disappeared under normoxic conditions. This study highlights novel findings not previously seen in the J20-hAPP mouse model, and may point towards a potential therapeutic strategy by driving an increased baseline blood flow to the brain, thereby potentially enhancing the clearance of beta-amyloid.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlternative splicing (AS), which generates multiple mRNA isoforms from single genes, is crucial for the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. The flux through competing AS pathways cannot be determined by traditional RNA-Seq, however, because different mRNA isoforms can have widely differing decay rates. Indeed, some mRNA isoforms with extremely short half-lives, such as those subject to translation-dependent nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD), may be completely overlooked in even the most extensive RNA-Seq analyses.\n\nResultsRNA immunoprecipitation in tandem (RIPiT) of exon junction complex (EJC) components allows for purification of post-splicing mRNA-protein particles (mRNPs) not yet subject to translation (pre-translational mRNPs) and, therefore, translation-dependent mRNA decay. Here we compared EJC RIPiT-Seq to whole cell RNA-Seq data from HEK293 cells. Consistent with expectation, the flux through known AS-NMD pathways is substantially higher than that captured by RNA-Seq. Our EJC RIPiT-Seq also definitively demonstrates that the splicing machinery itself has no ability to detect reading frame. We identified thousands of previously unannotated splicing events; while many can be attributed to \"splicing noise\", others are evolutionarily-conserved events that produce new AS-NMD isoforms likely involved in maintenance of protein homeostasis. Several of these occur in genes whose overexpression has been linked to poor cancer prognosis.\n\nConclusionsDeep sequencing of RNAs in post-splicing, pre-translational mRNPs provides a means to identify and quantify splicing events without the confounding influence of differential mRNA decay. For many known AS-NMD targets, the NMD-linked AS pathway predominates. EJC RIPiT-Seq also enabled identification of numerous conserved but previously unannotated AS-NMD events.",

    "abstract": "Genetic perturbation screening is an experimental method in biology to study cause and effect relationships between different biological entities. However, knocking out or knocking down genes is a highly error-prone process that complicates estimation of the effect sizes of the interventions. Here, we introduce a family of generative models, called the structured hierarchical model (SHM), for probabilistic inference of causal effects from perturbation screens. SHMs utilize classical hierarchical models to represent heterogeneous data and combine them with categorical Markov random fields to encode biological prior information over functionally related biological entities. The random field induces a clustering of functionally related genes which informs inference of parameters in the hierarchical model. The SHM is designed for extremely noisy data sets for which the true data generating process is difficult to model due to lack of domain knowledge or high stochasticity of the interventions. We apply the SHM to a pan-cancer genetic perturbation screen in order to identify genes that restrict the growth of an entire group of cancer cell lines and show that incorporating prior knowledge in the form of a graph improves inference of parameters.",

Numerous sgRNA design tools have been developed based on reference genomes for humans and model organisms.

To facilitate identification of sgRNAs (1) in non-reference genomes, (2) across varying genetic backgrounds, or (3) for specific targeting of SNP-containing alleles, for example, disease relevant mutations, we developed a web tool, SNP-CRISPR (https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/snp_crispr/). SNP-CRISPR can be used to design sgRNAs based on public variant data sets or user-identified variants. In addition, the tool computes efficiency and specificity scores for sgRNA designs targeting both the variant and the reference. Moreover, SNP-CRISPR provides the option to upload multiple SNPs and target single or multiple nearby base changes simultaneously with a single sgRNA design. Given these capabilities, SNP-CRISPR has a wide range of potential research applications in model systems and for design of sgRNAs for disease-associated variant correction.",

Since multiple Arabidopsis PIPs are implicated in conducting carbon dioxide across membranes, we focused on identifying whether the examined isoforms affect photosynthesis, either mediated through the control of stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) or mesophyll conductance of CO2 (gm) or a combination of both. In two separate studies, we grew Arabidopsis plants in a low humidity environment and under high humidity conditions. We found that the contribution of functional PIPs to gs was larger under conditions of low air humidity when the evaporative demand was high, whereas any effect of lacking PIP function was minimal under higher humidity conditions. The pip2;4 knockout mutants had 44% higher gs than the WT under low humidity conditions, which in turn resulted in an increased photosynthetic rate (Anet). AtPIP2;4 is thus likely to be involved in maintaining a positive water balance and high water use efficiency through mediation of transmembrane water flow. The lack of functional AtPIP2;5 on the other hand did not affect gs, but reduced gm indicating a possible role in regulating CO2 membrane permeability. This potential regulatory function was indeed confirmed by subsequent stopped flow measurements of yeast expressing AtPIP2;5.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is orchestrated by a complicated mechanochemical system. However, few cell migration models take account of the coupling between a biochemical network and mechanical factors. Here, we construct a mechanochemical cell migration model to study the cell tension effect on cell migration. Our model incorporates the interactions between Rac-GTP, Rac-GDP, F-actin, myosin, and cell tension, and it is based on phase field approach hence very convenient in describing the cell shape change. This model captures common features of cell polarization, cell shape change, and cell migration modes. It shows cell tension inhibits migration ability monotonically when cells are applied with persistent external stimuli. On the other hand, if random internal noise is significant, the regulation of cell tension exerts a non-monotonic effect on cell migration. As the elevation of cell tension impedes the formation of multiple protrusions hence enhances the streamline position of the cell body. Therefore the migration ability could be maximized at intermediate cell tension under random internal noise. These model predictions are consistent with our singlecell experiments and other experimental results.\n\nStatement of significanceCell migration plays a vital role in many biological processes such as tumor metastasis. It is a complicated process regulated by dynamic coupling between the biochemical network and mechanical forces. However, few cell migration models take account of both factors. Here, we construct a mechanochemical cell migration model to study how cell migration is regulated by cell tension. Our model predicts that cell tension not only inhibits cell movement under persistent external stimuli but also prompts cell migration under random internal noise when cell tension is low. Therefore an optimized cell tension could maximize the migration ability under random internal noise. We further confirmed these model predictions are consistent with our single-cell experiments and other published experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Besides acting as growth inducing molecule, Gibberellin (GA3) also confers the compatibility of microbial interactions with host. We inoculated 11 days old Z. mays seedlings grown under hydroponic conditions and high GA3 levels with Bipolaris sorokiniana (BIPOL) at the spore density (SD) of OD0.6. The high level of GA3 negatively affected the growth of the seedlings, accompanied by the high level of stress deducing secondary metabolites (proline, total flavanoids, phenylpropanoids, and glucosinolides). Moreover, high level of GA3 produced a hypersensitive response (HR) in the seedlings. The HR developed cross talks with IAA and trans-zeatins and triggered higher production of hypersensitive inducing biomolecules. The other HR co-related biological processes were demonstrated by high phytoalexins level and high protease activities. Such activities ultimately inhibited the colonization of BIPOL on the roots of maize seedlings. The products of the genes expressed at high GA3 also conferred the deterrence of BIPOL colonization at SD = OD0.6. Intriguingly, when we inhibited GA3 biosynthesis in the seedlings with aerially sprayed uniconizole, prior to BIPOL treatment, the BIPOL colonized and subsequently promoted the seedling growth. This low level of GA3 after BIPOL treatment checked the high level of secondary metabolites and hypersensitivity inducing molecules. The results, thus suggested that the aforementioned processes only happened in the BIPOL at SD (OD0.6), whereas the SD at lower levels (OD0.2 or OD0.4) neither promoted the growth of uniconizole pre-treated seedlings nor produced HR in control seedlings of maize plant.",

    "abstract": "Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is a chemical compound found in extracts derived from the Chinese medicinal plant. Due to its remarkable therapeutic effects, availability, and low cost and toxicity, TMP has been used to treat cardiovascular diseases and pulmonary hypertension in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism of TMP on lung development using a rat model of nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Pregnant rats were divided into three groups: control, CDH, and CDH+TMP. Nitrofen was used to induce CDH. In the CDH and CDH+TMP, Fetuses only with left diaphragmatic hernias were chosen for analysis. Lung and body weight were recorded and lung histologic evaluations, image analysis, and western blot analysis of YAP, p-YAP and LATS1 were performed after lung processing. A marked abnormal structure was observed, as evidenced by pulmonary hypoplasia and vascular remodeling, in the CDH. These abnormalities were improved in the CDH+TMP. There were significant differences between the CDH and CDH+TMP in percentage of medial wall thickness, arteriole muscularization, radial alveolar counts, AA%, and alveolar septal thickness. YAP expression was markedly increased in the CDH compared to the control, which was not affected by antenatal TMP administration. However, prenatal TMP intervention significantly increased expression of LATS1 and phosphorylation of YAP in the CDH fetuses. Our results demonstrate that antenatal TMP administration improved vascular remodeling and promoted lung development in a rat model of CDH, potentially through increasing expression of LATS1 and phosphorylation of YAP.",

    "abstract": "Grazing by zooplankton can maintain diversity in phytoplankton communities by allowing coexistence between competitors in situations that would otherwise lead to competitive exclusion. In mathematical models, grazing is represented by a functional response that describes the consumption rate by an individual zooplankter as a function of phytoplankton concentration. Since its initial description, the Kill-the-Winner functional response has been increasingly adopted for large-scale biogeochemical modeling. Here, we analyze how two properties of the Kill-the-Winner functional response--preference and switching--interact to promote coexistence and increase diversity in two simple models: a diamond-shaped nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model and a size-structured phytoplankton community model. We found that, compared to preference, switching leads to coexistence and increased diversity over a much wider range of environmental conditions (nutrient supply and mixing rate). In the absence of switching, preference only allows for coexistence within the narrow range of environmental conditions where the preference is precisely balanced against the competitive difference between phytoplankton types. We also explored a counterintuitive aspect of the Kill-the-Winner functional response that we have termed \"synergistic grazing\". Synergistic grazing occurs when the grazing rate on one phytoplankton type increases as the biomass of an alternative phytoplankton type increases. This unrealistic effect is most evident when switching is strong and when zooplankton have a preference for the weaker competitor.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular lifestyle of Salmonella enterica is characterized by the formation of a replication-permissive membrane-bound niche, the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). A further consequence of the massive remodeling of the host cell endosomal system, intracellular Salmonella establish a unique network of various Salmonella-induced tubules (SIT). The bacterial repertoire of effector proteins required for the establishment for one type of these SIT, the Salmonella-induced filaments (SIF), is rather well-defined. However, the corresponding host cell proteins are still poorly understood. To identify host factors required for the formation of SCV and SIF, we performed a sub-genomic RNAi screen. The analyses comprised high-resolution live cell imaging to score effects on SIF induction, dynamics and morphology. The hits of our functional RNAi screen comprise: i) The late endo-/lysosomal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex, consisting of STX7, STX8, VTI1B, and VAMP7 or VAMP8, this is, in conjunction with RAB7 and the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, a complete vesicle fusion machinery. ii) Novel interactions with the early secretory GTPases RAB1A and RAB1B, possibly providing a link to coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles and reinforcing recently identified ties to the endoplasmic reticulum. iii) New connections to the late secretory pathway and/or the recycling endosome via the GTPases RAB3A, RAB8A, and RAB8B and the SNAREs VAMP2, VAMP3, and VAMP4. iv) An unprecedented involvement of clathrin-coated structures. The resulting set of hits allowed to characterize completely new host factor interactions, and strengthen observations from several previous studies.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium induces the reorganization of the endosomal system of mammalian host cells. This activity is dependent on translocated effector proteins of the pathogen. The host cells factors required for endosomal remodeling are only partially known. To identify such factors for formation and dynamics of endosomal compartments in Salmonella-infected cell, we performed a live cell imaging-based RNAi screen a to investigate the role of 496 mammalian proteins involved in cellular logistics. We identified that endosomal remodeling by intracellular Salmonella dependent on host factors in following functional classes: i) the late endo-/lysosomal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex, ii) the early secretory pathway, represented by regulators GTPases RAB1A and RAB1B, iii) the late secretory pathway and/or recycling endosomes represented by GTPases RAB3A, RAB8A, RAB8B, and the SNAREs VAMP2, VAMP3, and VAMP4, and iv) clathrin-coated structures. The identification of these new host factors provides further evidence for the complex manipulation of host cell transport functions by intracellular Salmonella and should enable detailed follow-up studies on the mechanisms involved.",

    "abstract": "Unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) were used to phenotype growth trajectories of inbred maize populations under field conditions. Three recombinant inbred line populations were surveyed on a weekly basis collecting RGB images across two irrigation regimens (irrigated and non-irrigated/rain fed). Plant height, estimated by the 95th percentile (P95) height from UAS generated 3D point clouds, exceeded 70% correlation to manual ground truth measurements and 51% of experimental variance was explained by genetics. The Weibull sigmoidal function accurately modeled plant growth (R2: >99%; RMSE: < 4 cm) from P95 genetic means. The mean asymptote was strongly correlated (r2=0.66-0.77) with terminal plant height. Maximum absolute growth rates (mm d-1) were weakly correlated to height and flowering time. The average inflection point ranged from 57 to 60 days after sowing (DAS) and was correlated with flowering time (r2=0.45-0.68). Functional growth parameters (asymptote, inflection point, growth rate) alone identified 34 genetic loci, each explaining 3 to 15% of total genetic variation. Plant height was estimated at one-day intervals to 85 DAS, identifying 58 unique temporal quantitative trait loci (QTL) locations. Genomic hotspots on chromosome 1 and 3 indicated chromosomal regions associated with functional growth trajectories influencing flowering time, growth rate, and terminal growth. Temporal QTL demonstrated unique dynamic expression patterns not observable previously, no QTL were significantly expressed throughout the entire growing season. UAS technologies improved phenotypic selection accuracy and permitted monitoring traits on a temporal scale previously infeasible using manual measurements, furthering understanding of crop development and biological trajectories.\n\nAuthor summaryUnoccupied aerial systems (UAS) now can provide high throughput phenotyping to functionally model plant growth and explore genetic loci underlying temporal expression of dynamic phenotypes, specifically plant height. Efficient integration of temporal phenotyping via UAS, will improve the scientific understanding of dynamic, quantitative traits and developmental trajectories of important agronomic crops, leading to new understanding of plant biology. Here we present, for the first time, the dynamic nature of quantitative trait loci (QTL) over time under field conditions. To our knowledge, this is first empirical study to expand beyond selective developmental time points, evaluating functional and temporal QTL expression in maize (Zea mays L.) throughout a growing season within a field-based environment.",
