    "abstract": "Orienting responses (ORs) are whole-organism reflexes that are elicited by innocuous stimuli, and which decrease in magnitude after stimulus repetition. ORs represent relatively simple responses that can be used to study attentional processes, and are modulated by the organism\u2019s state, including arousal and activation levels, as well as by emotional processes. Here we describe a simple method to study ORs in zebrafish, a model organism increasingly being used in behavioural neuroscience. After presentation of a static visual stimulus, an OR is elicited, characterized by approaching the stimulus and orienting towards it. After repeated stimulation, OR decreases, suggesting habituation. These responses are qualitatively altered by exposure to a fear-eliciting alarm substance (i.e., derived from the skin of a conspecific), since exposed animals avoid the visual stimulus and orient either away from the stimulus or towards it, but at a distance. The protocol can be used to study orienting responses, as well as the impact of fear and arousal on these reflexes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) overload in response to chronic overnutrition is a prominent pathophysiological mechanism in obesity-induced metabolic disease. Increased disposal of FAs is therefore an attractive strategy for intervening in obesity and related disorders. Skeletal muscle uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) activity is associated with increased FA oxidation and antagonizes weight gain in mice on obesogenic diets, but the mechanisms involved are not clear. Here, we show that UCP3 forms a direct, FA-stimulated, mitochondrial matrix-localized complex with the auxiliary unsaturated FA-metabolizing enzyme, {Delta}3,5-{Delta}2,4dienoyl-CoA-isomerase (ECH1). Expression studies in C2C12 myoblasts that functionally augments state 4 (uncoupled) respiration and FA oxidation in skeletal myocytes.\\n\\nMechanistic studies indicate that ECH1:UCP3 complex formation is likely stimulated by FA import into the mitochondria to enhance uncoupled respiration and unsaturated FA oxidation in mouse skeletal myocytes. In order to characterize the contribution of ECH1-dependent FA metabolism in NST, we generated an ECH1 knockout mouse and found that these mice were severely cold intolerant, despite an up-regulation of UCP3 expression in SKM. These findings illuminate a novel mechanism that links unsaturated FA metabolism with mitochondrial uncoupling and non-shivering thermogenesis in SKM.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cells are well-known to be modulated by extracellular mechanical factors including substrate stiffness. However, the effect of substrate stiffness on an epithelial cells principal function -creating an effective barrier to protect the underlying tissue - cannot be directly measured using existing experimental techniques. We developed a strategy involving ethylenediamine aminolysis and glutaraldehyde crosslinking to chemically graft polyacrylamide hydrogels with tunable stiffness to PET Transwell membranes. Grafting success was evaluated using spectroscopic methods, scrape tests, and extended incubation in culture. By assessing apical to basolateral transfer of fluorescent tracers, we demonstrated that our model is permeable to biologically relevant molecules and usable for direct measurement of barrier function by calculating paracellular permeability.\\n\\nWe found that BEAS-2B epithelial cells form a more effective barrier on stiff substrates, likely attributable to increased cell spreading. We also observed barrier impairment after treatment with transforming growth factor beta, indicating loss of cell-cell junctions, validating our models ability to detect biologically relevant stimuli. Thus, we have created an experimental model that allows explicit measurement of epithelial barrier function for cells grown on different substrate stiffnesses. This model will be a valuable tool to study mechanical regulation of epithelial and endothelial barrier function in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Macrophage activity is a major component of the healthy response to infection and injury that consists of tightly regulated early pro-inflammatory activation followed by anti-inflammatory and regenerative activity. In numerous diseases, however, macrophage polarization becomes dysregulated and can not only impair recovery, but can also promote further injury and pathogenesis, e.g. after injury, in diabetes, or in Alzheimers disease. Dysregulated macrophages may either fail to polarize or become chronically polarized, resulting in increased production of cytotoxic factors, diminished capacity to clear pathogens, or failure to promote tissue regeneration. In these cases, a method of predicting and dynamically controlling macrophage polarization will enable a new strategy for treating diverse inflammatory diseases. In this work, we developed a model-predictive control framework to temporally regulate macrophage polarization. Using RAW 264.7 macrophages as a model system, we enabled temporal control by identifying transfer function models relating the polarization marker iNOS to exogenous pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli. These stimuli-to-iNOS response models were identified using linear autoregressive with exogenous input terms (ARX) equations and were coupled with nonlinear elements to account for experimentally identified supra-additive and hysteretic effects. Using this model architecture, we were able to reproduce experimentally observed temporal iNOS dynamics induced with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}). Moreover, the identified model enabled the design of time-varying input trajectories to experimentally sustain the duration and magnitude of iNOS expression. By designing transfer function models with the intent to predict cell behavior, we were able to predict and experimentally obtain temporal regulation of iNOS expression using LPS and IFN-{gamma} from both naive and non-naive initial states. Moreover, our data driven models revealed decaying magnitude of iNOS response to LPS stimulation over time that could be recovered using combined treatment with both LPS and IFN-{gamma}.

    "abstract": "Currently, the standard practice for assembling next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads of viral genomes is to summarize thousands of individual short reads into a single consensus sequence, thus confounding useful intra-host diversity information for molecular phylodynamic inference. It is hypothesized that a few viral strains may dominate the intra-host genetic diversity with a variety of lower frequency strains comprising the rest of the population. Several software tools currently exist to convert NGS sequence variants into haplotypes. However, previous studies suggest that current approaches of haplotype reconstruction greatly underestimate intra-host diversity. Here, we tested twelve NGS haplotype reconstruction methods using viral populations simulated under realistic evolutionary dynamics. Parameters for the simulated data spanned known fast evolving viruses (e.g., HIV-1) diversity estimates to test the limits of the haplotype reconstruction methods and ensured coverage of predicted intra-host viral diversity levels. Using those parameters, we simulated HIV-1 viral populations of 216-1,185 haplotypes per host at a frequency <7%. All twelve investigated haplotype callers showed variable performance and produced drastically different results that were mainly driven by differences in mutation rate and, to a lesser extent, in effective population size. Most methods were able to accurately reconstruct haplotypes when genetic diversity was low. However, under higher levels of diversity (e.g., those seen intra-host HIV-1 infections), haplotype reconstruction accuracy was highly variable and, on average, poor. High diversity levels led to severe underestimation of, with a few tools greatly overestimating, the true number of haplotypes. PredictHaplo and PEHaplo produced estimates close to the true number of haplotypes, although their haplotype reconstruction accuracy was worse than that of the other ten tools. We conclude that haplotype reconstruction from NGS short reads is unreliable due to high genetic diversity of fast-evolving viruses. Local haplotype reconstruction of longer reads to phase variants may provide a more reliable estimation of viral variants within a population.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIHaplotype callers for NGS data vary greatly in their performance.\\nC_LIO_LIHaplotype callers performance is mainly determined by mutation rate.\\nC_LIO_LIHaplotype callers performance is less sensitive to effective population size.\\nC_LIO_LIMost haplotype callers perform well with low diversity and poorly with high diversity.\\nC_LIO_LIPredictHaplo performs best if genetic diversity is in the range of HIV diversity.\\nC_LI",

Bioengineered models of the TME will advance our understanding of cancer progression and facilitate identification of novel anti-cancer therapeutics that target TME components such as extracellular matrix (ECM) and stromal cells. However, most current in vitro models fail to recapitulate the extensive features of the human tumor stroma, especially ECM architecture, and are not exposed to intact body physiology. On the other hand, in vivo animal models do not accurately capture human tumor architecture. Using the features of biopsied colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue as a guide, we address these deficiencies by creating human organoids containing a colonic stromal ECM layer and CRC spheroids. Organoids were studied in vitro and upon implantation in mice for 28 days. We show that the stromal ECM micro-architecture, generated in vitro, was maintained in vivo for at least 28 days. Furthermore, comparisons with biopsied CRC tumors revealed that organoids with orderly structured TMEs induce an epithelial phenotype in CRC cells, similar to low-grade tumors, compared to a mesenchymal phenotype observed in disordered TMEs, similar to high-grade tumors. Altogether, these results are the first demonstration of replicating the human tumor ECM architecture in biofabricated tumor organoids under ex vivo and in vivo conditions.",

Three chemostat models (A, B and C) were used to investigate the effects of three rifaximin formulations (, {beta} and {kappa}, respectively) on the gut microbiome. Bacterial populations were monitored by bacterial culture and 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S) sequencing. Limited disruption of bacterial populations was observed for rifaximin , {beta} and {kappa}. All formulations caused declines in total spores ([~]2 log10 cfu ml-1), Enterococcus spp. ([~]2 log10 cfu ml-1 in models A and C, and [~]1 log10 cfu ml-1 in model B), and Bacteroides spp. populations ([~]3 log10 cfu ml-1 in models A and C, and [~]4 log10 cfu ml-1 in model B). Bacterial populations fully recovered during antibiotic dosing in model C, and before the end of the experiment in models A and B. According to the taxonomic analysis, prior to rifaximin exposure, Bifidobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae families represented >92% of the total relative abundance, in all models. Within these families, 15 bacterial genera represented >99% of the overall relative abundance. Overall, the 16S sequencing and culture data showed similar variations in the bacterial populations studied.

    "abstract": "A large proportion of membrane proteins must be assembled into oligomeric complexes for function. How this process occurs is poorly understood, but it is clear that complex assembly must be tightly regulated to avoid accumulation of orphan subunits with potential cytotoxic effects. We interrogated assembly in mammalian cells using a model system of the WRB/CAML complex: an essential insertase for tail-anchored proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our data suggests that the stability of each subunit is differentially regulated. In WRBs absence, CAML folds incorrectly, causing aberrant exposure of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain to the cytosol. When present, WRB can post-translationally correct the topology of CAML both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, WRB can independently fold correctly, but is still degraded in the absence of CAML. We therefore propose at least two distinct regulatory pathways for the surveillance of orphan subunits during complex assembly in the mammalian ER.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeuroimaging methods including fMRI provide powerful tools to observe whole-brain functional networks. This is particularly powerful in animal models, allowing these networks to be probed using complementary methods. However, most animals must be anesthetized for neuroimaging, giving rise to complications resulting from anesthetic effects on the animals physiological and neurological functions. For example, an established protocol for feline neuroimaging involves co-administration of ketamine and isoflurane - the latter of which is known to suppress cortical function.\n\nNew MethodHere, we compare this established protocol to alfaxalone, a single-agent anesthetic for functional neuroimaging. We first compare the two in a controlled environment to assess relative safety and to measure physiological stability over an extended time window. We then compare patterns of auditory and visually-evoked activity measured at 7T to assess mean signal strength and between-subjects signal variability.\n\nResults in Comparison with Existing MethodsWe show that alfaxalone results in more stable respiratory rates over the 120 minutes testing period, with evidence of smaller between measurements variability within this time window, when compared to ketamine plus isoflurane. Moreover, we demonstrate that both agents evoke similar mean BOLD signals across animals, but that alfaxalone elicits more consistent BOLD activity in response to sound stimuli across all ROIs observed.\n\nConclusionsAlfaxalone is observed to be more physiologically stable, evoking a more consistent BOLD signal across animals than the co-administration of ketamine and isoflurane. Thus, an alfaxalone-based protocol may represent a better approach for neuroimaging in animal models requiring anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing data have complex features such as dropout events, over-dispersion, and high-magnitude outliers, resulting in complicated probability distributions of mRNA abundances that are statistically characterized in terms of a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model. Here we provide a mesoscopic kinetic foundation of the widely used ZINB model based on the biochemical reaction kinetics underlying transcription. Using multiscale modeling and simplification techniques, we show that the ZINB distribution of mRNA abundance and the phenomenon of transcriptional bursting naturally emerge from a three-state stochastic transcription model. We further reveal a nontrivial quantitative relation between dropout events and transcriptional bursting, which provides novel insights into how and to what extent the burst size and burst frequency could reduce the dropout rate. Three different biophysical origins of over-dispersion are also clarified at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeuromodulation by transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) offers the potential to non-invasively treat specific brain regions, with treatment location verified by magnetic resonance acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI).\\n\\nObjectiveTo investigate the safety of these methods prior to widespread clinical use, we report histologic findings in two large animal models following FUS neuromodulation and MR-ARFI.\\n\\nMethodsTwo rhesus macaques and thirteen Dorset sheep were studied. FUS neuromodulation was targeted to the primary visual cortex in rhesus macaques and to subcortical locations, verified by MR-ARFI, in eleven sheep. Both rhesus macaques and five sheep received a single FUS session, whereas six sheep received repeated sessions three to six days apart. The remaining two control sheep did not receive ultrasound but otherwise underwent the same anesthetic and MRI procedures as the eleven experimental sheep. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of brain tissue (harvested zero to eleven days following FUS) were evaluated for tissue damage at FUS and control locations as well as tissue within the path of the FUS beam. TUNEL staining was used to evaluate for the presence of apoptosis in sheep receiving high dose FUS.\\n\\nResultsNo FUS-related pre-mortem histologic findings were observed in the rhesus macaques or in any of the examined sheep. Extravascular red blood cells (RBCs) were present within the meninges of all sheep, regardless of treatment group. Similarly, small aggregates of perivascular RBCs were rarely noted in non-target regions of neural parenchyma of FUS-treated (8/11) and untreated (2/2) sheep. However, no concurrent histologic abnormalities were observed, consistent with RBC extravasation occurring as post-mortem artifact following brain extraction. Sheep within the high dose FUS group were TUNEL-negative at the targeted site of FUS.\\n\\nConclusionsThe absence of FUS-related histologic findings suggests that the neuromodulation and MR-ARFI protocols evaluated do not cause tissue damage.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen deprivation within tumors is one of the most prevalent causes of resilient cancer cell survival and increased immune evasion in breast cancer (BCa). Current in vitro models do not adequately mimic physiological oxygen levels relevant to breast tissue and its tumor-immune interactions. Here, we propose an approach to engineer a three-dimensional (3D) model (named 3D engineered oxygen, 3D-O) that supports growth of BCa cells and generates physio- and pathophysiological oxygen levels. Low oxygen-induced changes within the 3D-O model supported known tumor hypoxia characteristics such as reduced BCa cell proliferation, increased extracellular matrix protein expression, increased extracellular vesicle secretion and enhanced immune surface marker expression on BCa cells. We further demonstrated that low oxygen-induced changes mimicked tumor-immune interactions leading to immune evasion mechanisms. CD8+ T cell infiltration was significantly impaired under pathophysiological oxygen levels and we were able to establish that hypoxia inhibition re-sensitize BCa cells to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Therefore, our novel 3D-O model could serve as a promising platform for the evaluation of immunological events and as a drug-screening platform tool to overcome hypoxia-driven immune evasion.",

Mitochondria are now emerging as regulators of mammalian cell motility. Here we show that mitochondria infiltrate the leading edge of NIH3T3 fibroblasts during migration. At the leading edge, we find that mitochondria move to and tether to Focal Adhesions (FA). FA regulate cell migration by coupling the cytoskeleton to the Extracellular Matrix through integrin receptors.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty in risks posed by emerging stressors such as synthetic hormones impedes conservation efforts for threatened vertebrate populations. Synthetic hormones often induce sex-biased perturbations in exposed animals by disrupting gonad development and early life-history stage transitions, potentially diminishing per capita reproductive output of depleted populations and, in turn, being manifest as Allee effects. We use a spatially-explicit biophysical model to evaluate how sex-biased perturbation in life history traits of individuals (maternal investment in egg production and male-skewed sex allocation in offspring) modulates density feedback control of year class strength and recovery trajectories of a long-lived, migratory fish-shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus)-under spatially and temporally dynamic synthetic androgen exposure and habitat conditions. Simulations show that reduced efficiency of maternal investment in gonad development prolonged maturation time, increased the probability of skipped spawning, and, in turn, gradually shrunk spawner abundance, weakening year class strength. However, positive density feedback quickly disappeared (no Allee effect) once the exposure ceased. By contrast, responses to the demographic perturbation manifested as strong positive density feedback; an abrupt shift in year class strength and spawner abundance followed after more than two decades owing to persistent negative population growth (a strong Allee effect), reaching an alternate state without any sign of recovery. When combined with the energetic perturbation, positive density feedback of the demographic perturbation was dampened as extended maturation time reduced the frequency of producing male-biased offspring, allowing the population to maintain positive growth rate (a weak Allee effect) and gradually recover. The emergent patterns in long-term population projections illustrate that sex-biased perturbation in life history traits of individuals can interactively regulate the strength of density feedback in depleted populations such as Scaphirhynchus sturgeon to further diminish reproductive capacity and abundance, posing increasingly greater conservation challenges in chemically altered riverscapes.",

    "abstract": "Evidence for pollinator declines largely originates from mid-latitude regions in North America and Europe. Geographical heterogeneity in pollinator trends combined with geographical biases in pollinator studies, can produce distorted extrapolations and limit understanding of pollinator responses to environmental changes. In contrast to the declines experienced in some well-investigated European and North American regions, honeybees seem to have increased recently in some areas of the Mediterranean Basin. Since honeybees can impact negatively on wild bees, it was hypothesized that a biome-wide alteration in bee pollinator assemblages may be underway in the Mediterranean Basin involving a reduction in the importance of wild bees as pollinators. This hypothesis was tested using published quantitative data on bee pollinators of wild and cultivated plants from studies conducted between 1963-2017 in 13 circum-Mediterranean countries. Honeybee colonies increased exponentially and wild bees were gradually replaced by honeybees in flowers of wild and cultivated plants. Proportion of wild bees at flowers quadruplicated that of honeybees at the beginning of the period, the proportions of both groups becoming roughly similar fifty years later. The Mediterranean Basin is a world biodiversity hotspot for wild bees and wild bee-pollinated plants, and the ubiquitous rise of honeybees to dominance as pollinators could in the long run undermine the diversity of plants and wild bees in the region.",

This FPAuhf feature may serve as robust real-time decoding strategy from large-scale (up to 100,000 electrodes) recordings in closed-loop experiments. Furthermore, we developed unsupervised learning approaches to extract low-dimensional spatiotemporal FPAuhf features during run and ripple periods, and to infer latent dynamical structures from lower-rank FPAuhf features. We also developed a novel optical flow-based method to identify propagating spatiotemporal LFP patterns from multi-site array recordings, which can be used for decoding application. Finally, we developed a prospective decoding strategy to predict animals future decision in goal-directed navigation.",

Interestingly, EMT is not a binary process but instead proceeds with multiple partial intermediate states. However, the functions of these intermediate states are not fully understood. Here, we focus on a general question about how the number of partial EMT states affects cell transformation. First, by fitting a hidden Markov model of EMT with experimental data, we propose a statistical mechanism for EMT in which many unobservable microstates may exist within one of the observable macrostates. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of intermediate states can accelerate the EMT process and that adding parallel paths or transition layers accelerates the process even further. Last, a stabilized intermediate state traps cells in one partial EMT state. This work advances our understanding of the dynamics and functions of EMT plasticity during cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Mate choice is a complex decision that requires the integration of cues from potential mates with individual preferences. Choosers preferences are shaped by recent events, early life experience and by the evolutionary history of its own species. To better understand the interaction between these factors, we studied mate choice in the female house mouse, Mus musculus. Females of one of the musculus subspecies, Mus musculus musculus, show preference for males of their own subspecies compared to males of the sibling subspecies, Mus musculus domesticus. Such an assortative preference is ecologically relevant at contact zones, where it contributes to the reproductive isolation of sympatric populations and can be reproduced in controlled laboratory conditions, but its origins are still under debate. Here, we show that female mouse mate choice depends on both early postnatal life experience and the order of prospective mates encountered as an adult and that these effects interact asymmetrically. Whereas females raised in their normal M. m. musculus environment display a robust assortative preference, females fostered in a M. m. domesticus family prefer the first male encountered, regardless of subspecies. Thus, early life experience of M. m. musculus females, when concordant with genetic self-identity, overrides sampling order effects, ensuring robust assortative choice. In the absence of this match between phylogeny and early life experience, first impression effects dominate mate choice.",

    "abstract": "Symsagittifera roscoffensis is a small marine worm found in the intertidal zone of sandy beaches around the European shores of the Atlantic. S. roscoffensis is a member of the Acoelomorpha, a group of flatworms formerly classified with the Platyhelminthes, but now recognised as Xenacoelomorpha, a separate phylum of disputed affinity. We have used electron microscopy to examine the process of spermiogenesis (the final stage of spermatogenesis) in S. roscoffensis, by which spermatids form highly elongated spermatozoa. Their nuclei are long and thread-like, running most of the cells length and during the process a pair of flagella are fully incorporated into the cell body. Two previously undescribed inter-organelle contact sites form at different stages of spermiogenesis. Strikingly, there is an extensive nucleus-plasma membrane contact site. Golgi-derived granules containing electron-dense filaments line up along the spermatid plasma membrane, undergo a conformational change, and donate material that forms a peri-nuclear layer that cements this contact site. We also show in earlier stage spermatids that the same granules are associated with microtubules, presumably for traffic along the elongating cell. We identify a second spermiogenesis-specific contact site where sheaths engulfing each internalising flagellum contact the nuclear envelope. Finally, detailed studies of the spermatozoon axonemes show that the central keel has varying numbers of microtubules along the length of the cell, and is likely to be a centriole derivative.\\n\\nSummary sentenceDuring spermiogenesis in the acoel flatworm Symsagittifera roscoffensis, two previously unidentified contact sites contribute to the structure of the mature spermatozoon and the axonemal structures show direct continuity between doublet and dense core microtubules.",

Using this strategy, we generated hey2zCKOIS which served as a hey2 KI reporter with EGFP expression. Upon Cre induction in targeted cells, the hey2zCKOIS was switched to a non-functional CKO allele hey2zCKOIS-inv associated with TagRFP expression, enabling to visualize CKO alleles. Thus, the simplification of the design, and the visibility and combination of both CKO and KI alleles engineering make our zCKOIS strategy an applicable CKO approach for zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Rare genetic variants make significant contributions to human diseases. Compared to common variants, rare variants have larger effect sizes and are generally free of linkage disequilibrium (LD), which makes it easier to identify causal variants. Numerous methods have been developed to analyze rare variants in a gene or region in association studies, with the goal of finding risk genes by aggregating information of all variants of a gene. These methods, however, often make unrealistic assumptions, e.g. all rare variants in a risk gene would have non-zero effects. In practice, current methods for gene-based analysis often fail to show any advantage over simple single-variant analysis. In this work, we develop a Bayesian method: MIxture model based Rare variant Analysis on GEnes (MIRAGE). MIRAGE captures the heterogeneity of variant effects by treating all variants of a gene as a mixture of risk and non-risk variants, and models the prior probabilities of being risk variants as function of external information of variants, such as allele frequencies and predicted deleterious effects. MIRAGE uses an empirical Bayes approach to estimate these prior probabilities by combining information across genes. We demonstrate in both simulations and analysis of an exome-sequencing dataset of Autism, that MIRAGE significantly outperforms current methods for rare variant analysis. In particular, the top genes identified by MIRAGE are highly enriched with known or plausible Autism risk genes. Our results highlight several novel Autism genes with high Bayesian posterior probabilities and functional connections with Autism. MIRAGE is available at https://xinhe-lab.github.io/mirage.",

    "abstract": "Sleep serves disparate functions, most notably neural repair, metabolite clearance and circuit reorganization, yet the relative importance of these functions remains hotly debated. Here, we create a novel mechanistic framework for understanding and predicting how sleep changes during ontogeny (why babies sleep twice as long as adults) and across phylogeny (why mice sleep roughly five times that of whales). We use this theory to quantitatively distinguish between sleep used for neural reorganization versus repair. We conduct a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of human sleep using total sleep time, cerebral metabolic rate, brain size, synaptic density, and REM sleep (used here to also refer to Active Sleep in infants and children). Our findings reveal an abrupt transition, between 2 and 3 years of age in humans. Specifically, our results show that differences in sleep across phylogeny and during late ontogeny (after 2 or 3 years in humans) are primarily due to sleep functioning for repair or clearance, while changes in sleep during early ontogeny (before 2 - 3 years in humans) primarily support neural reorganization and learning. Moreover, our analysis shows that neuroplastic reorganization occurs primarily in REM sleep but not in NREM. In accordance with the developmental role of neuroplasticity, the percent of time spent in REM sleep is independent of brain size across species but decreases dramatically as brain size grows through development. Furthermore, the ratio of NREM sleep time to awake time emerges as a new invariant across development. This developmental transition and fundamental shift across ontogeny and phylogeny suggests a complex interplay between developmental and evolutionary constraints on sleep.",

    "abstract": "Investigating the behavior of breast cancer cells via reaction kinetics may help unravel the mechanisms that underlie metabolic changes in tumors. However, obtaining human in vivo kinetic data is challenging due to difficulties associated with measuring these parameters. Non-destructive methods of measuring lipid content in live cells, provide a novel approach to quantitatively model lipid synthesis and consumption. In this study, two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) was used to determine metabolic rates via the cells optical redox ratio (ORR) as reported by fluorescence intensity ratios of metabolic coenzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+). Concurrently, coherent Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy was used to probe de novo intracellular lipid content. Combining non-linear optical microscopy and Michaelis-Menten-kinetics based simulations, we isolated fatty acid synthesis/consumption rates and elucidated effects of altered lipid metabolism in T47D breast cancer cells. When treated with 17{beta}-Estradiol (E2), cancer cells showed a 3-fold increase in beta-oxidation rate as well as a 50% increase in cell proliferation rate. Similarly, the rate of de novo lipid synthesis in cancer cells treated with E2 was increased by 60%. Furthermore, we treated T47D cells with etomoxir (ETO) and observed that cancer cells treated with ETO exhibited a [~]70% reduction in {beta}-oxidation. These results show the ability to probe lipid alterations in live cells with minimum interruption, to characterize both glucose and lipid metabolism in breast cancer cells via quantitative kinetic models and parameters.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceCombining non-linear optical microscopy (NLOM) and deuterium labeling provides insight into lipid metabolism in live cancer cells during cancer development and progression. The dynamic metabolic data is modelled with Michaelis-Menten-kinetics to independently quantify the lipid synthesis and utilization in cancer cells. Changes in lipid levels are found to originate from de novo lipid synthesis using glucose as a source, lipid consumption from {beta}-oxidation and lipid consumption from cell proliferation, processes that can separately analyzed with the Michaelis-Menten model. In this work, we isolate fatty acid synthesis/consumption rates and elucidated effects of altered lipid metabolism in T47D breast cancer cells in response to estradiol stimulation and etomoxir treatment, dynamic processes that cannot be easily observed without the application of appropriate models.",

    "abstract": "Many toxins are short, cysteine-rich peptides that are of great interest as novel therapeutic leads and of great concern as lethal biological agents due to their high affinity and specificity for various receptors involved in neuromuscular transmission. To perform initial candidate identification for design of a drug impacting a particular receptor or for threat assessment as a harmful toxin, one requires a set of candidate structures of reasonable accuracy with potential for interaction with the target receptor. In this article, we introduce a graph-based algorithm for identifying good extant template structures from a library of evolutionarily-related cysteine-containing sequences for structural determination of target sequences by homology modeling. We employ this approach to study the conotoxins, a set of toxin peptides produced by the family of aquatic cone snails. Currently, of the approximately six thousand known conotoxin sequences, only about three percent have experimentally characterized three-dimensional structures, leading to a serious bottleneck in identifying potential drug candidates. We demonstrate that the conotoxin template library generated by our approach may be employed to perform homology modeling and greatly increase the number of characterized conotoxin structures. We also show how our approach can guide experimental design by identifying and ranking sequences for structural characterization in a similar manner. Overall, we present and validate an approach for venom structure modeling and employ it to expand the library of extant conotoxin structures by almost 300% through homology modeling employing the template library determined in our approach.",

    "abstract": "Ultraconserved genomic elements (UCEs), are generally treated as independent loci in phylogenetic analyses. The identification pipeline for UCE probes is agnostic to genetic identity, only selecting loci that are highly conserved, single copy, without repeats, and of a particular length. Here we characterized UCEs from 12 phylogenomic studies across the animal tree of life, from birds to marine invertebrates. We found that within vertebrate lineages, UCEs are mostly intronic and intergenic, while in invertebrates, the majority are in exons. We then curated 4 different sets of UCE markers by genomic category from 5 different studies including; birds, mammals, fish, Hymenoptera (ants, wasps and bees) and Coleoptera (beetles). Of genes captured by UCEs, we find that many are represented by 2 or more UCEs, corresponding to non-overlapping segments of a single gene. We considered these UCEs to be non-independent, merged all UCEs that belonged to a particular gene, constructed gene and species trees, and then evaluated the subsequent effect of merging co-genic UCEs on gene and species tree reconstruction. Average bootstrap support for merged UCE gene trees were significantly improved across all datasets. Increased loci length appears to drive this increase in bootstrap support. Additionally, we found that gene trees generated from merged UCEs were more accurate than those generated by unmerged and randomly merged UCEs, based on our simulation study. This modest degree of UCE characterization and curation impacts downstream analyses and demonstrates the advantages of incorporating basic genomic characterizations into phylogenomic analyses.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio metoecus is a recently described and little studied causative agent of opportunistic infections in humans, often coexisting with V. cholerae in aquatic environments. However, the relative abundance of V. metoecus with V. cholerae and their population dynamics in aquatic reservoirs is still unknown. We developed a multiplex qPCR assay with a limit of detection of three copies per reaction to simultaneously quantify total V. metoecus and V. cholerae abundance, as well as the toxigenic and O1 serogroup subpopulations of V. cholerae from environmental samples. Four different genes were targeted as specific markers for individual Vibrio species or subpopulations; viuB, a gene encoding a vibriobactin utilization protein, was used to quantify the total V. cholerae population. The cholera toxin gene ctxA provided an estimation of toxigenic V. cholerae abundance, while the rfbO1 gene specifically detected and quantified V. cholerae belonging to the O1 serogroup, which includes almost all lineages of the species responsible for the majority of past and ongoing cholera pandemics. To measure V. metoecus abundance, the gene mcp, encoding methyl accepting chemotaxis protein, was used. Marker specificity was confirmed by testing several isolates of V. cholerae and V. metoecus alongside negative controls of isolates within and outside of the Vibrio genus. Analysis of environmental water samples collected from four different geographic locations including cholera-endemic (Dhaka, Kuakata and Mathbaria in Bangladesh) and non-endemic (Oyster Pond in Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA) regions showed that V. metoecus was only present in the USA site, recurring seasonally. Within the coastal USA site, the non-toxigenic O1 serogroup represented up to [~]18% of the total V. cholerae population. V. cholerae toxigenic O1 serogroup was absent or present in low abundance in coastal Bangladesh (Kuakata and Mathbaria) but constituted a relatively high proportion of the total V. cholerae population sustained throughout the year in inland Bangladesh (Dhaka). A preference for host/particle attachment was observed, as the majority of cells from both Vibrio species (>90%) were identified in the largest water size fraction sampled, composed of particles or organisms >63 m and their attached bacteria. This is the first study to apply a culture-independent method to quantify V. cholerae or V. metoecus directly in environmental reservoirs of areas endemic and non-endemic for cholera on significant temporal and spatial scales.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCECholera is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate intervention; it is of prime importance to have fast, accurate and sensitive means to detect V. cholerae. Consistent environmental monitoring of the abundance of V. cholerae along with its toxigenic and O1 serogroup subpopulations could facilitate the determination of the actual distribution of this organism in aquatic reservoirs and thus help to predict an outbreak before it strikes. The lack of substantial temporal and spatial environmental sampling, along with specific quantitative measures, has made this goal elusive so far. The same is true for V. metoecus, a close relative of V. cholerae which has been associated with several clinical infections and could likely pose an emerging threat, readily exchanging genetic material with its more famous relative.",

    "abstract": "Genome packaging by nucleosomes is a hallmark of eukaryotes. Histones and the pathways that deposit, remove, and read histone modifications are deeply conserved. Yet, we lack information regarding chromatin landscapes in extant representatives of ancestors of the main groups of eukaryotes and our knowledge of the evolution of chromatin related processes is limited. We used the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha, which diverged from vascular plants 400 Mya, to obtain a whole chromosome genome assembly and explore the chromatin landscape and three-dimensional organization of the genome of early land plants. Based on genomic profiles of ten chromatin marks, we conclude that the relationship between active marks and gene expression is conserved across land plants. In contrast, we observed distinctive features of transposons and repeats in Marchantia compared with flowering plants. Silenced transposons and repeats did not accumulate around centromeres, and a significant proportion of transposons were marked by H3K27me3, which is otherwise dedicated to the transcriptional repression of protein coding genes in flowering plants. Chromatin compartmentalization analyses of Hi-C data revealed that chromatin regions belonging to repressed heterochromatin were densely decorated with H3K27me3 but not H3K9 or DNA methylation as reported in flowering plants. We conclude that in early plants, H3K27me3 played an essential role in heterochromatin function, suggesting an ancestral role of this mark in transposon silencing.",

However, the ecological relevance of microbiome-mediated behavioural plasticity in wild animals is unknown. We presented wild-caught great tits (Parus major) with a problem-solving task and showed that performance was weakly associated with variation in the gut microbiome. We then manipulated the gut microbiome by feeding birds one of two diets that differed in their relative levels of fat, protein and fibre content: an insect diet (low content), or a seed diet (high content). Microbial communities were less diverse among individuals given the insect compared to those on the seed diet. Individuals were less likely to problem-solve after being given the insect diet, and the same microbiota metrics that were altered as a consequence of diet were also those that correlated with variation in problem solving performance. Although the effect on problem-solving behaviour could have been caused by motivational or nutritional differences between our treatments, our results nevertheless raise the possibility that dietary induced changes in the gut microbiota could be an important mechanism underlying individual behavioural plasticity in wild populations.",

    "abstract": "The thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag was successfully used against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-associated thrombocytopenia refractory to immunomodulatory and antiviral drugs. These effects were ascribed to effects of eltrombopag on megakaryocytes. Here, we tested whether eltrombopag may also exert direct antiviral effects. Therapeutic eltrombopag concentrations inhibited HCMV replication in human fibroblasts and adult mesenchymal stem cells infected with six different virus strains and drug-resistant clinical isolates. Eltrombopag also synergistically increased the anti-HCMV activity of the mainstay drug ganciclovir. Time-of-addition experiments suggested that eltrombopag interferes with HCMV replication after virus entry. Eltrombopag was effective in thrombopoietin receptor-negative cells, and addition of Fe3+ prevented the anti-HCMV effects, indicating that it inhibits HCMV replication via iron chelation. This may be of particular interest for the treatment of cytopenias after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as HCMV reactivation is a major reason for transplantation failure. Since therapeutic eltrombopag concentrations are effective against drug-resistant viruses and synergistically increase the effects of ganciclovir, eltrombopag is also a drug repurposing candidate for the treatment of therapy-refractory HCMV disease.",

    "abstract": "Cell shape is regulated by cell adhesion and cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics. Cell shape, adhesion and motility have a complex relationship and understanding them is important in understanding developmental patterning and embryogenesis. Here we show that the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta (PI4KIII{beta}) regulates cell shape, migration and Focal Adhesion (FA) number. PI4KIII{beta} generates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate from phosphatidylinositol and is highly expressed in a subset of human breast cancers. PI4KIII{beta} and the PI4P it generates regulate a variety of cellular functions, ranging from control of Golgi structure, fly fertility and Akt signaling. Here, we show that loss of PI4KIII{beta} expression decreases cell migration and alters cell shape in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The changes are accompanied by an increase in the number of FA in cells lacking PI4KIII{beta}. Furthermore, we find that PI4P-containing vesicles move to the migratory leading-edge during migration and that some of these vesicles tether to and fuse with FA. Fusion is associated with FA disassembly. This suggests a novel regulatory role for PI4KIII{beta} and PI4P in cell adhesion and cell shape maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of functional connectivity are unique at the individual level, enabling test-retest matching algorithms to identify a subject from among a group using only their functional connectome. Recent findings show that accuracies of these algorithms in children increase with age. Relatedly, the persistence of functional connectivity (FC) patterns across tasks and rest also increases with age. This study investigated the hypothesis that within-subject stability and between-subject similarity of the whole-brain pediatric connectome are developmentally relevant outcomes. Using data from 210 help-seeking children and adolescents, ages 6-21 years (Healthy Brain Network Biobank), we computed whole-brain FC matrices for each participant during two different movies (MovieDM and MovieTP) and two runs of task-free rest (all from a single scan session) and fed these matrices to a test-retest matching algorithm. We replicated the finding that matching accuracies for children and youth (ages 6-21 years) are low (18-44%), and that cross-state and cross-movie accuracies were the lowest. Results also showed that parcellation resolution and the number of volumes used in each matrix affect fingerprinting accuracies. Next, we calculated three measures of whole-connectome stability for each subject: cross-rest (Rest1-Rest2), crossstate (MovieDM-Rest1), and cross-movie (MovieDM-MovieTP), and three measures of within-state between-subject connectome similarity for Rest1, MovieDM, and MovieTP. We show that stability and similarity were correlated, but that these measures were not related to age. A principal component analysis of these measures yielded two components that we used to test for brain-behavior correlations with IQ, general psychopathology, and social skills measures (n=119). The first component was significantly correlated with the social skills measure (r=-0.26, p=0.005). Post hoc correlations showed that the social skills measure correlated with both cross-rest stability (r=-0.29, p=0.001) and with connectome similarity during MovieDM (r=-0.28, p=0.002). These findings suggest that the stability and similarity of the whole-brain connectome relate to overall brain development, and in particular, to those regions that support social skills. We infer that the development of the functional connectome simultaneously achieves patterns of FC that are distinct at the individual subject level, that are shared across individuals, and that are persistent across states and across runs--features which presumably combine to optimize neural processing during development. Future longitudinal work could reveal the developmental trajectories of stability and similarity of the connectome.\n\nHighlights- Identification algorithms yielded low accuracies in this developmental sample.\n- Individual differences in FC were not as persistent across states or movies.\n- Connectome within-subject stability and between-subject similarity were interrelated.\n- Stability during rest and similarity during a movie correlate with social skills scores.",

    "abstract": "Signals used in animal communication, especially those that are learned, are thought to be prone to rapid and/or regular evolution. It has been hypothesized that the evolution of song learning in birds has resulted in elevated diversification rates, as learned song may be subject to especially rapid evolution, and song is involved in mate choice. However, we know little about the evolutionary modes of learned song divergence over timescales relevant to speciation. Here we provide evidence that aspects of the territorial songs of Eastern Afromontane sky island sunbirds Cinnyris evolve in a punctuated fashion, with periods of stasis, on the order of hundreds of thousands of years or more, broken up by strong evolutionary pulses. Stasis in learned songs is inconsistent with learned traits being subject to constant or frequent change, as would be expected if selection does not constrain song phenotypes, or if novel phenotypes are frequently advantageous. Learned song may instead follow a process resembling peak shifts on adaptive landscapes. While much research has focused on the potential for rapid evolution in bird song, our results suggest that selection can tightly constrain the evolution of learned songs over fairly long timescales. More broadly, these results demonstrate that some aspects of highly variable, plastic traits can exhibit punctuated evolution, with stasis over fairly long time periods.",

Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 1000 associations for BMD.

Here, we focused on a single component of BMD, osteoblast-mediated bone formation in mice, and identified associations influencing osteoblast activity on mouse Chromosomes (Chrs) 1, 4, and 17. The locus on Chr. 4 was in an intergenic region between Wnt4 and Zbtb40, homologous to a locus for BMD in humans. We tested both Wnt4 and Zbtb40 for a role in osteoblast activity and BMD. Knockdown of Zbtb40, but not Wnt4, in osteoblasts drastically reduced mineralization. Additionally, loss-of-function mouse models for both genes exhibited reduced BMD. Our results highlight that investigating the genetic basis of in vitro osteoblast mineralization can be used to identify genes impacting bone formation and BMD.",

We aimed to identify the neural signatures of the preparatory processing of upcoming speech.

The phase responses to the attended speech at the delta band (1-4 Hz) were correlated with the comprehension performance of individual participants, with a latency of -200-0 ms before onset over the fronto-central and left-lateralized parietal regions. The phase responses to the attended speech at the alpha band also correlated with comprehension performance, but with a latency of 650-980 ms post-onset over fronto-central regions. Distinct neural signatures were found for the attentional modulation, taking the form of TRF-based amplitude responses at a latency of 240-320 ms post-onset over the left-lateralized fronto-central and occipital regions. Our findings reveal how the brain gets prepared to process an upcoming speech in a continuous, naturalistic speech context.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptome of nutrient sensing and the regulation of gut motility by nutrients in a stomachless fish with a short digestive tract; the ballan wrasse (Labrus berggylta) were investigated. Using an in vitro model, we differentiate how signals initiated by physical stretch and nutrients modulate the gut evacuation rate and motility patterns, and transcriptomic changes. Stretch on the intestine by inert cellulose initiated fast evacuation out of the anterior intestine compared to the digestible protein and lipid. Stretch on the intestine upregulated genes associated with increased muscle activity, whereas nutrients stimulated pathways related to ribosomal activity and the increase in the expression of several neuropeptides which are directly involved in gut motility regulation. Our findings show that physical pressure in the intestine initiate contractions propelling the matter towards the exit, whereas the sensing of nutrients modulates the motility to prolong the residence of digesta in the digestive tract for optimal digestion.\n\nSummary statementPressure by food speed up peristalsis in the intestine, but the intestines ability to sense nutrients slow down peristalsis for better digestion. This is partly controlled by genetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the third-leading cause of cancer mortality in the US and is highly resistant to classical, targeted, and immune therapies. We show that human PDA cells are dependent on the provision of exogenous cystine to avert a catastrophic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, left unchecked, leads to ferroptotic cell death, both in vitro and in vivo. Using a dual-recombinase genetically engineered model, we found that acute deletion of Slc7a11 led to tumor-selective ferroptosis, tumor stabilizations/regressions, and extended overall survival. The mechanism of ferroptosis induction in PDA cells required the concerted depletion of both glutathione and coenzyme A, highlighting a novel branch of ferroptosis-relevant metabolism. Finally, we found that cystine depletion in vivo using the pre-IND agent cyst(e)inase phenocopied Slc7a11 deletion, inducing tumor-selective ferroptosis and disease stabilizations/regressions in the well-validated KPC model of PDA.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryGenetic and pharmacological targeting of cystine import induces pancreatic cancer-selective ferroptosis in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Several events during normal development of the mammalian neocortex depend on N-cadherin, including the radial migration of immature projection neurons into the cortical plate. Remarkably, radial migration requires the N-cadherin extracellular domain but not N-cadherin-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion, suggesting that other N-cadherin-binding proteins may be involved. We used proximity ligation and affinity purification proteomics to identify N-cadherin-binding proteins. Both screens detected MycBP2 and SPRY-domain protein Fbxo45, two components of an intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase. Fbxo45 appears to be secreted by a non-classical mechanism, not involving a signal peptide and not requiring endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport. Fbxo45 binding requires N-cadherin SPRY motifs that are not involved in cell-cell adhesion. SPRY-mutant N-cadherin does not support radial migration in vivo. Radial migration was similarly inhibited when Fbxo45 expression was suppressed. The results suggest that projection neuron migration requires both Fbxo45 and binding of Fbxo45 or another protein to SPRY motifs in the extracellular domain of N-cadherin.",

Using N. brasiliensis infection we confirm previous observations that Il17a-KO mice exhibit an impaired type-2 immune response. Neutrophil depletion and reconstitution studies demonstrated that neutrophils contribute to the subsequent eosinophilia but are not responsible for the ability of IL-17A to promote type-2 cytokine responses. Transcriptional profiling of the lung on day 2 of N. brasiliensis infection revealed an increased Ifn{gamma} signature in the Il17a-KO mice confirmed by enhanced IFN{gamma} protein production. Depletion of early IFN{gamma} rescued type-2 immune responses in the Il17a-KO mice demonstrating that IL-17A-mediated suppression of IFN{gamma} promotes type-2 immunity. Notably, when IL-17A was blocked later in infection, the type-2 response increased. IL-17A regulation of type-2 immunity was lung-specific and infection with Trichuris muris, revealed that IL-17A promotes a type-2 immune response in the lung even when a parasite lifecycle is restricted to the intestine. Together our data reveal IL-17A as a major regulator of pulmonary type-2 immunity which supports the development of a protective type-2 immune response but subsequently limits the magnitude of that response.",

    "abstract": "Automated segmentation techniques are essential to tracing the entirety of ultrastructures in large three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-EM) images of the brain tissue. Current automated techniques use deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and rely on high-contrast cellular membranes to trace a small number of neuronal processes in very high-resolution EM datasets. We developed DeepACSON to segment large field-of-view, low-resolution 3D-EM datasets of white matter where tens of thousands of myelinated axons traverse the tissue. DeepACSON performs DCNN-based semantic segmentation and shape decomposition-based instance segmentation. With its top-down design, DeepACSON manages to account for severe membrane discontinuities inescapable with the low-resolution imaging. In particular, the instance segmentation of DeepACSON uses the tubularity of myelinated axons, decomposing an under-segmented myelinated axon into its constituent axons. We applied DeepACSON to ten serial block-face scanning electron microscopy datasets of rats after sham-operation or traumatic brain injury, segmenting hundreds of thousands of long-span myelinated axons, thousands of cell nuclei, and millions of mitochondria with excellent evaluation scores. DeepACSON quantified the morphology and spatial aspects of white matter ultrastructures, capturing nanoscopic morphological alterations five months after the injury.",

    "abstract": "Spatial learning is impaired in preclinical Alzheimers disease (AD). We reported similar impairments in 3xTg-AD mice learning a spatial reorientation task. Memory reactivation during sleep is critical for learning related plasticity, and memory consolidation is correlated with hippocampal sharp wave ripple (SWR) density, cortical delta waves (DWs), and their temporal coupling - postulated as a physiological substrate of memory consolidation. Finally, hippocampal-cortical dyscoordination is prevalent in individuals with AD. Thus, we hypothesized impaired memory consolidation mechanisms in hippocampal-cortical networks could account for spatial memory deficits. We assessed sleep architecture, SWR/DW dynamics and memory reactivation in a mouse model of tauopathy and amyloidosis implanted with a recording array targeting isocortex and hippocampus. Mice underwent daily recording sessions of rest-task-rest while learning the spatial reorientation task. We assessed memory reactivation by matching activity patterns from the approach to the unmarked reward zone to patterns during slow wave sleep (SWS). AD mice had more SWS, but reduced SWR density. The increased SWS compensated for reduced SWR density so there was no reduction in SWR number. Conversely, DW density was not reduced so the number of DWs was increased. In control mice hippocampal SWR-cortical DW coupling was strengthened in post-task-sleep and was correlated with performance on the spatial reorientation task the following day. However, in AD mice SWR-DW coupling was reduced and not correlated with behavior, suggesting behavioral decoupling. Thus, reduced SWR-DW coupling may cause impaired learning in AD and may serve as a biomarker for early AD related changes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the relationship between network dynamics and cognition early in Alzheimers disease progression is critical for identifying therapeutic targets for earlier treatment. We assessed hippocampal-cortical interactions during sleep in AD mice as a potential cause of early spatial learning and memory deficits. We identified compensatory sleep changes in AD mice, that ameliorated some brain dysfunction. Despite the compensatory changes, impaired spatial navigation and impaired hippocampal-cortical (sharp wave ripple-delta wave) interactions were apparent in AD mice. In control but not AD mice hippocampal-cortical interactions were correlated with performance on the spatial task, the following day, suggesting a potential mechanism of impaired consolidation in AD mice. Thus, changes in hippocampal-cortical brain dynamics during sleep may underlie early memory deficits in AD.",

    "abstract": "The disordered network of blood vessels that arises from tumour angiogenesis results in variations in the delivery of oxygen into the tumour tissue. This brings about regions of chronic hypoxia (i.e. sustained low oxygen levels) and regions with alternating phases of low and relatively higher oxygen levels within vascularised tumours, and makes it necessary for cancer cells to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. We use a phenotype-structured model to dissect the evolutionary dynamics of cell populations exposed to fluctuating oxygen levels. In this model, the phenotypic state of every cell is described by a continuous variable that provides a simple representation of its metabolic phenotype, ranging from fully oxidative to fully glycolytic, and cells are grouped into two competing populations that undergo heritable, spontaneous phenotypic variations at different rates. Model simulations indicate that, depending on the rate at which oxygen is consumed by the cells, nonlinear dynamic interactions between cells and oxygen can stimulate chronic hypoxia and cycling hypoxia. Moreover, the model supports the idea that under chronic-hypoxic conditions lower rates of phenotypic variation lead to a competitive advantage, whereas higher rates of phenotypic variation can confer a competitive advantage under cycling-hypoxic conditions. In the latter case, the numerical results obtained show that bet-hedging evolutionary strategies, whereby cells switch between oxidative and glycolytic phenotypes, can spontaneously emerge. We explain how these results can shed light on the evolutionary process that may underpin the emergence of phenotypic heterogeneity in vascularised tumours.",

    "abstract": "Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is considered a powerful tool to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are useful to characterize closely related genomes of plant species and plant pathogens. We applied GBS to determine genome-wide variations in a panel of 187 isolates of three closely related Alternaria spp. that cause diseases on tomato and potato in North Carolina (NC) and Wisconsin (WI). To compare genetic variations, reads were mapped to both A. alternata and A. solani draft reference genomes and detected dramatic differences in SNPs among them. Comparison of A. linariae and A. solani populations by principal component analysis revealed the first (83.8% of variation) and second (8.0% of variation) components contained A. linariae from tomato in NC and A. solani from potato in WI, respectively, providing evidence of population structure. Genetic differentiation (Hedricks GST) in A. linariae populations from Haywood, Macon, and Madison counties in NC were little or no differentiated (GST 0.0 - 0.2). However, A. linariae population from Swain county appeared to be highly differentiated (GST > 0.8). To measure the strength of the linkage disequilibrium (LD), we also calculated the allelic association between pairs of loci. Lewontins D (measures the fraction of allelic variations) and physical distances provided evidence of linkage throughout the entire genome, consistent with the hypothesis of non-random association of alleles among loci. Our findings provide new insights into the understanding of clonal populations on a genome-wide scale and microevolutionary factors that might play an important role in population structure. Although we found limited genetic diversity, the three Alternaria spp. studied here are genetically distinct and each species is preferentially associated with one host.",
