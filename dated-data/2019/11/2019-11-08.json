    "abstract": "Mathematical models can enable a predictive understanding of mechanism in cell biology by quantitatively describing complex networks of interactions, but such models are often poorly constrained by available data. Owing to its relative biochemical simplicity, the core circadian oscillator in Synechococcus elongatus has become a prototypical system for studying how collective dynamics emerge from molecular interactions. The oscillator consists of only three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, and near-24-h cycles of KaiC phosphorylation can be reconstituted in vitro. Here, we formulate a molecularly-detailed but mechanistically agnostic model of the KaiA-KaiC subsystem and fit it directly to experimental data within a Bayesian parameter estimation framework. Analysis of the fits consistently reveals an ultrasensitive response for KaiC phosphorylation as a function of KaiA concentration, which we confirm experimentally. This ultrasensitivity primarily results from the differential affinity of KaiA for competing nucleotide-bound states of KaiC. We argue that the ultrasensitive stimulus-response relation is critical to metabolic compensation by suppressing premature phosphorylation at nighttime.\n\nSynopsisThis study takes a data-driven kinetic modeling approach to characterizing the interaction between KaiA and KaiC in the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator and understanding how the oscillator responds to changes in cellular metabolic conditions.

    "abstract": "Symbiotic corals have evolved as a highly optimised photon augmentation system leading to space-efficient microalgal growth and photosynthetic quantum efficiencies that approach theoretical limits1-3. Corals are characterized by an elastic animal tissue hosting microalgae and a light scattering calcium carbonate skeleton that maximizes light delivery towards otherwise shaded algal-containing tissues4,5. Rapid light attenuation due to algal self-shading is a key limiting factor for the upscaling of microalgal cultivation6,7. Coral-inspired light management systems could overcome this limitation and facilitate scalable bioenergy and bioproduct generation8,9. Here, we developed 3D printed bionic corals capable of growing various types of microalgae with cell densities approaching 109 cells mL-1, up to 100 times greater than in liquid culture. The hybrid photosynthetic biomaterials are produced with a new 3D bioprinting platform which mimics morphological features of living coral tissue and the underlying skeleton with micron resolution, including their optical and mechanical properties. The programmable synthetic microenvironment thus allows for replicating both structural and functional traits of the coral-algal symbiosis. Our work defines a new class of bionic materials capable of interacting with living organisms, that can be exploited for the design of next generation photobioreactors7 and disruptive approaches for coral reef conservation10.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of continuous chaotic printing, i.e., the use of chaotic flows for deterministic and continuous fabrication of fibers with internal multilayered micro-or nanostructures. Two free-flowing materials are coextruded through a printhead containing a miniaturized Kenics static mixer (KSM) composed of multiple helicoidal elements. This produces a fiber with a well-defined internal multilayer microarchitecture at high speeds (>1.0 m min-1). The number of mixing elements and the printhead diameter determine the number and thickness of the internal lamellae, which are generated according to successive bifurcations that yield a vast amount of inter-material surface area (~102 cm2 cm3) and high resolution features (~10 m). In an exciting further development, we demonstrate a scale-down of the microstructure by 3 orders of magnitude, to the nanoscale level (~10 nm), by feeding the output of a continuous chaotic 3D printhead into an electrospinner. Comparison of experimental and computational results demonstrates the robust and predictable output and performance of continuous chaotic 3D printing. The simplicity and high resolution of continuous chaotic printing strongly supports its potential use in novel applications, including--but not limited to--bioprinting of multi-scale tissue-like structures, modeling of bacterial communities, and fabrication of smart multi-material and multilayered constructs.",

    "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning has emerged as a powerful, high throughput approach to determine the growth effect of thousands of alleles at once in bulk competition. However, to date only the growth effect of mutant alleles in isolation has been determined. Building off previous work, we have created a library of all possible single point mutations in ubiquitin and determined the growth effect of mutants overexpressed in the presence of a wild type allele. Using this scan, we explained over half of the previously missing mutants in the single allele scan by showing that they exhibit deleterious effects when co-expressed with wild type ubiquitin. Additionally, unlike the single allele growth effect, these overexpression growth effects were distributed across the entire protein. This overexpression scan methodology can identify likely dominant mutant effects in any essential gene and is highly complementary with traditional deep mutational scanning approaches.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use various kinds of toxins to either inhibit the growth of co-habiting bacteria or when needed control their own growth. Here we report that Burkholderia and certain other bacteria have altered the potential defensive function of Tox-REase-5 domain containing toxins into offensive function. The Burkholderia gladioli strain NGJ1 encodes such toxins as type VI secretion system (T6SS) effectors (Tse) and potentially deploys them to kill co-habiting rice endophytic bacteria. Notably, the immunity (Tsi) proteins associated with Tse effectors demonstrate functional similarity with the antitoxin of type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. Genome analysis of diverse bacteria revealed that various Tse orthologs are either encoded as TA or T6SS effectors. In addition, potential evolutionary events associated with conversion of TA into T6SS effectors have been delineated. Our results indicate that the transposition of IS3 elements has led to the operonic fusion of certain T6SS related genes with TA genes resulting in their conversion into T6SS effectors. Such a genetic change has enabled bacteria to utilize novel toxins to precisely target co-habiting bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The superior colliculus (SC) is arguably the most important visual structure in the mouse brain and is well-known for its involvement in innate responses to visual threats and prey items. In other species, the SC plays a central role in voluntary as well as innate visual functions, including crucial contributions to selective attention and perceptual decision-making. In the mouse, the possible role of the SC in voluntary visual choice behaviors has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse SC plays a causal role in visual perceptual decision-making by transiently inhibiting SC activity during an orientation-change detection task. First, unilateral SC inhibition induced spatially specific deficits in detection. Hit rates were reduced and reaction times increased for orientation changes in the contralateral but not ipsilateral visual field. Second, the deficits caused by SC inhibition were specific to a temporal epoch coincident with early visual burst responses in the SC. Inhibiting SC during this 100-ms period caused a contralateral detection deficit, whereas inhibition immediately before or after did not. Third, SC inhibition reduced visual detection sensitivity. Psychometric analysis revealed that inhibiting SC visual activity significantly increased detection thresholds for contralateral orientation changes. In addition, effects on detection thresholds and lapse rates caused by SC inhibition were larger in the presence of a competing visual stimulus, indicating a role for the mouse SC in visual target selection. Together, our results demonstrate that the mouse SC plays a crucial role in voluntary visual choice behaviors.\n\nSignificance statementThe mouse superior colliculus has become a popular model for studying the circuit organization and development of the visual system. Although the SC is a fundamental component of the visual pathways in mice, its role in visual perceptual decision-making is not clear. By investigating how temporally precise SC inhibition influenced behavioral performance during a visually guided orientation change detection task, we identified a 100-ms temporal epoch of SC visual activity that is crucial for the ability of mice to detect behaviorally relevant visual changes. In addition, we found that SC inhibition also caused deficits in visual target selection. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of the SC for visual perceptual choice behavior in the mouse.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsARID1A is postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene owing to loss-of-function mutations in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). However, its role in pancreatic pathogenesis is not clear despite recent studies using genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. We aimed at further understanding of its direct functional role in PDAC, using a combination of GEM model, PDAC cell lines.\n\nMethodsPancreas-specific mutant Arid1a-driven GEM model (Ptf1a-Cre;KrasG12D;Arid1af/f or \"KAC\") was generated by crossing Ptf1a-Cre;KrasG12D (\"KC\") mice with Arid1af/f mice and characterized histologically with timed necropsies. Arid1a was also deleted using CRISPR-Cas9 system in established PDAC cell lines to study the immediate effects of Arid1a loss in isogenic models. Cells lines with or without Arid1a expression were developed from respective autochthonous PDAC GEM models, compared functionally using various culture assays, and subjected to RNA-sequencing for comparative gene expression analysis. DNA damage repair was analyzed in cultured cells using immunofluorescence and COMET assay.\n\nResultsArid1a is critical for early progression of mutant Kras-driven pre-malignant lesions into PDAC, as evident by lower Ki-67 and higher apoptosis staining in \"KAC\" as compared to \"KC\" mice. Enforced deletion of Arid1a in established PDAC cell lines caused suppression of cellular growth and migration, accompanied by compromised DNA damage repair. Despite early development of relatively indolent cystic precursor lesions called intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), a subset of \"KAC\" mice developed aggressive PDAC in later ages. PDAC cells obtained from older autochthonous \"KAC\" mice revealed epigenetic changes underlying the various compensatory mechanisms to overcome the growth suppressive effects of Arid1a loss.\n\nConclusionsArid1a is an essential survival gene whose loss impairs cellular growth, and thus, its expression is critical during early stages of pancreatic tumorigenesis in mouse models.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is hypothesized to be an important evolutionary mechanism that can facilitate adaptation and speciation. Genomes that exist in states of both diploidy and residual tetraploidy are of particular interest, as mechanisms that maintain the ploidy mosaic after WGD may provide important insights into evolutionary processes. The Salmonidae family exhibits residual tetraploidy, and this, combined with the evolutionary diversity formed after an ancestral autotetraploidization event, makes this group a useful study system. In this study, we generate a novel linkage map for cisco (Coregonus artedi), an economically and culturally important fish in North America and a member of the subfamily Coregoninae, which previously lacked a high-density haploid linkage map. We also conduct comparative genomic analyses to refine our understanding of chromosomal fusion/fission history across salmonids. To facilitate this comparative approach, we use the naming strategy of protokaryotype identifiers (PKs) to associate duplicated chromosomes to their putative ancestral state. The female linkage map for cisco contains 20,292 loci, 3,225 of which are likely within residually tetraploid regions. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that patterns of residual tetrasomy are generally conserved across species, although interspecific variation persists. To determine the broad-scale retention of residual tetrasomy across the salmonids, we analyze sequence similarity of currently available genomes and find evidence of residual tetrasomy in seven of the eight chromosomes that have been previously hypothesized to show this pattern. This interspecific variation in extent of rediploidization may have important implications for understanding salmonid evolutionary histories and informing future conservation efforts.",

Understanding how it regulates its oxygen supply is therefore key for designing interventions to preserve its function. However, studies of neurovascular function in the hippocampus in vivo have been limited by its relative inaccessibility. Here we compared hippocampal and visual cortical neurovascular function in awake mice, using two photon imaging of individual neurons and vessels and measures of regional blood flow and haemoglobin oxygenation. We show that blood flow, blood oxygenation and neurovascular coupling were decreased in the hippocampus compared to neocortex, because of differences in both the vascular network and pericyte and endothelial cell function. Modelling oxygen diffusion indicates that these features of the hippocampal vasculature could explain its sensitivity to damage during neurological conditions, including Alzheimers disease, where the brains energy supply is decreased.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of coral reef sampling and monitoring are highly variable, with numbers of units and sampling effort varying from one study to another. Numerous works have been carried out to determine an appropriate effect size through statistical power, however, always from a univariate perspective. In this work, we used the pseudo multivariate dissimilarity-based standard error (MultSE) approach to assess the precision of sampling scleractinian coral assemblages in reefs of Venezuela between 2017 and 2018 when using different combinations of number of transects, quadrats and points. For this, the MultSE of 36 sites previously sampled was estimated, using four 30m-transects with 15 photo-quadrats each and 25 random points per quadrat. We obtained that the MultSE was highly variable between sites and is not correlated with the univariate standard error nor with the richness of species. Then, a subset of sites was re-annotated using 100 uniformly distributed points, which allowed the simulation of different numbers of transects per site, quadrats per transect and points per quadrat using resampling techniques. The magnitude of the MultSE stabilized by adding more transects, however, adding more quadrats or points does not improve the estimate. For this case study, the error was reduced by half when using 10 transects, 10 quadrats per transect and 25 points per quadrat. We recommend the use of MultSE in reef monitoring programs, in particular when conducting pilot surveys to optimize the estimation of the community structure.",

    "abstract": "Deforestation is a major cause of biodiversity loss in Asia. Using fine-resolution satellite imagery we assessed the change in forest cover of a state-managed Reserved Forest located in Indias Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hot-spot. Thirty-two square kilometers of forest cover was lost from 2013 and 2017 with a 5% decline in total forest area over four years. Hornbills are a key functionally important species found in the area. We therefore assessed the habitat around 29 hornbill nest trees in this Reserved Forest and estimated that there was a loss of 35% of forest cover from 2011 to 2019. We identify illegal logging (despite a ban by the Supreme Court of India) as the main driver that is depleting forest cover within this important area. Our results highlight the ongoing threats to biologically-rich forests and the need for urgent measures to halt this loss. We suggest that this study has practical implications for the governance of non-PA state-managed forests in Arunachal Pradesh. The ongoing deforestation appears to be due to organized crime, institutional inadequacy from a combination of limited resources, bureaucratic apathy, and/or ambiguity in use and ownership of forest land compared to other community forests which appear to have robust governance systems.",

    "abstract": "A.The concept of the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) has been fundamental to the development of evolutionary game theory. It represents an equilibrial evolutionary state in which no rare invader can grow in population size. With additional work, the ESS concept has been formalized and united with other stability concepts such as convergent stability, neighborhood invasion stability, and mutual invisibility. Other work on evolutionary models, however, shows the possibility of unstable and/or non-equilibrial dynamics such as limit cycles and evolutionary suicide. Such \"pathologies\" remain outside of a well-defined context, especially the currently defined stability concepts of evolutionary games. Ripa et al. (2009) offer a possible reconciliation between work on non-equilibrial dynamics and the ESS concept. They noticed that the systems they analyzed show non-equilibrial dynamics when under-saturated and \"far\" from the ESS and that getting \"closer\" to the ESS through the addition of more species stabilized their systems. To that end, we analyzed three models of evolution, two predator-prey models and one competition model of evolutionary suicide, to see how the degree of saturation affects the stability of the system. In the predator-prey models, stability is linked to the degree of saturation. Specifically, a fully saturated community will only show stable dynamics, and unstable dynamics occur only when the community is under-saturated. With the competition model, we demonstrate it to be permanently under-saturated, likely showing such extreme dynamics for this reason. Though not a general proof, our analysis of the models provide evidence of the link between community saturation and evolutionary dynamics. Our results offer a possible placement of these evolutionary \"pathologies\" into a wider framework. In addition, the results concur with previous results showing greater evolutionary response to less biodiversity and clarifies the effect of extrinsic vs. intrinsic non-equilibrial evolutionary dynamics on a community.",

    "abstract": "Particle image velocimetry and video analysis were employed to discern and describe the mechanism used by the stingray Potamotrygon motoro to bury into the substrate. P. motoro repeatedly and rapidly pumped the body up and down while folding the posterior portion of the pectoral fins up and over, drawing water in and suspending sediment beneath the pectoral disc. As the fins folded up and over, vortices of fluidized sediment travelled along the ventral surface of the fins toward the fin tips, and were then directed onto the dorsal surface of the fins and towards the dorsal midline of the fish, where they dissipated and the sediment settled over the dorsal surface of the ray. As displacement and speed of the body pumping and finbeat motions increased, the speed of the sediment translating across the dorsal surface increased, and accordingly, sediment coverage of the dorsal surface increased. Mean sediment coverage was 82.5% {+/-} 3.0 S.E.M, and appeared to be selectively controlled, whereby the pectoral fins tended to bury more than the body, head and tail, and the body more than the head and the tail. In the most vigorous burying events, vortices of sediment shed from each fin collided at the midline and annihilated, reorienting the sediment flow and sending jets of sediment towards the head and the tail, covering these locations with sediment. Hence, this study demonstrates that the mechanism of burying employed by P. motoro permits effective control of sediment vortices and flows to modulate the extent of burying.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to integrate biomimetic robots into small groups of zebrafish and to modulate their collective behaviours. A possible approach is to have the robots behave like sheepdogs. In this case, the robots would behave like a different species than the fish and would present different relevant behaviours. In this study, we explore different strategies that use biomimetic zebrafish behaviours. In past work, we have shown that robots biomimicking zebrafish can be socially integrated into zebrafish groups. We have also shown that a fish-like robot can modulate the rotation choice of zebrafish groups in a circular set-up. Here, we further study the modulation capabilities of such robots in a more complex set-up. To do this, we exploit zebrafish social behaviours we identified in previous studies. We first modulate collective departure by replicating the leadership mechanisms with the robot in a set-up composed of two rooms connected by a corridor. Then, we test different behavioural strategies to drive the fish groups towards a predefined target room. To drive the biohybrid groups towards a predefined choice, they have to adopt some specific fish-like behaviours. The first strategy is based on a single robot using the initiation behaviour. In this case, the robot keeps trying to initiate a group transition towards the target room. The second strategy is based on two robots, one initiating and one staying in the target room as a social attractant. The third strategy is based on a single robot behaving like a zebrafish but staying in the target room as a social attractant. The fourth strategy uses two robots behaving like zebrafish but staying in the target room. We conclude that robots can modulate zebrafish group behaviour by adopting strategies based on existing fish behaviours. Under these conditions, robots enable the testing of hypotheses about the behaviours of fish.",

    "abstract": "Studying the evolutionary processes that shaped aging offers a path for understanding the causes of aging. The Antagonistic Pleiotropy theory for the evolution of aging proposes that the inverse correlation between natural selection strength and aging allows positive selection of gene variants with early-life beneficial contributions to fitness in spite of detrimental late-life consequences. However, mechanistic understanding of how this principle manifests in aging is still lacking. We previously identified antagonistic pleiotropy in the function of the Caenorhabditis elegans JNK homolog KGB-1, which provided stress protection in developing larvae, but sensitized adults to stress and shortened their lifespan. To a large extent, KGB-1s contributions depended on age-dependent and opposing regulation of the stress transcription factor DAF-16, but the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. Here we describe a role for the microRNA mir-71 in mediating effects of KGB-1 on DAF-16 and on downstream phenotypes. Fluorescent imaging along with genetic and survival analyses revealed age-dependent regulation of mir-71 expression by KGB-1 - upregulation in larvae, but downregulation in adults, and showed that mir-71 was required both for late-life effects of KGB-1 (infection sensitivity and shortened lifespan), as well as for early life resistance to cadmium. While mir-71 disruption did not compromise development under protein folding stress (known to depend on KGB-1), disruption of the argonaute gene alg-1, a central component of the microRNA machinery, did. These results suggest that microRNAs play a role in mediating age-dependent antagonistic contributions of KGB-1 to survival, with mir-71 playing a central role and additional microRNAs contributing redundantly.",

    "abstract": "During clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), over 50 different proteins assemble on the plasma membrane to reshape it into a cargo-laden vesicle. It has long been assumed that cargo triggers local CME site assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the discovery that cortical actin patches clustered near exocytic sites are CME sites. Quantitative imaging data reported here lead to a radically different view of which CME steps are regulated and which steps are deterministic. We quantitatively and spatially describe progression through the CME pathway and pinpoint a cargo-sensitive regulatory transition point that governs progression from the initiation phase of CME to the internalization phase. Thus, site maturation, rather than site initiation, accounts for the previously observed polarized distribution of actin patches in this organism. While previous studies suggested that cargo ensures its own internalization by regulating either CME initiation rates or frequency of abortive events, our data instead identify maturation through a checkpoint in the pathway as the cargo-sensitive step.\n\nSummaryPedersen, Hassinger, et al. investigate steps of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway that are subject to regulation. They report position-dependent differences in endocytic site maturation rates in polarized cells and suggest that cargo controls endocytic internalization through tuning site maturation rather than site initiation.",

Mediation analysis experiences a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with MR: multivariable Mendelian randomisation (MVMR) and two-step Mendelian randomisation. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although Mendelian randomisation relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our examples demonstrate that it is unlikely to be affected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome, reverse causality and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both MVMR and two-step MR can be implemented in both individual-level MR and summary data MR, and can improve causal inference in mediation analysis.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila shaggy gene (sgg, GSK-3) encodes multiple protein isoforms with serine/threonine kinase activity and is a key player in diverse developmental signalling pathways. Currently it is unclear whether different Sgg proteoforms are similarly involved in signalling or if different proteoforms have distinct functions. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to tag eight different Sgg proteoform classes and determined their localization during embryonic development. We performed proteomic analysis of the two major proteoform classes and generated mutant lines for both of these for transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis. We uncovered distinct tissue-specific localization patterns for all of the tagged proteoforms we examined, most of which have not previously been characterised directly at the protein level, including one proteoform initiating with a non-standard codon. Collectively this suggests complex developmentally regulated splicing of the sgg primary transcript. Further, affinity purification followed by mass spectrometric analyses indicate a different repertoire of interacting proteins for the two major proteoform classes we examined, one with ubiquitous expression (Sgg-PB) and one with nervous system specific expression (Sgg-PA). Specific mutation of these proteoforms shows that Sgg-PB performs the well characterised maternal and zygotic segmentations functions of the sgg locus, while Sgg-PA mutants show adult lifespan and locomotor defects consistent with its nervous system localisation. Our findings provide new insights into the role of GSK-3 proteoforms and intriguing links with the GSK-3 and GSK-3{beta} encoded by independent vertebrate genes. Our analysis suggests that different protein isoforms generated by alternative splicing perform distinct functions.",

We applied this framework to conduct a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) on 7,805 ASD proband-parent trios, and replicated our findings using 35,740 independent samples. We identified 31 associations at the transcriptome-wide significance level. In particular, we identified POU3F2 (p=2.1e-7), a transcription factor (TF) mainly expressed in developmental brain. TF targets regulated by POU3F2 showed a 2.1-fold enrichment for known ASD genes (p=4.6e-5) and a 2.7-fold enrichment for loss-of-function de novo mutations in ASD probands (p=7.1e-5). These results provide a clear example of the connection between ASD genes affected by very rare mutations and an unlinked key regulator affected by common genetic variations.",

    "abstract": "The lysosome-like vacuolar compartment (VAC) is a major site of proteolysis in the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Previous studies have shown that genetic ablation of a VAC-residing cysteine protease, cathepsin protease L (CPL), resulted in accumulation of undigested protein in the VAC and loss of parasite viability during the chronic stage of infection. However, since the maturation of another VAC localizing protease, cathepsin protease B (CPB), is dependent on CPL, it remained unknown whether these defects result directly from ablation of CPL or indirectly from a lack of CPB maturation. Likewise, although a previously described cathepsin D-like aspartyl protease 1 (ASP1) could also play a role in proteolysis, its definitive residence and function in the Toxoplasma endolysosomal system was not well defined. Here we demonstrate that CPB is not necessary for protein turnover in the VAC and that CPB deficient parasites have normal growth and viability in both the acute and chronic stages of infection. We also show that ASP1 depends on CPL for correct maturation and it resides in the T. gondii VAC where, similar to CPB, it plays a dispensable role in protein digestion. Taken together with previous work, our findings suggest that CPL is the dominant protease in a hierarchy of proteolytic enzymes within the VAC. This unusual lack of redundancy for CPL in T. gondii makes it a single exploitable target for disrupting chronic toxoplasmosis.",

Yet how exactly rules shape actions towards specific sensory and/or motor requirements remains unclear. One possibility is that rules become integrated with sensory/response features in a non-linear, conjunctive manner (e.g., event files; Hommel, 1998) to drive rule-guided action selection. To dynamically track such conjunctive representations during action selection, we applied a time-resolved representational similarity analysis to the spectral-temporal profiles of the EEG signal, while participants selected actions based on varying rules. Across two experiments, we found that action selection engages conjunctive representations binding action rules to specific sensory/motor settings throughout the entire selection period. The strength of conjunctions was the most important predictor of trial-by-trial variability in response times (RTs) and was closely, and selectively, related to an important behavioral indicator of event files--the partial-overlap priming pattern. Thus, conjunctive representations were functionally dissociated from their constituent action features and play a critical role during flexible selection of action.",

    "abstract": "While polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been shown to identify a small number of individuals with increased clinical risk for several common diseases, non-genetic factors that change during a lifetime, such as lifestyle, employment, diet, and pollution, have a larger role in clinical prediction. We analyzed data from 459,613 participants of the UK Biobank to investigate the independent and combined roles of demographics (e.g., sex and age), 96 environmental exposures, and common genetic variants in atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 2 diabetes. We develop an additive modelling approach to estimate and validate a poly-exposure score (PXS) that goes beyond consideration of a handful of factors such as smoking and pollution. PXS is able to identify groups with high prevalence of the four common disease comparable to, if not better, than the PRS. Type 2 diabetes has the largest discrepancy in PXS and PRS performance, defined as the maximum area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) (PXS AUC of 0.828 [0.821-0.836], PRS AUC of 0.711 [0.702-0.720]). Most importantly, we show that PXS identifies individuals that have low genetic risk but high overall risk for disease. While PRS is useful for screening genetically exceptional individuals in a time-invariant way, broader consideration of multiple non-genetic and modifiable factors is required to fully translate risk scores to the bedside for precision medicine.

    "abstract": "The signs and symptoms of infectious disease are similar in presentation, such as fever and fatigue, but differ in magnitude, duration, and sequence. Although observable responses of dysfunction are well characterized, the integrative system mechanisms driving such trajectories are poorly known, even during normative circumstances. Here, molecular pathways are presented that enable predictive modeling of autonomic dysfunction due to infectious agents, and that illustrate a coordinating integration of body system dynamics. To arrive at this result, a molecular model is presented which shows, for the first time, that the hormone cortisol (CORT) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) have approximately equivalent chemical affinity, as indicated by the positioning of functional groups in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicity, with the ligand binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). A mathematical model is developed to predict that the signs and symptoms of illnesses are associated with the competitive inhibition at the GR of CORT and PGE2 within the hypothalamus that prevents normal gene expression during DNA transcription. To validate the pathways and model, a case study is presented to analyze the cause and presentation of fever and fatigue over multiple days due to the injection of a pneumococcal vaccine as influenced by physical activity. The research provides quantitative understanding of the root causes of signs and symptoms of infectious disease, which for example can offer a quantitative explanation of common symptomatic concerns of illness, such as fever, and can result in optimal drug treatment plans to minimize the effects of ailments.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/835546v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2832c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11bebbeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@121f1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b84fb5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Resting-state connectivity measures the temporal coherence of the spontaneous neural activity of spatially distinct regions, and is commonly measured using BOLD-fMRI. The BOLD response follows neuronal activity, when changes in the relative concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin cause fluctuations in the MRI T2* signal. Since the BOLD signal detects changes in relative concentrations of oxy/deoxy-haemoglobin, individual differences in haemoglobin levels may influence the BOLD signal-to-noise ratio in a manner independent of the degree of neural activity. In this study, we examined whether group differences in haemoglobin may confound measures of functional connectivity. We investigated whether relationships between measures of functional connectivity and cognitive performance could be influenced by individual variability in haemoglobin. Finally, we mapped the neuroanatomical distribution of the influence of haemoglobin on functional connectivity to determine where group differences in functional connectivity are manifest.\n\nIn a cohort of 518 healthy elderly subjects (259 men) each sex group was median split into two groups with high and low haemoglobin concentration. Significant differences were obtained in functional connectivity between the high and low haemoglobin groups for both men and women (Cohens d 0.17 and 0.03 for men and women respectively). The haemoglobin connectome in males showed a widespread systematic increase in functional connectivity correlational scores, whilst the female connectome showed predominantly parietal and subcortical increases and temporo-parietal decreases. Despite the haemoglobin groups having no differences in cognitive measures, significant differences in the linear relationships between cognitive performance and functional connectivity were obtained for all 5 cognitive tests in males, and 4 out of 5 tests in females.\n\nOur findings confirm that individual variability in haemoglobin levels that give rise to group differences are an important confounding variable in BOLD-fMRI-based studies of functional connectivity. Controlling for haemoglobin variability as a potentially confounding variable is crucial to ensure the reproducibility of human brain connectome studies, especially in studies that compare groups of individuals, compare sexes, or examine connectivity-cognition relationships.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIndividual differences in haemoglobin significantly impact measures of functional connectivity in the elderly.\nC_LIO_LISignificant differences in connectivity-cognition relationships are shown between groups separated by haemoglobin values without accompanying cognitive differences.\nC_LIO_LIThe influence of haemoglobin on functional connectivity differs between men and women.\nC_LI",
