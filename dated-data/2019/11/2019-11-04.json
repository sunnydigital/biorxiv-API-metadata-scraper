    "abstract": "Despite the continued analysis of HDAC inhibitor efficacy in clinical trials, the heterogeneous nature of the protein complexes they target limits our understanding of the beneficial and off-target effects associated with their application. Among the many HDAC protein complexes found within the cell, Sin3 complexes are conserved from yeast to humans and likely play important roles as regulators of transcriptional activity. The functional attributes of these protein complexes remain poorly characterized in humans. Contributing to the poor definition of Sin3 complex attributes in higher eukaryotes is the presence of two Sin3 scaffolding proteins, SIN3A and SIN3B. Here we show that paralog switching influences the interaction networks of the Sin3 complexes. While SIN3A and SIN3B do have unique interaction network components, we find that SIN3A and SIN3B interact with a common set of proteins. Additionally, our results suggest that SIN3A and SIN3B may possess the capacity to form hetero-oligomeric complexes. While one principal form of SIN3B exists in humans, the analysis of rare SIN3B proteoforms provides insight into the domain organization of SIN3B. Together, these findings shed light on the shared and divergent properties of human Sin3 proteins and highlight the heterogeneous nature of the complexes they organize.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe proto-oncogene (MPL) gen encodes the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO-R), a member of hematopoietic receptor superfamily. Thrombopoietin (TPO), the primary cytokine regulating self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, thrombopoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis. TPO binding to TPO-R induces activation of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). Activated JAK2 triggers the activation of downstream positive signaling pathways, leading to the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Mutations in MPL gene possibly will alter the normal regulatory mechanisms. Numerous MPL mutations have been observed in various hematopoietic cancers such as essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis and leukemias. In this study, we performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of the functional and structural impact of non-synonymous (nsSNP) that are deleterious to TPO-R structure and function.\\n\\nMethodologyThe data on human MPL gene was retrieved from dbSNP/NCBI. Nine prediction algorithms; SIFT, Polyphen, PROVEAN, SNAP2, Condel, PhD-SNP, I-Mutant, Mutpred. RaptorX and Chimera were used to analyzing the effect of nsSNPs on functions and structure of the TPO-R. STRING and KEGG database were used for TPO-R protein-protein interaction.\\n\\nResults and DiscussionAs per dbSNP database, the human MPL gene contained 445 missense mutations. A total 5 nsSNPs (D295G, R257C, Y252H, R537W and D128Y) were predicted to have the most damaging effects on TPO-R structure and function. STRING and KEGG revealed that MPL had strong interactions with proteins that involved in cell growth, apoptosis, signal transduction pathway, some cancers pathways such as colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreas cancers, and skin cancer. A literature search revealed that Y252H has contribute to the development of essential thrombocythemia.\\n\\nConclusionThese in silico predictions will provide useful information in selecting the target SNPs that are likely to have functional impact on the TPO-R and moreover could act as potential targets in genetic association studies.

    "abstract": "Interactions among microbial cells can generate new chemistries and functions, but exploitation requires establishment of communities that reliably recapitulate community-level phenotypes. Using mechanistic mathematical models, we show how simple manipulations to population structure can exogenously impose Darwinian-like properties on communities. Such scaffolding causes communities to participate directly in the process of evolution by natural selection and drives the evolution of cell-level interactions to the point where, despite underlying stochasticity, derived communities give rise to offspring communities that faithfully re-establish parental phenotype. The mechanism is akin to a developmental process (developmental correction) that arises from density dependent interactions among cells. Knowledge of ecological factors affecting evolution of developmental correction has implications for understanding the evolutionary origin of major egalitarian transitions, symbioses, and for top-down engineering of microbial communities.",

To demonstrate the utility of AtacWorks, we train a model on data from four human blood cell types and show that this model accurately denoises chromatin accessibility at base-pair resolution and identifies peaks from low-coverage bulk sequencing of unseen cell types and experimental conditions. We use the same framework to obtain high-quality results from as few as 50 aggregate single-cell ATAC-seq profiles, and also from data with a low signal-to-noise ratio. We further show that AtacWorks can be adapted for cross-modality prediction of transcription factor footprints and ChIP-seq peaks from low input ATAC-seq.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen, particularly noted for causing infections in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous studies have shown that the gene expression profile of P. aeruginosa appears to converge towards a common metabolic program as the organism adapts to the CF airway environment. However, at a systems level, we still have only a limited understanding of how these transcriptional changes impact on metabolic flux. To address this, we analysed the transcriptome, proteome and fluxome of P. aeruginosa grown on glycerol or acetate. These carbon sources were chosen because they are the primary breakdown products of airway surfactant, phosphatidylcholine, which is known to be a major carbon source for P. aeruginosa in the CF airways. We show that the flux of carbon through central metabolism is radically different on each carbon source. For example, the newly-recognised EDEMP cycle plays an important role in supplying NADPH during growth on glycerol. By contrast, the EDEMP cycle is attenuated during growth on acetate, and instead, NADPH is primarily supplied by the isocitrate dehydrogenase(s)-catalyzed reaction. Perhaps more importantly, our proteomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal a global remodelling of gene expression during growth on the different carbon sources, with unanticipated impacts on aerobic denitrification, electron transport chain architecture, and the redox economy of the cell. Collectively, these data highlight the remarkable metabolic plasticity of P. aeruginosa; a plasticity which allows the organism to seamlessly segue between different carbon sources, maximising the energetic yield from each.\\n\\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen, well-known for causing infections in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Although it is clear that P. aeruginosa is metabolically well-adapted to life in the CF lung, little is currently known about how the organism metabolises the nutrients available in the airways. In this work, we use a combination of gene expression and isotope tracer (\\\"fluxomic\\\") analyses to find out exactly where the input carbon goes during growth on two CF-relevant carbon sources, acetate and glycerol (derived from the breakdown of lung surfactant). We find that carbon is routed (\\\"fluxed\\\") through very different pathways during growth on these substrates, and that this is accompanied by an unexpected remodelling of the cells electron transfer pathways. Having access to this \\\"blueprint\\\" is important because the metabolism of P. aeruginosa is increasingly being recognised as a target for the development of much-needed antimicrobial agents.",

    "abstract": "The layer of peptidoglycan surrounding bacteria provides structural integrity for the bacterial cell wall. Many organisms, including human cells and diverse bacteria, detect peptidoglycan fragments that are released as bacteria grow. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains are the leading cause of human urinary tract infections (UTIs) and many patients experience recurrent infection after successful antibiotic treatment. The source of recurrent infections may be persistent bacterial reservoirs in vivo that are in a quiescent state and, thus, are not susceptible to antibiotics. Here, we show that multiple UPEC strains require a quorum to proliferate in vitro with glucose as the sole carbon source; at low density, the bacteria remain viable but enter a quiescent, non-proliferative state. Of all clinical UPEC isolates tested to date, 35% (51/145) enter this quiescent state, including archetypal strains CFT073 (from classic endemic lineage ST73) and JJ1886 (from recently emerged, multidrug-resistant pandemic lineage ST131). We further show that quorum-dependent UPEC quiescence is prevented and reversed by small molecules, called proliferants, that stimulate growth, such as L-lysine, L-methionine, and peptidoglycan (PG) stem peptides, including an isolated PG pentapeptide from Staphylococcus aureus. Together, our results indicate that (i) uptake of L-lysine and (ii) PG peptide sensing by UPEC modulate the quorum-regulated decision to proliferate and further demonstrate that PG fragments are important for intra- and interspecies signaling in pathogenic E. coli.",

Multiplications, mutations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SNCA gene, encoding alpha-synuclein protein (aSyn), either cause or increase risk for PD. Intracellular accumulations of aSyn are pathological hallmarks of PD. Taken together, reduction of aSyn production may provide a disease-modifying therapy for PD. We show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) reduce production of aSyn in rodent pre-formed fibril (PFF) models of PD. Reduced aSyn production leads to prevention and removal of established aSyn pathology and prevents dopaminergic cell dysfunction. In addition, we address the translational potential of the approach through characterization of human SNCA targeting ASOs that efficiently suppress the human SNCA transcript in vivo. We demonstrate broad activity and distribution of the human SNCA ASOs throughout the non-human primate brain and a corresponding decrease in aSyn cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels. Taken together, these data suggest that by inhibiting production of aSyn it may be possible to reverse established pathology and thus supports the development of SNCA ASOs as a potentially disease modifying therapy for PD and related synucleinopathies.\\n\\nSummaryAntisense oligonucleotides designed against SNCA, which are progressing to the clinic, have the potential to be a disease modifying therapeutic for Parkinsons disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Though root architecture modifications may be critically important for improving phosphorus (P) efficiency in crops, the regulatory mechanisms triggering these changes remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that genotypic variation in GmEXPB2 expression is strongly correlated with root elongation and P acquisition efficiency, and enhancing its transcription significantly improves soybean yield in the field. Promoter deletion analysis was performed using six 5 truncation fragments (P1-P6) of GmEXPB2 fused with the GUS reporter gene in transgenic hairy roots, which revealed that the P1 segment containing 3 E-box elements significantly enhances induction of gene expression in response to phosphate (Pi) starvation. Further experimentation demonstrated that GmPTF1, a bHLH transcription factor, is the regulatory factor responsible for the induction of GmEXPB2 expression in response to Pi starvation. In short, Pi starvation induced expression of GmPTF1, with the GmPTF1 product not only directly binding the E-box motif in the P1 region of the GmEXPB2 promoter, but also activating GUS expression in a dosage dependent manner. Further work with soybean transgenic composite plants showed that, altering GmPTF1 expression significantly impacted GmEXPB2 transcription, and thereby affected root growth, biomass and P uptake. Taken together, this work identifies a novel regulatory factor, GmPTF1, involved in changing soybean root architecture through regulation the expression of GmEXPB2. These findings contribute to understanding the molecular basis of root architecture modifications in response to P deficiency, and, in the process, suggest candidate genes and a promoter region to target for improving soybean yield through molecular breeding of P efficiency.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe bHLH transcription factor GmPTF1 regulates the expression of {beta}-expansin gene GmEXPB2 to modify root architecture, and thus promote phosphate acquisition, and biomass in soybean.",

    "abstract": "2-photon intravital microscopy (2P-IVM) is a key technique to investigate cell migration and cell-to-cell interactions in organs and tissues of living organisms. Focusing on immunology, 2P-IVM allowed recording videos of leukocytes during the immune response, highlighting unprecedented mechanisms of the immune system. However, the automatic analysis of the acquired videos remains challenging and poorly reproducible. In fact, both manual curation of results and tuning of bioimaging software parameters among different experiments, are required. One of the most difficult tasks for a user is transferring to a computer the knowledge on what a cell is and how it should appear with respect to the background, other objects, or other cell types. This is possibly due to the low specificity of acquisition channels which may include multiple cell populations and the presence of similar objects in the background.\n\nIn this work, we propose a method based on semi-supervised machine learning to facilitate colocalization. In line with recently proposed approaches for pixel classification, the method requires the user to draw some lines on the cells of interest and some line on the other objects/background. These lines embed knowledge, not only on which pixel belongs to a class or which pixel belongs to another class but also on how pixels in the same object are connected. Hence, the proposed method exploits the information from the lines to create an additional imaging channel that is specific for the cells fo interest. The usage of this method increased tracking accuracy on a dataset of challenging 2P-IVM videos of leukocytes. Additionally, it allowed processing multiple samples of the same experiment keeping the same mathematical model.",

    "abstract": "Taxon sampling is a central aspect of phylogenetic study design, but it has received limited attention in the context of molecular dating and especially in the framework of total-evidence dating, a widely used dating approach that directly integrates molecular and morphological information from extant and fossil taxa. We here assess the impact of different outgroup sampling schemes on age estimates in a total-evidence dating analysis under the uniform tree prior. Our study group are Pimpliformes, a highly diverse, rapidly radiating group of parasitoid wasps of the family Ichneumonidae. We cover 201 extant and 79 fossil taxa, including the oldest fossils of the family from the Early Cretaceous and the first unequivocal representatives of extant subfamilies from the mid Paleogene. Based on newly compiled molecular data from ten nuclear genes and a morphological matrix that includes 222 characters, we show that age estimates become both older and less precise with the inclusion of more distant and more poorly sampled outgroups. In addition, we discover an artefact that might be detrimental for total-evidence dating: \"bare-branch attraction\", namely high attachment probabilities of, especially, older fossils to terminal branches for which morphological data are missing. After restricting outgroup sampling and adding morphological data for the previously attracting, bare branches, we recover a Middle and Early Jurassic origin for Pimpliformes and Ichneumonidae, respectively. This first age estimate for the group not only suggests an older origin than previously thought, but also that diversification of the crown group happened before the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Our case study demonstrates that in order to obtain robust age estimates, total-evidence dating studies need to be based on a thorough and balanced sampling of both extant and fossil taxa, with the aim of minimizing evolutionary rate heterogeneity and missing morphological information.",

    "abstract": "Rational compound design remains a challenging problem for both computational methods and medicinal chemists. Computational generative methods have begun to show promising results for the design problem. However, they have not yet used the power of 3D structural information. We have developed a novel graph-based deep generative model that combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with structural knowledge. Our method (\\\"DeLinker\\\") takes two fragments or partial structures and designs a molecule incorporating both. The generation process is protein context dependent, utilising the relative distance and orientation between the partial structures. This 3D information is vital to successful compound design, and we demonstrate its impact on the generation process and the limitations of omitting such information. In a large scale evaluation, DeLinker designed 60% more molecules with high 3D similarity to the original molecule than a database baseline. When considering the more relevant problem of longer linkers with at least five atoms, the outperformance increased to 200%. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of this approach on a diverse range of design problems: fragment linking, scaffold hopping, and proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) design. As far as we are aware, this is the first molecular generative model to incorporate 3D structural information directly in the design process. Code is available at https://github.com/oxpig/DeLinker.",

    "abstract": "Co-infections shape the host immune status, thereby influencing the development of inflammatory diseases, which can result in detrimental or beneficial effects. For example, co-infections with concurrent Plasmodium species can alter malaria clinical evolution and malaria infection itself has the ability to modulate autoimmune reactions but, in both cases, the underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined.\\n\\nHere, we demonstrate that the protective effects of certain rodent malaria strains on T cell-mediated inflammatory pathologies are due to an RNA virus co-hosted in malaria-parasitized blood. We show that live as well as extracts of blood parasitized by P. berghei K173 or P. yoelii 17X YM, confer full protection against Pb ANKA (PbA)-induced Experimental Cerebral Malaria (ECM) and MOG/CFA-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and that this is associated with a strong type I IFN signature. We detected the presence of a viral element, the RNA virus Lactate Dehydrogenase-elevating Virus (LDV), in the protective Plasmodium stabilates and we established that infection with LDV alone recapitulates the protective effects on ECM and EAE. In ECM, we further show that protection results from an IFN-I-mediated reduction in the abundance of splenic conventional dendritic cell and in their ability to produce the Th1-inducing IL-12p70, leading to a decrease in pathogenic CD4+ Th1 responses. In EAE, protection is achieved by IFN-I mediated blunting of IL-12 and IL-23, preventing the differentiation of IFN-{gamma}-, IL-17- and GM-CSF-producing encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells.\\n\\nThus, our results identify a virus that is co-hosted in several Plasmodium stabilates across the community and has major consequences on the host immune system. Moreover, our data emphasize the importance of considering concurrent infections for the understanding of autoimmunity and malaria-associated inflammatory complications.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death due to a single infectious disease. Knowing when a person was infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is critical as recent infection is the strongest clinical risk factor for progression to TB disease in immunocompetent individuals. However, time since M.tb infection is challenging to determine in routine clinical practice. To define a biomarker for recent TB exposure, we determined whether gene expression patterns in blood RNA correlated with time since M.tb infection or exposure. First, we found RNA signatures that accurately discriminated early and late time periods after experimental infection in mice and cynomolgus macaques. Next, we found a 6-gene blood RNA signature that identified recently exposed individuals in two independent human cohorts, including adult household contacts of TB cases and adolescents who recently acquired M.tb infection. Our work supports the need for future longitudinal studies of recent TB contacts to determine whether biomarkers of recent infection can provide prognostic information of TB disease risk in individuals and help map recent transmission in communities.",

    "abstract": "Conventional deep neural networks capture essential information processing stages in perception. Deep neural networks often require very large volume of training examples, whereas children can learn concepts such as hand-written digits with few examples. The goal of this project is to develop a deep spiking neural network that can learn from few training trials. Using known neuronal mechanisms, a spiking neural network model is developed and trained to recognize hand-written digits with presenting one to four training examples for each digit taken from the MNIST database. The model detects and learns geometric features of the images from MNIST database. In this work, a novel biological back-propagation based learning rule is developed and used to a train the network to detect basic features of different digits. For this purpose, randomly initialized synaptic weights between the layers are being updated. By using a neuroscience inspired mechanism named  synaptic pruning and a predefined threshold, some of the synapses through the training are deleted. Hence, information channels are constructed that are highly specific for each digit as matrix of synaptic connections between two layers of spiking neural networks. These connection matrixes named  information channels are used in the test phase to assign a digit class to each test image. As similar to humans abilities to learn from small training trials, the developed spiking neural network needs a very small dataset for training, compared to conventional deep learning methods checked on MNIST dataset.",

The underlying signaling mechanisms of neurovascular coupling remain unclear, but are critical for brain function and establish the diagnostic power of BOLD-fMRI. Here, we described a mosaic of pericytes, the vasomotor capillary cells in the living retina. We then tested if this symmetric net of pericytes and surrounding neuroglia predicted a connectivity map in response to sensory stimuli. Surprisingly, we found that these connections were not only discriminatory across cell types, but also highly asymmetric spatially. First, pericytes connected predominantly to other neighboring pericytes and endothelial cells, and less to arteriolar smooth muscle cells, and not to surrounding neurons or glia. Second, focal, but not global stimulation evoked a directional vasomotor response by strengthening connections along the feeding vascular branch. This activity required local NO signaling and occurred by means of direct coupling via gap-junctions. By contrast, bath application of NO or diabetes, a common microvascular pathology, not only weakened the vascular signaling but also abolished its directionality. We conclude that the discriminatory nature of neurovascular interactions may thus establish spatial accuracy of blood delivery with the precision of the neuronal receptive field size, and is disrupted early in microvascular disease.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWithin a structurally symmetric mosaic, pericytes form discriminatory connections\\nC_LIO_LIPericyte connectome tunes with a precision matching a neuronal receptive field\\nC_LIO_LIFocal but not global input evokes a vasomotor response by strengthening the gap-junction mediated signaling towards a feeding vascular branch\\nC_LIO_LIDisrupted functional connectivity map triggers loss of the functional hyperemia in diabetic neuropathy\\nC_LI",

We aimed to examine if such diets induce different improvements in body composition and glucose tolerance under conditions of caloric restriction (CR) in obese mice.\n\nMethodsMale C57BL/6J mice (n = 20) were fed obesogenic diet (45 and 17.5% kcal from fat and sugar) ad libitum for 18 weeks and then subjected to 6-week CR which progressively increased up to 40% using either Low Fat diet (20, 60, 20% kcal from fat, carbohydrate, protein, n = 10) or Low Carb diet (20, 60, 20% kcal from carbohydrate, fat, protein, n = 10). Mice fed regular chow diet ad libitum served as controls (n = 10). Body mass, hind limb muscle mass, fat mass, energy expenditure and glucose tolerance were compared between the groups.\n\nResultsLow Fat and Low Carb groups had similar body mass (p > 0.05) prior to CR which was 30% greater compared to control group (p < 0.001). CR resulted in weight loss with no differences between Low Fat and Low Carb groups (30.0 {+/-} 5.6 and 23.8 {+/-} 7.5%, p > 0.05). Weight loss was mainly due to fat loss in both groups. Energy expenditure of freely moving mice did not differ between the groups (p > 0.05). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test improved compared to control group (p < 0.05) and values before CR (p < 0.01) but without differences between Low Fat and Low Carb groups (p > 0.05).\n\nConclusionsDietary carbohydrate or fat content when protein is equated does not play a significant role for body composition and metabolic health benefits of caloric restriction in obese mice.",

    "abstract": "Skin is our primary barrier to the outside world, protecting us from physical, biological and chemical threats. Developing innovative products that preserve and improve skin barrier function requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying barrier response to topical applications. In many fields, computer simulations already facilitate understanding, thus accelerating innovation. Simulations of software models allow scientists to test hypothesized mechanisms by comparing predicted results to physical observations. They also enable virtual product optimization, without physical experiments, once mechanisms have been validated. The physical accessibility and abundant knowledge of skin structure makes it a prime candidate for computational modeling. In this article, we describe a computational multiscale multicellular skin model used to simulate growth and response of the epidermal barrier. The model integrates several modeling styles and mathematical frameworks including ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, discrete agent-based modeling and discrete element methods. Specifically, to capture cell biology and physical transport, we combined four distinct sub-models from existing literature. We also implemented methods for elastic biomechanics. Our software implementation of the model is compatible with the high-performance computing simulation platform Biocellion. The integrated model recapitulates barrier formation, homeostasis and response to environmental, chemical and mechanical perturbation. This work exemplifies methodology for integrating models of vastly different styles. The methodology enables us to effectively build on existing knowledge and produce \"whole-system\" tissue models capable of displaying emergent properties. It also illustrates the inherent technical difficulties associated with the mounting complexity of describing biological systems at high fidelity. Among the challenges are validation of the science, the mathematical representations approximating the science and the software implementing these representations. Responsibility for a discrepancy observed between in silico and in vitro results may as easily lie at one of these three levels as at another, demanding that any sustainable modeling endeavor engage expertise from biology, mathematics and computing.",

    "abstract": "In vivo imaging of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing activity revealed that infected cells have a higher observed probability of dying after multiple contacts with CTLs, suggesting memory effect in CTLs or infected cells. We developed a three-dimensional agent-based model of CTL killing activity to discriminate different hypotheses about how infected cells get killed based on quantitative 2-photon in vivo observations. We compared a constant CTL killing probability with mechanisms of signal integration in CTL or infected cells. The most likely scenario implied increased susceptibility of infected cells with increasing number of CTL contacts where the total number of contacts was a critical factor as opposed to signal integration over many contacts. However, when allowing in silico T cells to interact with apoptotic target cells (zombie contacts), a contact history independent killing mechanism was also in agreement with the experimental datasets. We showed that contacts that take place between CTLs and dying infected cells impact the observed killing dynamics because even in absence of modulation of cell properties, we saw an increase of the observed probability of killing infected cells with more interactions. The duration taken by an infected cell to die and the per capita killing rate (PCKR) of CTLs, parameters hard to measure directly, were determined from the model and turned out predictive to distinguish the different CTL killing models in future experiments. The comparison of observed datasets to simulation results, revealed limitations in interpreting 2-photon data, and provided prediction for additional measurements to distinguish CTL killing models.\n\nHighlightsO_LIKilling of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells typically involves more than a single contact.\nC_LIO_LICytotoxic T cells or infected cells integrate signals from multiple interactions.\nC_LIO_LIT cell contacts with dying infected cells have a major impact on in vivo data interpretation.\nC_LI\n\nSignificance StatementDespite having a clear understanding of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms, the quantitative dynamics remain unexplored at a cellular level. We developed an agent-based model to compare different hypotheses for mechanisms of CTL mediated cytotoxicity that could lead to an increase in observed probability of killing infected cells at higher interactions with CTLs as seen in vivo. We showed that this behaviour can be explained by modulation of properties by infected cells or CTLs with increasing number of contacts. For the modulation, we compared two modes of signal integration and showed that time is not a relevant parameter in signal integration. We also studied the impact of contacts between CTLs and apoptotic infected cells on observed killing properties.",

But this MD technique produces large-size and long-timescale data that are inherently high-dimensional and occupies many terabytes of data. Processing this immense amount of data in a meaningful way is becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, specific dimensionality reduction algorithm using deep learning technique has been employed here to embed the high-dimensional data in a lower-dimension latent space that still preserves the inherent molecular characteristics i.e. retains biologically meaningful information. Subsequently, the results of the embedding models are visualized for model evaluation and analysis of the extracted underlying features. However, most of the existing visualizations for embeddings have limitations in evaluating the embedding models and understanding the complex simulation data. We propose an interactive visual analytics system for embeddings of MD simulations to not only evaluate and explain an embedding model but also analyze various characteristics of the simulations. Our system enables exploration and discovery of meaningful and semantic embedding results and supports the understanding and evaluation of results by the quantitatively described features of the MD simulations (even without specific labels).",

Here we apply RAD sequencing data and newly developed population genomic approaches to identify putative inversions that differentiate a sand dune ecotype of the prairie sunflower (Helianthus petiolaris) from populations found on the adjacent sand sheet. We detected seven large genomic regions that exhibit a different population structure than the rest of the genome and that vary in frequency between dune and non-dune populations. These regions also show high linkage disequilibrium and high heterozygosity between, but not within haplotypes, consistent with the behavior of large inversions, an inference subsequently validated in part by comparative genetic mapping. Genome-environment association analyses show that key environmental variables, including vegetation cover and soil nitrogen, are significantly associated with inversions. The inversions co-locate with previously described \\\"islands of differentiation,\\\" and appear to play an important role in adaptive divergence and incipient speciation within H. petiolaris.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory and catabolic pathways are differentially distributed in microbial genomes. Thus, specific carbon sources may favor different respiratory processes. We profiled the influence of 94 carbon sources on the end-products of nitrate respiration in microbial enrichment cultures from diverse terrestrial environments. We found that some carbon sources consistently favor dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA/nitrate ammonification) while other carbon sources favor nitrite accumulation or denitrification. For an enrichment culture from aquatic sediment, we sequenced the genomes of the most abundant strains, matched these genomes to 16S rDNA exact sequence variants (ESVs), and used 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to track the differential enrichment of functionally distinct ESVs on different carbon sources. We found that changes in the abundances of strains with different genetic potentials for nitrite accumulation, DNRA or denitrification were correlated with the nitrite or ammonium concentrations in the enrichment cultures recovered on different carbon sources. Specifically, we found that either L-sorbose or D-cellobiose enriched for a Klebsiella nitrite accumulator, other sugars enriched for an Escherichia nitrate ammonifier, and citrate or formate enriched for a Pseudomonas denitrifier and a Sulfurospirillum nitrate ammonifier. Our results add important nuance to the current paradigm that higher concentrations of carbon will always favor DNRA over denitrification or nitrite accumulation, and we propose that, in some cases, carbon composition can be as important as carbon concentration in determining nitrate respiratory end-products. Furthermore, our approach can be extended to other environments and metabolisms to characterize how selective parameters influence microbial community composition, gene content and function.",

We found that the WD had a pro- C. difficile bile acid composition that was driven in part by higher levels of primary bile acids that are produced to digest fat, and a lower level of secondary bile acids that are produced by the gut microbiome. This lack of secondary bile acids was associated with a greater disturbance to the gut microbiome with antibiotics in both the WD and LF/LF diet compared to mouse chow. Mice fed the WD also had the highest level of toxin TcdA just prior to the onset of mortality, but not of TcdB or increased inflammation. These findings indicate that dietary intervention to decrease fat may complement previously proposed dietary intervention strategies to prevent CDI in high-risk individuals.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA high-fat/low-fiber Western type diet promoted mortality in a mouse model of antibiotic-induced C. difficile infection compared to a low-fat/low-fiber diet and chow diet, suggesting that lower dietary fat may be an effective strategy for preventing C. difficile pathology.",

    "abstract": "Previous research utilising a between-subjects design has indicated that the use of noise-dampening ear-protectors might enhance interoceptive accuracy (IAcc). In the present study, we further examined this effect using a repeated-measures, within-participants design, and investigated potential mechanisms that might explain the effect. 50 participants completed the heartbeat tracking task (HTT) with and without the use of industrial ear-protectors, in a counter-balanced order. Participants were asked to count the number of heartbeats occurring in five discrete time intervals of 25, 35, 45, 55 and 95 seconds, without feeling for a manual pulse. HTT scores were significantly higher when ear-protectors were worn, and the improvement in performance was greatest for participants with lower baseline IAcc. The ear-protectors were associated with significantly increased self-reported heartbeat audibility, task-related confidence and concentration, and decreased levels of distractibility. Heartbeat audibility was also correlated with HTT performance when the ear-protectors were worn. Because the use of industrial ear defenders resulted in increased heartbeat audibility, this manipulation should not be used to assess causal hypotheses related to changes in IAcc. However, it may serve as a simple, non-invasive manipulation to assess the effects of  externalised interoceptive signals.\n\nHighlightsO_LIEar-protectors elicit an improvement in performance on the heartbeat tracking task\nC_LIO_LIThis improvement is greatest for participants with lower baseline accuracy\nC_LIO_LIThe improvement is associated with the auditory perception of the heartbeat\nC_LIO_LIPrior use of ear-protectors did not result in later enhanced performance on the control condition without ear-protectors.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A key aspect of human cognitive flexibility concerns the ability to convert complex symbolic instructions into novel behaviors. Previous research proposes that this transformation is supported by two neurocognitive states: an initial declarative maintenance of task knowledge, and an implementation state necessary for optimal task execution. Furthermore, current models predict a crucial role of frontal and parietal brain regions in this process. However, whether declarative and procedural signals independently contribute to implementation remains unknown. We report the results of an fMRI experiment in which participants executed novel instructed stimulus-response associations. We then used a pattern-tracking procedure to quantify the contribution of format-unique signals during instruction implementation. This revealed independent procedural and declarative representations of novel S-Rs in frontoparietal areas, prior to execution. Critically, the degree of procedural activation predicted subsequent behavioral performance. Altogether, our results suggest an important contribution of frontoparietal regions to the neural architecture that regulates cognitive flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Skilled reading requires years of practice associating visual symbols with speech sounds. Over the course of the learning process, this association becomes effortless and automatic. Here we test whether automatic activation of spoken-language circuits in response to visual words is a hallmark of skilled reading. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure word-selective responses under multiple cognitive tasks (N = 42, 7-12 years of age). Even when attention was drawn away from the words by performing an attention-demanding fixation task, strong word-selective responses were found in a language region (i.e., superior temporal gyrus) starting at ~300 ms after stimulus onset. Critically, this automatic word-selective response was indicative of reading skill: the magnitude of word-selective responses correlated with individual reading skill. Our results suggest that automatic recruitment of spoken-language circuits is a hallmark of skilled reading; with practice, reading becomes effortless as the brain learns to automatically translate letters into sounds and meaning.",

    "abstract": "Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.\\n\\nSignificance statementWhen we touch our hand with the other, the resulting sensation feels less intense than when another person or a machine touches our hand with the same intensity. Early computational motor control theories have proposed that the cerebellum predicts and cancels the sensory consequences of our movements; however, the neural correlates of this cancelation remain unknown. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the more participants attenuate the perception of their self-generated touch, the stronger the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the somatosensory cortical areas. This provides conclusive evidence about the role of the cerebellum in predicting the sensory feedback of our movements and in attenuating the associated percepts via its connections to early somatosensory areas.",

    "abstract": "Survival of an organism requires mechanisms to sense damaging factors in the environment. In mammals, bacterial toxins and inflammatory mediators stimulate nociceptive sensory neurons to activate protective reflexes. Whereas the vagus nerve reflex circuit that protects against damaging inflammation, termed the \"inflammatory reflex,\" was described more than twenty years ago1,2, how the vagus nerve detects inflammation to initiate the inflammatory reflex has remained unknown. Here we show that transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) in sensory vagus neurons is required to sense interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), a central cytokine mediator of inflammation and injury. Selective activation of vagus nerve TRPA1 using optopharmacology stimulated the inflammatory reflex to inhibit innate inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and IL-1{beta}. Proximity ligation assay and immunohistochemistry revealed that IL-1 receptors are co-expressed with TRPA1 in vagus sensory neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings reveal that TRPA1 is required to mediate IL-1{beta}-dependent depolarization of vagus sensory neurons. Further, TRPA1-deficient mice lack inflammatory reflex attenuation of inflammation, fail to restrain cytokine release, and have significantly enhanced lethality to bacterial sepsis. Therefore, vagus neurons expressing TRPA1 are necessary and sufficient to activate the sensory arc of the inflammatory reflex to protect against harmful inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Impaired mitochondrial function concomitant to enhanced oxidative stress-induced damage are well established mechanisms involved in hyperlipidemia-induced cardiotoxicity. Coenzyme Q9/10 (CoQ) is known to be a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that efficiently supports the process of bioenergetics in addition to its antioxidant activities. However, there is very limited information on the direct effect of myocardial lipid overload on endogenous CoQ levels in association with mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress status. Here, such effects were explored by exposing H9c2 cardiomyocytes to various doses (0.15 to 1 mM) of palmitate for 24 hours. The results demonstrated that palmitate doses [&ge;] 0.25 mM are enough to impair mitochondrial respiration and cause oxidative stress. Although endogenous CoQ levels are enhanced by palmitate doses [&le;] 5 mM, this is not enough to counteract oxidative stress, but is sufficient to maintain cell viability of cardiomyocytes, suggesting a compensation mechanism. Palmitate doses > 5 mM caused severe mitochondrial toxicity, including reduction of cell viability. Interestingly, enhancement of CoQ levels with the lowest dose of palmitate (0.15 mM) was accompanied by a significantly reduction of CoQ oxidation status, as well as low cytosolic production of reactive oxygen species. From the overall findings, it appears that CoQ response may be crucial to improve mitochondrial function and thus protect against hyperlipidemia-induced insult. These results further suggest that therapeutic agents that can stimulate endogenous levels of CoQ may be beneficial in protecting the myocardium against diabetes associated complications.",

However, the origin of this dysfunctional epithelium remains unknown.\\n\\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of a pro-fibrotic milieu, similar to that found in an IPF lung, on human alveolar epithelial progenitor cell differentiation. We developed an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived air-liquid interface (ALI) model of alveolar type II (ATII)-like cell differentiation and stimulated it with an IPF-relevant cocktail (IPF-RC), composed of cytokines previously reported to be elevated in IPF lungs. iPSC-derived cultures express ATII markers and contain lamellar body-like structures. Stimulation with IPF-RC during the last two weeks of differentiation increases secretion of IPF biomarkers. Transcriptome analysis of IPF-RC treated cultures reveals significant overlap with human IPF data and enrichment of transcripts associated with extracellular matrix organization. IPF-RC stimulation further impairs ATII differentiation by driving a shift towards an airway epithelial-like expression signature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we show for the first time, the establishment of a human model system that recapitulates aspects of IPF-associated bronchiolization in vitro. Our findings reveal how aberrant alveolar epithelial progenitor cell differentiation in a pro-fibrotic environment could contribute to alveolar bronchiolization in the distal IPF lung.\\n\\nSOURCE OF SUPPORTThe research was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.

This leakiness is concerning as it increases vaccination coverage required to prevent disease spread, and can promote evolution of increased pathogen virulence. Despite leakiness, vaccination may reduce pathogen load, affecting disease transmission dynamics. However, the impacts on post-transmission disease development and infectiousness in contact individuals are unknown. Here, we use transmission experiments involving Mareks disease virus in chickens to show that vaccination with a leaky vaccine substantially reduces viral load in both vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated contact individuals they infect. Consequently, contact birds are less likely to develop disease symptoms or die, show less severe symptoms, and shed less infectious virus themselves, when infected by vaccinated birds. These results highlight that even partial vaccination with a leaky vaccine can have unforeseen positive consequences in controlling the spread and symptoms of disease.",

CIPN primarily affects unmyelinated nociceptive sensory terminals. Despite the high prevalence of CIPN, molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to CIPN are still poorly understood. Here, we used a genetically tractable Drosophila model and primary sensory neurons isolated from adult mouse to examine the mechanisms underlying CIPN and identify protective pathways. We found that chronic treatment of Drosophila larvae with paclitaxel caused sensory neuron degeneration, altered the terminal branching pattern of nociceptive neurons, and reduced thermal nociceptive responses. We found that nociceptive neuron-specific overexpression of integrins, which are known to support neuronal maintenance in several systems, conferred protection from paclitaxel-mediated cellular and behavioral phenotypes. Live imaging and superresolution approaches provide evidence that paclitaxel treatment causes cellular changes that are consistent with alterations in endosome-mediated trafficking of integrins. We used primary dorsal root ganglia neuron cultures to test conservation of integrin-mediated protection. We show that overexpression of a human integrin {beta} subunit 1 (ITGB1) also prevented degeneration following paclitaxel treatment. Altogether, our study supports conserved mechanisms of paclitaxel-induced perturbation of integrin trafficking and a therapeutic potential of restoring integrin levels to antagonize paclitaxel-mediated toxicity in sensory neurons.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memory establishes and stores relations among the different elements of an experience, which are often similar and difficult to distinguish. Pattern separation, implemented by the dentate gyrus, is a neural mechanism that allows the discrimination of similar experiences by orthogonalizing synaptic inputs. Granule cells support such disambiguation by sparse rate coding, a process tightly controlled by highly diversified GABAergic neuronal populations, such as somatostatin-expressing cells which directly target the dendritic arbor of granule cells, massively innervated by entorhinal inputs reaching the molecular layer and conveying contextual information. Here, we tested the hypothesis that somatostatin neurons regulate the excitability of the dentate gyrus, thus controlling the efficacy of pattern separation during memory encoding in mice. Indeed, optogenetic suppression of dentate gyrus somatostatin neurons increased spiking activity in putative excitatory neurons and triggered dentate spikes. Moreover, optical inhibition of somatostatin neurons impaired both contextual and spatial discrimination of overlapping episodic-like memories during task acquisition. Importantly, effects were specific for similar environments, suggesting that pattern separation was selectively engaged when overlapping conditions ought to be distinguished. Overall, our results suggest that somatostatin cells regulate excitability in the dentate gyrus and are required for effective pattern separation during episodic memory encoding.\\n\\nSignificance statementMemory systems must be able to discriminate stored representations of similar experiences in order to efficiently guide future decisions. This is solved by pattern separation, implemented in the dentate gyrus by granule cells to support episodic memory formation. The tonic inhibitory bombardment produced by multiple GABAergic cell populations maintains low activity levels in granule cells, permitting the process of pattern separation. Somatostatin-expressing cells are one of those interneuron populations, selectively targeting the distal dendrites of granule cells, where cortical multimodal information reaches the dentate gyrus. Hence, somatostatin cells constitute an ideal candidate to regulate pattern separation. Here, by using optogenetic stimulation in mice, we demonstrate that somatostatin cells are required for the acquisition of both contextual and spatial overlapping memories.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic islets adapt to insulin resistance of pregnancy by up regulating {beta}-cell proliferation and increase insulin secretion. Previously, we found that prolactin receptor (Prlr) signaling is important for this process, as heterozygous prolactin receptor-null (Prlr+/-) mice are glucose intolerant, had a lower number of {beta} cells and lower serum insulin levels than wild type mice during pregnancy. However, since Prlr expression is ubiquitous, to determine its {beta}-cell specific effects, we generated a transgenic mouse with a floxed Prlr allele under the control of an inducible promoter, allowing conditional deletion of Prlr from {beta} cells in adult mice. In this study, we found that {beta}-cell-specific Prlr reduction resulted in elevated blood glucose during pregnancy. Similar to our previous finding in mouse with global Prlr reduction, {beta}-cell-specific Prlr loss led to a lower {beta}-cell mass and a lower in vivo insulin level during pregnancy. However, these islets do not have an intrinsic insulin secretion defect when tested in vitro. Interestingly, when we compared the islet gene expression profile, using islets isolated from mice with global versus {beta}-cell-specific Prlr reduction, we found some important differences in genes that regulate apoptosis and insulin secretion. This suggests that Prlr has both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effect on {beta} cells, beyond its regulation of pro-proliferative genes.",

The model consisted of two compartments: (a) a healthy bone tissue mimic, poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/beta-tricalcium phosphate ({beta}-TCP) sponge that was seeded with human fetal osteoblastic cells (hFOB) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and (b) a tumor mimic, a lyophilized collagen sponge that was seeded with human osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2). The tumor component was introduced to a central cavity created in the healthy bone mimic and together they constituted the total 3D model (3D-BTM). The scaffolds were characterized by determining their mechanical properties, studying their topography and stability with compression tests, microCT, SEM, confocal microscopy and gravimetry. Porosities of the sponges were determined from {micro}CT data as 96.7% and 86% for PLGA/TCP and collagen sponges, respectively. The average diameters of the pores were measured by using ImageJ (NIH, USA) as 199{+/-}52 {micro}m for PLGA/TCP and 50-150 m for collagen scaffolds. Young modulus of the PLGA/TCP and collagen sponges were determined as 4.76MPa and 140kPa, respectively. Cells seeded on the two sponges were studied independently and together on the BTM. Cell proliferation, morphology, calcium phosphate forming capacity and ALP production were studied on both healthy bone and tumor mimics. All types of cells showed cellular extensions and spread on and in the scaffolds indicating good cell-material interactions. Angiogenic developments in BTM were studied along with migration of cells between the components with immunocytochemistry, SEM, microCT, qRT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. Confocal microscopy showed that a direct contact was established between the cells present in different parts of the BTM; and the HUVEC cells within the healthy bone mimic were observed to migrate into the tumor mimic. This was confirmed by the increase in the levels of angiogenic factors VEGF, bFGF, and IL-8 in the tumor component. The IC50 of Doxorubicin on Saos-2 cells was determined as 0.1876 {micro}g.mL-1. Doxorubicin was administered to the BTM at 2.7 {micro}g.mL-1 concentration and after allowing one day for interaction, the cell number was determined with Alamar Blue cell viability test as 7-fold lesser compared to 24 h earlier. Apoptosis of the osteosarcoma cells was measured by caspase-3 enzyme activity assay. These results demonstrate the suitability of the 3D BTM model for use in the investigation of activities and migrations of cells in a tumor tissue. These will be very useful in studying metastatic capabilities of cells in addition to personalized drug treatments.",

Auroramycin is a potent anti-MRSA polyene macrolactam. In addition, it also displays antifungal activities, which is unique among structurally similar polyene macrolactams, such as incednine and silvalactam. In this work, we employed different engineering strategies to target glycosylation and acylation biosynthetic machineries within its recently elucidated biosynthetic pathway. Six auroramycin analogs with variations in C-, N-methylation, hydroxylation and extender units incorporation were produced and characterized. By comparing the bioactivity profiles of these analogs, we determined that unique disaccharide motif of auroramycin is essential for its antimicrobial bioactivity. We further demonstrated that C-methylation of the 3, 5-epi-lemonose unit, which is unique among structurally similar polyene macrolactams, is key to its antifungal activity.",

    "abstract": "Over 80% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients in the United States die with bone metastases. Second-line hormonal therapies, such as enzalutamide, improve overall survival in about 50% of patients with bone metastases, but almost all responsive patients eventually develop enzalutamide resistance. Our study showed that although enzalutamide significantly inhibited the tumor growth of subcutaneously or orthotopically grafted PCa C4-2B cells, it had no effect on the bone lesion development when C4-2B tumors were grafted in the bone, suggesting a crucial role of the microenvironment in enzalutamide resistance in PCa bone metastasis. We found that enzalutamide significantly decreased the amount of the TGFBR2 (TGF-{beta} type II receptor) in osteoblasts, both in vitro and in patient samples. The osteoblast-specific knockout of Tgfbr2 significantly induced bone metastasis. We showed that the enzalutamide-induced TGFBR2 decrease in osteoblasts was mediated by increased PTH1R (parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptide receptor), which resulted in TGFBR2 degradation, and that blocking PTH1R rescued the TGFBR2 decrease. Furthermore, we found that PTH1R up-regulation by enzalutamide was correlated with increased Pth1r promoter occupancy by transcription factor NR2F1. Our findings highlight a potential enzalutamide-resistance mechanism through TGFBR2 decrease in osteoblasts, thus suggesting future PTH1R-blocking approaches to overcome enzalutamide resistance in PCa bone metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Teratoma formation remains a safety concern in therapeutic cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Residual Teratoma forming cells are present in small numbers in differentiated hiPSC cultures and yet are of significant roadblock to the manufacturing and clinical translation of stem cell therapies. Rare cells are often difficult to remove with standard flow cytometry or magnetic bead sorting techniques. Here, we first characterized time-dependent expression of a teratoma marker, stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-5, which binds the H type-1 glycan during neural differentiation of hiPSCs. We engineered a microfluidic geometrically enhanced differential immunocapture (GEDI) technology to remove SSEA-5+ rare cells from hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiPSC-NPCs). The GEDI chip presents a facile tool to potentially functionalize with multiple antibodies and robustly enhance hiPSC-derived cell population safety prior to therapeutic transplantation. The approach is potentially amenable to generate a wide variety of high-quality therapeutic cells and can be integrated within the pipeline of cell manufacturing to improve patient safety and reduce the cost of manufacturing through early removal of undesirable cell types.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented challenge to feed the rapidly growing human population can only be achieved with major changes in how we combine technology with agronomy1. Despite their potential few beneficial microbes have truly been demonstrated to significantly increase productivity of globally important crops in real farming conditions2,3. The way microbes are employed has largely ignored the successes of crop breeding where naturally occurring intraspecific variation of plants has been used to increase yields. Doing this with microbes requires establishing a link between variation in the microbes and quantitative traits of crop growth along with a clear demonstration that intraspecific microbial variation can potentially lead to large differences in crop productivity in real farming conditions. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), form symbioses with globally important crops and show great potential to improve crop yields2. Here we demonstrate the first link between patterns of genome-wide intraspecific AMF variation and productivity of the globally important food crop cassava. Cassava, one of the most important food security crops, feeds approximately 800 million people daily4. In subsequent field trials, inoculation with genetically different isolates of the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis altered cassava root productivity by up to 1.46-fold in conventional cultivation in Colombia. In independent field trials in Colombia, Kenya and Tanzania, clonal sibling progeny of homokaryon and dikaryon parental AMF enormously altered cassava root productivity by up to 3 kg per plant and up to a 3.69-fold productivity difference. Siblings were clonal and, thus, qualitatively genetically identical. Heterokaryon siblings can vary quantitatively but monokaryon siblings are identical. Very large among-AMF sibling effects were observed at each location although which sibling AMF was most effective depended strongly on location and cassava variety. We demonstrate the enormous potential of genetic, and possibly epigenetic variation, in AMF to greatly alter productivity of a globally important crop that should not be ignored. A microbial improvement program to accelerate crop yield increases over that possible by plant breeding or GMO technology alone is feasible. However, such a paradigm shift can only be realised if researchers address how plant genetics and local environments affect mycorrhizal responsiveness of crops to predict which fungal variant will be effective in a given location.",

    "abstract": "How the brain representation of conceptual knowledge vary as a function of processing goals, strategies and task-factors remains a key unresolved question in cognitive neuroscience. Here we asked how the brain representation of semantic categories is shaped by the depth of processing during mental simulation. Participants were presented with visual words during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During shallow processing, participants had to read the items. During deep processing, they had to mentally simulate the features associated with the words. Multivariate classification, informational connectivity and encoding models were used to reveal how the depth of processing determines the brain representation of word meaning. Decoding accuracy in putative substrates of the semantic network was enhanced when the depth processing was high, and the brain representations were more generalizable in semantic space relative to shallow processing contexts. This pattern was observed even in association areas in inferior frontal and parietal cortex. Deep information processing during mental simulation also increased the informational connectivity within key substrates of the semantic network. To further examine the properties of the words encoded in brain activity, we compared computer vision models - associated with the image referents of the words - and word embedding. Computer vision models explained more variance of the brain responses across multiple areas of the semantic network. These results indicate that the brain representation of word meaning is highly malleable by the depth of processing imposed by the task, relies on access to visual representations and is highly distributed, including prefrontal areas previously implicated in semantic control.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlatelet factor 4 is a cytokine released into the bloodstream by activated platelets and plays a pivotal role in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia etiology and diagnosis. Therefore, a sustainable source of recombinant PF4 with structural and functional similarity to its native form is urgently needed to be used in diagnostic procedures.\n\nTo this end, a three-in-one primary construct was designed and custom synthesized based on the pET26b backbone from which three secondary constructs could be derived each capable of employing either type I, type II secretory or cytoplasmic pathways. Protein expression and secretion were performed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) and were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To further enhance protein secretion, the effect of several controllable factors including IPTG, Triton X-100, Sucrose, and Glycine were individually investigated at first. In the next step, according to fractional factorial approach, the synergistic effect of IPTG, Triton X-100, and Glycine on secretion was further investigated. To ascertain the structure and function of the secreted recombinant proteins, Dynamic light scattering was utilized and confirmed rPF4 tetramerization and heparin-mediated ultra-large complex formation. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy was exploited to determine the rPF4 secondary structure.\n\nResultsType II secretory pathway was proven to be superior over type I in case of rPF4 secretion into the extracellular milieu. Protein secretion mediated by Type II was enhanced to approximately more than 700 g/ml. Large quantities of native rPF4 up to 20 mg was purified upon a minor scale up to 40 ml of culture medium. Dynamic light scattering unveiled native rPF4 quaternary structure revealing the formation of tetramers having an average size of 10 nm and formation of larger complexes of approximately 100-1200 nm in size following heparin supplementation, implying proper protein folding, tetramerization, and antigenicity. Analysis of the Zeta potential on approximately 600 g/ml of rPF4 revealed a 98 mV positive charge which further confirms protein folding. Moreover, rPF4 secondary structure was determined to be 43.5% Random coil, 32.5% {beta}-sheet, 18.6 % -helix and 4.9 % Turn, which is in perfect agreement with the native structure.\n\nConclusionour results indicate that the gram-negative type II bacterial secretory system holds a great promise to be employed as a reliable protein production strategy with favorable industrial application. However, further efforts are required to realize the full potential of secretory pathways regarding their application to proteins with distinct characteristics.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/830851v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd47fdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8163c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bcbb5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b145d5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract.\n\nrPF4 secretion mediated by type 2 secretory system.

    "abstract": "Many models of evolution are implicitly causal processes. Features such as causal feedback between evolutionary variables and evolutionary processes acting at multiple levels, though, mean that conventional causal models miss important phenomena. We develop here a general theoretical framework for analyzing evolutionary processes drawing on recent approaches to causal modeling developed in the machine-learning literature, which have extended Pearls  do-calculus to incorporate cyclic causal interactions and multilevel causation. We also develop information-theoretic notions necessary to analyze causal information dynamics in our framework, introducing a causal generalization of the Partial Information Decomposition framework. We show how our causal framework helps to clarify conceptual issues in the contexts of complex trait analysis and cancer genetics, including assigning variation in an observed trait to genetic, epigenetic and environmental sources in the presence of epigenetic and environmental feedback processes, and variation in fitness to mutation processes in cancer using a multilevel causal model respectively, as well as relating causally-induced to observed variation in these variables via information theoretic bounds. In the process, we introduce a general class of multilevel causal evolutionary processes which connect evolutionary processes at multiple levels via coarse-graining relationships. Further, we show how a range of  fitness models can be formulated in our framework, as well as a causal analog of Prices equation (generalizing the probabilistic  Rice equation), clarifying the relationships between realized/probabilistic fitness and direct/indirect selection. Finally, we consider the potential relevance of our framework to foundational issues in biology and evolution, including supervenience, multilevel selection and individuality. Particularly, we argue that our class of multilevel causal evolutionary processes, in conjunction with a minimum description length principle, provides a conceptual framework in which identification of multiple levels of selection may be reduced to a model selection problem.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsBananas (Musa spp.) are a major staple food for hundreds of millions of people in developing countries. The cultivated varieties are seedless and parthenocarpic clones of which the ancestral origin remains to be clarified. The most important cultivars are triploids with an AAA, AAB, or ABB genome constitution, with A and B genomes provided by M. acuminata and M. balbisiana, respectively. Previous studies suggested that inter-genome recombinations were relatively common in banana cultivars and that triploids were more likely to have passed through an intermediate hybrid. In this study, we investigated the chromosome structure within the ABB group, composed of starchy cooking bananas that play an important role in food security.\\n\\nMethodsUsing SNP markers called from RAD-Seq data, we studied the chromosome structure of 36 ABB genotypes spanning defined taxonomic subgroups. To complement our understanding, we search for similar events within nine AB hybrid genotypes.\\n\\nKey ResultsRecurrent Homoeologous Exchanges (HEs), i.e. chromatin exchanges between A and B subgenomes were unraveled with at least 9 founding events at the origin of the ABB bananas prior to the clonal diversification. The discovery of this nine founding events allows discussing the possible routes that led to the creation of the different subgroups and formulate new hypotheses. Based on our observations, we suggest different routes that gave rise to the current diversity in the ABB cultivars. Routes involving primary AB hybrids, routes leading to shared HEs and routes leading to a B excess ratio. Genetic fluxes took place between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana, particularly in India, where these unbalanced AB hybrids and ABB allotriploid originated and where cultivated M. balbisiana are abundant.\\n\\nConclusionsThe result of this study clarifies the classification of ABB cultivars and leading possibly to the revision of the classification of this subgroup. This is an important step to unravel the origin of polyploid bananas, and contributes to possible scenarios on the origin. ABB bananas are hypothesized to be more drought tolerant. Knowing the origin of our current cultivars and so their potential parents will help breeders to make the right choices for future crosses. The M. balbisiana genome is a good source to create new cultivars able to answer the numerous challenges of banana breeding.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEstrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer is often effectively treated with drugs that inhibit ER signaling, i.e., tamoxifen (TAM) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). However, about 30% of ER+ breast cancer patients develop resistance to therapy leading to tumour recurrence. Changes in the methylation profile have been implicated as one of the mechanisms through which therapy resistance develops. Therefore, we aimed to identify methylation loci associated with endocrine therapy resistance.\n\nMethodsWe used genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of primary ER+ tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas in combination with curated data on survival and treatment to predict development of endocrine resistance. Association of individual DNA methylation markers with survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models in a cohort of ER+/HER2- tumours (N=552) and two sub-cohorts corresponding to the endocrine treatment (AIs or TAM) that patients received (N=210 and N=172, respectively). Models were adjusted for clinical variables tumour stage, age, AI treatment and luminal subtype. We also identified signatures of multiple methylation loci associated with survival using Cox proportional hazards models with elastic net regularization. Individual markers and multivariable signatures were compared with DNA methylation profiles generated in a time course experiment using the T47D ER+ breast cancer cell line treated with tamoxifen or deprived from estrogen.\n\nResultsWe identified 132, 9 and 1 CpGs for which DNA methylation is significantly associated with survival in the ER+/HER2-, TAM and AI cohorts respectively. Corresponding multi-locus signatures consisted of 171, 50 and 160 CpGs and showed a large overlap with the corresponding single-locus signatures. Single-locus signatures for the ER+/HER2- and TAM cohorts were conserved among the loci that were differentially methylated in endocrine-resistant T47D cells. Similarly, multi-locus signatures for the ER+/HER2- and AI cohorts were conserved in endocrine-resistant T47D cells.\n\nConclusionsWe identified individual and multivariable DNA methylation markers associated with therapy resistance independently of luminal status. Our results suggest that these markers identified from primary tumours and prior to any endocrine treatment are associated with development of endocrine resistance.",

To by-pass this problem, we inferred the genetic basis of the loss of self-incompatibility by intercrossing plants from twelve geographically interspersed outcrossing and selfing populations of North-American Arabidopsis lyrata and determining the breeding system of 1,580 progeny. Self-incompatibility was not restored after crosses between different self-compatible populations. Equal frequencies of self-compatible and self-incompatible progeny emerged from crosses between parents with different breeding systems. We propose a two-locus genetic model for the loss of self-incompatibility in which specific S-locus haplotypes (S1 and S19) are associated with loss of self-incompatibility through their interaction with an unlinked modifier.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use is of increasing public health interest globally. Here we examined the effect of cannabis use, with and without tobacco, on genome-wide DNA methylation in a longitudinal birth cohort (Christchurch Health and Development Study). We found the most differentially methylated sites in cannabis with tobacco users were in the AHRR and F2RL3 genes, replicating previous studies on the effects of tobacco. Cannabis-only users had no evidence of differential methylation in these genes, or at any other loci at the epigenomewide significance level (P<10-7). However, there were 521 sites differentially methylated at P<0.001 which were enriched for genes involved in cardiomyopathy and neuronal signalling. Further, the most differentially methylated loci were associated with genes with reported roles in brain function (e.g. TMEM190, MUC3L, CDC20 and SP9). We conclude that the effects of cannabis use on the mature human blood methylome differ from, and are less pronounced than, the effects of tobacco use, and that larger sample sizes are required to investigate this further.",

    "abstract": "While humans and other animals exhibit adaptation to odorants, the neural mechanisms involved in this process are incompletely understood. One possibility is that it primarily occurs as a result of the interactions between odorants and odorant receptors expressed on the olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. In this scenario, adaptation would arise as a peripheral phenomenon transmitted into the brain. An alternative possibility is that adaptation occurs as a result of processing in the brain. Here we asked whether the olfactory bulb, the first stage of olfactory information processing in the brain, is involved in perceptual adaptation. Multicolor imaging was used to simultaneously measure the olfactory receptor nerve terminals (input) and mitral/tufted cell apical dendrites (output) that innervate the olfactory bulb glomerular layer. Repeated odor stimulation of the same concentration resulted in a decline in the output maps, while the input remained relatively stable. The results indicate that the mammalian olfactory bulb participates in olfactory adaptation.",

To avoid excessive inflammatory response, the Nlrp3 inflammasome has to be precisely controlled. In this study, we show that the mouse mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (Mul1) suppresses Nlrp3 inflammasome activation through ubiquitination and degradation of Asc. In J774A.1 cells, Mul1 overexpression attenuated Nlrp3 activation, whereas Mul1 knockdown augmented Nlrp3 activation in terms of IL-1{beta} secretion and cleavage of pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1{beta}. Mul1 interacted with Asc, and ubiquitinated it at K21, K22, K26, and K55 residues, in a K48-linked manner, leading to proteasomal degradation. Convincingly, Mul1-mediated suppression of Nlrp3 activation was inhibited by K21R-, K22R-, K26R-, K52R-Asc mutants in RAW264.7 cells, when compared with the wild-type Asc. Furthermore, Aim2 inflammasome activation was also inhibited by Mul1 in the wild-type Asc-, but not in mutant Asc-expressing RAW264.7 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Mul1 suppresses Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, through Asc ubiquitination and degradation.",

It is more precise and can lesion deeper in tissue than a solid-state nanosecond laser.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies explain a fraction of the underlying heritability of genetic diseases. Investigating epistatic interactions between two or more loci help closing this gap. Unfortunately, sheer number of loci combinations to process and hypotheses to test prohibit the process both computationally and statistically. Epistasis test prioritization algorithms rank likely-epistatic SNP pairs to limit the number of tests. Yet, they still suffer from very low precision. It was shown in the literature that selecting SNPs that are individually correlated with the phenotype and also diverse with respect to genomic location, leads to better phenotype prediction due to genetic complementation. Here, we propose that an algorithm that pairs SNPs from such diverse regions and ranks them can improve prediction power. We propose an epistasis test prioritization algorithm which optimizes a submodular set function to select a diverse and complementary set of genomic regions that span the underlying genome. SNP pairs from these regions are then further ranked w.r.t. their co-coverage of the case cohort. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art on three GWAS and show that (i) we substantially improve precision (from 0.003 to 0.652) while maintaining the significance of selected pairs, (ii) decrease the number of tests by 25 folds, and (iii) decrease the runtime by 4 folds. We also show that promoting SNPs from regulatory/coding regions improves the performance (up to 0.8). Potpourri is available at http:/ciceklab.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/potpourri.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of peptide binding affinity to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins has the potential to design better therapeutic vaccines. Previous work has shown that pan-specific prediction algorithms can achieve better prediction performance than other approaches. However, most of the top algorithms are neural networks based black box models. Here, we propose DeepAttentionPan, an improved pan-specific model, based on convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms for more flexible, stable and interpretable MHC-I binding prediction. With the attention mechanism, our ensemble model consisting of 20 trained networks achieves high and more stabilized prediction performance. Extensive tests on IEDBs weekly benchmark dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance on 21 test allele datasets. Analysis of the peptide positional attention weights learned by our model demonstrates its capability to capture critical binding positions of the peptides, which leads to mechanistic understanding of MHC-peptide binding with high alignment with experimentally verified results. Furthermore, we show that with transfer learning, our pan model can be fine-tuned for alleles with few samples to achieve additional performance improvement. DeepAttentionPan is freely available as an open source software at https://github.com/jjin49/DeepAttentionPan.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins are classes of proteins that are responsible for immune system regulation in humans. The peptides are short chains of amino acids. HLA class I group present peptides from inside the cell to the cell surface for scrutiny by T cell receptors. For instance, if the cell is infected by a virus, the HLA system will bind to the peptides derived from viral proteins and bring them to the surface of the cell so that the cell can be destroyed by the immune system. Since the HLA genes exhibit extensive polymorphism, there are many HLA alleles binding to different peptides. And this diversity represents challenges in predicting binders for different HLA alleles, which are important in vaccine designs and characterization of immune responses. Before computational algorithms are used to predict the binding relationships of HLA-peptide pairs, scientists need to conduct costly biological experiments to do preliminary screening among a number of peptides and need to use mutant experiments to identify key peptide positions that contribute to the binding. While previous computational methods have been proposed to predict the binding affinity, identifying the binding anchors is not well addressed. Here we developed a deep neural network models with the attention mechanism to learn the binding relationships automatically in an end-to-end way. Our models are able to identify the important binding positions of the peptide sequence by learning the positional importance distribution, which used to be studied a lot only through costly experimental methods. Our model thus not only improves the performance of binding affinity prediction but also allows us to gain biological insight of binding motifs of different alleles via interpreting the learned deep neural network models.",

    "abstract": "Power line interference (\\\"hum noise\\\") is a common source of noise in recorded biological data. It has a highly constant frequency with harmonics and little variation in amplitude and wave shape. In contrast to stochastic noise it is phasic, i.e., the phase relation remains constant across long intervals. In digital recordings, the measurement frequency is typically very close to a multiple of the hum frequency (50 or 60 Hz). Common filters introduce various kinds of distortions and errors. The here proposed subtraction method makes use of the specific properties of power line hum. For this, it computes a moving estimate of the hum noise by taking the periodic median of the high-pass filtered signal. The resulting periodic median subtraction (PMS) filter reliably removes hum of any harmonic composition, even if the ground frequency is lacking. The filter is completely free of border artifacts. It does not introduce distortions, even if around sharp transients such as in force plate recordings of jumping. The filter is validated on recorded and artificial data. The errors are quantified. The results also show that the errors of hum filters generally increase with the high-frequency content of the data. Thus, the removal of hum from a force plate recording generally gives better results than from an EMG recoding. Compared to other filters, the errors of the PMS filter are generally lower than the best hum filters currently known.",

In the mouse model of APAP-induced liver injury (AILI), the administration of recombinant human interleukin 11 (rhIL11) is protective. Here we show that the beneficial effect of rhIL11 in the mouse is due to its unexpected and paradoxical inhibition of endogenous mouse IL11 activity. Contrary to the accepted paradigm IL11 is a potent hepatotoxin across species, which is secreted from damaged hepatocytes to drive an autocrine loop of NOX4 and JNK-dependent apoptosis. Mice with hepatocyte-specific Il11 expression spontaneously develop liver failure whereas those with Il11ra1 deletion are remarkably protected from AILI. Neutralizing anti-IL11R antibodies administered to moribund mice 10 hours following a lethal APAP overdose results in 90% survival that is associated with very large liver regeneration. Our data overturn a misconception, identify a new disease mechanism and suggest IL11 as a therapeutic target for liver regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical systems that express certain chemical species of interest at the same level at any positive equilibrium are called \"absolute concentration robust\" (ACR). These species behave in a stable, predictable way, in the sense that their expression is robust with respect to sudden changes in the species concentration, regardless the new positive equilibrium reached by the system. Such a property has been proven to be fundamentally important in certain gene regulatory networks and signaling systems. In the present paper, we mathematically prove that a well-known class of ACR systems studied by Shinar and Feinberg in 2010 hides an internal integral structure. This structure confers these systems with a higher degree of robustness that what was previously unknown. In particular, disturbances much more general than sudden changes in the species concentrations can be rejected, and robust perfect adaptation is achieved. Significantly, we show that these properties are maintained when the system is interconnected with other chemical reaction networks. This key feature enables design of insulator devices that are able to buffer the loading effect from downstream systems - a crucial requirement for modular circuit design in synthetic biology.",

Among the media that transmit signals between cells, the exosomes secreted by tumor cells mediate information transmission between tumor cells, which can make sensitive cells obtain resistance. Although some cellular exosomes play an important role in tumors acquired drug resistance, the related action mechanism is still not explored specifically.\\n\\nMethodsTo elucidate this process, we constructed a cisplatin-resistant esophageal cancer cell line, and proved that exosomes conferring cellular resistance in esophageal cancer can promote cisplatin resistance in sensitive cells. Through high-throughput sequencing analysis of the exosome and of cells after stimulation by exosomes, we determined that the miRNA193 in exosomes conferring cellular resistance played a key role in sensitive cells acquiring resistance to cisplatin. In vitro experiments showed that miRNA193 can regulate the cell cycle of esophageal cancer cells and inhibit apoptosis, so that sensitive cells can acquire resistance to cisplatin. An in vivo experiment proved that miRNA193 can promote tumor proliferation through the exosomes, and provide sensitive cells with slight resistance to cisplatin.\\n\\nResultsSmall RNA sequencing of exosomes showed that exosomes in drug-resistant cells have 189 up-regulated and 304 down-regulated miRNAs; transcriptome results showed that drug-resistant cells treated with drug-resistant cellular exosomes have 3446 high-expression and 1709 low-expression genes; correlation analysis showed that drug-resistant cellular exosomes mainly affect the drug resistance of sensitive cells through paths such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and the VEGF and Jak-STAT signaling pathways; miRNA193, one of the high-expression miRNAs in drug-resistant cellular exosomes, can promote drug resistance by removing cisplatins inhibition of the cell cycle of sensitive cells.\\n\\nConclusionSensitive cells can become resistant to cisplatin through acquired drug-resistant cellular exosomes, and miRNA193 can make tumor cells acquire cisplatin resistance by regulating the cell cycle.",

We found that infection likelihood correlates with mosquito sporozoite load and, to a lesser degree, the duration of probing, and is not dependent upon the mosquitos ability to find blood. The relationship between sporozoite load and infection probability is non-linear and can be described by a set of models that include a threshold, with mosquitoes harboring over 10,000 salivary gland sporozoites being 7.5 times more likely to initiate a malaria infection. Overall, our data suggest that the small subset of highly infected mosquitoes may contribute disproportionally to malaria transmission in the field and that quantifying mosquito sporozoite loads could aid in predicting the force of infection in different transmission settings.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMalaria is a leading cause of death in many parts of the world. Infection is initiated when infected Anopheles mosquitoes inject sporozoites as they look for blood. Though transmission is a bottleneck for the parasite and thus a good point for intervention, many aspects of transmission remain poorly understood. In this study, using a rodent model of malaria, we found that less than 20% of infectious bites result in disease, demonstrating that the majority of infective bites do not result in malaria infection. Furthermore, we found that the bites of mosquitoes with heavy parasite burdens are 7.5 times more likely to result in disease. These data have important implications for designing interventions targeting transmission stages of the malaria parasite as they suggest that reducing parasite loads, even without completely eliminating them, could be effective against disease spread. We also found that mosquitoes that probe but do not succeed in finding blood are equally likely to initiate infection, an important finding for human vaccine trials. Together, this work adds to our understanding of malaria transmission dynamics and our capacity to develop malaria elimination strategies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDAcute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging virus globally associated with diarrhea. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prevalence of HBoV genotypes in children ([&le;]5 years) from rural communities in South Africa (SA) suffering from AGE.\\n\\nMATERIAL AND METHODA total of 141 fecal samples of children [&le;]5 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were collected from rural Primary Health Care facilities in the Vhembe district of SA between June 2017 and July 2018. Clinical symptoms and demographic data were also recorded. A total of 102 (72%) were outpatients and 39 (28%) were hospitalized patients. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) genotypes were determined using Real-Time Multiplex PCR. DNA extracts of positive samples were confirmed by conventional PCR targeting the NS1 gene. Co-infection with other enteric viruses were determined in HBoV positive samples using Real-Time PCR.\\n\\nRESULTSHBoV was detected in 8 (5.7%) children with AGE. Children were in the age group between 1-24 months. HBoV1 and HBoV3 genotypes were each detected in 3 (37.5%) stool samples and HBoV2 in 2 (25%) stool samples. Co-infection with other enteric viruses included Rotavirus (37.5%); Adenovirus (37.5%); Norovirus (25%) and Astrovirus (12.5%).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONHBoV infections could be seen as a potential emerging diarrheal pathogen in South Africa. Further studies are required to understand the role of HBoV infections in children and adults with acute gastroenteritis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAcute gastroenteritis (AGE) is recognized as a major cause for mortality in children [&le;]5 years of age in Africa and other developing countries. Viruses known to be involved in AGE includes Rotavirus, Norovirus, Astrovirus and Adenovirus and have been reported globally. Recently the Human Bocavirus (HBoV) have been reported in numerous studies globally as a potential cause of diarrhea. In this study, the prevalence and genetic diversity of human Bocavirus in children with AGE from rural communities in Limpopo, South Africa were investigated. In total, 141 stool samples from children [&le;] 5 years with AGE were assessed for the presence of HBoV using Real-Time PCR. HBoV were detected in 8 (5.7%) patients and included 3 positive samples for HBoV1 and HBoV3 respectively and 2 positive for HBoV2. No HBoV4 were detected. Among the 8 positive HBoV samples, co-infection with other enteric viruses were found in 7 (87.5%) samples, while mono infection with HBoV alone was detected in 1 (12.5%) patient. HBoV mixed infection with Rotavirus (3/8; 37.5%); Adenovirus (3/8; 37.5%); Norovirus (2/8; 25%) and Astrovirus (1/8; 12.5%) were observed in this study. This study reported for the first time on the prevalence of human Bocavirus in children with AGE from rural communities in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic gene expression in neurons shapes fundamental processes of the nervous systems of animals. But how different stimuli that activate the same neuron can lead to distinct transcriptional responses remains unclear. We have been studying how microbial metabolites modulate gene expression in chemosensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. Considering the diverse environmental stimuli that can activate chemosensory neurons of C. elegans, we have sought to understand how specific transcriptional responses can be generated in these neurons in response to distinct cues. We have focused on the mechanism of rapid (<6 min) and selective transcriptional induction of daf-7, a gene encoding a TGF-{beta} ligand that promotes bacterial lawn avoidance, in the ASJ chemosensory neurons in response to the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we define the involvement of two distinct cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent pathways that are required for daf-7 expression in the ASJ neuron pair in response to P. aeruginosa. We show that a calcium-independent pathway dependent on the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) EGL-4, and a canonical calcium-dependent signaling pathway dependent on the activity of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit CNG-2, function in parallel to activate rapid, selective transcription of daf-7 in response to P. aeruginosa metabolites. Our data suggest a requirement for PKG in promoting the fast, selective early transcription of neuronal genes in shaping responses to distinct microbial stimuli in a pair of chemosensory neurons of C. elegans.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe nervous systems of animals carry out the crucial roles of sensing and interpreting the external environment. When the free-living microscopic roundworm C. elegans is exposed to the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensory neurons detect metabolites produced by the pathogen and induce expression of the gene for a neuroendocrine ligand called DAF-7. In turn, activity of DAF-7 is required for the full avoidance response to the P. aeruginosa, allowing the animals to reduce bacterial load and survive longer. Here, we systematically dissect the molecular pathway between the sensation of P. aeruginosa metabolites and the expression of daf-7 in a pair of C. elegans sensory neurons. We show that the intracellular signaling molecule cyclic GMP is a key signaling intermediate. In addition, we show that there are calcium-dependent and calcium-independent pathways that are both required to engage daf-7 expression, highlighting an organizational principle that allows neurons to distinguish between various stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Grain hardness is an important quality trait of cereal crops. In wheat, it is mainly determined by the Hardness locus that harbors genes encoding puroindoline A (PINA) and puroindoline B (PINB). Any deletion or mutation of these genes leading to the absence of PINA or to single amino acid changes in PINB leads to hard endosperms. Although it is generally acknowledged that hardness is controlled by adhesion strength between the protein matrix and starch granules, the physicochemical mechanisms connecting puroindolines and the starch-protein interactions are unknown as of this time. To explore these mechanisms, we focused on PINA. The overexpression in a hard wheat cultivar (cv. Courtot with the Pina-D1a and Pinb-D1d alleles) decreased grain hardness in a dose-related effect, suggesting an interactive process. When PINA was added to gliadins in solution, large aggregates of up to 13 {micro}m in diameter were formed. Turbidimetry measurements showed that the PINA-gliadin interaction displayed a high cooperativity that increased with a decrease in pH from neutral to acid (pH 4) media, mimicking the pH change during endosperm development. No turbidity was observed in the presence of isolated - and {gamma}-gliadins, but non-cooperative interactions of PINA with these proteins could be confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. A significant higher interaction of PINA with {gamma}-gliadins than with -gliadins was observed. Similar binding behavior was observed with a recombinant repeated polypeptide that mimics the repeat domain of gliadins, i.e., (Pro-Gln-Gln-Pro-Tyr)8. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of PINA with a monomeric gliadin creates a nucleation point leading to the aggregation of other gliadins, a phenomenon that could prevent further interaction of the storage prolamins with starch granules. Consequently, the role of puroindoline-prolamin interactions on grain hardness should be addressed on the basis of previous observations that highlight the similar subcellular routing of storage prolamins and puroindolines.",

    "abstract": "Coordination of fate transition and cell division is crucial to maintain the plant architecture and to achieve efficient production of plant organs. In this paper, we analysed the stem cell dynamics at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) that is one of the plant stem cells locations. We designed a mathematical model to elucidate the impact of hormonal signaling on the fate transition rates between different zones corresponding to slowly dividing stem cells and fast dividing transit amplifying cells. The model is based on a simplified two-dimensional disc geometry of the SAM and accounts for a continuous displacement towards the periphery of cells produced in the central zone. Coupling growth and hormonal signaling results in a non-linear system of reaction-diffusion equations on a growing domain with the growth velocity depending on the model components. The model is tested by simulating perturbations in the level of key transcription factors that maintain SAM homeostasis. The model provides new insights on how the transcription factor HECATE is integrated in the regulatory network that governs stem cell differentiation.\n\nSummaryPlants continuously generate new organs such as leaves, roots and flowers. This process is driven by stem cells which are located in specialized regions, so-called meristems. Dividing stem cells give rise to offspring that, during a process referred to as cell fate transition, become more specialized and give rise to organs. Plant architecture and crop yield crucially depend on the regulation of meristem dynamics. To better understand this regulation, we develop a computational model of the shoot meristem. The model describes the meristem as a two-dimensional disk that can grow and shrink over time, depending on the concentrations of the signalling factors in its interior. This allows studying how the non-linear interaction of multiple transcription factors is linked to cell division and fate-transition. We test the model by simulating perturbations of meristem signals and comparing them to experimental data. The model allows simulating different hypotheses about signal effects. Based on the model we study the specific role of the transcription factor HECATE and provide new insights in its action on cell dynamics and in its interrelation with other known transcription factors in the meristem.",

    "abstract": "TYK2 belongs to the JAK protein tyrosine kinase family and mediates signaling of numerous antiviral and immunoregulatory cytokines (type I and type III IFNs, IL-10, IL-12, IL-22, IL-23) in immune and non-immune cells. After many years of genetic association studies, TYK2 is recognized as a susceptibility gene for some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (AID). Seven TYK2 variants have been associated with AIDs in Europeans, and establishing their causality remains challenging. Previous work showed that a protective variant (P1104A) is hypomorphic and also a risk allele for mycobacterial infection. Here, we have studied two AID-associated common TYK2 variants: rs12720270 located in intron 7 and rs2304256, a non-synonymous variant in exon 8 that causes a valine to phenylalanine substitution (c.1084 G > T, Val362Phe). We found that this amino acid substitution does not alter TYK2 expression, catalytic activity or ability to relay signaling in EBV-B cell lines or in reconstituted TYK2-null cells. Based on in silico predictions that these variants may impact splicing of exon 8, we: i) analyzed TYK2 transcripts in genotyped EBV-B cells and in CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells, ii) measured splicing using minigene assays, and iii) performed eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) analysis of TYK2 transcripts in primary monocytes and whole blood cells. Our results reveal that the two variants promote the inclusion of exon 8, which, we demonstrate, is essential for TYK2 binding to cognate receptors. In addition and in line with GTEx (Genetic Tissue Expression) data, our eQTL results show that rs2304256 mildly enhances TYK2 expression in whole blood. In all, these findings suggest that these TYK2 variants are not neutral but instead have a potential impact in AID.",

    "abstract": "NME23/NDPK proteins are well conserved proteins found in all living organism. Besides their catalytic activity of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) they are considered multifunctional, which were first characterized as non-metastatic proteins in mammalian cells. Later, increasing evidences placed NME/NDPK as proteins involved in DNA stability such as gene regulation and DNA-repair. TcNDPK1 is the canonical NDPK isoform present in the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, orthologous to NME23-H1/H2 which has been shown to have in vitro nuclease activity and DNA-binding properties. In the present study we investigate the role of TcNDPK1 in DNA-damage responses using heterologous gene expression systems and over-expression in epimastigote cells. We found that different strains of bacteria, WT and ndk-mutants, expressing the enzyme decreased about 5 fold and 18 fold the spontaneous mutation rate, respectively. In addition, yeasts lacking the endogenous gene YNK1 (YNK1-) and expressing TcNDPK1, were significantly more resistant to different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and were less sensible to UV radiation than controls. Parasites over-expressing TcNDPK1 were able to withstand different genotoxic stresses caused by hydrogen peroxide, phleomycin and hidroxyurea. In addition, under oxidative damage, TcNDPK1 over-expressing parasites presented lesser genomic damage and augmented levels of poly(ADP)ribose and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, an enzyme involved in DNA repair. These results strongly suggest that TcNDPK1 is involved in the maintenance of parasite genomic-DNA integrity, thus, giving rise to a novel function.",
