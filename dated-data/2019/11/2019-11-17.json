    "abstract": "Blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction upon ischemia and hypoxia has been implicated in the exacerbation of neuronal injury in stroke. Despite the therapeutic potential of the cerebrovascular endothelium, the limited understanding of the endothelial signaling pathways governing BBB function restricts progress towards developing novel therapeutic approaches specifically targeting the endothelium. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent modulator of endothelial function via its receptors (S1PR). Recent human and mouse studies indicate that vasoprotective endothelial S1P signaling via S1PR1 may be impaired in cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Herein, we investigated the expression of S1PR1 in the mouse and human cerebrovascular endothelium and the role of endothelial-specific S1PR1 signaling in brain injury in a mouse model of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the most devastating type of stroke. We found that S1PR1 is the most abundant S1PR transcript in the mouse brain and in mouse and human brain endothelial cells (20-100 mRNA copies per cell). S1PR1 transcripts were significantly enriched (~6 fold) in mouse cortical microvessels compared to total brain. Using the S1PR1-eGFP knock in mouse, we found that S1PR1-eGFP is abundantly expressed in the cerebrovascular endothelium in the mouse brain. A similar pattern of expression was observed in human brain samples. Endothelial specific deletion of S1PR1 in adult mice (S1pr1 flox/floxxCdh5-CreERT2, referred to as S1pr1iECKO), resulted in exacerbation of brain edema, neuronal injury and worsened neurological outcomes upon SAH compared to S1pr1 flox/flox littermates. No differences in the subarachnoid blood, hemostasis or cerebral blood flow changes during and after SAH were found between groups. Mechanistically, S1pr1iECKO exhibited aggravated BBB dysfunction and increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) in isolated cortical microvessels, a downstream effector of the Rho-ROCK pathway implicated in endothelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Taken together, our data indicate that S1PR1 is an endogenous protective signaling pathway in the endothelium, critical to maintain BBB function and to mitigate neuronal injury in pathological conditions. Thus, the therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway in stroke deserves further study.",

    "abstract": "New cellular functions and developmental processes can evolve by modifying existing genes or creating novel genes. Novel genes can arise not only via duplication or mutation but also by acquiring foreign DNA, also called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here we show that HGT likely contributed to the creation of a novel gene indispensable for reproduction in some insects. Long considered a novel gene with unknown origin, oskar has evolved to fulfil a crucial role in insect germ cell formation. Our analysis of over 100 insect Oskar sequences suggests that Oskar arose de novo via fusion of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences. This work shows that highly unusual gene origin processes can give rise to novel genes that can facilitate evolution of novel developmental mechanisms.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryOur research shows that gene origin processes often considered highly unusual, including HGT and de novo coding region evolution, can give rise to novel genes that can both participate in pre-existing gene regulatory networks, and also facilitate the evolution of novel developmental mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeThe extra-medical use of, and addiction to, prescription opioid analgesics is a growing health problem. To characterize how prescription opioid abuse develops, this study investigated the affective consequences of escalating prescription opioid use using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) reward and oxycodone intravenous self-administration (IVSA) models.\n\nExperimental ApproachMale Wistar rats were given access to oxycodone IVSA (0.15 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) in Short Access (ShA; 1 h) or Long Access (LgA; 12 h) sessions for 5 sessions/week followed by intermittent 60 h discontinuations from drug access, a novel explicit test of the negative reinforcement hypothesis. Separate groups were first trained in the ICSS procedure and then in oxycodone IVSA in 11 h LgA sessions.\n\nKey ResultsRats given LgA to oxycodone escalated their responding more than ShA rats, with further significant increases observed following each 60 h discontinuation. Pre-session brain reward thresholds increased with sequential daily LgA IVSA sessions, consistent with a growing negative affective state consequent to successive daily intoxication/abstinence cycles. A 1 h oxycodone IVSA interval was sufficient to normalize these elevated reward thresholds, as was, paradoxically, a 60 h weekend abstinence. The increase in ICSS thresholds was attenuated in a group treated with the long-acting kappa opioid antagonist norBNI prior to IVSA training.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsChanges in brain reward function during escalation of oxycodone self-administration are driven by an interplay between kappa opioid receptor-mediated negative affective state associated with escalated oxycodone intake and dynamic restoration of brain reward status during longer periods of abstinence.",

    "abstract": "The ability to move fast and accurately track moving objects is fundamentally constrained by the biophysics of neurons and dynamics of the muscles involved. Yet, the corresponding tradeoffs between these factors and tracking motor commands have not been rigorously quantified. We use feedback control principles to quantify performance limitations of the sensorimotor control system (SCS) to track fast periodic movements. We show that (i) linear models of the SCS fail to predict known undesirable phenomena, including skipped cycles, overshoot and undershoot, produced when tracking signals in the \"fast regime\", while non-linear pulsatile control models can predict such undesirable phenomena, and (ii) tools from nonlinear control theory allow us to characterize fundamental limitations in this fast regime. Using a validated and tractable nonlinear model of the SCS, we derive an analytical upper bound on frequencies that the SCS model can reliably track before producing such undesirable phenomena as a function of the neurons biophysical constraints and muscle dynamics. The performance limitations derived here have important implications in sensorimotor control. For example, if primary motor cortex is compromised due to disease or damage, the theory suggests ways to manipulate muscle dynamics by adding the necessary compensatory forces using an assistive neuroprosthetic device to restore motor performance, and more importantly fast and agile movements. Just how one should compensate can be informed by our SCS model and the theory developed here.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders are highly heritable and associated with spatially-selective disruptions of brain anatomy. The logic that translates genetic risks into spatially patterned brain vulnerabilities remains unclear but is a fundamental question in disease pathogenesis. Here, we approach this question by integrating (i) in vivo neuroimaging data from patient subgroups with known causal genomic copy number variations (CNVs), and (ii) bulk and single-cell gene expression data from healthy cortex. First, for each of six different CNV disorders, we show that spatial patterns of cortical anatomy change in youth are correlated with spatial patterns of expression for CNV region genes in bulk cortical tissue from typically-developing adults. Next, by transforming normative bulk-tissue cortical expression data into cell-type expression maps, we further link each disorders anatomical change map to specific cell classes and specific CNV-region genes that these cells express. Finally, we establish convergent validity of this \"transcriptional vulnerability model\" by inter-relating patient neuroimaging data with measures of altered gene expression in both brain and blood-derived patient tissue. Our work clarifies general biological principles that govern the mapping of genetic risks onto regional brain disruption in neurodevelopmental disorders. We present new methods that can harness these principles to screen for potential cellular and molecular determinants of disease from readily available patient neuroimaging data.",

Tau is a client of Hsp90, though it is unclear whether and how the chaperone massages the structure of intrinsically disordered Tau. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we extract structural information from the very broad conformational ensemble of Tau: Tau in solution is highly dynamic and polymorphic, though  paper-clip-shaped by long-range contacts. Interaction with Hsp90 promotes an open Tau conformation, which we identify as the molecular basis for the formation of small Tau oligomers by exposure of the aggregation-prone repeat domain to other Tau molecules. At the same time, formation of Tau fibrils is inhibited. We therefore provide the nanometer-scale zoom into chaperoning an amyloid client, highlighting formation of oligomers as the consequence of this biologically relevant interaction.",

    "abstract": "Agonist binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) leads to conformational changes in the transmembrane region that activate cytosolic signaling pathways. Al-though high resolution structures of different receptor states are available, atomistic details of the allosteric signalling across the membrane remain elusive. We calculated free energy landscapes of the {beta}2 adrenergic receptors activation using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in an optimized string of swarms framework, which sheds new light on how microswitches govern the equilibrium between conformational states. Contraction of the extracellular binding site in the presence of the agonist BI-167107 is obligatorily coupled to conformational changes in a connector motif located in the core of the transmembrane region. The connector is probabilistically coupled to the conformation of the intracellular region. An active connector promotes desolvation of a buried cavity, a twist of the conserved NPxxY motif, and an interaction between two conserved tyrosines in transmembrane helices 5 and 7 (Y-Y motif), which leads to a larger population of active-like states at the G protein binding site. This coupling is augmented by protonation of the strongly conserved Asp792.50. The agonist binding site hence communicates with the intracellular region via a cascade of locally connected microswitches. Characterization of these can be used to understand how ligands stabilize distinct receptor states and contribute to development drugs with specific signaling properties. The developed simulation protocol is likely transferable to other class A GPCRs.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/627026v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dfcfb5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bdaf81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14d74e6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35cea9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Regeneration of a limb or tissue can be achieved through multiple different pathways and mechanisms. The sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida has been observed to have excellent regenerative proficiency but this has not yet been described transcriptionally. In this study we examined the genetic expression changes during a regenerative timecourse and report key genes involved in regeneration and wound healing. We found that the major response was an early upregulation of genes involved in cellular movement and cell communication, which likely contribute to a high level of tissue plasticity resulting in the rapid regeneration response observed in this species. We find the immune system is only transcriptionally active in the first eight hours post-amputation and conclude, in accordance with previous literature, that the immune system and regeneration have an inverse relationship. Fifty-nine genes (3.8% of total) differentially expressed during regeneration were identified as having no orthologues in other species, indicating that regeneration in E. pallida may rely on the activation of species-specific novel genes. Additionally, taxonomically-restricted novel genes, including species-specific novels, and highly conserved genes were identified throughout the regenerative timecourse, showing that both may work in concert to achieve complete regeneration. We conclude that E. pallida behaves similarly to other anemone species such as Nematostella vectensis and Calliactis polypus but with some notable novel differences.",

Assemblies cover >95% of the human reference genome, with over 98% in a diploid state. Thus, the assemblies support detection and accurate genotyping of the most prevalent types of human genetic variation, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions and deletions (small indels), and structural variants (SVs), in all but the most difficult regions. All heterozygous variants are phased in blocks that can approach arm-level length. The final output of Aquila is a diploid and phased personal genome sequence, and a phased VCF file that also contains homozygous and a few unphased heterozygous variants. Aquila represents a cost-effective evolution of whole-genome reconstruction that can be applied to cohorts for variation discovery or association studies, or to single individuals with rare phenotypes that could be caused by SVs or compound heterozygosity.",

Likewise, PTSD is a risk factor in the development of AUD, with conflicting data on the impact of sex in the comorbid development of both disorders. Because the likelihood of experiencing more than one traumatic event is high, we aim to utilize chronic repeated predatory stress (CRPS) to query the extent to which sex interacts with CRPS to influence alcohol consumption, or cessation of consumption.\n\nMethodsMale (n=16) and female (n=15) C57BL/6J mice underwent CRPS or daily handling for two weeks during adolescence (P35-P49) and two weeks during adulthood (P65-P79). Following the conclusion of two rounds of repeated stress, behavior was assessed in the open field. Mice subsequently underwent a two-bottle choice intermittent ethanol access (IEA) assessment (P90-131) with the options of 20% ethanol or water. After establishing drinking behavior, increasing concentrations of quinine were added to the ethanol to assess the drinking response to adulteration of the alcohol.\n\nResultsCRPS increased fecal corticosterone concentrations and anxiety-like behaviors in the open field in both male and female mice as compared to control mice that had not been exposed to CRPS. Consistent with previous reports, we observed a sex difference in alcohol consumption such that females consumed more ethanol per gram of body mass than males. In addition, CRPS reduced alcohol aversion in male mice such that higher concentrations of quinine were necessary to reduce alcohol intake as compared to control mice. CRPS did not alter alcohol-related behaviors in female mice.\n\nConclusionCollectively, we demonstrate that repeated CRPS can induce anxiety-like behavior in both sexes but selectively influences the response to ethanol adulteration in males.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of social networks can determine the transmission of information, the spread of diseases, and the evolution of behavior. Despite this broad importance, a general framework for predicting social network stability has not been proposed. Here, we present longitudinal data on the social dynamics of a cooperative bird species, the wire-tailed manakin, to evaluate the potential causes of temporal network stability. We find that when partners interact less frequently, and when the breadth of social connectedness within the network increases, the social network is subsequently less stable. Social connectivity was also negatively associated with the temporal persistence of coalition partnerships on an annual timescale. This negative association between connectivity and stability was surprising, especially given that individual manakins who were more connected also had more stable partnerships. This apparent paradox arises from a within-individual behavioral trade-off between partnership quantity and quality. Crucially, this trade-off is easily masked by behavioral variation among individuals. Using a simulation, we show that these results are explained by a simple model that combines among-individual behavioral heterogeneity and reciprocity within the network. As social networks become more connected, individuals face a trade-off between partnership quantity and maintenance. This model also demonstrates how among-individual behavioral heterogeneity, a ubiquitous feature of natural societies, can improve social stability. Together, these findings provide unifying principles that are expected to govern diverse social systems.\n\nSignificance StatementIn animal societies, social partnerships form a dynamic network that can change over time. Why are some social network structures more stable than others? We addressed this question by studying a cooperative bird species in which social behavior is important for fitness, similar to humans. We found that stable social networks are characterized by more frequent interactions, but sparser connectivity throughout the network. Using a simulation, we show how both results can be explained by a simple model of reciprocity. These findings indicate that social stability is governed by a trade-off whereby individuals can either maintain a few high-quality partners, or increase partner number. This fundamental trade-off may govern the dynamics and stability of many societies, including in humans.",

    "abstract": "We propose an extended Gaussian mixture model for the distribution of causal effects of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for human complex phenotypes that depends on linkage disequilibrium (LD) and heterozygosity (H), while also allowing for independent components for small and large effects. Using a precise methodology showing how genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics (z-scores) arise through LD with underlying causal SNPs, we applied the model to GWAS of multiple human phenotypes. Our findings indicated that causal effects are distributed with dependence on total LD and H, whereby SNPs with lower total LD and H are more likely to be causal with larger effects; this dependence is consistent with models of the influence of negative pressure from natural selection. Compared with the basic Gaussian mixture model it is built on, the extended model - primarily through quantification of selection pressure - reproduces with greater accuracy the empirical distributions of z-scores, thus providing better estimates of genetic quantities, such as polygenicity and heritability, that arise from the distribution of causal effects.",

    "abstract": "Research in the life sciences has traditionally relied on the analysis of clear morphological phenotypes, which are often revealed using increasingly powerful microscopy techniques analyzed as maximum intensity projections (MIPs). However, as biology turns towards the analysis of more subtle phenotypes, MIPs and qualitative approaches are failing to adequately describe these phenotypes. To address these limitations and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional (3D) spatial relationships of biological structures, we developed the computational method and program called {Delta}SCOPE (Changes in Spatial Cylindrical Coordinate Orientation using PCA Examination). Our approach uses the fluorescent signal distribution within a 3D data set and reorients the fluorescent signal to a relative biological reference structure. This approach enables quantification and statistical analysis of spatial relationships and signal density in 3D multichannel signals that are positioned around a well-defined structure contained in a reference channel. We validated the application of {Delta}SCOPE by analyzing normal axon and glial cell guidance in the zebrafish forebrain and by quantifying the commissural phenotypes associated with abnormal Slit guidance cue expression in the forebrain. Despite commissural phenotypes which display disruptions to the reference structure, {Delta}SCOPE was able to detect subtle, previously uncharacterized changes in zebrafish forebrain midline crossing axons and glia. This method has been developed as a user-friendly, open source program. We propose that {Delta}SCOPE is an innovative approach to advancing the state of image quantification in the field of high resolution microscopy, and that the techniques presented here are of broad applications to the life science field.",

    "abstract": "The origins and neural bases of the current opioid addiction epidemic are unclear. Genetics plays a major role in addiction vulnerability, but cannot account for the recent exponential rise in opioid abuse, so environmental factors must contribute. Individuals with history of early-life adversity (ELA) are disproportionately prone to opioid addiction, yet whether ELA interacts with factors such as increased access to opioids to directly influence brain development and function and cause opioid addiction vulnerability is unknown. We simulated ELA in female rats and this led to a striking opioid addiction-like phenotype. This was characterized by resistance to extinction, increased relapse-like behavior, and, as in addicted humans, major increases in opioid economic demand. By contrast, seeking of a less salient natural reward was unaffected by ELA, whereas demand for highly palatable treats was augmented. These discoveries provide novel insights into the origins and nature of reward circuit malfunction that may set the stage for addiction.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe electronic health record is a rising resource for quantifying medical practice, discovering adverse effects of drugs, and studying comparative effectiveness. One of the challenges of applying these methods to health care data is the high dimensionality of the health record. Methods to discover effects of drugs in health data must account for tens of thousands of potentially relevant confounders. Our goal in this work is to reduce the dimensionality of the health data with the aim of accelerating the application of retrospective cohort studies to this data.\n\nMaterials and MethodsHere, we develop indication embeddings, a way to reduce the dimensionality of health data while capturing information relevant to treatment decisions. We evaluate these embeddings using external data on drug indications. Then, we use the embeddings as a substitute for medical history to match patients, and develop evaluation metrics for these matches.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that these embeddings recover therapeutic uses of drugs. We use embeddings as an informative representation of relationships between drugs, between health history events and drug prescriptions, and between patients at a particular time in their health history. We show that using embeddings to match cohorts improves the balance of the cohorts, even in terms of poorly measured risk factors like smoking.\n\nDiscussion and ConclusionUnlike other embeddings inspired by word2vec, indication embeddings are specifically designed to capture the medical history leading to prescription of a new drug. For retrospective cohort studies, our low-dimensional representation helps in finding comparator drugs and constructing comparator cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the neural dynamics underlying sensory processing is one of the central areas of investigation in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Neuroimaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have provided significant insights into the neural processing of continuous stimuli, such as speech, thanks to their high temporal resolution. Existing work in the context of auditory processing suggests that certain features of speech, such as the acoustic envelope, can be used as reliable linear predictors of the neural response manifested in M/EEG. The corresponding linear filters are referred to as temporal response functions (TRFs). While the functional roles of specific components of the TRF are well-studied and linked to behavioral attributes such as attention, the cortical origins of the underlying neural processes are not as well understood. In this work, we address this issue by estimating a linear filter representation of cortical sources directly from neuroimaging data in the context of continuous speech processing. To this end, we introduce Neuro-Current Response Functions (NCRFs), a set of linear filters, spatially distributed throughout the cortex, that predict the cortical currents giving rise to the observed ongoing MEG (or EEG) data in response to continuous speech. NCRF estimation is cast within a Bayesian framework, which allows unification of the TRF and source estimation problems, and also facilitates the incorporation of prior information on the structural properties of the NCRFs. To generalize this analysis to M/EEG recordings which lack individual structural magnetic resonance (MR) scans, NCRFs are extended to free-orientation dipoles and a novel regularizing scheme is put forward to lessen reliance on fine-tuned coordinate co-registration. We present a fast estimation algorithm, which we refer to as the Champ-Lasso algorithm, by leveraging recent advances in optimization, and demonstrate its utility through application to simulated and experimentally recorded MEG data under auditory experiments. Our simulation studies reveal significant improvements over existing methods that typically operate in a two-stage fashion, in terms of spatial resolution, response function reconstruction, and recovering dipole orientations. The analysis of experimentally-recorded MEG data without MR scans corroborates existing findings, but also delineates the distinct cortical distribution of the underlying neural processes at high spatiotemporal resolution. In summary, we provide a principled modeling and estimation paradigm for MEG source analysis tailored to extracting the cortical origin of electrophysiological responses to continuous stimuli.",

Subsequently, we employ the same data to delimit the frontiers of functional coherence along the bacterial phylogeny. Our results show that within-group phylogenetic and gene content similarity of taxa in the same rank are not homogenous, and that these values show extensive overlap between ranks. Functional coherence along the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny was limited to 44 particular nodes presenting large variations in phylogenetic depth. For instance, the deep subtree affiliated to class Actinobacteria presented functional coherence, while the shallower family Enterobacteriaceae-affiliated subtree did not. On the other hand, functional coherence along the genome-based phylogeny delimited deep subtrees affiliated to phyla Actinobacteriota, Deinococcota, Chloroflexota, Firmicutes, and a subtree containing the rest of the bacterial phyla.\n\nIMPORTANCEWhile bacterial taxonomy and phylogeny resources as well as related bioinformatic tools continue to improve, the question remains as to how they should best be employed in studies using 16S rRNA gene surveys to assess bacteria-ecosystem relationships, a widespread approach. The results contained herein lead to the recommendation that all ranks from genus to class/phylum be employed if using taxonomic binning in the analysis of 16S rRNA gene surveys. With regards to the use of phylogeny or clustering-based approaches, single or arbitrary tree topology or sequence distance thresholds should not be employed. Instead, the results presented here can be used to obtain more meaningful results in many microbial ecology and evolution research scenarios. Moreover, we provide dedicated scripts and files that can be used to continue the exploration of functional coherence along the bacterial phylogeny employing different parameters or input data.",

    "abstract": "Having a structural network representation of connectivity in the brain is instrumental in analyzing communication dynamics and information processing in the brain. In this work, we make steps towards understanding multi-sensory information flow and integration using a network diffusion approach. In particular, we model the flow of evoked activity, initiated by stimuli at primary sensory regions, using the Asynchronous Linear Threshold (ALT) diffusion model. The ALT model captures how evoked activity that originates at a given region of the cortex \"ripples through\" other brain regions (referred to as an activation cascade). By comparing the model results to functional datasets based on Voltage Sensitive Dye (VSD) imaging, we find that in most cases the ALT model predicts the temporal ordering of an activation cascade correctly. Our results on the Mouse Connectivity Atlas from the Allen Institute for Brain Science show that a small number of brain regions are involved in many primary sensory streams - the claustrum and the parietal temporal cortex being at the top of the list. This suggests that the cortex relies on an hourglass architecture to first integrate and compress multi-sensory information from multiple sensory regions, before utilizing that lower-dimensionality representation in higher-level association regions and more complex cognitive tasks.",

    "abstract": "Most bacteria surround themselves with a cell wall, a strong meshwork consisting primarily of the polymerized aminosugar peptidoglycan (PG). PG is essential for structural maintenance of bacterial cells, and thus for viability. PG is also constantly synthesized and turned over, the latter process is mediated by PG cleavage enzymes, for example the endopeptidases (EPs). EPs themselves are essential for growth, but also promote lethal cell wall degradation after exposure to antibiotics that inhibit PG synthases (e.g., {beta}-lactams). Thus, EPs are attractive targets for novel antibiotics and their adjuvants. However, we have a poor understanding of how these enzymes are regulated in vivo, depriving us of novel pathways for the development of such antibiotics. Here, we have solved crystal structures of the LysM/M23 family peptidase ShyA, the primary EP of the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Our data suggest that ShyA assumes two drastically different conformations; a more open form that allows for substrate binding, and a closed form, which we predicted to be catalytically inactive. Mutations expected to promote the open conformation caused enhanced activity in vitro and in vivo, and these results were recapitulated in EPs from the divergent pathogens Neisseria gonorrheae and Escherichia coli. Our results suggest that LysM/M23 EPs are regulated via release of the inhibitory Domain1 from the M23 active site, likely through conformational re-arrangement in vivo.\n\nSignificanceBacteria digest their cell wall following exposure to antibiotics like penicillin. The endopeptidases (EPs) are among the proteins that catalyze cell wall digestion processes after antibiotic exposure, but we do not understand how these enzymes are regulated during normal growth. Herein, we present the structure of the major EP from the diarrheal pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Surprisingly, we find that EPs from this and other pathogens appear to be produced as a largely inactive precursor that undergoes a conformational shift exposing the active site to engage in cell wall digestion. These results enhance our understanding of how EPs are regulated and could open the door for the development of novel antibiotics that overactivate cell wall digestion processes.",

    "abstract": "Microbes trapped in permanently frozen paleosoils (permafrost) are the focus of increasing researches in the context of global warming. Our previous investigations led to the discovery and reactivation of two Acanthamoeba-infecting giant viruses, Mollivirus sibericum and Pithovirus sibericum from a 30,000-year old permafrost layer. While several modern pithovirus strains have since been isolated, no contemporary mollivirus relative was found. We now describe Mollivirus kamchatka, a close relative to M. sibericum, isolated from surface soil sampled on the bank of the Kronotsky river in Kamchatka. This discovery confirms that molliviruses have not gone extinct and are at least present in a distant subarctic continental location. This modern isolate exhibits a nucleo-cytoplasmic replication cycle identical to that of M. sibericum. Its spherical particle (0.6-m in diameter) encloses a 648-kb GC-rich double stranded DNA genome coding for 480 proteins of which 61 % are unique to these two molliviruses. The 461 homologous proteins are highly conserved (92 % identical residues in average) despite the presumed stasis of M. sibericum for the last 30,000 years. Selection pressure analyses show that most of these proteins contribute to the virus fitness. The comparison of these first two molliviruses clarify their evolutionary relationship with the pandoraviruses, supporting their provisional classification in a distinct family, the Molliviridae, pending the eventual discovery of intermediary missing links better demonstrating their common ancestry.\n\nImportanceVirology has long been viewed through the prism of human, cattle or plant diseases leading to a largely incomplete picture of the viral world. The serendipitous discovery of the first giant virus visible under light microscopy (i.e., >0.3m in diameter), mimivirus, opened a new era of environmental virology, now incorporating protozoan-infecting viruses. Planet-wide isolation studies and metagenomes analyses have shown the presence of giant viruses in most terrestrial and aquatic environments including upper Pleistocene frozen soils. Those systematic surveys have led authors to propose several new distinct families, including the Mimiviridae, Marseilleviridae, Faustoviridae, Pandoraviridae, and Pithoviridae. We now propose to introduce one additional family, the Molliviridae, following the description of M. kamchatka, the first modern relative of M. sibericum, previously isolated from 30,000-year old arctic permafrost.",

    "abstract": "The current study determined if inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus impairs the retrieval of newly formed context fear memories. This region was silencing by activating inhibitory neurons or by hyperpolarizing pyramidal cells directly. When inhibitory neurons were stimulated with ChR2, memory retrieval was significantly impaired. In contrast, when the same neurons were activated with the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq, retrieval was not affected. This dissociation was not due to differences in inhibition, as both manipulations activated interneurons and reduced excitation throughout the dorsal hippocampus. Therefore, we hypothesize that the retrieval deficit caused by ChR2 stimulation is due to an immediate reduction in hippocampal activity that does not provide enough time for other brain regions to compensate. Stimulation of DREADDs, on the other hand, produces a gradual loss of excitation that takes several minutes to reach asymptote. This appears to be a sufficient amount of time for extra-hippocampal structures to become engaged and express context fear. Implications for theories of hippocampal function, systems consolidation and memory retrieval are discussed.",

This approach utilizes a bioorthogonal, multifunctional chemical probe that can be targeted to a genetically encoded protein of interest (POI) through a modular SNAP-Tag/benzylguanine covalent interaction. A first generation photoproximity probe, PP1, responds to 365 nm light to simultaneously cleave a central nitroveratryl linker and a peripheral diazirine group, resulting in diffusion of a highly reactive carbene nucleophile away from the POI. We demonstrate facile probe loading, and subsequent interaction- and light-dependent proximal labeling of a model protein-protein interaction (PPI) in vitro. Integration of the PhotoPPI workflow with quantitative LC-MS/MS enabled un-biased interaction mapping for the redox regulated sensor protein, KEAP1, for the first time in live cells. We validated known and novel interactions between KEAP1 and the proteins PGAM5 and HK2, among others, under basal cellular conditions. By contrast, comparison of PhotoPPI profiles in cells experiencing metabolic or redox stress confirmed that KEAP1 sheds many basal interactions and becomes associated with known lysosomal trafficking and proteolytic proteins like SQSTM1, CTSD and LGMN. Together, these data establish PhotoPPI as a method capable of tracking the dynamic sub-cellular and protein interaction \"social network\" of a redox-sensitive protein in cells with high temporal resolution.\n\nSYNOPSIS TOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=51 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/833384v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5319bborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be7ea0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16b51d6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c9d400_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe circadian clock of Arabidopsis thaliana controls many physiological and molecular processes, allowing plants to anticipate daily changes in their environment. However, developing a detailed understanding of how oscillations in mRNA levels are connected to oscillations in post-transcriptional processes, such as splicing, has remained a challenge.\nC_LIO_LIHere we applied a combined approach using deep transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics tools to identify novel circadian regulated genes and splicing events.\nC_LIO_LIUsing a stringent approach, we identified 300 intron retention, 8 exon skipping, 79 alternative 3 splice site usage, 48 alternative 5 splice site usage, and 350 multiple (more than one event type) annotated events under circadian regulation. We also found 7 and 721 novel alternative exonic and intronic events.

    "abstract": "Toxic concentrations of aluminium cations and low phosphorus availability are the main yield-limiting factors in acidic soils, which represent half of the potentially available arable land. Brachiaria grasses, which are commonly sown as a forage in the tropics because of their resilience and low demand for nutrients, have a greater tolerance to high concentrations of aluminium cations than most other grass crops. In this work, we explored the natural variation in tolerance to aluminium cations (Al3+) between high and low tolerant Brachiaria species and characterised their transcriptional differences during stress. We also identified three QTLs associated with root vigour during Al3+ stress in their hybrid progeny. By integrating these results with a new Brachiaria reference genome, we have identified 30 genes responsible for Al3+ tolerance in Brachiaria. We also observed differential expression during stress of genes involved in RNA translation, response signalling, cell wall composition and vesicle location genes homologous to aluminium-induced proteins involved in limiting uptake or localizing the toxin. However, there was limited regulation of malate transporters in Brachiaria, which are associated with external tolerance mechanisms to Al3+ stress in other grasses. The contrasting regulation of RNA translation and response signalling suggests response phasing is critical to Al3+ tolerance.\n\nHIGHLIGHTWe identified QTLs, genes and molecular responses in high and low tolerant Brachiaria grasses associated with aspects of response to aluminium stress, such as regulation, cell-wall composition and active transport.",

    "abstract": "Most proteins in cell and tissue lysates are soluble. Here, we show that many of these proteins, including several that are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, are maintained in a soluble and functional state by association with endogenous RNA, as degradation of RNA invariably leads to protein aggregation. We identify the importance of nucleic acid structure, with single-stranded pyrimidine-rich bulges or loops surrounded by double-stranded regions being particularly efficient in this role, revealing an apparent one-to-one protein-nucleic acid stoichiometry. The relationship of these findings to pathological protein aggregation is suggested by our discovery that protein aggregates isolated from brain tissue from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients can be rendered soluble after refolding by both RNA and synthetic oligonucleotides. Together, these findings open new avenues for understanding the mechanism behind protein aggregation and shed light on how certain proteins remain soluble.",

Congruent and opposite neurons, two types of neurons found in these areas, prefer congruent inputs and opposite inputs from the two modalities, respectively. A recently proposed computational model of congruent and opposite neurons reproduces their tuning properties and shows that congruent neurons optimally integrate information while opposite neurons compute disparity information. However, the connections in the network are fixed rather than learned, and in fact the connections of opposite neurons, as we will show, cannot arise from Hebbian learning rules. We therefore propose a new model of multisensory integration in which congruent neurons and opposite neurons emerge through Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules, and show that these neurons exhibit experimentally observed tuning properties.",

Raw reads were converted to FASTQ, aligned to reference sequences, and assembled into contigs. Multi-sequence alignments of the contigs were generated and used for cladistics analysis.\n\nResultsWe sequenced full-length HIV-1 from the transcriptional start site to 3 LTR (100% virion genome) in 3 out of 15 isolates (89.6, NLAD8, AD17), achieving majority coverage (defined as > 50%) in another 7 out of 15 isolates. Inspection of NLAD8 sequence alignments revealed splicing or deletion signatures. Despite the strong 3 bias, read coverage was sufficient to evaluate single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions in 9 isolates, and to assemble HIV-1 genomes directly from viral RNA, achieving a maximum of 94% assembly coverage for NLAD8. Phylogenetic relationships were maintained at the level of contigs, as well as individual reads.\n\nConclusionsONT native RNA sequencing performed as expected, covering full-length HIV-1 RNA without PCR or cDNA sequencing. Native single-molecule RNA sequencing supported previous models of HIV-1 replication, and samples exhibited strain-specific transcriptional signals. We propose Context Dependency Variant Classification to describe variants occurring in information-dense regions of HIV. These data provide rich resources for emerging RNA modification detection schemes. Future work will expand HIV-1 transcript profiling to infection models and clinical samples.",

We queried CMap 2 with CMap 1-derived signatures, expecting CMap 2 would highly prioritize the queried compounds; success rate was 17%. Analysis of previously published prioritizations yielded similar results. Low recall is caused by low differential expression (DE) reproducibility both between CMaps and within each CMap. DE strength was predictive of reproducibility, and is influenced by compound concentration and cell-line responsiveness. Reproducibility of CMap 2 sample expression levels was also lower than expected. We attempted to identify the \"better\" CMap by comparison with a third dataset, but they were mutually discordant.

    "abstract": "Intracellular pathogens commonly manipulate the host lysosomal system for their survival, however whether this affects the organization and functioning of the lysosomal system itself is not known. Here, we show using in vitro and in vivo infections that the lysosomal content and activity is globally elevated in M. tuberculosis infected macrophages. The enhanced lysosomal state is sustained over time and defines an adaptive homeostasis of the infected cell. Lysosomal alterations are caused by mycobacterial surface components, notably the cell wall lipid SL-1, which functions through the mTORC1-TFEB axis. Mtb mutant defective for SL-1 levels shows reduced lysosomal content and activity compared to wild type. Importantly, this phenotype is conserved during in vivo infection. The alteration in lysosomal phenotype in mutant Mtb lead to decreased lysosomal delivery of Mtb, and importantly, increased survival of intracellular Mtb. These results define the global alterations in the host lysosomal system as a crucial distinguishing feature of Mtb infected macrophages that is host protective and contribute to the containment of the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Magnaporthe oryzae is a filamentous ascomycete fungus that causes devastating diseases of crops that include rice and wheat, and a variety of turf, forage and wild grasses. Strains from ryegrasses possess highly stable chromosome ends that undergo frequent rearrangements during vegetative growth in culture and in planta. Instability is associated with the presence of two related retrotransposons (Magnaporthe oryzae Telomeric Retrotransposons - MoTeRs) inserted within the telomere repeat tracts. The objective of the present study was to determine the mechanisms by which MoTeRs promote telomere instability. Targeted cloning, restriction mapping, and sequencing of both parental and novel telomeric restriction fragments, along with MinION sequencing of DNA from three single-spore cultures, allowed us to document the molecular alterations for 109 newly-formed telomeres. Rearrangement events included truncations of subterminal rDNA sequences; acquisition of MoTeR insertions by \"plain\" telomeres; insertion of the MAGGY retrotransposons into MoTeR arrays; expansion and contraction of subtelomeric tandem repeats; MoTeR truncations; duplication and terminalization of internal sequences; and breakage at long, interstitial telomeres generated during MoTeR insertion. Together, our data show that when MoTeRs invade the telomeres, they can dramatically perturb the integrity of chromosome ends, leading to the generation of unprotected DNA termini whose repair has the potential to generate chromosome alterations that extend well into the genome interior.",

These analyses showed that the genus Romboutsia covers a broad range of metabolic capabilities with respect to carbohydrate utilization, fermentation of single amino acids, anaerobic respiration and metabolic end products. Main differences between strains were found in their abilities to utilize specific carbohydrates, to synthesize vitamins and other cofactors, and their nitrogen assimilation capabilities.

One critical molecular signal for maternal behavior is oxytocin, a hormone centrally released by hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Oxytocin enables plasticity within the auditory cortex, a necessary step for responding to infant vocalizations. To determine how this change occurs during natural experience, we continuously monitored homecage behavior of female virgin mice co-housed for days with an experienced mother and litter, synchronized with recordings from virgin PVN cells, including from oxytocin neurons. Mothers engaged virgins in maternal care by ensuring their nest presence, and demonstrated maternal behavior in self-generated pup retrieval episodes. These social interactions activated virgin PVN and gated behaviorally-relevant cortical plasticity for pup vocalizations. Thus rodents can acquire maternal behavior by social transmission, and our results describe a mechanism for adapting brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via endogenous oxytocin.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMother mice help co-housed virgins become maternal by enacting specific behaviors that activate virgin oxytocin neurons.",

We have found that pancreatic beta cells from Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice express significantly lower levels of GLP-1R than C57BL/6 mice, leaving the NOD beta cells with an impaired response to GLP-1 stimulation. The lower expression appears to be caused by accelerated degradation of GLP-1R in the beta cells, a process that can be reversed by inhibiting trafficking to the lysosome. Importantly, our results appear to translate to the human disease since we also observed significantly lower expression of the GLP-1R in pancreatic islets from donors with type 1 diabetes.

Our ability to understand the developmental and evolutionary forces that shape these morphologies is limited by a lack of studies on certain USOs and plant clades. Bomarea multiflora (Alstroemeriaceae) is a monocot with tuberous roots, filling a key gap in our understanding of USO development. We take a comparative transcriptomics approach to characterizing the molecular mechanisms of tuberous root formation in B. multiflora and compare these mechanisms to those identified in other USOs across diverse plant lineages. We sequenced transcriptomes from the growing tip of four tissue types (aerial shoot, rhizome, fibrous root, and root tuber) of three individuals of B. multiflora. We identify differentially expressed isoforms between tuberous and non-tuberous roots and test the expression of a priori candidate genes implicated in underground storage in other taxa. We identify 271 genes that are differentially expressed in root tubers versus non-tuberous roots, including genes implicated in cell wall modification, defense response, and starch biosynthesis. We also identify a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP), which has been implicated in tuberization signalling in other taxa and, through gene-tree analysis, place this copy in a phylogenytic context. These findings suggest that some similar molecular processes underlie the formation of underground storage structures across flowering plants despite the long evolutionary distances among taxa and non-homologous morphologies (e.g., bulbs versus tubers).",

    "abstract": "In many species, cultures, and contexts, social dominance reflects the ability to exert influence over others, and the question of what makes an effective leader is pertinent to a range of disciplines and contexts. While dominant individuals are often assumed to be most influential, the behavioral traits that make them dominant may also make them socially aversive and thereby reduce their influence. Here we examine the influence of dominant and subordinate males on group behavior in different social contexts using the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. We find that phenotypically dominant males display behavioral traits that typify leadership across taxonomic systems - aggressive, social centrality, and movement leadership, while subordinate males are passive, socially peripheral, and have little influence over movement. However, in a more complex group-consensus task involving visual cue associations, subordinate males become the most effective agents of social change. We find that dominant males are spatially distant and have lower signal-to-noise ratios of informative behavior in the association task, potentially interfering with their ability to generate group-consensus. In contrast, subordinate males are physically close to other group members, have high signal-to-noise behaviors in the association task, and visual connectivity to other group members equal to that of dominant males. The attributes that define effective social influence are therefore highly context-specific, with socially and phenotypically dominant males being influential in routine but not complex social scenarios. These results demonstrate that behavioral traits that are typical of socially dominant individuals may actually reduce their social influence in other contexts.\n\nSignificance StatementThe attributes that allow individuals to attain positions of social power and dominance are common across many vertebrate social systems - aggression, intimidation, coercion. Yet these traits are socially aversive, and can make dominant individuals poor agents of social change. In a vertebrate system (social cichlid fish) we show that dominant males are aggressive, socially central, and lead group movement. Yet dominant males are poor effectors of consensus in an more sophisticated association task compared with passive, socially-peripheral subordinate males. The most effective agents of social influence possess behavioral traits opposite of those typically found in position of social dominance, suggesting the behavioral processes that generate social dominance may simultaneously place the most ineffective leaders in positions of power.",

    "abstract": "A common way to integrate and analyze large amounts of biological \"omic\" data is through pathway reconstruction: using condition-specific omic data to create a subnetwork of a generic background network that represents some process or cellular state. A challenge in pathway reconstruction is that adjusting pathway reconstruction algorithms parameters produces pathways with drastically different topological properties and biological interpretations. Due to the exploratory nature of pathway reconstruction, there is no ground truth for direct evaluation, so parameter tuning methods typically used in statistics and machine learning are inapplicable. We developed the pathway parameter advising algorithm to tune pathway reconstruction algorithms to minimize biologically implausible predictions. We leverage background knowledge in pathway databases to select pathways whose high-level structure resembles that of manually curated biological pathways. At the core of this method is a graphlet decomposition metric, which measures topological similarity to curated biological pathways. In order to evaluate pathway parameter advising, we compare its performance in avoiding implausible networks and reconstructing pathways from the NetPath database with other parameter selection methods across four pathway reconstruction algorithms. We also demonstrate how pathway parameter advising can guide construction of an influenza host factor network. Pathway parameter advising is method-agnostic; it is applicable to any pathway reconstruction algorithm with tunable parameters.

    "abstract": "Third-generation cephalosporin resistance (3GC-R) in Escherichia coli is a rising problem in human and farmed animal populations. We conducted whole genome sequencing analysis of 138 representative 3GC-R isolates previously collected from dairy farms in South West England and confirmed by PCR to carry acquired 3GC-R genes. This analysis identified blaCTX-M (131 isolates: encoding CTX-M-1, -14, -15, -32 and the novel variant, CTX-M-214), blaCMY-2 (6 isolates) and blaDHA-1 (one isolate). A highly conserved plasmid was identified in 73 isolates, representing 27 E. coli sequence types. This novel ~220 kb IncHI2 plasmid carrying blaCTX-M-32 was sequenced to closure and designated pMOO-32. It was found experimentally to be stable in cattle and human transconjugant E. coli even in the absence of selective pressure and was found by multiplex PCR to be present on 26 study farms representing a remarkable range of transmission over 1500 square kilometres. However, the plasmid was not found amongst human urinary E. coli we have recently characterised from people living in the same geographical location, collected in parallel with farm sampling. There were close relatives of two blaCTX-M plasmids circulating amongst eight human and two cattle isolates, and a closely related blaCMY-2 plasmid found in one cattle and one human isolate. However, phylogenetic evidence of recent sharing of 3GC-R strains between farms and humans in the same region was not found.\n\nImportanceThird-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) are critically important antibacterials and 3GC-resistance (3GC-R) threatens human health, particularly in the context of opportunistic pathogens such as Escherichia coli. There is some evidence for zoonotic transmission of 3GC-R E. coli through food, but little work has been done examining possible transmission (e.g. via interaction of people with the local near-farm environment). We characterised acquired 3GC-R E. coli found on dairy farms in a geographically restricted region of the United Kingdom and compared these with E. coli from people living in the same region, collected in parallel. Whilst there is strong evidence for recent farm-to-farm transmission of 3GC-R strains and plasmids - including one epidemic plasmid that has a remarkable capacity to transmit - there was no evidence that 3GC-R found on study farms had a significant impact on circulating 3GC-R E. coli strains or plasmids in the local human population.",

    "abstract": "PurposeMany rare ovarian cancer subtypes such as small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) have poor prognosis due to their aggressive nature and resistance to standard platinum and taxane based chemotherapy. The development of effective therapeutics has been hindered by the rarity of such tumors. We sought to identify targetable vulnerabilities in rare ovarian cancer subtypes.\n\nExperimental DesignWe compared the global proteomic landscape of six cases each of endometrioid ovarian cancer (ENOC), clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC), and SCCOHT to the most common subtype high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) to identify potential therapeutic targets. Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays were used as validation of ASS1 deficiency. The efficacy of arginine-depriving therapeutic ADI-PEG20 was assessed in vitro using cell lines and patient derived xenograft mouse models representing SCCOHT.\n\nResultsGlobal proteomic analysis identified low ASS1 expression in ENOC, CCOC, and SCCOHT compared to HGSC. Low ASS1 levels were validated through IHC in a large patient cohort. The lowest levels of ASS1 were observed in SCCOHT, where ASS1 was absent in 2/15 cases, and expressed in less than 5% of the tumor cells in 8/15 cases. ASS1 deficient ovarian cancer cells were sensitive to ADI-PEG20 treatment regardless of subtype in vitro. Furthermore, in two cell line mouse xenograft models and one patient derived mouse xenograft model of SCCOHT, once a week treatment of ADI-PEG20 (30mg/kg and 15mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth in vivo.\n\nConclusionsPreclinical in vitro and in vivo studies identified ADI-PEG20 as a potential therapy for patients with rare ovarian cancers including SCCOHT.\n\nTranslational relevanceMany rare ovarian cancers lack effective management strategies and are resistant to the standard platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy. Thus, for a rare ovarian cancer subtype like small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) - an aggressive malignancy affecting young women in their twenties, effective targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. We used global proteomics to identify a deficiency in arginosuccinate synthase (ASS1) as a common feature among some rare ovarian cancer subtypes. Using in-vitro and in-vivo models, we demonstrated that the arginine-depriving investigational agent ADI-PEG20 effectively inhibited cell growth in ASS1 deficient ovarian cancers including SCCOHT, establishing it as a potential therapeutic agent for rare ovarian cancer subtypes deficient in ASS1.

    "abstract": "Many endocrine organs show prevalent autoimmune diseases (AID) such as type-1-diabetes and Hashimotos-thyroiditis. The fundamental origins of these diseases is unclear. Here we address AID from the viewpoint of feedback control. Endocrine tissues maintain their mass by feedback-loops that balance cell proliferation and removal according to input signals related to the hormone function. Such feedback is unstable to mutant cells that mis-sense the signal, and therefore hyper-proliferate and hyper-secrete the hormone. We hypothesize that in order to prevent these mutants from expanding, each organ has a dedicated  autoimmune surveillance of hyper-secreting mutants (ASHM), in which hyper-secreting cells are preferentially eliminated, at the cost of a fragility to AID. ASHM correctly predicts the identity of the self-antigens and the presence of T-cells against these self-antigens in healthy individuals. It offers a predictive theory for which tissues get frequent AID, and which do not and instead show frequent mutant-expansion disease (e.g. hyperparathyroidism).",

    "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated that when learning a new motor task, the nervous system modifies feedforward (ie. voluntary) motor commands and that such learning transfers to fast feedback (ie. reflex) responses evoked by mechanical perturbations. Here we show the inverse, that learning new feedback responses transfers to feedforward motor commands. Sixty human participants (34 females) used a robotic exoskeleton and either 1) received short duration mechanical perturbations (20 ms) that created pure elbow rotation or 2) generated self-initiated pure elbow rotations. They did so with the shoulder joint free to rotate (normal arm dynamics) or locked (altered arm dynamics) by the robotic manipulandum. With the shoulder unlocked, the perturbation evoked clear shoulder muscle activity in the long-latency stretch reflex epoch (50-100ms post-perturbation), as required for countering the imposed joint torques, but little muscle activity thereafter in the so-called voluntary response. After locking the shoulder joint, which alters the required joint torques to counter pure elbow rotation, we found a reliable reduction in the long-latency stretch reflex over many trials. This reduction transferred to feedforward control as we observed 1) a reduction in shoulder muscle activity during self-initiated pure elbow rotation trials and 2) kinematic errors (ie. aftereffects) in the direction predicted when failing to compensate for normal arm dynamics, even though participants never practiced self-initiated movements with the shoulder locked. Taken together, our work shows that transfer between feedforward and feedback control is bidirectional, furthering the notion that these processes share common neural circuits that underlie motor learning and transfer.",

    "abstract": "Negotiating with others about how finite resources should be distributed is an important aspect of human social life. However, little is known about mechanisms underlying human social-interactive decision-making. Here, we report results from a novel iterative Ultimatum Game (UG) task, in which the proposers facial emotions and offer amounts were sampled probabilistically based on the participants decisions, creating a gradually evolving social-interactive decision-making environment. Our model-free results confirm the prediction that both the proposers facial emotions and the offer amount influence human choice behaviour. These main effects demonstrate that biases in facial emotion recognition also contribute to violations of the Rational Actor model (i.e. all offers should be accepted). Model-based analyses extend these findings, indicating that participants decisions are guided by an aversion to inequality in the UG. We highlight that the proposers facial responses to participant decisions dynamically modulate how human decision-makers perceive self-other inequality, relaxing its otherwise negative influence on decision values. In iterative games, this cognitive model underlies how offers initially rejected can gradually become more acceptable under increasing affective load, and accurately predicts 86% of participant decisions. Activity of the central arousal systems, assessed by measuring pupil size, encode a key element of this model: proposers affective reactions in response to participant decisions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that, under affective load, participants aversion to inequality is a malleable cognitive process which is modulated by the activity of the pupil-linked central arousal systems.",

    "abstract": "Cells adjust their metabolism in response to mutations, but how this reprogramming depends on the genetic context is not well known. Specifically, the absence of individual enzymes can affect reprogramming and thus the impact of mutations in cell growth. Here, we examine this issue with an in silico model of Saccharomyces cerevisiaes metabolism. By quantifying the variability in the growth rate of 10000 different mutant metabolisms that accumulated changes in their reaction fluxes, in the presence, or absence, of a specific enzyme, we distinguish a subset of modifier genes serving as buffers or potentiators of variability. We notice that the most potent modifiers refer to the glycolysis pathway and that, more broadly, they show strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Moreover, the evidence that this subset depends on the specific growing condition strengthens its systemic underpinning, a feature only observed before in a simple model of a gene-regulatory network. Some of these enzymes also modulate the effect that biochemical noise and environmental fluctuations produce in growth. Thus, the reorganization of metabolism triggered by mutations has not only direct physiological implications but also changes the influence that other mutations have on growth. This is a general result with implications in the development of cancer therapies based on metabolic inhibitors.",

In contrast, S1PR1 inhibition, mediated by the antagonist NIBR0213 or LEC-specific genetic deletion of S1pr1, promotes filopodia formation and vessel branching, independent of VEGF-A. To investigate the S1P and VEGF-A signaling crosstalk observed in vivo, we used LECs cultured in vitro. We demonstrate that S1P activates endogenous S1PR1 in a constitutive, autocrine manner. Importantly, S1P-S1PR1 activity was required for VEGF-A-induced LEC proliferation and strongly supported ERK1/2 activation and VEGFR-2 trafficking to the perinuclear area. In conclusion, S1P-S1PR1 signaling promotes VEGF-A-dependent LEC proliferation and limits migratory and filopodia-forming responses.

    "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are CD44 expressing cells that reside in the alveolar space where they maintain lung homeostasis by serving critical roles in immunosurveillance and lipid surfactant catabolism. AMs lacking CD44 are unable to bind the glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan, which compromises their survival and leads to reduced numbers of AMs in the lung. Using RNA sequencing, lipidomics and multiparameter flow cytometry, we demonstrate that CD44-/- mice have impaired AM lipid homeostasis and increased surfactant lipids in the lung. CD44-/- AMs had increased expression of CD36, a lipid scavenger receptor, as well as increased intracellular lipid droplets, giving them a foamy appearance. RNA sequencing revealed the differential expression of genes associated with lipid efflux and metabolism in CD44-/- AMs. Lipidomic analysis showed increased lipids in both the supernatant and cell pellet extracted from the bronchoalveolar lavage of CD44-/- mice. Phosphatidylcholine species, cholesterol, oxidized phospholipids and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased in CD44-/- AMs. Oxidized phospholipids were more cytotoxic to CD44-/- AMs and induced greater lung inflammation in CD44-/- mice. Reconstitution of CD44+/+ mice with CD44-/- bone marrow as well as adoptive transfer of CD44-/- AMs into CD44+/+ mice showed that lipid accumulation in CD44-/- AMs occurred irrespective of the lung environment, suggesting a cell intrinsic defect. Administration of colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF-2), a critical factor in AM development and maintenance, increased AM numbers in CD44-/- mice and decreased phosphatidylcholine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage, but was unable to decrease intracellular lipid accumulation in CD44-/- AMs. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}), downstream of CSF-2 signaling and a regulator of lipid metabolism, was reduced in the nucleus of CD44-/- AMs, and PPAR{gamma} inhibition in normal AMs increased their lipid droplets. Thus, CD44 deficiency causes defects in AMs that lead to abnormal lipid accumulation and oxidation, which exacerbates oxidized lipid-induced lung inflammation. Collectively, these findings implicate CD44 as a regulator of lung homeostasis and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Arterial spin labeling (ASL) has undergone significant development since its inception, with a focus on improving standardization and reproducibility of its acquisition and quantification. In a community-wide effort towards robust and reproducible clinical ASL image processing, we developed the software package ExploreASL, allowing standardized analyses across centers and scanners.\n\nThe procedures used in ExploreASL capitalize on published image processing advancements and address the challenges of multi-center datasets with scanner-specific processing and artifact reduction to limit patient exclusion. ExploreASL is self-contained, written in MATLAB and based on Statistical Parameter Mapping (SPM) and runs on multiple operating systems. The toolbox adheres to previously defined international standards for data structure, provenance, and best analysis practice.\n\nExploreASL was iteratively refined and tested in the analysis of >10,000 ASL scans using different pulse-sequences in a variety of clinical populations, resulting in four processing modules: Import, Structural, ASL, and Population that perform tasks, respectively, for data curation, structural and ASL image processing and quality control, and finally preparing the results for statistical analyses on both single-subject and group level. We illustrate ExploreASL processing results from three cohorts: perinatally HIV-infected children, healthy adults, and elderly at risk for neurodegenerative disease. We show the reproducibility for each cohort when processed at different centers with different operating systems and MATLAB versions, and its effects on the quantification of gray matter cerebral blood flow.\n\nExploreASL facilitates the standardization of image processing and quality control, allowing the pooling of cohorts to increase statistical power and discover between-group perfusion differences. Ultimately, this workflow may advance ASL for wider adoption in clinical studies, trials, and practice.",

NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV X(X) XXX-XXX, XXXX. - The use of modern neuroimaging approaches has demonstrated resting-state regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to be tightly coupled to resting cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRglu) in healthy brains. In schizophrenia, several lines of evidence point towards aberrant neurovascular coupling, especially in the prefrontal regions. To investigate this, we used Signed Differential Mapping to undertake a voxel-based bimodal meta-analysis examining the relationship between rCBF and rCMRglu in schizophrenia, as measured by Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) and 18Flurodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) respectively. We used 19 studies comprised of data from 557 patients and 584 controls. Our results suggest that several key regions implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia such as the frontoinsular cortex, dorsal ACC, putamen, and temporal pole show conjoint metabolic and perfusion abnormalities in patients. In contrast, discordance between metabolism and perfusion were seen in superior frontal gyrus and cerebellum, indicating that factors contributing to neurovascular uncoupling (e.g. inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress) are likely operates at these loci. Hybrid ASL-PET studies focusing on these regions could confirm our proposition.",

In this work, expanding on previous studies, we analyse the immunogenic properties of mutations that are known to drive resistance to cancer targeted-therapies. We survey a large dataset of mutations that confer resistance to different drugs and occur in numerous genes and tumour types. We show that a significant number of these mutations are predicted in silico to have immunogenic potential across a large proportion of the human population. Two of these mutations had previously been experimentally validated and it was confirmed that some of their associated neopeptides elicit T-cell responses in vitro. The identification of potent cancer-specific antigens can be instrumental for developing more effective immunotherapies. Resistance mutations, several of which are known to recur in different patients, could be of particular interest in the context of off-the-shelf precision immunotherapies such as therapeutic cancer vaccines.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOlder-age individuals are at the highest risk for disability from a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Astrocytes are the most numerous glia in the brain, necessary for brain function, yet there is little known about unique responses of astrocytes in the aged-brain following TBI.\n\nMethodsOur approach examined astrocytes in young adult, 4-month-old, versus aged, 18-month-old mice, at 1, 3, and 7 days post-TBI. We selected these time points to span the critical period in the transition from acute injury to presumably irreversible tissue damage and disability. Two approaches were used to define the astrocyte contribution to TBI by age interaction: 1) tissue histology and morphological phenotyping, and 2) transcriptomics on enriched astrocytes from the injured brain.\n\nResultsAging was found to have a profound effect on the TBI-induced loss of homeostatic astrocyte function needed for maintaining water transport and edema - namely, aquaporin-4. The loss of homoeostatic responses was coupled with a progressive exacerbation of astrogliosis in the aged brain as a function of time after injury. Moreover, clasmatodendrosis, an underrecognized astrogliopathy, was found to be significantly increased in the aged brain, but not in the young brain. As a function of TBI, we observed a transitory refraction in the number of these astrocytes, which rebounded by 7 days post-injury in the aged brain. The transcriptomics found disproportionate changes in genes attributed to reactive astrocytes, inflammatory response, complement pathway, and synaptic support in aged mice following TBI compared to young mice. Additionally, our data highlight that TBI did not evoke a clear alignment with previously defined \"A1/A2\" dichotomy of reactive astrogliosis.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our findings point toward a progressive phenotype of aged astrocytes following TBI that we hypothesize to be maladaptive, shedding new insights into potentially modifiable astrocyte-specific mechanisms that may underlie increased fragility of the aged brain to trauma.",

Advances in quantum computing systems and our classical, quantum-inspired algorithm GAMA (Graver Aug-mented Multi-seed Algorithm) motivated us to revisit methods for identifying altered pathways. Using different types of quantum and classical algorithms, we report novel formulations of the problem that are tailored to these new computational models. Our formulations require fewer binary variables than available methods, and offer a tuning parameter that allows a trade-off between coverage and exclusivity; varying this parameter returns a variety of solutions. We illustrate our formulations and methods with TCGA mutation data for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both the D-Wave quantum annealing solver and the classical GAMA solver returned altered pathways that are known to be important in AML, with different tuning parameter values returning alternative altered pathways. Our reduced-variable algorithm and QUBO problem for-mulations demonstrate how quantum annealing-based binary optimization solvers can be used now in cancer genomics.",

This integrated approach including quantitative comparison with cryo-electron microscopy data provides hitherto unexplored details of the native shield architecture and its difference from the high-mannose glycoform.

    "abstract": "Cave animals are a fascinating group of species often demonstrating characteristics including reduced eyes and pigmentation, metabolic efficiency, and enhanced sensory systems. Asellus aquaticus, an isopod crustacean, is an emerging model for cave biology. Cave and surface forms of this species differ in many characteristics, including eye size, pigmentation and antennal length. Existing resources for this species include a linkage map, mapped regions responsible for eye and pigmentation traits, sequenced adult transcriptomes, and comparative embryological descriptions of the surface and cave forms. Our ultimate goal is to identify genes and mutations responsible for the differences between the cave and surface forms. To advance this goal, we decided to use a transcriptomic approach. Because many of these changes first appear during embryonic development, we sequenced embryonic transcriptomes of cave, surface, and hybrid individuals at the stage when eyes and pigment become evident in the surface form. We generated a cave, a surface, a hybrid, and an integrated transcriptome to identify differentially expressed genes in the cave and surface forms. Additionally, we identified genes with allele-specific expression in hybrid individuals. These embryonic transcriptomes are an important resource to assist in our ultimate goal of determining the genetic underpinnings of the divergence between the cave and surface forms.",

A unique deep intronic homozygous variant in the PSMC3 gene (c.1127+337A>G, p.Ser376Argfs15*), encoding the 26S proteasome ATPase ring subunit 5 (Rpt5) was identified leading to the transcription of a cryptic exon. Patients fibroblasts exhibited impaired protein homeostasis characterized by accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins suggesting severe proteotoxic stress. Indeed, the TCF11/Nrf1 transcriptional pathway allowing proteasome recovery after proteasome inhibition is permanently activated in the patients fibroblasts. Upon chemical proteasome inhibition this pathway is however impaired. These cells were unable to compensate for proteotoxic stress although a higher proteasome content. Two different zebrafish studies led to inner ear development anomalies as well as cataracts. PSMC3 proteasome subunit dysfunction leads to various neurological manifestations, early onset cataracts and deafness and suggest that Rpt5 plays a major role in inner ear, lens and central nervous system development.",

    "abstract": "With the exception of mRNA splicing, little is known about co-transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that link noncoding variation to variation in organismal traits. To begin addressing this gap, we used 3 Seq to characterize alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the nuclear and total RNA fractions of 52 HapMap Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines, which we have studied extensively in the past. We identified thousands of polyadenylation sites that are differentially detected in nuclear mRNA and whole cell mRNA, and found that APA is an important mediator of genetic effects on gene regulation and complex traits. Specifically, we mapped 602 apaQTLs at 10% FDR, of which 152 were found only in the nuclear fraction. Nuclear-specific apaQTLs are highly enriched in introns and are also often associated with changes in steady-state expression levels, suggesting a widespread mechanism whereby genetic variants decrease mRNA expression levels by increasing usage of intronic PAS. We identified 24 apaQTLs associated with protein expression levels, but not mRNA expression, and found that eQTLs that are not associated with chromatin QTLs are enriched in apaQTLs. These findings support multiple independent pathways through which genetic effects on APA can impact gene regulation. Finally, we found that 19% of apaQTLs were also previously associated with disease. Thus, our work demonstrates that APA links genetic variation to variation in gene expression levels, protein expression levels, and disease risk, and reveals uncharted modes of genetic regulation.",

To ameliorate this problem, we developed and optimised a new high cell density (HCD) medium for S. cerevisiae. Starting from a widely-used synthetic medium composition, we systematically varied the concentrations of all components without the addition of other compounds. We used response surface methodology (RSM) to develop and optimise the five components of the medium: glucose, yeast nitrogen base, amino acids, mono-sodium glutamate and inositol. We monitored growth, cell number and cell size to ensure that the optimisation was towards a greater density of cells rather than just towards an increase in biomass (i.e larger cells). Cells grown in the final medium, HCD, exhibit growth more similar to the complex medium YPD than to the synthetic medium SD, while the final cell density prior to the diauxic shift is increased about three- and tenfold, respectively. We found normal cell-cycle behaviour throughout the growth phases by monitoring DNA content and protein expression using fluorescent reporters. We also ensured that HCD media could be used with a variety of strains and that they allow selection for all common yeast auxotrophic markers.",

As such, when the NbSyn87 is expressed in the absence of hSyn, it is continuously degraded by the proteasome, while it is stabilized when it binds to hSyn. Here, we exploited this feature to design a new Fluorescent Reporter for hSyn (FluoReSyn) by coupling NbSyn87 to fluorescent proteins, which results in fluorescence signal fluctuations depending on the presence and amounts of intracellular hSyn.

    "abstract": "BackgroundTendon injury is a significant clinical problem, and regenerative treatments are limited by our understanding of endogenous tendon stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that tendon stem cells are diverse in phenotypic character, and may in fact exist on a spectrum of differentiation capacities. However, the functional significance of each differentiation phenotype is poorly understood. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive assessment of differentiation capacity toward four connective tissue lineages (adipose, bone, cartilage and tendon) with clonal tendon stem cell lines to: 1) evaluate the differences, if any, in tenogenic potential, and 2) identify the relationships in differentiation phenotype and proliferation capacity.\n\nMethodsTendon stem cells were derived from whole equine flexor tendons for this study (N=3). Clonal tendon stem lines were generated by low-density cell plating, and subjected to standard assays of tri-lineage differentiation and population doublings. For tenogenesis, a previously engineered three-dimensional hydrogel construct was incorporated. Differentiation was quantified by the relative gene expression of lineage-specific markers, and confirmed with lineage-specific cell staining. Tenogenesis was further analyzed by hydrogel contraction and histomorphometry. Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukeys tests.\n\nResultsThree distinct tendon stem cell phenotypes were identified, namely differentiation toward: 1) adipose, bone, cartilage and tendon, 2) bone, cartilage and tendon, or 3) adipose, cartilage and tendon. Further, a positive correlation was found in the ability to differentiate toward all four lineages and the generation of a robust, composite tendon-like construct upon tenogenesis, manifested by the strongest expressions of scleraxis and mohawk, and parallel alignment of tenocyte-like cells with elongated cell morphologies. Significantly increased numbers of cumulative cell population doublings were seen in the absence of adipogenic potential in clonal tendon stem cell lines.\n\nConclusionsOur study strengthens reports on the heterogeneous character of tendon stem cells and identifies key differences in their differentiation and proliferative potentials. Isolation of potent tendon stem cell populations from tendon stromal fractions may yield improved therapeutic benefits in clinical models of repair and promote a native, regenerative phenotype in engineered tendons. Future studies may be targeted to understanding the functional contributions of each tendon stem cell phenotype in vivo, and identifying additional cell phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "During angiogenesis, endothelial cells engage components of the extracellular matrix through integrin-mediated adhesion. Endothelial expression of laminin-411 and laminin-511 are known to promote vessel stability. However, little is known about the contribution of these laminins to endothelial morphogenesis. We used two organotypic cell culture angiogenesis assays in conjunction with RNAi approaches to demonstrate that depletion of either the 4 chain of laminin-411 or the 5 chain of laminin-511 from endothelial cells inhibits sprouting and tube formation. Depletion of 6 integrins resulted in similar phenotypes. Gene expression analysis indicated that loss of either laminin-511 or 6 integrins inhibited the expression of CXCR4, a gene previously associated with angiogenic endothelial cells. Pharmacological or RNAi-dependent inhibition of CXCR4 suppressed endothelial sprouting and morphogenesis. Importantly, expression of recombinant CXCR4 rescued endothelial morphogenesis when the 6 integrin expression was inhibited. Additionally, the depletion of 6 integrins from established tubes resulted in the loss of tube integrity and laminin-511. Taken together, our results indicate that 6 integrins and laminin-511 can promote endothelial morphogenesis by regulating the expression of CXCR4 and suggest that the 6-dependent deposition of laminin-511 protects the integrity of established endothelial tubes.\n\nSummary statementEndothelial-secreted laminin-511 and 6 integrins promote endothelial morphogenesis by regulating the expression of the chemokine receptor, CXCR4. The depletion of 6 integrins from established tubes results in the loss of tube integrity and laminin-511.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection is a significant driver of speciation. Yet it remains largely unknown whether local adaptation can drive speciation through the evolution of hybrid sterility between populations. Here, we show that adaptive divergence in shoot gravitropism, the ability of a plants shoot to bend upwards in response to the downward pull of gravity, contributes to the evolution of hybrid sterility in an Australian wildflower, Senecio lautus. We find that shoot gravitropism has evolved multiple times in association with plant height between adjacent populations inhabiting contrasting environments, suggesting that these traits have evolved by natural selection. We directly tested this prediction using a hybrid population subjected to eight rounds of recombination and three rounds of selection in the field. It revealed that shoot gravitropism responds to natural selection in the expected direction of the locally adapted population. This provided an ideal platform to test whether genetic differences in gravitropism contribute to hybrid sterility in S. lautus. Using this advanced hybrid population, we discovered that crossing individuals with extreme differences in gravitropism reduce their ability to produce seed by 21%, providing strong evidence that this adaptive trait is genetically correlated with hybrid sterility. Our results suggest that natural selection can drive the evolution of locally adaptive traits that also create hybrid sterility, thus indicating an evolutionary connection between local adaptation and the origin of new species.\n\nSignificance statementNew species originate as populations become reproductively isolated from one another. Despite recent progress in uncovering the genetic basis of reproductive isolation, it remains unclear whether intrinsic reproductive barriers, such as hybrid sterility, evolve as a by-product of local adaptation to contrasting environments or evolve through non-ecological processes, such as meiotic drive. Here, we show that differences in a plants response to the pull of gravity have repeatedly evolved amongst coastal populations of an Australian wildflower, thus implicating a role of natural selection in their evolution. We found a strong genetic correlation between variation in this adaptive trait and hybrid sterility, suggesting that intrinsic reproductive barriers contribute to the origin of new species as populations adapt to heterogeneous environments.",

    "abstract": "A key step in the clinical production of CAR-T cells is the expansion of engineered T cells. To generate enough cells for a therapeutic product, cells must be chronically stimulated, which raises the risk of inducing T-cell exhaustion and reducing therapeutic efficacy. As protocols for T-cell expansion are being developed to optimize CAR T cell yield, function and persistence, fundamental questions about the impact of in vitro manipulation on T-cell identity are important to answer. Namely: 1) what types of cells are generated during chronic stimulation? 2) how many unique cell states can be defined during chronic stimulation? We sought to answer these fundamental questions by performing single-cell multiomic analysis to simultaneously measure expression of 39 proteins and 399 genes in human T cells expanded in vitro. This approach allowed us to study - with unprecedented depth - how T cells change over the course of chronic stimulation. Comprehensive immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analysis at day 0 enabled a refined characterization of T-cell maturational states (from naive to TEMRA cells) and the identification of a donor-specific subset of terminally differentiated T-cells that would have been otherwise overlooked using canonical cell classification schema. As expected, T-cell activation induced downregulation of naive-associated markers and upregulation of effector molecules, proliferation regulators, co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors. Our deep kinetic analysis further revealed clusters of proteins and genes identifying unique states of activation defined by markers temporarily expressed upon 3 days of stimulation (PD-1, CD69, LTA), markers constitutively expressed throughout chronic activation (CD25, GITR, LGALS1), and markers uniquely up-regulated upon 14 days of stimulation (CD39, ENTPD1, TNFDF10). Notably, different ratios of cells expressing activation or exhaustion markers were measured at each time point. These data indicate high heterogeneity and plasticity of chronically stimulated T cells in response to different kinetics of activation. In this study, we demonstrate the power of a single-cell multiomic approach to comprehensively characterize T cells and to precisely monitor changes in differentiation, activation and exhaustion signatures in response to different activation protocols.",

    "abstract": "The BBSome is a heterooctameric protein complex that plays a central role in primary cilia homeostasis. Its malfunction causes the severe ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). The complex acts as a cargo adapter that recognizes signaling proteins such as GPCRs and links them to the intraflagellar transport machinery. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a human heterohexameric core subcomplex of the BBSome. The structure reveals the architecture of the complex in atomic detail. It explains how the subunits interact with each other and how disease-causing mutations hamper this interaction. The complex adopts a conformation that is open for binding to membrane-associated GTPase Arl6 and a large positively charged patch likely strengthens the interaction with the membrane. A prominent negatively charged cleft at the center of the complex is likely involved in binding of positively charged signaling sequences of cargo proteins.",

    "abstract": "Smooth pursuit eye movements are used by primates to track moving objects. They are initiated by sensory estimates of target speed represented in the middle temporal (MT) area of extrastriate visual cortex and then supported by motor feedback to maintain steady-state eye speed at target speed. Here, we show that reducing the coherence in a patch of dots for a tracking target degrades the eye speed both at the initiation of pursuit and during steady-state tracking, when eye speed reaches an asymptote well below target speed. The deficits are quantitatively different between the motor-supported steady-state of pursuit and the sensory-driven initiation of pursuit, suggesting separate mechanisms. The deficit in visually-guided pursuit initiation could not explain the deficit in steady-state tracking. Pulses of target speed during steady-state tracking revealed lower sensitivities to image motion across the retina for lower values of dot coherence. However, sensitivity was not zero, implying that visual motion should still be driving eye velocity towards target velocity. When we changed dot coherence from 100% to lower values during accurate steady-state pursuit, we observed larger eye decelerations for lower coherences, as expected if motor feedback was reduced in gain. A simple pursuit model accounts for our data based on separate modulation of the strength of visual-motor transmission and motor feedback. We suggest that reduced dot coherence creates less reliable target motion that impacts pursuit initiation by changing the gain of visual-motor transmission and perturbs steady-state tracking by modulation of the motor corollary discharges that comprise eye velocity memory.",

    "abstract": "Cortical oscillations have been proposed to play a functional role in speech and music perception, attentional selection and working memory, via the mechanism of neural entrainment. One of the most compelling arguments for neural entrainment is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. We tested the existence of this phenomenon by studying cortical neural oscillations during and after presentation of melodic stimuli in a passive perception paradigm. Melodies were composed of [~]60 and [~]80 Hz tones embedded in a 2.5 Hz stream. Using intracranial and surface recordings in humans, we reveal consistent neural response properties throughout the cortex, well beyond the auditory regions. Persistent oscillatory activity in the high-gamma band was observed in response to the tones. By contrast, in response to the 2.5 Hz stream, no persistent activity in any frequency band was observed. We further show that our data are well-captured by a model of damped harmonic oscillator and can be classified into three classes of neural dynamics, with distinct damping properties and eigenfrequencies. This model provides a mechanistic and quantitative explanation of the frequency selectivity of auditory neural entrainment in the human cortex.\n\nSignificance statementIt has been proposed that the functional role of cortical oscillations is subtended by a mechanism of entrainment, the synchronisation in phase or amplitude of neural oscillations to a periodic stimulation. We tested whether the modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts the rhythmic stimulation, a phenomenon considered to be one of the most compelling arguments for entrainment. Using intracranial and surface recordings of human listening to rhythmic auditory stimuli, we reveal consistent oscillatory responses throughout the cortex, with persistent activity of high-gamma oscillations. On the contrary, neural oscillations do not outlast low-frequency acoustic dynamics. We interpret our results as reflecting harmonic oscillator properties - a model ubiquitous in physics but rarely used in neuroscience.",
