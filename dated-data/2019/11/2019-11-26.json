    "abstract": "Wounding is caused by abiotic and biotic factors and triggers complex short- and long-term responses at the local and systemic level. These responses are under the control of complex signaling pathways, which are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the rapid activation of MKK4/5-MPK3/6 by wounding is independent of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling and that, contrary to what happens in tobacco, this fast module does not control wound-triggered JA accumulation in Arabidopsis. We also demonstrate that a second MAPK module, constituted by MKK3 and the clade-C MAPKs MPK1/2/7, is activated by wounding in an independent manner. We provide evidence that the activation of this MKK3-MPK1/2/7 module occurs mainly through wound-induced JA production via the transcriptional regulation of upstream clade-III MAP3Ks and particularly MAP3K14. We show that mkk3 mutant plants are more susceptible to the larvae of the generalist lepidopteran herbivore Spodoptera littoralis, indicating that the MKK3-MPK1/2/7 module is involved in counteracting insect feeding.\n\nOne sentence summaryWounding induces the parallel activation of a rapid signaling module (MKK4/5-MPK3/6) and a JA-dependent slow one (MAP3K14-MKK3-MPK1/2/7/14) to restrict insect feeding.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary schemas of brain organization now include multisensory processes both in low-level cortices as well as at early stages of stimulus processing. Evidence has also accumulated showing that unisensory stimulus processing can result in cross-modal effects. For example, task-irrelevant and lateralized sounds can activate visual cortices; a phenomenon referred to as the auditory-evoked contralateral occipital positivity (ACOP). Some claim this is an example of automatic attentional capture in visual cortices. Other results, however, indicate that context may play a determinant role. Here, we investigated whether selective attention to spatial features of sounds is a determining factor in eliciting the ACOP. We recorded high-density auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) while participants selectively attended and discriminated sounds according to four possible stimulus attributes: location, pitch, speaker identity or syllable. Sound acoustics were held constant, and their location was always equiprobable (50% left, 50% right). The only manipulation was to which sound dimension participants attended. We analysed the AEP data from healthy participants within an electrical neuroimaging framework. The presence of sound-elicited activations of visual cortices depended on the to-be-discriminated, goal-based dimension. The ACOP was elicited only when participants were required to discriminate sound location, but not when they attended to any of the non-spatial features. These results provide a further indication that the ACOP is not automatic. Moreover, our findings showcase the interplay between task-relevance and spatial (un)predictability in determining the presence of the cross-modal activation of visual cortices.",

    "abstract": "Wheel-running exercise in laboratory rodents (animal model useful to study the neurobiology of aerobic exercise) decreases behavioral markers of vulnerability to addictive properties of various drugs of abuse including cocaine. However, neurobiological mechanisms underpinning this protective effect are far from being fully characterized and understood. Here, 28-day-old female C57BL/6J mice were housed with (n=48) or without (n=48) a running wheel for 6 weeks before being tested for acute locomotor responsiveness and initiation of locomotor sensitization to intraperitoneal injections of 8 mg/kg cocaine. The long-term expression of sensitization took place 3 weeks after the last session. On the day after, all mice underwent a microPET imaging session with [18F]fallypride radiotracer (dopamine 2/3 receptor (D2/3R) antagonist). Exercised mice were less sensitive to acute and sensitized cocaine hyperlocomotor effects, such attenuation being particularly well-marked for long-term expression of sensitization ({eta}2p = 0.262). Additionally, we found that chronic administrations of cocaine was associated with a clear-cut increase of [18F]fallypride binding potential in mouse striatum ({eta}2p = 0.170), presumably reflecting an increase in postsynaptic D2/3R density in this region. Finally, we found evidence that wheel-running exercise was associated with a moderate decrease in D2/3R density in striatum ({eta}2p = 0.075), a mechanism that might contribute to protective properties of such form of exercise against drugs of abuse vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art silicon probes for electrical recording from neurons have thousands of recording sites. However, due to volume limitations there are typically many fewer wires carrying signals off the probe, which restricts the number of channels that can be recorded simultaneously. To overcome this fundamental constraint, we propose a novel method called electrode pooling that uses a single wire to serve many recording sites through a set of controllable switches. Here we present the framework behind this method and an experimental strategy to support it. We then demonstrate its feasibility by implementing electrode pooling on the Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array and characterizing its effect on signal and noise. Finally we use simulations to explore the conditions under which electrode pooling saves wires without compromising the content of the recordings. We make recommendations on the design of future devices to take advantage of this strategy.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological methods, i.e., M/EEG provide unique views into brain health. Yet, when building predictive models from brain data, it is often unclear how electrophysiology should be combined with other neuroimaging methods. Information can be redundant, useful common representations of multimodal data may not be obvious and multimodal data collection can be medically contraindicated, which reduces applicability. Here, we propose a multimodal model to robustly combine MEG, MRI and fMRI for prediction. We focus on age prediction as surrogate biomarker in 674 subjects from the Cam-CAN. Strikingly, MEG, fMRI and MRI showed additive effects supporting distinct brain-behavior associations. Moreover, the contribution of MEG was best explained by source-topography of power spectra between 8 and 30 Hz. Finally, we demonstrate that the model maintains benefits of stacking when data is missing. The proposed framework hence enables multimodal learning for a wide range of biomarkers from diverse types of brain signals.",

    "abstract": "From the point of view structural biology and protein engineering the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is an exceptionally attracting object. The tertiary structure of GFP is quite unique: it reminds a \"cylinder\" or a \"barrel\" consisting of beta-layers that contains an alpha-helix inside. The \"barrel\" is a special container for an alpha-helix serving to protect the latter from the influence of the surroundings. Therefore a reasonable question arises whether the \"barrel\" can function as a container for preservation and isolation of other peptides. The alpha-helix itself contains hydrophilic amino acids, whereas inside the barrel there are many molecules of bound water. We supposed that the central alpha-helix of green fluorescent protein could be substituted for foreign peptide. In this study we checked the possibility for creation of such a system on base of GFP, where the toxic peptide is isolated from the environment inside the protein. The modification of green fluorescent protein was carried out. An antimicrobial peptide was inserted into the central alpha-helix. The results of our experiments show that such a chimeric protein is compact, soluble and non-toxic for the producing cell culture, but its structure is destabilized. The obtained data show that the idea of use of green fluorescent proteins as a <<container>> for storing foreign peptides could be realized.",

Here, we show that embryonic development of cartilage in the skate (Leucoraja erinacea) mirrors that of mammals, with developing chondrocytes co-expressing genes encoding the transcription factors Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9. However, in skate, transcriptional features of developing cartilage persist into adulthood, both in peripheral chondrocytes and in cells of the fibrous perichondrium that ensheaths the skeleton. Using pulse-chase label retention experiments and multiplexed in situ hybridization, we identify a population of cycling Sox5/6/9+ perichondral progenitor cells that generate new cartilage during adult growth, and we show that persistence of chondrogenesis in adult skates correlates with ability to spontaneously repair cartilage injuries. Skates therefore offer a unique model for adult chondrogenesis and cartilage repair and may serve as inspiration for novel cell-based therapies for skeletal pathologies, such as osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "The recovery of injured or lost sensory neurons after trauma, disease or aging is a major scientific challenge. Upon hearing loss or balance disorder, regeneration of mechanosensory hair cells has been observed in fish, some amphibians and under special circumstances in birds, but is absent in adult mammals. In aquatic vertebrates, hair cells are not only present in the inner ear but also in neuromasts of the lateral line system. The zebrafish lateral line neuromast has an almost unlimited capacity to regenerate hair cells. This remarkable ability is possible due to the presence of neural stem/progenitor cells within neuromasts. In order to further characterize these stem cells, we use the expression of the neural progenitor markers Sox2 and Sox3, transgenic reporter lines, and morphological and topological analysis of the different cell types within the neuromast. We reveal new sub-populations of supporting cells, the sustentacular supporting cells and the neuromast stem cells. In addition, using loss-of-function and mutants of sox2 and sox3, we find that the combined activity of both genes is essential for lateral line development and regeneration. The capability of sox2/sox3 expressing stem cells to produce new hair cells, hair cell-precursors, and supporting cells after damage was analyzed in detail by time-lapse microscopy and immunofluorescence. We are able to provide evidence that sox2/3 expressing cells are the main contributors to the regenerated neuromast, and that their daughter cells are able to differentiate into most cell types of the neuromast.",

Our chief finding is the presence of intra-colony channels on the order of 10 m in diameter in E. coli biofilms. These channels have a characteristic structure and reform after total mechanical disaggregation of the colony. We present evidence that the channels transport particles and function to assist the absorption of nutrients.

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are major inflammatory cells that rapidly infiltrate injured tissues to provide antimicrobial functions. A key step in their response is the paracrine release of the attractant LTB4, which switches the migration mode from exploratory patrolling to coordinated swarming. This leads to dense clusters that may further disrupt tissue architecture. The coordination mechanism underpinning neutrophil swarms is elusive. Here we show that neutrophils swarms require mutual reinforcement of damage signalling at the wound core. New biosensors and live imaging in zebrafish revealed that neutrophil chemoattractant synthesis is triggered by a sustained calcium flux upon contact with necrotic tissue and sensing of the damage signal ATP. This  calcium alarm signal propagates in the nascent neutrophil cluster through connexin-43 hemichannels, which allow release of intracellular ATP. This enables rapid assembly of a centralised, supracellular chemoattractant source, which is instrumental for coordinated recruitment and maximal cell gathering.",

Since chromosome structure affects nucleus stiffness, gene regulation and DNA repair, here we investigate the relationship between 3D genome structure and constricted migration in cancer cells. Using melanoma (A375) cells, we identify phenotypic differences in cells that have undergone multiple rounds of constricted migration. These cells display a stably higher migration efficiency, elongated morphology, and differences in the distribution of Lamin A/C and heterochromatin. Hi-C experiments reveal differences in chromosome spatial compartmentalization specific to cells that have passed through constrictions and related alterations in expression of genes associated with migration and metastasis. Certain features of the 3D genome structure changes, such as a loss of B compartment interaction strength, are consistently observed after constricted migration in clonal populations of A375 cells and in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our observations suggest that consistent types of chromosome structure changes are induced or selected by passage through constrictions and that these may epigenetically encode stable differences in gene expression and cellular migration phenotype.",

Gene expression analysis identified 7 genes that were upregulated by both androgen and HIF1a.

In clinical datasets elevated expression of 5 of the 7 genes was associated with a poor prognosis.

    "abstract": "Plasmodium parasites undergo several major developmental transitions during their complex lifecycle, which are enabled by precisely ordered gene expression programs. Transcriptomes from the 48-hour blood stages of the major human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have been described using cDNA microarrays and RNA-seq, but these assays have not always performed well within non-coding regions, where the AT-content is often 90-95%. We developed a directional, amplification-free RNA-seq protocol (DAFT-seq) to reduce bias against AT-rich cDNA, which we have applied to three strains of P. falciparum (3D7, HB3 and IT). While strain-specific differences were detected, overall there is strong conservation between the transcriptional profiles. For the 3D7 reference strain, transcription was detected from 89% of the genome, with over 75% of the genome transcribed into mRNAs. These datasets allowed us to refine the 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs), which can be variable, long (>1,000 nt), and often overlap those of adjacent transcripts. We also find that transcription from bidirectional promoters frequently results in non-coding, antisense transcripts. By capturing the 5 ends of mRNAs, we reveal both constant and dynamic use of transcriptional start sites across the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle resulting in an updated view of the P. falciparum transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Speciation is usually a gradual process, in which reproductive barriers between two species accumulate over time. Reproductive traits, like genital morphology and mating behaviour, are some of the fastest diverging characters and can serve as reproductive barriers. The free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano, an established model for studying sex in hermaphrodites, and its congener M. janickei are closely related, but differ substantially in their male intromittent organ (stylet) morphology. Here, we examine whether these morphological differences are accompanied by differences in behavioural traits, and whether these could represent barriers to successful mating and hybridization between the two species. Our data shows that the two species differ in many aspects of their mating behaviour, with M. janickei having a five-fold longer copulation duration, copulating less frequently, and having a longer and more delayed suck behaviour (a postcopulatory behaviour likely involved in sexual conflict). Interestingly, and despite these significant morphological and behavioural differences, the two species mate readily with each other in heterospecific pairings, often showing behaviours of intermediate duration. Although both species have similar fecundity in conspecific pairings, the heterospecific pairings revealed clear postmating barriers, as only few heterospecific pairings produced F1 hybrids. These hybrids had a stylet morphology that was intermediate between that of the parental species, and they could successfully backcross to both parental species. Finally, in a mate choice experiment we tested if the worms preferentially mated with conspecifics over heterospecifics, since such a preference could represent a premating barrier. Interestingly, the experiment showed that the nearly two-fold higher mating rate of M. lignano caused it to mate more with conspecifics, leading to assortative mating, while M. janickei ended up mating more with heterospecifics. Thus, while the two species can hybridize, the mating rate differences could possibly lead to higher fitness costs for M. janickei compared to M. lignano.",

    "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a leading cell therapy candidate for the treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases due to their potent regulation of immune cells. MSC expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) upon interferon gamma exposure has been proposed as both a sentinel marker and key mediator of MSC immunomodulatory potency. Rather than wait for in vivo exposure to cytokines, MSCs can be pre-licensed during manufacturing to enhance IDO expression. In this study, we systematically examine the relative role the dose of interferon gamma, the duration of pre-licensing, and the donor of origin plays in dictating MSC production of functional IDO. We find that across three human MSC donors, MSCs increase their expression of IDO in response to both increased dose of interferon gamma and duration of pre-licensing. However, with extended pre-licensing, the expression of IDO no longer predicts MSCs ability to suppress activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, pre-licensing dose and duration are revealed to be minor modifiers of MSCs inherent potency, and thus cannot be manipulated to boost poor donors to the levels of high-performing donors. Thus, the dose and duration of pre-licensing should be tailored to optimize performance of specific donors and an emphasis on donor selection is needed to realize significant benefits of pre-licensing.",

    "abstract": "A-tracts are A:T rich DNA sequences that exhibit unique structural and mechanical properties associated with several functions in vivo. The crystallographic structure of A-tracts has been well characterized. However, their response to forces remains unknown and the variability of their flexibility reported for different length scales has precluded a comprehensive description of the mechanical properties of these molecules. Here, we rationalize the mechanical properties of A-tracts across multiple length scales using a combination of single-molecule experiments and theoretical polymer models applied to DNA sequences present in the C. elegans genome. Atomic Force Microscopy imaging shows that phased A-tracts induce long-range ([~]200 nm) bending. Moreover, the enhanced bending originates from an intrinsically bent structure rather than as a consequence of larger flexibility. In support of this, our data were well described with a theoretical model based on the worm-like chain model that includes intrinsic bending. Magnetic tweezers experiments confirm that the observed bent is intrinsic to the sequence and does not rely on particular ionic conditions. Using optical tweezers, we assess the local rigidity of A-tracts at high forces and unravel an unusually stiff character of these sequences, as quantified by their large stretch modulus. Our work rationalizes the complex multiscale flexibility of A-tracts, shedding light on the cryptic character of these sequences.",

We have shown in a nonhuman primate (NHP) HSC gene therapy and transplantation model that the CD34+CD90+ cell fraction was exclusively responsible for multilineage engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution. Here we show the translational potential of this HSC-enriched CD34 subset for lentivirus-mediated gene therapy. Alternative HSC-enrichment strategies include the purification of CD133+ cells or CD38low/- subsets of CD34+ cells from human blood products. We directly compared these strategies to the isolation of CD90+ cells using a GMP-grade flow-sorting protocol with clinical applicability. We show that CD90+ cell selection results in 40-fold fewer target cells in comparison to CD133+ or CD38low/- CD34 subsets without compromising the engraftment potential in vivo. Single cell RNA sequencing confirmed nearly complete depletion of lineage committed progenitor cells in CD90+ fractions compared to alternative selections. Importantly, lentiviral transduction efficiency in purified CD90+ cells resulted in up to 3-fold higher levels of engrafted gene-modified blood cells. These studies should have important implications for the manufacturing of patient-specific HSC gene therapy and genome editing products.",

    "abstract": "The use of molecular methods to identify the sex of elephants from non-invasive samples is essential for studies of population dynamics and population genetics. We designed a new technique for sex identification in savannah elephants using Amelogenin (AMEL) genes. The X-Y homologs of AMEL genes is known to be suitable for sex determination in pigs and some bovids. In this study on savannah elephants, the use of AMEL genes was more successful than previous methods that relied on genes found exclusively on Y-chromosomes, such as SRY, to distinguish males from females. We designed a common forward primer and two reverse primers for X- and Y-specific AMEL genes to obtain 262 bp and 196 bp PCR amplicons from X and Y genes, respectively. We tested the primers for the identification of the sex of 132 savannah elephants from fecal samples. The sex of 126 individuals (95.45%) matched observational data, while 6 (4.54%) did not match. This discrepancy observed was likely due to observational errors in the field, where high grass reduces the ability to accurately sex young individuals. Through our stool sample results, we have shown that the use of only three primers for AMELX/Y provides a highly accurate PCR-based method for sex identification in savannah elephants. The method is fast and shows more success than the SRY system by avoiding the inherent ambiguities of the previous PCR-based methods that made it difficult to distinguish between female samples and failed amplification reactions. Our sex identification method is non-invasive and can potentially be applied in population genetic studies and forensics tests on both savannah as well as forest elephants.",

    "abstract": "There is a need to understand the histopathological basis of MRI signal characteristics in complex biological matter. Microstructural imaging holds promise for sensitive and specific indicators of the early stages of human neurodegeneration but requires validation against traditional histological markers before it can be reliably applied in the clinical setting. Validation relies on a precise and preferably automatic method to align MRI and histological images of the same tissue, which poses unique challenges compared to more conventional MRI-to-MRI registration.\n\nA customisable open-source platform, Tensor Image Registration Library (TIRL) is presented. Based on TIRL, a fully automated pipeline was implemented to align small stained histological images with dissection photographs of corresponding tissue blocks and coronal brain slices, and further with high-resolution (0.5 mm) whole-brain post-mortem MRI data. The pipeline performed three separate deformable registrations to achieve accurate mapping between whole-brain MRI and small-slide histology coordinates. The robustness and accuracy of the individual registration steps were evaluated using both simulated data and real-life images from 6 different anatomical locations of one post-mortem human brain.\n\nThe automated registration method demonstrated sub-millimetre accuracy in all steps, robustness against tissue damage, and good reproducibility between experiments. The method also outperformed manual landmark-based slice-to-volume registration, also correcting for curvatures in the slicing plane. Due to the customisability of TIRL, the pipeline can be conveniently adapted for other research needs and is therefore suitable for the large-scale comparison of routinely collected histology and MRI data.\n\nHighlightsO_LITIRL: new framework for prototyping bespoke image registration pipelines\nC_LIO_LIPipeline for automated registration of small-slide histology to whole-brain MRI\nC_LIO_LISlice-to-volume registration accounting for through-plane deformations\nC_LIO_LINo need for serial histological sampling\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We propose the \"study strap ensemble,\" which combines advantages of two common approaches to fitting prediction models when multiple training datasets (\"studies\") are available: pooling studies and fitting one model versus averaging predictions from multiple models each fit to individual studies. The study strap ensemble fits models to bootstrapped datasets, or \"pseudo-studies.\" These are generated by resampling from multiple studies with a hierarchical resampling scheme that generalizes the randomized cluster bootstrap. The study strap is controlled by a tuning parameter that determines the proportion of observations to draw from each study. When the parameter is set to its lowest value, each pseudo-study is resampled from only a single study. When it is high, the study strap ignores the multi-study structure and generates pseudo-studies by merging the datasets and drawing observations like a standard bootstrap. We empirically show the optimal tuning value often lies in between, and prove that special cases of the study strap draw the merged dataset and the set of original studies as pseudo-studies. We extend the study strap approach with an ensemble weighting scheme that utilizes information in the distribution of the covariates of the test dataset.\n\nOur work is motivated by neuroscience experiments using real-time neurochemical sensing during awake behavior in humans. Current techniques to perform this kind of research require measurements from an electrode placed in the brain during awake neurosurgery and rely on prediction models to estimate neurotransmitter concentrations from the electrical measurements recorded by the electrode. These models are trained by combining multiple datasets that are collected in vitro under heterogeneous conditions in order to promote accuracy of the models when applied to data collected in the brain. A prevailing challenge is deciding how to combine studies or ensemble models trained on different studies to enhance model generalizability.\n\nOur methods produce marked improvements in simulations and in this application.

We compared STing to six of the most widely used programs for genome-based molecular typing and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy, speed, and efficiency. STing shows superior accuracy and performance for standard multilocus sequence typing schemes, along with larger genome-scale typing schemes, and it enables rapid automated detection of antimicrobial resistance and virulence factor genes.

We performed RNA-Seq and histone mark ChIP-Seq to define the transcriptomes and epigenomes of cells representing key developmental stages of HSC ontogeny in the mouse. The five populations analyzed were embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) endothelium and hemogenic endothelium from the major arteries (dorsal aorta, umbilical and vitelline), an enriched population of pre-hematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs), fetal liver HSCs, and adult bone marrow HSCs. We observed dynamic and combinatorial epigenetic changes that mark regulatory DNA sequences including gene promoters and enhancers. Using epigenetic signatures, we identified enhancers for each developmental stage. Only 12% of enhancers are primed, and 78% are active, suggesting the vast majority of enhancers are established de novo at the developmental stages where they are required to control their target genes, without prior priming in earlier stages. We constructed developmental-stage-specific transcriptional regulatory networks during HSC ontogeny by linking enhancers and predicted bound transcription factors to their target promoters using a novel computational algorithm. Our computational analyses predicted known transcriptional regulators for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, validating our overall approach, and identified putative novel transcription factors whose regulon activities correlate with the emergence of pre-HSCs. We validated roles for the broadly expressed transcription factors SP3 and MAZ in arterial hemogenic endothelium.

    "abstract": "Humans can rapidly encode information from faces to support social judgments and facilitate interactions with others. We can also recall complex knowledge about those individuals, such as their social relationships with others, but the timecourse of this process has not been examined in detail. This study addressed the temporal dynamics of emerging visual and social relationship information using electroencephalography (EEG) and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Participants became familiar with a 10-person social network, and were then shown faces of that networks members while EEG was recorded. To examine the temporal dynamics of the cognitive processes related to face perception, we compared the similarity structure of neural pattern responses to models of visual processing, face shape similarity, person identity, and social connectedness. We found that all types of information are associated with neural patterns after a face is seen. Visual and identity models became significant early after image onset, but only the identity model stayed associated with neural patterns until 400 ms. Models representing social connections were also present beginning around 200 ms, even in the absence of an explicit task to think about the friendships among the network members. A partial correlation showed that visual and social information contribute uniquely to person perception, although differences were found between models of social connection. This study highlights the speed and salience of social information relating to group dynamics that are present in the brain during person perception.\n\nSignificance StatementWe live our lives in social groups where complex relationships form among and around us. It is likely that some of the information about social relationships that we observe is integral during person perception, to better help us interact in differing situations with a variety of people. However, when exactly this information becomes relevant has been unclear. In this study, we present evidence that information reflecting observed relationships among a social network is spontaneously represented in whole-brain patterns shortly following visual perception, and is uniquely present around 400 ms. These results are consistent with neuroimaging studies showing spontaneous spatial representation of social network characteristics, and contribute novel insights into the timing of these neural processes.",

The long non-motor prodromal phase of PD is a window of opportunity for early detection and intervention. However, we lack the pathophysiological understanding to develop selective biomarkers and interventions. By developing a mutant -synuclein selective-overexpression mouse model of prodromal PD, we identified a cell-autonomous selective Kv4 channelopathy in dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) neurons. This functional remodeling of intact DMV neurons leads to impaired pacemaker function in vitro and in vivo, which in turn reduces gastrointestinal motility which is a common, very early symptom of prodromal PD. We show for the first time a causal chain of events from -synuclein via a biophysical dysfunction of specific neuronal populations to a clinically relevant prodromal symptom. These findings can facilitate the rational design of clinical biomarkers to identify people at risk for PD.",

Participants (n = 20) reached for and transport a jar under three conditions: one control condition and two self-talk conditions aimed at eliciting either task-unrelated verbal processing or task-related conscious control, while 32-channel EEG and kinematics were recorded. Compared to the control condition, both self-talk conditions elicited greater self-reported levels of verbal processing, but only the task-related self-talk condition was accompanied by greater left temporal activity (i.e., EEG alpha power decreased) during movement production. However, this increase was not localised to the left temporal region but was rather evident over all scalp regions examined, suggesting an interpretation more consistent with diminished neural efficiency. No effects for left temporal-frontal (T7-Fz) connectivity were detected across conditions. Our results failed to endorse left-temporal EEG alpha activity as valid index of verbal-analytic processing during motor tasks.",

This results in very limited diagnostic values of general physical examination.

We revealed rich relevant between PEIs in healthy physical status (7,662 significant correlations, 31.5% of all). However, in disease conditions, the PEI correlations changed. We further focused on the difference of these PEIs between healthy and 35 unhealthy physical status, 1,239 significant PEI difference were discovered suggesting as candidate disease markers. Finally, we established machine learning algorithms to predict the health status by using 15%-16% PEIs by feature extraction, which reached 66%-99% precision predictions depending on the physical state. This new encyclopedia of PEI correlation provides rich information to chronic disease diagnosis. Our developed machine learning algorithms will have fundamental impact in practice of general physical examination.",

However, the net effects of climate-driven species redistribution on local assemblage diversity remain unknown. Here, we relate trends in species richness and abundance from 21,500 terrestrial and marine assemblage time series across temperate regions (23.5-60.0{degrees}) to changes in air or sea surface temperature. We find a strong coupling between biodiversity and temperature changes in the marine realm, which is conditional on the baseline climate. We detect increases in species richness with increasing temperature that is twice as pronounced in warmer locations, while abundance declines with warming in the warmest marine locations. In contrast, we did not detect systematic temperature-related richness or abundance trends on land, despite a greater magnitude of warming. We also found no evidence for an interaction between biodiversity change and latitude, further emphasizing the importance of baseline climate in structuring assemblages. As the world is committed to further warming, significant challenges remain in maintaining local biodiversity amongst the non-uniform inflow and outflow of \"climate migrants\" across distinct regions, especially in the ocean.",

    "abstract": "The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components such as transposable elements (TEs). Because the types and sequences of TEs are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, a new pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This new program brings substantial improvements over the original version of RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete LTR retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated TE libraries: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Oryza sativa (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified approximately three times more consensus sequences matching with >95% sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is for LTR retroelements. The program had an extremely low false positive rate when applied to simulated genomes devoid of TEs. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences. RepeatModeler2 is available as source code or a containerized package under an open license (https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler, https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/TETools).\n\nSignificanceGenome sequences are being produced for more and more eukaryotic species. The bulk of these genomes is composed of parasitic, self-mobilizing transposable elements (TEs) that play important roles in organismal evolution. Thus there is a pressing need for developing software that can accurately identify the diverse set of TEs dispersed in genome sequences. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, an easy-to-use package for the curation of reference TE libraries which can be applied to any eukaryotic species. Through several major improvements over the previous version, RepeatModeler2 is able to produce libraries that recapitulate the known composition of three model species with some of the most complex TE landscapes. Thus RepeatModeler2 will greatly enhance the discovery and annotation of TEs in genome sequences.",

Here we present a novel approach that combines SIMS with a mechanistic model to reveal otherwise inaccessible nutrient kinetics. The method is applied to study the onset of a synthetic mutualistic partnership between a vitamin B12-dependent mutant of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the B12-producing, heterotrophic bacterium Mesorhizobium loti, which is supported by algal photosynthesis. Results show that an initial pool of fixed carbon delays the onset of mutualistic cross-feeding, and the model allows quantification of this delay. Our method is widely applicable to other microbial systems, and will contribute to furthering a mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions.",

How these kinases bind to cellular factors and how this impacts their regulatory functions is poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative proteomics to determine cellular interaction partners of human herpesvirus (HHV) kinases. We find that these kinases can target key regulators of transcription and replication. The interaction with Cyclin A and associated factors is identified as a specific signature of {beta}-herpesvirus kinases. Cyclin A is recruited via RXL-motifs that overlap with nuclear localization signals (NLS) and locate in the non-catalytic N-terminal regions. This architecture is conserved for viral kinases of HHV6, HHV7 and rodent CMVs. Docking to Cyclin A competes with NLS function, enabling dynamic changes in kinase localization and substrate phosphorylation. The viral kinase redirects Cyclin A to the cytosol, which is essential for the inhibition of cellular DNA replication during infection. Our data highlight a fine-tuned and physiologically important interplay between a cellular cyclin and viral kinases.",

Secondly, we studied the effects of heavy metal exposure in a population close to a copper smelter, where birds suffer from pollution-related decrease in food quality. For both comparisons, the analysis of about million CpGs covering most of the annotated genes, revealed that regions enriched for developmental processes showed pollution-related changes in DNA methylation, but the results were not consistent with binomial and beta binomial regression. Our study indicates that post-natal anthropogenic heavy metal exposure can affect methylation levels of development related genes in a wild bird population.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLocal phosphatase regulation is critical for determining when phosphorylation signals are activated or deactivated. A typical example is the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis, which regulates kinetochore PP1 and PP2A-B56 activities to switch-off signalling events at the correct time. In this case, kinetochore phosphatase activation dephosphorylates MELT motifs on KNL1 to remove SAC proteins, including the BUB complex. We show here that, surprisingly, neither PP1 or PP2A are required to dephosphorylate the MELT motifs. Instead, they remove polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) from the BUB complex, which can otherwise maintain MELT phosphorylation in an autocatalytic manner. This is their principle role in the SAC, because both phosphatases become redundant if PLK1 is inhibited or BUB-PLK1 interaction is prevented. Therefore, phosphatase regulation is critical for the SAC, but primarily to restrain and extinguish autonomous kinase activity. We propose that these circuits have evolved to generate a semi-autonomous SAC signal that can be synchronously silenced following kinetochore-microtubule tension.",

    "abstract": "AimThe tribe Antirrhineae, including snapdragons, toadflaxes and relatives, is a model group for plant evolutionary research. It is widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere and the Neotropics, but displays an uneven distribution of diversity, with more than 50% of species and subspecies in the Mediterranean Region. Here we conducted the first detailed, worldwide biogeographic analysis of the Antirrhineae and tested two alternative hypotheses (time-for-speciation vs. diversification rate differences) to explain the uneven distribution of diversity.\n\nLocationWorldwide, with a focus on the Mediterranean Region.\n\nTaxontribe Antirrhineae (Plantaginaceae).\n\nMethodsA phylogenetic biogeographic approach was taken, accounting for area connections through time. Ancestral ranges, dispersal events, speciation and lineage accumulation within areas were estimated. Diversification rates for taxa present and absent in the Mediterranean Region were compared, accounting for the effect of a floral key innovation (nectar spur).\n\nResultsA proto-Mediterranean origin in the Late Eocene was estimated, and the Mediterranean Region stood out as the main centre for speciation and dispersal. Congruent patterns of long-distance dispersal from the Mediterranean Region to North America were recovered for at least two amphiatlantic clades. A significant floristic exchange between the Mediterranean and south-western Asia was detected. We found no evidence of different diversification rates between lineages inside and outside the Mediterranean Region.\n\nMain conclusionsThe Mediterranean Region played a key role in the origin of the current distribution of the Antirrhineae. However, the higher species richness found in this region appears to be the result of a time-for-speciation effect rather than of increased diversification rates. The establishment of current mediterranean climates in the Northern Hemisphere appears to have contributed to the recent diversification of the group, in combination with colonisation of adjacent regions with arid and semi-arid climates.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor for glaucoma and recent work has demonstrated critical early neuroinflammatory insults occur in the optic nerve head following ocular hypertension. Microglia and infiltrating monocytes are likely candidates to drive these neuroinflammatory insults. However, the exact molecular identity / transcriptomic profile of microglia early following ocular hypertensive insults is unknown. To elucidate the molecular identity of microglia during early glaucoma pathogenesis, we performed RNA-sequencing of microglia mRNA from the optic nerve head of a genetic mouse model of glaucoma (DBA/2J) at a time point following ocular hypertensive insults, but preceding detectable neurodegeneration (with microglia identified as being CD45lo/CD11b+/CD11c-). Furthermore, RNA-sequencing was performed on optic nerve head microglia from mice treated with radiation therapy, a potent therapy preventing neuroinflammatory insults. Transcriptomic profiling of optic nerve head microglia mRNA identifies early metabolic priming with marked changes in mitochondrial gene expression, and changes to phagocytosis, inflammatory, and sensome pathways. The data predict that many functions of microglia that help maintain tissue homeostasis are affected. Comparative analysis of these data with data from previously published whole optic nerve head tissue or monocyte-only samples from DBA/2J mice demonstrate that many of the neuroinflammatory signatures in these data sets arise from infiltrating monocytes and not reactive microglia. Finally, our data demonstrate that radiation therapy of DBA/2J mice potently abolishes these microglia metabolic transcriptomic changes at the same time points. Together, our data provide a unique resource for the community to help drive further hypothesis generation and testing in glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStable genetic transformation of plants is a low-efficiency process, and identification of positive transformants usually relies on screening for expression of a co-transformed marker gene. Often this involves germinating seeds on solid media containing a selection reagent. Germination on solid media requires surface sterilization of seeds and careful aseptic technique to prevent microbial contamination, but surface sterilization techniques are time consuming and can cause seed mortality if not performed carefully. We developed an antimicrobial cocktail that can be added to solid media to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth without impairing germination, allowing us to bypass the surface sterilization step.\n\nResultsAdding a combination of terbinafine (1 {micro}M) and timentin (200 mg/L) to solid media delayed the onset of observable microbial growth and did not affect germination of non-sterile seeds from ten different wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. The method was also compatible with Nicotiana tabacum germination. Seedlings sown in non-sterile conditions could be maintained on antimicrobial media for up to a week without observable contamination. The antimicrobial cocktail was compatible with rapid screening methods for hygromycin B, phosphinothricin (BASTA) and nourseothricin resistance genes, meaning that positive transformants can be identified from non-sterile seeds in as little as four days after stratification and transferred to soil before the onset of visible microbial contamination.\n\nConclusionThe antimicrobial cocktail presented here delays microbial growth for long enough to permit germination of non-sterile Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings on solid media and it is compatible with rapid screening methods. We were able to select genetic transformants on solid media without seed surface sterilization, eliminating a tedious and time-consuming step.",

We present a method for the generation of beating cardiomyocytes expressing specific ventricular markers after just 14 days.

Increased MLC2V expression was also accompanied by a slower beating rate (49.4 {+/-} 1.53 vs. 93.0 {+/-} 2.81 beats per minute, p <0.0001) and increased contraction amplitude (201% {+/-} 8.33% vs. 100% {+/-} 10.85%, p <0.0001) compared to untreated cells.

    "abstract": "Organisms that live in deserts offer the opportunity to investigate how species adapt to environmental conditions that are lethal to most plants and animals. In the hot deserts of North America, high temperatures and lack of water are conspicuous challenges for organisms living there. The cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus) displays several adaptations to these conditions, including low metabolic rate, heat tolerance, and the ability to maintain homeostasis under extreme dehydration. To investigate the genomic basis of desert adaptation in cactus mice, we built a chromosome-level genome assembly and resequenced 26 additional cactus mouse genomes from two locations in southern California (USA). Using these data, we integrated comparative, population, and functional genomic approaches. We identified 16 gene families exhibiting significant contractions or expansions in the cactus mouse compared to 17 other Myodontine rodent genomes, and found 232 sites across the genome associated with selective sweeps. Functional annotations of candidate gene families and selective sweeps revealed a pervasive signature of selection at genes involved in the synthesis and degradation of proteins, consistent with the evolution of cellular mechanisms to cope with protein denaturation caused by thermal and hyperosmotic stress. Other strong candidate genes included receptors for bitter taste, suggesting a dietary shift towards chemically defended desert plants and insects, and a growth factor involved in lipid metabolism, potentially involved in prevention of dehydration. Understanding how species adapted to the recent emergence of deserts in North America will provide an important foundation for predicting future evolutionary responses to increasing temperatures, droughts and desertification in the cactus mouse and other species.",

The basal ganglia, especially the caudate nucleus \"head\" (CDh) of the striatum, receive indirect anatomical connections from the superior colliculus, a midbrain structure that is known to play a crucial role in the control of visual attention. To test the possible functional relationship between these subcortical structures, we recorded CDh neuronal activity before and during unilateral SC inactivation in a spatial attention task. SC inactivation significantly altered the attention-related modulation of CDh neurons and strongly impaired the classification of task epochs based on CDh activity. Only inactivation of the same-side of SC as recorded CDh neurons, not the opposite-side, had these effects. These results demonstrate a novel interaction between SC activity and attention-related visual processing in the basal ganglia.",

With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or \"species\", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts.",

    "abstract": "Colour pattern has been long recognised as the trait that drives mate recognition between Heliconius species that are phylogenetically close. However, when this cue is compromised such as in cases of mimetic, sympatric and closely related species, alternative mating signals must evolve to ensure reproductive isolation and species integrity. The closely related species Heliconius melpomene malleti and H. timareta florencia, occur in the same geographic region and despite being co-mimics they display strong reproductive isolation. In order to test which cues differ between species, and therefore potentially contribute to reproductive isolation, we quantified differences in wing phenotype and male chemical profile. As expected, wing colour pattern was indistinguishable between the two species while the chemical profile of their male sex pheromones showed marked differences. We then conducted behavioural experiments to study the importance of these signals in mate recognition by females. In agreement with our previous results, we found that pheromones and not wing colour pattern drive the preference of females by conspecific males. In addition, experiments with hybrid males and females suggested an important genetic component for both pheromone production and preference. Altogether, these results suggest that pheromones are the major reproductive barrier opposing gene flow between these two sister and co-mimic species.",

    "abstract": "The chloroplast genome harbors plenty of valuable information for phylogenetic research. Illumina short-read data is generally used for de novo assembly of whole plastomes. PacBio or Oxford Nanopore long reads are additionally employed in hybrid approaches to enable assembly across the highly similar inverted repeats of a chloroplast genome. Unlike for PacBio, plastome assemblies based solely on Nanopore reads are rarely found, due to their high error rate and non-random error profile. However, the actual quality decline connected to their use has never been quantified. Furthermore, no study has employed reference-based assembly using Nanopore reads, which is common with Illumina data. Using Leucanthemum Mill. as an example, we compared the sequence quality of seven plastome assemblies of the same species, using combinations of two sequencing platforms and three analysis pipelines. In addition, we assessed the factors which might influence Nanopore assembly quality during sequence generation and bioinformatic processing.\n\nThe consensus sequence derived from de novo assembly of Nanopore data had a sequence identity of 99.59% compared to Illumina short-read de novo assembly. Most of the found errors comprise indels (81.5%), and a large majority of them is part of homopolymer regions. The quality of reference-based assembly is heavily dependent upon the choice of a close-enough reference. Using a reference with 0.83% sequence divergence from the studied species, mapping of Nanopore reads results in a consensus comparable to that from Nanopore de novo assembly, and of only slightly inferior quality compared to a reference-based assembly with Illumina data (0.49% and 0.26% divergence from Illumina de novo). For optimal assembly of Nanopore data, appropriate filtering of contaminants and chimeric sequences, as well as employing moderate read coverage, is essential.\n\nBased on these results, we conclude that Nanopore long reads are a suitable alternative to Illumina short reads in plastome phylogenomics. Only few errors remain in the finalized assembly, which can be easily masked in phylogenetic analyses without loss in analytical accuracy. The easily applicable and cost-effective technology might warrant more attention by researchers dealing with plant chloroplast genomes.",

    "abstract": "Humans are unique in the animal world in the extent to which we have the potential to affect our own biological evolution through culturally mediated behavioural variation. However, there is scant clear evidence of the phenomenon. Here, I estimate genetic diversity for every county in the US by merging demographic data from the 2010 US Census with genomic reference populations and show that genetic diversity is predicted by cultural variation as reflected by the 2016 Presidential Election. Remarkably, the 2016 Election alone explains 18% of US county-level variation in genetic diversity, with diversity decreasing as Trump support increases. When state level variation is included in the model, 71% of variation is explained. Within states, genetic segregation increases with cultural segregation. I then tested whether the observed genetic patterns might be explained by culture acting on race and ethnicity and found that genetic diversity tends to increase with racial and ethnic diversity, and that the 2016 Election is an even better predictor of the US landscape of ethnic diversity. Finally, I measured patterns of ethnic assortative mating nationwide from the Census data, and found that ethnic assortment is primarily explained by the proportion of minorities in each county, and that the most diverse counties are the most assortative. Overall, regional variation in cultural tolerance appears to be structuring biological diversity on a massive scale. Also, assortative mating is maintaining ethnic and genetic diversity within the most diverse and tolerant areas. Culture is a primary driver of biological evolution across the US.",

Despite being successful in vitro and in vivo, HAPs are yet to achieve successful results in clinical settings. It has been hypothesised that this lack of clinical success can, in part, be explained by the insufficiently stringent clinical screening selection of determining which tumours are suitable for HAP treatments.\n\nTaking a mathematical modelling approach, we investigate how tumour properties and HAP-radiation scheduling influence treatment outcomes in simulated tumours. The following key results are demonstrated in silico: (i) HAP and ionising radiation (IR) monotherapies may attack tumours in dissimilar, and complementary, ways. (ii) HAP-IR scheduling may impact treatment efficacy. (iii) HAPs may function as IR treatment intensifiers. (iv) The spatio-temporal intra-tumoural oxygen landscape may impact HAP efficacy. Our in silico framework is based on an on-lattice, hybrid, multiscale cellular automaton spanning three spatial dimensions. The mathematical model for tumour spheroid growth is parameterised by multicellular tumour spheroid (MCTS) data.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhen cancer patients present with solid tumours, the tumours often contain regions that are oxygen-deprived or, in other words, hypoxic. Hypoxic cancer cells are more resistant to conventional anti-cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and therefore tumour hypoxia may complicate treatments. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs constitute a conceptually elegant approach to not only overcome, but better yet, exploit tumour hypoxia. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs are drugs that act as Trojan horses, they are theoretically harmless vehicles that are converted into warheads when they reach their targets: hypoxic tumour cells. Despite being conceptually clever and successful in experimental settings, hypoxia-activated prodrugs are yet to achieve successful results in clinical trials. It has been hypothesised that this lack of clinical success can, in part, be explained by an insufficiently stringent clinical screening selection of determining which tumours are suitable for hypoxia-activated prodrug treatments.\n\nIn this article, we investigate how simulated tumours with different oxygen landscapes respond to anti-cancer treatments that include hypoxia-activated prodrugs, either alone or in combination with radiotherapy. Our simulation framework is based on a mathematical model that describes how individual cancer cells in a tumour divide and respond to treatments. We demonstrate that the efficacy of hypoxia-activated prodrugs depends on both the treatment scheduling, and on the oxygen landscape of the specific, simulated tumour.",

    "abstract": "The evolution and diversification of animal reproductive modes have been pivotal questions in behavioral ecology. Amphibians present the highest diversity of reproductive modes among vertebrates, involving various behavioral, physiological and morphological traits. One of such features is the amplexus, the clasp or embrace of males on females during reproduction, which is almost universal to anurans. Hypotheses about the origin amplexus are limited and have not been thoroughly tested, nor had they taken into account evolutionary relationships in most comparative studies. However, these considerations are crucial to understand the evolution of reproductive modes. Here, using an evolutionary framework, we reconstruct the ancestral state of amplexus in 686 anuran species; investigate whether the amplexus type is a conserved trait; and test whether sexual size dimorphism (SSD) could have influenced the amplexus type or male performance while clasping females. Overall, we found evidence of at least 35 evolutionary transitions in amplexus type across anurans. We also found that amplexus exhibits a high phylogenetic signal (it is conserved across Anura evolutionary history) and the amplexus type does not evolve in association with SSD. We discuss the implications of our findings on the diversity of amplexus types across anurans.",

    "abstract": "Microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing complex cellular phenotypes, but linking these phenotypes to genotype or RNA expression at scale remains challenging. Here, we present Visual Cell Sorting, a method that physically separates hundreds of thousands of live cells based on their visual phenotype. Visual Cell Sorting uses automated imaging and phenotypic analysis to direct selective illumination of Dendra2, a photoconvertible fluorescent protein expressed in live cells; these photoactivated cells are then isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. First, we use Visual Cell Sorting to assess the effect of hundreds of nuclear localization sequence variants in a pooled format, identifying variants that improve nuclear localization and enabling annotation of nuclear localization sequences in thousands of human proteins. Second, we use Visual Cell Sorting to recover cells that retain normal nuclear morphologies after paclitaxel treatment, then derive their single cell transcriptomes to identify multiple pathways associated with paclitaxel resistance in human cancers. Unlike alternative methods, Visual Cell Sorting depends on inexpensive reagents and commercially available hardware. As such, it can be readily deployed to uncover the relationships between visual cellular phenotypes and internal states, including genotypes and gene expression programs.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondria of flowering plants have large and complex genomes whose structure and segregation are modulated by recombination activities. The late steps of mitochondrial recombination are still poorly characterized: while the loss of mitochondrial recombination is not viable, a deficiency in RECG1-dependent branch migration has little impact on plant development, implying the existence of alternative pathways. Here we present RADA, an ortholog of bacterial RadA/Sms, which is required for the processing of organellar recombination intermediates. While bacterial RadA is dispensable, RADA-deficient plants are severely impacted in their development and fertility, correlating with increased mtDNA ectopic recombination and replication of recombination-generated subgenomes. The radA mutation is epistatic to recG1, indicating that RADA drives the main branch migration pathway of plant mitochondria. In contrast, the double mutation radA recA3 is lethal, underlining the importance of an alternative RECA3-dependent pathway. Although RADA is dually targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts, we found little to no effects of radA on the stability of the plastidial genome. The stunted growth of radA mutants could not be correlated with obvious defects in mitochondrial gene expression. Rather, it seems that is partially caused by a retrograde signal that activates nuclear genes repressing cell cycle progression.",

Here we consider a mathematical model with bursty production of protein, a one-step production delay (the passage of which activates the protein), and feedback in the frequency of bursts. We specifically focus on examining the steady-state behaviour of the model in the slow-activation (i.e. large-delay) regime. Using a quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation, we derive an autonomous ordinary differential equation for the inactive protein that applies in the slow-activation regime. If the differential equation is monostable, the steady-state distribution of the inactive (active) protein is approximated by a single Gaussian (Poisson) mode located at the globally stable steady state of the differential equation. If the differential equation is bistable (due to cooperative positive feedback), the steady-state distribution of the inactive (active) protein is approximated by a mixture of Gaussian (Poisson) modes located at the stable steady states; the weights of the modes are determined from a WKB approximation to the stationary distribution. The asymptotic results are compared to numerical solutions of the chemical master equation.",

These inferences rely on rates of substitution in the mtDNA genes that, ideally, are specific for the studied taxa. But as such values are often unavailable many studies fixed rate values generalised from other studies, such as the popular \"standard molecular clock\". However the validity of these universal rates across all bird lineages and for the different mtDNA has been severely questioned. Thus, we here performed the most comprehensive calibration of the mtDNA molecular clock in birds, with the inclusion of complete mitochondrial genomes for 622 bird species and 25 reliable fossil calibrations. The results show variation in the rates between lineages and especially between markers, contradicting the universality of the standard clock. Moreover, we provide especific rates for every mtDNA marker (except D-loop) in each of the sampled avian orders, which should help improve future estimations of divergence times between bird species or populations.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) by anammox bacteria contributes significantly to the global nitrogen cycle, and plays a major role in sustainable wastewater treatment. Anammox bacteria convert ammonium (NH4+) to dinitrogen gas (N2) using nitrite (NO2-) or nitric oxide (NO) as the electron acceptor. In the absence of NO2- or NO, anammox bacteria can couple formate oxidation to the reduction of metal oxides such as Fe(III) or Mn(IV). Their genomes contain homologs of Geobacter and Shewanella cytochromes involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET). However, it is still unknown whether anammox bacteria have EET capability and can couple the oxidation of NH4+ with transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors. Here we show using complementary approaches that in the absence of NO2-, freshwater and marine anammox bacteria couple the oxidation of NH4+ with transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors such as graphene oxide (GO) or electrodes poised at a certain potential in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). Metagenomics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization and electrochemical analyses coupled with MEC performance confirmed that anammox electrode biofilms were responsible for current generation through EET-dependent oxidation of NH4+. 15N-labelling experiments revealed the molecular mechanism of the EET-dependent anammox process. NH4+ was oxidized to N2 via hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as intermediate when electrode was the terminal electron acceptor. Comparative transcriptomics analysis supported isotope labelling experiments and revealed an alternative pathway for NH4+ oxidation coupled to EET when electrode is used as electron acceptor compared to NO2-as electron acceptor. To our knowledge, our results provide the first experimental evidence that marine and freshwater anammox bacteria can couple NH4+ oxidation with EET, which is a significant finding, and challenges our perception of a key player of anaerobic oxidation of NH4+ in natural environments and engineered systems.",

    "abstract": "Corn (Zea mays L.) is not only an important food source, but also has numerous uses, including for biofuels, fillers for cosmetics, glues, and so on. The amount of corn grown in the U.S. has significantly increased since the 1960s and with it, the demand for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides/fungicides to enhance its production. However, the downside of the continuous use of these products, especially N and P fertilizers, has been an increase in N2O emissions and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as well as run-off into waterways that fuel pollution and algal blooms. These approaches to agriculture, especially if exacerbated by climate change, will result in decreased soil health as well as human health. We searched for microbes from arid, native environments that are not being used for agriculture because we reasoned that indigenous microbes from such soils could promote plant growth and help restore degraded soils. Employing cultivation-dependent methods to isolate bacteria from the Negev Desert in Israel, we tested the effects of several microbial isolates on corn in both greenhouse and small field studies. One strain, Dietzia cinnamea 55, originally identified as Planomicrobium chinensis, significantly enhanced corn growth over the uninoculated control in both greenhouse and outside garden experiments. We sequenced and analyzed the genome of this bacterial species to elucidate some of the mechanisms whereby D. cinnamea 55 promoted plant growth. In addition, to ensure the biosafety of this previously unknown plant growth promoting bacterial (PGPB) strain as a potential bioinoculant, we tested the survival and growth of Caenorhabditis elegans (a test for virulence) in response to D. cinnamea 55. We also looked for genes for potential virulence determinants as well as for growth promotion.",

    "abstract": "The construction and function of virtually all cilia require the universally conserved process of Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) [1, 2]. During the atypically fast IFT in the green alga C. reinhardtii, up to ten kinesin-2 motors  line up in a tight assembly on the trains [3], provoking the question of how these motors coordinate their action to ensure smooth and fast transport along the flagellum without standing in each others way. Here, we show that the heterodimeric FLA8/10 kinesin-2 alone is responsible for the atypically fast IFT in C. reinhardtii. Notably, in single-molecule studies, FLA8/10 moved at speeds matching those of in vivo IFT [4], but additionally displayed a slow velocity distribution, indicative of auto-inhibition. Addition of the KAP subunit to generate the heterotrimeric FLA8/10/KAP relieved this inhibition, thus providing a mechanistic rationale for heterotrimerization with the KAP subunit in fully activating FLA8/10 for IFT in vivo. Finally, we link fast FLA8/10 and slow KLP11/20 kinesin-2 from C. reinhardtii and C. elegans through a DNA tether to understand the molecular underpinnings of motor coordination during IFT in vivo. For motor pairs from both species, the co-transport velocities very nearly matched the single-molecule velocities, and the complexes both spent roughly 80% of the time with only one of the two motors attached to the microtubule. Thus, irrespective of phylogeny and kinetic properties, kinesin-2 motors prefer to work alone without sacrificing efficiency. Our findings thus offer a simple mechanism for how efficient IFT is achieved across diverse organisms despite being carried out by motors with different properties.",

    "abstract": "Experiments on animal hearts (rat, rabbit, guinea pig, etc.) have demonstrated that mechano-calcium feedback (MCF) and mechano-electric feedback (MEF) are very important for myocardial self-regulation because they adjust the cardiomyocyte contractile function to various mechanical loads and to mechanical interactions between heterogeneous myocardial segments in the ventricle walls. In in vitro experiments on these animals, MCF and MEF manifested themselves in several basic classical phenomena (e.g. load dependence, length dependence of isometric twitches, etc.), and in the respective responses of calcium transients and action potentials. However, it is extremely difficult to study simultaneously the electrical, calcium, and mechanical activities of the human heart muscle in vitro. Mathematical modeling is a useful tool for exploring these phenomena. We have developed a novel model to describe electromechanical coupling and mechano-electric feedbacks in the human cardiomyocyte. It combines the  ten Tusscher - Panfilov electrophysiological model of the human cardiomyocyte with our module of myocardium mechanical activity taken from the  Ekaterinburg - Oxford model and adjusted to human data. Using it, we simulated isometric and afterloaded twitches and effects of MCF and MEF on excitation-contraction coupling. MCF and MEF were found to affect significantly the duration of the calcium transient and action potential in the human cardiomyocyte model in response to both smaller afterloads as compared to bigger ones and various mechanical interventions applied during isometric and afterloaded twitches.",

It has a particular tropism for the gravid uterus, however, the route of infection in reproductive tissues of ruminants (i.e. placentome), is much less clear. In this study, we aimed to investigate a bovine caruncular epithelial cell (BCEC) line as a model for L. monocytogenes infection of the bovine reproductive tract. The BCEC infection model was used to assess the ability of 14 different L. monocytogenes isolates to infect these cells. Lysozyme sensitivity and bacterial survival in 580 {micro}g lysozyme/ml correlated with attenuated ability to proliferate in BCEC (p=0.004 and p=0.02, respectively). Four isolates were significantly attenuated compared to the control strain 10403S. One of these strains (AR008) showed evidence of compromised cell wall leading to increased sensitivity to {beta}-lactam antibiotics, and another (7644) had compromised cell membrane integrity leading to increased sensitivity to cationic peptides. Whole genome sequencing followed by Multi Locus Sequence Type analysis identified that five invasive isolates had the same sequence type, ST59, despite originating from three different clinical conditions. Virulence gene analysis showed that the attenuated isolate LM4 was lacking two virulence genes (uhpT, virR) known to be involved in intracellular growth and virulence.\n\nIn conclusion, the BCEC model was able to differentiate between the infective potential of different isolates.

    "abstract": "Rhythmic activity has been associated with a wide range of cognitive processes including the encoding of sensory information, navigation, the transfer of emotional information and others. Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can facilitate the transfer of rhythmic activity downstream the information processing pathway. However, STDP has also been known to generate strong winner-take-all like competitions between subgroups of correlated synaptic inputs. Consequently, one might expect that STDP would induce strong competition between different rhythmicity channels thus preventing the multiplexing of information across different frequency channels. This study explored whether STDP facilitates the multiplexing of information across multiple frequency channels, and if so, under what conditions. We investigated the STDP dynamics in the framework of a model consisting of two competing sub-populations of neurons that synapse in a feedforward manner onto a single post-synaptic neuron. Each sub-population was assumed to oscillate in an independent manner and in a different frequency band. To investigate the STDP dynamics, a mean field Fokker-Planck theory was developed in the limit of the slow learning rate. Surprisingly, our theory predicted limited interactions between the different sub-groups. Our analysis further revealed that the interaction between these channels was mainly mediated by the shared component of the mean activity. Next, we generalized these results beyond the simplistic model using numerical simulations. We found that for a wide range of parameters, the system converged to a solution in which the post-synaptic neuron responded to both rhythms. Nevertheless, all the synaptic weights remained dynamic and did not converge to a fixed point. These findings imply that STDP can support the multiplexing of rhythmic information, and demonstrate how functionality (multiplexing of information) can be retained in the face of continuous remodeling of all the synaptic weights.",

We also evaluate the ability of DMS measurements and VEPs to discriminate between pathogenic and benign missense variants. We find that DMS experiments tend to be superior to the top-ranking predictors, demonstrating the tremendous potential of DMS for identifying novel human disease mutations. Among the VEPs, DeepSequence clearly stood out, showing both the strongest correlations with DMS data and having the best ability to predict pathogenic mutations, which is especially remarkable given that it is an unsupervised method.

Here, using crystallography, biophysical and biochemical analysis and live-cell imaging, we define the entry process of PyoS5 and reveal links to the transport mechanisms of other bacteriocins. In addition to its C-terminal pore-forming domain, elongated PyoS5 comprises two novel tandemly repeated kinked three helix bundle domains that structure-based alignments identify as key import domains in other pyocins. The central domain binds the lipid-bound common polysaccharide antigen, allowing the pyocin to accumulate on the cell surface. The N-terminal domain binds the ferric pyochelin transporter FptA while its associated disordered region binds the inner membrane protein TonB1, which together drive import of the bacteriocin across the outer membrane. Finally, we identify the minimal requirements for sensitizing Escherichia coli towards PyoS5, as well as other pyocins, and suggest that a generic pathway likely underpins the import of all TonB-dependent bacteriocins across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The cohesin complex plays a major role in folding the human genome into 3D structural domains. Mutations in members of the cohesin complex are known early drivers of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), with STAG2 the most frequently mutated complex member. Here we use functional genomics to investigate the impact of chronic STAG2 loss on three-dimensional genome structure and transcriptional programming in a clinically relevant model of chronic STAG2 loss. The chronic loss of STAG2 led to loss of smaller loop domains and the maintenance/formation of large domains which in turn led to altered genome compartmentalisation. These changes in genome structure were linked with altered gene expression, including deregulation of the HOXA locus and the MAPK signalling pathway, which may contribute to disease development and response to therapy.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal malignant diseases that affect the myeloid blood cell lineage. Around 40 different mutations have been identified as being associated with MDS and AML; several mutations effect genes in the cohesin complex particularly STAG2. STAG2 is an X-linked gene that is pivotal to the cohesin complex and the mutations result in a truncated gene and loss of function. We have introduced a clinically relevant truncating mutation into an isogeneic AML model. This has shown that changes in the sizes of loop and domains formed in the genome resulting in appropriate gene compartmentalisations. The associated changes in gene transcription has resulted in deregulation of HOX genes, essential for development and differentiation, and in the MAPK signalling pathway that could a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Across Eurasia and North America, beaver (Castor spp), their dams and their human-built analogues are becoming increasingly common restoration tools to facilitate recovery of streams and wetlands, providing a natural and cost-effective means of restoring dynamic fluvial ecosystems. Although the use of beaver ponds by numerous fish and wildlife species is well documented, debate continues as to the benefits of beaver dams, primarily because dams are perceived as barriers to the movement of fishes, particularly migratory species such as salmonids. In this study, through a series of field experiments, we tested the ability of juvenile salmonids to cross constructed beaver dams (aka beaver dam analogues). Two species, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (O. mykiss), were tracked using passive integrated transponder tags (PIT tags) as they crossed constructed beaver dams. We found that when we tagged and moved late-summer parr from immediately upstream of the dams to immediately downstream of them, most of them were detected upstream within 36 hours of displacement. By the end of a 21-day field experiment, 91% of the displaced juvenile coho and 54% of the juvenile steelhead trout were detected on antennas upstream of the dams while <1% of the coho and 15% of the steelhead trout were detected on antennas in the release pool below the dams. A similar but shorter 4-day pilot experiment with only steelhead trout produced similar results. In contrast, in a non-displacement experiment, juveniles of both species that were captured, tagged and released in a pool 50 m below the dams showed little inclination to move upstream. Finally by measuring hydraulic conditions at the major flowpaths over and around the dams, we provide insight into conditions under which juvenile salmonids are able to cross these constructed beaver dams, which should help guide future restoration efforts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRabies is a vaccine-preventable fatal zoonotic disease. Uganda, through the veterinary surveillance system at National Animal Disease Diagnostics and Epidemiology Centre (NADDEC), captures animal bites (a proxy for rabies) on a monthly basis from districts. We established trends of incidence of animal bites and corresponding post-exposure prophylactic anti-rabies vaccination in humans (PEP), associated mortality rates in humans, spatial distribution of animal bites, and pets vaccinated during 2013-2017.\n\nMethodsWe reviewed rabies surveillance data at NADDEC from 2013-2017. The surveillance system captures persons reporting bites by a suspected rabid dog/cat/wild animal, human deaths due to suspected rabies, humans vaccinated against rabies, and pets vaccinated. Number of total pets was obtained from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. We computed incidence of animal bites and corresponding PEP in humans, and analyzed overall trends, 2013-2017. We also examined human mortality rates and spatial distribution of animal bites/rabies and pets vaccinated against rabies.\n\nFindingsWe identified 8,240 persons reporting animal bites in Uganda during 2013-2017; overall incidence of 21 bites/100,000population. The incidence significantly decreased from 8.2/100,000 in 2013 to 1.1/100,000 in 2017 (OR=0.62, p= 0.0074). Of the 8,240 persons with animal bites, 6,799 (82.5%) received PEP, decreasing from 94% in 2013 to 71% in 2017 (OR=0.65, p<0.001). Among 1441 victims, who reportedly never received PEP, 156 (11%) died. Western region had a higher incidence of animal bites (37/100,000) compared to other regions. Only 5.6% (124,555/2,240,000) of all pets in Uganda were vaccinated. There was a decline in the reporting rate of animal bites.\n\nConclusionWhile reported animal bites decreased in Uganda, so did PEP among humans. Very few pets received anti-rabies vaccine. Evaluation of barriers to complete reporting may facilitate interventions to enhance surveillance quality. We recommended improved vaccination of pets against rabies, and immediate administration of exposed humans with PEP.\n\nAuthor SummaryRabies is a deadly viral disease, that is transmitted mainly by dog bites. Globally at least 59,000 deaths are reported to occur annually- mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. However, rabies can be prevented through vaccination of pets (dogs and cats) and administration of rabies vaccine in humans exposed to rabies. In our study we reviewed secondary data of animal bites and rabies captured at the National Animal disease diagnostic epidemiology centre in Entebbe for the period 2013-2017. We found that of 1441 animal bite victims who never received rabies vaccine, only 156 (11%) died hence need for immediate administration of exposed humans with rabies and sensitization of the public about the consequences of animal bites and need for urgent health care. There was a decline in the reporting rate of animal bites during the study period suggesting that evaluation of the barriers to complete reporting may facilitate interventions to enhance surveillance quality. Less than 10% of the pets in the Uganda were vaccinated against rabies hence need for improved vaccination of pets against rabies through appropriated legislation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a major public health concern in Ethiopia. However, knowledge about the complex zoonotic transmission cycle is limited, hampering implementation of control strategies. We explored the feeding behavior and activity of the vector (Phlebotomus pedifer) and established the role of livestock in CL transmission.\n\nMethodsBlood meal origins of engorged sand flies were determined by sequencing host DNA. A host choice experiment was performed to assess the feeding preference of P. pedifer when humans and hyraxes are equally accessible. Ear and nose biopsies from goats and bovines were screened for the presence of Leishmania parasites. Sand flies were captured indoor and outdoor with human landing catches (HLC) and CDC light traps to determine at which time and where P. pedifer is mostly active.\n\nPrincipal findingsA total of 180 sand flies were found to bite hosts of 12 genera. Humans were the predominant blood meal source (59.4%, p < 0.001) in all habitats, even in caves, where hyraxes are abundant. Only 10.6% of the sand flies fed on hyraxes based on the blood meal analysis, but the host choice experiment revealed that sand flies have a significant preference for feeding on hyraxes over humans (p = 0.009) when hosts are equally accessible. Only a single goat nose biopsy from 412 animal samples was found with Leishmania RNA. We found that P. pedifer is predominantly endophagic (p = 0.003), but occurs both indoors and outdoors. A substantial amount of sand flies was active in the early evening, which increased over time reaching its maximum around midnight.\n\nConclusionWe indicate that Leishmania transmission in southwestern Ethiopia is, in contrast to earlier suggestions, likely mainly anthroponotic and that livestock does not play a role in transmission. Combined indoor and outdoor vector control measures at night are required for efficient vector control.\n\nAuthor summaryCutaneous leishmaniasis is a major public health problem in Ethiopia. It is caused by Leishmania aethiopica protozoa that are transmitted when female sand flies take a blood meal. Hyraxes are assigned as the reservoirs of the infection, because many were found infected with Leishmania. There is very limited knowledge about the behavior of sand flies and other potential hosts of the infection. However, this information is a prerequisite for disease control, which is currently hampered. In this study, we found that humans are likely the main source of the infection and that the role of hyraxes in disease transmission needs further investigation to decide whether they should be included in control programs. Livestock appears not play a role in transmission, even though sand flies like to feed on them. We also show that sand flies are active indoors and outdoors, but have a preference for feeding inside human dwellings and that they are mostly active around midnight. Overall, we conclude that disease prevention and control should emphasize on human protection by applying vector control indoors, at night.",

Previous work demonstrated that indocyanine green (ICG) dye could label immune cells and be imaged after a delay during disease in the mouse retina. We report a pilot study investigating if ICG can similarly label immune cells within the human retina. Twelve adult participants receiving ICG angiography as part of routine standard of care were recruited. Baseline retinal images were obtained prior to ICG administration then repeated over a period ranging from 2 hours to 9 days. Matched peripheral blood samples, in addition to human and mouse macrophage cultures as controls, were analysed by flow cytometry. Differences between the delayed near infrared ICG imaging and 488 nm autofluorescence was observed across pathologies, likely arising from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Only one subject demonstrated ICG signal on peripheral blood myeloid cells and only three distinct cell-sized signals appeared over time within the retina of three participants. No significant increase in immune cell activation markers were detected after ICG administration. ICG accumulated in the endosomes of macrophage cultures and was detectable above a minimum concentration, suggesting cell labelling is possible. ICG can label RPE and may be used as an additional biomarker for cell health across a range of retinal disorders. Standard clinical doses of intravenous ICG do not lead to robust immune cell labelling in human blood or retina and further optimisation in dose and route are required.",

    "abstract": "Brain networks are complex dynamical systems in which directed interactions between different areas evolve at the sub-second scale of sensory, cognitive and motor processes. Due to the highly non-stationary nature of neural signals and their unknown noise components, however, modeling dynamic brain networks has remained one of the major challenges in contemporary neuroscience. Here, we present a new algorithm based on an innovative formulation of the Kalman filter that is optimized for tracking rapidly evolving patterns of directed functional connectivity under unknown noise conditions. The Self-Tuning Optimized Kalman filter (STOK) is a novel adaptive filter that embeds a self-tuning memory decay and a recursive regularization to guarantee high network tracking accuracy, temporal precision and robustness to noise. To validate the proposed algorithm, we performed an extensive comparison against the classical Kalman filter, in both realistic surrogate networks and real electroencephalography (EEG) data. In both simulations and real data, we show that the STOK filter estimates time-frequency patterns of directed connectivity with significantly superior performance. The advantages of the STOK filter were even clearer in real EEG data, where the algorithm recovered latent structures of dynamic connectivity from epicranial EEG recordings in rats and human visual evoked potentials, in excellent agreement with known physiology. These results establish the STOK filter as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic network structures in biological systems, with the potential to yield new insights into the rapid evolution of network states from which brain functions emerge.\n\nAuthor summaryDuring normal behavior, brains transition between functional network states several times per second. This allows humans to quickly read a sentence, and a frog to catch a fly. Understanding these fast network dynamics is fundamental to understanding how brains work, but up to now it has proven very difficult to model fast brain dynamics for various methodological reasons. To overcome these difficulties, we designed a new Kalman filter (STOK) by innovating on previous solutions from control theory and state-space modelling. We show that STOK accurately models fast network changes in simulations and real neural data, making it an essential new tool for modelling fast brain networks in the time and frequency domain.",

We hypothesized that osteoporotic conditions may be associated with PTBE occurrence after radiation in patients with intracranial meningioma.\n\nMethodsWe measured Hounsfield units (HU) of the frontal skull on simulation brain CT in patients who underwent linear accelerator (LINAC)-based radiation treatment for intracranial meningioma. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off values for several predictive factors. The cumulative hazard for PTBE was estimated and classified according to these factors. Hazard ratios were then estimated to identify independent predictive factors associated with the development of PTBE after radiation in intracranial meningioma patients.\n\nResultsA total of 83 intracranial meningiomas in 76 patients who received LINAC-based radiation treatment in our hospital over an approximate 5-year period were included for the study. We found mean frontal skull HU [&le;]630.625 and gross tumor volume >7.194 cc to be independent predictors of PTBE after radiation treatment in patients with meningioma (hazard ratio, 8.38; P=0.021; hazard ratio, 5.78; P=0.034, respectively). In addition, patients who were [&ge;]65 years showed a marginally significant association with PTBE.\n\nConclusionsOur study suggests that possible osteoporotic conditions, large tumor volume, and older age may be associated with PTBE occurrence after LINAC-based radiation treatment for intracranial meningioma.

    "abstract": "The nature of drilling predation, although well documented for molluscan fossils, is understudied for micromolluscs (&lt;5mm). Studying predation in micromolluscs is especially critical in evaluating the adaptive significance of micromorphy against predation and assessing the importance of predator-prey size relationship (PPSR). This study documents drilling predation event in microbivalves from early Miocene (Burdigalian) fossil assemblage of Quilon limestone from Kerala, India. Our sample of ~2000 valves represent nine families with an average drilling frequency (DF) of 0.06 and an incomplete drilling frequency (IDF) of 0.26. The characteristic drillhole morphology and occurrence of five genera of modern drilling gastropods (Naticid: Natica, Tanea and Polinices; Muricid: Triplex and Dermomurex) from the same locality reveals the predator identity. Predation in the studied assemblage is found to be highly selective in terms of prey taxa, size, mobility and site selection. Six out of nine families show evidence of predation indicating taxon selectivity. Poor correlation between DF and abundance further supports this view. Failed attacks are strongly correlated with morphological features such as surface ornamentation (Lucinidae), presence of conchiolin layers (Corbulidae). Drilling occurs primarily on medium size class and prey outside this size range show lower rate of attack. This indicates the existence of an \u201cinverse size refugia\u201d for extremely small prey along with the classical size refugia existing for large prey. Mobility is found to be a deterrent to drilling predation and it also increases failure.\n\u00a0Microbenthos of Quilon limestone shows a lower predation intensity in comparison to the Miocene macrobenthos worldwide including coeval formation of the Kutch Basin. The interaction in microbenthos is more strongly size-dependent in contrast to the Kutch fauna. Reduced predation intensity in microfauna and existence of \u201cinverse size refugia\u201d support the claim of micromorphy acting as a defense mechanism and highlights the role of size-dependent predation in marine benthos.",

This study aimed to explore the physiologic factors determining tolerance to effort during a HIIT. Forty-seven female participants (15-28 years old) were included: 23 athletes from Taiwan national or national reserve teams, and 24 moderately-active female. Each participant underwent maximal incremental (INC; modified-Bruce protocol) cardiopulmonary exercise testing and HIIT on treadmill, on separate days. HIIT protocol alternated a 1-min effort at 120% of the maximal speed and the same slope reached at the end of INC, with a 1-min rest, until volitional exhaustion. Gas-exchanges, and muscle oxygenation at right vastus lateralis by near-infrared spectroscopy, were continuously recorded. Additionally, bioelectrical impedance was utilized for body composition analysis. The result showed that Blim differed greatly (range: 2.6 to 12) among participants. Stepwise regression revealed that Blim was determined primarily by oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) at second-minute recovery; and, muscle tissue saturation index at peak of INC (R=0.644). Also, age and percent body fat were linearly correlated with Blim (adjusted R=-0.475, -0.371, p<0.05). Therefore, HIIT performance is determined by fast recovery of VO2 and HR, rather than maximal VO2 or muscle oxygenation recovery. Moreover, capacity to sustain a HIIT declines with age since as early as late adolescent. Further investigations on which factors should be manipulated to further improve athletes performance are warrant.",
