    "abstract": "We outline what we believe could be an improvement in future discussions of the brain acting as a Bayesian-Laplacian system. We do so by distinguishing between two broad classes of priors on which the brains inferential systems operate: in one category are biological priors ({beta} priors) and in the other artifactual ones ( priors). We argue that {beta} priors, of which colour categories and faces are good examples, are inherited or acquired very rapidly after birth, are highly or relatively resistant to change through experience, and are common to all humans. The consequence is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal assent and agreement is high. By contrast,  priors, of which man-made objects are examples, are acquired post-natally and modified at various stages throughout post-natal life; they are much more accommodating of, and hospitable to, new experiences. Consequently, posteriors generated from them are less likely to find universal assent. Taken together, in addition to the more limited capacity of experiment and experience to alter the {beta} priors compared to  priors, another cardinal distinction between the two is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal agreement is greater than that for  priors. The two categories are not, however, always totally distinct and can merge into one another to varying extents, resulting in posteriors that draw upon both categories.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic enzyme function and evolution is influenced by the larger context of a biochemical pathway - deleterious mutations or perturbations in one enzyme can often be compensated by mutations to others. To explore strategies for mapping adaptive dependencies between enzymes, we used a combination of comparative genomics and experiments to examine interactions with the model metabolic enzyme Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR). Biochemically, DHFR shares a metabolic intermediate with numerous folate metabolic enzymes. In contrast, comparative genomics analyses of synteny and gene co-occurrence indicate a sparse pattern of evolutionary couplings in which DHFR is coupled to the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TYMS), but is relatively independent from the rest of folate metabolism. To test this apparent modularity, we used quantitative growth rate measurements and forward evolution in E. coli to demonstrate that the two enzymes are coupled to one another, and can adapt independently from the remainder of the genome. Mechanistically, the coupling between DHFR and TYMS is driven by a constraint wherein TYMS activity must not greatly exceed that of DHFR - both to avoid depletion of reduced folates and prevent accumulation of the metabolic intermediate dihydrofolate. Extending our comparative genomics analyses genome-wide reveals over 200 gene pairs with statistical signatures similar to DHFR/TYMS, suggesting the possibility that cellular pathways might be decomposed into small adaptive units.",

    "abstract": "Originality-significance statementIncreased incidence of food-borne disease outbreaks caused by fresh produce contaminated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. has prompted researchers to examine the interaction between these bacteria and various plant species under different environmental conditions. Although studies show that human enteropathogenic bacteria survive both on the surface of and inside plants, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying plant invasion and colonization. Here, we examined the interaction between the human pathogenic bacterium Shigella and the model plant Arabidopsis. We found that four Shigella spp. strains proliferated successfully in Arabidopsis, causing symptom-like lesions in tissues. Using mutants lacking T3S effectors (i.e., noninvasive human strains), we demonstrated that effectors regulating pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in bacteria-plant interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine Shigella-mediated virulence and host immune suppression in a plant host at a molecular level.\\n\\nSummaryAlthough there is debate about whether human intestinal pathogenic bacteria are also plant pathogens, it is clear that these bacteria use plants as an alternative host. Shigella, which infects primates, is reportedly transmitted by fresh vegetables; however, its molecular interactions with plants have not been extensively studied. Here, we show that four Shigella strains, S. boydii (S. b), S. sonnei (S. s), S. flexneri 2a (S. f 2a), and S. flexneri 5a (S. f 5a), proliferated at different levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. Microscopic studies revealed that these bacteria were present inside leaves and damaged plant cells. GFP-labeled S. b, S. f 2a, and S. f 5a entered plants via guard cells, and S. f 2a infiltrated root tissues and colonized roots. Using mutants lacking type III secretion systems (T3SS), we found that T3SS of Shigella that regulate the pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in attachment and multiplication in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive activity of two T3S effectors, OspF and OspG, were needed for the proliferation of Shigella in Arabidopsis. These findings demonstrate that Shigella-mediated virulence determinants are expressed, and pathogenic symptoms are observed, in model plants.",

    "abstract": "Most transcriptional activity of exponentially growing cells is carried out by the RNA Polymerase I (Pol I), which produces a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor. In budding yeast, Pol I is a multimeric enzyme with 14 subunits. Among them, Rpa49 forms with Rpa34 a Pol I-specific heterodimer (homologous to PAF53/CAST heterodimer in human Pol I), which might be responsible for the specific functions of the Pol I. Previous studies provided insight in the involvement of Rpa49 in initiation, elongation, docking and releasing of Rrn3, an essential Pol I transcription factor. Here, we took advantage of the spontaneous occurrence of extragenic suppressors of the growth defect of the rpa49 null mutant to better understand the activity of Pol I. Combining genetic approaches, biochemical analysis of rRNA synthesis and investigation of the transcription rate at the individual gene scale, we characterized mutated residues of the Pol I as novel extragenic suppressors of the growth defect caused by the absence of Rpa49. When mapped on the Pol I structure, most of these mutations cluster within the jaw-lobe module, at an interface formed by the lobe in Rpa135 and the jaw made up of regions of Rpa190 and Rpa12. In vivo, the suppressor allele RPA135-F301S restores normal rRNA synthesis and increases Pol I density on rDNA genes when Rpa49 is absent. Growth of the Rpa135-F301S mutant is impaired when combined with exosome mutation rrp6{Delta} and it massively accumulates pre-rRNA. Moreover, Pol I bearing Rpa135-F301S is a hyper-active RNA polymerase in an in vitro tailed-template assay. We conclude that wild-type RNA polymerase I can be engineered to produce more rRNA in vivo and in vitro. We propose that the mutated area undergoes a conformational change that supports the DNA insertion into the cleft of the enzyme resulting in a super-active form of Pol I.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe nuclear genome of eukaryotic cells is transcribed by three RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is a multimeric enzyme specialized in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA. Deregulation of the Pol I function is linked to the etiology of a broad range of human diseases. Understanding the Pol I activity and regulation represents therefore a major challenge. We chose the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, because Pol I transcription apparatus is genetically amenable in this organism. Analyses of phenotypic consequences of deletion/truncation of Pol I subunits-coding genes in yeast indeed provided insights into the activity and regulation of the enzyme. Here, we characterized mutations in Pol I that can alleviate the growth defect caused by the absence of Rpa49, one of the subunits composing this multi-protein enzyme. We mapped these mutations on the Pol I structure and found that they all cluster in a well-described structural element, the jaw-lobe module. Combining genetic and biochemical approaches, we showed that Pol I bearing one of these mutations in the Rpa135 subunit is able to produce more ribosomal RNA in vivo and in vitro. We propose that this super-activity is explained by structural rearrangement of the Pol I jaw/lobe interface.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding (PC) theory posits that our brain employs a predictive model of the environment to infer the causes of its sensory inputs. A fundamental but untested prediction of this theory is that the same stimulus should elicit distinct precision weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) when different (feature-specific) predictions are violated, even in the absence of attention. Here, we tested this hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a multi-feature roving visual mismatch paradigm where rare changes in either color (red, green), or emotional expression (happy, fearful) of faces elicited pwPE responses in human participants. Using a computational model for learning and inference, we simulated pwPE trajectories of a Bayes-optimal observer and used these to analyze changes in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses to changes in color and emotional expression of faces while participants engaged in a distractor task. Controlling for visual attention by eye-tracking, we found pwPE responses to unexpected color changes in the fusiform gyrus. Conversely, unexpected changes of facial emotions elicited pwPE responses in thalamo-cortico-cerebellar structures associated with emotion processing. Our results support a general role of PC across perception, from low-level to complex and socially relevant object features, and suggest that monitoring of the social environment occurs continuously and automatically, even in the absence of attention.\\n\\nHighlightsPredictive coding (PC) implies that brain responses should reflect transient precision weighted prediction errors (pwPEs). By using fMRI we show that rare changes in color or emotional expression of human faces elicit pwPE responses in dedicated neuronal circuits with known specialization in processing color and emotion-related information, respectively. Our results demonstrate that physically identical stimuli elicit pwPEs in distinct neuronal circuits when different (feature-specific) predictions are violated, depending on current sensory expectations based on prior stimulus context. The demonstration of pwPEs in visual areas as well as in emotion processing structures lends experimental support to theoretical accounts of PC in color and social perception, respectively.",

    "abstract": "A number of enzymes reportedly exhibit enhanced diffusion in the presence of their substrates, with a Michaelis-Menten-like concentration dependence. Although no definite explanation of this phenomenon has emerged, a physical picture of enzyme self-propulsion using energy from the catalyzed reaction has been widely considered. Here, we present a kinematic and thermodynamic analysis of enzyme self-propulsion that is independent of any specific propulsion mechanism. Using this theory, along with biophysical data compiled for all enzymes so far shown to undergo enhanced diffusion, we show that the propulsion speed required to generate experimental levels of enhanced diffusion exceeds the speeds of well-known active biomolecules, such as myosin, by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the minimum power dissipation required to account for enzyme self-propulsion markedly exceeds the chemical power available from enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Alternative explanations for the observation of enhanced enzyme diffusion merit strong consideration.",

    "abstract": "Present chemotherapeutics are inadequate against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) an immunosuppressive ailment caused by Leishmania donovani. Despite the interest in plant-based drug development, an antileishmanial drug from plant source is unavailable. Glinus oppositifolius had been reported in favor of being immunomodulators along with other traditional uses. Novel anti-VL therapies can rely on host immune-modulation with associated leishmanicidal action. With this rationale, an n-BuOH fraction of the methanolic extract of the plant and isolated triterpenoid saponin Spergulin-A were evaluated against acellular and intracellular L. donovani. Immunostimulatory activity of them was confirmed by elevated TNF-a and extracellular NO production from treated M{Phi}s and was found nontoxic to the host cells. Identification and structure confirmation for isolated Spergulin-A was performed by ESI-MS,13C, and 1H NMR. Spergulin-A was found ineffective against the acellular forms while, against the intracellular parasites at 30g/ml, the reduction was 92.6% after 72h. Spergulin-A enhanced ROS and nitric oxide (NO) release and changes in Gp91-phox, i-NOS, and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines elaborated its intracellular anti-leishmanial activity. The results supported that G. oppositifolius and Spergulin-A can potentiate new lead molecules for the development of alternative drugs against VL.\\n\\nAuthor summaryVisceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is prevalent in tropical and temperate regions and is endemic in 88 countries with an estimated yearly incidence of 1-1.5 million cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 500,000 cases of VL, of which 70,000 people die every year. More than 90% of cases occur in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil with an estimated incidence of at least 500,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths each year.\\n\\nThis work highlights the anti-leishmanial effect of a triterpenoid saponin that was extracted from a tropical plant, Glinus oppositifolius, commonly found in Asian and parts of African countries. The drug showed potent Leishmanicidal activity against Leishmania donovani at very low concentration. As the application of the conventional drugs (pentavalent antimoniates, amphotericin B, and pentamidine) is limited due to low efficacy, life-threatening side effects, high toxicity, induction of parasite resistance, length of treatment and high cost and anti-leishmanial vaccines may not become available in the near future, so plant extracts or plant compounds, represent a valuable source of new medicinal agents and alternative, effective and less toxic treatments, leading to a search for natural products with a potential leishmanicidal action. Being an immunosuppressive disease efficacy against VL can be demonstrated against intracellular parasites in the lights of emphasizing host M{Phi} immunostimulation as elaborated precisely in the present study.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/458653_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (30K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f93fa1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c073f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fbb86aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1085c11_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure determination is one of the most extensively studied problems due to its increasing importance in biological function analysis. We adopt a novel method, based on one of the matrix completion (MC) techniques-the Riemannian approach, to solve the protein structure determination problem. We formulate the protein structure in terms of low-rank matrix which can be solved by an optimization problem in the Riemannian spectrahedron manifold whose objective function has been delimited with the derived boundary condition. Two efficient algorithms in Riemannian approach-the trust-region (Tr) algorithm and the conjugate gradient (Cg) algorithm are used to reconstruct protein structures. We first use the two algorithms in a toy model and show that the Tr algorithm is more robust. Afterwards, we rebuild the protein structure from the NOE distance information deposited in NMR Restraints Grid (http://restraintsgrid.bmrb.wisc.edu/NRG/MRGridServlet). A dataset with both X-ray crystallographic structure and NMR structure deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB) is used to statistically evaluate the performance of our method. By comparing both our rebuilt structures and NMR counterparts with the \\\"standard\\\" X-ray structures, we conclude that our rebuilt structures have similar (sometimes even smaller) RMSDs relative to \\\"standard\\\" X-ray structures in contrast with the reference NMR structures. Besides, we also validate our method by comparing the Z-scores between our rebuilt structures with reference structures using Protein Structure Validation Software suit. All the validation scores indicate that the Riemannian approach in MC techniques is valid in reconstructing the protein structures from NOE distance information. The software based on Riemannian approach is freely available at https://github.com/xubiaopeng/Protein_Recon_MCRiemman.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMatrix Completion is a technique widely used in many aspects, such as the global positioning in sensor networks, collaborative filtering in recommendation system for many companies and face recognition, etc. In biology, distance geometry used to be a popular method for reconstructing protein structures related to NMR experiment. However, due to the low quality of the reconstructed results, those methods were replaced by other dynamic methods such as ARIA, CYANA and UNIO. Recently, a new MC technique named Riemannian approach is introduced and proved mathematically, which promotes us to apply it in protein structure determination from NMR measurements. In this paper, by combining the Riemannian approach and some post-processing procedures together, we reconstruct the protein structures from the incomplete distance information measured by NMR. By evaluating our results and comparing with the corresponding PDB NMR deposits, we show that the current Riemannian approach method is valid and at least comparable with (if not better than) the state-of-art methods in NMR structure determination.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is an indispensable strategy for lung cancer, however, treatment failure or reoccurrence is often found in patients due to the developing radioresistance. Novel approaches are required for radiosensitizing to improve the therapeutic efficacy. In present study, we found that transglutaminase 2 (TG2) confers radioresistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through regulating TOPOII and promoting DNA repair. Our data showed that TG2 inhibitor or knockdown increased NSCLC radiosensitivity in vivo and in vitro. We found that TG2 translocated into nucleus and located to DSB sites, surprisingly, knockdown TG2 or glucosamine inhibited the phosphorylation of ATM, ATR and DNA-Pkcs. Through IP-MS assay and functional experiments, we identified that TOPOII as an downstream factor of TG2. Moreover, we found that TGase domain account for the interaction with TOPOII. Finally, we found that TG2 expression was correlated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma instead of squamous cell carcinoma. In conclusion, we demonstrated that inhibiting TG2 sensitize NSCLC to IR through interfere TOPOII mediated DNA repair, suggesting TG2 as a potential radiosensitizing target in NSCLC.",

This qualitative study evaluated perspectives about the emergency response to this outbreak.\\n\\nMethods/FindingsWe conducted 39 key informant interviews and focused group discussions, and reviewed 21 documents with participants involved with surveillance, water-sanitation-hygiene, case management, oral cholera vaccine, communications, logistics, and coordination. Qualitative data analysis used thematic techniques comprising key-words-in-context, word-repetition, and key-sector-terms.\\n\\nAuthorities were alerted quickly, but outbreak declaration took 12 days due to a 10 day delay waiting for culture confirmation. Outbreak investigation revealed several potential transmission channels, but a leaking latrine around the index cases house was not repaired for >7 days.\\n\\nUse of chlorine disinfectant was initially not accepted by the community due to rumors that it would sterilize women. This could have been avoided with improved community consultation. Initially, key messages were communicated in Hausa, although  Kanuri was the primary language; later this was corrected.

By October, it appeared in six local government areas with a total of 5,340 cases reported including 61 deaths. We evaluated the perspectives of the emergency response by the government of Nigeria and implementing partners to stop the outbreak. We conducted 39 interviews and group discussions and also studied 21 documents related to the outbreak response. We found that epidemiologic surveillance timely alerted the health authorities about the outbreak, but the outbreak was declared 12 days later, awaiting for culture confirmation. This led to delays in the initial response. We also observed that conditions in the IDPs camps like overflowing latrines, overcrowding, and open defecation were highly favorable to cholera transmission. Improved IDP camp conditions are needed to prevent cholera and other water born infections and strengthened laboratory capacity is needed to enable a more rapid response.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic inflammation is the driver of liver injury resulting in progressive fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis. The consequences include both liver failure and liver cancer. We have previously described increased expression of the highly multifunctional glycoprotein CD147 in liver injury. This work describes a novel role of CD147 in liver inflammation and the importance of leukocyte aggregates in determining the extent of liver injury.\\n\\nMethodsNon-diseased, progressive injury and cirrhotic liver from humans and mice were examined using mAb targeting CD147. Inflammatory cell subsets were assessed by multicolor flow cytometry.\\n\\nResultsIn liver injury, we observe abundant intrahepatic leukocyte clusters defined as [&ge;]5 adjacent CD45+ cells which we have labelled \\\"leukocyte aggregates\\\". We have shown that these leukocyte aggregates are significant in determining the extent of liver injury. If CD147 is blocked in vivo, these leukocyte aggregates diminish in size and number together with a marked significant reduction in liver injury including fibrosis. This accompanied by no change in overall intrahepatic leukocyte numbers. Further, blocking aggregation formation occurs prior to an appreciable increase in inflammatory markers or fibrosis. Additionally, there were no observed, \\\"off-target\\\" or unpredicted effects in targeting CD147.\\n\\nConclusionCD147 mediates leukocyte aggregation which is associated with the development of liver injury. This is not a secondary effect, but a cause of injury as aggregate formation proceeds other markers of injury. Leukocyte aggregation has been previously described in inflammation dating back over many decades but till now been shown to determine the extent of injury.",

    "abstract": "When exposed to lethal doses of antibiotics, bacterial populations are most often not completely eradicated. A small number of phenotypic variants, defined as  persisters, are refractory to antibiotics and survive treatment. Despite their involvement in relapsing infections caused by major pathogens, processes determining phenotypic switches from and to the persister state largely remain elusive. This is mainly due to the low frequency of persisters in a population and the lack of reliable persistence markers, both hampering studies of persistence at the single-cell level. Problematically, existing methods to enrich for persisters result in samples with very low persister densities and/or a too high abundance of other cell types. Here we present a novel and highly effective persister isolation method involving cephalexin, an antibiotic that induces extensive filamentation of susceptible cells. We show that antibiotic-tolerant cells can easily be separated by size after a short cephalexin treatment, and that the isolated cells are genuine persisters. We used our isolation method to monitor persister outgrowth at the single-cell level in a microfluidic device, thereby conclusively demonstrating that awakening is a stochastic phenomenon. We anticipate that our novel approach can have far-reaching consequences in the persistence field, by allowing single-cell studies at a much higher throughput than previously reported.",

In tracking experiments conducted in an orchard (established in 1996), the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarker method was employed to know soil microbial system. Total PLFAs concentration did not vary significantly between soil depths but changed between seasons. It peaked in the summer at 258.97 {+/-} 23.48 g g-1 soil from 0-5 cm and at 270.99 {+/-} 58.94 g g-1 soil from 5-20 cm. A total of 33 microbial fatty acid biomarkers were observed and identified in the sampled soil. Quantities of PLFAs for 29 microbe groups varied significantly between seasons, except for 15:0 iso 3OH, 15:1 iso G, 16:0 2OH, and 17:0 iso 3OH. The bacterial PLFAs and fungal and actinomycotic PLFAs in the orchard soil collected in Summer were significantly higher than in the Spring or Autumn (P < 0.01). The number of soil microorganism species (Richness) and the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indexes were all the highest in summer. The total PLFAs, bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs, actinomycotic PLFAs, Richness, or the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indexes were all significantly negatively correlated with soil pH, total carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and cation-exchange capacity (CEC) (P < 0.05).",

To date, knowledge on neuronal development is largely based on murine data and largely restricted to the genomic and transcriptomic level. Advances in stem cell differentiation now enable the study of human neuronal development, and here we provide a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic signature, at high temporal resolution, of human stem cell-derived neurons. To reveal proteomic changes during neuronal development we make use of two differentiation approaches, either by expression of neurogenin-2 (Ngn2) leading to glutamatergic induced neurons (iN) or via small molecule manipulations, leading to patterned motor neurons. Our analysis revealed key proteins that show significant expression changes (FDR <0.001) during neuronal differentiation. We overlay our proteomics data with available transcriptomic data during neuronal differentiation and show distinct, datatype-specific, signatures. Overall, we provide a rich resource of information on proteins associated with human neuronal development, and moreover, highlight several signaling pathways involved, such as Wnt and Notch.",

Females lacking RpS5b produce ovaries with numerous developmental defects that undergo widespread apoptosis in mid-oogenesis. Females lacking germline RpS5a are fully fertile, but germline expression of interfering RNA targeting germline RpS5a in an RpS5b mutant background worsened the RpS5b phenotype and blocked oogenesis before egg chambers form. A broad spectrum of mRNAs co-purified in immunoprecipitations with RpS5a, while RpS5b-associated mRNAs were specifically enriched for GO terms related to mitochondrial electron transport and cellular metabolic processes. Consistent with this, RpS5b mitochondrial fractions are depleted for proteins linked to oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration, and RpS5b mitochondria tended to form large clusters and had more heterogeneous morphology than those from controls. We conclude that RpS5b-containing ribosomes preferentially associate with particular mRNAs and serve an essential function in oogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous {beta}-herpesvirus that infects many different cell types. CMV has been found in several solid tumors and it has been hypothesized that it may promote cellular transformation or exacerbate tumor growth. Paradoxically, in some experimental situations, CMV infection delays tumor growth. We previously showed that wild-type murine (M)CMV delayed the growth of poorly immunogenic B16 melanomas via an undefined mechanism. Here we show that MCMV delayed the growth of these immunologically \\\"cold\\\" tumors by recruiting and modulating tumor-associated macrophages. Depletion of monocytic phagocytes with clodronate completely prevented MCMV from delaying tumor growth. Mechanistically, our data suggest that MCMV recruits new macrophages to the tumor via the virus-encoded chemokine MCK2, and viruses lacking this chemokine were unable to delay tumor growth. Moreover, MCMV infection of macrophages drove them toward an M1-like state. Importantly, adaptive immune responses were also necessary for MCMV to delay tumor growth as the effect was substantially blunted in Rag-deficient animals. However, viral spread was not needed and a spread-defective MCMV strain was equally effective. In most mice, the anti-tumor effect of MCMV was transient. Although the recruited macrophages persisted, tumor regrowth correlated with a loss of viral activity in the tumor. However, an additional round of MCMV infection further delayed tumor growth, suggesting that tumor growth delay was dependent on active viral infection. Together, our results suggest that MCMV infection delayed the growth of an immunologically \\\"cold\\\" tumor by recruiting and modulating macrophages in order to promote anti-tumor immune responses.\\n\\nImportanceCytomegalovirus (CMV) is an exciting new platform for vaccines and cancer therapy. Although CMV may delay tumor growth in some settings, there is also evidence that CMV may promote cancer development and progression. Thus, defining the impact of CMV on tumors is critical. Using a mouse model of melanoma, we previously found that murine (M)CMV delayed tumor growth and activated tumor-specific immunity, although the mechanism was unclear. We now show that MCMV delayed tumor growth not by infecting and killing tumor cells, but rather by recruiting macrophages to the tumor. A viral chemokine was necessary to recruit macrophages and delay tumor growth. Furthermore, MCMV infection altered the functional state of the macrophages. Finally, we found that repeated MCMV injections sustained the anti-tumor effect suggesting that active viral infection was needed. Thus, MCMV altered tumor growth by actively recruiting and infecting macrophages in the tumor.",

    "abstract": "Diphtheria is caused by toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium ulcerans and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. For diagnostic purposes, species identification and detection of toxigenic strains (diphtheria toxin (tox)-positive strains) is typically performed using end-point PCR. A faster quadruplex real-time PCR (qPCR) was recently developed (De Zoysa et al. J Med Microbiol. 2016 65(12):1521-1527). Here, we present an improvement of the quadruplex method, in which a 16S rRNA gene target was added as an internal processing control, providing confirmation of the presence of bacterial DNA in the assays. This improved qPCR method was validated using 36 bacterial isolates and 16 clinical samples. The method allows detection of the tox gene and distinguishing C. diphtheriae (including the newly described species C. belfantii) from C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis. Complete diagnostic specificity, sensitivity and experimental robustness of the method to temperature and reagent concentration variations were demonstrated. The lower limit of detection for C. diphtheriae, C. ulcerans and tox targets was 1.86 genome copies per 5 L reaction volume. Finally, the method was successfully used on two distinct qPCR technologies (LightCycler 480, Roche Diagnostics and Rotor-Gene Q, Qiagen) and in two laboratories (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France and Public Health England - National Infection Service, London, UK). This work describes validation of the improved qPCR quadruplex method and supports its implementation for the biological diagnosis of diphtheria.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) form mesoscale condensates by liquid-liquid phase separation that play essential roles in subcellular dynamic compartmentalization. The formation and dissolution of many RNP condensates are finely dependent on the RNA-to-RNP ratio, giving rise to a window-like phase separation behavior. This is commonly referred to as reentrant liquid condensation (RLC). Here, using RNP-inspired polypeptides with low-complexity RNA-binding sequences as well as the C-terminal disordered domain of the ribonucleoprotein FUS as model systems, we investigate the molecular driving forces underlying this non-monotonous phase transition. We show that an interplay between short-range cation-{pi} attractions and long-range electrostatic forces governs the heterotypic RLC of RNP-RNA complexes. Short-range attractions, which can be encoded by both polypeptide chain primary sequence and nucleic acid base sequence, are activated by RNP-RNA condensate formation. After activation, the short-range forces regulate material properties of polypeptide-RNA condensates and subsequently oppose their reentrant dissolution. In the presence of excess RNA, a competition between short-range attraction and long-range electrostatic repulsion drives the formation of a colloid-like cluster phase. With increasing short-range attraction, the fluid dynamics of the cluster phase is arrested, leading to the formation of a colloidal gel. Our results reveal that phase behavior, supramolecular organization, and material states of RNP-RNA assemblies are controlled by a dynamic interplay between molecular interactions at different length scales.",

    "abstract": "During metastasis cancer cells are exposed to potentially destructive hemodynamic forces including fluid shear stress (FSS) while en route to distant sites. However, prior work indicates that cancer cells are more resistant to brief pulses of high-level fluid shear stress (FSS) in vitro relative to non-transformed epithelial cells. Herein we identify a mechanism of FSS resistance in cancer cells, and extend these findings to mouse models of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We show that cancer cells acutely isolated from primary tumors are resistant to FSS. Our findings demonstrate that cancer cells activate the RhoA-myosin II axis in response to FSS, which protects them from FSS-induced plasma membrane damage. Moreover, we show that the myosin II activity is protective to CTCs in mouse models. Collectively our data indicate that viable CTCs actively resist destruction by hemodynamic forces and are likely to be more mechanically robust than is commonly thought.",

    "abstract": "The abnormal proliferation of cancer cells is driven by deregulated oncogenes or tumor suppressors, of which the cancer vulnerable genes are attractive therapeutic targets. Targeting mislocalization of oncogenes and tumor suppressors resulting from aberrant nuclear export is effective for inhibiting growth transformation of cancer cells. We performed a CRISPR-Cas9 screening in a unique model of matched primary and oncogenic KSHV-transformed cells, and identified genes that were pro-growth and growth-suppressive of both cells, of which exportin XPO1 was demonstrated to be critical for the survival of transformed cells. Using XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 and by siRNA knockdown, we confirmed the essential role of XPO1 in cell proliferation and growth transformation of KSHV-transformed cells, and cell lines of other cancers including gastric cancer and liver cancer. XPO1 inhibition induced cell cycle arrest through p53 activation but the mechanism of p53 activation differed among different types of cancer cells. p53 activation depended on the formation of PML nuclear bodies in gastric cancer and liver cancer cells. Mechanistically, XPO1 inhibition induced relocalization of autophagy adaptor protein p62 (SQSTM1), recruiting p53 for activation in PML nuclear bodies. Taken together, we have identified novel pro-growth and growth-suppressive genes of primary and cancer cells, and demonstrated XPO1 as a vulnerable target of cancer cells. XPO1 inhibition induces cell arrest through a novel PML-and p62-dependent mechanism of p53 activation in some types of cancer cells.\\n\\nImportanceUsing a model of oncogenic virus KSHV driven cellular transformation of primary cells, we have performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify vulnerable genes of cancer cells. This screening is unique in that this virus-induced oncogenesis model does not depend on any cellular genetic alterations, and has matched primary and KSHV-transformed cells, which are not available for similar screenings in other types of cancer. We have identified genes that are both pro-growth and growth-suppressive in primary and transformed cells, some of which could represent novel proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. In particular, we have demonstrated exportin XPO1 as a critical factor for the survival of transformed cells. Using a XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 and by siRNA-mediated knockdown, we have confirmed the essential role of XPO1 in cell proliferation and growth transformation of KSHV-transformed cells, as well as gastric and liver cancer cells. XPO1 inhibition induces cell cycle arrest by activating p53 but the mechanism of p53 activation differed among different types of cancer cells. p53 activation is dependent on the formation of PML nuclear bodies in gastric and liver cancer cells. Mechanistically, XPO1 inhibition induces relocalization of autophagy adaptor protein p62 (SQSTM1), recruiting p53 for activation in PML nuclear bodies. These results illustrate XPO1 as a vulnerable target of cancer cells, and reveal a novel mechanism for blocking cancer cell proliferation by XPO1 inhibition as well as a novel PML-and p62-mediated mechanism of p53 activation in some types of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Tissue acidosis can be a consequence of numerous disease states including stroke, myocardial infarction, limb ischemia, and inflammation. Blood vessels existing in the affected tissues are associated with the progression of acidosis-related diseases. However, the mechanisms by which endothelial cells (ECs) lining the affected blood vessels sense and respond to an acidic microenvironment remain largely unclear. We investigated the functional effects of the proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor GPR4 in acidosis-induced endothelial inflammation. GPR4 is highly expressed in ECs and known to regulate EC inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses within acidic microenvironments. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that GPR4 activation by acidosis increases EC paracellular gap formation and permeability. We further demonstrate that GPR4-mediated paracellular gap formation is dependent on the G12/13 signaling pathway. To assess the functional role of GPR4 in the inflammatory response in vivo, we utilized an acute hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model. We demonstrate that both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of GPR4 reduce tissue edema, exudate formation, endothelial adhesion molecule expression, and leukocyte infiltration in the inflamed tissue. Collectively, these data suggest GPR4/G12/13 signaling mediates acidosis-induced endothelial paracellular gap formation and permeability. This study implicates GPR4 as a candidate therapeutic target for the remediation of inflammation and tissue edema.",

    "abstract": "A decade of genetic studies has established Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) as a prominent susceptibility gene associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. The development and characterization of Cntnap2 knockout models in multiple species have bolstered this claim by establishing clear connections with certain endophenotypes. Despite these remarkable in vivo findings, CNTNAP2s molecular functions are relatively unexplored, highlighting the need to identify novel protein partners. Here, we characterized an interaction between CNTNAP2 and Partitioning-defective 3 (Par3) - a polarity molecule we isolated in a yeast-two hybrid screen with CNTNAP2s C-terminus. We provide evidence that the two proteins interact via PDZ domain-mediated binding, that CNTNAP2+/Par3+ complexes are largely associated with clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles, and that Par3 causes an enlargement of these structures. Live imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) reveals that Par3 limits the mobility of CNTNAP2 at endosomes, thus stabilizing it at that location. Finally, expression of Par3 but not Par3{Delta}PDZ can cluster endogenous CNTNAP2 in primary neurons. Collectively, we conclude that Par3 regulates CNTNAP2 spatial localization to endocytic compartments.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphTDP-43 is an essential DNA/RNA processing protein that undergoes both functional and pathogenic aggregation. Functional TDP-43 aggregates are reversible, forming transient species such as nuclear bodies, stress granules, and myo-granules1-3. In contrast pathogenic TDP-43 aggregates are irreversible, forming stable intracellular amyloid-like inclusions4,5. These inclusions are the primary pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP)6. Disease-associated, hereditary mutations in TDP-43 are known to accelerate the deposition of irreversible aggregates in the cytoplasm7. Reversible TDP-43 aggregation has been shown to precede the formation of irreversible amyloid fibrils similar to the behavior of proteins hnRNPA1 and FUS8-10. Still unknown, however, are the structural features of TDP-43 fibrils that confer both reversibility and irreversibility and how hereditary mutations can impose irreversible aggregation. Here, we determined the structures of amyloid fibrils formed by two segments previously reported to be the pathogenic cores of TDP-43 aggregation7,11,12; these are termed SegA (residues 311-360) and SegB A315E (residues 286-331 containing the ALS hereditary mutation A315E). SegA forms three polymorphs, all with dagger-shaped folds. SegB forms R-shaped folds. All four polymorphs have folds confined to two dimensions, and are stabilized by hydrophobic cores and peripheral hydrogen bonds. Energetic analysis suggests that the dagger-shaped polymorphs are examples of the irreversible fibril structures of TDP-43, whereas the SegB polymorph may participate in both reversible and irreversible fibril structure. Our structure suggests how the A315E mutation may convert this polymorph to the irreversible type and lead to mutation-enhanced pathology.",

    "abstract": "Although receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) have been shown to modulate the functions of several different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), potential direct interactions among the three known RAMPs and hundreds of GPCRs has never been investigated. We engineered three epitope-tagged RAMPs and 23 epitope-tagged GPCRs, focusing on the secretin-like family of GPCRs, and developed a suspension bead array (SBA) immunoassay designed to detect RAMP-GPCR complexes. We then used 64 antibodies raised against native RAMPs and GPCRs, along with four antibodies targeting the epitope tags, to multiplex the SBA assay to detect and measure all possible combinations of interaction among the 23 GPCRs and three RAMPs. The results of the SBA assay provide a complete interactome of secretin-like GPCRs with RAMPs. We demonstrate direct interaction of previously reported secretin-like GPCRs whose functions are modulated by RAMPs. We also discovered novel sets of GPCR-RAMP interacting pairs, and found additional secretin-like GPCRs, chemokine receptors and orphan receptors that interact with RAMPs. Using in situ roximity ligation assay, we verified a subset of these novel GPCR-RAMP interactions in cell membranes. In total, we found GPCR-RAMP interactions for the majority of the 23 GPCRs tested. Each GPCR interacted with either all three RAMPs or with RAMP2 and RAMP3, with the exception of one GPCR that interacted with just RAMP3. In summary, we describe an SBA strategy that will be useful to search for GPCR-RAMP interactions in cell lines and tissues, and conclude that GPCR-RAMP interactions are more common than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) have been implicated in the onset of memory deficits in Alzheimers disease, perhaps due to their reported ability to impair long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. We previously showed the effect of Abeta on LTP depends on the strength of LTP induction. Furthermore, Abeta affects EPSP-Spike (E-S) potentiation more robustly than LTP, suggesting that E-S potentiation may be equally important to learning and memory in the context of Alzheimers disease. Here we extend our findings to two additional forms of Abeta that form higher concentrations of soluble Abeta oligomers and show that they also affect E-S potentiation at induction strengths where there is no effect on LTP in hippocampal slices.",

Memory formed with sensory specificity determines its utility for selectively cueing subsequent behavior, even in novel situations. If an individual forms generalized memory, then there is potential for novel sensory cues to interfere with accurate behavioral performance. Here, a rodent model of auditory learning capitalized on individual differences in learning-induced auditory neuroplasticity to identify and characterize neural substrates for sound-specific (vs. general) memory of the training signals acoustic frequency. Animals with naturally or pharmacologically induced signal-\\\"specific\\\" memory revealed behaviorally, exhibited long-lasting signal-specific neurophysiological plasticity in auditory cortical and subcortical evoked responses, while learning-induced changes were not detected in animals with \\\"general\\\" memories. Individual differences validated this brain-behavior relationship, such that the degree of change in neurophysiological responses could be used to determine the precision of memory formation.",
