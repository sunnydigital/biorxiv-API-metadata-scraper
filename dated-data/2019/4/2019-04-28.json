    "abstract": "As a person reads, the brain performs complex operations to create higher order semantic representations from individual words. While these steps are effortless for competent readers, we are only beginning to understand how the brain performs these actions. Here, we explore semantic composition using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of people reading adjective-noun phrases presented one word at a time. We track the neural representation of semantic information over time, through different brain regions. Our results reveal two novel findings: 1) a neural representation of the adjective is present during noun presentation, but this neural representation is different from that observed during adjective presentation 2) the neural representation of adjective semantics observed during adjective reading is reactivated after phrase reading, with remarkable consistency. We also note that while the semantic representation of the adjective during the reading of the adjective is very distributed, the later representations are concentrated largely to temporal and frontal areas previously associated with composition. Taken together, these results paint a picture of information flow in the brain as phrases are read and understood.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTCultural background influences social cognition, however no study has examined brain stimulation differences attributable to cultural background. 104 young adults [52 South-East Asian Singaporeans (SEA); 52 Caucasian Australians (CA)] received anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) or the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). Participants completed tasks with varying demands on self-other processing including visual perspective taking and episodic memory with self and other encoding. At baseline, SEA showed greater self-other integration than CA in the level one (line-of-sight) VPT task as indexed by greater interference from the alternate perspective. Anodal HD-tDCS to the dmPFC resulted in the CA performing closer to the SEA during egocentric perspective judgements. Baseline performance on level two (embodied rotation) VPT task and the self-reference effect in memory (SRE) was comparable between the two groups. In the combined sample, HD-tDCS to the rTPJ decreased the interference from the egocentric perspective during level two VPT and dmPFC HD-tDCS removed the SRE in episodic memory. Stimulation effects were comparable when baseline performance was comparable. When baseline performance differed, stimulation differences were identified. Therefore, social cognitive differences due to cultural background are an important consideration in social brain stimulation studies.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICompared with Caucasians, South-East Asians were influenced by the alternate perspective to a greater extent during level one visual perspective taking\\nC_LIO_LIAnodal HD-tDCS to the dmPFC shifted Caucasians closer to the baseline performance of South-East Asians\\nC_LIO_LIAnodal HD-tDCS to the dmPFC removed the self-reference effect in episodic memory in both cultural groups\\nC_LIO_LIAnodal HD-tDCS to the dmPFC reduced overall memory performance in the South-East Asians but not in the Caucasian group\\nC_LIO_LIAnodal HD-tDCS to the rTPJ reduced egocentric interference in a level two visual perspective taking task in both cultural groups\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The existence of discrete phenotypic traits suggests that the complex regulatory processes which produce them are functionally modular. These processes are usually represented by networks. Only modular networks can be partitioned into intelligible subcircuits able to evolve relatively independently. Traditionally, functional modularity is approximated by detection of modularity in network structure. However, the correlation between structure and function is loose. Many regulatory networks exhibit modular behaviour without structural modularity. Here we partition an experimentally tractable regulatory network--the gap gene system of dipteran insects--using an alternative approach. We show that this system, although not structurally modular, is composed of dynamical modules driving different aspects of whole-network behaviour. All these subcircuits share the same regulatory structure, but differ in components and sensitivity to regulatory interactions. Some subcircuits are in a state of criticality while others are not, which explains the observed differential evolvability of the various expression features in the system.",

    "abstract": "Intraneuronal accumulation of -synuclein (Syn) is key in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD). Published studies suggest that this process begins in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and propagates into the brain decades before clinical diagnosis of PD. The triggers and mechanisms underlying the accumulation of Syn remain unknown but evidence is growing, that immune pathways and in particular colitis may play a critical role. Here we demonstrate that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit Syn accumulation in their colon. We then confirmed in an experimental model of IBD that intestinal inflammation can trigger Syn accumulation in the ENS of wildtype and Syn transgenic mice. We discovered that the type and degree of inflammation modulates the extent of Syn accumulation in the colon and that macrophage-related signaling limits this process. Remarkably, experimental colitis at three months of age exacerbated the accumulation of aggregated phospho-Serine 129 Syn in the midbrain, including the substantia nigra, in 21-month but not 9-month-old Syn transgenic mice. This was accompanied by loss of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons, another neuropathological hallmark of PD. Together, our data suggest a critical role for intestinal inflammation in the initiation and progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentification of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) can reveal mechanistic insights of infectious diseases for potential treatments and drug discoveries. Current computational methods for the prediction of HPIs often rely on our knowledge on the sequences and functions of pathogen proteins, which is limited for many species, especially for emerging pathogens. Matching the phenotypes elicited by pathogens with phenotypes associated with host proteins might improve the prediction of HPIs.\n\nResultsWe developed an ontology-based machine learning method that predicts potential interaction protein partners for pathogens. Our method exploits information about disease mechanisms through features learned from phenotypic, functional and taxonomic knowledge about pathogens and human proteins. Additionally, by embedding the phenotypic information of the pathogens within a formal representation of pathogen taxonomy, we demonstrate that our model can accurately predict interaction partners for pathogens without known phenotypes, using a combination of their taxonomic relationships with other pathogens and information from ontologies as background knowledge. Our results show that the integration of phenotypic, functional and taxonomic knowledge not only improves the prediction of HPIs, but also enables us to investigate novel pathogens in emerging infectious diseases.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/hpi-predict\n\nContactrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa",

Although researchers argue that object shape is crucial in these cases, there are open questions as to how shape is represented for object recognition. Here we tested whether the human visual system incorporates a three-dimensional skeletal descriptor of shape to determine an objects identity. Skeletal models not only provide a compact description of an objects global shape structure, but also provide a quantitative metric by which to compare the visual similarity between shapes. Our results showed that a model of skeletal similarity explained the greatest amount of variance in participants object dissimilarity judgments when compared with other computational models of visual similarity (Experiment 1). Moreover, parametric changes to an objects skeleton led to proportional changes in perceived similarity, even when controlling for another model of structure (Experiment 2). Importantly, participants preferentially categorized objects by their skeletons across changes to local shape contours and non-accidental properties (Experiment 3). Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal structure in vision, not only as a shape descriptor, but also as a diagnostic cue of object identity.",

    "abstract": "Cellulose over-producing wrinkly spreader mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 have been the focus of much investigation, but conditions promoting the production of cellulose in ancestral SBW25, its effects and consequences have escaped investigation through lack of in vitro phenotype. Here, using a custom built device, we reveal that in static broth microcosms ancestral SBW25 encounters environmental signals at the air-liquid interface that activate, via three diguanylate cyclase-encoding pathways (Wsp, Aws and Mws), production of cellulose. Secretion of the polymer at the meniscus leads to modification of the environment and growth of numerous micro-colonies that extend out from the surface. Accumulation of cellulose and associated microbial growth leads to Rayleigh-Taylor instability resulting in bioconvection and rapid transport of water-soluble products over tens of millimetres. Drawing upon data we build a mathematical model that recapitulates experimental results and captures the interactions between biological, chemical and physical processes.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis work reveals a new bacterial behaviour that manifests at the air-liquid interface, which depends on production of cellulose, and hints to hitherto unrecognised dimensions to bacterial life at surfaces. Additionally, the study links activation of known diguanylate cyclase-encoding pathways to cellulose expression and to signals encountered at the air-liquid interface. Further significance stems from recognition of the consequences of fluid instabilities arising from surface production of cellulose for transport of water-soluble products over large distances.",

Recent research indicates that gender, age and identity of faces can be decoded from EEG/MEG data within 100ms. Yet the time course and neural circuitry involved in representing the personal relevance of faces remain unknown. We applied simultaneous EEG-fMRI to examine neural responses to emotional faces of female participants romantic partners, friends, and a stranger. Combining EEG and fMRI in cross-modal representational similarity analyses, we provide evidence that representations of personal relevance start prior to structural encoding at 100ms, with correlated representations in visual cortex, but also in prefrontal and midline regions involved in value representation, and monitoring and recall of self-relevant information. Our results add to an emerging body of research that suggests that models of face perception need to be updated to account for rapid detection of personal relevance in cortical circuitry beyond the core face processing network.",

Silencing requires piRNA-guided targeting of nuclear PIWI proteins to nascent transposon transcripts, yet the subsequent molecular events are not understood. Here, we identify SFiNX (Silencing Factor interacting Nuclear eXport variant), an interdependent protein complex required for Piwi-mediated co-transcriptional silencing in Drosophila. SFiNX consists of Nxf2-Nxt1, a gonad-specific variant of the heterodimeric mRNA export receptor Nxf1-Nxt1, and the Piwi-associated protein Panoramix. SFiNX mutant flies are sterile and exhibit transposon de-repression because piRNA-loaded Piwi is unable to establish heterochromatin. Within SFiNX, Panoramix recruits the heterochromatin effectors, while the RNA binding Nxf2 protein licenses co-transcriptional silencing. Our data reveal how Nxf2 evolved from an RNA transport receptor into a co-transcriptional silencing factor. Thus, NXF-variants, which are abundant in metazoans, can have diverse molecular functions and might have been co-opted for host genome defense more broadly.",

Using independent component analysis, we derived morphometric networks from a large, multi-cohort dataset, and investigated how GM volume within these networks differs in young adulthood, old adulthood, and AD. Aging and AD contributed additive effects on GM loss in nearly all networks, except frontal lobe networks, where GM reductions were more specific to aging. While no networks show GM loss highly specific to AD, a higher degree of variability in the whole-brain pattern of GM volume characterized AD only. Preservation of the whole-brain GM pattern in cognitively normal older adults was related to better cognition and lower risk of developing cognitive impairment. These results suggest both aging and AD involve widespread atrophy, but that cognitive impairment is uniquely associated with disruption of morphometric organization.",

Deep Learning methods such as convolutional neural networks can perform surprisingly good classifications on a variety of data types and the matrix-like gene expression profiles would seem to be ideal input data for deep learning approaches. In this short study I compiled training sets of expression data using the Arabidopsis AtGenExpress global stress expression data set and known transcription factor-target interactions from the Arabidopsis PLACE database. I built and optimised convolutional neural networks with a best model providing 95 % accuracy of classification on a held-out validation set. Investigation of the activations within this model revealed that classification was based on positive correlation of expression profiles in short sections. This result shows that a convolutional neural network can be used to make classifications and reveal the basis of those calssifications for gene expression data sets, indicating that a convolutional neural network is a useful and interpretable tool for exploratory classification of biological data.

In spite of an abundance of competing sensory stimuli, the detection of the most salient ones occurs without effort, and that detection contributes to the guidance of adaptive behavior. Neurons sensitive to the salience of visual stimuli are widespread throughout the primate visual system and are thought to shape the selection of visual targets. However, mechanisms underlying the representation of salience remain elusive. Among the possible candidates are areas within posterior parietal cortex, which appear to be crucial in the control of visual attention and are thought to play a unique role in representing stimulus salience. Here we show that reversible inactivation of parietal cortex not only selectively reduces the representation of visual salience within the brain, but it also diminishes the influence of salience on visually guided behavior. These results demonstrate a distinct contribution of parietal areas to vision and visual attention.",

However, in plants, few mechanistic details are known about how molecular motors associate with their secretory cargo to support the ubiquitous processes of polarized growth and cell division. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a Physcomitrella patens library identified a RabE GTPase as an interactor of myosin XI and subsequently demonstrated all five RabE members interact with myosin XI. Consistent with a role in polarized transport, we observed RabE at the growing cell apex and at the expanding cell plate during cell division. An in vivo cross-correlation analysis of fluorescently tagged RabE and myosin XI revealed that both species are spatiotemporally coupled, demonstrating their simultaneous involvement in polarized growth. To determine if myosin XI and RabE are directly coupled, we first computationally predicted myosin XI:RabE interface through a homology modeling-directed approach. We identified a structurally conserved residue on myosin XI, V1422, that when mutated abolished RabE binding in the yeast two-hybrid system and resulted in unpolarized plants instead of the characteristic network of filamentous cells when regenerated from single cells. Together, this work demonstrates the requirement of a direct myosin XI:RabE interaction for polarized growth in plants.",

    "abstract": "The coordination of growth during development establishes proportionality within and among the different anatomic structures of organisms. Innate memory of this proportionality is preserved, as shown in the ability of regenerating structures to return to their original size. Although the regulation of this coordination is incompletely understood, mutant analyses of zebrafish with long-finned phenotypes have uncovered important roles for bioelectric signaling in modulating growth and size of the fins and barbs. To date, long-finned mutants identified are caused by hypermorphic mutations, leaving unresolved whether such signaling is required for normal development. We isolated a new zebrafish mutant, schleier, with proportional overgrowth phenotypes caused by a missense mutation and loss of function in the K+-Cl- cotransporter Kcc4a. Genetic depletion of Kcc4a in wild-type fish leads to a dose-dependent loss of growth restriction in fins and barbs, supporting a requirement for Kcc4a in regulation of proportion. Epistasis experiments suggest that Kcc4a and the two-pore potassium channel Kcnk5b both contribute to a common bioelectrical signaling response in the fin. These data suggest that an integrated bioelectric signaling pathway is required for the coordination of size and proportion during development.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=145 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/621243v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ba7b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e3df5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105b878org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@920b54_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Despite many years of research and a few success stories with gene therapeutics, efficient and safe DNA delivery remains a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of gene-based therapies. Gene transfection with calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles brings the advantages of low toxicity, high DNA entrapment efficiency and good endosomal escape properties. The macroscale aggregation of CaP nanoparticles can be easily prevented through surface coating with bisphosphonate conjugates. Bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, recently showed promising anticancer effects. However, their poor cellular permeability and preferential bone accumulation hamper their full application in chemotherapy. Here, we investigated the dual delivery of plasmid DNA and alendronate using CaP nanoparticles, with the goal to facilitate cellular internalization of both compounds and potentially achieve a combined pharmacological effect on the same or different cell lines. A pH-sensitive poly(ethylene glycol)-alendronate conjugate was synthetized and used to formulate stable plasmid DNA-loaded CaP nanoparticles. These particles displayed good transfection efficiency in cancer cells and a strong cytotoxic effect on macrophages. The in vivo transfection efficiency, however, remained low, calling for an improvement of the system, possibly with respect to the extent of particle uptake and their physical stability.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/621102v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (29K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5f5d56org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8bc5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a6f000org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d690d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The signaling ligand (p)ppGpp binds diverse targets across bacteria, yet the mechanistic and evolutionary basis underlying these ligand-protein interactions remains poorly understood. Here we identify a novel (p)ppGpp binding motif in the enzyme HPRT, where (p)ppGpp shares identical binding residues for PRPP and nucleobase substrates to regulate purine homeostasis. Intriguingly, HPRTs across species share the conserved binding site yet strongly differ in ligand binding, from strong inhibition by basal (p)ppGpp levels to weak regulation at induced concentrations. Surprisingly, strong ligand binding requires an HPRT dimer-dimer interaction that allosterically opens the (p)ppGpp pocket. This dimer-dimer interaction is absent in the common ancestor but evolved to favor (p)ppGpp binding in the vast majority of bacteria. We propose that the evolutionary plasticity of oligomeric interfaces enables allosteric adjustment of ligand regulation, bypassing constraints of the ligand binding site. Since most ligands bind near protein-protein interfaces, this principle likely extends to other protein-ligand interactions.",

Depletion of TLK activity caused replication stress, increased chromosomal instability and cell arrest or death. Here, we show that stalled forks in TLK depleted cells are processed by BLM, SAMHD1 and the MRE11 nuclease to generate ssDNA and activate checkpoint signaling. TLK depletion also impaired heterochromatin maintenance, inducing features of alternative lengthening of telomeres and increasing spurious expression of other repetitive elements, associated with impaired deposition of the histone variant H3.3. TLK depletion culminated in a BLM-dependent, STING-mediated innate immune response. In many human cancers, TLK1/2 expression correlated with signatures of chromosomal instability and anti-correlated with STING and innate and adaptive immune response signatures. Together, our results show that TLK activity protects replication forks from active processing, contributes to chromatin silencing and suppresses innate immune responses, suggesting that TLK amplification may protect chromosomally unstable cancers from immune detection.",

    "abstract": "Many microbes and fungi acquire the essential ion Fe3+ through the synthesis and secretion of high-affinity chelators termed siderophores. In Gram-negative bacteria, these ferric-siderophore complexes are actively taken up using highly specific TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) located in the outer bacterial membrane (OM). However, the detailed mechanism of how the inner-membrane protein TonB connects to the transporters in the OM as well as the interplay between siderophore- and TonB-binding to the transporter is still poorly understood. Here, we present three crystal structures of the TBDT FoxA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (containing a signalling domain) in complex with the siderophore ferrioxamine B and TonB and combine them with a detailed analysis of binding constants. The structures show that both siderophore and TonB-binding is required to form a translocation-competent state of the FoxA transporter in a two-step TonB-binding mechanism. The complex structure also indicates how TonB-binding influences the orientation of the signalling domain.",

DNV containing enhancers were associated with genes that show preferential expression in the pre-frontal cortex, have been previously implicated in ID or related disorders, and exhibit intolerance to loss of function variants. DNVs from ID probands preferentially disrupted putative binding sites of neuronal transcription factors, as compared to DNVs from healthy individuals and most showed allele-specific enhancer activity. In addition, we identified recurrently mutated enhancer clusters that regulate genes involved in nervous system development (CSMD1, OLFM1 and POU3F3). Moreover, CRISPR-based perturbation of a DNV-containing enhancer caused CSMD1 overexpression and abnormal expression of neurodevelopmental regulators.\\n\\nConclusionOur results, therefore, provide new evidence to indicate that DNVs in constrained fetal brain-specific enhancers play a role in the etiology of ID.",

    "abstract": "Variation in the conspicuousness of colour patterns is observed within and among defended prey species. The evolution of conspicuous colour pattern in defended species can be strongly impaired because of increased detectability by predators. Nevertheless, such evolution of the colour pattern can be favoured if changes in conspicuousness result in Mullerian mimicry with other defended prey. Here, we develop a model describing the population dynamics of a conspicuous defended prey species, and we assess the invasion conditions of derived phenotypes that differ from the ancestral phenotype by their conspicuousness. Such change in conspicuousness may then modify their level of mimicry with the local community of defended species. Derived colour pattern displayed in this focal population can therefore be either exactly similar, partially resembling or completely dissimilar to the local mimicry ring displaying the ancestral colour pattern. We assume that predation risk depends (1) on the number of individuals sharing a given colour pattern within the population, (2) on the occurrence of co-mimetic defended species, and (3) on the availability of alternative edible prey. Using a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we show that less conspicuous colour patterns are generally favoured within mimicry rings, unless reduced conspicuousness impairs mimicry. By contrast, when a mutation affecting the colour pattern leads to a shift toward a better protected mimicry ring, crypsis is no longer necessarily beneficial and a more conspicuous colour pattern can be favoured. The selected aposematic pattern then depends on the local composition of mimetic communities, as well as on the detectability, memorability and level of mimicry of the colour patterns.",

Even though investigations of their role in children with ASD are incipient, the nutritional aspects and eating difficulties that these patients may present are increasingly highlighted, often leading to inadequate nutritional status. This cross-sectional controlled study investigated the levels of adipokines in ASD children in comparison with healthy controls, and their correlations with nutritional aspects and lipid profile. A total of 80 participants (40 ASD and 40 controls) were included and evaluated through anthropometric variables, body composition, and blood samples. ASD participants showed higher levels of leptin, no changes of adiponectin levels in comparison with typically developing children, and a positive correlation between leptin and fat mass. This novel finding supports the role of leptin as a marker of adiposity in ASD children, which is reiterated by the higher leptin/adiponectin ratio and its correlation with fat mass in patients. Inverse correlation of leptin with HDL-cholesterol could only in certain cases be related to the higher adiposity in patients when compared to controls.

While human sources have been examined within single-family households or in public environments, it is unclear what effect a large number of cohabitating people have on the microbial communities of their shared environment. We sampled the public and private spaces of a college dormitory, disentangling individual microbial signatures and their impact on the microbiota of common spaces. We compared multiple methods for marker gene sequence clustering, and found that Minimum Entropy Decomposition (MED) was best able to distinguish between the microbial signatures of different individuals, and was able to uncover more discriminative taxa across all taxonomic groups. Further, weighted UniFrac- and random forest-based graph analyses uncovered two distinct spheres of hand or shoe associated samples. For hand-associated samples, connection between cliques was enriched for hands, implicating them as a primary means of transmission. By contrast, shoe-associated samples were found to be freely interacting, with individual shoes more connected to each other than to the floors they interact with. Individual interactions were highly dynamic, with groups of samples originating from individuals clustering freely with other individuals, while all floor and shoe samples consistently clustered together.\\n\\nImportanceHumans leave behind a microbial trail, regardless of intention. This may allow for the identification of individuals based on the  microbial signatures they shed in built environments. In a shared living environment, these trails intersect, and through interaction with common surfaces may become homogenized, potentially confounding our ability to link individuals to their associated microbiota. We sought to understand the factors that influence the mixing of individual signatures, and how best to process sequencing data to best tease apart these signatures.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma gallisepticum, an avian-pathogenic bacterium, glides on host tissue surfaces by using a common motility system with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In the present study, we observed and analyzed the gliding behaviors of M. gallisepticum in detail by using optical microscopes. M. gallisepticum glided at a speed of 0.27 {+/-} 0.09 {micro}m/s with directional changes relative to the cell axis of 0.6 {+/-} 44.6 degrees/5 s without the rolling of the cell body. To examine the effects of viscosity on gliding, we analyzed the gliding behaviors under viscous environments. The gliding speed was constant in various concentrations of methylcellulose but was affected by Ficoll. To investigate the relationship between binding and gliding, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of sialyllactose on binding and gliding. The binding and gliding speed sigmoidally decreased with sialyllactose concentration, indicating the cooperative binding of the cell. To determine the direct energy source of gliding, we used a membrane-permeabilized ghost model. We permeabilized M. gallisepticum cells with Triton X-100 or Triton X-100 containing ATP and analyzed the gliding of permeabilized cells. The cells permeabilized with Triton X-100 did not show gliding; in contrast, the cells permeabilized with Triton X-100 containing ATP showed gliding at a speed of 0.014 {+/-} 0.007 m/s. These results indicate that the direct energy source for the gliding motility of M. gallisepticum is ATP.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMycoplasmas, the smallest bacteria, are parasitic and occasionally commensal. Mycoplasma gallisepticum is related to human pathogenic Mycoplasmas--Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium--which causes so-called  walking pneumonia and non-gonococcal urethritis, respectively. These Mycoplasmas trap sialylated oligosaccharides, which are common targets among influenza viruses, on host trachea or urinary tract surfaces and glide to enlarge the infected areas. Interestingly, this gliding motility is not related to other bacterial motilities or eukaryotic motilities. Here, we quantitatively analyze cell behaviors in gliding and clarify the direct energy source. The results provide clues for elucidating this unique motility mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Humans observe a wide range of actions in their surroundings. How is the visual cortex organized to process this diverse input? Using functional neuroimaging, we measured brain responses while participants viewed short videos of everyday actions, then probed the structure in these responses using voxel-wise encoding modeling. Responses were well fit by feature spaces that capture the body parts involved in an action and the actions targets (i.e. whether the action was directed at an object, another person, the actor, and space). Clustering analyses revealed five large-scale networks that summarized the voxel tuning: one related to social aspects of an action, and four related to the scale of the interaction envelope, ranging from fine-scale manipulations directed at objects, to large-scale whole-body movements directed at distant locations. We propose that these networks reveal the major representational joints in how actions are processed by visual regions of the brain.\n\nSignificance StatementHow does the brain perceive other peoples actions? Prior work has established that much of the visual cortex is active when observing others actions. However, this activity reflects a wide range of processes, from identifying a movements direction to recognizing its social content. We investigated how these diverse processes are organized within the visual cortex. We found that five networks respond during action observation: one that is involved in processing actions social content, and four that are involved in processing agent-object interactions and the scale of the effect that these actions have on the world (its \"interaction envelope\"). Based on these findings, we propose that sociality and interaction envelope size are two of the major features that organize action perception in the visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Neuron morphology is recognized as a key determinant of cell type, yet the quantitative profiling of a mammalian neurons complete three-dimensional (3-D) morphology remains arduous when the neuron has complex arborization and long projection. Whole-brain reconstruction of neuron morphology is even more challenging as it involves processing tens of teravoxels of imaging data. Validating such reconstructions is extremely laborious. We developed TeraVR, an open-source virtual reality annotation system, to address these challenges. TeraVR integrates immersive and collaborative 3-D visualization, interaction, and hierarchical streaming of teravoxel-scale images. Using TeraVR, we produced precise 3-D full morphology of long-projecting neurons in whole mouse brains and developed a collaborative workflow for highly accurate neuronal reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Oxpeckers (Buphagus sp.) are two bird species closely associated to large mammals, including giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis). We tested whether oxpeckers distributed themselves at random across individuals or aggregated on individual giraffes, and if birds select the hosts body parts with the expected greatest amount of ticks. By counting oxpeckers on giraffes body from photographs, we quantified the distribution of birds per hosts and over predefined zones on the giraffe body. Oxpeckers displayed a strong aggregation behaviour with few hosts carrying many birds while many carried a limited number or no birds, a pattern that was most exaggerated for males. Oxpeckers were disproportionately found on the mane and back, where the density of ticks is presumably the highest. This high aggregation level of birds is typical of parasitic species and could suggest that oxpecker distribution may mirror the distribution of ticks, their primary food resource, on giraffes. Abundance of ticks appears as a major driver of the oxpecker foraging behaviour, and the oxpecker-large herbivores system proves to be highly relevant for the study of host-parasite dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The role of Zika virus (ZIKV) immunity on subsequent dengue virus (DENV) infections is relevant to anticipate the dynamics of forthcoming DENV epidemics in areas with previous ZIKV exposure. We study the effect of ZIKV infection with various strains on subsequent DENV immune response after 10 and 2 months of ZIKV infection in rhesus macaques. Our results show that a subsequent DENV infection in animals with early- and middle-convalescent periods to ZIKV do not promote an increase in DENV viremia nor pro-inflammatory status. Previous ZIKV exposure increases the magnitude of the antibody and T cell responses against DENV, and different time intervals between infections alter the magnitude and durability of such responses--more after longer ZIKV pre-exposure. Collectively, we find no evidence of a detrimental effect of ZIKV immunity in a subsequent DENV infection. This supports the implementation of ZIKV vaccines that could also boost immunity against future DENV epidemics.",

    "abstract": "A significant portion of prescription opioid users self-administer orally rather than intravenously. Animal models of opioid addiction have demonstrated that intravenous cues are sufficient to cause drug-seeking. However, intravenous models may not model oral users, and the preference to self-administer orally appears to be partially influenced by the users sex. Our objectives were to determine whether oral opioid-associated cues are sufficient for relapse and whether sex differences exist in relapse susceptibility. Mice orally self-administered escalating doses of oxycodone under postprandial (prefed) or non-postprandial (no prefeeding) conditions. Both sexes demonstrated robust cue-induced reinstatement. In separate mice we found that oral oxycodone cues were sufficient to reinstate extinguished oral oxycodone-seeking behavior in the absence of postprandial or prior water self-administration training. During self-administration, we found that female mice earned significantly more mg/kg oxycodone than male mice. Follow-up studies indicated sex differences in psychomotor stimulation and plasma oxycodone/oxymorphone following oral oxycodone administration. In addition, gonadal steroid studies were performed in which we found divergent responses where ovariectomy enhanced and orchiectomy suppressed oral self-administration. While the suppressive effects of orchiectomy were identified across doses and postprandial conditions, the enhancing effects of ovariectomy were selective to non-postprandial conditions. These studies establish that 1) oral drug cues are sufficient to cause reinstatement that is independent of prandial conditions and water-seeking behavior, 2) earned oral oxycodone is larger in female mice compared with male mice potentially through differences in psychomotor stimulation and drug metabolism, and 3) gonadectomy produces divergent effects on oral oxycodone self-administration between sexes.",

    "abstract": "Predicting how species will respond to selection pressures requires understanding the factors that constrain their evolution. We use genome engineering of Drosophila to investigate constraints on the repeated evolution of unrelated herbivorous insects to toxic cardiac glycosides, which primarily occurs via a small subset of possible functionally-relevant substitutions to Na+,K+-ATPase. Surprisingly, we find that frequently observed adaptive substitutions at two sites, 111 and 122, are lethal when homozygous and adult heterozygotes exhibit dominant neural dysfunction. We identify a phylogenetically correlated substitution, A119S, that partially ameliorates the deleterious effects of substitutions at 111 and 122. Despite contributing little to cardiac glycoside-insensitivity in vitro, A119S, like substitutions at 111 and 122, substantially increases adult survivorship upon cardiac glycoside exposure. Our results demonstrate the importance of epistasis in constraining adaptive paths. Moreover, by revealing distinct effects of substitutions in vitro and in vivo, our results underscore the importance of evaluating the fitness of adaptive substitutions and their interactions in whole organisms.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveLate-life depression is associated with an increased risk for dementia, but our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying this association is limited. Hence, the authors investigated whether microRNAs, important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, contribute to this association.\\n\\nMethodLate-life depressive symptoms were assessed annually in 300 non-demented participants of the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project for a mean of seven years using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Participants underwent annual cognitive testing, clinical assessment of cognitive status, and uniform neuropathologic examination after death. microRNAs were profiled from the prefrontal cortex using Nanostring platform. A global microRNA association study of late-life depressive symptoms was performed using linear mixed model adjusting for sex, age, Alzheimers dementia pathological burden, proportions of brain cell types, post-mortem interval, and RNA integrity.\\n\\nResultsFour brain microRNAs were associated with late-life depressive symptoms at adjusted p<0.05 (miR-484, miR-26b, miR-30d, and miR-197). Lower expressions of these miRNAs were associated with greater depressive symptoms. Furthermore, lower expressions of miR-484 and miR-197 were associated with faster decline of cognitive performance over time. Additionally, lower miR-484 level was associated with higher probability of having Alzheimers dementia. Lastly, the predicted targets of miR-484 were enriched in a brain protein co-expression module involving synaptic transmission and regulation of long-term neuronal synaptic plasticity.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first study to identify brain microRNAs associated with late-life depressive symptoms assessed longitudinally. Additionally, the authors found a link between late-life depressive symptoms and dementia through miR-484 and miR-197.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the molecular mechanisms that give rise to genetic variation is essential for the understanding of evolutionary processes. Previously, we have used adaptive laboratory evolution to enable biomass synthesis from CO2 in E. coli. Genetic analysis of adapted clones from two independently evolving populations revealed distinct enrichment for insertion and deletion mutational events. Here, we follow these observations to show that mutations in the gene encoding for DNA Topoisomerase 1 (topA) give rise to mutator phenotypes with characteristic mutational spectra. Using genetic assays and mutation accumulation lines, we show that point mutations in topA increase the rate of sequence deletion and duplication events. Interestingly, we observe that a single residue substitution (R168C) results in a high rate of head-to-tail (tandem) short sequence duplications, which are independent of existing sequence repeats. Finally, we show that the unique mutation spectrum of topA mutants enhances the emergence of antibiotic resistance in comparison to mismatch-repair (mutS) mutators, and lead to new resistance genotypes. Our findings highlight a potential link between the catalytic activity of topoisomerases and the fundamental question regarding the emergence of de novo tandem repeats, which are known modulators of bacterial evolution.",
