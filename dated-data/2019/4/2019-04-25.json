    "abstract": "Accurate kinship predictions using DNA forensic samples has utility for investigative leads, remains identification, identifying relationships between individuals of interest, etc. High throughput sequencing (HTS) of STRs and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is enabling the characterization of larger numbers of loci. Large panels of SNP loci have been proposed for improved mixture analysis of forensic samples. While multiple kinship prediction approaches have been established, we present an approach focusing on these large HTS SNP panels for predicting degree of kinship predictions. Formulas for first degree relatives can be multiplied (chained) together to model extended kinship relationships. Predictions are made using these formulations by calculating log likelihood ratios and selecting the maximum likelihood across the possible relationships. With a panel of 30,000 SNPs evaluated on an in silico dataset, this method can resolve parents from siblings and distinguish 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree relatives from each other and unrelated individuals.",

    "abstract": "Molecular ecologists frequently use genome reduction strategies that rely upon restriction enzyme digestion of genomic DNA to sample consistent portions of the genome from many individuals (e.g., RADseq, GBS). However, researchers often find the existing methods expensive to initiate and/or difficult to implement consistently, especially due to the inability to highly-multiplex samples to fill entire sequencing lanes. Here, we introduce a low-cost and highly robust approach for the construction of dual-digest RADseq libraries that relies on adapters and primers designed in Adapterama I. Major features of our method include: 1) minimizing the number of processing steps; 2) focusing on a single strand of sample DNA for library construction, allowing the use of a non-phosphorylated adapter on one end; 3) ligating adapters in the presence of active restriction enzymes, thereby reducing chimeras; 4) including an optional third restriction enzyme to cut apart adapter-dimers formed by the phosphorylated adapter, thus increasing the efficiency of adapter ligation to sample DNA, which is particularly effective when only low quantity/quality DNA samples are available; 5) interchangeable adapter designs; 6) incorporating variable-length internal indexes within the adapters to increase the scope of sample indexing, facilitate pooling, and increase sequence diversity; 7) maintaining compatibility with universal dual-indexed primers and thus, Illumina sequencing reagents and libraries; and, 8) easy modification for the identification of PCR duplicates. We present eight adapter designs that work with 72 restriction enzyme combinations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by comparing it with existing methods, and we validate its utility through the discovery of many variable loci in a variety of non-model organisms. Our 2RAD/3RAD method is easy to perform, has low startup costs, has increased utility with low-concentration input DNA, and produces libraries that can be highly-multiplexed and pooled with other Illumina libraries.",

    "abstract": "Predicting evolution of expanding populations is critical to control biological threats such as invasive species and cancer metastasis. Expansion is primarily driven by reproduction and dispersal, but nature abounds with examples of evolution where organisms pay a reproductive cost to disperse faster. When does selection favor this  survival of the fastest? We searched for a simple rule, motivated by evolution experiments where swarming bacteria evolved into an hy-perswarmer mutant which disperses[~] 100% faster but pays a growth cost of [~] 10% to make many copies of its flagellum. We analyzed a two-species model based on the Fisher equation to explain this observation: the population expansion rate (v) results from an interplay of growth (r) and dispersal (D) and is independent of the carrying capacity: [Formula]. A mutant can take over the edge only if its expansion rate (v2) exceeds the expansion rate of the established species (v1); this simple condition (v2 > v1) determines the maximum cost in slower growth that a faster mutant can pay and still be able to take over. Numerical simulations and time-course experiments where we tracked evolution by imaging bacteria suggest that our findings are general: less favorable conditions delay but do not entirely prevent the success of the fastest. Thus, the expansion rate defines a traveling wave fitness, which could be combined with trade-offs to predict evolution of expanding populations.",

    "abstract": "Inter-subject correlation (ISC) based analysis is a conceptually simple approach to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired under naturalistic stimuli such as a movie. We describe and validate the statistical approaches for comparing ISCs between two groups of subjects implemented in the ISC toolbox, which is an open source software package for ISC-based analysis of fMRI data. The approaches are based on permutation tests. We validated the approaches using five different data sets from the ICBM functional reference battery tasks. First, we created five null datasets (one for each task) by dividing the subjects into two matched groups and assumed that no group difference exists. Second, based on one null dataset, we created datasets with simulated ISC differences of varying size between the two groups. Based on the experiments with these two types of data, we recommend the use of subject-wise permutations, instead of element-wise permutations. The tests based on subject-wise permutations led to correct false positive rates. We observed that the null-distributions should be voxel-specific and not based on pooling all voxels across the brain as is typical in fMRI. This was the case even if studentized permutation tests were used. Additionally, we experimented with an fMRI dataset acquired using a dance movie stimulus for comparison of a group of adult males on the autism spectrum to a matched typically developed group. The experiment confirmed the differences between voxel-based permutation tests and global model based permutation tests.",

    "abstract": "When organisms coevolve, any change in one species can induce phenotypic changes in traits and ecology of the other species. The role such interactions play in ecosystems is central, but their mechanistic bases remain underexplored. Upper trophic level species have to synchronize their life-cycle to both abiotic conditions and to lower trophic level species phenology and phenotypic variations. We tested the effect of host seasonal strategy on parasitoid diapause induction by using a holocyclic clone of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum producing asexual and sexual morphs that are viviparous females (i.e. laying embryos) and oviparous females (laying eggs), respectively, the latter being only present at the end of the growing season. Aphidius ervi parasitoids from populations of contrasted climatic origin (harsh vs. mild winter areas) were allowed to parasitize each morph in a split-brood design and developing parasitoids were next reared under either fall-like or summer-like temperature-photoperiod conditions. We next examined aspects of the host physiological state by comparing the relative proportion of forty-seven metabolites and lipid reserves in both morphs produced under the same conditions. We found that oviparous morphs are cues per se for diapause induction; parasitoids entered diapause at higher levels when developing in oviparous hosts (19.4 {+/-} 3.0%) than in viviparous ones (3.6 {+/-} 1.3%), under summer-like conditions (i.e., when oviparous aphids appear in the fields). This pattern was only observed in parasitoids from the harsh winter area since low diapause levels were observed in the other population, suggesting local adaptations to overwintering cues. Metabolomics analyses show parasitoids response to be mainly influenced by the hosts physiology, with higher proportion of polyols and sugars, and more fat reserves being found in oviparous morphs. Host quality thus varies across the seasons and represents one of the multiple environmental parameters affecting parasitoid diapause. Our results underline strong coevolutionary processes between hosts and parasitoids in their area of origin, likely leading to phenological synchronization, and we point out the importance of such bottom-up effects for trait expression, and for the provision of ecosystem services such as biological control in the context of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian models of behavior suggest that organisms represent uncertainty associated with sensory variables. However, the neural code of uncertainty remains elusive. A central hypothesis is that uncertainty is encoded in the population activity of cortical neurons in the form of likelihood functions. We studied the neural code of uncertainty by simultaneously recording population activity from the primate visual cortex during a visual categorization task in which trial-to-trial uncertainty about stimulus orientation was relevant for the decision. We decoded the likelihood function from the trial-to-trial population activity and found that it predicted decisions better than a point estimate of orientation. This remained true when we conditioned on the true orientation, suggesting that internal fluctuations in neural activity drive behaviorally meaningful variations in the likelihood function. Our results establish the role of population-encoded likelihood functions in mediating behavior, and provide a neural underpinning for Bayesian models of perception.",

    "abstract": "When people invest effort in cognitive work, they often keep an eye open for rewarding alternative activities. Previous research suggests that the norepinephrine (NE) system regulates such trade-offs between exploitation of the current task and exploration of alternative possibilities. Here we examine the possibility that the NE-system is involved in a related trade-off, i.e., the trade-off between cognitive labor and leisure. We conducted two pre-registered studies (total N = 62) in which participants freely chose to perform either a paid 2-back task (labor) vs. a non-paid task (leisure), while we tracked their pupil diameter--which is an indicator of the state of the NE system. In both studies, consistent with prior work, we found (a) increases in pupil baseline and (b) decreases in pupil dilation when participants switched from labor to leisure. Unexpectedly, we found the same pattern when participants switched from leisure back to labor. Both increases in pupil baseline and decreases in pupil dilation were short-lived. Collectively, these results are more consistent with a role of norepinephrine in reorienting attention and task switching, as suggested by network reset theory, than with a role in motivation, as suggested by adaptive gain theory.",

By using of Co-IP, Pull Down and SPR, the second PDZ (PDZ2) domain of FRMPD2 direct and binds to the C-terminus of GluN2A.

    "abstract": "The radial unit hypothesis provides a framework for global (proliferation) and regional (distribution) expansion of the primate cerebral cortex. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we have identified cortical regions with shared variance in their surface area and cortical thickness, respectively, segmented from magnetic resonance images obtained in 23,800 participants. We then carried out meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies of the first two principal components for each phenotype. For surface area (but not cortical thickness), we have detected strong associations between each of the components and single nucleotide polymorphisms in a number of gene loci. The first (global) component was associated mainly with loci on chromosome 17 (9.5e-32 [&le;] p [&le;] 2.8e-10), including those detected previously as linked with intracranial volume and/or general cognitive function. The second (regional) component captured shared variation in the surface area of the primary and adjacent secondary visual cortices and showed a robust association with polymorphisms in a locus on chromosome 14 containing Disheveled Associated Activator of Morphogenesis 1 (DAAM1; p=2.4e-34). DAAM1 is a key component in the planar-cell-polarity signaling pathway. In follow-up studies, we have focused on the latter finding and established that: (1) DAAM1 is highly expressed between 12th and 22nd post-conception weeks in the human cerebral cortex; (2) genes co-expressed with DAAM1 in the primary visual cortex are enriched in mitochondria-related pathways; and (3) volume of the lateral geniculate nucleus, which projects to regions of the visual cortex staining for cytochrome oxidase (a mitochondrial enzyme), correlates with the surface area of the visual cortex in major-allele homozygotes but not in carriers of the minor allele. Altogether, we speculate that, in concert with thalamocortical input to cortical subplate, DAAM1 enables migration of neurons to cytochrome-oxidase rich regions of the visual cortex, and, in turn, facilitates regional expansion of this set of cortical regions during development.",

    "abstract": "Many models of classical conditioning fail to describe important phenomena, notably the rapid return of fear after extinction. To address this shortfall, evidence converged on the idea that learning agents rely on latent-state inferences, i.e. an ability to index disparate associations from cues to rewards (or penalties) and infer which index (i.e. latent state) is presently active. Our goal was to develop a model of latent-state inferences that uses latent states to predict rewards from cues efficiently and that can describe behavior in a diverse set of experiments. The resulting model combines a Rescorla-Wagner rule, for which updates to associations are proportional to prediction error, with an approximate Bayesian rule, for which beliefs in latent states are proportional to prior beliefs and an approximate likelihood based on current associations. In simulation, we demonstrate the models ability to reproduce learning effects both famously explained and not explained by the Rescorla-Wagner model, including rapid return of fear after extinction, the Hall-Pearce effect, partial reinforcement extinction effect, backwards blocking, and memory modification. Lastly, we derive our model as an online algorithm to maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrating it is an efficient approach to outcome prediction. Establishing such a framework is a key step towards quantifying normative and pathological ranges of latent-state inferences in various contexts.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComputational researchers are increasingly interested in a structured form of learning known as latent-state inferences. Latent-state inferences is a type of learning that involves categorizing, generalizing, and recalling disparate associations between observations in ones environment and is used in situations when the correct association is latent or unknown. This type of learning has been used to explain overgeneralization of a fear memory and the cognitive role of certain brain regions important to cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry. Accordingly, latent-state inferences are an important area of inquiry. Through simulation and theory, we establish a new model of latent-state inferences. Moving forward, we aim to use this framework to measure latent-state inferences in healthy and psychiatric populations.",

We demonstrate specific labelling of organelles using degron-tagged reporters, including extracellular vesicles, as well as individual neighbouring membranes. These degron-tagged reporters facilitate long-term tracking of released cell debris and cell corpses, even during uptake and phagolysosomal degradation. We further show that degron protection assays can probe the topology of the nuclear envelope and plasma membrane during cell division, giving insight into protein and organelle dynamics. As endogenous and heterologous degrons are used in bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals, degron approaches can enable the specific labelling and tracking of proteins, vesicles, organelles, cell fragments, and cells in many model systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong-range functional connectivity in the brain is considered fundamental for cognition and is known to be altered in many neuropsychiatric disorders. To modify such coupling independent of sensory input, noninvasive brain stimulation could be of utmost value.\n\nObjectiveFirst, we tested if transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is able to influence functional connectivity in the human brain. Second, we investigated the specificity of effects in frequency and space.\n\nMethodsEEG aftereffects of bifocal high-definition tACS were analyzed systematically in sensor and source space. Participants were stimulated transcranially in counterbalanced order (1) in-phase, with identical electric fields in both hemispheres, (2) anti-phase, with phase-reversed electric fields in the two hemispheres, and (3) jittered-phase, generated by subtle frequency shifts continuously changing the phase relation between the two fields.\n\nResultsWhile total power and spatial distribution of the fields were comparable between conditions, global pre-post stimulation changes in EEG connectivity were larger after in-phase stimulation than after anti-phase or jittered-phase stimulation. Those differences in connectivity were restricted to the stimulated frequency band and decayed within the first 120 s after stimulation offset. Source reconstruction localized the maximum effect between the stimulated occipitoparietal areas.\n\nConclusionThe relative phase of bifocal alpha-tACS modulated alpha-band connectivity between the targeted regions. As side effects did not differ between stimulation conditions, we conclude that neural activity was phase-specifically influenced by the electric fields. We thus suggest bifocal high-definition tACS as a tool to manipulate long-range cortico-cortical coupling which outlasts the stimulation period.",

    "abstract": "Cells respond to protein-damaging insults by activating heat shock factors (HSFs), key transcription factors of proteostasis. Abnormal HSF protein levels occur in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of the tight control of HSF expression. HSF2 is a short-lived protein, but it is abundant in the prenatal brain cortex and required for brain development. Here, we reveal that HSF2 is acetylated and co-localized with the lysine-acetyl transferases CBP and EP300 in human brain organoids. Using unbiased, biochemical, cell-imaging, and in silico approaches, we show that CBP/EP300 acetylates HSF2 at specific lysine residues, which promotes HSF2 stabilization, whereas the lysine deacetylase HDAC1 catalyzes its proteasomal degradation. The CBP KIX domain and KlX-recognizing motifs in HSF2 are critical for its interaction with acetylating enzymes. The functional importance of acetylated HSF2 is evidenced in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), characterized by mutated CBP or EP300. We show that RSTS patient cells exhibit decreased HSF2 levels and impaired heat shock response. The dysregulated HSF pathway in RSTS opens new avenues for understanding the molecular basis of this multifaceted pathology.",

    "abstract": "External perturbation forces may compromise standing balance. The nervous system can intervene only after a delay greater than 100 ms, during which the body falls freely. With ageing, sensorimotor delays are prolonged, posing a critical threat to balance. We study a generic model of stabilisation with neural delays to understand how the organism should adapt to challenging balance conditions. The model suggests that ankle stiffness should be increased in anticipation of perturbations, for example by muscle co-contraction, so as to slow down body fall during the neural response delay. Increased ankle muscle co-contraction is indeed observed in young adults when standing in challenging balance conditions, and in older relative to young adults during normal stance. In parallel, the analysis of the model shows that increases in either stiffness or neural delay must be coordinated with decreases in spinal sensorimotor gains, otherwise the feedback itself becomes destabilizing. Accordingly, a decrease in spinal feedback is observed in challenging conditions, and with age-related increases in neural delay. These observations have been previously interpreted as indicating an increased reliance on cortical rather than spinal control of balance, despite the fact that cortical responses have a longer latency. Our analysis challenges this interpretation by showing that these observations are consistent with a functional coadaptation of spinal feedback gains to functional changes in stiffness and neural delay.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBeing able to stand still can be difficult when faced with an unexpected push. It takes the nervous system more than a tenth of a second to respond to such a perturbation, and during this delay the body falls under the influence of its own weight. By co-contracting their ankle muscles in anticipation of a perturbation, subjects can increase their ankle stiffness, which slows down their fall during the neural delay. Young subjects indeed adopt this strategy when they need to remain particularly still (for example when they stand in front of a cliff). Older subjects adopt this strategy even during normal standing. We present a model of standing balance that shows that this postural strategy provides partial compensation for the increase in neural delays with ageing. According to our model, increasing ankle stiffness only improves balance if it is accompanied by a decrease in sensorimotor gain. This provides a novel and functional interpretation for the decrease in spinal feedback observed during ageing, and observed in young subjects when they stand in challenging balance conditions.",

    "abstract": "Platelet integrin lIb{beta}3 plays a critical role in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Current IIb{beta}3 antagonists are potent anti-thrombotic drugs, but also cause adverse outcomes, which limited their clinical use. Drug-induced serious bleeding, thrombocytopenia and paradoxical thrombosis have been linked to impaired clot retraction and to conformational changes in IIb{beta}3 that promote binding of preformed antibodies, natural ligands or both to IIb{beta}3. We have used structure-guided design to generate the orthosteric inhibitor Hr10 that acts as a pure IIb{beta}3 antagonist, i.e. it does not induce the conformational changes in IIb{beta}3. Hr10 is as effective as the partial agonist drug eptifibatide in blocking platelet aggregation and arteriolar thrombosis in mice. In contrast to eptifibatide, however, Hr10 preserved thrombin-induced clot retraction, suggesting that it may not perturb hemostasis. Our structure-based approach can find general utility in designing pure orthosteric inhibitors for other integrins, in providing vital tools for dissecting structure-activity relationships in IIb{beta}3, and potentially in offering safer alternatives for human therapy.",

    "abstract": "Pyrazinamide is one of four first-line antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis, however antibiotic susceptibility testing for pyrazinamide is problematic. Resistance to pyrazinamide is primarily driven by genetic variation in pncA, an enzyme that converts pyrazinamide into its active form. We curated a derivation dataset of 291 non-redundant, missense amino acid mutations in pncA with associated high-confidence phenotypes from published studies and then trained three different machine learning models to predict pyrazinamide resistance based on sequence- and structure-based features of each missense mutation. The clinical performance of the models was estimated by predicting the binary pyrazinamide resistance phenotype of 2,292 clinical isolates harboring missense mutations in pncA. Overall, this work offers an approach to improve the sensitivity/specificity of pyrazinamide resistance prediction in genetics-based clinical microbiology workflows, highlights novel mutations for future biochemical investigation, and is a proof of concept for using this approach in other drugs such as bedaquiline.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements in crop plants are the powerful drivers of phenotypic variation that has been selected during domestication and breeding programs. In tomato, transpositions of the LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposon family Rider have contributed to various phenotypes of agronomical interest, such as fruit shape and colour. However, the mechanisms regulating Rider activity are largely unknown. We have developed a bioinformatics pipeline for the functional annotation of retrotransposons containing LTRs and defined all full-length Rider elements in the tomato genome. Subsequently, we showed that accumulation of Rider transcripts and transposition intermediates in the form of extrachromosomal DNA is triggered by drought stress and relies on abscisic acid signalling. We provide evidence that residual activity of Rider is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms involving siRNAs and the RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway. Finally, we demonstrate the broad distribution of Rider-like elements in other plant species, including crops. Thus our work identifies Rider as an environment-responsive element and a potential source of genetic and epigenetic variation in plants.",

    "abstract": "The jaguar (Panthera onca) is widely distributed across a broad range of habitat types, where its feeding habits and habitat use patterns vary significantly. The jaguar and its main arboreal prey - the brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) and the red howler monkey (Alouatta juara) - are widespread in the Amazonian floodplain forests of the Mamiraua Reserve. These forest-dwelling species are the most common mammal species both in the continuous forest and the forest patches surrounded by a river matrix - the fluvial islands - of the Solimoes and Japura rivers. We used sign surveys along line-transects to assess the pattern of habitat occupancy by jaguars in Amazonian floodplain forests. Specifically, we (i) tested whether habitat occupancy by jaguars differs between river islands and continuous forest; and (ii) evaluated whether and how the local abundance of sloths and howler monkeys influence the probability of site occupancy by jaguars. We built an occupancy model and used Bayesian inference to reach these goals. The proportion of sites estimated to be used by jaguars was{psi} = 0.75 (HPD95: 0.36-1.00), and it did not differ between islands and continuous forest. The abundance of both prey species had a direct influence on jaguars habitat use, whereas the aquatic matrix seems to have a negligible effect on the use of islands by jaguars. We conclude that the isolation of the river islands within the aquatic matrix does not hamper jaguars to use them. We also conclude that prey search modulates jaguars habitat occupancy patterns with both prey species having a similar effect. This finding is compatible with the previously reported importance of sloths to the diet of jaguars in the study region despite its lower abundance than howlers. Finally, we suggest that sign surveys are an alternative method to assess the pattern of jaguar habitat occupancy in floodplain forests.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM; grade 4 glioma) is a highly aggressive and incurable tumor. GBM has recently been characterized as highly dependent on alternative splicing, a critical driver of tumor heterogeneity and plasticity. Estrogen-related receptor beta (ERR{beta}, ESRRB, NR3B2) is an orphan nuclear receptor expressed in the brain, where alternative splicing of the 3 end of the pre-mRNA leads to the production of three validated ERR{beta} protein products - ERR{beta} short form (ERR{beta}sf), ERR{beta}2, and ERR{beta} exon 10-deleted (ERR{beta}-{Delta}10). Our prior studies have shown the ERR{beta}2 isoform to play a role in G2/M cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis, in contrast to the function of the shorter ERR{beta}sf isoform in senescence and G1 cell cycle arrest. In this study, we sought to better define the role of the pro-apoptotic ERR{beta}2 isoform in GBM. We show that the ERR{beta}2 isoform is located in the nucleus, but also the cytoplasm. ERR{beta}2 suppresses GBM cell migration, interacts with the actin nucleation-promoting factor cortactin, and an ERR{beta} agonist is able to remodel the actin cytoskeleton and similarly suppress GBM cell migration. We further show that inhibition of the splicing regulatory cdc2-like kinases (CLKs) in combination with an ERR{beta} agonist shifts isoform expression in favor of ERR{beta}2 and potentiates inhibition of growth and migration in GBM cells and intracranial tumors.\n\nFinancial SupportThis work was supported by R21 CA191444 (RBR), a Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) Dean for Researchs Toulmin Pilot Project Award (RBR), and a Partners in Research Breakthrough Award (RBR), as well as F99 CA234799 (DMT) and a student research grant from the Medical Center Graduate Student Organization (MCGSO, to DMT).

    "abstract": "Hybrid offspring can look very different from their parents, including having greatly increased or decreased fitness. In many plant species, conflicts between divergent elements of the immune system can cause hybrids to express autoimmunity, a generally deleterious syndrome known as hybrid necrosis. We are investigating multiple hybrid necrosis cases in Arabidopsis thaliana that are caused by allele-specific interactions between different variants at two unlinked resistance (R) gene clusters. One is the RESISTANCE TO PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 7 (RPP7) cluster, which encodes an intracellular nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors that confer strain-specific resistance to oomycetes. The other is the RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8)/HOMOLOG OF RPW8 (HR) locus, which encodes atypical resistance proteins that can confer broad-spectrum resistance to filamentous pathogens. There is extensive structural variation in the RPW8/HR cluster, both at the level of gene copy number and at the level of C-terminal protein repeats of unknown function. We demonstrate that the number of RPW8/HR repeats correlate, albeit in a complex manner, with the severity of hybrid necrosis when these alleles are combined with specific RPP7 variants. This observation suggests that gross structural differences, rather than individual amino acid polymorphisms, guide the genetic interaction between RPW8/HR and RPP7 alleles. We discuss these findings in light of the similarity of RPW8/HR proteins with pore-forming toxins, MLKL and HET-S, from mammals and fungi.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic mechanistic models are essential to predictive epidemiology, to better explore biological assumptions and anticipate effects of control measures on pathogen spread. Their development is usually long and iterative, involving multi-disciplinary knowledge integration. However, knowledge often becomes lost in model code, hindering late changes in assumptions and often making models appearing as black boxes to end-users. We introduce here EMULSION, an artificial intelligence-based software intended to help modellers focus on model design rather than programming. EMULSION defines a domain-specific language to make all components of an epidemiological model (structure, processes, parameters...) explicit as a structured text file. This file is readable by scientists from other fields (epidemiologists, biologists, economists), who can contribute to validate or revise assumptions at any stage of model development. It is then automatically processed by EMULSION generic simulation engine, preventing any discrepancy between model description and implementation. The modelling language and simulation architecture both rely on the combination of advanced artificial intelligence methods (knowledge representation and multi-level agent-based simulation), allowing several modelling paradigms (from compartment- to individual-based models) at several scales (up to metapopulations). The flexibility of EMULSION and its capability to support iterative modelling are illustrated here through examples of progressive complexity, including late revisions of core model assumptions. EMULSION is also currently used to model the spread of several diseases in real pathosystems (zoonoses such as Q fever or the vector-borne Rift Valley fever; or bovine respiratory diseases, with a focus on detection and treatment protocols). EMULSION provides a command-line tool for checking models, producing model diagrams, running simulations, and plotting outputs. Implemented in Python 3, EMULSION runs on Linux, MacOS, and soon Windows. It is released under Apache-2.0 license.

    "abstract": "Synthetic promoters are commonly applied elements in circuit design for fine-tuning the protein expression levels. Promoter engineering was mostly focused on the random mutation or combination of regulation elements such as transcription factor binding sites. However, the size of promoter sequence space is still overwhelming and better navigation method is required. On the other hand, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is known for its great ability to reduce the searching space by learning to generate new data on the similar manifold of original data. Here, we applied WGAN-GP model into de novo promoter sequence design to generate entirely new promoter sequences. In total, 83 of model-generated promoter sequences were tested in promoter activity screening by regulating the expression of sfGFP gene in Escherichia coli. As a result, 26 out of 83 newly designed promoters were found functional and successfully expressed with varying activities, with similarity score to natural promoters all less than 0.7. Moreover, 3 of them showed higher promoter strength than the wild type promoters and their highly expression mutants. The much higher successful rate and promoter activity with much lower similarity score in our model-designed novel promoters confirmed the effectiveness of promoter sequence learning. Our work provides insights into an area of navigation of novel functional promoter sequence space automatically, as well as speeding up evolution process of naturally existing promoters, indicating the potential ability for deep generative models to be applied into genetic element designing in the future.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoplanktonic crinoid megaraft colonies are an enigma of the Jurassic. They are among the largest in-situ invertebrate accumulations ever to exist in the Phanerozoic fossil record. These megaraft colonies and are thought to have developed as floating filter-feeding communities due to an exceptionally rich relatively predator free oceanic niche, high in the water column enabling them to reach high densities on these log rafts. However, this pseudoplanktonic hypothesis has never actually been quantitatively tested and some researchers have cast doubt that this mode of life was even possible. The ecological structure of the crinoid colony is resolved using spatial point process techniques and its longevity using moisture diffusion models. Using spatial analysis we found that the crinoids would have trailed preferentially positioned at the back of migrating structures in the regions of least resistance, consistent with a floating, not benthic ecology. Additionally, we found using a series of moisture diffusion models at different log densities and sizes that ecosystem collapse did not take place solely due to colonies becoming overladen as previously assumed. We have found that these crinoid colonies studied could have existed for greater than 10 years, even up to 20 years exceeding the life expectancy of modern documented megaraft systems with implications for the role of modern raft communities in the biotic colonisation of oceanic islands and intercontinental dispersal of marine and terrestrial species.Significance statement Transoceanic rafting is the principle mechanism for the biotic colonisation of oceanic island ecosystems. However, no historic records exist of how long such biotic systems lasted. Here, we use a deep-time example from the Early Jurassic to test the viability of these pseudoplanktonic systems, resolving for the first time whether these systems were truly free floating planktonic and viable for long enough to allow its inhabitants to grow to maturity. Using spatial methods we show that these colonies have a comparable structure to modern marine pesudoplankton on maritime structures, whilst the application of methods normally used in commercial logging is used to demonstrate the viability of the system which was capable of lasting up to 20 years.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that neurons exhibit trial-by-trial correlated activity and that such noise correlations (NCs) greatly impact the accuracy of population codes. Meanwhile, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a mainstream approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but it remains unclear how NCs between voxels influence MVPA performance. Here, we tackle this issue by combining voxel-encoding modeling and MVPA. We focus on a well-established form of NC, tuning-compatible noise correlation (TCNC), whose sign and magnitude are systematically related to the tuning similarity between two units. We first replicate the classical finding that TCNCs impair population codes in a standard neuronal population. We then extend our analysis to fMRI data, and show that voxelwise TCNCs do not impair and can even improve MVPA performance when TCNCs are strong or the number of voxels is large. We also confirm these results using standard information-theoretic analyses in computational neuroscience. Further computational analyses demonstrate that the discrepancy between the effect of TCNCs in neuronal and voxel populations can be explained by tuning heterogeneity and pool sizes. Our results provide a theoretical foundation to understand the effect of correlated activity on population codes in macroscopic fMRI data. Our results also suggest that future fMRI research could benefit from a closer examination of the correlational structure of multivariate responses, which is not directly revealed by conventional MVPA approaches.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have provided evidence that late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD) can in part be considered a metabolic disease. Besides age, female sex and APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype represent strong risk factors for AD. They also both give rise to large metabolic differences, suggesting that metabolic aspects of AD pathogenesis may differ between males and females and between APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers and non-carriers. We systematically investigated group-specific metabolic alterations by conducting stratified association analyses of 140 metabolites measured in serum samples of 1,517 AD neuroimaging initiative subjects, with AD biomarkers for A{beta} and tau pathology and neurodegeneration. We observed substantial sex differences in effects of 15 metabolites on AD biomarkers with partially overlapping differences for APOE {varepsilon}4 status groups. These metabolites highlighted several group-specific alterations not observed in unstratified analyses using sex and APOE {varepsilon}4 as covariates. Combined stratification by both variables uncovered further subgroup-specific metabolic effects limited to the group with presumably the highest AD risk: APOE {varepsilon}4+ females. Pathways linked to the observed metabolic alterations suggest that females experience more expressed impairment of mitochondrial energy production in AD than males. These findings indicate that dissecting metabolic heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may enable grading of the biomedical relevance of specific pathways for specific subgroups. Extending our approach beyond simple one- or two-fold stratification may thus guide the way to personalized medicine.\\n\\nSignificance statementResearch provides substantial evidence that late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD) is a metabolic disease. Besides age, female sex and APOE{varepsilon}4 genotype represent strong risk factors for AD, and at the same time give rise to large metabolic differences. Our systematic investigation of sex and APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype differences in the link between metabolism and measures of pre-symptomatic AD using stratified analysis revealed several group-specific metabolic alterations that were not observed without sex and genotype stratification of the same cohort. Pathways linked to the observed metabolic alterations suggest females are more affected by impairment of mitochondrial energy production in AD than males, highlighting the importance of tailored treatment approaches towards a precision medicine approach.",

    "abstract": "There is extensive modification of the functional organization of the brain in the congenital blind human, although there is little understanding of the structural underpinnings of these changes. The visual system of macaque has been extensively characterized both anatomically and functionally. We have taken advantage of this to examine the influence of the congenital blindness in macaque resulting from the removal of the retina during in utero development. Developmental anophthalmia in macaque effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Here we show that retrograde tracers injected in early visual areas including hybrid cortex reveals a drastic reduction of cortical projections of the reduced lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, there is an important expansion of projections from the pulvinar complex to the hybrid cortex, compared to the controls. These findings show that the functional consequences of congenital blindness need to be considered in terms of both modifications of the inter-areal cortical network and the ascending visual pathways.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe objective was to determine if choice of anaesthetic confounded previous conclusions about the differences in nerve excitability indices between fast and slow motor axons.\\n\\nMethodologyNerve excitability of the rat sciatic nerve was tested while measuring responses of motor axons innervating the slow-twitch soleus (SOL) and fast-twitch tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. The experiments were conducted with sodium pentobarbital (SP) anaesthetic and compared to previous results that used ketamine-xylazine (KX).\\n\\nResults and ConclusionsPrevious conclusions about the differences in nerve excitability indices between TA and SOL motor axons using KX were corroborated and extended when experiments were done with SP. Nerve excitability indices sensitive to changes in hyperpolarization-activated inwardly rectifying cation current (Ih) indicated an increase in Ih in SOL axons compared to TA axons (e.g. S3 (-100 %), t=7.949 (df=10), p < 0.0001; TEh (90-100 ms), t=2.659 (df=20), p = 0.0145; hyperpolarizing I/V slope, t=4.308 (df=19), p = 0.0004). SOL axons also had a longer strength-duration time constant (t=3.35 (df=20), p = 0.0032) and a longer and larger magnitude relative refractory period (RRP (ms) t=3.53 (df=12), p = 0.0041; Refractoriness at 2 ms t=0.0055 (df=9), p = 0.0055).\\n\\nAnaesthetic choice affected many measures of peripheral nerve excitability with differences most apparent in tests of threshold electrotonus and recovery cycle. For example, recovery cycle with KX lacked a clear superexcitable and late subexcitable period. We conclude that KX had a confounding effect on nerve excitability results consistent with ischaemic depolarization. Results using SP revealed the full extent of differences in nerve excitability measures between putative slow and fast motor axons of the rat. These differences have important implications for the use of nerve excitability measures during processes such as ageing where it is believed that there is a selective loss of fast axons.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyNerve excitability testing is a tool used to provide insight into the properties of ion channels in peripheral nerves. It is used clinically to assess pathophysiology of motor axons. Researchers customarily think of motor axons as homogeneous; however, we demonstrate there are clear differences between fast and slow axons in the rat. This is important for interpreting results with selective motor neuronopathy, like aging where fast axons are at high risk of degeneration.",

We introduce an optimal mass transport (OMT) formulation that naturally handles intervoxel CA movement and distinguishes between advective and diffusive flows. Ten patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were enrolled in the study between June 2014 and October 2015 and under-went DCE MRI imaging prior to beginning treatment. The CA tissue concentration information was taken as the input in the data-driven OMT model. The OMT approach was tested on HNSCC DCE data that provides quantitative information for forward flux ({Phi}F) and backward flux ({Phi}B). OMT-derived {Phi}F was compared with the volume transfer constant for CA, Ktrans, derived from the Extended Tofts Model (ETM). The OMT-derived flows showed a consistent jump in the CA diffusive behavior across the images in accordance with the known CA dynamics. The mean forward flux was 0.0082 {+/-} 0.0091 (min-1) whereas the mean advective component was 0.0052{+/-}0.0086 (min-1) in the HNSCC patients. The diffusive percentages in forward and backward flux ranged from 8.67-18.76% and 12.76-30.36%, respectively. The OMT model accounts for intervoxel CA movement and results show that the forward flux ({Phi}F) is comparable with the ETM-derived Ktrans. This is a novel data-driven study based on optimal mass transport principles applied to patient DCE imaging to analyze CA flow in HNSCC.",

    "abstract": "Shark and ray biodiversity is threatened primarily by overfishing and the globalisation of trade, and Europe has been one of the most documented heavily fished regions for a relatively long time. Yet, we have little idea of the conservation status of the hundreds of Data Deficient shark and ray species. It is important to derive some insight into the status of these species, both to understand global extinction rates and also to ensure that any threatened Data Deficient species are not overlooked in conservation planning. Here, we developed a biological and ecological trait model to predict the categorical conservation status of 26 Northeast Atlantic and 15 Mediterranean Sea Data Deficient sharks and rays. We first developed an explanatory model based on all species evaluated on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM, using maximum body size, median depth (as a proxy for fisheries exposure), and reproductive mode, and then predicted the status of all Data Deficient species. Almost half of Northeast Atlantic (46%, n=12 of 26), and two-thirds of Mediterranean (67%, n=10 of 15) Data Deficient species are predicted to be in one of the three IUCN threatened categories. Northeast Atlantic Data Deficient species are predicted to be 1.2 times more threatened than evaluated species (38%, n=36 of 94), whereas threat levels in the Mediterranean Sea are relative for each (66%, n=38 of 58). This case study is intended for extrapolation to the global shark and ray dataset upon completion of the global IUCN Red List assessment. Trait-based, categorical prediction of conservation status is a cost-effective approach towards incorporating Data Deficient species into (i) estimates of lineage-wide extinction rates, (ii) revised protected species lists, and (iii) Red List Indices, thus preventing poorly known species from reaching extinction unnoticed.",

For example, while it is accepted that simpler designs, such as After (sampling sites post-impact without a control), Before-After (BA) and Control-Impact (CI), are less robust than Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) and Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) designs, it is not known how much less accurate they are.\\nC_LIO_LIWe simulate a step-change response of a population to an environmental impact using empirically-derived estimates of the major parameters. We use five ecological study designs to estimate the effect of this impact and evaluate each one by determining the percentage of simulations in which they accurately estimate the direction and magnitude of the environmental impact. We also simulate different numbers of replicates and assess several accuracy thresholds.\\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that BACI designs could be 1.1-1.5 times more accurate than RCTs, 2.9-4.1 times more accurate than BA, 3.8-5.6 times more accurate than CI, and 6.8-10.8 times more accurate than After designs, when estimating to within {+/-}30% of the true effect (depending on the sample size). We also found that increasing sample size substantially increases the accuracy of BACI designs but only increases the precision of simpler designs around a biased estimate; only by using more robust designs can accuracy increase. Modestly increasing replication of both control and impact sites also increased the accuracy of BACI designs more than substantially increasing replicates in just one of these groups.\\nC_LIO_LIWe argue that investment into using more robust designs in ecology, where possible, is extremely worthwhile given the inaccuracy of simpler designs, even when using large sample sizes. Based on our results we propose a weighting system that quantitatively ranks the accuracy of studies based on their study design and the number of replicates used. We hope these  accuracy weights enable researchers to better account for study design in evidence synthesis when assessing the reliability of a range of studies using a variety of designs.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "1The sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY) is thought to be the central genetic element of male sex development. Mutations within the SRY gene are associated with a male-to-female sex reversal syndrome in humans and other mammalian species such as mice and rabbits. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. To understand the biological function of the SRY gene, a site-directed mutational analysis is required to investigate associated phenotypic changes at the molecular, cellular and morphological level. In our study, we successfully generated a knockout of the porcine SRY gene by microinjection of two clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) - associated protein - 9 nuclease (Cas9) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes targeting the centrally located \"high mobility group\" (HMG) domain of the SRY gene. Mutations within this region resulted in the development of complete external and internal female genitalia in genetically male pigs. The internal female genitalia including uteri, ovaries, and oviducts, revealed substantial size differences in 9-months old SRY-knockout pigs compared to age-matched female wild type controls. In contrast, a deletion within the 5 flanking region of the HMG domain was not associated with sex reversal. Results of this study demonstrates for the first time the central role of the HMG domain of the SRY gene in male sex determination in pigs. Moreover, quantitative analysis by digital PCR revealed evidence for a duplication of the porcine SRY locus. Our results pave the way towards the generation of boars exclusively producing phenotypically female offspring to avoid surgical castration without anesthesia in piglets. Moreover, the study establishes a large animal model that is much more similar to humans in regard of physiology and anatomy and pivotal for longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "Neutral genetic diversity across the genome is determined by the complex interplay of mutation, demographic history, and natural selection. While the direct action of natural selection is limited to functional loci across the genome, its impact can have effects on nearby neutral loci due to genetic linkage. These effects of selection at linked sites, referred to as genetic hitchhiking and background selection (BGS), are pervasive across natural populations. However, only recently has there been a focus on the joint consequences of demography and selection at linked sites, and empirical studies have sometimes come to apparently contradictory conclusions as to their combined effects. In order to understand the relationship between demography and selection at linked sites, we conducted an extensive forward simulation study of BGS under a range of demographic models. We found that the relative levels of diversity in BGS and neutral regions vary over time and that the initial dynamics after a population size change are often in the opposite direction of the long-term expected trajectory. Our detailed observations of the temporal dynamics of neutral diversity in the context of selection at linked sites in non-equilibrium populations provides new intuition about why patterns of diversity under BGS vary through time in natural populations and help reconcile previously contradictory observations. Most notably, our results highlight that classical models of BGS are poorly suited for predicting diversity in non-equilibrium populations.",

    "abstract": "The FO motor in FOF1 ATP synthase rotates its rotor driven by the proton motive force. While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, developing a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36{degrees}-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reaches ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments.",

    "abstract": "Concerns have been raised over the impacts of cannabis farms on the environment and water resources in particular, yet data on cultivation practices and water use patterns and have been limited. Estimates of water use for cannabis cultivation have previously relied on extrapolated values of plant water demand, which are unable to account for differences in cultivation practices, variation across the growing season, or the role of water storage in altering seasonal extraction patterns. The current study uses data reported by enrollees in Californias North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Water Board) Cannabis Program to model how variation in cultivation practices and the use of stored water affect the timing and amount of water extracted from the environment. We found that the supplemental use of stored water resulted in a seasonal pattern of water extraction (i.e. water withdrawals from the environment) that was distinct from water demand (i.e. water applied to plants). Although water input to storage in the off-season months (November through March) reduced water extraction in the growing season (April through October), farms generally did not have sufficient storage to completely forbear from surface water extraction during the growing season. Beginning in 2019, forbearance will be required during this period for those in the regulated cannabis industry. The two most important predictors of storage sufficiency (type of storage infrastructure and seasonality of water source) also had reliable effects on seasonal extraction patterns, further emphasizing the link between water storage and extraction profiles. These findings suggest that resource managers and policy makers should consider the ways in which cultivation practices drive water extraction patterns and how these practices may be influenced by participation in the regulated cannabis industry.",

    "abstract": "Graves disease (GD) is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis in children and adolescents, accounting for 15% of all thyroid diseases during childhood. Anti-thyroid drugs (ATD) are recommended as the first-line treatment in children and adolescents. However, the remission rate is lower in children than in adults, and the optimal treatment duration and favorite factors associated with remission remain unknown. We aimed to investigate long-term outcomes of pediatric GD patients receiving ATD. We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of 300 pediatric GD subjects, who were initially treated with ATD and followed up for more than one year, from 1985 to 2017 at MacKay Childrens Hospital. The 300 patients comprised 257 (85.7%) females and 43 (14.3%) males, median age at diagnosis was 11.6 (range 2.7-17.8) years, and median follow-up period was 4.7 (range 1.1-23.9) years. Overall, 122 patients achieved the criteria for discontinuing ATD treatment, seventy-nine (39.9%) patients achieved remission, with a median follow-up period of 5.3 (range 1.5-20.1) years. Patients in the remission group were more likely to be aged < 5 years (remission vs. relapse vs. ongoing ATD; 11.4 vs. 0 vs. 2.6%, P=0.02), less likely to have a family history of thyroid disease (24.1 vs. 42.1 vs. 52.6 %, P=0.001), and had lower TRAb levels (42.8 vs. 53.6 vs. 65.1 %, P=0.02).\\n\\nConclusionLong-term ATD remains an effective treatment option for GD in children and adolescents. Pediatric GD patients aged < 5 years, having no family history of thyroid disease and having lower TRAb levels were more likely to achieve remission.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEntertainment venues have been identified as an important location for HIV prevention due to the increasing number of young female entertainment and sex workers at these venues. The purpose of this report is to increase understanding of the childhood conditions, pathways to entertainment work and current practices of female entertainment workers (FEWs) in Cambodia.\\n\\nMethodsData used for this study were collected in April 2018 as part of the baseline survey of the Mobile Link, a randomized controlled trial to improve sexual and reproductive health of FEWs in Cambodia. We used a stratified random sampling method to recruit 600 FEWs for face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive analyses were performed.\\n\\nResultsMost participants came from childhood homes without electricity (82.0%) or running water (87.0%). Most women moved to the city in the last ten years (80.5%) for economic reasons (43.7%). About a third worked in the garment industry prior to the entertainment industry (36.7%). Participation in transactional sex in the past three months was reported by 36.0%. Women reported low condom use practices with non-paying partners (23.4% used condom with partner at last sex), excessive and forced alcohol use at work (33.1% reported being forced to drink alcohol at work more than once a month), low modern contraception use (31.4% was using modern contraception), and experiences of gender-based violence (23.3% reported verbal threats, physical abuse or forced sex in the past six months).\\n\\nConclusionsThis information will help to support the development of future individual and structural level interventions for the safety and support of FEWs. In addition, these results may contribute to an evidence base that can inform policy level changes intended to support the realization of full human rights for entertainment works in Cambodia including the rights to health, safety, and respectful employment.",

The aim of this study was to determine the association between hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) and risk of adiposity in the offspring at 10-11 years of age.\\n\\nMethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Colombo district, Sri Lanka. 7205 children who were born in 2005 were identified through schools and Public Health Midwives in the community. Mothers of these children still possessing antenatal records were interviewed and relevant data were extracted from medical records to identify eligible participants. Exposure status (hyperglycaemia in pregnancy) was ascertained based on client held antenatal records. 159 children of mothers with HIP (exposed) and 253 children of mothers with no HIP (non-exposed) were recruited. Height, weight, waist circumference and triceps skin fold thickness (TSFT) of participants were measured to ascertain outcome status.\\n\\nResultsThe mean ages (SD) of exposed and non-exposed groups were 10.9 (0.3) and 10.8 (0.3) years respectively. The median BMI (17.6 vs 16.1, p<0.001), waist circumference (63cm vs 59.3 cm, p<0.001) and triceps skinfold thickness (13.7mm vs 11.2mm, p< 0.001) were significantly higher in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group.\\n\\nChildren who were exposed to intrauterine hyperglycaemia were more likely to be overweight (aOR=2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.7), have abdominal obesity (aOR=2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.8) and high TSFT > 70th centile (aOR=2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.9) at 10-11 years of age than children who were not exposed after adjusting for maternal BMI, birth weight and birth order.\\n\\nConclusionsIntrauterine exposure to HIP is associated with significantly higher risk of adiposity in the offspring at 10 years of age.",

    "abstract": "There are numerous reports on PHB depolymerases produced by a wide variety of microorganisms isolated from various habitats, however, reports on PHB depolymerase isolated from plastic contaminated sites are scares. Thermophilic PHB polymerase produced by isolates obtained from plastic contaminated sites is expected to have better relevance for its application in plastic/ bioplastic degradation. Although PHB has attracted commercial significance, the inefficient production and recovery methods, inefficient purification of PHB depolymerase and lack of ample knowledge on PHB degradation by PHB depolymerase have hampered its large scale commercialization. Therefore, to ensure the biodegradability of biopolymers, it becomes imperative to study the purification of the biodegrading enzyme system. We report the production, purification, and characterization of extracellular PHB depolymerase from Stenotrophomonas sp. RZS 7 isolated from a plastic contaminated site. The isolate produced extracellular poly-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerase in the mineral salt medium at 30oC during 4 days of incubation under shake flask condition. Purification of the enzyme was carried out by three different methods using PHB as a substrate. Purification of PHB depolymerase by ammonium salt precipitation, column chromatography, and solvent purification method was successfully carried out. Among the purification method tested, the enzyme was best purified by column chromatography on Octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column with maximum (0.7993 U/mg/ml) purification yield. The molecular weight of purified PHB depolymerase (40 kDa) closely resembled with PHB depolymerase of Aureobacterium saperdae.",

    "abstract": "Leptospira genus contains species that affect human health with varying degrees of pathogenicity. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the differences in modulation of host gene expression by strains of Leptospira with varied virulence degrees. Our data showed a high number of differentilly expressed transcripts in murine macrophages following 6h of infection with both virulent and culture-attenuated L. interrogans and to a lesser degree, with the saprophyte strain L. biflexa. That suggests that certain genes are modulated by Leptospira infection independent of their degree of virulence, whether others are virulence and species associated. Pathway analysis indicated that Apoptosis, ATM Signaling and Cell Cycle: G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint Regulation were exclusively regulated following infection with the virulent strain. Results demonstrated that species and virulence play a role during host response to Leptosppira spp in murine macrophages.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLeptospirosis is an infectious disease that is transmitted from animals to humans. It is a re-emerging neglected zoonosis that is found in a range of environments worldwide, most notably tropical regions prone to flooding. This bacteria is found in soil and water and are eliminated in the urine by rats, their natural host reservoir. Through skin contacts with the bacteria people or animals can get infected however the infection process is still poorly understood, such as the fact that different strains can cause different severity of illness. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the differences in modulation of host gene expression by strains of Leptospira varying in virulence. After transcriptomic analysis, the results showed a high number of differentially expressed genes after 6h of infection by virulent and attenuated L. interrogans, and to a lesser extent with L. biflexa saprophytic lineage. This suggests that RNAs are modulated after infection by Leptospira in macrophages, in a species and virulence related manner. It is hoped that the data produced will contribute to further our understanding on the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.",

    "abstract": "Seed germination is considered as the beginning of the spermatophyte lifecycle, as it is a crucial stage in determining subsequent plant growth and development. Although many previous studies have found that melatonin can promote seed germination, the role of melatonin in cotton germination remains unexamined. The main objective of this study is the characterization of potential promotional effects of melatonin (at doses of 0, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 M) on cotton seed germination. This experiment demonstrated that low concentrations of melatonin can promote germination, while high concentrations failed to promote germination and even inhibited germination. Together, these results indicate that a 20 M melatonin treatment optimally promotes cotton seed germination. Compared with the control, germination potential (GP), germination rate (GR) and final fresh weight (FW) increased by 16.67%, 12.30% and 4.81% respectively. Although low concentrations of melatonin showed some improvement in vigor index (VI), germination index (GI) and mean germination time (MGT), these effects did not reach significant levels. Antioxidant enzyme activity during seed germination was most prominent under the 20 M melatonin treatment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities were significantly increased by 10.37-59.73% and 17.79-47.68% compared to the melatonin-free control. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was reduced by 16.73-40.33%. Two important plant hormones in seed germination were also studied. As melatonin concentration increased, ABA content in seeds decreased first and then increased, and GA3 content showed a diametrically opposite trend, in which the 20 M melatonin treatment was optimal. The 20 M melatonin treatment reduced ABA content in seeds by 42.13-51.68%, while the 20 M melatonin treatment increased GA3 content in seeds to about 1.7-2.5 times that of seeds germinated without melatonin. This study provides new evidence suggesting that low concentrations of melatonin can promote cotton seed germination by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing the accumulation of MDA and regulating plant hormones. This has clear applications for improving the germination rate of cotton seeds using melatonin.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining sustainable fisheries requires understanding the influence of technological advances on catch efficiency. Fisheries using light sources for attraction could be widely impacted by the shift to light emitting diode (LED) light systems. We studied the transition from kerosene lanterns to LED lamps in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, examining factors that led to adoption as well as the impact of the new light sources on fish catch and composition. We used a combination of field experiments with catch assessments, fisher surveys, underwater light spectra measurements, and cost assessments to evaluate the impact of switching from kerosene to LED lamps. Overall, we found a very rapid rate of adoption of homemade outdoor LED light systems in Lake Tanganyika. Most of the batteries used to power these lamps were charged from the city power grid, rather than photovoltaic cells. The LED light spectra was distinct from the kerosene light and penetrated much deeper into the water column. Regardless of light type, most of the fish caught within the two dominant species were below maturity, indicating that current fishery is not sustainable. Although the LED lamps were associated with a slight increase in catch, environmental factors, particularly distance offshore, were generally more important in determining fish catch size and composition. The main advantages of the LED lamps were the lower operating costs and their robustness in bad weather. Overall, the use of battery-powered LED lighting systems to attract fish in Lake Tanganyika appears to reduce economic costs but not contribute new impacts on the fishery.",

    "abstract": "There have been many reports about the adverse effects of nanoparticles (NPs) on the environment and human health. Conventional toxicity assessments of NPs frequently assume uniform distribution of monodisperse NPs in homogeneous cell populations, and provide information on the relationships between the administered dose of NPs and cellular responses averaged for a large number of cells. They may have limitations in describing the wide heterogeneity of cell-NP interactions, caused by cell-to-cell and NP-to-NP variances. To achieve more detailed insight into the heterogeneity of cell-NP interactions, it is essential to understand the cellular association and adverse effects of NPs at single-cell level. In this study, we applied mass cytometry to investigate the interactions between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and primary human immune cells. High dimensionality of mass cytometry allowed us to identify various immune cell types and observe the cellular association and toxicity of AgNPs in each population. Our findings showed that AgNPs had higher affinity with phagocytic cells like monocytes and dendritic cells and caused more severe toxic effects than with T cells, B cells and NK cells. Multi-element detection capability of mass cytometry also enabled us to simultaneously monitor cellular AgNP dose and intracellular signaling of individual cells, and subsequently investigate the dose-response relationships of each immune population at single-cell level, which are often hidden in conventional toxicity assays at bulk-cell level. Our study will assist future development of single-cell dose-response models for various NPs and will provide key information for the safe use of nanomaterials for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in the past few years on the computational identification biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). This is done by identifying both RiPP tailoring enzymes (RTEs) and RiPP precursor peptides (PPs). However, identification of PPs, particularly for novel RiPP classes remains challenging. To address this, machine learning has been used to accurately identify PP sequences. However, current machine learning tools have limitations, since they are specific to the RiPP-class they are trained for, and are context-dependent, requiring information about the surrounding genetic environment of the putative PP sequences. NeuRiPP overcomes these limitations. It does this by leveraging the rich data set of high-confidence putative PP sequences from existing programs, along with experimentally verified PPs from RiPP databases. NeuRiPP uses neural network models that are suitable for peptide classification with weights trained on PP datasets. It is able to identify known PP sequences, and sequences that are likely PPs. When tested on existing RiPP BGC datasets, NeuRiPP is able to identify PP sequences in significantly more putative RiPP clusters than current tools, while maintaining the same HMM hit accuracy. Finally, NeuRiPP was able to successfully identify PP sequences from novel RiPP classes that are recently characterized experimentally, highlighting its utility in complementing existing bioinformatics tools.",

    "abstract": "Gephebase is a manually-curated database compiling our accumulated knowledge of the genes and mutations that underlie natural, domesticated and experimental phenotypic variation in all Eukaryotes -- mostly animals, plants and yeasts. Gephebase aims to compile studies where the genotype-phenotype association (based on linkage mapping, association mapping or a candidate gene approach) is relatively well supported or understood. Human disease and aberrant mutant phenotypes in laboratory model organisms are not included in Gephebase and can be found in other databases (eg. OMIM, OMIA, Monarch Initiative). Gephebase contains more than 1700 entries. Each entry corresponds to an allelic difference at a given gene and its associated phenotypic change(s) between two species or between two individuals of the same species, and is enriched with molecular details, taxonomic information, and bibliographic information. Users can easily browse entries for their topic of interest and perform searches at various levels, whether phenotypic, genetic, taxonomic or bibliographic (eg. transposable elements, cis-regulatory mutations, snakes, carotenoid content, an author name). Data can be searched using keywords and boolean operators and is exportable in spreadsheet format. This database allows to perform meta-analysis to extract general information and global trends about evolution, genetics, and the field of evolutionary genetics itself. Gephebase should also help breeders, conservationists and others to identify the most promising target genes for traits of interest, with potential applications such as crop improvement, parasite and pest control, bioconservation, and genetic diagnostic. It is freely available at www.gephebase.org.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is pathologically reactivated in most human cancers, where it maintains chromosomal telomeres and allows immortalization. Because telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is usually the limiting component for telomerase activation, numerous studies have measured TERT mRNA levels in populations of cells or in tissues. However, little is known about TERT expression at the single-cell and single-molecule level. Here we analyzed TERT expression across 10 human cancer lines using single-molecule RNA FISH and made several unexpected findings. First, there was substantial cell-to-cell variation in number of transcription sites and ratio of transcription sites to gene copies. Second, previous classification of lines as having monoallelic or biallelic TERT expression was found to be inadequate for capturing the TERT gene expression patterns. Finally, TERT mRNA had primarily nuclear localization in cancer cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in stark contrast to the expectation that mature mRNA should be predominantly cytoplasmic. These data reveal unappreciated heterogeneity, complexity, and unconventionality in TERT expression across human cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Herbivorous insects have evolved many mechanisms to overcome plant chemical defenses, including detoxification and sequestration. Herbivores may also use toxic plants to reduce parasite infection. Plant toxins could directly interfere with parasites or could enhance endogenous immunity. Alternatively, plant toxins could favor down-regulation of endogenous immunity by providing an alternative (exogenous) defense against parasitism. However, studies on genome-wide transcriptomic responses to plant defenses and the interplay between host plant toxicity and parasite infection remain rare. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are specialist herbivores that feed on milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), which contain toxic cardenolides. Monarchs have adapted to cardenolides through multiple resistance mechanisms and can sequester cardenolides to defend against bird predators. In addition, high-cardenolide milkweeds confer medicinal effects to monarchs against a specialist protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha). We used this system to study the interplay between the effects of plant toxicity and parasite infection on global gene expression. Our results demonstrate that monarch larvae differentially express several hundred genes when feeding on A. curassavica and A. incarnata, two species that are similar in nutritional content but differ substantially in cardenolide concentrations. These differentially expressed genes include genes within multiple families of canonical insect detoxification genes, suggesting that they play a role in monarch toxin resistance and sequestration. Interestingly, we found little transcriptional response to infection. However, parasite growth was reduced in monarchs reared on A. curassavica, and in these monarchs, a small number of immune genes were down-regulated, consistent with the hypothesis that medicinal plants can reduce reliance on endogenous immunity.",

    "abstract": "Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is a major cause of mortality in patients who have suffered from severe ischemic stroke. Although multi-factorial in nature, stroke-induced immunosuppression plays a key role in the development of SAP. Previous studies of focal ischemic stroke induction, using a murine model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) have shown that severe brain damage results in massive apoptosis and functional defects of lymphocytes in the spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood. However, how immune alternations in remote tissues lead to a greater susceptibility to lung infections is not well-understood. Importantly, how ischemic stroke alters immune-cell fates, and the expression of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs that directly impact pulmonary immunity, has not been characterized. We report here that ischemic stroke increases the percentage of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs), but reduces the percentage of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and eosinophils in the lungs. The depletion of immune cells in the lungs is not caused by apoptosis, cell infiltration to the brain, or spontaneous pneumonia following ischemic stroke as previously described, but correlates with a significant reduction in the levels of multiple chemokines in the lungs, including: CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CXCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10. These findings suggest that ischemic stroke negatively impacts pulmonary immunity to become more susceptible for SAP development. Further investigation into the mechanisms that control pulmonary immune alternations following ischemic stroke may identify novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets for SAP.",

It has been suggested that the 2-photon depth limit, beyond which results become inaccurate, is where in- and out-of-focus fluorescence are equal. We found the depth limit of 2-photon excitation in mice with GCaMP6 indicator expression in all layers of visual cortex, by comparing near-simultaneous 2- and 3-photon excitation. 2-photon results were accurate only superficial to 450 m, matching the depth at which in-and out-of-focus fluorescence were equal. The expected depth limit is deeper in tissue with fewer fluorophores outside the plane of interest. Our results, from tissue with a largely homogenous distribution of fluorophores, establish a superficial bound on the 2-photon depth limit in the mouse visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "English Wikipedia, containing more than five millions articles, has approximately eleven thousands web pages devoted to proteins or genes most of which were generated by the Gene Wiki project. These pages contain information about interactions between proteins and their functional relationships. At the same time, they are interconnected with other Wikipedia pages describing biological functions, diseases, drugs and other topics curated by independent, not coordinated collective efforts. Therefore, Wikipedia contains a directed network of protein functional relations or physical interactions embedded into the global network of the encyclopedia terms, which defines hidden (indirect) functional proximity between proteins. We applied the recently developed reduced Google Matrix (REGOMAX) algorithm in order to extract the network of hidden functional connections between proteins in Wikipedia. In this network we discovered tight communities which reflect areas of interest in molecular biology or medicine. Moreover, by comparing two snapshots of Wikipedia graph (from years 2013 and 2017), we studied the evolution of the network of direct and hidden protein connections. We concluded that the hidden connections are more dynamic compared to the direct ones and that the size of the hidden interaction communities grows with time. We recapitulate the results of Wikipedia protein community analysis and annotation in the form of an interactive online map, which can serve as a portal to the Gene Wiki project.",

This analysis identifies Let-7g, Let-7a, miR-200a, and miR-375 as endocrine-enriched miRNAs with high impact on driving endocrine differentiation-associated gene expression changes. These miRNAs target different sets of transcription factors, which converge on a network of genes involved in cell cycle regulation. When expressed in human embryonic stem cell-derived pancreatic progenitors these miRNAs induce cell cycle exit and promote endocrine cell differentiation.

We demonstrate that in infected hepatocytes, lysosomes are redistributed away from the nucleus, and surface exposure of lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP1) is increased. Lysosome exocytosis in infected cells occurs independently of sporozoite traversal. Instead, a sporozoite-secreted factor is sufficient for the process. Knockdown of the SNARE proteins involved in lysosome-plasma membrane fusion reduces lysosome exocytosis and Plasmodium infection. In contrast, promoting fusion between the lysosome and plasma membrane dramatically increases infection. Our work demonstrates new parallels between Plasmodium sporozoite entry of hepatocytes and infection by the excavate pathogen, Trypanosoma cruzi and raises the question of whether convergent evolution has shaped host cell invasion by divergent pathogens.",

Spike-threshold adaptation enables such a discrimination but is ineffective in transmitting this information to the network. We show here that presynaptic axonal sodium channels read and transmit precise levels of input synchrony to the postsynaptic cell by modulating the presynaptic action potential (AP) amplitude. As a consequence, synaptic transmission is facilitated at cortical synapses when the presynaptic spike is produced by synchronous inputs. Using dual soma-axon recordings, imaging, and modeling, we show that this facilitation results from enhanced AP amplitude in the axon due to minimized inactivation of axonal sodium-channels. Quantifying local circuit activity and using network modeling, we found that spikes induced by synchronous inputs produced a larger effect on network activity than spikes induced by asynchronous inputs. Therefore, this input-synchrony dependent facilitation (ISF) may constitute a powerful mechanism regulating spike transmission.",

    "abstract": "Glutamine Synthetase1 (GS1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of L-glutamine from L-glutamate and ammonia as a key element of the glutamate glutamine cycle, a complex physiological process occurring between glia and neurons, necessary to control the homeostasis of glutamate. Using a Drosophila model for Huntingtons disease, we report that expression of GS1 in neurons ameliorates the motility defects of animals expressing the mutant Httex1-Q93 form of the huntingtin gene. At the cellular level, expression of GS1 increases the basal level of autophagy and significantly reduces the size of the toxic Htt-Q93 protein aggregates. In addition, we found that expression of GS1 prevents TOR localization at the lysosomal membrane and reduction in the phosphorylation of its effector S6K. This study reveals a novel function for GS1 in neurons linking its activity to the inhibition of TOR signaling and autophagy. The identification of novel pharmacological regulators of autophagy is of particular interest considering its beneficial role in controlling neuronal health and counteracting the detrimental effects of toxic aggregates of proteinopathies including Huntingtons disease.",

    "abstract": "Membrane-protein design is an exciting and increasingly successful research area which has led to landmarks including the design of stable and accurate membrane-integral proteins based on coiled-coil motifs. Design of topologically more complex proteins, such as most receptors, channels, and transporters, however, demands an energy function that balances contributions from intra-protein contacts and protein-membrane interactions. Recent advances in water-soluble all-atom energy functions have increased the accuracy in structure-prediction benchmarks. The plasma membrane, however, imposes different physical constraints on protein solvation. To understand these constraints, we recently developed a high-throughput experimental screen, called dsT{beta}L, and inferred apparent insertion energies for each amino acid at dozens of positions across the bacterial plasma membrane. Here, we express these profiles as lipophilicity energy terms in Rosetta and demonstrate that the new energy function outperforms previous ones in modelling and design benchmarks. Rosetta ab initio simulations starting from an extended chain recapitulate two-thirds of the experimentally determined structures of membrane-spanning homo-oligomers with <2.5 [A] root-mean-square deviation within the top-predicted five models. Furthermore, in two sequence-design benchmarks, the energy function improves discrimination of stabilizing point mutations and recapitulates natural membrane-protein sequences of known structure, thereby recommending this new energy function for membrane-protein modelling and design.",

    "abstract": "We have discovered that basement membrane and its major components can induce rapid, strikingly robust fibronectin organization. In this new matrix assembly mechanism, 5{beta}1 integrin-based focal adhesions slide actively on the underlying matrix towards the ventral cell center through the dynamic shortening of myosin IIA-associated actin stress fibers to drive rapid fibronectin fibrillogenesis distal to the adhesion. This mechanism contrasts with classical fibronectin assembly based on stable/fixed-position focal adhesions containing V{beta}3 integrins plus 5{beta}1 integrin translocation into proximal fibrillar adhesions. On basement membrane components, these sliding focal adhesions contain standard focal adhesion constituents but completely lack classical V{beta}3 integrins. Instead, peripheral 3{beta}1 or 2{beta}1 adhesions mediate initial cell attachment, but over time are switched to 5{beta}1 integrin-based sliding focal adhesions to assemble fibronectin matrix. This basement membrane-triggered mechanism produces rapid fibronectin fibrillogenesis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the well-known widespread accumulation of fibronectin at many organ basement membranes.",

    "abstract": "The timing of plant developmental transitions is decisive for reproductive success and thus tightly regulated. The transition from juvenile to adult vegetative and later to the reproductive phase is controlled by an endogenous pathway regulated by miR156, targeting the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN (SBP/SPL) family of transcription factors. SPLs regulate a number of developmental processes, such as trichome formation, leaf shape and floral transition. Such complex regulatory pathways often involve post-translational modifications (PTMs), integrating a range of internal and external signals. One of these PTMs is O-glycosylation, the attachment of a single monosaccharide to serine or threonine of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, which is found on a number of very diverse proteins. O-GlcNAcylation is the most common type of cytosolic O-glycosylation, but in plants also O-fucose modification occurs. Here we show that mutants defective in the O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY (SPY) show accelerated developmental transitions. Genetic analysis shows that this effect is independent of miR156 levels, but partly dependent on functional SPLs. In a phenotyping analysis, we found that SPY and SPLs also control leaf growth, as loss of function mutants showed defects in cell expansion, while SPL9 also regulates cell division in rosette leaves. Moreover, SPLs interact directly with SPY and are O-glycosylated. Our results show that O-glycosylation is involved at several steps in the regulation of developmental transitions and organ growth in Arabidopsis thaliana.",

They play important roles in cell migration, neural development, metabolism and cancer cell survival. The knockout phenotypes of individual IMP proteins suggest that each family member regulates a unique pool of RNAs, yet evidence and an underlying mechanism for this is lacking. Here, we combine SELEX and NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that the major RNA binding domains of the two most distantly related IMPs (ZBP1 and IMP2) bind to different consensus sequences and regulate targets consistent with their knockout phenotypes and roles in disease. We find that the targeting specificity of each IMP is determined by few amino acids in their variable loops. As variable loops often differ amongst KH domain paralogs, we hypothesize that this is a general mechanism for evolving specificity and regulation of the transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens express a set of proteins required for establishing and maintaining an infection, termed virulence life-style genes (VLGs). Due to their outsized importance in pathogenesis, VLG products are attractive targets for the next generation of antimicrobials. However, precise manipulation of VLG expression in the context of infection is technically challenging, limiting our ability to understand the roles of VLGs in pathogenesis and accordingly design effective inhibitors. We previously developed a suite of gene knockdown tools that are transferred by conjugation and stably integrate into pathogen genomes that we call \\\"Mobile-CRISPRi\\\". Here we show the efficacy of Mobile-CRISPRi in controlling VLG expression in a murine infection model. We optimize Mobile-CRISPRi in Pseudomonas aeruginosa for use in a murine model of pneumonia by tuning the expression of CRISPRi components to avoid non-specific toxicity. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that knockdown of a VLG encoding the type III secretion system (T3SS) activator ExsA blocks effector protein secretion in culture and attenuates virulence in mice. We anticipate that Mobile-CRISPRi will be a valuable tool to probe the function of VLGs across many bacterial species and pathogenesis models.\\n\\nImportanceAntibiotic resistance is a growing threat to global health. To optimize the use of our existing antibiotics and identify new targets for future inhibitors, understanding the fundamental drivers of bacterial growth in the context of the host immune response is paramount. Historically these genetic drivers have been difficult to manipulate, as they are requisite for pathogen survival. Here, we provide the first application of Mobile-CRISPRi to study virulence life-style genes in mouse models of lung infection through partial gene perturbation. We envision the use of Mobile-CRISPRi in future pathogenesis models and antibiotic target discovery efforts.",

It is composed of several chromatin modifying complexes, including Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which deposits H3K27me2/3. Here, we report the identification of a new cofactor of PRC2, EZHIP (EZH1/2 Inhibitory Protein), expressed predominantly in the gonads. EZHIP limits the enzymatic activity of PRC2 and lessens the interaction between the core complex and its accessory subunits, but does not interfere with PRC2 recruitment to chromatin. Deletion of Ezhip leads to a global increase in H3K27me2/3 deposition both during spermatogenesis and at late stages of oocyte maturation. This alteration of the epigenetic content of mature oocytes does not affect the initial number of follicles but is associated with a reduction of follicles in aging mice. We provide evidences that mature oocytes Ezhip -/- are not fully functional and that fertility is strongly impaired in Ezhip -/- females. Altogether, our study uncovers EZHIP as a novel functional player in the comprehensive chromatin remodeling that occurs in the gonads.",

    "abstract": "Cell movement is crucial for morphogenesis in multicellular organisms. Growing embryos or tissues often expand isotropically, i.e., uniformly, in all dimensions. On the surfaces of these expanding environments, which we call \\\"fields,\\\" cells are subjected to frictional forces and move passively in response. However, the potential roles of isotropically expanding fields in morphogenetic events have not been investigated well. In this study, we mathematically analyzed the effect of isotropically expanding fields using a vertex model, a standard type of multi-cellular model. We found that cells located on fields were elongated along a similar direction each other. Simultaneously, the cell clusters were also elongated, even though field expansion was absolutely isotropic. We then investigated the mechanism underlying these counterintuitive phenomena. In particular, we asked whether elongation was caused by the properties of the field, the cell cluster, or both. Theoretical analyses involving simplification of the model revealed that cell clusters have an intrinsic ability to asymmetrically deform, leading to their elongation. Importantly, this ability is effective only under the non-equilibrium conditions provided by field expansion. This may explain the elongation of the notochord, located on the surface of the growing mouse embryo. We established that passive cell movement induced by isotropically expanding external environments can contribute to both cell and tissue elongation, as well as collective cell alignment, providing key insight into morphogenesis involving multiple adjacent tissues.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceIt is a central question of developmental biology how the symmetric shapes of eggs can develop the asymmetric structures of embryos. Embryos expand through their growth. Simultaneously, elongation of tissues such as the notochord occurs, which is fundamental phenomena of morphogenesis. However, possible relationships between tissue elongation and the expansion of embryos have not been investigated well. Here we mathematically present that, even if the expansion is isotropic, tissues located on the embryos are asymmetrically deformed by the expansion, resulting in elongation. We generalize the effect of expanding environments on tissue elongation through model reduction and uncover the mechanism underlying elongation. This process can be a novel key piece for symmetry breaking of embryos, together with previously established morphogenetic processes.",

To identify pathways that regulate ASC quiescence and tissue homeostasis, we study melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) that drive vertebrate pigmentation. In larval zebrafish, MSCs are quiescent, but can be recruited to regenerate the larval pigment pattern following melanocyte ablation. Through pharmacological experiments, we found that inhibition of GABA-A receptor function, specifically the GABA-A rho subtype, induces excessive melanocyte production in larval zebrafish. Conversely, pharmacological activation of GABA-A inhibited melanocyte regeneration. We used CRISPR to generate two mutant alleles of gabrr1, a subtype of GABA-A. Both alleles exhibited robust melanocyte overproduction, while conditional overexpression of gabrr1 inhibited larval melanocyte regeneration. Our data suggest that gabrr1 signaling is necessary and sufficient to maintain MSC quiescence and prevent excessive pigmentation of the larval zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Cellular structures are continually subjected to forces, which may serve as mechanical signals for cells through their effects on biomolecule interaction kinetics. Typically, molecular complexes interact via \\\"slip bonds,\\\" so applied forces accelerate off rates by reducing transition energy barriers. However, biomolecules with multiple dissociation pathways may have considerably more complicated force dependencies. This is the case for DNA-binding proteins that undergo \\\"facilitated dissociation,\\\" in which competitor biomolecules from solution enhance molecular dissociation in a concentration-dependent manner. Using simulations and theory, we develop a generic model that shows that proteins undergoing facilitated dissociation can form an alternative type of molecular bond, known as a \\\"catch bond,\\\" for which applied forces suppress protein dissociation. This occurs because the binding by protein competitors responsible for the facilitated dissociation pathway can be inhibited by applied forces. Within the model, we explore how the force dependence of dissociation is regulated by intrinsic factors, including molecular sensitivity to force and binding geometry, and the extrinsic factor of competitor protein concentration. We find that catch bonds generically emerge when the force dependence of the facilitated unbinding pathway is stronger than that of the spontaneous unbinding pathway. The sharpness of the transition between slip- and catch-bond kinetics depends on the degree to which the protein bends its DNA substrate. These force-dependent kinetics are broadly regulated by the concentration of competitor biomolecules in solution. Thus, the observed catch bond is mechanistically distinct from other known physiological catch bonds because it requires an extrinsic factor - competitor proteins - rather than a specific intrinsic molecular structure. We hypothesize that this mechanism for regulating force-dependent protein dissociation may be used by cells to modulate protein exchange, regulate transcription, and facilitate diffusive search processes.\\n\\nStatement of significanceMechanotransduction regulates chromatin structure and gene transcription. Forces may be transduced via biomolecular interaction kinetics, particularly, how molecular complexes dissociate under stress. Typically, molecules form \\\"slip bonds\\\" that dissociate more rapidly under tension, but some form \\\"catch bonds\\\" that dissociate more slowly under tension due to their internal structure. We develop a model for a distinct type of catch bond that emerges via an extrinsic factor: protein concentration in solution. Underlying this extrinsic catch bond is \\\"facilitated dissociation,\\\" whereby competing proteins from solution accelerate protein-DNA unbinding by invading the DNA binding site. Forces may suppress invasion, inhibiting dissociation, as for catch bonds. Force-dependent facilitated dissociation can thus govern the kinetics of proteins sensitive to local DNA conformation and mechanical state.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens represent a powerful approach to study mechanisms of drug action and resistance. Cereblon modulating agents (CMs) have recently emerged as candidates for therapeutic intervention in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), a highly aggressive cancer caused by Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. CMs bind to cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor of the cullin-RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4CRBN, and thereby trigger the acquisition and proteasomal degradation of neosubstrates. Downstream mechanisms of CM toxicity are incompletely understood, however. To identify novel CM effectors and mechanisms of CM resistance, we performed positive selection CRISPR screens using three CMs with increasing toxicity in PEL: lenalidomide (LEN), pomalidomide (POM), and CC-122. Results identified several novel modulators of the activity of CRL4CRBN. The number of genes whose inactivation confers resistance decreases with increasing CM efficacy. Only inactivation of CRBN conferred complete resistance to CC-122. Inactivation of the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2G1 also conferred robust resistance against LEN and POM. Inactivation of additional genes, including the Nedd8-specific protease SENP8, conferred resistance to only LEN. SENP8 inactivation indirectly increased levels of unneddylated CUL4A/B, which limits CRL4CRBN activity in a dominant negative manner. Accordingly, sensitivity of SENP8-inactivated cells to LEN is restored by overexpression of CRBN. In sum, our screens identify several novel players in CRL4CRBN function and define pathways to CM resistance in PEL. These results provide rationale for increasing CM efficacy upon patient relapse from a less efficient CM. Identified genes could finally be developed as biomarkers to predict CM efficacy in PEL and other cancers.\\n\\nKey PointsO_LIGenome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens identify novel mediators of resistance to lenalidomide, pomalidomide and CC-122 in PEL cells.\\nC_LIO_LIUBE2G1 and SENP8 are modulators of CRL4CRBN and their inactivation drives resistance to CMs in PEL-derived cell lines.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The increasing throughput of DNA sequencing technologies creates a need for faster algorithms. The fate of most reads is to be mapped to a reference sequence, typically a genome. Modern mappers rely on heuristics to gain speed at a reasonable cost for accuracy. In the seeding heuristic, short matches between the reads and the genome are used to narrow the search to a set of candidate locations. Several seeding variants used in modern mappers show good empirical performance but they are difficult to calibrate or to optimize for lack of theoretical results. Here we develop a theory to estimate the probability that the correct location of a read is filtered out during seeding, resulting in mapping errors. We describe the properties of simple exact seeds, skip-seeds and MEM seeds (Maximal Exact Match seeds). The main innovation of this work is to use concepts from analytic combinatorics to represent reads as abstract sequences, and to specify their generative function to estimate the probabilities of interest. We provide several algorithms, which combined together give a workable solution for the problem of calibrating seeding heuristics for short reads. We also provide a C implementation of these algorithms in a library called Sesame. These results can improve current mapping algorithms and lay the foundation of a general strategy to tackle sequence alignment problems.

We have developed R6, a chemically-defined, albumin-free, low-transferrin culture medium, and MNC-RED, a protocol to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells into enucleated erythroid cells that does not require any albumin or any animal components. Erythropoiesis requires large amounts of iron for hemoglobin synthesis. In all existing protocols, these large iron needs are met by increasing the concentration of holo-transferrin. This is necessary because transferrin recycling does not take place in existing erythroid culture conditions. In the R6 medium, iron is provided to the differentiating erythroblasts by small amounts of recombinant transferrin supplemented with FeIII-EDTA, an iron chelator that allows transferrin recycling to take place in cell culture. As a result of the absence of albumin and the use of low amounts of transferrin, the production of cultured red blood cells using the MNC-RED protocol is much less expensive than with existing protocols. The MNC-RED protocol should therefore help make the many translational applications of cultured RBCs economically more feasible.\\n\\nHighlightsWe have developed R6, a chemically-defined, albumin-free low-transferrin culture medium, and MNC-RED, a protocol to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells into enucleated erythroid E\\n\\nR6 is suitable for red blood cell culture despite the low transferrin amounts because of the presence of FeIII-EDTA, an iron chelator that allows transferrin recycling to take place in cell culture.\\n\\nThe MNC-RED protocol should help make the many translational applications of cultured RBCs more economically feasible.",

    "abstract": "Autozygosity, meaning inheritance of an ancestral allele in the homozygous state is known to lead bi-allelic mutations that manifest their effects through the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Autosomal recessive mutations are known to be the underlying cause of several Mendelian metabolic diseases, especially among the offspring of related individuals. In line with this, inbreeding coefficient of an individual as a measure of cryptic autozygosity among the general population is known to lead adverse metabolic outcomes including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), a multifactorial metabolic disease for which the recessive genetic causes remain unknown. In order to unravel such effects for multiple metabolic facades of the disease, we investigated the relationship between the excess of homozygosity and the metabolic signature of T2DM. We included a set of heritable 143 circulating markers associated with fasting glucose in a Dutch genetic isolate Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) of up to 2,580 individuals. We calculated individual whole genome-based, exome-based and pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients and tested their influence on the T2DM-related metabolites as well as T2DM risk factors. We also performed model supervised genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) for the metabolites which significantly correlate with inbreeding values. Inbreeding value of the population significantly and positively correlated with associated with risk factors of T2DM: body-mass index (BMI), glucose, insulin resistance, fasting insulin and waist-hip ratio. We found that inbreeding influenced 32.9% of the T2DM-related metabolites, clustering among chemical groups of lipoproteins, amino-acids and phosphatidylcholines, whereas 80 % of these significant associations were independent of the BMI. The most remarkable effect of inbreeding is observed for S-HDL-ApoA1, for which we show evidence of the novel DISP1 genetic region discovered by model supervised GWAS, in the ERF population. In conclusion, we show that inbreeding effects human metabolism and genetic models other than the globally used additive model is worth considering for study of metabolic phenotypes.",

Here we focus on the relationship between CTCF binding and the decrease of the Nucleosome Repeat Length (NRL) for [~]20 adjacent nucleosomes, affecting up to 10% of the mouse genome. We found that the chromatin boundary near CTCF is created by the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) asymmetrically located >40 nucleotides 5-upstream from the centre of CTCF motif. The strength of CTCF binding to DNA is correlated with the decrease of NRL near CTCF and anti-correlated with the level of asymmetry of the nucleosome array. Individual chromatin remodellers have different contributions, with Snf2h having the strongest effect on the NRL decrease near CTCF and Chd4 playing a major role in the symmetry breaking. Upon differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts, a subset of common CTCF sites preserved in all three cell types maintains a relatively small local NRL despite genome-wide NRL increase. The sites which lost CTCF upon differentiation are characterised by nucleosome rearrangement 3-downstream, but the boundary defined by the NDR 5-upstream of CTCF motif remains.",

    "abstract": "Converging results suggest that perception is controlled by rhythmic processes in the brain. In the auditory domain, neuroimaging studies show that the perception of brief sounds is shaped by rhythmic activity prior to the stimulus and electrophysiological recordings have linked delta band (1-2 Hz) activity to the functioning of individual neurons. These results have promoted theories of rhythmic modes of listening and generally suggest that the perceptually relevant encoding of acoustic information is structured by rhythmic processes along auditory pathways. A prediction from this perspective - which so far has not been tested - is that such rhythmic processes also shape how acoustic information is combined over time to judge extended soundscapes. The present study was designed to directly test this prediction. Human participants judged the overall change in perceived frequency content in temporally extended (1.2 to 1.8 s) soundscapes, while the perceptual use of the available sensory evidence was quantified using psychophysical reverse correlation. Model-based analysis of individual participants perceptual weights revealed a rich temporal structure, including linear trends, a U-shaped profile tied to the overall stimulus duration, and importantly, rhythmic components at the time scale of 1 to 2Hz. The collective evidence found here across four versions of the experiment supports the notion that rhythmic processes operating on the delta band time scale structure how perception samples temporally extended acoustic scenes.",

The lack of experimental data characterizing enzyme activities and kinetics along with the associated uncertainties impede the development of kinetic models, and researchers commonly use Monte Carlo sampling to explore the parameter space. However, the sampling of parameter spaces is a computationally expensive task for larger biochemical networks. To address this issue, we exploit the fact that reaction rates of biochemical reactions and network responses can be expressed as a function of displacements from thermodynamic equilibrium of elementary reaction steps and concentrations of free enzymes and their intermediary complexes. For a set of kinetic mechanisms ubiquitously found in biochemistry, we express kinetic responses of enzymes to changes in network metabolite concentrations through these quantities both analytically and schematically. The tailor-made sampling of these quantities allows for characterizing the missing kinetic parameters and accelerating the efforts towards building genome-scale kinetic metabolic models.",

    "abstract": "Telomere attrition is a risk factor for end-stage liver disease. Due to a lack of adequate models and intrinsic difficulties in studying telomerase in physiologically relevant cells, the molecular mechanisms responsible for liver disease in patients with telomere syndromes remain elusive. To circumvent that, we used genome editing to generate isogenic human embryonic stem cell lines (hESCs) harboring a clinically relevant mutation in telomerase (DKC1_A353V) and subjected them to an in vitro, stage-specific hepatocyte differentiation protocol, that resembles hepatocyte development in vivo. Our results show that while telomerase is highly expressed in hESCs, it is quickly silenced, due to TERT down-regulation, after endoderm differentiation, and completely absent in in vitro derived hepatocytes, similarly to what is observed in primary hepatocytes. While endoderm derivation is not impacted by telomere shortening, progressive telomere dysfunction impaired hepatic endoderm formation. Consequently, hepatocyte-derivation, as measured by expression of specific markers, as well by albumin expression and secretion, is severely compromised in telomerase mutant cells with short telomeres. Interestingly, this phenotype was not caused by cell death induction or senescence. Rather, telomere shortening induces down regulation of the human hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), in a p53 dependent manner. Telomerase reactivation, as well as p53 silencing, rescued hepatocyte formation in telomerase mutants. Likewise, conditional expression of HNF4, even in cells that retained short telomeres, accrued DNA damage, and p53 stabilization, successfully restored hepatocyte formation from hESCS.\\n\\nConclusionsCombined, our data shows that telomere dysfunction acts a major regulator of HNF4 during hepatocyte development and function, pointing to a potential novel target for the clinical management of liver disease in telomere-syndrome patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrimate-specific Alus contribute to transcriptional novelties in conserved gene regulatory networks. Alu RNAs are present at elevated levels in stress conditions and consequently leads to transcript isoform specific functional role modulating the physiological outcome. One of the possible mechanisms could be Alu nucleated mRNA-miRNA interplay.\n\nResultUsing combination of bioinformatics and experiments, we report a transcript isoform of an orphan gene, CYP20A1 (CYP20A1_Alu-LT) through exaptation of 23 Alus in its 9kb 3UTR. CYP20A1_Alu-LT, confirmed by 3RACE, is an outlier in length and expressed in multiple cell lines. We demonstrate its presence in single nucleus RNA-seq of [~]16000 human cortical neurons (including rosehip neurons). Its expression is restricted to the higher primates. Most strikingly, miRanda predicts [~]4700 miRNA recognition elements (MREs; with threshold< -25kcal/mol) for [~]1000 miRNAs, which have majorly originated within the 3UTR-Alus post exaptation. We hypothesized that differential expression of this transcript could modulate mRNA-miRNA networks and tested it in primary human neurons where CYP20A1_Alu-LT is downregulated during heat shock response and upregulated upon HIV1-Tat treatment. CYP20A1_Alu-LT could possibly function as a miRNA sponge as it exhibits features of a sponge RNA such as cytosolic localization and [&ge;]10 MREs for 140 miRNAs. Small RNA-seq revealed expression of nine miRNAs that can potentially be sponged by CYP20A1_Alu-LT in neurons. Additionally, CYP20A1_Alu-LT expression was positively correlated (low in heat shock and high in Tat) with 380 differentially expressed genes that contain cognate MREs for these nine miRNAs. This set is enriched in genes involved in neuronal development and hemostasis pathways.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrate a potential role for CYP20A1_Alu-LT as miRNA sponge through preferential presence of MREs within Alus in a transcript isoform specific manner. This highlights a novel component of Alu-miRNA mediated transcriptional modulation leading to physiological homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Autozygosity, meaning inheritance of an ancestral allele in the homozygous state is known to lead bi-allelic mutations that manifest their effects through the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Autosomal recessive mutations are known to be the underlying cause of several Mendelian metabolic diseases, especially among the offspring of related individuals. In line with this, inbreeding coefficient of an individual as a measure of cryptic autozygosity among the general population is known to lead adverse metabolic outcomes including Type 2 diabetes (T2DM); a multifactorial metabolic disease for which the recessive genetic causes remain unknown. In order to unravel such effects for multiple metabolic facades of the disease, we investigated the relationship between the excess of homozygosity and the metabolic signature of T2DM. We included a set of 53 metabolic phenotypes, including 47 metabolites, T2DM and five T2DM risk factors, measured in a Dutch genetic isolate of 2,580 people. For 20 of these markers, we identified 29 regions of homozygous (ROHs) associated with the nominal significance of P-value < 1.0 x 10-3. By performing association according to the recessive genetic model within these selected regions, we identified and replicated two intronic variants: rs6759814 located in KCNH7 associated with valine and rs1573707 located in PTPRT associated with IDL-free cholesterol and IDL-phospholipids. Additionally, we identified a rare intronic SNV in TBR1 for which the homozygous individuals were enriched for obesity. Interestingly, all three genes are mainly neuronally expressed and pointed out the involvement of glutamergic synaptic transmission pathways in the regulation of metabolic pathways. Taken together our study underline the additional benefits of model supervised analysis, but also seconds the involvement of the central nervous system in T2DM and obesity pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive allelic variation at both gene and single nucleotide level (SNV) between individuals is commonly associated with complex traits in humans and animals. Allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis, using RNA-Seq, can provide a detailed annotation of allelic imbalance and infer the existence of cis-acting transcriptional regulation. However, variant detection in RNA-Seq data is compromised by biased mapping of reads to the reference DNA sequence. In this manuscript we describe an unbiased standardised computational pipeline for allele-specific expression analysis using RNA-Seq data, which we have adapted and developed using tools available under open licence. The analysis pipeline we present is designed to minimise reference bias while providing accurate profiling of allele-specific expression across tissues and cell types. Using this methodology, we were able to profile pervasive allelic imbalance across tissues and cell types, at both the gene and SNV level, in Texel x Scottish Blackface sheep, using the sheep gene expression atlas dataset. ASE profiles were pervasive in each sheep and across all tissue types investigated. However, ASE profiles shared across tissues were limited and instead they tended to be highly tissue-specific. These tissue-specific ASE profiles may underlie the expression of economically important traits and could be utilized as weighted SNVs, for example, to improve the accuracy of genomic selection in breeding programmes for sheep. An additional benefit of the pipeline is that it does not require parental genotypes and can therefore be applied to other RNA-Seq datasets for livestock, including those available on the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) data portal. This study is the first global characterisation of moderate to extreme ASE in tissues and cell types from sheep. We have applied a robust methodology for ASE profiling, to provide both a novel analysis of the multi-dimensional sheep gene expression atlas dataset, and a foundation for identifying the regulatory and expressed elements of the genome that are driving complex traits in livestock.",

    "abstract": "Obesity-associated inflammation and loss of muscle function play critical roles in the development of osteoarthritis (OA); thus, therapies that target muscle tissue may provide novel approaches to restoring metabolic and biomechanical dysfunction associated with obesity. Recent studies indicate that follistatin (FST), a protein which binds myostatin and activin, may have the potential to enhance muscle formation while neutralizing inflammation induced by these proteins. Here, we hypothesized that adeno-associated virus (AAV9) delivery of FST will enhance muscle formation and mitigate metabolic inflammation and knee OA caused by a high fat diet in mice. Obese mice receiving AAV-mediated FST delivery exhibited decreased inflammatory adipokines and cytokines systemically in the serum as well as locally in the joint synovial fluid. Regardless of diet, mice receiving FST gene therapy were protected from post-traumatic OA and bone remodeling induced by joint injury. While obesity disrupted the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in adipocytes, gene therapy for FST restored the key proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as PPAR{gamma} coactivator 1 and AKT protein kinase 1, leading to the browning of white adipose tissue. Taken together, these findings suggest that FST gene therapy may provide a multifactorial therapeutic approach for injury-induced OA and metabolic inflammation in obesity.",

    "abstract": "A new lytic bacteriophage Andromeda, specific to the economically important plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, was isolated and characterised. It belongs to the Podoviridae family, Autographivirinae subfamily and possesses a linear dsDNA genome of 40,008 bp with four localised nicks. Crucially, Andromedas genome has no less than 80 hypervariable sites (SNPs), which show genome wide distribution resulting in heterogenous populations of this phage reminiscent of those of RNA virus quasispecies. Andromeda has no nucleotide sequence homology to phage phiNFS, a member of phiKMVviruses, in which a similar phenomenon was discovered. We show that Andromeda and Andromeda-related phages form a group within the Autographivirinae, designated here as the \"ExophiKMVviruses\". The \"ExophiKMVviruses\" were revealed to share conservation of gene order with core phiKMVviruses despite their sequence-based relationship to SP6-related phages. Our findings suggest that genomic hypervariability might be a feature that occurs among various Autographivirinae groups.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal protein (RP) genes locate near the replication origin (oriC) in fast-growing bacteria, which is thought to have been selected as a translation optimization strategy. Relocation of S10-spc- locus (S10), which codes for most of the RP, to ectopic genomic positions shows that its relative distance to the oriC correlates to a reduction on its dosage, its expression, and bacterial growth rate. Deep-sequencing revealed that S10 relocation altered chromosomal replication dynamics and genome-wide transcription. Such changes increased as a function of oriC-S10 distance. Strikingly, in this work we observed that protein production capacity was independent of S10 position. Since RP constitute a large proportion of cell mass, lower S10 dosage could lead to changes in macromolecular crowding, impacting cell physiology. Accordingly, cytoplasm fluidity was higher in mutants where S10 is most distant from oriC. In hyperosmotic conditions, when crowding differences are minimized, the growth rate and replication dynamics were highly alleviated in these strains. Therefore, on top of its essential function in translation, RP genomic location contributes to sustain optimal macromolecular crowding. This is a novel mechanism coordinating DNA replication with bacterial growth.",
