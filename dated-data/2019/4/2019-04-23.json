Here we show that HTT is dispensable for early zebrafish development, contrasting published zebrafish morpholino experiment results. Homozygous HTT knockouts were embryonically viable and appeared developmentally normal through juvenile stages. Comparison of adult fish revealed significant reduction in body size and fitness in knockouts compared to hemizygotes and wildtype fish, indicating an important role for wildtype HTT in postnatal development. Our zebrafish model provides an opportunity to examine the function of wildtype HTT later in development.",

    "abstract": "O_LIEcologists use a wide range of study designs to estimate the impact of interventions or threats but there are no quantitative comparisons of their accuracy. For example, while it is accepted that simpler designs, such as After (sampling sites post-impact without a control), Before-After (BA) and Control-Impact (CI), are less robust than Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) and Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) designs, it is not known how much less accurate they are.\\nC_LIO_LIWe simulate a step-change response of a population to an environmental impact using empirically-derived estimates of the major parameters. We use five ecological study designs to estimate the effect of this impact and evaluate each one by determining the percentage of simulations in which they accurately estimate the direction and magnitude of the environmental impact. We also simulate different numbers of replicates and assess several accuracy thresholds.\\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that BACI designs could be 1.1-1.5 times more accurate than RCTs, 2.9-4.1 times more accurate than BA, 3.8-5.6 times more accurate than CI, and 6.8-10.8 times more accurate than After designs, when estimating to within {+/-}30% of the true effect (depending on the sample size). We also found that increasing sample size substantially increases the accuracy of BACI designs but only increases the precision of simpler designs around a biased estimate; only by using more robust designs can accuracy increase. Modestly increasing replication of both control and impact sites also increased the accuracy of BACI designs more than substantially increasing replicates in just one of these groups.\\nC_LIO_LIWe argue that investment into using more robust designs in ecology, where possible, is extremely worthwhile given the inaccuracy of simpler designs, even when using large sample sizes. Based on our results we propose a weighting system that quantitatively ranks the accuracy of studies based on their study design and the number of replicates used. We hope these  accuracy weights enable researchers to better account for study design in evidence synthesis when assessing the reliability of a range of studies using a variety of designs.\\nC_LI",

Barcode sequences can be generated in the field using portable systems based on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION platform. However, to achieve a broader application, current proof-of-principle workflows for on-site barcoding analysis must be standardized to ensure reliable and robust performance under suboptimal field conditions without increasing costs. Here we demonstrate the implementation of a new on-site workflow for DNA extraction, PCR-based barcoding and the generation of consensus sequences. The portable laboratory features inexpensive instruments that can be carried as hand luggage and uses standard molecular biology protocols and reagents that tolerate adverse environmental conditions. Barcodes are sequenced using MinION technology and analyzed with ONTrack, an original de novo assembly pipeline that requires as few as 500 reads per sample. ONTrack-derived consensus barcodes have high accuracy, ranging from 99,8% to 100%, despite the presence of homopolymer runs. The ONTrack pipeline has a user-friendly interface and returns consensus sequences in minutes. The remarkable accuracy and low computational demand of the ONTrack pipeline, together with the inexpensive equipment and simple protocols, make the proposed workflow particularly suitable for tracking species under field conditions.",

    "abstract": "Internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression are the most common psychiatric disorders, frequently begin in youth, and exhibit marked heterogeneity in treatment response and clinical course. It is increasingly recognized that symptom-based classification approaches to internalizing disorders do not align with underlying neurobiology. An alternative to classifying psychopathology based on clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed subtypes based on brain imaging data. We used a recently developed semi-supervised machine learning method (HYDRA) to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity within youth with internalizing symptoms using structural imaging data collected at 3T from a large community-based sample of 1,141 youth. Using volume and cortical thickness, cross-validation methods indicated a highly stable solution (ARI=.66; permutation-based pfdr < .001) and identified two subtypes of internalizing youth. Subtype 1, defined by smaller brain volumes and reduced cortical thickness, was marked by impaired cognitive performance and higher levels of psychopathology than both Subtype 2 and typically developing youth. Using resting-state fMRI and diffusion images not considered during clustering, we found that Subtype 1 also showed reduced amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations in fronto-limbic regions at rest, as well as reduced fractional anisotropy in white matter tracts such as the parahippocampal cingulum bundle and the uncinate fasciculus. In contrast, Subtype 2 showed intact cognitive performance, greater volume, cortical thickness, and amplitudes during rest compared to Subtype 1 and typically developing youth, despite still showing clinically significant levels of psychopathology. Identification of biologically-grounded subtypes of internalizing disorders may assist in targeting early interventions and assessing longitudinal prognosis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAuthorship has major implications for a researchers promotion and tenure, future funding, and career opportunities. Due in part to these high-stakes consequences, many journals require authors to meet formal authorship criteria, e.g. the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship. Yet on multiple surveys, researchers admit to violating these criteria, suggesting that authorship practices are a complex issue. Using qualitative methods, we aimed to unpack the complexities inherent in researchers conceptualizations of questionable authorship practices and to identify factors that make researchers vulnerable to engaging in such practices.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe conducted an interview study with a purposeful sample of 26 North American medical education researchers holding MD (n=17) and PhD (n=9) degrees and representing a range of career stages. We asked participants to respond to two vignettes - one portraying honorary authorship, the other describing an author order scenario - and then to describe related authorship experiences. Through thematic analysis, we found that participants, even when familiar with ICMJE criteria, conceptualized questionable authorship practices in various ways and articulated several ethical gray areas. We identified personal and situational factors, including hierarchy, resource dependence, institutional culture and gender, that contributed to participants vulnerability to and involvement in questionable authorship practices. Participants described negative instances of questionable authorship practices as well as situations in which these practices occurred for virtuous purposes. Participants rationalized that engagement in questionable authorship practices, while technically violating authorship criteria, could be reasonable when the practices seemed to benefit science and junior researchers. Participants described negative instances of questionable authorship practices as well as situations in which these practices occurred for virtuous purposes. Participants rationalized that engagement in questionable authorship practices, while technically violating authorship criteria, could be reasonable when the practices seemed to benefit science and junior researchers.\\n\\nConclusionAuthorship guidelines, such as the ICMJE criteria, portray authorship decisions as black and white, effectively sidestepping key dimensions that create ethical shades of gray. Our findings show that researchers generally recognize these shades of gray and in some cases acknowledge breaking or bending the rules themselves. Sometimes, their flexibility in applying rules of authorship is driven by benevolent aims that align with their own values or prevailing norms such as generosity and inclusivity. Other times, their participation in questionable authorship practices is framed not as a choice, but rather as a consequence of their vulnerability to individual or system factors beyond their control. Taken together, the findings reported here provide insights that may help researchers and institutions move beyond recognition of the challenges of authorship and contribute to the development of informed, evidence-based solutions for questionable authorship practices.",

Since, there are the slight differences between healthy and disorder brains, investigation in the complex topology of human brain functional networks is difficult and complicated task with the growth of evaluation criteria. Recently, graph theory and deep learning applications have spread widely to understanding human cognitive functions that are linked to gene expression and related distributed spatial patterns. Irregular graph analysis has been widely applied in many brain recognition domains, these applications might involve both node-centric and graph-centric tasks. In this paper, we discuss about individual Variational Autoencoder and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for the region of interest identification areas of brain which do not have normal connection when apply certain tasks. Here, we identified a framework of Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE) with hyper sphere distributer for functional data analysis in brain imaging studies that is underlying non-Euclidean structure, in learning of strong rigid graphs among large scale data. In addition, we distinguish the possible mode correlations in abnormal brain connections.",

    "abstract": "Recent technology has made it possible to measure DNA methylation profiles in a cost-effective and comprehensive genome-wide manner using array-based technology for epigenome-wide association studies. However, identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) remains a challenging task because of the complexities in DNA methylation data. Supervised methods typically focus on the regions that contain consecutive highly significantly differentially methylated CpGs in the genome, but may lack power for detecting small but consistent changes when few CpGs pass stringent significance threshold after multiple comparison. Unsupervised methods group CpGs based on genomic annotations first and then test them against phenotype, but may lack specificity because the regional boundaries of methylation are often not well defined. We present coMethDMR, a flexible, powerful, and accurate tool for identifying DMRs. Instead of testing all CpGs within a genomic region, coMethDMR carries out an additional step that selects co-methylated sub-regions first. Next, coMethDMR tests association between methylation levels within the sub-region and phenotype via a random coefficient mixed effects model that models both variations between CpG sites within the region and differential methylation simultaneously. coMethDMR offers well-controlled Type I error rate, improved specificity, focused testing of targeted genomic regions, and is available as an open-source R package.",

Here, we demonstrate that the splicing factor hnRNP M is a critical repressor of innate immune gene expression and that its function is regulated by pathogen sensing cascades. Loss of hnRNP M leads to hyperinduction of a unique regulon of inflammatory and antimicrobial genes, including IL6, Mx1, and Gbp5, following a variety of innate immune stimuli. While mutating specific serines on hnRNP M had little effect on its ability to control pre-mRNA splicing or transcript levels of \\\"housekeeping\\\" genes in resting macrophages, it greatly impacted the proteins ability to dampen induction of specific innate immune transcripts following activation of pathogen sensing cascades. These data reveal a previously unappreciated role for pattern recognition receptor signaling in controlling splicing factor phosphorylation and establish pre-mRNA splicing as a critical regulatory node in defining innate immune outcomes.",

The present study reports the annotation of genomes from P. aeruginosa and Sphinogobacterium sp. that were isolated from compost, based on their ability to degrade poly(lactic acid), PLA, at mesophillic temperatures (~30{degrees}C). Draft genomes of both the strains were assembled from Illumina reads, annotated and viewed with an aim of gaining insight into the genetic elements involved in degradation of PLA. The draft-assembled genome of strain Sphinogobacterium strain S2 was 5,604,691 bp in length with 435 contigs (maximum length of 434,971 bp) and an average G+C content of 43.5%. The assembled genome of P. aeruginosa strain S3 was 6,631,638 bp long with 303 contigs (maximum contig length of 659,181 bp) and an average G+C content 66.17 %. A total of 5,385 (60% with annotation) and 6,437 (80% with annotation) protein-coding genes were predicted for strains S2 and S3 respectively. Catabolic genes for biodegradation of xenobiotic and aromatic compounds were identified on both draft genomes. Both strains were found to have the genes attributable to the establishment and regulation of biofilm, with more extensive annotation for this in S3. The genome of P. aeruginosa S3 had the complete cascade of genes involved in the transport and utilization of lactate while Sphinogobacterium strain S2 lacked lactate permease, consistent with its inability to grow on lactate. As a whole, our results reveal and predict the genetic elements providing both strains with the ability to degrade PLA at mesophilic temperature.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the timing of incoming information allows the brain to optimize information processing in dynamic environments. Behaviorally, temporal expectations have been shown to facilitate processing of events at expected time points, such as sounds that coincide with the beat in musical rhythm. Yet, temporal expectations can develop based on different forms of structure in the environment, not just the regularity afforded by a musical beat. Little is still known about how different types of temporal expectations are neurally implemented and affect performance. Here, we orthogonally manipulated the periodicity and predictability of rhythmic sequences to examine the mechanisms underlying beat-based and memory-based temporal expectations, respectively. Behaviorally and using EEG, we looked at the effects of beat-based and memory-based expectations on auditory processing when rhythms were task relevant or task irrelevant. At expected time points, both beat-based and memory-based expectations facilitated target detection and led to attenuation of P1 and N1 responses, even when expectations were task-irrelevant (unattended). For beat-based expectations, we additionally found reduced target detection and enhanced N1 responses for events at unexpected time points (e.g., off-beat), regardless of the presence of memory-based expectations or task relevance. This latter finding supports the notion that periodicity selectively induces rhythmic fluctuations in neural excitability and furthermore indicates that while beat-based and memory-based expectations may similarly affect auditory processing of expected events, their underlying neural mechanisms may be different.",

    "abstract": "The estimation of limbs position is critical for motor control. While motor adaptation changes the estimation of limb position in volitional arm movements, this has not been observed in locomotion. We hypothesized that split-belt walking with the legs moving at different speeds changes the estimation of the legs position when taking a step. Thus, we assessed young subjects perception of step length (i.e., inter-feet distance at foot landing) when they moved their legs (active perception) or these were moved by the experimenter (passive perception). Step lengths active, but not passive perception was altered by split-belt walking; indicating that adapted efferent inputs changed the perceived limbs position without changing information from sensory signals. These perceptual shifts were sensitive to how they were tested: they were observed in the trailing, but not the leading leg, and they were more salient when tested with short than long step lengths. Our results suggest that sensory changes following motor adaptation might arise from mismatched limb position estimates from different sensory sources (i.e., proprioception and vision), which is less prominent in walking. We also speculate that split-belt walking could improve the deficient perception of step length post-stroke, which contributes to their gait asymmetry impairing patients mobility.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAnimal models are used to test the safety and efficacy of drugs. They are often administered to rodents in the drinking water, but it has some limitations, such as the drug stability, variations of water consumption and body mass. We investigated telmisartan (TEL) stability in mice drinking water by UV spectrophotometry, and if water intake and body mass fluctuations change drug ingestion.\\n\\nMethodsFemale C57BL/6 mice at two months old, were fed for eight weeks with a purified AIN93M diet, or a high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFHS). TEL 5 mg/Kg/day was administered ad libitum to mice in the drinking water during three weeks concomitant with diets, summing 11 weeks of diet feeding.\\n\\nResultsUV spectrophotometry could detect TEL at the wavelength of 300 nm, and it remained stable in mice drinking water for seven days, at the concentration expected. Mice gain weight after eight weeks on high-fat high-sucrose diet feeding, and TEL 5 mg/kg/day in the drinking water for three weeks reduced it. TEL did not change water intake. Not adjusting TEL concentration weekly would lead to a higher intake of TEL by mice.\\n\\nDiscussionWe demonstrated that body mass and water intake fluctuations significantly change the amount of drug that the animal receive, and it would add a bias to the experiment. TEL remains stable for at least seven days in wrapped mice water bottles in the animal care facility, and UV spectrophotometry proved to be a simple and low-cost method to detect TEL in mice drinking water.",

To understand development in maize and sorghum, closely-related species with architecturally distinct inflorescences, we collected RNAseq profiles encompassing inflorescence body plan specification in both species. We reconstructed molecular ontogenies from 40 B73 maize tassels and 47 BTx623 sorghum panicles and separated them into transcriptional stages. To discover new markers of inflorescence development, we used random forest machine learning to determine stage by RNAseq. We used two descriptions of transcriptional conservation to identify hourglass-like developmental stages.

Here we show that the coiled-coil protein CCDC186 controls sorting by exit. Ccdc186 KO insulinoma cells secrete less insulin, fail to retain insulin and carboxypeptidase E in mature DCVs at the cell periphery, and fail to remove carboxypeptidase D from immature DCVs. A mutation affecting the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex causes similar defects in DCV cargo retention and removal.

    "abstract": "A metagenomic study was conducted to investigate the impact of raw wastewater use for irrigation in urban agriculture on the development of bacterial resistance in soil. Soil samples were collected in two African countries, from three different cities (each with irrigated and non-irrigated plots). Basic physical and chemical analysis were conducted, and the presence of selected antibiotic residues was assessed. Microbial DNA was extracted, quantified and sequenced. Microbial population structure and function, presence of horizontally transferable antibiotic resistance genes and Enterobacteriaceae plasmids replicons were analysed using bioinformatics. The relative prevalence of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and sequence reads coding for microbial adaptation and growth were higher in irrigated fields; 33 and 26 transferable ARGs were found in irrigated and non-irrigated fields sequence reads, respectively. Extended spectrum {beta}-lactam genes identified in irrigated fields included blaCARB-3, blaOXA-347, blaOXA-5 and blaRm3. Concentration of sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin in soils influenced the selection of antibiotic resistance genes encoding resistance against amphenicol, {beta}-lactams, and tetracyclines. Ten Enterobacteriaceae plasmid amplicon groups were identified in the fields, five were common to both, two (IncW and IncP1) and three (IncY, IncFIB and IncFIA) were found in irrigated and non-irrigated fields, respectively.\\n\\nIn conclusion, wastewater irrigation affected both soil microbial diversity and functions. Irrigated fields have more diverse transferable antibiotic resistance genes, including ESBL genes that encode resistance to {beta}-lactams antibiotics, except cephamycins and carbapenems. Even more, critical concentrations of antibiotic residues select for multiple and cross resistance. The findings from African cities show that wastewater irrigation in urban agriculture presents a serious public health risk for farmworkers and consumers by spread of bacterial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Electro-encephalography (EEG) source connectivity is an emerging approach to estimate brain networks with high time/space resolution. Here, we aim to evaluate the effect of different functional connectivity (FC) methods on the EEG-source space networks at rest. The two main families of FC methods tested are: i) the FC methods that do not remove the zero-lag connectivity including the Phase Locking Value (PLV) and the Amplitude Envelope Correlation (AEC) and ii) the FC methods that remove the zero-lag connections such as the Phase Lag Index (PLI) and orthogonalisation approach combined with PLV (PLVorth) and AEC (AECorth). Methods are evaluated on resting state dense-EEG signals recorded from 20 healthy participants. Networks obtained by each FC method are compared with fMRI networks at rest (from the Human Connectome Project -HCP-, N=487). Results show low correlations for all the FC methods, however PLV and AEC networks are significantly correlated with fMRI networks ({rho} = 0.12, p = 1.93x10-8 and {rho} = 0.06, p = 0.007, respectively), while other methods are not. These observations are consistent for each EEG frequency bands and for different FC matrices threshold. Furthermore, the effect of electrode density was also tested using four EEG montages (dense-EEG 256 electrodes, 128, 64 and 32 electrodes). Results show no significant differences between the four EEG montages in terms of correlations with the fMRI networks. Our main message here is to be careful when selecting the FC methods and mainly those that remove the zero-lag connections as they can affect the network characteristics. More comparative studies (based on simulation and real data) are still needed in order to make EEG source connectivity a mature technique to address questions in cognitive and clinical neuroscience.",

Here, we argue for extensive departures from the standard approach to better account for evolutionary contingencies. Crucially, we incorporate considerations of volatility minimization, motivated by interim extinction risk in finite populations, within a finite time horizon approach to growth maximization. We find that a game-theoretic competitive-optimality approach best captures these additional constraints and derive the equilibria solutions under various fitness payoff functions.",

    "abstract": "Rhodnius prolixus is amongst the most important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Americas, putting thousands of people at risk of contracting Chagas Disease. This insect is also one of the most important models in insect physiology, especially regarding the blood-feeding process. However, studies on R. prolixus genetics lagged, and our understanding on the regulation of gene expression is incipient. Transcriptomes have the power to study the expression of thousands of genes in a single experiment. A comprehensive R. prolixus transcriptome was performed in 2014, sequencing RNA from different tissues (anterior gut, midgut, posterior gut, rectum, ovaries, fat body, maphigian tubules, and testicles). However, on that occasion, only the gut transcriptome was deeply analysed. Here we evaluated the results of the testicles transcriptome of R. prolixus with the objective to find and understand genes that could have an important role in male reproduction. We found, that from the 25,673 transcripts assembled in the whole transcriptome, 5,365 have a testicle specific expression pattern. As expected, amongst the most abundant families of transcripts, are those related to spermatogenesis and male fertility, such as myosins, actins, and dyneins. To our surprise, lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors (serpins), and lysozymes also were highly abundant in testicles. The role of these classes of genes are well known in other tissues, such as salivary glands and gut, but very little is known on their role in male reproduction (and we proposed here a few hypothesis that could be tested to address the role of these genes in male fertility). It would be interesting to study further the role of these genes on R. prolixus male fertility. Finally, as a reflection of the lack of knowledge on triatomine genetics, we found that almost half of the transcripts in R. prolixus testicles have no similarities to any other genes on reference databases. Our study shows that we still have a lot to know and to understand about reproduction in triatomine, especially in males. Besides the large number of genes without described function (possibly novel genes), there are those in which the function is known for other tissues, and we can only guess, at best, the role and importance of such genes for triatomine male fertility.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe understanding of the biology of insects vectors of parasitic diseases is key to the development of strategies of public health. For decades, the studies on the biology of male insects vectors of diseases was neglected, since in many cases female insects are those with relevant role in the spread of diseases. With the development of genomics, large scale studies to compare differential gene expression (transcriptomics) among different tissues, developmental stages, and sex became accessible. In this study, we looked at the physiology of the male reproductive organs of the vector of Chagas disease Rhodnius prolixus. This is a first glimpse, from a perspective of genes differentially expressed in male gonads, in such insects. We also performed an effort to link all identified genes with the insect genome published in 2015. We found ~14,000 genes expressed in the testicles, from which 5,635 genes are expressed exclusively in male reproductive organs. From the ~14,000 genes, we were able to attribute putative biological functions to 6,372 genes, which allowed us to draw a bigger picture on how these genes contribute to male fertility. This study now opens the door for further in-depth studies to find key genes for R. prolixus reproductive biology.",

    "abstract": "Hedgehog (Hh) ligands act as morphogens to direct patterning and proliferation during embryonic development. Protein kinase A (PKA) is a central negative regulator of Hh signalling, and in the absence of Hh ligands, PKA activity prevents inappropriate expression of Hh target genes. The Gs- coupled receptor Gpr161 contributes to the basal Hh repression machinery by activating PKA, although the extent of this contribution is unclear. Here we show that loss of Gpr161 in zebrafish leads to constitutive activation of low-, but not high-level Hh target gene expression in the neural tube. In contrast, in the myotome, both high- and low-level Hh signalling is constitutively activated in the absence of Gpr161 function. Our results suggest that the relative contribution of Gpr161 to basal repression of Hh signalling is tissue-specific. Distinct combinations of G-protein-coupled receptors may allow the fine-tuning of PKA activity to ensure the appropriate sensitivity to Hh across different tissues.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem services (ES) are fundamental to human beings livelihoods, production and survival. However, the spatial mismatch between ES supply and demand is a common phenomenon. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) provide a way to promote the complementary advantages and benefits equilibrium between ES supplier and beneficiary. At present, PES is mainly based on the tradeoff between the profit and loss of ecological conservation. The quantifying of PES mainly uses the opportunity cost of ES supplier and follows the principle of additionality, which neglects the benefits that arise from the basic (contrast to additional) ES experienced by ES beneficiary and ignores the rights and interests of ES supplier who supplies the basic ES. To resolve this problem, we proposed that we should set the value of ES experienced by ES beneficiary as the quantitative indicator of PES. Here, we introduced a new indicator (optional capacity value, OCV) to implement this idea. The ES OCV indicates the optional capacity of supporting the total value produced by human beings economic and social activities provided by the total volume of an ES. In this paper, we calculated the ES OCV of water provision in Zhujiang River Basin (Pearl River Basin), China. Then, we discussed three scenarios of quantifying PES, based on the principles of (1) interests sharing and responsibilities bearing and (2) equal pay for equal work. The results showed that the ES OCV could describe the conditions that water resources in a hydrologic unit not only provide benefits to the hydrologic unit itself, but also provide benefits to downstream hydrologic units, and then could be a quantitative indicator for PES. This research provides a new PES scheme which would promote the coordinated development and ecological conservation among the regions with mismatch between ES supply and demand.",

    "abstract": "The biological origin of life expectancy remains a fundamental and unanswered scientific question with important ramifications for human health, especially as the bulk of burden of human healthcare shifts from infectious to age-related diseases. The striking variability in life-span among animals occupying similar ecological niches1 and the numerous mutations that have been shown to increase lifespan in model organisms2-5 point to a considerable genetic contribution. Using mammalian comparative genomics, we correlate lifespan phenotypes with relative evolutionary rates, a measure of evolutionary selective pressure6. Our analysis demonstrates that many genes and pathways are under increased evolutionary constraint in both Long-Lived Large-bodied mammals (3L) and mammals Exceptionally Long-Lived given their size (ELL), suggesting that these genes and pathways contribute to the maintenance of both traits. For 3L species, we find strong evolutionary constraint on multiple pathways involved in controlling carcinogenesis, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and immune pathways. These findings provide additional perspective on the well-known Petos Paradox that large animals with large numbers of cells do not get cancer at higher rates than smaller animals with fewer cells7. For the ELL phenotype, our analysis strongly implicates pathways involved in DNA repair, further supporting the importance of DNA repair processes in aging8-12. Moreover, these correlations with lifespan phenotypes are consistent across the entire mammalian phylogeny, suggesting that additional constraint on these pathways is a universal requirement for long lifespan.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCarbapenem resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) remain urgent antimicrobial resistance threats. Approximately half of CRE clinical isolates lack carbapenem hydrolyzing enzymes and develop carbapenem resistance through alternative mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the development of carbapenem resistance mechanisms from clonal, recurrent extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase positive Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bacteremia isolates in a vulnerable patient population.\n\nMethodsThis study investigated a historical, retrospective cohort of ESBL-E bacteremia cases in the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) from January 2015 to July 2016. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses were performed to identify clonal, recurrent ESBL-E isolates developing carbapenem resistance. Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing data were used to generate consensus assemblies and to identify signatures of mobile genetic element mediated amplification and transposition of antimicrobial resistance genes. Serial passaging experiments were performed on a set of clinical ST131 ESBL-E isolates to recapitulate in vivo observations. qPCR and qRT-PCR were used to determine respective copy number and transcript levels of {beta}-lactamase genes.\n\nResults116 ESBL-E bacteremia cases were identified, 16 of which had documented recurrent infections. Four serial, recurrent isolates displayed a carbapenem resistant phenotype, three without the acquisition of a known carbapenemase. These three isolates had non-carbapenemase-producing CRE (non-CP-CRE) mechanisms driven by IS26- and ISEcp1-mediated amplification of respective translocatable units (TU) and transposition units (TPU) harboring both blaOXA-1 and blaCTX-M variants with concomitant outer membrane porin disruption. The TU and TPU structures inserted into the open reading frames of outer membrane porin genes in a subset of non-CP-CRE isolates. Serial passage of an index ST131 ESBL-E isolate under selective carbapenem exposure resulted in chromosomal amplification of modular, TUs harboring {beta}-lactamase genes with concomitant porin inactivation, recapitulating the in vivo carbapenem resistance progression. Long-read sequencing of two additional MDACC bacteremia strains identified similar non-CP-CRE mechanisms observed in the serial isolates.\n\nConclusionsNon-CP-CRE de novo mechanisms were the primary driver of CRE development in recurrent bacteremia cases within this vulnerable patient population. The incorporation of long-read ONT data into AMR surveillance platforms is critical to identify high-risk CRE isolates that are difficult to identify with low-resolution phenotypic and molecular characterization methods.",

Using in vivo fixed-potential amperometry with carbon-fiber microelectrodes in anesthetized mice, the current study assessed hemispheric lateralization of stimulation-evoked dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the influence of the cerebellum in regulating this reward-associated pathway. Our results suggest that cerebellar output can modulate mesolimbic dopamine transmission, and this modulation contributes to asymmetrically lateralized dopamine release. Dopamine release did not differ between hemispheres when evoked by medial forebrain bundle (MFB) stimulation; however, dopamine release was significantly greater in the right NAc relative to the left when evoked by electrical stimulation of the cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN). Furthermore, cross-hemispheric talk between the left and right cerebellar DN does not seem to influence mesolimbic release given that lidocaine infused into the DN opposite to the stimulated DN did not alter release. These studies may provide a neurochemical mechanism for studies identifying the cerebellum as a relevant node for reward, motivational behavior, saliency, and inhibitory control. An increased understanding of the lateralization of dopaminergic systems may reveal novel targets for pharmacological interventions in neuropathology of the cerebellum and extending projections.",

    "abstract": "Typical brittle stars have five radially symmetrical arms, which coordinate to move their body in a certain direction. However, some species of them show individual difference in the number of arms. We found this trait unique since intact legged animals each own a fixed number of limbs in general. How does a single species manage such different numbers of motile organs to realize adaptive locomotion? We here described four-, five-, six-, and seven-armed locomotion with the aim to generalize a common rule which is flexible with arm numbers in brittle stars. We mechanically stimulated an arm in Ophiactis brachyaspis to analyze escape direction and arm movements. Gathering quantitative indices and employing Bayesian statistical modeling, we figured out an average locomotion: regardless of the total number of arms, a front position emerges at one of the second neighboring arms to a mechanically stimulated arm, while side arms adjacent to the front synchronously work as left and right rowers. We suggest a model where some afferent signal runs either clockwise or anticlockwise along the nerve ring while linearly counting how many arms it passes. This idea would explain how  left and right emerges in a radially symmetrical body via a decentralized system.",

    "abstract": "Although many biocontrol bacteria can be used to improve plant tolerance to stresses and to promote plant growth, the hostile environmental conditions on plant phyllosphere and the limited knowledge on bacterial colonization on plant phyllosphere minimized the beneficial effects produced by the biocontrol bacteria. Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain GJ-22 is known as a phyllosphere biocontrol agent. In this paper we described detailed processes of strain GJ-22 colony establishment at various colonization stages. We have shown that the preferable location sites of bacterial aggregates on leaf phyllosphere are grooves between plant epidermal cells. In this study, we categorized bacterial colonies into four phases. Analyses of expressions of plant defense-related genes showed that, starting from Phase III, bacterial cells in the Type 3 and Type 4 colonies started produce unidentified signals to induce host defense again Tobacco mosaic virus infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report focused on the colonization process of a phyllosphere biocontrol agent.",
