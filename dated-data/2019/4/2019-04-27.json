    "abstract": "The vast majority of human mutations have minor allele frequencies (MAF) under 1%, with the plurality observed only once (i.e., \\\"singletons\\\"). While Mendelian diseases are predominantly caused by rare alleles, their cumulative contribution to complex phenotypes remains largely unknown. We develop and rigorously validate an approach to jointly estimate the contribution of all alleles, including singletons, to phenotypic variation. We apply our approach to transcriptional regulation, an intermediate between genetic variation and complex disease. Using whole genome DNA and lymphoblastoid cell line RNA sequencing data from 360 European individuals, we conservatively estimate that singletons contribute ~25% of cis-heritability across genes (dwarfing the contributions of other frequencies). Strikingly, the majority (~76%) of singleton heritability derives from ultra-rare variants absent from thousands of additional samples. We develop a novel inference procedure to demonstrate that our results are consistent with rampant purifying selection shaping the regulatory architecture of most human genes.",

    "abstract": "The plant-pathogenic virus, tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), encodes a structural glycoprotein (GN) that, like with other bunyavirus/vector interactions, serves a role in viral attachment and possibly entry into arthropod vector host cells. It is well documented that Frankliniella occidentalis is one of seven competent thrips vectors of TSWV transmission to plant hosts, however, the insect molecules that interact with viral proteins, such as GN, during infection and dissemination in thrips vector tissues are unknown. The goals of this project were to identify TSWV-interacting proteins (TIPs) that interact directly with TSWV GN and to localize expression of these proteins in relation to virus in thrips tissues of principle importance along the route of dissemination. We report here the identification of six TIPs from first instar larvae (L1), the most acquisition-efficient developmental stage of the thrips vector. Sequence analyses of these TIPs revealed homology to proteins associated with the infection cycle of other vector-borne viruses. Immunolocalization of the TIPs in L1s revealed robust expression in the midgut and salivary glands of F. occidentalis, the tissues most important during virus infection, replication and plant-inoculation. The TIPs and GN interactions were validated using protein-protein interaction assays. Two of the thrips proteins, endocuticle structural glycoprotein and cyclophilin, were found to be consistent interactors with GN. These newly discovered thrips protein-GN interactions are essential towards better understanding of transmission of persistent propagative plant viruses by their vectors, as well as for developing new strategies of insect pest management and virus resistance in plants.\\n\\nImportance StatementThrips-transmitted viruses cause devastating losses to numerous food crops worldwide. For negative-sense RNA viruses that infect plants, the arthropod serves as a host as well by supporting virus replication in specific tissues and organs of the vector. The goal of this work was to identify vector/host proteins that bind directly to the viral attachment protein and thus may play a role in the infection cycle in the insect. Using the model plant bunyavirus, tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), and the most efficient thrips vector, we identified and validated six TSWV-interacting proteins from Frankliniella occidentalis first instar larvae. Two proteins, an endocuticle structural glycoprotein and cyclophilin, were able to interact directly with the TSWV attachment protein, GN, in insect cells. The TSWV GN-interacting proteins provide new targets for disrupting the virus-vector interaction and could be putative determinants of vector competence.",

    "abstract": "Females across many internally fertilising taxa store sperm, often in specialised storage organs in their reproductive tracts. In birds, several hundred sperm storage tubules exist in the utero-vaginal junction of the oviduct and there is growing evidence that sperm storage in these tubules is selective. The mechanisms underlying female sperm storage in birds remain unknown due to our limited ability to make three dimensional, live observations inside the large, muscular avian oviduct. Here, we describe a new application of fluorescence selective plane illumination microscopy to optically section oviduct tissue from zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata females label-free, by harnessing tissue autofluorescence. Our data provide the first description of the 3D structure of sperm storage organs in any vertebrate and reveal the presence of gate-like constricted openings that may play a role in sperm selection.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceFemale birds can store sperm in microscopic tubular structures in their reproductive tract for up to several months, depending on species. Studying these sperm storage tubules has been a major challenge due to the muscular and opaque nature of reproductive tracts in birds. We have developed a new method for imaging live reproductive tract tissue using selective plane illumination microscopy, a fluorescence microscopy technique. From these images, we could extract three-dimensional measurements of sperm storage tubules and found these structures to have a gate-like constriction, providing evidence that females can actively select sperm at storage and ultimately influence the paternity of her offspring. Understanding these reproductive adaptations can help improve captive breeding programs and similar conservation strategies.",

    "abstract": "For proper chromosome segregation, sister kinetochores must interact with microtubules from opposite spindle poles; this is called bi-orientation. To establish bi-orientation prior to chromosome segregation, any aberrant kinetochore-microtubule interaction must be resolved (error correction) by Aurora B kinase that phosphorylates outer kinetochore components. Aurora B differentially regulates kinetochore attachment to the microtubule plus end and its lateral side (end-on and lateral attachment, respectively). However, it is still not fully understood how kinetochore-microtubule interactions are exchanged during error correction. Here we reconstituted the kinetochore-microtubule interface of budding yeast in vitro by attaching the Ndc80 complexes (Ndc80C) to nanobeads. These Ndc80C-nanobeads recapitulated in vitro the lateral and end-on attachments of authentic kinetochores, on dynamic microtubules loaded with the Dam1 complex. This in vitro assay enabled the direct comparison of lateral and end-on attachment strength and showed that Dam1 phosphorylation by Aurora B makes the end-on attachment weaker than the lateral attachment. We suggest that the Dam1 phosphorylation weakens interaction with the Ndc80 complex, disrupts the end-on attachment and promotes the exchange to a new lateral attachment, leading to error correction. Our study reveals a fundamental mechanism of error correction for establishment of bi-orientation.",

    "abstract": "Low-frequency vibrational excitations of protein macromolecules in the terahertz frequency region are suggested to contribute to many biological processes such as enzymatic catalysis, intra-protein energy/charge transport, recognition, and allostery. To explain high effectiveness of these processes, two possible mechanisms of the long-lived excitation were proposed by H. Frohlich and A.S. Davydov which relate to either vibrational modes or solitary waves, respectively. In this paper, we developed a quantum dynamic model of vibrational excitation in -helical proteins interacting with the aqueous environment. In the model, we distinguished three coupled subsystems, i.e. (i) a chain of hydrogen-bonded peptide groups (PGs), interacting with (ii) the subsystem of the side-chain residuals which in turn interacts with (iii) the environment, surrounding water responsible for dissipation and fluctuation in the system. It was shown that the equation of motion for phonon variables of the PG chain can be transformed to nonlinear Schrodinger equation which admits bifurcation into the solution corresponding to the weak damped vibrational modes (Frohlich-type regime) and Davydov solitons. A bifurcation parameter is derived through the strength of phonon-phonon interaction between the side-chains and hydration-shell water molecules. As shown, the energy of these excited states is pumped through the interaction of the side-chains with fluctuating water environment of the proteins. The suggested mechanism of the collective vibrational mode excitation is discussed in connection with the recent experiments on the long-lived collective protein excitations in the terahertz frequency region and vibrational energy transport pathways in proteins.",

    "abstract": "Perception of sensory stimulation is influenced by numerous psychological variables. One example is placebo analgesia, where expecting low pain causes a painful stimulus to feel less painful. Yet, because pain evolved to signal threats to survival, it should be maladaptive for highly-erroneous expectations to yield unrealistic pain experiences. Therefore, we hypothesised that a cue followed by a highly discrepant stimulus intensity, which generates a large prediction error, will have a weaker influence on the perception of that stimulus. To test this hypothesis we collected two independent pain-cueing datasets. The second dataset and the analysis plan were preregistered (osf.io/5r6z7). Regression modelling revealed that reported pain intensities were best explained by a quartic polynomial model of the prediction error. The results indicated that the influence of cues on perceived pain decreased when stimulus intensity was very different from expectations, suggesting that prediction error size has an immediate functional role in pain perception.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOleaginous yeasts are potent hosts for the renewable production of lipids and harbor great potential for derived products, such as biofuels. Several promising processes have been described that produce hydrocarbon drop-in biofuels based on fatty acid decarboxylation and fatty aldehyde decarbonylation. Unfortunately, besides fatty aldehyde toxicity and high reactivity, the most investigated enzyme, aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase, shows unfavorable catalytic properties which hindered high yields in previous metabolic engineering approaches.\\n\\nResultsTo demonstrate an alternative alkane production pathway for oleaginous yeasts, we describe the production of diesel-like, odd-chain alkanes and alkenes, by heterologously expressing a recently discovered light-driven oxidase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) in Yarrowia lipolytica. Initial experiments showed that only strains engineered to have an increased pool of free fatty acids showed to be susceptible to sufficient decarboxylation. Providing these strains with glucose and light in a synthetic medium resulted in titers of 10.9 mg/L of hydrocarbons. Using custom 3D printed labware for lighting bioreactors, and an automated pulsed glycerol fed-batch strategy, intracellular titers of 58.7 mg/L were achieved.\\n\\nConclusionsOleaginous yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica can transform renewable resources such as glycerol into fatty acids and lipids. By heterologously expressing a fatty acid photodecarboxylase from the algae Chlorella variabilis hydrocarbons were produced in several scales from microwell plate to 400 ml bioreactors. The developed bioprocess shows a route to the renewable production of hydrocarbons for a variety of applications ranging from representing a substrate for further enzymatic or chemical modification or as a drop-in biofuel blend.\\n\\nShort abstractOleaginous yeasts are potent hosts for the renewable production of lipids, fatty acids and derived products such as biofuels.

The underlying mechanisms of this development, however, are still poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a thorough investigation of error processing in a Flanker task in a cross-sectional sample of participants 8 to 19 years of age (n = 98). We examined age-differences in event related potentials known to be associated with error processing, namely the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe), as well as their relationships with task performance, post-error adjustments and regional cingulate cortex thickness and surface area. We found that ERN amplitude increased with age, while Pe amplitude remained constant. A more negative ERN was associated with higher task accuracy and faster reaction times, while a more positive Pe was associated with higher accuracy, independently of age. When estimating post-error adjustments from trials following both incongruent and congruent trials, post-error slowing and post-error improvement in accuracy both increased with age, but this was only found for post-error slowing when only analysing trials following incongruent trials. There were no age-independent associations between either ERN or Pe amplitude and cingulate cortex thickness or area measures.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancers display phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and several lines of evidence support the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in certain breast cancers, a minor population of cells capable of tumor initiation and metastatic dissemination. Identifying factors that regulate the CSC phenotype is therefore important for developing strategies to treat metastatic disease. The Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1 (Id1) and its closely related family member Inhibitor of Differentiation 3 (Id3) (collectively termed Id) are expressed by a diversity of stem cells and are required for metastatic dissemination in experimental models of breast cancer. In this study, we show that ID1 is expressed in rare neoplastic cells within ER-negative breast cancers. To address the function of Id1 expressing cells within tumors, we developed two independent murine models of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in which a genetic reporter permitted the prospective isolation of Id1+ cells. Id1+ cells are enriched for self-renewal in tumorsphere assays in vitro and for tumor initiation in vivo. Conversely, depletion of Id1 and Id3 in the 4T1 murine model of TNBC demonstrates that Id1/3 are required for cell proliferation and self-renewal in vitro, as well as primary tumor growth and metastatic colonization of the lung in vivo. Using combined bioinformatic analysis, we have defined a novel mechanism of Id protein function via negative regulation of the Roundabout Axon Guidance Receptor Homolog 1 (Robo1) leading to activation of a Myc transcriptional programme.",

This performance may be affected by the subjects adjusting their initial posture in anticipation of the perturbation.\\n\\nResearch questionsDo elderly fallers and non-fallers adjust their posture in anticipation of externally-imposed perturbations in a laboratory setting, and how does this impact their balance recovery performance?\\n\\nMethods21 elderly non-fallers, 18 age-matched elderly fallers and 11 young adults performed both a forward waist-pull perturbation task and a Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT) task. Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded. For each group, we evaluated the balance recovery performance in the perturbation task, change in initial center of mass (CoM) position between the CSRT and the perturbation task, and the influence of initial CoM position on task performance.\\n\\nResultsThe balance recovery performance of elderly fallers was equivalent to elderly non-fallers (p > 0.5 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). All subject groups anticipated forward perturbations by shifting their CoM backward compared to the CSRT task (young: 2.1% of lower limb length, elderly non-fallers: 2.7%, elderly fallers: 2.2%, Hodges-Lehmann estimator, p < 0.001 Mann-Whitney U). This backward shift increases the probability of resisting the traction without taking a step.\\n\\nSignificanceThe ability to anticipate perturbations is preserved in elderly fallers and may explain their preserved balance recovery performance in laboratory-based perturbation tasks.

    "abstract": "Condensins are evolutionarily conserved protein complexes that are required for chromosome segregation during cell division and genome organization during interphase. In C. elegans, a specialized condensin, which forms the core of the dosage compensation complex (DCC) binds to and represses X chromosome transcription. Here, we analyzed DCC localization and effect of DCC depletion and binding on histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and gene expression using ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq. Across the X, DCC binding coincides with gene regulatory sites at active chromatin and not heterochromatin. DCC is required for reducing the levels of active histone modifications, including H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, but not repressive modification H3K9me3 on the X. In X-to-autosome fusion chromosomes, DCC spreading into the autosomal sequences locally reduces the level of H3K4me3 and gene expression. Together, our results suggest that DCC fine-tunes X chromosomal transcription by binding to and modulating the activity of gene regulatory elements through reducing activating histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "With seemingly little effort, humans can both identify an object across large changes in orientation and extend category membership to novel exemplars. Although researchers argue that object shape is crucial in these cases, there are open questions as to how shape is represented for object recognition. Here we tested whether the human visual system incorporates a three-dimensional skeletal descriptor of shape to determine an objects identity. Skeletal models not only provide a compact description of an objects global shape structure, but also provide a quantitative metric by which to compare the visual similarity between shapes. Our results showed that a model of skeletal similarity explained the greatest amount of variance in participants object dissimilarity judgments when compared with other computational models of visual similarity (Experiment 1). Moreover, parametric changes to an objects skeleton led to proportional changes in perceived similarity, even when controlling for another model of structure (Experiment 2). Importantly, participants preferentially categorized objects by their skeletons across changes to local shape contours and non-accidental properties (Experiment 3). Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal structure in vision, not only as a shape descriptor, but also as a diagnostic cue of object identity.",

    "abstract": "Benzoate, a partial uncoupler of the proton motive force (PMF), selects for sensitivity to chloramphenicol and tetracycline in Escherichia coli K-12. Genetic mechanisms of increased benzoate tolerance and decreased drug resistance were analyzed in strains isolated from experimental evolution with benzoate. Transcriptomes showed reversal of benzoate-dependent regulation, including the Gad regulon for acid resistance and multi-drug resistance (MDR). Benzoate-evolved strains knocked down the nitrate reductase narHJ and the acid-consuming hydrogenase Hyd-3, but upregulated OmpF and other porins that admit nutrients and antibiotics. Mutations were found affecting many genes of aromatic catabolism such as folD and add. Several candidate genes from benzoate-evolved strains had a role in benzoate tolerance. Growth with benzoate or salicylate was increased by deletion of the Gad activator ariR, or by deletion of the slp-gadX acid fitness island encoding Gad regulators and the MDR pump MdtEF. Benzoate growth was also increased by deletion of MDR component emrA, the RpoS post-transcriptional regulator cspC, or the adenosine deaminase add. Growth in chloramphenicol with benzoate was decreased by a point mutation in the RNA polymerase alpha-subunit rpoA, which appeared in one chloramphenicol-sensitive benzoate-evolved strain. Growth in chloramphenicol was also decreased by deletion of Mar activator rob, or of rfaY (lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis). Hydrogenase Hyd-3 deletion increased benzoate tolerance. Overall, long-term culture in the presence of benzoate or salicylate favors loss of MDR efflux pumps and of hydrogenases that generate a futile cycle of PMF; and favors upregulation of large-hole porins that increase uptake of fermentable nutrients and of antibiotics.\n\nIMPORTANCEBenzoate is a common food preservative, and salicylate is the active form of aspirin. In E. coli, benzoate derivatives upregulate multiple regulons that export antibiotics and other toxic products, and downregulate large outer-membrane porins that allow antibiotic influx. But benzoate or salicylate exposure causes energy stress by depleting the proton motive force. In the absence of antibiotics, long-term benzoate exposure selects against energy-spending systems such as multi-drug efflux pumps and the proton-consuming hydrogenase. Selection favors upregulation of porins that admit fermentable substrates but also allow entry of antibiotics. Thus, evolution with benzoate requires a tradeoff for antibiotic sensitivity. Benzoate and salicylate are naturally occurring plant signal molecules that may influence the evolution of microbiomes in plants and in animal digestive tracts. Effects on hydrogenase activity may be relevant to the biotechnology of hydrogen production.",

    "abstract": "Two-photon excitation (2PE) microscopy is the imaging modality of choice, when one desires to work with thick biological samples, possibly in-vivo. However, the resolution in two-photon microscopy is poor, below confocal microscopy, and the lack of an optical pinhole becomes apparent in complex samples as reduced quality of optical sectioning. Here, we propose a straightforward implementation of 2PE image scanning microscopy (2PE-ISM) that, by leveraging our recently introduced ISM platform - based on a new single-photon avalanche diode array detector - coupled with a novel blind image reconstruction method, is shown to improve the optical resolution, as well as the overall image quality in various test samples. Most importantly, our 2PE-ISM implementation requires no calibration or other input from the user - it works like any old and familiar two-photon system, but simply produces higher resolution images (in real-time). Making the complexity disappear, in our view, is the biggest novelty here, and the key for making 2PE-ISM mainstream.",

    "abstract": "MotivationElucidation of protein-protein interactions is a necessary step towards understanding the complete repertoire of cellular biochemistry. Given the enormity of the problem, the expenses and limitations of experimental methods, it is imperative that this problem is tackled computationally. In silico predictions of protein interactions entail sampling different conformations of the purported complex and then scoring these to assess for interaction viability. In this study we have devised a new scheme for scoring protein-protein interactions.\n\nResultsOur method, PIZSA (Protein Interaction Z Score Assessment) is a binary classification scheme for identification of stable protein quaternary assemblies (binders/non-binders) based on statistical potentials. The scoring scheme incorporates residue-residue contact preference on the interface with per residue-pair atomic contributions and accounts for clashes. PIZSA can accurately discriminate between native and non-native structural conformations from protein docking experiments and outperform other recently published scoring functions, demonstrated through testing on a benchmark set and the CAPRI Score_set. Though not explicitly trained for this purpose, PIZSA potentials can identify spurious interactions that are artefacts of the crystallization process.\n\nAvailabilityPIZSA is implemented as awebserverat http://cospi.iiserpune.ac.in/pizsa/.\n\nContactmadhusudhan@iiserpune.ac.in",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal network activity is tightly regulated by local inhibitory interneurons. Suppression of inhibition has been proposed to accelerate learning by enhancing network activity and plasticity; however, the activity dynamics of hippocampal interneurons during learning remain poorly understood. Furthermore, it is unknown if individual interneurons are stochastically suppressed across different learning episodes, mirroring the random remapping of place cells, or if instead they exhibit consistent patterns of activity suppression. These critical properties define how inhibition shapes and controls learning at a network level. To uncover the functional circuit dynamics of inhibition during novelty-induced learning, we recorded calcium activity from hippocampal CA1 interneurons using two-photon imaging as mice learned a virtual reality (VR) goal-directed spatial navigation task in new visual contexts. Here we focused on dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM-ints), which powerfully control burst firing and synaptic plasticity in excitatory neurons. We found robust activity suppression in SOM-ints upon exposure to novel virtual environments; activity then recovered over repeated exposures to the novel environment as the animal learned goal locations. At a population level, we found a continuum of activity suppression, from interneurons strongly suppressed to moderately activated during learning. Surprisingly, each interneuron exhibited a stable level of activity modulation: when animals were switched into a second novel environment, the magnitude of activity suppression was strongly correlated across remapping sessions. This work reveals dynamic inhibition suppression triggered by novel environments and the gradual return of inhibition with learning. Furthermore, unlike the stochastic remapping of place cells, inhibitory networks display a stable activity structure across learning episodes. This functional inhibitory circuit architecture suggests that individual interneurons play specialized and stereotyped roles during learning, perhaps by differentially regulating pyramidal subnetworks specialized for plasticity and stability.",

Recently, studies for HCC treatment are focused on cancer immunotherapy, particularly cancer vaccines, to complete and assist other therapies. TPX2 is a microtubule-associated protein necessary for cell division; therefore, alteration in its expression, especially up regulation, is associated with several human carcinomas such as HCC.\\n\\nIn this study, immunoinformatics tools were used to design a rational multi-epitope T vaccine against TPX2 in HCC. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes were predicted and Maltose-binding protein (MBP) was added to the construct as an adjuvant. Evaluation of vaccine properties was indicated that our construct is stable and immunogenic enough to induce relevant responses besides not being allergic. After predicting the tertiary structure and energy minimization, protein-protein docking was performed to calculate the free energy of possible interactions between the vaccine and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to assure that simultaneous complementary responses would be activated by our construct. Finally, Codon optimization and in-silico cloning were performed to ensure the vaccine expression efficiency in the desired host.",

These observations have invoked single-cell multistability view as the dynamical basis of differentiation. However, the robust regulative nature of mammalian development is not captured therein. Considering the well-established role of cell-cell communication in this process, we propose a fundamentally different dynamical treatment in which cellular identities emerge and are maintained on population level, as a novel unique solution of the coupled system. Subcritical systems organization here enables symmetry-breaking to be triggered by cell number increase in a timed, self-organized manner. Robust cell type proportions are thereby an inherent feature of the resulting inhomogeneous solution. This framework is generic, as exemplified for early embryogenesis and neurogenesis cases. Distinct from mechanisms that rely on pre-existing asymmetries, we thus demonstrate that robustness and accuracy necessarily emerge from the cooperative behaviour of growing cell populations during development.",

Fifteen Zinfandel winegrape clone genomes were sequenced and compared to one another using a highly contiguous genome reference produced from one of the clones, Zinfandel 03.\\n\\nThough most heterozygous variants were shared, somatic mutations accumulated in individual and subsets of clones. Overall, heterozygous mutations were most frequent in intergenic space and more frequent in introns than exons. A significantly larger percentage of CpG, CHG, and CHH sites in repetitive intergenic space experienced transition mutations than genic and non-repetitive intergenic spaces, likely because of higher levels of methylation in the region and the increased likelihood of methylated cytosines to spontaneously deaminate. Of the minority of mutations that occurred in exons, larger proportions of these were putatively deleterious when they occurred in relatively few clones.\\n\\nThese data support three major conclusions. First, repetitive intergenic space is a major driver of clone genome diversification. Second, clonal propagation is associated with the accumulation of putatively deleterious mutations. Third, the data suggest selection against deleterious variants in coding regions such that mutations are less frequent in coding than noncoding regions of the genome.",

This convergence of inputs from the bilateral receptive fields allows higher order sensory perception, such as depth perception in the vertebrate visual system and stimulus localization in the auditory system. The functional role of such bilateral convergence in the olfactory system is mostly unknown. To test whether each olfactory bulb contributes a separate piece of olfactory information, and whether information from the bilateral olfactory bulb is integrated, we synchronized the activation of olfactory bulbs with blue light in mice expressing channelrhodopsin in the olfactory sensory neurons and behaviorally assessed the relevance of dual olfactory bulb in olfactory perception. Our findings suggest that each olfactory bulb contributes separate components of olfactory information and mice integrate the olfactory information from each olfactory bulb to identify an olfactory stimulus.\n\nSignificance statementIdentifying an odor is the first step in olfactory coding, as it is critical for the survival of most animals. Previous studies have shown that bilateral olfactory bulbs help rodents to localize the odor source and navigate accordingly. But It is still unclear whether the bilateral olfactory information plays any role in determining odor identity. Here for the first time, using optogenetics and behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that each olfactory bulb provides distinct olfactory information, and rodents integrate information from the two bulbs to identify an odor.",

    "abstract": "Tracking small animal behavior by video is one of the most common tasks in the fields of neuroscience and psychology. Although commercial software exists for the execution of this task, commercial software often presents enormous cost to the researcher, and can also entail purchasing specific hardware setups that are not only expensive but lack adaptability. Moreover, the inaccessibility of the code underlying this software renders them inflexible. Alternatively, available open source options frequently require extensive model training and can be challenging for those inexperienced with programming. Here we present an open source and platform independent set of behavior analysis pipelines using interactive Python (iPython/Jupyter Notebook) that researchers with no prior programming experience can use. Two modules are described. One module can be used for the positional analysis of an individual animal across a session (i.e., location tracking), amenable to a wide range of behavioral tasks including conditioned place preference, water maze, light-dark box, open field, and elevated plus maze, to name but a few. A second module is described for the analysis of conditioned freezing behavior. For both modules, a range of interactive plots and visualizations are available to confirm that chosen parameters produce results that conform to the users approval. In addition, batch processing tools for the fast analysis of multiple videos is provided, and frame-by-frame output makes aligning the data with neural recording data simple. Lastly, options for cropping video frames to mitigate the influence of fiberoptic/electrophysiology cables, analyzing specified portions of time in a video, and defining regions of interest, can be implemented with ease.",

Many PIF1 helicase are multi-domain proteins, but the functions of their non-helicase domains are poorly understood. Here, we characterized how the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 helicase affects its functions both in vivo and in vitro. Removal of the Pif1 NTD alleviated the toxicity associated with Pif1 over-expression in yeast. Biochemically, the N-terminally truncated Pif1 (Pif1{Delta}N) retained in vitro DNA binding, DNA unwinding, and telomerase regulation activities, but these activities differed markedly from those displayed by full-length recombinant Pif1. However, Pif1{Delta}N was still able to synergize with the Hrq1 helicase to inhibit telomerase activity in vitro, similar to full-length Pif1. These data impact our understanding of PIF1 helicase evolution and the roles of these enzymes in the maintenance of genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenomics seeks to use next-generation data to robustly infer an organisms evolutionary history. Yet, the practical caveats of phylogenomics motivates investigation of improved efficiency, particularly when quality of phylogenies are questionable. To achieve improvements, one goal is to maintain or enhance the quality of phylogenetic inference while severely reducing dataset size. We approach this goal by designing an optimized subsample of data with an experimental design whose results are determined on the basis of phylogenetic synecdoche - a comparison of phylogenies inferred from a subsample to phylogenies inferred from the entire dataset. We examine locus mutation rate, saturation, evolutionary divergence, rate heterogeneity, selection, and a priori information content as traits that may determine optimality. Our controlled experimental design is based on 265 loci for 102 blaberoidean cockroaches and 22 outgroup species. High phylogenetic utility is demonstrated by loci with high mutation rate, low saturation, low sequence distance, low rate heterogeneity, and low selection. We found that some phylogenetic information content estimators may not be meaningful for assessing information content a priori. We use these findings to design concatenated datasets with an optimized subsample of 100 loci. The tree inferred from the optimized subsample alignment was largely identical to that inferred from all 265 loci but with less evidence of long branch attraction and improved statistical support. In sum, optimized subsampling can improve tree quality while reducing data collection costs and yielding 4-6x improvements to computation time in tree inference and bootstrapping.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how microbial communities respond to environmental change requires knowing the main drivers of their structure, diversity and potential resilience. Lake Baikal is the worlds most ancient, deep, voluminous, and biodiverse lake, holding 20 percent of unfrozen fresh water that is undergoing rapid warming. Despite its global importance, little is known about Baikals bacterioplankton communities and their drivers. In this extensive survey, we show that temperature, along with stratification, nutrients, and dissolved oxygen, but not geographic distance, define major microbial habitats and community similarity. Mixed layer and deep water communities exhibited contrasting patterns of richness, diversity and evenness, and comprised different cohesive modules in the whole Baikal OTU co-occurrence network. The networks small-world properties indicated likely resistance to perturbations but sensitivity to abundance changes of central, most connected OTUs. Previous studies showed Baikal water temperature rising by over 1.2{degrees}C since 1946, and this trend is predicted to accelerate. Because temperature emerged as the most significant predictor of the mixed layer community structure, we hypothesize that it is most likely to drive future community changes. Understanding how temperature and other abiotic factors structure microbial communities in this and other rapidly changing ecosystems will allow better predictions of ecosystem responses to anthropogenic stressors.",

Natural selection on this growth rate occurred under a set of physicochemical constraints, including mass conservation, reaction kinetics, and limits on dry mass per volume; mathematical models that maximize the balanced growth rate while accounting explicitly for these constraints are inevitably nonlinear and have been restricted to small, non-realistic systems. Here, we lay down a general theory of balanced growth states, providing explicit expressions for protein concentrations, fluxes, and the growth rate. These variables are functions of the concentrations of cellular components, for which we calculate marginal fitness costs and benefits that can be related to metabolic control coefficients. At maximal growth rate, the net benefits of all concentrations are equal. Based solely on physicochemical constraints, the growth balance analysis (GBA) framework introduced here unveils fundamental quantitative principles of cellular growth and leads to experimentally testable predictions.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew and generate all blood cells. Recent studies with single-cell transplants (1-3) and lineage tracing (4, 5) suggest that adult HSCs are diverse in their reconstitution and lineage potentials. However, prospective isolation of these subpopulations has remained challenging. Here, we identify Neogenin-1 (NEO1) as a unique surface marker on a fraction of mouse HSCs labeled with Hoxb5, a specific reporter of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) (6). We show that NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs expand with age and respond to myeloablative stress, while NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs exhibit no significant change in number. NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs are more often in the G2/S cell cycle phase compared to NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs in both young and old bone marrow. Upon serial transplantation, NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation and reduced reconstitution, while NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs are lineage-balanced and stably reconstitute recipients. Gene expression comparison reveals increased expression of cell cycle genes and evidence of lineage-priming in the NEO1+ fraction. Finally, transplanted NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs rarely generate NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs, while NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs repopulate both LT-HSC fractions. This supports a model in which dormant, balanced, NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs can hierarchically precede active, myeloid-biased NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare cells that have the unique ability to regenerate themselves and produce all blood cells throughout life. However, HSCs are functionally heterogeneous and several studies have shown that HSCs can differ in their contribution to major blood lineages. In this study, we discovered that the surface marker, Neogenin-1, can divide mouse HSCs into two subpopulations--one that is more active but biased towards producing myeloid cells and another that is more dormant and capable of equally producing all blood lineages. Neogenin-1 reveals the diversity and hierarchical relationship of HSCs in the mouse bone marrow, enables the prospective isolation of myeloid-biased and balanced HSCs, and opens opportunities to do the same in humans.",

Despite the two approaches are widely used, their possible association may need more attention. To investigate this question, we performed a comparison between PSD and some widely used nodal network metrics (namely strength, clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality), using two different publicly available resting-state EEG datasets, both at scalp and source levels, employing four different FC methods (PLV, PLI, AEC and AECC). Here we show that the two approaches may provide similar information and that their correlation depends on the method used to estimate FC. In particular, our results show a strong correlation between PSD and nodal network metrics derived from FC methods (PLV and AEC) that do not limit the effects of volume conduction/signal leakage. The correlations are less relevant for more conservative FC methods (AECC). These findings suggest that the results derived from the two different approaches may be not independent and should not be treated as distinct analyses. We conclude that it may represent good practice to report the findings from the two approaches in conjunction to have a more comprehensive view of the results.",

    "abstract": "Predicting how populations will respond to ocean change across generations is critical to effective conservation of marine species. One emerging factor is the influence of parental exposures on offspring phenotype, known as intergenerational carryover effects. Parental exposure may deliver beneficial or detrimental characteristics to offspring that can influence larval recruitment patterns, thus shaping how populations and community structure respond to ocean change. Impacts of adult exposure to elevated winter temperature and pCO2 on reproduction and offspring viability were examined in the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) using three populations of adult, hatchery-reared O. lurida, plus an additional cohort spawned from one of the populations. Oysters were sequentially exposed to elevated temperature (+4{degrees}C, at 10{degrees}C), followed by elevated pCO2 (+2204 {micro}atm, at 3045 {micro}atm) during winter months. Male gametes were more developed after elevated temperature exposure and less developed after high pCO2 exposure, but there was no impact on female gametes or sex ratios. Oysters previously exposed to elevated winter temperature released larvae earlier, regardless of pCO2 exposure. Those exposed to elevated winter temperature as a sole treatment released more larvae on a daily basis, but when also exposed to high pCO2 there was no effect. These combined results indicate that elevated winter temperature accelerates O. lurida spermatogenesis, resulting in earlier larval release and increased production, with elevated pCO2 exposure negating effects of elevated temperature. Altered recruitment patterns may therefore follow warmer winters due to precocious spawning, but these effects may be masked by coincidental high pCO2. Offspring were reared in common conditions for one year, then deployed for three months in four estuarine bays with distinct environmental conditions. Offspring of parents exposed to elevated pCO2 had higher survival rates in two of the four bays. This carryover effect demonstrates that parental conditions can have substantial ecologically relevant impacts that should be considered when predicting impacts of environmental change. Furthermore, Olympia oysters may be more resilient in certain environments when progenitors are pre-conditioned in stressful conditions. Combined with other recent studies, our work suggests that the Olympia may be more equipped than other oysters for the challenge of a changing ocean.",

All resulting metal ion-centric regions were evaluated with respect to four quality-control criteria involving electron density resolution, atom occupancy, symmetry atom exclusion, and regional electron density discrepancy. The resulting list of metal binding sites passing all four criteria possess high regional structural quality and should be beneficial to a wide variety of downstream analyses. This study demonstrates an approach for the pan-PDB evaluation of metal binding site structural quality with respect to underlying x-ray crystallographic experimental data represented in available electron density maps of proteins. For non-crystallographers in particular, we hope to change the focus and discussion of structural quality from a global evaluation to a regional evaluation, since all structural entries in the wwPDB appear to have both regions of high and low structural quality.",

    "abstract": "Individuals differ widely in their contribution to the spread of infection within and across populations. Three key epidemiological host traits affect infectious disease spread: susceptibility (propensity to acquire infection), infectivity (propensity to transmit infection to others) and recoverability (propensity to recover quickly). Interventions aiming to reduce disease spread may target improvement in any one of these traits, but the necessary statistical methods for obtaining risk estimates are lacking. In this paper we introduce a novel software tool called SIRE (standing for \"Susceptibility, Infectivity and Recoverability Estimation\"), which allows simultaneous estimation of the genetic effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), as well as non-genetic influences on these three unobservable host traits. SIRE implements a flexible Bayesian algorithm which accommodates a wide range of disease surveillance data comprising any combination of recorded individual infection and/or recovery times, or disease status measurements. Different genetic and non-genetic regulations and data scenarios (representing realistic recording schemes) were simulated to validate SIRE and to assess their impact on the precision, accuracy and bias of parameter estimates. This analysis revealed that with few exceptions, SIRE provides unbiased, accurate parameter estimates associated with all three host traits. For most scenarios, SNP effects associated with recoverability can be estimated with highest precision, followed by susceptibility. For infectivity, many epidemics with few individuals give substantially more statistical power to identify SNP effects than the reverse. Importantly, precise estimates of SNP and other effects could be obtained even in the case of incomplete, censored and relatively infrequent measurements of individuals infection or survival status, albeit requiring more individuals to yield equivalent precision. SIRE represents a new tool for analysing a wide range of experimental and field disease data with the aim of discovering and validating SNPs and other factors controlling infectious disease transmission.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the red blood cells, resulting in multiple acute and chronic complications including pain episodes, stroke, and kidney disease. Patients with SCD develop chronic organ dysfunction, which may progress to organ failure during disease exacerbations. Early detection of acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure is not always attainable. Machine learning techniques that allow for prediction of organ failure may enable earlier identification and treatment, and potentially reduce mortality. We tested the hypothesis that machine learning physiomarkers could predict the development of organ dysfunction in an adult sample of patients with SCD admitted to intensive care units.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe studied 63 sequential SCD patients with 163 patient encounters, mean age 33.0{+/-}11.0 years, admitted to intensive care units, some of whom (6.7%) had pre-existing cardiovascular or kidney disease. A subset of these patient encounters (37; 23%) met sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) criteria. The site of organ failure included: central nervous system (32), cardiovascular (11), renal (10), liver (7), respiratory (5) and coagulation (2) systems. Most (81.5%) of the patient encounters who experienced organ failure had single organ failure. The other 126 SCD patient encounters served as controls. A set of signal processing features (such as fast fourier transform, energy, continuous wavelet transform, etc.) derived from heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were identified to distinguish patients with SCD who developed acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure, from SCD patients who did not meet the criteria. A random forest model accurately predicted organ failure up to six hours prior to onset, with a five-fold cross-validation accuracy of 94.57% (average sensitivity and specificity of 90.24% and 98.9% respectively).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the viability of using machine learning to predict acute physiological deterioration heralded organ failure among hospitalized adults with SCD. The discovery of salient physiomarkers through machine learning techniques has the potential to further accelerate the development and implementation of innovative care delivery protocols and strategies for medically vulnerable patients.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant matrix turnover with elevated matrix proteolysis is a hallmark of tendon pathology. While tendon disease mechanisms remain obscure, mechanical cues are central regulators. Unloading of tendon explants in standard culture conditions provokes rapid cell-mediated tissue breakdown. Here we show that biological response to tissue unloading depends on the mimicked physiological context. Our experiments reveal that explanted tendon tissues remain functionally stable in a simulated avascular niche of low temperature and oxygen, regardless of the presence of serum. This hyperthermic and hyperoxic niche-dependent catabolic switch was shown by whole transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) to be a strong pathological driver of an immune-modulatory phenotype, with a stress response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and associated activation of catabolic extracellular matrix proteolysis that involved lysosomal activation and transcription of a range of proteolytic enzymes. Secretomic and degradomic analysis through terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) confirmed that proteolytic activity in unloaded tissues was strongly niche dependent. Through targeted pharmacological inhibition we isolated ROS mediated oxidative stress as a major checkpoint for matrix proteolysis. We conclude from these data that the tendon stromal compartment responds to traumatic mechanical unloading in a manner that is highly dependent on the extrinsic niche, with oxidative stress response gating the proteolytic breakdown of the functional collagen backbone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInvasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a clinically and molecularly distinct disease. Tumour microenvironment (TME) immune phenotypes play crucial roles in predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic efficacy.\\n\\nMethodIn this study, we depict the immune landscape of IDC by using transcriptome profiling and clinical characteristics retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Immune cell infiltration was evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) analysis and systematically correlated with genomic characteristics and clinicopathological features of IDC patients. Furthermore, an immune signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. A random forest algorithm was applied to identify the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed immune signature. A nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the immune signature to predict survival probability was constructed by multivariate Cox regression.\\n\\nResultsThe IDC were clustered into low immune infiltration, intermediate immune infiltration, and high immune infiltration by the immune landscape. The high infiltration group had a favourable survival probability compared with that of the low infiltration group. The low-risk score subtype identified by the immune signature was characterized by T cell-mediated immune activation. Additionally, activation of the interferon- response, interferon-{gamma} response and TNF- signalling via the NF{kappa}B pathway was observed in the low-risk score subtype, which indicated T cell activation and may be responsible for significantly favourable outcomes in IDC patients. A random forest algorithm identified the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed immune signature. Furthermore, a nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the immune signature to predict survival probability was constructed, revealing that the immune signature was an independent prognostic biomarker. Finally, the relationship of VEGFA, PD1, PDL-1 and CTLA-4 expression with the immune infiltration landscape and the immune signature was analysed to interpret the responses of IDC patients to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\\n\\nConclusionTaken together, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the immune landscape of IDC and constructed an immune signature related to the immune landscape. This analysis of TME immune infiltration patterns has shed light on how IDC respond to immune checkpoint therapy and may guide the development of novel drug combination strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKnowledge of traditional plant use in rural communities is under threat from urbanization and also land use change. Hence, elucidating region-specific patterns traditional knowledge of habitat resource use is crucial for assisting policy making with regard to nature conservation, human nutrition, and human health. Using original data from northeast Bahia, Brazil, we aim to document the collective knowledge of plant use possessed by artisanal fishermen and women in fishing communities, related to medicinal, construction, technology and ritualistic/religious uses.\\n\\nMethodsData were collected through interviews with and opportunistic guided tours by local specialists to record the local knowledge of plant use and methods of use.\\n\\nResultsThrough interviews, 116 species of plants from 104 genera and 47 botanical families were identified along with their local names, plant parts utilized, habitats, and preparation methods, and an additional 26 spp. for which only local names were available. Of these, 72 spp. are used as medicine, 48 spp. as non-conventional edibles, 31 spp. for construction and 11 for religious/mystical purposes. Female informants generally cited more food and medicinal plants than male informants. All interviewees unanimously expressed that the use of plants for medicines and fishing technology has significantly reduced or been superseded by modern materials.\\n\\nConclusionThe present study demonstrates that the rich collective plant use knowledge of an artisanal fishing community in northeast Brazil. The results of this study serves as a framework for to extend ethnobotanical investigations to other traditional fishing communities in the vicinity, and also to examine more social and demographic factors influencing traditional knowledge related to uses of plants. Finally, the rich tradition of plant use in the region underpins the need to encourage measures to preserve this cultural knowledge and conserve the natural environments that are a source of these plants.",

    "abstract": "Profile-QSAR (pQSAR) is a massively multi-task, 2-step machine learning method with unprecedented scope, accuracy and applicability domain. In step one, a \\\"profile\\\" of conventional single-assay random forest regression (RFR) models are trained on a very large number of biochemical and cellular pIC50 assays using Morgan 2 sub-structural fingerprints as compound descriptors. In step two, a panel of PLS models are built using the profile of pIC50 predictions from those RFR models as compound descriptors. Hence the name. Previously described for a panel of 728 biochemical and cellular kinase assays, we have now built an enormous pQSAR from 11,805 diverse Novartis IC50 and EC50 assays. This large number of assays, and hence of compound descriptors for PLS, dictated reducing the profile by only including RFR models whose predictions correlate with the assay being modeled. The RFR and pQSAR models were evaluated with our \\\"realistically novel\\\" held-out test set whose median average similarity to the nearest training set member across the 11,805 assays was only 0.34, thus testing a realistically large applicability domain. For the 11,805 single-assay RFR models, the median correlation of prediction with experiment was only R2 ext=0.05, virtually random, and only 8% of the models achieved our standard success threshold of R2 ext=0.30. For pQSAR, the median correlation was R2 ext=0.53, comparable to 4-concentration experimental IC50s, and 72% of the models met our R2 ext>0.30 standard, totaling 8558 successful models. The successful models included assays from all of the 51 annotated target sub-classes, as well as 4196 phenotypic assays, indicating that pQSAR can be applied to virtually any disease area. Every month, all models are updated to include new measurements, and predictions are made for 5.5 million Novartis compounds, totaling 50 billion predictions. Common uses have included virtual screening, selectivity design, toxicity and promiscuity prediction, mechanism-of-action prediction, and others.",

    "abstract": "The metabotropic gamma-amino-butyric acid B receptor (GABABR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates neuronal inhibition by the neurotransmitter GABA. Here, we identified putative GABAB receptors and signaling modulators in the basal sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Activation of GABABR signaling reversibly arrests planula-to-polyp transformation during early development and affects the neurogenic program. We identified four Nematostella GABABR homologs that have the conserved 3D extracellular domains and residues needed for binding of GABA and the GABABR agonist baclofen. Transcriptomic analysis, combined with spatial analysis of baclofen-treated planulae, revealed that baclofen down-regulated pro-neural factors such as NvSoxB(2), NvNeuroD1 and NvElav1. Baclofen also inhibited neuron development and extended neurites, resulting in an under-developed and less organized nervous system. Our results shed light on cnidarian development and suggest an evolutionarily conserved function for GABABR in regulation of neurogenesis, highlighting Nematostella as a new model system to study GABABR signaling.",

    "abstract": "Carboxyl (C)-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) participate in protective and regulatory proteolysis in bacteria. The PDZ domain is central to the activity of CTPs but plays inherently different regulatory roles. For example, the PDZ domain inhibits the activity of the signaling protease CtpB by blocking the active site but is required for the activation of Prc (or Tsp), a tail-specific protease that degrades the ssrA-tagged proteins. Here, by structural and functional analysis we show that in the unliganded resting state of Prc, the PDZ domain is docked inside the bowl-shaped scaffold without contacting the active site, which is kept in a default misaligned conformation. In Prc, a hydrophobic substrate sensor distinct from CtpB engages substrate binding to the PDZ domain and triggers a structural remodeling to align the active site residues. Therefore, this work reveals the structural basis for understanding the contrasting roles of the PDZ domain in the regulation of CTPs.",

    "abstract": "Cohesive interactions between cells play an integral role in development, differentiation, and regeneration. Existing methods for controlling cell-cell cohesion by manipulating protein expression are constrained by biological interdependencies, e.g. coupling of cadherins to actomyosin force-feedback mechanisms. We use oligonucleotides conjugated to PEGylated lipid anchors (ssDNAPEGDPPE) to introduce artificial cell-cell cohesion that is largely decoupled from the internal cytoskeleton. We describe cell-cell doublets with a mechanical model based on isotropic, elastic deformation of spheres to estimate the cohesion at the cell-cell interface. Physical manipulation of cohesion by modulating PEG-lipid to ssDNAPEGDPPE ratio, and conversely treatment with actin-depolymerizing cytochalsin-D, resulted respectively in decreases and increases in doublet contact area. Our data are relevant to the ongoing discussion over mechanisms of tissue surface tension and in agreement with models based on opposing cortical and cohesive forces. PEG-lipid modulation of doublet geometries resulted in a well-defined curve indicating continuity, enabling prescriptive calibration for controlling doublet geometry. Our study demonstrates tuning of basic doublet cohesion, laying the foundation for more complex multicellular cohesion control independent of protein expression.",

By using the inverse mitotic index (the ratio of mononuclear to binuclear cells) to adjust the micronucleus yield we were able to obtain a monotonic increasing dose response curve at doses of up to at least 10 Gy from the same samples which generated dose-response curve with a peak near 6 Gy, when scored using the traditional micronucleus yield.",
