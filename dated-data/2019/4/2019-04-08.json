    "abstract": "MotivationConvolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely used in functional motifs identification for large-scale DNA/RNA sequences. Currently, however, the only way to interpret such a convolutional kernel is a heuristic construction of a position weight matrix (PWM) from fragments scored highly by that kernel.\\n\\nResultsInstead of using heuristics, we developed a novel, exact kernel-to-PWM transformation whose equivalency is theoretically proven: the log-likelihood of the resulting PWM generating any DNA/RNA sequence is exactly the sum of a constant and the convolution of the original kernel on the same sequence. Importantly, we further proved that the resulting PWMs performance on sequence classification/regression can be exactly the same as the original kernels under popular CNN frame-works. In simulation, the exact transformation rivals or outperforms the heuristic PWMs in terms of classifying sequences with sequence- or structure-motifs. The exact transformation also faithfully reproduces the output of CNN models on real-world cases, while the heuristic one fails, especially on the case with little prior knowledge on the form of underlying true motifs. Of note, the time complexity of the novel exact transformation is independent on the number of input sequences, enabling it to scale well for massive training sequences.\\n\\nAvailabilityPython scripts for the transformation from kernel to PWM, the inverted transformation from PWM to kernel, and a proof-of-concept for the maximum likelihood estimation of optimal PWM are available through https://github.com/gao-lab/kernel-to-PWM.\\n\\nContactgaog@mail.cbi.pku.edu.cn",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvaluation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) ratios in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems can advance our understanding of biological processes, nutrient cycling and the fate of organic matter (OM) in aquatic ecosystems. Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems can disrupt the accumulation and decomposition of OM which serves as the base of the aquatic food web, and is central to the effectiveness of a treatment wetland. This study investigated nutrient stoichiometry within and between wetland ecosystem compartments (i.e. water column, vegetation, flocculent and soil) of two treatment flow-ways (FWs) in the Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas located in south Florida (USA). These FWs include an emergent aquatic vegetation cell dominated by Typha spp.(cattail) and a submerged aquatic vegetation cell composed of species such as Chara spp. (muskgrass) and Potamogeton spp. (pondweed). The primary objective of this evaluation was to determine if nutrient stoichiometry is consistent within and between ecosystems and compartments to understand biogeochemical cycling and controls of nutrient removal within a treatment wetland ecosystem.\\n\\nResultsThis study demonstrates that C, N, and P stoichiometry can be highly variable among ecosystem compartments and between differing wetland ecosystems. Generally, total P declined along the length of each treatment FW in all ecosystem compartments, whereas trends in total N and C trends were more variable. These changes in C and nutrient concentrations result in variable nutrient stoichiometry along treatment FWs signaling potential changes in absolute and relative nutrient availability and biogeochemical processes.\\n\\nConclusionsAssessment of wetland nutrient stoichiometry between and within ecosystem compartments suggest decoupling of C:N:P relationships likely as a consequence of differential external nutrient supply, differences in primary producer communities and differential decomposition of organic matter. However, stoichiometry varies often monotonous along the flow paths, likely exhibiting a response to nutrient loading. Differences in C:N:P ratios in primary producers, light availability, microbial immobilization in the early stage of decomposition as well as nutrient mining during decomposition of OM are likely feedback mechanisms that lead to deviations from fixed stoichiometry, which in turn may have considerable influence on nutrient removal rates. This information could be used to further understand water treatment performance with respect to stoichiometric processes and OM decomposition.",

    "abstract": "The BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein is involved in the maintenance of genome integrity through its role in homologous recombination. In mitosis, BRCA2 is phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Here we describe how this phosphorylation contributes to the control of mitosis. We identified two highly conserved phosphorylation sites at S193 and T207 of BRCA2. Phosphorylated-T207 is a bona fide docking site for PLK1 as illustrated by the crystal structure of the BRCA2 peptide bound to PLK1 Polo-box domain. We found that BRCA2 bound to PLK1 forms a complex with the phosphatase PP2A and phosphorylated-BUBR1. Reducing BRCA2 binding to PLK1, as observed in BRCA2 breast cancer variants S206C and T207A, alters the tetrameric complex resulting in misaligned chromosomes, faulty chromosome segregation and aneuploidy. We thus reveal a direct role of BRCA2 in the alignment of chromosomes, distinct from its DNA repair function, with important consequences on chromosome stability. These findings may explain in part the aneuploidy observed in BRCA2-mutated tumors.",

    "abstract": "Regulators of chromatin dynamics and transcription are increasingly implicated in the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Haploinsufficiency of EHMT1, encoding a histone methyl-transferase, is associated with several NDDs, including Kleefstra syndrome, developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Using a mouse model of Ehmt1 haploinsufficiency (Ehmt1D6Cre/+), we examined a number of brain and behavioural endophenotypes of relevance to NDDs. Specifically, we show that Ehmt1D6Cre/+ mice have deficits in information processing, evidenced by abnormal sensory-motor gating, a complete absence of object recognition memory and a reduced magnitude of auditory evoked potentials in both paired-pulse inhibition and mismatch negativity (MMN). The electrophysiological experiments show that differences in magnitude response to auditory stimulus were associated with marked reductions in total and evoked beta- and gamma-band oscillatory activity, as well as significant reductions in phase synchronisation. The pattern of electrophysiological deficits in Ehmt1D6Cre/+ matches those seen in control mice following administration of the selective NMDA-R antagonist, ketamine. This, coupled with reduction of Grin1 mRNA expression in Ehmt1D6Cre/+ hippocampus, suggests that Ehmt1 haploinsufficiency may lead to disruption in NMDA-R. Taken together, these data indicate that reduced Ehmt1 dosage during forebrain development leads to abnormal circuitry formation, which in turn results in profound information processing deficits. Such information processing deficits are likely paramount to our understanding of the cognitive and neurological dysfunctions shared across the NDDs associated with EHMT1 haploinsufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Originality-significance statementIncreased incidence of food-borne disease outbreaks caused by fresh produce contaminated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. has prompted researchers to examine the interaction between these bacteria and various plant species under different environmental conditions. Although studies show that human enteropathogenic bacteria survive both on the surface of and inside plants, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying plant invasion and colonization. Here, we examined the interaction between the human pathogenic bacterium Shigella and the model plant Arabidopsis. We found that four Shigella spp. strains proliferated successfully in Arabidopsis, causing symptom-like lesions in tissues. Using mutants lacking T3S effectors (i.e., noninvasive human strains), we demonstrated that effectors regulating pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in bacteria-plant interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine Shigella-mediated virulence and host immune suppression in a plant host at a molecular level.\\n\\nSummaryAlthough there is debate about whether human intestinal pathogenic bacteria are also plant pathogens, it is clear that these bacteria use plants as an alternative host. Shigella, which infects primates, is reportedly transmitted by fresh vegetables; however, its molecular interactions with plants have not been extensively studied. Here, we show that four Shigella strains, S. boydii (S. b), S. sonnei (S. s), S. flexneri 2a (S. f 2a), and S. flexneri 5a (S. f 5a), proliferated at different levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. Microscopic studies revealed that these bacteria were present inside leaves and damaged plant cells. GFP-labeled S. b, S. f 2a, and S. f 5a entered plants via guard cells, and S. f 2a infiltrated root tissues and colonized roots. Using mutants lacking type III secretion systems (T3SS), we found that T3SS of Shigella that regulate the pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in attachment and multiplication in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive activity of two T3S effectors, OspF and OspG, were needed for the proliferation of Shigella in Arabidopsis. These findings demonstrate that Shigella-mediated virulence determinants are expressed, and pathogenic symptoms are observed, in model plants.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing has led to the discovery of many transcript isoforms created by alternative splicing, but the translational status and functional significance of most alternative splicing events remain unknown. Here we applied a splice junction-centric approach to survey the landscape of protein alternative isoform expression in the human proteome. We focused on alternative splice events where pairs of splice junctions corresponding to included and excluded exons with appreciable read counts are translated together into selective protein sequence databases. Using this approach, we constructed tissue-specific FASTA databases from ENCODE RNA sequencing data, then reanalyzed splice junction peptides in existing mass spectrometry datasets across 10 human tissues (heart, lung, liver, pancreas, ovary, testis, colon, prostate, adrenal gland, and esophagus). Our analysis reidentified 1,108 non-canonical isoforms annotated in SwissProt. We further found 253 novel splice junction peptides in 212 genes that are not documented in the comprehensive Uniprot TrEMBL or Ensembl RefSeq databases. On a proteome scale, non-canonical isoforms differ from canonical sequences preferentially at sequences with heightened protein disorder, suggesting a functional consequence of alternative splicing on the proteome is the regulation of intrinsically disordered regions. We further observed examples where isoform-specific regions intersect with important cardiac protein phosphorylation sites. Our results reveal previously unidentified protein isoforms and may avail efforts to elucidate the functions of splicing events and expand the pool of observable biomarkers in profiling studies.\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations",

    "abstract": "We conducted a comparative analysis of primate cerebral size and neocortical folding using magnetic resonance imaging data from 65 individuals belonging to 34 different species. We measured several neocortical folding parameters and studied their evolution using phylogenetic comparative methods. Our results suggest that the most likely model for neuroanatomical evolution is one where differences appear randomly (the Brownian Motion model), however, alternative models cannot be completely ruled out. We present estimations of the ancestral primate phenotypes as well as estimations of the rates of phenotypic change. Based on the Brownian Motion model, the common ancestor of primates may have had a folded cerebrum similar to that of a small lemur such as the aye-aye. Finally, we observed a non-linear relationship between fold wavelength and fold depth with cerebral volume. In particular, gyrencephalic primate neocortices across different groups exhibited a strikingly stable fold wavelength of about 12 mm ({+/-} 20%), despite a 20-fold variation in cerebral volume. We discuss our results in the context of current theories of neocortical folding.",

    "abstract": "Statistical analysis plays a significant role in both protein sequences and structures, expanding in recent years from the studies of co-evolution guided single-site mutations to protein folding in silico. Here we describe a computational tool, termed Sibe, with a particular focus on protein sequence analysis, folding and design. Since Sibe has various easy-interface modules, expressive architecture and extensible codes, it is powerful in statistically analyzing sequence data and building energetic potentials in boosting both protein folding and design. In this study, Sibe is used to capture positionally conserved couplings between pairwise amino acids and help rational protein design, in which the pairwise couplings are filtered according to the relative entropy computed from the positional conservations and grouped into several  blocks. A human {beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) was used to demonstrated that those  blocks could contribute rational design at functional residues. In addition, Sibe provides protein folding modules based on both the positionally conserved couplings and well-established statistical potentials. Sibe provides various easy to use command-line interfaces in C++ and/or Python. Sibe was developed for compatibility with the  big data era, and it primarily focuses on protein sequence analysis, in silico folding and design, but it is also applicable to extend for other modeling and predictions of experimental measurements.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in targeted drugs and immunotherapy, cancer remains \\\"the emperor of all maladies\\\" due to inevitable emergence of resistance. Drug resistance is thought to be driven by mutations and/or dynamic plasticity that deregulate pathway activities and regulatory programs of a highly heterogeneous tumour. In this study, we propose a modelling framework to simulate population dynamics of heterogeneous tumour cells with reversible drug resistance. Drug sensitivity of a tumour cell is determined by its internal states, which are demarcated by coordinated activities of multiple interconnected oncogenic pathways. Transitions between cellular states depend on the effects of targeted drugs and regulatory relations between the pathways. Under this framework, we build a simple model to capture drug resistance characteristics of BRAF-mutant melanoma, where two cell states are described by two mutually inhibitory - main and alternative - pathways. We assume that cells with an activated main pathway are proliferative yet sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor, and cells with an activated alternative pathway are quiescent but resistant to the drug. We describe a dynamical process of tumour growth under various drug regimens using the explicit solution of mean-field equations. Based on these solutions, we compare efficacy of three treatment strategies: static treatments with continuous and constant dosages, periodic treatments with regular intermittent phases and drug holidays, and treatments derived from optimal control theory (OCT). Based on these analysis, periodic treatments outperform static treatments with a considerable margin, while treatments based on OCT outperform the best periodic treatment. Our results provide insights regarding optimal cancer treatment modalities for heterogeneous tumours, and may guide the development of optimal therapeutic strategies to circumvent drug resistance and due to tumour plasticity.",

Intriguingly, a substantial behavioral literature suggests that naive human reasoners, adults and children, are tacitly sensitive to causal confounding. Here, a combination of fMRI and cognitive computational modeling was used to investigate neural substrates mediating such sensitivity. While being scanned, participants observed and judged the influences of various putative causes with confounded or non-confounded, deterministic or stochastic, influences. During judgments requiring generalization of causal knowledge from a feedback-based learning context to a transfer probe, activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) was better accounted for by a Bayesian causal model, sensitive to both confounding and stochasticity, than a purely error-driven algorithm, sensitive only to stochasticity. Implications for the detection and estimation of distinct forms of uncertainty, and for a neural mediation of domain general constraints on causal induction, are discussed.",

However, gene expression plasticity provides the potential for organisms to respond rapidly and effectively to environmental changes, and would be favored in variable environments. In this study, we investigated the thermal stress response in Pocillopora coral colonies from two contrasting environments by exposing them to heat stress. We compared the physiological state, bacterial and Symbionaceae communities (using 16S and ITS2 metabarcoding), and gene expression levels (using RNA-Seq) between control conditions and heat stress (the temperature just below the first signs of compromised health). Colonies from both thermal regimes remained apparently normal and presented open and colored polyps during heat stress, with no change in bacterial and Symbionaceae community composition. In contrast, they differed in their transcriptomic responses. The colonies from Oman displayed a more plastic transcriptome, but some genes had a higher basal expression level (frontloading) compared to the less thermotolerant colonies from New Caledonia. In terms of biological functions, we observed an increase in the expression of stress response genes (including induction of tumor necrosis factor receptors, heat shock proteins, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species), together with a decrease in the expression of genes involved in morpho-anatomical functions. Gene regulation (transcription factors, mobile elements, histone modifications and DNA methylation) appeared to be overrepresented in the Oman colonies, indicating possible epigenetic regulation. These results show that transcriptomic plasticity and frontloading can be co-occurring processes in corals confronted to highly variable thermal regimes.",

    "abstract": "Over a decade ago, a new discipline called network medicine emerged as an approach to understand human diseases from a network theory point-of-view. Disease networks proved to be an intuitive and powerful way to reveal hidden connections among apparently unconnected biomedical entities such as diseases, physiological processes, signaling pathways, and genes. One of the fields that has benefited most from this improvement is the identification of new opportunities for the use of old drugs, known as drug repurposing. The importance of drug repurposing lies in the high costs and the prolonged time from target selection to regulatory approval of traditional drug development. In this document we analyze the evolution of disease network concept during the last decade and apply a data science pipeline approach to evaluate their functional units. As a result of this analysis, we obtain a list of the most commonly used functional units and the challenges that remain to be solved. This information can be very valuable for the generation of new prediction models based on disease networks.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of community ecology is to infer biotic interactions from observed distributions of co-occurring species. Evidence for biotic interactions, however, can be obscured by shared environmental requirements, posing a challenge for statistical inference. Here we introduce a dynamic statistical model that quantifies the effects of spatial and temporal covariance in longitudinal co-occurrence data. We separate the fixed pairwise effects of species occurrences on persistence and colonization rates, a potential signal of direct interactions, from latent pairwise correlations in occurrence, a potential signal of shared environmental responses. We apply our modeling approach to a pressing epidemiological question by examining how human papillomavirus (HPV) types coexist. Our results suggest that while HPV types respond similarly to common host traits, direct interactions are sparse and weak, so that HPV type diversity depends largely on shared environmental drivers. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to microbial communities and provides valuable insights that should lead to more directed hypothesis testing and mechanistic modeling.",

Drug repositioning, i.e. finding new uses for existing drugs, is a promising alternative; yet, its effectiveness has hitherto been hindered by our limited knowledge about diseases and their relationships. In this paper we present DISNET (Drug repositioning and disease understanding through complex networks creation and analysis), a web-based system designed to extract knowledge from signs and symptoms retrieved from medical data bases, and to enable the creation of customisable disease networks. We here present the main functionalities of the DISNET system. We describe how information on diseases and their phenotypic manifestations is extracted from Wikipedia, PubMed and MayoClinic; specifically, texts from these sources are processed through a combination of text mining and natural language processing techniques. We further present a validation of the processing performed by the system; and describe, with some simple use cases, how a user can interact with it and extract information that could be used for subsequent analyses.\\n\\nDatabase URL: http://disnet.ctb.upm.es",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDivide-and-conquer methods, which divide the species set into over-lapping subsets, construct a tree on each subset, and then combine the subset trees using a supertree method, provide a key algorithmic framework for boosting the scalability of phylogeny estimation methods to large datasets. Yet the use of supertree methods, which typically attempt to solve NP-hard optimization problems, limits the scalability of such approaches.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach that does not require supertree estimation: we divide the species set into pairwise disjoint subsets, construct a tree on each subset using a base method, and then combine the subset trees using a distance matrix. For this merger step, we present a new method, called NJMerge, which is a polynomial-time extension of Neighbor Joining (NJ); thus, NJMerge can be viewed either as a method for improving traditional NJ or as a method for scaling the base method to larger datasets. We prove that NJMerge can be used to create divide-and-conquer pipelines that are statistically consistent under some models of evolution. We also report the results of an extensive simulation study evaluating NJMerge on multi-locus datasets with up to 1000 species. We found that NJMerge sometimes improved the accuracy of traditional NJ and substantially reduced the running time of three popular species tree methods (ASTRAL-III, SVDquartets, and \\\"concatenation\\\" using RAxML) without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, although NJMerge can fail to return a tree, in our experiments, NJMerge failed on only 11 out of 2560 test cases.\\n\\nConclusionsTheoretical and empirical results suggest that NJMerge is a valuable technique for large-scale phylogeny estimation, especially when computational resources are limited.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSexual segregation is common in many species and has been attributed to intra-specific competition, sex-specific differences in foraging efficiency or in activity budgets and habitat choice. However, very few studies have simultaneously quantified sex-specific foraging strategies, at sea distribution, habitat use, and trophic ecology. Moreover, these studies come from low latitude areas reflecting a lack of evidence for polar species. We investigated sexual segregation in snow petrels Pagodroma nivea and combined movement, foraging trip efficiency, stable isotope and oceanographic data to test whether sexual segregation results from sex-specific habitat use. Breeding birds foraging in the Dumont dUrville sea, Antarctica, were tracked during incubation. Some similarities between males and females foraging characteristics did not support the sexual segregation hypothesis. Indeed, space-use sharing and utilization distribution, {delta}13C values and foraging trip performances (trip duration, length, speed and directions, mass gain, proportion mass gain) were similar between males and females.. However, there was support for sexual segregation in foraging characteristics linked to foraging habitats. Females foraged less than males in areas with higher sea ice concentration (SIC >70%) and had lower {delta}15N values in plasma, blood cells and feathers. Foraging efficiency (proportionate daily mass gain while foraging), was greater for females than for males, and was greater for larger females with deeper bills. Females were more efficient than males during short (<2 days) foraging trips, and for females, but not for males, mass gain, proportion mass gain and body condition at return from a foraging trip were positively correlated to SIC of the foraging areas. Together, these results suggest an absence of sexual segregation at large spatial scales in snow petrels during incubation, but strongly support habitat segregation between high (>70%) more profitable SIC (males) and low SIC areas (females), probably driven by intraspecific competition. Therefore, male and female snow petrels segregate at small spatial scales mainly determined by habitat (SIC) characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Recent research efforts to identify genes involved in the susceptibility to P. falciparum malaria have focused on severe forms of malaria, with several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and multi-center analyses published this past decade. Here we present the first GWAS performed on mild malaria susceptibility in young children, designed to identify genetic variants involved in innate immunity or innate resistance mechanisms. Two cohorts of infants from southern Benin (525 and 250 individuals respectively), used as discovery and replication cohorts, were closely followed from birth to 18-24 months of age, with an assessment of a space-and time-dependent risk of exposure to vector bites. GWAS was performed on 15.5 million genotyped and imputed variants, with the susceptibility of infants to mild malaria attacks and to malaria infections as a whole (both symptomatic and asymptomatic). Infant susceptibility to malaria was assessed by considering all malaria events occurring during the follow-up using a Cox-model for recurrent events. We found strong statistical support for a role of PTPRT, a tyrosine phosphatase receptors involved in STAT3 pathway, with the protection against both mild malaria attacks and malaria infections (p=9.70x10-8 and p=1.78x10-7 respectively in the discovery cohort, and both p < 0.05 in the replication cohort). Furthermore, our study highlights several other genes, among them, UROC1, ACER3 and the PLAG2 cluster, whose biological functions are relevant in malaria infection. Results show that despite the difficulty of setting up such longitudinal field studies, GWAS on non-severe malaria can successfully identify new candidate genes and inform physiological mechanisms underlying natural protection against malaria.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMalaria remains a major worldwide public health problem with circa 219 million cases and 435,000 deaths per year. As for many infectious diseases, the genetics of the host plays a role in the disease course. So far, most studies on such genetic factors focused on severe malaria forms. Our study aimed to find factors associated with simple forms (asymptomatic forms and uncomplicated clinical forms). We used dense genome-wide data of two cohorts of infants closely followed during two years in Benin, and we incorporated an environmental risk of exposure estimated at individual level from entomological, climatic, and environmental data. This allowed us to unravel several genes that appear to play a role in the susceptibility to malaria infection, thus demonstrating the feasibility of a genome-wide approach on non-severe forms. Functional studies are needed to confirm the role of the genetic factors highlighted here. Some of these genes represent interesting targets for future prevention strategies and drug development.",

We report cell-autonomous defects in proliferation, cell cycle, and survival, accompanied by early NSPC maturation in several KMT2D-deficient model systems. Transcriptional suppression in KMT2D-deficient cells indicated strong perturbation of hypoxia-responsive metabolism pathways. Functional experiments confirmed abnormalities of cellular hypoxia responses in KMT2D-deficient neural cells, and accelerated NSPC maturation in vivo.

    "abstract": "Intestinal crypts are responsible for the total cell renewal of the lining of the intestines, occurring every 4-7 days in humans. This rapid turnover is governed by the complex interplay between signalling pathways and the cell cycle within individual cells in the crypts. The role of Wnt signalling in governing cell proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal crypt has been extensively studied, with increased signalling found towards the lower regions of the crypt. Recent studies have shown that the Wnt signalling gradient found within the crypt may arise as a result of division-based spreading from a Wnt  reservoir at the crypt base. The discovery of the Hippo pathways involvement in maintaining crypt homeostasis is more recent; a mechanistic understanding of Hippo pathway dynamics, and its possible cross-talk with the Wnt pathway, remains lacking. To explore how the interplay between these pathways may control crypt homeostasis and dysplasia we developed and analysed a mathematical model coupling an ordinary differential equation description of Wnt and Hippo signalling with a cell-based description of cell movement, proliferation and contact inhibition. Furthermore, we compared an imposed Wnt gradient with a division-based Wnt gradient model. Our results suggest that Hippo signalling affects the Wnt pathway by reducing the presence of free cytoplasmic {beta}-catenin, causing cell cycle arrest. This process slows the rate of crypt turnover, previously attributed only to mutations in Wnt pathway components commonly observed in colorectal cancers. We also show that a division-based spreading of Wnt can form a Wnt gradient, resulting in proliferative dynamics comparable to imposed-gradient models. This suggests that imposed-gradient models are a reasonable approximation of experimentally observed Wnt gradients, however they provide little insight into the source of Wnt. Finally, a simulated APC double mutant, with misregulated Wnt and Hippo signalling activity, is predicted to be capable of completing a more rapid monoclonal conversion of the crypt than a Wnt-only mutant.\\n\\nAuthor summaryColorectal cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It is generally established that colorectal cancer occurs upon disruption of the dynamics of crypts, tubular indentations lining the walls of the gastrointestinal tract that are responsible for renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate intestinal crypt dynamics is instrumental to understand how colorectal cancer can emerge. We used mathematical modelling to explore how crypt dynamics emerge from the interactions across several biological scales, including mutations that cause an abnormal cell response to changes at the cell or tissue level, cell proliferation and motility within the crypt. Our model describes, in each cell within the crypt, levels and dynamics of genes involved in two signalling pathways - the canonical Wnt and Hippo pathways - relevant for cell proliferation and adhesion. In simulations, we predict how the crosstalk between these pathways affects crypt dynamics in both healthy and dysplastic cases. Furthermore, our simulations match recent biological evidence of a novel mechanism, based on cell division, causing heterogeneous and graded localisation of different cell types (dividing or not) within the crypt. Our results suggest the possibility of combined disease treatment, targeting both the Wnt and Hippo pathways.",

    "abstract": "Free recall of random lists of words is a standard paradigm used to probe human memory. We proposed an associative search process that can be reduced to a deterministic walk on random graphs defined by the structure of memory representations. The corresponding graph model is different from the ones considered in the past but still can be solved analytically, resulting in a novel parameter-free prediction for the average number of memory items recalled (RC) out of M items in memory: [Formula]. This prediction was verified with a specially designed experimental protocol combining large-scale crowd-sourced free recall and recognition experiments with randomly assembled lists of words or common facts. Our theoretical and experimental results indicate that memory recall operates according to a stereotyped search process common to all people.",

    "abstract": "The most mineralized tissue of the mammalian body is tooth enamel. Especially in species with thick enamel, three-dimensional (3D) tomography data has shown that the distribution of enamel varies across the occlusal surface of the tooth crown. Differences in enamel thickness among species and within the tooth crown have been used to examine taxonomic affiliations, life history, and functional properties of teeth. Before becoming fully mineralized, enamel matrix is secreted on the top of a dentine template, and it remains to be explored how matrix thickness is spatially regulated. To provide a predictive framework to examine enamel distribution, we introduce a computational model of enamel matrix secretion that maps the dentine topography to the enamel surface topography. Starting from empirical enamel-dentine junctions, enamel matrix deposition is modeled as a diffusion-limited free boundary problem. Using laboratory microCT and synchrotron tomographic data of pig molars that have markedly different dentine and enamel surface topographies, we show how diffusion-limited matrix deposition accounts for both the process of matrix secretion and the final enamel distribution. Simulations reveal how concave and convex dentine features have distinct effects on enamel surface, thereby explaining why the enamel surface is not a straightforward extrapolation of the dentine template. Human molar simulations show that even subtle variation in dentine topography can be mapped to the enamel surface features. Mechanistic models of extracellular matrix deposition can be used to predict occlusal morphologies of teeth.",

    "abstract": "Controlling protein expression using a degron is drawing more attention because the protein of interest can be rapidly depleted in a reversible manner. We pioneered the development of the auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology by transplanting a plant-specific degradation pathway to non-plant cells. In human cells expressing an E3 ligase component, OsTIR1, it is possible to degrade a degron-fused protein with a half-life of 15-45 min in the presence of the phytohormone auxin. We reported previously the generation of human HCT116 mutants in which the C terminus of endogenous proteins was fused with the degron by CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in. Here, we show new plasmids for N-terminal tagging and describe a detailed protocol for the generation of AID mutants of human HCT116 and DLD1 cells. Moreover, we report the use of an OsTIR1 inhibitor, auxinole, to suppress leaky degradation of degron-fused proteins. The addition of auxinole is also useful for rapid re-expression after depletion of degron-fused proteins. These improvements enhance the utility of AID technology for studying protein function in living human cells.",

    "abstract": "GDE2 is a six-transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase with phospholipase D-like activity that cleaves select glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and thereby influences biological signaling cascades. GDE2 promotes neuronal differentiation cell-autonomously through glypican cleavage and is a prognostic marker in neuroblastoma, while GDE2 deficiency causes progressive neurodegeneration in mice and developmental defects in zebrafish. However, the regulation of GDE2 remains unclear. Here we show that in undifferentiated neuronal cells, GDE2 undergoes constitutive internalization and traffics back along both fast and slow recycling routes, while a small percentage is sorted to late endosomes. GDE2 trafficking is dictated by distinctive C-terminal tail sequences that determine secretion, endocytosis and recycling preference, respectively, and thereby regulate GDE2 function both positively and negatively. Our study reveals the sequence determinants of GDE2 trafficking and surface localization, and provides insight into the control of GPI-anchored protein activities with potential implications for nervous system disorders associated with impaired trafficking and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) consistently and universally extends health-and lifespan across taxa. Despite efforts to uncover the mechanisms underpinning DR - and ultimately translate its beneficial outcomes to humans - precise and universal mechanisms have not been identified. In biomedical science, the effects of DR are interpreted as regulating pro-longevity molecular pathways. This reasoning is guided by the conviction that DR evolved as an adaptive, pro-longevity physiological response to restricted food intake. Current evolutionary theory states that organisms should invest in their soma more heavily during periods of DR, and, when their resource availability improves, should outcompete age-matched rich-fed controls in survival and/or reproduction. Here we present a formal test of these key predictions utilising a large-scale demographic approach detailing mortality and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster fed alternating dietary regimes (N > 66,000 flies across 11 genetic lines). Our experiments reveal surprising and substantial mortality costs when returning to a rich diet after periods of DR. These results suggest the effects of DR are not necessarily intrinsically pro-longevity and could be considered an escape from costs incurred under nutrient-rich conditions, in addition to novel, discrete costs associated with restricting dietary protein. These insights question the relevance of current evolutionary explanations of DR in interpreting the mechanistic basis of dietary restriction.",

    "abstract": "Hyperthermia (HT) has shown feasibility and potency as an anticancer therapy. Administration of HT in the chemotherapy has previously enhanced the cytotoxicity of drugs against pancreatic cancer. However, the drugs used when conducting these studies are substantially conventional chemotherapeutic agents that may cause unwanted side effects. Additionally, the thermal dosage in the treatment of cancer cells could also probably harm the healthy cells. The purpose of this work was to investigate the potential of the two natural polyphenolic compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and chlorogenic acid (CGA), as heat synergizers in the thermal treatment of the PANC-1 cells. Furthermore, we have introduced a novel strategy entitled the thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) that is capable of providing a maximum synergy and minimal side effect with the anticancer compounds. Our results demonstrate that the combination of the TC-HT and the CGA or EGCG markedly exerts the anticancer effect against the PANC-1 cells, while none of the single treatment induced such changes. The synergistic activity was attributed to the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and the induction of the ROS-dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These findings not only represent the first thermal synergistic study of natural compounds in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but also highlight the potential application of the TC-HT as an alternative strategy in anticancer treatment.",

We developed an ambisense minigenome system for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) to dissect the effects of L gene mutations on viral transcription versus replication. The S RNA segment with regulatory elements for ambisense gene expression served as backbone for the minigenome. Expression of the luciferase reporter gene allowed the overall activity of the RVFV replication complex to be assessed, while northern blot analysis enabled differentiation between synthesis of viral mRNA and replication intermediates. The functionality of the system was demonstrated by probing residues predictably involved in the active site of the cap-snatching endonuclease in the N-terminus of the L protein. Corresponding mutations led to a selective defect in the viral mRNA synthesis as described for other viruses of the Bunyavirales order. The analysis of further L gene mutants revealed an essential and specific role of a C-terminal region in the RVFV L protein in viral transcription. In summary, the established minigenome system is suitable for functional testing of the relevance of residues for viral transcription and replication. It may be used to validate hypotheses arising from structural or biochemical investigations of the RVFV replication complex.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of infections caused by extraintestinal Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is rising globally, which is a major public health concern. ExPEC strains that are resistant to antimicrobials have been associated with excess mortality, prolonged hospital stays and higher healthcare costs. E. coli ST131 is a major ExPEC clonal group worldwide with variable plasmid composition, and has an array of genes enabling antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ST131 isolates frequently encode the AMR genes blaCTX-M-14/15/27, which are often rearranged, amplified and translocated by mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Short DNA reads do not fully resolve the architecture of repetitive elements on plasmids to allow MGE structures encoding blaCTX-M genes to be fully determined. Here, we performed long read sequencing to decipher the genome structures of six E. coli ST131 isolated from six patients. Most long read assemblies generated entire chromosomes and plasmids as single contigs, contrasting with more fragmented assemblies created with short reads alone. The long read assemblies highlighted diverse accessory genomes with blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-27 genes identified in three, one and one isolates, respectively. One sample had no blaCTX-M gene. Two samples had chromosomal blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-15 genes, and the latter was at three distinct locations, likely transposed by the adjacent MGEs: ISEcp1, IS903B and Tn2. This study showed that AMR genes exist in multiple different chromosomal and plasmid contexts even between closely-related isolates within a clonal group such as E. coli ST131.\n\nImportanceDrug-resistant bacteria are a major cause of illness worldwide and a specific subtype called Escherichia coli ST131 cause a significant amount of these infections. ST131 become resistant to treatment by modifying their DNA and by transferring genes among one another via large packages of genes called plasmids, like a game of pass-the-parcel. Tackling infections more effectively requires a better understanding of what plasmids are being exchanged and their exact contents. To achieve this, we applied new high-resolution DNA sequencing technology to six ST131 samples from infected patients and compared the output to an existing approach. A combination of methods shows that drug-resistance genes on plasmids are highly mobile because they can jump into ST131s chromosomes. We found that the plasmids are very elastic and undergo extensive rearrangements even in closely related samples. This application of DNA sequencing technologies illustrates at a new level the highly dynamic nature of ST131 genomes.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral serotonin (5-HT) exacerbates or limits inflammatory pathologies through interaction with seven types of 5-HT receptors (5-HT1-7). As central regulators of inflammation, macrophages are critical targets of 5-HT, which promotes their anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic polarization primarily via the 5-HT7-Protein Kinase A (PKA) axis. However, anti-inflammatory human macrophages are also characterized by the expression of 5-HT2B, an off-target of anesthetics, anti-parkinsonian drugs and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) that contributes to 5-HT-mediated pathologies. Since 5-HT2B prevents mononuclear phagocyte degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and modulates motility of murine microglial processes, we sought to determine the functional and transcriptional consequences of 5-HT2B activation in human macrophages. Ligation of 5-HT2B by the 5-HT2B-specific agonist BW723C86, which exhibits antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in animal models, significantly modified the cytokine profile and the transcriptional signature in macrophages. Importantly, 5-HT2B agonist-induced transcriptional changes were partly mediated through activation of the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates immune responses and the biological responses to xenobiotics. Besides, BW723C86 triggered transcriptional effects that could not be abrogated by 5-HT2B antagonists and impaired monocyte-to-osteoclast differentiation by affecting the expression of negative (IRF8) and positive (PRDM1) regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, our results demonstrate the existence of a functional 5-HT2B-AhR axis in human macrophages and indicate that the commonly used 5-HT2B agonist BW723C86 exhibits 5-HT2B-independent effects. The 5-HT2B-AhR link extends the range of signaling pathways initiated upon 5-HT receptor engagement and identifies a point of convergence for endogenous and exogenous agents with ability to modulate inflammatory responses.\\n\\nKEY POINTS- The serotonin receptor 5-HT2B modifies the human macrophage transcriptome through activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor.\\n- BW723C86, an agonist used for 5-HT2B activation in vivo, exerts 5-HT2B-independent effects and limits monocyte osteoclastogenic potential.",

    "abstract": "The olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae is a major pest of olives worldwide and houses a specialized gut microbiota dominated by the obligate symbiont \\\"Candidatus Erwinia dacicola\\\". Ca. E. dacicola is thought to supplement dietary nitrogen to the host, with only indirect evidence for this hypothesis so far. Here, we sought to investigate the contribution of the symbiosis to insect fitness and explore the ecology of the insect gut. For this purpose, we examined the composition of bacterial communities associated with Cretan olive fruit fly populations, and inspected several genome and transcriptome assemblies. We identified, and reconstructed the genome of, a novel component of the gut microbiota, Tatumella sp. TA1, which is stably associated with Mediterranean olive fruit fly populations. We also reconstructed a number of pathways related to nitrogen assimilation and interaction with the host. The results show that, despite variation in taxa composition of the gut microbial community, core functions related to the symbiosis are maintained. Functional redundancy between different microbial taxa was observed for genes allowing urea hydrolysis. The latter is encoded in the obligate symbiont genome by a conserved urease operon, likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer, based on phylogenetic evidence. A potential underlying mechanism is the action of mobile elements, especially abundant in the Ca. E. dacicola genome. This finding, along with the identification, in the studied genomes, of extracellular surface structure components that may mediate interactions within the gut community, suggest that ongoing and past genetic exchanges between microbes may have shaped the symbiosis.",

Moreover, we capture the dynamics of developmental BBB leakage using live imaging, revealing a combination of steady accumulation in the parenchyma and sporadic bursts of tracer leakage. Electron microscopy studies further reveal that this steady accumulation results from high levels of transcytosis that are eventually suppressed, sealing the BBB. Finally, we demonstrate a key mammalian BBB regulator Mfsd2a, which inhibits transcytosis, plays a conserved role in zebrafish. Mfsd2aa mutants display increased larval and adult BBB permeability due to increased transcytosis.

These ticks are frequently involved in the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis. While much more is known about I. ricinus tick-borne pathogen composition, information about temporal tick-borne pathogen patterns remain scarce. These data are crucial for predicting seasonal/annual patterns which could improve understanding and prevent tick-borne diseases.\n\nMethodsWe examined tick-borne pathogen (TBPs) dynamics in I. ricinus collected monthly in a peri-urban forest over three consecutive years. In total, 998 nymphs were screened for 31 pathogenic species using high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR.\n\nResultsWe detected DNA from Anaplasma phagocytophilum (5.3%), Rickettsia helvetica (4.5%), Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (3.7%), Borrelia miyamotoi (1.2%), Babesia venatorum (1.5%) and Rickettsia felis (0.1%). Among all analysed ticks, 15.9% were infected by at least one of these microorganisms, and 1.3% were co-infected. Co-infections with B. afzeli/B. garinii and B. garinii/B. spielmanii were significantly over-represented. Moreover, significant variations in seasonal and/or inter-annual prevalence were observed for several pathogens (R. helvetica, B. burgdorferi s.l., B. miyamotoi, and A. phagocytophilum).\n\nConclusionsAnalysing TBPs prevalence in monthly sampled tick over three years allowed us to assess seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations of the prevalence of TBPs known to circulate in the sampled area, but also to punctually detect less common species. All these data emphasize that sporadic tick samplings are not sufficient to determine TBPs prevalence and that regular monitoring is necessary.",

The protein product of FMR1, FMRP, is known as a translational repressor whose nuclear function is not understood. Here we report that FMRP is a genome maintenance protein. We show that FX cells exhibit elevated level of chromosome breaks, both spontaneous and replication stress-induced. We demonstrate that FMRP is required for abating R-loop accumulation, thereby preventing chromosome breakage. Through mapping FMRP-bound chromatin loci in normal cells and correlating with FX-specific chromosome breaks, we identified novel FXS-susceptible genes. We show that FX cells have reduced expression of the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1 family enzymes, suggesting defective xenobiotics glucuronidation and consequential neurotoxicity in FXS.",

Here, we report that Yes- associated protein (YAP), a central transcriptional regulator implicated in controlling organ and body size, modulates a Rho-GTPase switch that drives cellular migration by directly transactivating the Rac1-GEF protein TRIO. Additionally, YAP and TRIO activate the Rac1-STAT3 axis to promote invasive behavior. While we find this YAP-dependent infiltrative program in many cell types, it is particularly enhanced in a patient-specific way in the most common malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM), where hyperactivation of the YAP-mediated TRIO and STAT3 network also confers poor patient outcome and up-regulation of genes associated with the Mesenchymal subtype of GBM. Our analysis suggests that the YAP-TRIO-STAT3 signaling network identified in this study is a ubiquitous regulator of invasive cell spread in both normal and pathological contexts.",

However, basal cells are heterogenous and the stem cell subpopulation within basal cells is not well elucidated. Here we uncover that the core epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer Zeb is exclusively expressed in a prostate basal cell subpopulation based on both immunocytochemical and cell lineage tracing analysis. The Zeb1+ prostate epithelial cells are multipotent prostate basal stem cells (PBSCs) that can self-renew and generate functional prostatic glandular structures with all three epithelial cell types at the single-cell level. Genetic ablation studies reveal an indispensable role for Zeb1 in prostate basal cell development. Utilizing unbiased single cell transcriptomic analysis of over 9000 mouse prostate basal cells, we find that Zeb1+ basal cell subset shares gene expression signatures with both epithelial and mesenchymal cells and stands out uniquely among all the basal cell clusters. Moreover, Zeb1+ epithelial cells can be detected in mouse and clinical samples of prostate tumors. Identification of the PBSC and its transcriptome profile is crucial to advance our understanding of prostate development and tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "DNA-methylation is a crucial epigenetic mark for activity-dependent gene expression in neurons. Very little is known how synaptic signals impact promoter methylation in neuronal nuclei. In this study we show that protein levels of the principal de novo DNA-methyltransferase in neurons, DNMT3a1, are tightly controlled by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) containing the GluN2A subunit. Interestingly, synaptic NMDAR drive degradation of the methyltransferase in a neddylation-dependent manner. Inhibition of neddylation, the conjugation of the small ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to lysine residues, interrupts degradation of DNMT3a1 and results in deficits of promoter methylation of activity-dependent genes, synaptic plasticity as well as memory formation. In turn, the underlying molecular pathway is triggered by the induction of synaptic plasticity and in response to object location learning. Collectively the data show that GluN2A containing NMDAR control synapse-to-nucleus signaling that links plasticity-relevant signals to activity-dependent DNA-methylation involved in memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Hemagglutinin (HA) of Influenza virus is incorporated into cholesterol enriched, nanodomains of the plasma membrane. Phylogenetic group 2 HAs contain the conserved cholesterol consensus motif (CCM) YKLW in the transmembrane region. We previously reported that mutations in the CCM retarded intracellular transport of HA and decreased its nanodomain association. Here we analyzed whether cholesterol interacts with the CCM. Incorporation of photocholesterol into HA was significantly reduced if the whole CCM is replaced by alanine, both using immunoprecipitated HA and when HA is embedded in the membrane. Next, we used reverse genetics to investigate the significance of the CCM for virus replication. No virus was rescued if the whole motif is exchanged (YKLW4A); single (LA) or double (YK2A and LW2A) mutated virus showed decreased titers and a comparative fitness disadvantage. In polarized cells transport of HA mutants to the apical membrane was not disturbed. Reduced amounts of HA and cholesterol were incorporated into the viral membrane. Mutant viruses exhibit a decrease in hemolysis, which is only partially corrected if the membrane is replenished with cholesterol. More specifically, viruses have a defect in hemifusion as demonstrated by fluorescence dequenching. Cells expressing HA-YKLW4A fuse with erythrocytes, but the number of events are reduced. Even after acidification unfused erythrocytes remain cell-bound, a phenomenon not observed with wildtype HA. We conclude that cholesterol-binding to a group 2 HA is essential for virus replication. It has pleiotropic effects on virus assembly and membrane fusion, mainly on lipid mixing and possibly a preceding step.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is a major pathogenicity factor of Influenza viruses. Whereas the structure and function of HAs ectodomain is known in great detail, similar data for the membrane-anchoring part of the protein are missing. Here we demonstrate that the transmembrane region of a group 2 HA interacts with cholesterol, the major lipid of the plasma membrane and the defining element of the viral budding site nanodomains of the plama membrane. The cholesterol binding motif is essential for virus replication. Its partial removal affects various steps of the viral life cycle, such as assembly of new virus particles and their subsequent cell entry via membrane fusion. A cholesterol-binding pocket in group 2 HAs might be a promising target for a small lipophilic drug that inactivates the virus.",

This study investigated (i) whether information-processing biases changed following single-session computerised CBT for spider fear, and (ii) whether this effect could be augmented by administration of D-cycloserine (DCS). Spider-fearful individuals were randomized to receiving 250mg of DCS (n=21) or placebo (n=17) and spider fear was assessed using self-report, behavioural, and information-processing (Extrinsic Affective Simon Task & Approach Avoidance Task) measures. Linear mixed-effects analyses indicated improvements on self-report and behavioural spider fear following CBT, but not on cognitive bias measures. There was no evidence of an augmentation effect of DCS on any outcome. Cognitive biases at 1-day were not predictive of 1-month follow-up spider fear. These findings provide no evidence for information-processing biases relating to CBT response or augmentation with DCS.",

    "abstract": "In each round of ribosomal translation, the translational GTPase EF-Tu delivers a tRNA to the ribosome. After successful decoding, EF-Tu hydrolyses GTP, which triggers a conformational change that ultimately results in the release of the tRNA from EF-Tu. To identify the primary steps of these conformational changes and how they are prevented by the antibiotic kirromycin, we employed all-atom explicit-solvent Molecular Dynamics simulations of the full ribosome-EF-Tu complex. Our results suggest that after GTP hydrolysis and Pi release, the loss of interactions between the nucleotide and the switch 1 loop of EF-Tu allows domain D1 of EF-Tu to rotate relative to domains D2 and D3 and leads to an increased flexibility of the switch 1 loop. This rotation induces a closing of the D1-D3 interface and an opening of the D1-D2 interface. We propose that the opening of the D1-D2 interface, which binds the CCA-tail of the tRNA, weakens the crucial EF-Tu-tRNA interactions which lowers tRNA binding affinity, representing the first step of tRNA release. Kirromycin binds within the D1-D3 interface, sterically blocking its closure, but does not prevent hydrolysis. The resulting increased flexibility of switch 1 explains why it is not resolved in kirromycin-bound structures.",

As any other trait, the reproduction mode is subject to natural selection and may adapt to the environment.

The natural response to a dynamic environment seems to be bet hedging, where multiple reproductive strategies are stochastically executed. Here, we develop a framework for the evolution of simple multicellular life cycles in a dynamic environment. We use a matrix population model of undifferentiated multicellular groups undergoing fragmentation and ask which mode maximizes the population growth rate. Counterintuitively, we find that natural selection in dynamic environments generally tends to promote deterministic, not stochastic, reproduction modes.",

    "abstract": "Attentive motion tracking deficits, measured using multiple object tracking (MOT) tasks, have been identified in a number of visual and neurodevelopmental disorders such as amblyopia and autism. These deficits are often attributed to the abnormal development of high-level attentional networks. However, neuroimaging evidence from amblyopia suggests that reduced MOT performance can be explained by impaired function in motion sensitive area MT+ alone. To test the hypothesis that MT+ plays an important role in MOT, we assessed whether modulation of MT+ activity using continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) influenced MOT performance in participants with normal vision. An additional experiment involving numerosity judgements of MOT stimulus elements was conducted to control for non-specific effects of MT+ cTBS on psychophysical task performance. The MOT stimulus consisted of 4 target and 4 distractor dots and was presented at 10{degrees} eccentricity in the right or left hemifield. Functional MRI-guided cTBS was applied to left MT+. Participants (n = 13, age:27 {+/-} 3) attended separate active and sham cTBS sessions where the MOT task was completed before, 5 mins post and 30 mins post cTBS. Active cTBS significantly impaired MOT task accuracy relative to baseline for the right (stimulated) hemifield 5 mins (10 {+/-} 2% reduction; t12 = 1.95, p = 0.03) and 30 mins (14 {+/-} 3% reduction; t12 = 2.96, p = 0.01) post stimulation. No impairment occurred within the left (control) hemifield after active cTBS or for either hemifield after sham cTBS. Numerosity task performance was unaffected by cTBS. These results highlight the importance of lower-level motion processing for MOT and suggest that abnormal function of MT+ alone is sufficient to cause a deficit in MOT task performance.",

Conventional high-throughput imaging modalities either require movement of the sample to the focal plane of the imaging system1-3 or movement of the imaging system itself4,5, or use a wide-field approach to capture several samples in one frame. Schemes which move the sample or the imaging system can be mechanically complex and are inherently slow, while wide-field imaging systems have poor light collection efficiency and resolution compared to systems that image a single sample at a given time point. Our proposed ssHTS system uses a large parabolic reflector and an imaging lenses positioned at their focal distances above each sample. A fast LED array sequentially illuminate samples to generate images that are captured with a single camera placed at the focal point of the reflector. This optical configuration allows each sample to completely fill a sensors field of view. Since each LED illuminates a single sample and LED switch times are very fast, images from spatially separated samples can be captured at rates limited only by the cameras frame rate. The system is demonstrated by imaging cardiac monolayer and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) preparations.",

With the increasing genomic surveillance of pathogens, especially amid the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, new practical questions about their use are emerging.\n\nPoint 2One such question focuses on the inclusion of un-sequenced case occurrence data alongside sequenced data to improve phylodynamic analyses. This approach can be particularly valuable if sequencing efforts vary over time.\n\nPoint 3Using simulations, we demonstrate that birth-death phylodynamic models can employ occurrence data to eliminate bias in estimates of the basic reproductive number due to misspecification of the sampling process. In contrast, the coalescent exponential model is robust to such sampling biases, but in the absence of a sampling model it cannot exploit occurrence data. Subsequent analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the northwest USA supports these results.\n\nPoint 4We conclude that occurrence data are a valuable source of information in combination with birth-death models. These data should be used to bolster phylodynamic analyses of infectious diseases and other rapidly spreading species in the future.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidization, or whole genome duplication, is one of the major mechanisms of plant speciation. Allopolyploids (species that harbor polyploid genomes originating from hybridization of different diploid species) have been hypothesized to occupy a niche with intermediate, broader, or fluctuating environmental conditions compared with parental diploids. It remains unclear whether empirical data support this hypothesis and whether specialization of expression patterns of the homeologs (paralogous gene copies resulting from allopolyploidization) relates to habitat environments. Here, we studied the ecology and transcriptomics of a wild allopolyploid Cardamine flexuosa and its diploid parents C. hirsuta and C. amara at a fine geographical scale in their native area in Switzerland. We found that the diploid parents favored opposite extremes in terms of soil moisture, soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, and light availability. The habitat of the allopolyploid C. flexuosa was broader compared with those of its parental species and overlapped with those of the parents, but not at its extremes. In C. flexuosa, the genes related to water availability were overrepresented among those at both the expression level and the expression ratio of homeolog pairs, which varied among habitat environments. These findings provide empirical evidence for niche differentiation between an allopolyploid and its diploid parents at a fine scale, where both ecological and transcriptomic data indicated water availability to be the key environmental factor for niche differentiation.Significance statement Polyploidization, or whole genome duplication, is common in plants and may contribute to their ecological diversification. However, little is known about the niche differentiation of wild allopolyploids relative to their diploid parents and the gene expression patterns that may underlie such ecological divergence. We detected niche differentiation between the allopolyploid Cardamine flexuosa and its diploid parents C. amara and C. hirsuta along water availability gradient at a fine scale. The ecological differentiation was mirrored by the dynamic control of water availability-related gene expression patterns according to habitat environments. Thus, both ecological and transcriptomic data revealed niche differentiation between an allopolyploid species and its diploid parents.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cartilaginous fishes have a very high phenotypical diversity, a phenomenon for which the mechanisms have been largely unexplored. Here, we report the genome of the white-spotted bamboo shark as the first chromosome-level genome assembly of cartilaginous fish. Using this genome, we illustrated a dynamic chromosome rearrangement process in the bamboo shark, which resulted in the formation of 13 chromosomes, all of which were sparsely distributed with conserved genes and fast-evolving. We found the fast-evolving chromosomes to be enriched in immune-related genes with two chromosomes harboring the major genes for developing the single-chain antibody. We also found chromosome rearrangements to have resulted in the loss of two genes (p2rx3 and p2rx5) which we also showed were involved in cartilage development using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach in zebrafish. Our study highlighted the significance of chromosome rearrangements in the phenotypical evolution of cartilaginous fishes, providing clues to inform further studies on mechanisms for fish diversification.",

    "abstract": "Animals use olfaction to search for distant objects. Unlike vision, where objects are spaced out, olfactory information mixes when it reaches olfactory organs. Therefore, efficient olfactory search requires segregating odors that are mixed with background odors. Animals can segregate known target odors by detecting short differences in the arrival of odorants from different sources (stimulus onset asynchrony). However, it is unclear whether animals can also use stimulus onset asynchrony to segregate previously unknown odorants that have no innate or learned relevance. Using behavioral experiments in honey bees, we here show that stimulus onset asynchrony also improves odor-background segregation of unknown odorants. The stimulus onset asynchrony necessary to behaviorally segregate unknown odorants is in the range of seconds, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the previously reported stimulus asynchrony sufficient for segregating known odorants. We propose that for unknown odorants, odor-background segregation requires sensory adaptation to the background stimulus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe clinical relevance of V-A (un)coupling in critically ill patients is under investigation. In this study we measured the association between V-A coupling and oxygen consumption (VO2) response in patients with acute circulatory instability following cardiac surgery.\\n\\nMethods and resultsSixty-one cardio-thoracic ICU patients who received fluid challenge or norepinephrine infusion were included. Arterial pressure, cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), arterial (EA), and ventricular elastances (EV), total indexed peripheral resistance (TPRi) were assessed before and after hemodynamic interventions. VO2 responders were defined as VO2 increase > 15 %. V-A coupling was evaluated by the ratio EA/EV. Left ventricle stroke work (SW) to pressure volume area (PVA) ratio was calculated. In the overall population, 24 patients (39%) were VO2 responders and 48 patients were uncoupled (i.e., EA/EV ratio > 1.3): 1.9 (1.6-2.4). Most of the uncoupled patients were classified as VO2 responders (28 of 31 patients, p=0.031). Changes in VO2 were correlated with those of TPRi, EA, EA/EV and CO. EA/EV ratio predicted VO2 increase with an AUC of 0.76 [95 % CI: 0.62-0.87]; p=0.001. In multivariate and principal component analyses, EA/EV and SW/PVA ratios were independently associated (P < 0.05) with VO2 response following interventions.\\n\\nConclusionsVO2 responders were characterized by baseline V-A uncoupling due to high EA and low EV. Baseline EA/EV and SW/PVA ratios were associated with VO2 changes independently of the hemodynamic intervention used. These results further underline the pathophysiological significance of V-A uncoupling in patients with hemodynamic instability.",

    "abstract": "The neurovascular coupling is mostly considered as a master-slave relationship between the neurons and the cerebral vessels: the neurons demand energy which the vessels supply in the form of glucose and oxygen. In the recent past both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the neurovascular coupling is a bidirectional system, a loop that includes a feedback signal from the vessels influencing neural firing and plasticity. An integrated model of bidirectionally connected neural network and vascular network is hence required to understand the relationship between the informational and metabolic aspects of neural dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of the bidirectional neurovascular system in the whisker barrel cortex and study the effect of such coupling on neural activity and plasticity as manifest in the map formation. In this model, a biologically plausible self-organizing network model of rate coded, dynamic neurons is nourished by a network of vessels modeled using the biophysical properties of blood vessels. The neural layer which is designed to simulate the whisker barrel cortex of rat transmits the vasodilatory signals to the vessels. The feedback from the vessels is in the form of available oxygen for oxidative metabolism whose end result is the ATP necessary to fuel neural firing. The model captures the effect of the feedback from the vascular network on the neuronal map formation in the whisker barrel model under normal and pathological (Hypoxia and Hypoxia-Ischemia) conditions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAlthough neurovascular coupling is typically depicted as a unidirectional influence originating from the neurons and acting on the cerebral vessels, in reality it forms a bidirectional system, consisting of neuronal energy demand signals transmitted to the vessels, and a feedback of metabolic substrates from the vessels, that influence the neural firing and plasticity. We present a computational model of the bidirectional neurovascular coupling in the whisker barrel cortex of rats and study the effect of such coupling on neural activity and plasticity as manifest in the map formation. The model consists of a biologically plausible self-organizing dynamic, neural network model and a biophysical vascular network model that nourishes the neural network in the form of oxygen necessary for neural oxidative metabolism. The model reproduces the spatio-temporal hemodynamic responses observed in rat whisker barrel cortex. It also demonstrates the essentiality of the vascular feedback on the whisker barrel map formation under normal and pathological conditions.",

In 2018, LF caused an unprecedented outbreak in Nigeria, and the situation was worse in 2019. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of outbreaks in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and local rainfall by using modeling analysis.\\n\\nMethodsWe quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz, and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points ({tau}) in different regions at different time periods. Cochrans Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and local rainfall with various lag terms.\\n\\nFindingsOur estimated Rs for 2017-18 (1.33 with 95% CI: [1.29, 1.37]) and 2018-19 (1.29 with 95% CI: [1.27, 1.32]) are significantly higher than those for 2016-17 (1.23 with 95% CI: [1.22, 1.24]). We report spatial heterogeneity in the Rs for outbreaks in different Nigerian regions. For the association between rainfall and R, we find that a one unit (mm) increase in average rainfall over the past 7 months could cause a 0.62% (95% CI: [0.20%, 1.05%]) rise in R.\\n\\nConclusionThere is significant spatial heterogeneity in the LF epidemics in different Nigerian regions.

    "abstract": "Up to 50% of patients with the multibacillary form of leprosy is expected to develop acute systemic inflammatory episodes known as type 2 reactions (T2R), thus aggravating their clinical status. Thalidomide rapidly improves T2R symptoms. But, due to its restricted use worldwide, novel alternative therapies are urgently needed. A hallmark of T2R lesions is the presence of a neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate. In this study, the potential involvement of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) production in T2R pathogenesis was investigated. Abundant NETs were found in T2R skin lesions, and increased spontaneous NETs formation was observed in T2R peripheral neutrophils. Both the M. leprae whole-cell sonicate and the CpG-Hlp complex, mimicking a mycobacterial TLR9 ligand, were able to induce NETs production in vitro. Moreover, TLR9 expression was shown to be higher in T2R neutrophils, suggesting that DNA recognition via TLR9 may be one of the pathways triggering this process during T2R. Finally, treatment of T2R patients with thalidomide for 7 consecutive days resulted in decreasing all of the evaluated in vivo and ex vivo NETosis parameters. Altogether, our findings shed light on the pathogenesis of T2R, which, it is hoped, will contribute to the emergence of novel alternative therapies in the near future.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLeprosy is caused by a mycobacterium that has a predilection for skin and nerve cells. The chronic course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes known as reactions, despite effective bacterial killing with antibiotics. Reactions aggravate patients clinical status and may become a medical emergency. Type 2 reactions (T2R) only occur in patients with high bacterial burden and is treated with thalidomide and/or corticosteroids. We are interested in understanding how inflammation is triggered and amplified during T2R. In this study we investigated the potential role of extracellular DNA released by neutrophils (known as NETs) in T2R, since they have been shown to cause inflammation. Abundant NETs were found in T2R skin lesions, and increased spontaneous NETs formation was observed in neutrophils present in the blood of T2R patients. Moreover, bacterial constituents were able to induce NETs production. Finally, treatment of T2R patients with thalidomide resulted in decreased NET formation. Altogether, our findings shed light on the pathogenesis of T2R, which, it is hoped, will contribute to the identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis and emergence of novel alternative therapies in the near future.",

    "abstract": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) mediates many of the toxic effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). However, the AHR alone is insufficient to explain the widely different outcomes among organisms. Attempts to identify unknown factor(s) have been confounded by genetic variability of model organisms. Here, we evaluated three transgenic mouse lines, each expressing a different rat AHR isoform (rWT, DEL, and INS), as well as C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice. We supplement these with whole-genome sequencing and transcriptomic analyses of the corresponding rat models: Long-Evans (L-E) and Han/Wistar (H/W) rats. These integrated multi-species genomic and transcriptomic data were used to identify genes associated with TCDD-response phenotypes.\\n\\nWe identified several genes that show consistent transcriptional changes in both transgenic mice and rats. Hepatic Pxdc1 was significantly repressed by TCDD in C57BL/6, rWT mice, and in L-E rat. Three genes demonstrated different AHRE-1 (full) motif occurrences within their promoter regions: Cxxc5 had fewer occurrences in H/W, as compared with L-E; Sugp1 and Hgfac (in either L-E or H/W respectively). These genes also showed different patterns of mRNA abundance across strains.\\n\\nThe AHR isoform explains much of the transcriptional variability: up to 50% of genes with altered mRNA abundance following TCDD exposure are associated with a single AHR isoform (30% and 10% unique to DEL and rWT respectively following 500 g/kg TCDD). Genomic and transcriptomic evidence allowed identification of genes potentially involved in phenotypic outcomes: Pxdc1 had differential mRNA abundance by phenotype; Cxxc5 had altered AHR binding sites and differential mRNA abundance.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEnvironmental contaminants such as dioxins cause many toxic responses, anything from chloracne (common in humans) to death. These toxic responses are mostly regulated by the Ahr, a ligand-activated transcription factor with roles in drug metabolism and immune responses, however other contributing factors remain unclear. Studies are complicated by the underlying genetic heterogeneity of model organisms. Our team evaluated a number of mouse and rat models, including two strains of mouse, two strains of rat and three transgenic mouse lines which differ only at the Ahr locus, that present widely different sensitivities to the most potent dioxin: 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). We identified a number of changes to gene expression that were associated with different toxic responses. We then contrasted these findings with results from whole-genome sequencing of the H/W and L-E rats and found some key genes, such as Cxxc5 and Mafb, which might contribute to TCDD toxicity. These transcriptomic and genomic datasets will provide a valuable resource for future studies into the mechanisms of dioxin toxicities.",

    "abstract": "The reduction of synthetic fungicides in agriculture a major challenge in maintaining sustainable production, protecting the environment and consumers health. Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Plasmopora viticola is the major pathogen in viticulture worldwide and responsible for up to 60% of pesticide treatments. Alternatives to reduce fungicides are thus utterly needed to ensure sustainable vineyard-ecosystems, consumer health and public acceptance. Essential oils (EOs) are amongst the most promising natural plant protection alternatives and have shown their antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties on several agricultural crops. However, the efficiency of EOs highly depends on timing, application method and the molecular interactions between the host, the pathogen and EO. Despite proven EO efficiency, the underlying processes are still not understood and remain a black box. The objectives of the present study were: a) to evaluate whether a continuous fumigation of a particular EO can control downy mildew in order to circumvent the drawbacks of direct application, b) to decipher molecular mechanisms that could be triggered in the host and the pathogen by EO application and c) to try to differentiate whether essential oils directly repress the oomycete or act as plant resistance primers.\\n\\nA custom-made climatic chamber was used for a continuous fumigation of potted vines with different EOs during long-term experiments. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cv Chasselas was chosen in reason of its high susceptibility to Plasmopara viticola. Grapevine cuttings were infected with P. viticola. and subsequently exposed to continuous fumigation of different EOs at different concentrations, during 2 application time spans (24 hours and 10 days). Experiments were stopped when infection symptoms were clearly observed on the leaves of the control plants. Plant physiology (photosynthesis and growth rate parameters) were recorded and leaves were sampled at different time points for subsequent RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Strikingly, the Oregano vulgare essential oil vapour treatment during 24h post-infection proved to be sufficient to reduce downy mildew development by 95%. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 24h and 10d treatments and used for whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced reads were then mapped onto the V. vinifera and P. viticola genomes. Less than 1% of reads could be mapped onto the P. viticola genome from treated samples, whereas up to 30 % reads from the controls mapped onto the P. viticola genome, thereby confirming the visual observation of P. viticola absence in the treated plants. On average, 80 % of reads could be mapped onto the V. vinifera genome for differential expression analysis, which yielded 4800 modulated genes. Transcriptomic data clearly showed that the treatment triggered the plants innate immune system with genes involved in salicylic, jasmonic acid and ethylene synthesis and signaling, activating Pathogenenesis-Related-proteins as well as phytoalexin synthesis.\\n\\nThese results elucidate EO-host-pathogen interactions for the first time and indicate that the antifungal efficiency of EO is mainly due to the triggering of resistance pathways inside the host plants. This is of major importance for the production and research on biopesticides, plant stimulation products and for resistance-breeding strategies\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe reduction of synthetic plant protection products is a major concern of modern agriculture. The oomycete Plasmopora viticola which causes downy mildew in grapevine is amongst the most important grapevine pests and responsible for the dispersion of huge amounts of pesticides in vineyards. Among the evaluated alternatives to reduce or replace synthetic pesticides, plant volatile compounds could represent a sustainable solution. Some plant essential oils (EOs) have already shown antifungal capacities. However, their application is often difficult in terms of the right timing of treatment, degradation, bad rainfastness, mixability and phytotoxicity.\\n\\nThe aim of the present work was to investigate whether the vapour phase, applied by a continuous fumigation of different EOs, might inhibit the development of downy mildew on grapevine, and in case of proven efficiency, to study the induced transcriptomic changes by RNA-sequencing in an attempt to elucidate the underlaying molecular interactions. Our results showed that the vapour phases of O. vulgare and T. vulgaris were highly efficient against the pathogen. The study of differentially expressed genes indicated that the EO vapour triggered the main mechanisms of the plants innate immune system such as PTI (Pattern-Triggered Immunity) and ETI (Effector Triggered immunity).\\n\\nFor the first time these results highlight the effects of EOs vapour on plant genes expression, which is very valuable information for the development of new natural plant protection products, as well as for breeding disease resistant cultivars.",

    "abstract": "The receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility (RHAMM) is upregulated in various cancers. We previously screened genes upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinomas for their metastatic function in a mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) and identified that human RHAMMB promoted liver metastasis. It was unknown whether RHAMMB is upregulated in pancreatic cancer or contributes to its progression. In this study, we found that RHAMM protein was frequently upregulated in human PNETs. We investigated alternative splicing isoforms, RHAMMA and RHAMMB, by RNA-Seq analysis of primary PNETs and liver metastases. RHAMMB, but not RHAMMA, was significantly upregulated in liver metastases. RHAMMB was crucial for in vivo metastatic capacity of mouse and human PNETs. RHAMMA, carrying an extra 15-amino acid-stretch, did not promote metastasis in spontaneous and experimental metastasis mouse models. Moreover, RHAMMB was substantially higher than RHAMMA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). RHAMMB, but not RHAMMA, correlated with both higher EGFR expression and poorer survival of PDAC patients. Knockdown of EGFR abolished RHAMMB-driven PNET metastasis. Altogether, our findings suggest a clinically relevant function of RHAMMB, but not RHAMMA, in promoting PNET metastasis in part through EGFR signaling. RHAMMB can thus serve as a prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling has shown that epigenetic abnormalities are biologically important in glioma and can be used to classify these tumors into distinct prognostic groups. Thus far, DNA profiling has required surgically resected glioma tissue; however, gliomas release tumoral material into biofluids, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid, providing an opportunity for a minimally invasive testing. While prior studies have shown that genetic and epigenetic markers can be detected in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (e.g., liquid biopsy [LB]), there has been low sensitivity for tumor-specific markers. We hypothesize that the low sensitivity is due to the targeted assay methods. Therefore, we profiled the genome-wide CpG methylation levels in DNA of tumor tissue and cell-free DNA in serum of glioma patients, to identify non-invasive epigenetic LB (eLB) markers in the serum that reflect the characteristics of the tumor tissue. From the epigenetic profiles of serum from patients diagnosed with glioma (N=15 IDH mutant and N=7 IDH wildtype) and with epilepsy (N=3), we defined glioma-specific and IDH-specific eLB signatures (Glioma-eLB and IDH-eLB, respectively). The epigenetic profiles of the matched tissue demonstrate that these eLB signatures reflected the signature of the tumor. Through cross-validation we show that Glioma-eLB can accurately predict a patients glioma from those with other neoplasias (N=6 Colon; N=14 Pituitary; N=3 Breast; N=4 Lung), non-neoplastic immunological conditions (N=22 sepsis; N=9 pancreatic islet transplantation), and from healthy individuals (sensitivity: 98%; specificity: 99%). Finally, IDH-eLB includes promoter methylated markers associated with genes known to be involved in glioma tumorigenesis (PVT1 and CXCR6). The application of the non-invasive eLB signature discovered in this study has the potential to complement the standard of care for patients harboring glioma.",

    "abstract": "Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) is highly prevalent in cancer yet inhibitors against these kinases currently show use in restricted tumour contexts. The extent to which cancers depend on CDK4/6 and what may undermine such dependency is poorly understood. Here we report that signalling engaging the MET proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) axis leads to CDK4/6-independent CDK2-activation, involving as a critical mechanistic events loss of the CDK inhibitor p21CIP1 and gain of its regulator, the ubiquitin ligase subunit SKP2. Combined inhibition of MET/FAK and CDK4/6 eliminates proliferation capacity of cancer cells in culture, and enhances tumour growth inhibition in vivo. Activation of the MET/FAK axis is known to arise through cancer extrinsic and intrinsic cues. Our work predicts that such cues support cell division independent of the activity of the cell cycle-regulating CDK4/6 kinases and identifies MET/FAK as a tractable route to broaden the utility of CDK4/6 inhibitor-based therapies in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman urine is now recognised as a non-invasive source of stem cells with regeneration potential. These cells are mesenchymal stem cells but their detailed molecular and cellular identities are poorly defined. Furthermore, unlike the mouse, the gene regulatory network driving self-renewal and differentiation into functional renal cells in vitro remain unresolved.\\n\\nMethodsWe isolated urine stem cells from 10 individuals from both genders and distinct ages, characterized them as renal progenitor cells and explored the gene regulatory network sustaining self-renewal.\\n\\nResultsThese cells express pluripotency-associated proteins-TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA4, C-KIT and CD133. Expression of pluripotency-associated proteins enabled rapid reprogramming into iPSCs using episomal-based plasmids without pathway perturbations. Transcriptome analysis revealed expression of a plethora of nephrogenesis-related genes such as SIX2, OSR1, CITED1, NPHS2, NPHS1, PAX2, SALL1, AQP2, EYA1, SLC12A1 and UMOD. As expected, the cells transport Albumin by endocytosis. Based on this, we refer to these cells as urine derived renal progenitor cells-UdRPCs. Associated GO-term analysis of UdRPCs and UdRPC-iPSCs underlined their renal identity and functionality. Upon differentiation by WNT activation using the GSK3{beta}-inhibitor (CHIR99021), transcriptome and KEGG pathway analysis revealed upregulation of WNT-associated genes-AXIN2, JUN and NKD1. Protein interaction network identified JUN- a downstream target of the WNT pathway in association with STAT3, ATF2 and MAPK1 as a putative regulator of self-renewal and differentiation in UdRPCs. Furthermore, like pluripotent stem cells, self-renewal is maintained by FGF2-driven TGF{beta}-SMAD2/3 pathway.\\n\\nConclusionThis in vitro model and the data presented should lay the foundation for studying nephrogenesis in man.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHuman urine is a non-invasive source of stem cells with regeneration potential. Here, we investigated the cellular and molecular identities, and the gene regulation driving self-renewal and differentiation of these cells in vitro. These cells express pluripotency-associated markers enabling easy reprogramming. Based on the expression of renal associated genes, proteins and functionality, we refer to these cells as urine derived renal progenitor cells-UdRPCs. CHIR99021-induced differentiation of UdRPCs activated WNT-related genes-AXIN2, JUN and NKD1. Protein interaction network identified JUN as a putative regulator of differentiation whereas self-renewal is maintained by FGF2-driven TGF{beta}-SMAD2/3. Our data will enhance understanding of the molecular identities of UdRPCs, and enable the generation of renal disease models in vitro and eventually kidney-associated regenerative therapies.",

    "abstract": "It is essential for early human life that immunological responses to developing embryos are tightly regulated. An imbalance in the activation and regulation of the human complement system occurs in pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia and recurrent miscarriage. We hereby present the first full analysis of the expression and deposition of complement molecules in human pre-implantation embryos. Thus far, immunological imbalance has been considered in stages of pregnancy following implantation. We here show that complement activation and deposition takes place on developing human embryos already at the pre-implantation stage. Using confocal microscopy, we observed deposition of activation products such as C1q, C3 and C5 on healthy developing embryos, which highlights the need for strict complement regulation. The early embryos express the complement membrane inhibitors CD46, CD55 and CD59 and bind the soluble regulators C4bp and factor H. These findings show that complement targets human embryos, and indicate potential adverse pregnancy outcomes, if regulation of activation fails. In addition, single-cell RNA sequencing of embryos at oocyte, zygote, 4-cell and 8-cell stages showed expression of complement genes, e.g. C1s, C2, C3, C5, factor B and factor D. This shows that the embryonic cells themselves have the capacity to express C3 and C5, which may become activated and function as mediators of cellular signaling. The specific local embryonic expression of complement components, regulators, and deposition of activation products on the surface of embryos suggests that complement has immunoregulatory functions and may impact cellular homeostasis and differentiation at the earliest stage of human life.\\n\\nStatement of significanceWhile canonical functions of the complement system relate to pathogen-defence, it is known to drive certain immune pathologies. The work here described shows, for the first time, expression and localization of a full range of complement molecules in human pre-implantation embryos. We demonstrate complement attack against early embryos, and show presence of embryonic defence mechanisms. Furthermore, we reveal early embryonic production of complement activators, suggesting non-canonical roles in cell signalling and development. Our findings thus reveal a fundamental role for complement at the earliest stages of human embryogenesis. Our data opens up for future studies into the role of complement, both in relation to infertility and pregnancy complications, as well as basic cellular processes during early human development.",

In cell culture studies and with laboratory animal models, the nucleoside analogue favipiravir (T-705) has demonstrated great potential for the treatment of several seasonal, chronic and emerging RNA virus infections of humans, suggesting applicability to control some viral outbreaks. Treatment with favipiravir was shown to reduce the infectivity of Rift Valley fever virus both in cell cultures and in experimental animal models, but the mechanism of this protective effect is not understood. In this work we show that favipiravir at concentrations well below the toxicity threshold estimated for cells is able to extinguish RVFV from infected cell cultures. Nucleotide sequence analysis has documented RVFV mutagenesis associated with virus extinction, with a significant increase in G to A and C to U transition frequencies, and a decrease of specific infectivity, hallmarks of lethal mutagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a threat to mankind because it generates yearly epidemics and poorly predictable sporadic pandemics with catastrophic potential. IAV has a small RNA genome composed of 8 mini-chromosomes (segments) that constitute a 5UTR followed by a coding region and a 3UTR. Transcription of IAV RNA into mRNA depends on host mRNA, as the viral polymerase cleaves 5m7G-capped nascent transcripts to use as primers to initiate viral mRNA synthesis. We hypothesized that captured host transcripts bearing AUG could drive the expression of upstream ORFs in the viral segments, a phenomenon that would depend on the translatability of the viral 5UTRs. Here we report the existence of this mechanism, which generates host-virus chimeric proteins. We label these proteins as Upstream Flu ORFs (UFO). Depending on the frame, two types of host-virus UFO proteins are made: canonical viral proteins with human-derived N term extensions or novel uncharacterized proteins. Here we show that both types are made during IAV infection. Sequences that enable chimeric protein synthesis are conserved across IAV strains, indicating that selection allowed the expansion of the proteome diversity of IAV in infected cells to include multiple human-virus proteins.",

However, both the biosensor specificity and the correlation between ligand concentration and biosensor output signal, also known as the transfer function, often needs to be optimized before meeting application needs. Here, we present a versatile and high-throughput method to evolve and functionalize prokaryotic aTF specificity and transfer functions in a eukaryote chassis, namely bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From a single round of directed evolution of the effector-binding domain (EBD) coupled with various toggled selection regimes, we robustly select aTF variants of the cis, cis-muconic acid-inducible transcription factor BenM evolved for change in ligand specificity, increased dynamic output range, shifts in operational range, and a complete inversion of function from activation to repression. Importantly, by targeting only the EBD, the evolved biosensors display DNA-binding affinities similar to BenM, and are functional when ported back into a non-native prokaryote chassis. The developed platform technology thus leverages aTF evolvability for the development of new host-agnostic biosensors with user-defined small-molecule specificities and transfer functions.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive method used to modulate activity of superficial brain regions. Deeper and more steerable stimulation could potentially be achieved using transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS): two high-frequency alternating fields interact to produce a wave with an envelope frequency in the range thought to modulate neural activity. Promising initial results have been reported for experiments with mice. In this study we aim to better understand the electric fields produced with tTIS and examine its prospects in humans through simulations with murine and human head models. A murine head finite element model was used to simulate previously published experiments of tTIS in mice. With a total current of 0.776 mA, tTIS electric field strengths up to 383 V/m were reached in the modeled mouse brain, affirming experimental results indicating that suprathreshold stimulation is possible in mice. Using a detailed anisotropic human head model, tTIS was simulated with systematically varied electrode configurations and input currents to investigate how these parameters influence the electric fields. An exhaustive search with 88 electrode locations covering the entire head (146M current patterns) was employed to optimize tTIS for target field strength and focality. In all analyses, we investigated maximal effects and effects along the predominant orientation of local neurons. Our results showed that it was possible to steer the peak tTIS field by manipulating the relative strength of the two input fields. Deep brain areas received field strengths similar to conventional tACS, but with less stimulation in superficial areas. Maximum field strengths in the human model were much lower than in the murine model, too low to expect direct stimulation effects. While field strengths from tACS were slightly higher, our results suggest that tTIS is capable of producing more focal fields and allows for better steerability. Finally, we present optimal four-electrode current patterns to maximize tTIS in regions of the pallidum (0.37 V/m), hippocampus (0.24 V/m) and motor cortex (0.57 V/m).",

    "abstract": "MYO19 interacts with mitochondria through a C-terminal membrane association domain (MyMOMA). The specific mechanisms for localization of MYO19 to mitochondria are poorly understood. Using new promiscuous biotinylation data in combination with existing affinity-capture databases, we have identified a number of putative MYO19-interacting proteins. We chose to further explore the interaction between MYO19 and the mitochondrial GTPase Miro2 by expressing mchr-Miro2 in combination with GFP-tagged fragments of the MyMOMA domain and assaying for recruitment of MYO19-GFP to mitochondria. Co-expression of MYO19898-970-GFP with mchr-Miro2 enhanced MYO19898-970-GFP localization to mitochondria. Mislocalizing Miro2 to filopodial tips or the cytosolic face of the nuclear envelope did not recruit MYO19898-970-GFP to either location. To address the kinetics of the Miro2/MYO19 interaction, we used FRAP analysis and permeabilization-activated reduction in fluorescence (PARF) analysis. MyMOMA constructs containing a putative membrane insertion motif but lacking the Miro2-interacting region displayed slow exchange kinetics. MYO19898-970-GFP, which does not include the membrane-insertion motif, displayed rapid exchange kinetics, suggesting that the MYO19 interacting with Miro2 has higher mobility than MYO19 inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mutation of well-conserved, charged residues within MYO19 or within the switch I and II regions of Miro2 abolished the enhancement of MYO19898-970-GFP localization in cells ectopically expressing mchr-Miro2. Additionally, expressing mutant versions of Miro2 thought to represent particular nucleotide states indicated that the enhancement of MYO19898-970-GFP localization is dependent on Miro2 nucleotide state. Taken together, these data suggest that membrane-inserted MYO19 is part of a larger complex, and that Miro2 plays a role in integration of actin- and microtubule-based mitochondrial activities.",

To control the excess production of this aldosterone an inhibitor \\\"Fadrozole\\\" is being used which is associated with an active site cavity of CYP11B2. This study has been divided into two parts. In the first part, the four computational tools (SIFT, Polyphen-2, I-Mutant, ConSurf) were used to identify 29 deleterious SNPs out of 1600 CYP11B2 SNPs. In the second part, five residues (R448G, R141P, W260R, F130S, and F445S) were identified in the active site cavity (out of 29 deleterious CYP11B2 SNPs) at the distance of 5A{degrees}. Binding free energy calculation as well as Dynamics simulation techniques were applied to determine the effect of these mutations on the CYP11B2-Fadrozole compound. The results showed that Fadrozole binding with CYP11B2 became stronger which proved the efficiency of this drug inhibitor with these highly damaging mutations. Our study will be useful for selecting the high priority CYP11B2 mutations, which could be further, investigated in this gene-associated study, for better understanding of the structural and functional aspects of the observed (CYP11B2) protein.",

    "abstract": "Subtropical reefs are unique ecosystems that require effective management - informed by regular ecological monitoring - to foster resilience to environmental changes. Resources to conduct monitoring are limited, and citizen science can complement data from local management agencies. Here, citizen science efforts document the ecological status of a subtropical reef, Flinders Reef, Moreton Bay Marine Park, Australia. Ecological surveys, following Reef Check Australia and CoralWatch protocols, were conducted by 44 trained volunteers. Ten sites at Flinders Reef were surveyed at 5-10 m depth in autumn and spring. Additionally, underwater photos and depth surveys were integrated with satellite imagery to create a detailed habitat map. Coral cover across sites ranged between 14% and 67%. Branching corals dominated the site with 67% cover and showed 89% dissimilarity in coral community composition compared to other sites. Coral community composition was mostly explained by spatial variation, of which 16% was influenced by wave exposure. Observed reef impacts including physical damage, unknown scars and coral disease were three times lower than studies on more accessible reefs in Moreton Bay Marine Park. Invertebrate abundance was relatively low (6.65 individuals per 100 m2), with the most abundant groups observed being sea urchins (Diadema spp.), gastropods (Drupella spp.) and anemones. Butterflyfish were recorded at every site and were the most abundant fish group surveyed. Findings highlight the healthy condition of Flinders Reef, likely influenced by its offshore location and protection status as a  no-take zone. This study demonstrates that increasing the current 500m radius protection zone by a further 500m could double the protected area of coral, offering potential further conservation benefits. The findings resulting from the ecological data analysis and created benthic habitat map, provide an example of how citizen science based projects can assist marine park authorities and the public in ongoing conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Production of healthy gametes in meiosis relies on the quality control and proper distribution of both nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. Meiotic differentiation naturally eliminates age-induced cellular damage by an unknown mechanism. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in budding yeast, we found that nuclear senescence factors - including protein aggregates, extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles, and abnormal nucleolar material - are sequestered away from chromosomes during meiosis II and subsequently eliminated. A similar sequestration and elimination process occurs for the core subunits of the nuclear pore complex in both young and old cells. Nuclear envelope remodeling drives the formation of a membranous compartment containing the sequestered material. Importantly, de novo generation of plasma membrane is required for the sequestration event, preventing the inheritance of long-lived nucleoporins and senescence factors into the newly formed gametes. Our study uncovers a new mechanism of nuclear quality control and provides insight into its function in meiotic cellular rejuvenation.",

    "abstract": "Gene loops are formed by the interaction of initiation and termination factors occupying the distal ends of a gene during transcription. RNAPII is believed to affect gene looping indirectly owing to its essential role in transcription. The results presented here, however, demonstrate a direct role of RNAPII in gene looping through the Rpb4 subunit. 3C analysis revealed that gene looping is abolished in the rpb4{Delta} mutant. In contrast to the other looping-defective mutants, rpb4{Delta} cells do not exhibit a transcription termination defect. RPB4 overexpression, however, rescued the transcription termination and gene looping defect of sua7-1, a mutant of TFIIB. Furthermore, RPB4 overexpression rescued the ssu72-2 gene looping defect, while SSU72 overexpression restored the formation of gene loops in rpb4{Delta} cells. Interestingly, the interaction of TFIIB with Ssu72 is compromised in rpb4{Delta} cells. These results suggest that the TFIIB-Ssu72 interaction, which is critical for gene loop formation, is facilitated by Rpb4. We propose that Rpb4 is promoting the transfer of RNAPII from the terminator to the promoter for reinitiation of transcription through TFIIB-Ssu72 mediated gene looping.",

    "abstract": "The ability to coordinate behavioral responses with metabolic status is fundamental to the maintenance of energy homeostasis. In numerous species including C. elegans and mammals, neural serotonin signaling regulates a range of food-related behaviors. However, the mechanisms that integrate metabolic information with serotonergic circuits are poorly characterized. Here, we identify metabolic, molecular, and cellular components of a circuit that links peripheral metabolic state to serotonin-regulated behaviors in C. elegans. We find that blocking the entry of fatty acyl-CoAs into peroxisomal {beta}-oxidation in the intestine results in blunting of the effects of neural serotonin signaling on feeding and egg-laying behaviors. Comparative genomics and metabolomics revealed that interfering with intestinal peroxisomal {beta}-oxidation results in a modest global transcriptional change but significant changes to the metabolome, including a large number of changes in ascaroside and phospholipid species, some of which affect feeding behavior. We also identify body cavity neurons and an ether-a-go-go related (EAG) potassium channel that functions in these neurons as key cellular components of the circuitry linking peripheral metabolic signals to regulation of neural serotonin signaling. These data raise the possibility that the effects of serotonin on satiety may have their origins in feedback, homeostatic metabolic responses from the periphery.",

    "abstract": "Despite its clinical importance, detection of highly divergent or yet unknown viruses is a major challenge. When human samples are sequenced, conventional alignments classify many assembled contigs as \\\"unknown\\\" since many of the sequences are not similar to known genomes. In this work, we developed ViraMiner, a deep learning-based method to identify viruses in various human biospecimens. ViraMiner contains two branches of Convolutional Neural Networks designed to detect both patterns and pattern-frequencies on raw metagenomics contigs. The training dataset included sequences obtained from 19 metagenomic experiments which were analyzed and labeled by BLAST. The model achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to other machine learning methods for viral genome classification. Using 300 bp contigs ViraMiner achieves 0.923 area under the ROC curve. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning methodology that can detect the presence of viral sequences among raw metagenomic contigs from diverse human samples. We suggest that the proposed model captures different types of information of genome composition, and can be used as a recommendation system to further investigate sequences labeled as \\\"unknown\\\" by conventional alignment methods. Exploring these highly-divergent viruses, in turn, can enhance our knowledge of infectious causes of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Living matter is a quasi-stationary out-of-equilibrium system; in this physical condition, structural fluctuations at nano- and meso-scales are needed to understand the physics behind its biological functionality. Myelin has a simple ultrastructure whose fluctuations show correlated disorder in its functional out-of-equilibrium state. However, there is no information on the relationship between this correlated disorder and the dynamics of the intrinsically disordered Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) which is expected to influence the membrane structure and overall functionality. In this work, we have investigated the role of this protein structural dynamics in the myelin ultrastructure fluctuations in and out-of-equilibrium conditions, by using synchrotron Scanning micro X Ray Diffraction and Small Angle X ray Scattering. We have induced the crossover from out-of-equilibrium functional state to in-equilibrium degeneration changing the pH far away from physiological condition. While the observed compression of the cytosolic layer thickness probes the unfolding of the P2 protein and of the cytoplasmic P0 domain (P0cyt), the intrinsic large MBP fluctuations preserve the cytosol structure also in the degraded state. Thus, the transition of myelin ultrastructure from correlated to uncorrelated disordered state, is significantly affected by the unfolding of the P2 and P0 proteins, which in this latter state do not act in synergistic manner with MBP to determine the membrane functionality.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEA better comprehension of myelin degenerative process and the role of protein dynamics in this biological membrane is a topic issue in todays scientific community. The myelin ultrastructural fluctuations exhibit correlated disorder in its functional state, that becomes uncorrelated as it degenerates. In this work we elucidate the interplay of protein structural dynamics and myelin ultrastructure in the transition from its functional state to the degraded state. The results highlight that the intrinsically disordered Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) allows to preserve the myelin structure following both the small correlated fluctuations in physiological state and the large disordered fluctuations in degraded conditions, where the myelin functionality is close to being lost and the MBP remains the single active protein.",

We present a random forest-based classification model to predict aggressive behaviour of PCa.

The model was validated with data from two large independent PCa cohorts from the \\\"International Cancer Genome Consortium\\\" (ICGC) and \\\"The Cancer Genome Atlas\\\" (TCGA). Ranking of cancer progression-related DNA methylation changes allowed selection of candidate genes for additional validation by immunohistochemistry. We identified loss of ZIC2 protein expression, mediated by alterations in DNA methylation, as a promising novel prognostic biomarker for PCa in >12,000 tissue micro-array tumors. The prognostic value of ZIC2 proved to be independent from established clinico-pathological variables including Gleason grade, tumor stage, nodal stage and PSA. In summary, we have developed a PCa classification model, which either directly or via expression analyses of the identified top ranked candidate genes might help in decision making related to the treatment of prostate cancer patients.",

Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and magneto-encephalography (MEG), we investigated the temporal dynamics of information processing for unconscious and conscious stimuli. We decoded stimulus information from the brain recordings while manipulating visual consciousness by presenting stimuli at threshold contrast in a backward masking paradigm. Participants consciousness was measured using both a forced-choice categorisation task and self-report. We show that brain activity during both conscious and non-conscious trials contained stimulus information, and that this information was enhanced in conscious trials. Overall, our results indicate that visual consciousness is characterised by enhanced neural activity representing the visual stimulus, and that this effect arises as early as 180 ms post-stimulus onset.",

The key challenges are the inconsistency of TMB measurement among assays and a lack of meaningful threshold for TMB classification. We describe a powerful and flexible statistical framework for estimation and classification of TMB (ecTMB). ecTMB uses an explicit background mutation model to predict TMB robustly and consistently. In addition to the two known TMB subtypes, TMB-high and TMB-low, we discovered a novel TMB subtype, named TMB-extreme, which was significantly associated with patient survival outcome. This discovery enabled ecTMB to classify samples to biologically and clinically relevant subtypes defined by TMB.",

We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, a large, diverse, and robustly generated dataset, to understand the factors that contribute to contamination. We obtained GTEx datasets and technical metadata and validating RNA-Seq from other studies. Of 48 analyzed tissues in GTEx, 26 had variant co-expression clusters of four known highly expressed and pancreas-enriched genes (PRSS1, PNLIP, CLPS, and/or CELA3A). Fourteen additional highly expressed genes from other tissues also indicated contamination. Sample contamination by non-native genes was associated with a sample being sequenced on the same day as a tissue that natively expressed those genes. This was highly significant for pancreas and esophagus genes (linear model, p=9.5e-237 and p=5e-260 respectively). Nine SNPs in four genes shown to contaminate non-native tissues demonstrated allelic differences between DNA-based genotypes and contaminated sample RNA-based genotypes, validating the contamination. Low-level contamination affected 4,497 (39.6%) samples (defined as 10 PRSS1 TPM). It also led [&ge;] to eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 18 genes. We note this type of contamination occurs widely, impacting bulk and single cell data set analysis. In conclusion, highly expressed, tissue-enriched genes basally contaminate GTEx and other datasets impacting analyses. Awareness of this process is necessary to avoid assigning inaccurate importance to low-level gene expression in inappropriate tissues and cells.",
