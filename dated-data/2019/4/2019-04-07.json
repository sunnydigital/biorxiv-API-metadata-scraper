    "abstract": "Collagen is the most abundant secreted protein in vertebrates that persists throughout life without renewal. The unchanging nature of collagen contrasts with observed continued collagen synthesis throughout adulthood and with conventional transcriptional and translational homeostatic mechanisms that replace damaged proteins with new copies. Here we show circadian clock regulation of procollagen transport from ER-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-plasma membrane by sequential rhythmic expression of SEC61, TANGO1, PDE4D and VPS33B. The result is nocturnal procollagen synthesis and daytime collagen fibril assembly in mice. Rhythmic collagen degradation by CTSK maintains collagen homeostasis. This circadian cycle of collagen synthesis, assembly and degradation affects only a pool of newly-synthesized collagen whilst maintaining the persistent collagen network. Disabling the circadian clock causes collagen accumulation and abnormal fibrils in vivo. In conclusion, our study has identified a circadian clock mechanism of protein homeostasis in which a sacrificial pool of collagen is synthesized and removed to maintain tissue function.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive self-regulation can shape pain experience, but its effects on autonomic responses to painful events are unclear. In this study, participants (N = 41) deployed a cognitive strategy based on reappraisal and imagination to regulate pain up or down on different trials while skin conductance responses (SCR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) activity were recorded. Using a machine learning approach, we first developed stimulus-locked SCR and ECG physiological markers predictive of pain ratings. The physiological markers demonstrated high sensitivity and moderate specificity in predicting pain across two datasets, including an independent test dataset (N = 84). When we tested the markers on the cognitive self-regulation data, we found that cognitive self-regulation had significant impacts on both pain ratings and pain-related physiology in accordance with regulatory goals. These findings suggest that self-regulation can impact autonomic nervous system responses to painful stimuli and provide pain-related autonomic profiles for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Signalling by surface receptors often relies on tethered reactions whereby an enzyme bound to the cytoplasmic tail f a receptor catalyses reactions on substrates within reach. The overall length and stiffness of the receptor tail, the enzyme, and the substrate determine a biophysical parameter termed the molecular reach of the reaction. This parameter determines the probability that the receptor-tethered-enzyme will contact the substrate, in the volume proximal to the membrane, when separated by different distances within the membrane plane. Here, we develop particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion models to study the interplay between molecular reach and diffusion. We find that increasing the molecular reach can increase reaction efficacy when diffusion is slow, but when diffusion is fast, increasing molecular reach reduces reaction efficacy. This switching is lost if reactions are forced to take place within the 2D plasma membrane instead of the 3D volume proximal to it, or if molecules diffuse in 3D. We show results in the context of immune receptors (PD-1 dephosphorylating CD28), a standard opposing kinase-phosphatase reaction, and a minimal two-particle model. The work highlights the 3D nature of many 2D membrane-confined interactions, illustrating a role for molecular reach in controlling biochemical reactions.",

    "abstract": "Neurite outgrowth is an integrated whole cell process that represents the earliest steps in neuronal differentiation. We studied cannabinoid-1 receptor regulated neurite outgrowth to identify the different subcellular processes (SCPs) involved and how they come together to produce a whole cell response. We identified the genes that were differentially expressed after CB1 receptor stimulation. From the differentially expressed components we identified the SCPs involved and how the SCPs connect to one another both horizontally and vertically. We used these SCP networks to identify genes, which when knocked down would validate the involvement of the SCP in neurite outgrowth. We identified a varied list of SCPs including those involved in pyrimidine metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, mitochondrial transport function, mRNA splicing and stability in addition to those involved in membrane vesicle production, transport and fusion and microtubule dynamics. Overall these data and computational analyses show that the downstream SCPs required for neurite outgrowth are widely distributed and involve a range of normal cellular functions. Additionally, several of these processes can be considered distal in terms of their proximity to cell signaling pathways and the microtubule and membrane vesicle dynamics, the proximal SCPs required for neurite outgrowth. Hence we conclude that receptor regulation of neurite outgrowth is distributed and deep.",

    "abstract": "Many (re)emerging infectious diseases in humans arise from pathogen spillover from wildlife or livestock, and accurately predicting pathogen spillover is an important public health goal. In the Americas, yellow fever in humans primarily occurs following spillover from non-human primates via mosquitoes. Predicting yellow fever spillover can improve public health responses through vector control and mass vaccination. Here, we develop and test a mechanistic model of pathogen spillover to predict human risk for yellow fever in Brazil. Our environmental risk model, based on the ecology of mosquito vectors and non-human primate hosts, distinguished municipality-months with yellow fever spillover from 2001 to 2016 with high accuracy (AUC = 0.71). Incorporating hypothesized cyclical dynamics of infected primates improved accuracy (AUC = 0.79). Using boosted regression trees to identify gaps in the mechanistic model, we found that important predictors include current and lagged (mechanistic) environmental risk, vaccine coverage, population density, temperature, and precipitation. More broadly, we show that for a widespread human viral pathogen, the ecological interactions between environment, vectors, reservoir hosts, and humans can predict spillover with surprising accuracy, suggesting the potential to improve preventative action to reduce yellow fever spillover and prevent onward epidemics in humans.",

    "abstract": "The matrix protein M1 of the Influenza A virus is considered to mediate viral assembly and budding at the plasma membrane (PM) of infected cells. In order for a new viral particle to form, the PM lipid bilayer has to bend into a vesicle towards the extracellular side. Studies in cellular models have proposed that different viral proteins might be responsible for inducing membrane curvature in this context (including M1), but a clear consensus has not been reached. In this study, we use a combination of fluorescence microscopy, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (sFCS) to investigate M1-induced membrane deformation in biophysical models of the PM. Our results indicate that M1 is indeed capable to cause membrane curvature in lipid bilayers containing negatively-charged lipids, in the absence of other viral components. Furthermore, we prove that simple protein binding is not sufficient to induce membrane restructuring. Rather, it appears that stable M1-M1 interactions and multimer formation are required in order to alter the bilayer three-dimensional structure, through the formation of a protein scaffold. Finally, our results suggest that, in a physiological context, M1-induced membrane deformation might be modulated by the initial bilayer curvature and the lateral organization of membrane components (i.e. the presence of lipid domains).",

    "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry is the ultimate source of reducing power for phytoplankton primary productivity (PhytoPP). Single turnover active chlorophyll fluorometry (STAF) provides a non-intrusive method that has the potential to measure PhytoPP on much wider spatiotemporal scales than is possible with more direct methods such as 14C fixation and O2 evolved through water oxidation. Application of a STAF-derived absorption coefficient for PSII light-harvesting (aLHII) provides a method for estimating PSII photochemical flux on a unit volume basis (JVPII). Within this study, we assess potential errors in the calculation of JVPII arising from sources other than photochemically active PSII complexes (baseline fluorescence) and the package effect. Although our data show that such errors can be significant, we identify fluorescence-based correction procedures that can be used to minimize their impact. For baseline fluorescence, the correction incorporates an assumed consensus PSII photochemical efficiency for dark-adapted material. The error generated by the package effect can be minimized through the ratio of variable fluorescence measured within narrow wavebands centered at 730 nm, where the re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is minimal, and at 680 nm, where re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is maximal. We conclude that, with incorporation of these corrective steps, STAF can provide a reliable estimate of JVPII and, if used in conjunction with simultaneous satellite measurements of ocean color, could take us significantly closer to achieving the objective of obtaining reliable autonomous estimates of PhytoPP.",

    "abstract": "Many genome variants shaping mammalian phenotype are hypothesized to regulate gene transcription and/or to be under selection. However, most of the evidence to support this hypothesis comes from human studies. Systematic evidence for regulatory and evolutionary signals contributing to complex traits in a different mammalian model is needed. Sequence variants associated with gene expression (eQTLs) and concentration of metabolites (mQTLs), and under histone modification marks in several tissues were discovered from multi-omics data of over 400 cattle. Variants under selection and evolutionary constraint were identified using genome databases of multiple species. These analyses defined 30 sets of variants and for each set we estimated the genetic variance the set explained across 34 complex traits in 11,923 bulls and 32,347 cows with 17,669,372 imputed variants. The per-variant trait heritability of these sets across traits was highly consistent (r>0.94) between bulls and cows. Based on the per-variant heritability, conserved sites across 100 vertebrate species and mQTLs ranked the highest, followed by eQTLs, young variants, those under histone modification marks and selection signatures. From these results, we defined a Functional-And-Evolutionary Trait Heritability (FAETH) score indicating the functionality and predicted heritability of each variant. In 7,551 Danish cattle, the high FAETH-ranking variants had significantly increased genetic variances and genomic prediction accuracies in 3 production traits compared to the low FAETH-ranking variants. The FAETH framework combines the information of gene regulation, evolution and trait heritability to rank variants and the publicly available FAETH data provides a set of biological priors for cattle genomic selection worldwide.",

While the functions of most circRNAs are unknown, binding of microRNAs (miRNA), regulation of splicing and transcription, and translation into proteins have all been demonstrated for specific circRNAs. Virally-derived circRNAs have recently been described in gamma-herpesviruses. Here, we report that oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) generate circRNAs, including ones which encompass the entire coding region of the E7 oncogene (circE7). HPV16 circE7 can be detected by both inverse RT-PCR and Northern blots of HPV16-transformed cell lines. CircE7 is N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified, preferentially localized to the cytoplasm, and can be translated to produce E7 oncoprotein. Specific disruption of circE7 in CaSki cervical carcinoma cells decreased E7 protein levels, inhibited cell proliferation, and inhibited the ability of the cells to form colonies in soft agar. Analysis of TCGA RNA-seq data demonstrates that HPV-positive cancers have abundant circE7 RNAs. These results provide evidence that virally-derived, protein-encoding circular RNAs have biologically important functions with relevance to the transforming properties of HPV.",

    "abstract": "Inoculation of crop plants with PGPR has in a large number of investigations resulted in increased plant growth and yield both in the greenhouse and in the field. This plant growth promoting effect of bacteria could be due to net result of synergistic effect of various pgpr traits that they exert in the rhizosphere region of the plant. Four (04) bacterial strain of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. viz. P1, P17, P22 and P28 were identified previously for their plant growth promoting nature and abiotic stress tolerance and selected further to assess their chitinolytic activity and growth promotion on sorghum in combination with chitosans of low and high degree of acetylation. It was found that P1 has no chitin degrading nature and rest of the three strains have this property. When studied for their ability to grow in presence of chitosans of DA 1.6, 11, 35 and 56% all the strains showed growth in presence of chitosans. Seed bacterization of sorghum seeds with 04 bacterial strains in the presence and absence of chitosans (both low and high DA) and assessment of plant growth promotion after 15 days of sowing showed that P17+DA 56% chitosan combination showed higher growth of seedlings in plant growth chamber with highest root length of 25.9 cm, highest shoot length of 32.1 cm and dry mass of 132.7 mg/ plant. In P17+DA 56% chitosan treated seedlings various defence enzymes and PR-proteins were found to be present in highest quantities as compared to P1 and un-inoculated controls. Since this strain showed highest growth promotion of sorghum seedlings chitin-chitosan modifying enzyme (CCME) of this strain was partially characterized using different proteomic tools and techniques. CCME of P17 had one active polypeptide with a Pi in the range of 3.0-4.0. The digestion pattern of acetylated and deacetylated chitosans showed that P17 enzyme has endochitinase activity. Substrate specificity assay showed that the enzyme had more specificity towards highly acetylated chitosans. Two dimensional PAGE and MS analysis of the protein revealed similarities of this enzyme with protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa chitinase PA01 strain of GenBank. In conclusion, the study established the option of opening new possibilities for developing bacterial-chitosan (P17+DA 56% chitosan) product for plant growth promotion and induced systemic resistance in sorghum.",

The presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, termed amphistomy, increases photosynthetic rate, is common in plants from high light habitats, and rare otherwise. In this study I use optimality models based on leaf energy budget and photosynthetic models to ask why amphistomy is common in high light habitats. I developed an R package leafoptimizer to solve for stomatal traits that optimally balance carbon gain with water loss in a given environment. The model predicts that amphistomy is common in high light because its marginal effect on carbon gain is greater than in the shade, but only if the costs of amphistomy are also lower under high light than in the shade. More generally, covariation between costs and benefits may explain why stomatal and other traits form discrete phenotypic clusters.",

Here, we have found that murine and human follicular helper T (TFH) cells express higher levels of SCD1 compared to non-TFH cells. Further, the expression of SCD1 in TFH cells is dependent on the TFH lineage-specification transcription factor BCL6. We found that the inhibition of SCD1 impaired TFH cell maintenance and shifted the balance between TFH and follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells in the spleen. Consequently, SCD1 inhibition dampened germinal center B cell responses following influenza immunization. Mechanistically, we found that SCD inhibition led to increased ER stress and enhanced TFH cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "The biomechanical properties of Acacia tortilis were investigated considering its habitat (wild vs. nursery). The plant materials were collected from partially urbanized area in Doha city and from Qatar Foundation Nursery. The results show that Acacia grown in field are more flexible than those grown in nursery. Youngs Modulus of Elasticity was found to be 191 MPa and 617 MPa and the Flexural Modulus was found to be 49 MPa and 575 MPa and the breaking force was found to be 210 and 550 N for nursery and field Acacia, respectively. The deflection angle was measured using sensitive flex sensors connected to Arduino boards and was found to be higher for field Acacia (50{circ}). Image processing techniques were used to mathematically describe the branch motion versus time diagrams.\\n\\nThe plant part being investigated was covered with red tape and videotaped while subjected to a force causing it to bend. The stem was divided into 745 successive points and the change in their position with time taken frame by frame was converted into a change in position expressed through mathematical parameters. The bending movement of the branch was found to follow a power function H = (4001 - e0.06m).\\n\\nHighlightField grown Acacia have higher values of Youngs and Flexural Moduli than nursery grown ones thus conferring them more elasticity and flexibility.",

    "abstract": "The sulfur contents of fossil fuels has negative impacts on the environment and human health. The bio-catalytic desulfurization strategies and the biological refinement of the fossil fuels are a cost-effective process compared to chemical desulfurization. Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 is able to extract the organic sulfur of oil as mineral salts by 4S metabolic pathway (i.e. DszA,B,C and D genes). dszD gene codes a NADH:FMN oxidoreductase delivering reducing equivalent to DszA, DszB, and DszC to remove sulfur from heterocyclic molecules. In this study, we sought to improve DszD specificity by side-direct mutagenesis based on prediction of the DszD structure, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation. Accordingly, the cloning, expression and activity assay of best candidates (A79I and A79N) were performed. Our results demonstrated the important role of position 79 in enzyme activity, the A79I and A79N mutants are able to increase the enzyme activity 3.4 and 5.2 fold compared to wild-type.",

    "abstract": "Shortening of 3'UTRs (3'US) through alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a post-transcriptional mechanism that regulate expression of hundreds of genes in human cancers. In breast cancer, different subtypes of tumor samples, such as estrogen receptor positive and negative (ER+ and ER-), are characterized by distinct molecular mechanisms, suggesting possible differences in the post-transcriptional regulation between the subtype tumors. In this study, based on the profound tumorigenic role of 3'US interacting with competing-endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network (3'US-ceRNA effect), we hypothesize that the 3'US-ceRNA effect drives subtype-specific tumor growth. However, we found that the subtypes are available in different sample size, biasing the ceRNA network size and disabling the fair comparison of the 3'US-ceRNA effect. Using normalized Laplacian Matrix Eigenvalue Distribution, we addressed this bias and built the tumor ceRNA networks comparable between the subtypes. Based on the comparison, we identified a novel role of housekeeping (HK) genes as stable and strong miRNA sponges (sponge HK genes) that synchronize the ceRNA networks of normal samples (adjacent to ER+ and ER- tumor samples). We further found that distinct 3'US events in the ER- tumor break the stable sponge effect of HK genes in a subtype-specific fashion, especially in association with the aggressive and metastatic phenotypes. Knockdown of NUDT21, a master 3'-UTR regulator in HeLa cells, confirmed the causal role of 3'US-ceRNA effect repressing HK genes for tumor growth. In this study, we identified 3'US-ceRNA effect on the sponge HK genes for subtype-specific growth of ER- tumors.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic human pathogen and the cause of biofilm-associated infections of the heart, catheterized urinary tract, wounds, and the dysbiotic gut where it can expand to high numbers upon microbiome perturbations. The E. faecalis sortase-assembled endocarditis and biofilm associated pilus (Ebp) is involved in adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo. Extracellular electron transfer (EET) also promotes E. faecalis biofilm formation in iron-rich environments, however neither the mechanism underlying EET nor its role in virulence was previously known. Here we show that iron associated with Ebp serve as a terminal electron acceptor for EET, leading to extracellular iron reduction and intracellular iron accumulation. We found that a MIDAS motif within the EbpA tip adhesin is required for interaction with iron, EET, and FeoB-mediated iron uptake. We demonstrate that MenB and Ndh3, essential components of the aerobic respiratory chain and a specialized flavin-mediated electron transport chain, respectively, are required for iron-mediated EET. In addition, using a mouse gastrointestinal (GI) colonization model, we show that EET is essential for colonization of the GI tract, and Ebp is essential for augmented E. faecalis GI colonization when dietary iron is in excess. Taken together, our findings show that pilus mediated capture of iron within biofilms enables EET-mediated iron acquisition in E. faecalis, and that these processes plays an important role in E. faecalis expansion in the GI tract.\\n\\nSignificanceUnderstanding enterococcal biofilm development is the first step towards improved therapeutics for the often antimicrobial resistant infections caused by these bacteria. Here we report a role for Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis and biofilm associated pili (Ebp) in mediating iron-dependent biofilm growth and contributing to extracellular electron transfer (EET) which in turn promotes iron acquisition. Furthermore, we characterize the mechanisms underlying electron transfer in the E. faecalis biofilm. Our findings support a model in which E. faecalis use EET to drive the reduction of pilus-associated ferric iron, leading to iron acquisition in E. faecalis biofilm, and contributing to enterococcal virulence in the GI tract.",

While specific traits are often recognized to influence establishment success of non-indigenous species, the impact of the associated microbial community for the fitness, performance and invasion success of basal marine metazoans remains vastly unknown. In this study we compared the microbiota community composition of the invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in different native and invasive sub-populations along with characterization of the genetic structure of the host. By 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing we showed that the sister group to all metazoans, namely ctenophores, harbored a distinct microbiota on the animal host, which significantly differed across two major tissues, namely epidermis and gastrodermis. Additionally, we identified significant differences between native and invasive sub-populations of M. leidyi, which indicate, that the microbiota community is likely influenced by the genotypic background of the ctenophore. To test the hypothesis that the microbiota is genotypically selected for by the ctenophore host, experiments under controlled environments are required.",

    "abstract": "Capsid proteins often present a positively charged arginine-rich region at the N and/or C-termini that for some icosahedral viruses has a fundamental role in genome packaging and particle stability. These sequences show little to no conservation at the amino-acid level and are structurally dynamic so that they cannot be easily detected by common sequence or structure comparison. As a result, the occurrence and distribution of positively charged protein domain across the viral and the overall protein universe are unknown. We developed a methodology based on the net charge calculation of discrete segments of the protein sequence that allows us to identify proteins containing amino-acid stretches with an extremely high net charge. We observed that among all organisms, icosahedral viruses are especially enriched in extremely positively charged segments (Q [&ge;] +17), with a distinctive bias towards arginine instead of lysine. We used viral particle structural data to calculate the total electrostatic charge derived from the most positively charged protein segment of capsid proteins and correlated these values with genome charge arising from the phosphates of each nucleotide. We obtained a positive correlation (r = 0.91, p-value < 0001) for a group of 17 viral families, corresponding to 40% of all families with icosahedral structures described so far. These data indicated that unrelated viruses with diverse genome types adopt a common underlying mechanism for capsid assembly and genome stabilization based on R-arms. Outliers from a linear fit pointed to families with alternative strategies of capsid assembly and genome packaging.\\n\\nSignificance StatementViruses can be characterized by the existence of a capsid, an intricate proteinaceous container that encases the viral genome. Therefore, capsid assembly and function are essential to viral replication. Here we specify virus families with diverse capsid structure and sequence, for each capsid packing capacity depends on a distinctive structural feature: a highly positively charged segment of amino acids residues, preferentially made of arginine. We also show that proteins with the same characteristics are rarely found in cellular proteins. Therefore, we identified a conserved viral functional element that can be used to infer capsid assembly mechanisms and inspire the design of protein nanoparticles and broad-spectrum antiviral treatments.",

    "abstract": "In the clinical setting, exome sequencing has become standard-of-care in diagnosing rare genetic disorders, however many patients remain unsolved. Trio sequencing has been demonstrated to produce a higher diagnostic yield than singleton (proband-only) sequencing. Parental sequencing is especially useful when a disease is suspected to be caused by a de novo variant in the proband, because parental data provide a strong filter for the majority of variants that are shared by the proband and their parents. However the additional cost of sequencing the parents makes the trio strategy uneconomical for many clinical situations. With two thirds of the sequencing budget being spent on parents, these are funds that could be used to sequence more probands. For this reason many clinics are reluctant to sequence parents.\\n\\nHere we propose a pooled-parent strategy for exome sequencing of individuals with likely de novo disease. In this strategy, DNA from all the parents of a cohort of unrelated probands is pooled together into a single exome capture and sequencing run. Variants called in the proband can then be filtered if they are also found in the parent pool, resulting in a shorter list of prioritised variants. To evaluate the pooled-parent strategy we performed a series of simulations by combining reads from individual exomes to imitate sample pooling. We assessed the recall and false positive rate and investigated the trade-off between pool size and recall rate. We compared the performance of GATK HaplotypeCaller individual and joint calling, and FreeBayes to genotype pooled samples. Finally, we applied a pooled-parent strategy to a set of real unsolved cases and showed that the parent pool is a powerful filter that is complementary to other commonly used variant filters such as population variant frequencies.",

Since solubility measurements are time-consuming and expensive, there is a strong need for solubility prediction tools.\\n\\nResultsWe have recently introduced solubility-dependent distance potentials that are able to unravel the role of residue-residue interactions in promoting or decreasing protein solubility. Here, we extended their construction by defining solubility-dependent potentials based on backbone torsion angles and solvent accessibility, and integrated them, together with other structure- and sequence-based features, into a random forest model trained on a set of E. coli proteins with experimental structures and solubility values. We thus obtained the SOLart protein solubility predictor, whose most informative features turned out to be folding free energy differences computed from our solubility-dependent statistical potentials. SOLart performances are very good, with a Pearson correlation coefficient between experimental and predicted solubility values of 0.7 both in the training dataset and on an independent set of S. Cerevisiae proteins. On test sets of modeled structures, only a limited drop in performance is observed. SOLart can thus be used with both high-resolution and low-resolution structures, and clearly outperforms state-of-art solubility predictors. It is available through a user-friendly webserver, which is easy to use by non-expert scientists.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe SOLart webserver is freely available at babylone.ulb.ac.be/SOLART/",

However, the combinatorial explosion of possible genetic interactions (GIs) has necessitated the use of scalar interaction readouts (e.g. growth) that conflate diverse outcomes. Here we present an analytical framework for interpreting manifolds constructed from high-dimensional interaction phenotypes. We applied this framework to rich phenotypes obtained by Perturb-seq (single-cell RNA-seq pooled CRISPR screens) profiling of strong GIs mined from a growth-based, gain-of-function GI map. Exploration of this manifold enabled ordering of regulatory pathways, principled classification of GIs (e.g. identifying true suppressors), and mechanistic elucidation of synthetic lethal interactions, including an unexpected synergy between CBL and CNN1 driving erythroid differentiation. Finally, we apply recommender system machine learning to predict interactions, facilitating exploration of vastly larger GI manifolds.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPrinciples and mechanisms of genetic interactions are revealed by rich phenotyping using single-cell RNA sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Jupyter Notebooks [4, 6] provide executable documents (in a variety of programming languages) that can be run in a web browser. When a notebook contains graphical widgets, it becomes an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). Many scientific simulation packages use text-based configuration files to provide parameter values and run at the command line without a graphical interface. Manually editing these files to explore how different values affect a simulation can be burdensome for technical users, and impossible to use for those with other scientific backgrounds. xml2jupyter is a Python package that addresses these scientific bottlenecks. It provides a mapping between configuration files, formatted in the Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Jupyter widgets. Widgets are automatically generated from the XML file and these can, optionally, be incorporated into a larger GUI for a simulation package, and optionally hosted on cloud resources. Users modify parameter values via the widgets, and the values are written to the XML configuration file which is input to the simulations command-line interface. xml2jupyter has been tested using PhysiCell [1], an open source, agent-based simulator for biology, and it is being used by students for classroom and research projects. In addition, we use xml2jupyter to help create Jupyter GUIs for PhysiCell-related applications running on nanoHUB [5].",

    "abstract": "We studied the phylogeny, biogeography and diversification of suboscine birds in the genus Scytalopus (Rhinocryptidae), a widespread, speciose, and taxonomically challenging group of Neotropical birds. We analyzed nuclear (exons, regions flanking ultraconserved elements) and mitochondrial (ND2) DNA sequence data for a taxonomically and geographically comprehensive sample of specimens collected from Costa Rica to Patagonia and eastern Brazil. We found that Scytalopus is a monophyletic group sister to Eugralla, and consists of three main clades roughly distributed in (1) the Southern Andes, (2) eastern Brazil, and (3) the Tropical Andes and Central America. The clades from the Southern Andes and Eastern Brazil are sister to each other. Despite their confusing overall uniformity in plumage coloration, body shape and overall appearance, rates of species accumulation through time in Scytalopus since the origin of the clade in the Late Miocene are unusually high compared to those of other birds, suggesting rapid non-adaptive diversification in the group which we attribute to their limited dispersal abilities making them speciation-prone and their occurrence in a complex landscape with numerous barriers promoting allopatric differentiation. Divergence times among species and downturns in species accumulation rates in recent times suggest that most speciation events in Scytalopus predate climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene. Our analyses identified various cases of strong genetic structure within species and lack of monophyly of taxa, flagging populations which likely merit additional study to establish their taxonomic status. In particular, detailed analyses of species limits are due in S. parvirostris, S. latrans, S. speluncae, the S. atratus complex, and the Southern Andes clade.",

However, the molecular machinery underlying these hierarchically organized chromatin architecture and dynamics remains poorly understood. Here by combining imaging and Hi-C sequencing, we studied the role of lamin B1 in chromatin architecture and dynamics. We found that lamin B1 depletion leads to chromatin redistribution and decompaction. Consequently, the inter-chromosomal interactions and overlap between chromosome territories are increased. Moreover, Hi-C data revealed that lamin B1 is required for the integrity and segregation of chromatin compartments but not for the topologically associating domains (TADs). We further proved that depletion of lamin B1 leads to increased chromatin dynamics, owing to chromatin decompaction and redistribution toward nuclear interior. Taken together, our data suggest that chromatin-lamin B1 interactions promote chromosomal territory segregation and genomic compartmentalization, and confine chromatin dynamics, supporting its crucial role in chromatin higher-order structure and dynamics.",

The regulators that control monocyte tissue adaptation in the gut remain poorly understood. Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor previously shown to play a key role in maintaining the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages. Here we investigate the impact of IRF5 on the MNP system and physiology of the gut at homeostasis and during inflammation. We demonstrate that IRF5 deficiency has a limited impact on colon physiology at steady state, but ameliorates immunopathology during Helicobacter hepaticus induced colitis. Inhibition of IRF5 activity in MNPs phenocopies global IRF5 deficiency. Using a combination of bone marrow chimera and single cell RNA-sequencing approaches we compare the differentiation trajectories of wild type and IRF5 deficient monocytes in a shared inflammatory environment and demonstrate that IRF5 stipulates a choice in monocyte differentiation towards macrophages. Specifically, IRF5 promotes the generation of pathogenic CD11c+ macrophages and controls the production of inflammatory mediators by these cells. Thus, we identify IRF5 as a key transcriptional controller of pathogenic monocyte differentiation in the gut.",

Although it plays a critical role in bacterial survival, its architecture is not well understood. Herein, we visualized the architecture of the peptidoglycan surface in Bacillus subtilis at the nanometer resolution, using quick-freeze, deep-etch electron microscopy. Filamentous structures were observed on the entire surface of the cell, where filaments about 11-nm wide formed concentric circles on cell poles, filaments about 13-nm wide formed a circumferential mesh-like structure on the cylindrical part, and a \\\"piecrust\\\" structure was observed at the boundary. When growing cells were treated with lysozyme, the entire cell mass migrated to one side and came out from the cell envelope. Fluorescence labeling showed that lysozyme preferentially bound to a cell pole and cell division site, where the peptidoglycan synthesis was not complete. Ruffling of surface structures was observed during electron microscopy. When cells were treated with penicillin, the cell mass came out from a cleft around the cell division site. Outward curvature of the protoplast at the cleft seen using electron microscopy suggested that turgor pressure was applied as the peptidoglycan was not damaged at other positions. When muropeptides were depleted, surface filaments were lost while the rod shape of the cell was maintained. These changes can be explained on the basis of the working points of the chemical structure of peptidoglycan.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria with multi-replicon genome organizations, including members of the family Rhizobiaceae, often carry a variety of niche-associated functions on large plasmids. While evidence exists for cross-replicon interactions and co-evolution between replicons in many of these systems, remarkable strain-to-strain variation is also observed for extrachromosomal elements, suggesting increased genetic plasticity. Here, we show that curing of the tumor-inducing virulence plasmid (pTi) of an octopine-type Agrobacterium tumefaciens lineage leads to a large deletion in the co-resident At megaplasmid (pAt). The deletion event is mediated by a repetitive IS-element, IS66, and results in a variety of environment-dependent fitness consequences, including loss of independent conjugal transfer of the plasmid. Interestingly, a related and otherwise wild-type A. tumefaciens strain is missing exactly the same large pAt segment as the pAt deletion derivatives, suggesting a similar event over its natural history. Overall, the findings presented here uncover a novel genetic interaction between the two large plasmids of A. tumefaciens and provide evidence for cross-replicon integration and co-evolution of these plasmids.",

Recent studies suggest transmodal brain networks are especially sensitive to aging, which, we hypothesise, may be due to their apical position in the cortical hierarchy. Studying an open-access healthy cohort (n=102, age range = 30-89 years) with MRI and A{beta} PET data, we estimated age-related cortical thinning, hippocampal atrophy and A{beta} deposition. In addition to carrying out surface-based morphological and metabolic mapping, we stratified effects along neocortical and hippocampal resting-state functional connectome gradients derived from independent datasets. The cortical gradient depicts an axis of functional differentiation from sensory-motor regions to transmodal regions, whereas the hippocampal gradient recapitulates its long-axis. While age-related thinning and increased A{beta} deposition occurred across the entire cortical topography, increased A{beta} deposition was especially pronounced towards higher-order transmodal regions. Age-related atrophy was greater towards the posterior end of the hippocampal long-axis. No significant effect of age on A{beta} deposition in the hippocampus was observed. Imaging markers correlated with behavioural measures of fluid intelligence and episodic memory in a topography-specific manner. Our results strengthen existing evidence of structural and metabolic change in the aging brain and support the use of connectivity gradients as a compact framework to analyse and conceptualize brain-based biomarkers of aging.",

    "abstract": "Making targeted gene deletions is essential for studying organisms, but is difficult in many prokaryotes due to the inefficiency of homologous recombination based methods. Here, I describe an easily modifiable, single-plasmid system that can be used to make rapid, sequence targeted, markerless knockouts in both a Gram-negative and a Gram-positive organism. The system is comprised of targeted DNA cleavage by Cas9 and error-prone repair by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) proteins. I confirm previous results showing that Cas9 and NHEJ can make knockouts when NHEJ is expressed before Cas9. Then, I show that Cas9 and NHEJ can be used to make knockouts when expressed simultaneously. I term the new method Potentially Organism-Agnostic Knockout (POAK) system and characterize its function in Escherichia coli and Weissella confusa. First, I develop a novel transformation protocol for W. confusa. Next, I show that, as in E. coli, POAK can create knockouts in W. confusa. Characterization of knockout efficiency across galK in both E. coli and W. confusa showed that while all gRNAs are effective in E. coli, only some gRNAs are effective in W. confusa, and cut site position within a gene does not determine knockout efficiency for either organism. I examine the sequences of knockouts in both organisms and show that POAK produces similar edits in both E. coli and W. confusa. Finally, as an example of the importance of being able to make knockouts quickly, I target W. confusa sugar metabolism genes to show that two sugar importers are not necessary for metabolism of their respective sugars. Having demonstrated that simultaneous expression of Cas9 and NHEJ is sufficient for making knockouts in two minimally related bacteria, POAK represents a hopeful avenue for making knockouts in other under-utilized bacteria.",

Object colour solids represent the colour gamut of reflective materials for an eye. The geometry of colour solids reveals general relationships between colours and object properties which can explain why certain colours are significant to animals and evolve as signals. We define a measure of colour vividness, such that points on the surface are maximally vivid and the  grey centre is minimally vivid. We show that a vivid colour for one animal is likely to vivid for others, and highly vivid colours are less easily mimicked than less vivid colours. Further, vivid colours such as black, white, red, blue and light, unsaturated shades are produced pure or orderly materials. This kind of material needs to created and maintained against entropic processes that would otherwise degrade or destroy them. Vivid coloration is therefore indicative of ecological affordance or biological function, so that it is valuable to have attentional biases towards these colours regardless of any specific significance.",

Here, we demonstrate that hepatic progenitor cells can be obtained from human infant hepatocytes using the same strategy. These cells, named human chemically induced liver progenitors (hCLiPs), had a significant repopulative capacity in injured mouse livers following transplantation. hCLiPs redifferentiated into mature hepatocytes in vitro upon treatment with hepatic maturation-inducing factors. These redifferentiated cells exhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymatic activities in response to CYP-inducing molecules and these activities were comparable with those in primary human hepatocytes.

    "abstract": "Phylogenomics seeks to use next-generation data to robustly infer an organisms evolutionary history. Yet, the practical caveats of phylogenomics motivates investigation of improved efficiency, particularly when quality of phylogenies are questionable. To achieve improvements, one goal is to maintain or enhance the quality of phylogenetic inference while severely reducing dataset size. We approach this goal by designing an optimized subsample of data with an experimental design whose results are determined on the basis of phylogenetic synecdoche - a comparison of phylogenies inferred from a subsample to phylogenies inferred from the entire dataset. We examine locus mutation rate, saturation, evolutionary divergence, rate heterogeneity, selection, and a priori information content as traits that may determine optimality. Our controlled experimental design is based on 265 loci for 102 blaberoidean cockroaches and 22 outgroup species. High phylogenetic utility is demonstrated by loci with high mutation rate, low saturation, low sequence distance, low rate heterogeneity, and low selection. We found that some phylogenetic information content estimators may not be meaningful for assessing information content a priori. We use these findings to design concatenated datasets with an optimized subsample of 100 loci. The tree inferred from the optimized subsample alignment was largely identical to that inferred from all 265 loci but with less evidence of long branch attraction and improved statistical support. In sum, optimized subsampling can improve tree quality while reducing data collection costs and yielding 4-6x improvements to computation time in tree inference and bootstrapping.",

Using a newly developed statistical framework called Sherlock-II that integrates GWAS with eQTL (expression Quantitative Trait Loci) and metabolite-QTL data, we systematically analyzed 445 GWAS datasets, and identified 1371 significant gene-phenotype associations and 308 metabolites-phenotype associations (passing a Q value cutoff of 1/3). This integrative analysis allows us to translate SNP-phenotype associations into functionally informative gene-phenotype association profiles. Genetic similarity analyses based on these profiles clustered phenotypes into sub-trees that reveal both expected and unexpected relationships. We employed a statistical approach to delineate sets of functionally related genes that contribute to the similarity between their association profiles. This approach suggested common molecular mechanisms that connect the phenotypes in a subtree. For example, we found that fasting insulin, fasting glucose, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer clustered into a subtree, and identified cyclic AMP/GMP signaling that connects breast cancer and insulin, NAPDH oxidase/ROS generation that connects the three cancers, and apoptosis that connects all five phenotypes. Our approach can be used to assess genetic similarity and suggest mechanistic connections between phenotypes. It has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of a disease by mapping mechanistic insights from one phenotype onto others based on common molecular underpinnings.",

    "abstract": "Although psychiatric phenotypes are hypothesized to organize into a two-factor internalizing - externalizing structure, few studies have evaluated the structure of psychopathology in older adults, nor explored whether genome-wide polygenic scores (PGSs) are associated with psychopathology in a domain-specific manner. We used data from 6,216 individuals of European ancestry from the Health and Retirement Study, a large population-based sample of older adults in the United States. Confirmatory factor analyses were applied to validated measures of psychopathology and PGSs were derived from well-powered GWAS. Genomic SEM was implemented to construct latent PGSs for internalizing, externalizing, and general psychopathology. Phenotypically, the data were best characterized by a single general factor of psychopathology, a factor structure that was replicated across genders and age groups. Although externalizing PGSs (cannabis use, antisocial behavior, alcohol dependence, ADHD) were not associated with any phenotypes, PGSs for MDD, neuroticism, and anxiety disorders were associated with both internalizing and externalizing phenotypes. Moreover, the latent internalizing PGS and the latent one-factor PGS, derived using weights from Genomic SEM, explained 1% more variance in the general factor of psychopathology than any of the individual PGSs. Results support the following conclusions: genetic risk factors for and phenotypic markers of psychiatric disorders are transdiagnostic in European ancestries, GWAS-derived PGSs fail to capture genetic variation associated with disease specificity in European ancestries, and blunt phenotypic measurement in GWAS may preclude our ability to evaluate the structure and specificity of genetic contributions to psychiatric disorders.",

To assess the association, we compared the microbiome of clinical mastitis (CM) and healthy (H) milk samples through whole metagenomic deep sequencing.

We observed distinct shifts and differences in abundance between the microbiome of CM and H milk in phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with an inclusion of 68.04% unreported and/or opportunistic species in CM milk. Additionally, 14 archaeal and 14 viral genera were found to be solely associated with CM. The functional metagenomics identified several pathways related to bacterial proliferation and colonization such as metabolism, chemotaxis and invasion, immune-diseases, oxidative stress, regulation and cell signaling, phage and prophases, antibiotic and heavy metal resistance to be associated with CM. Therefore, the present study provides conclusive data on milk microbiome diversity associated with bovine CM and its role in udder health.",

Point of care diagnosis is one of the diagnostic aspects in the health care system that might have the potential to mitigate this worldwide epidemic.

Smooth sample preparation and streamlined DNA extraction constitute the biggest challenges for this limitation.\\n\\nMethodsSeventeen M. tuberculosis samples which were already previously analyzed by GeneXpert or culture technique were subjected to our in-house protocol. Of these samples, ten were positive and seven negatives when tested by GeneXpert, while seven were positive and ten negatives when analyzed by culturing.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a \\\"proof of concept\\\" protocol for sputum liquefaction and disinfection, followed by FTA card DNA extraction. The resulting DNA is rapidly amplified and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA is detected with the use of a portable qPCR instrument. Our protocol is able to linearly identify down to 2 CFU/mL of MTB, showing great sensitivity on artificial samples. The protocol was challenged with patient samples, and showed excellent agreement with the gold-standard molecular protocol, allowing the detection of 9/10 positive samples (90%, or 10% of false negatives) and 7/7 of the negative (100%, no false positives). When compared to culture, 7/7 culture-positive samples were also found positive (100%, no false negatives), while 2/10 culture-negative were found positive by the present method (20% of false positives).\\n\\nConclusionThe proposed sample preparation protocol provides a rapid and easy procedure with a small number of reagents and steps, as well as minimal use of equipments, resulting in an easy-to-use tool for M. tuberculosis diagnosis in POC settings.",

Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies published from 2008 to 2019, which reported at least two statistically derived clusters or trajectories were included. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted the data.\n\nResultsOf 2,285 studies retrieved, 50 studies (17 longitudinal and 33 cross-sectional) conducted in 30 countries were selected for review. Longitudinal studies discovered two to five trajectories of positive and negative symptoms in patient, and four to five trajectories of cognitive deficits in patient and sibling. In cross-sectional studies, three clusters of positive and negative symptoms in patient, four clusters of positive and negative schizotypy in sibling, and three to five clusters of cognitive deficits in patient and sibling were identified. These studies also reported multidimensional predictors of clusters and trajectories.\n\nConclusionsOur findings indicate that (sub)clinical symptoms of schizophrenia are more heterogeneous than currently recognized.

    "abstract": "Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\n\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains.

    "abstract": "Measuring animal behavior in the context of experimental manipulation is critical for modeling and understanding neuro-psychiatric disease. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response (PPI) is a behavioral paradigm used extensively for this purpose, but the results of PPI studies are often inconsistent. As a result, the utility of this metric remains uncertain. Here we deconstruct the phenomenon of PPI. We first confirm several limitations of the traditional PPI metric, including that the underlying startle response has a non-Gaussian distribution and that the traditional PPI metric changes with different stimulus condition. We then develop a novel model that reveals PPI to be a combination of the previously appreciated scaling of the startle response, as well as a scaling of sound perception. Using our model, we find no evidence for differences in PPI in a rat model of Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) compared to wild-type controls. These results in the rat provide a reliable methodology that could be used to clarify inconsistent PPI results in mice and humans. In addition, we find robust differences between wild-type male and female rats. Our model allows us to understand the nature of these differences, and we find that both the startle-scaling and sound-scaling components of PPI are a function of the baseline startle response. Males and females differ specifically in the startle-scaling, but not the sound-scaling, component of PPI. These findings establish a robust experimental and analytical approach that has the potential to provide a consistent biomarker of brain function.",

More recently, several groups reported that ARCH is driven by somatic mutations. The most prevalent ARCH mutations are in the DNMT3A and TET2 genes, previously described as drivers of myeloid malignancies. ARCH is associated with an increased risk for haematological cancers. ARCH also confers an increased risk for non-haematological diseases such as cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and chronic ischemic heart failure, for which age is a main risk factor. Whether ARCH is linked to accelerated ageing has remained unexplored. The most accurate and commonly-used tools to measure age acceleration are epigenetic clocks. They are based on age-related methylation differences at specific CpG sites correlating chronological age accurately with epigenetic age. Deviations from chronological age towards an increased epigenetic age have been associated with increased risk of earlier mortality and age-related morbidities. Here we present evidence of accelerated epigenetic age in individuals with ARCH.",

    "abstract": "Motivation can be defined as the amount of energy an animal puts into actions to achieve goals. This not a static property but can be learned. Recently, abstract models have been developed for this kind of learning which propose that tonic dopamine is responsible to energise behaviour. However the underlying circuitry is still not understood and it is still unclear how tonic dopamine acts on the motor system to energise behaviour. In this paper we present a limbic system model of response invigoration which is based on neurophysiological data and anatomical connections. We argue that the indirect pathway from NAcc core D2 neurons via the ventral pallidum to the SNr conveys response vigour, while the direct pathway from NAcc core D1 neurons is responsible for action selection. Once this detailed anatomically mapped circuit has been established we then condense this realistic model into an abstract model which then shows that tonic DA acts in a multiplicative way on the motor output and thus is able to energise behaviour. We demonstrate the model with both a simulated and real robot experiment.",

    "abstract": "A core goal of visual neuroscience is to predict human perceptual performance from natural signals. Performance in any natural task can be impacted by at least three sources of uncertainty: stimulus variability, internal noise, and sub-optimal computations. Determining the relative importance of these factors has been a focus of interest for decades, but most successes have been achieved with simple tasks and simple stimuli. Drawing quantitative links directly from natural signals to perceptual performance has proven a substantial challenge. Here, we develop an image-computable (pixels in, estimates out) Bayesian ideal observer that makes optimal use of the statistics relating image movies to speed. The optimal computations bear striking resemblance to descriptive models proposed to account for neural activity in area MT. We develop a model based on the ideal, stimulate it with naturalistic signals, predict the behavioral signatures of each performance-limiting factor, and test the predictions in an interlocking series of speed discrimination experiments. The critical experiment collects human responses to repeated presentations of each unique image movie. The model, highly constrained by the earlier experiments, tightly predicts human response consistency without free parameters. This result implies that human observers use near-optimal computations to estimate speed, and that human performance is near-exclusively limited by natural stimulus variability and internal noise. The results demonstrate that human performance can be predicted from a task-specific statistical analysis of naturalistic stimuli, show that image-computable ideal observer analysis can be generalized from simple to natural stimuli, and encourage similar analyses in other domains.",

Despite their importance, we know far less about the response of bacteria to human-induced environmental change than we do about other organisms. Understanding the response of organisms to land use change is especially pressing for tropical rainforests, which are being altered at a higher rate than any other ecosystem. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies performed in each of the major tropical rainforest regions to ask whether there are consistent responses of belowground bacterial communities to the conversion of tropical rainforest to agriculture. Remarkably, we find common responses despite wide variation across studies in the types of agriculture practiced and the research methodology used to study land use change. These responses include changes in the relative abundance of phyla, most notably decreases in Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria and increases in Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes. We also find that alpha diversity (at the scale of single soil cores), consistently increases with ecosystem conversion. These consistent responses suggest that, while there is great diversity in agricultural practices across the tropics, common features such as the use of slash-and-burn tactics have the potential to alter bacterial community composition and diversity belowground.",

Recognition of true indels is of prime importance in many applications, such as, personalized health care, disease genomics, population genetics etc. Recently, advanced machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to classification problems with large-scale data. In this paper, we present SICaRiO, a gradient boosting classifier for reliable detection of true indels, trained with gold-standard dataset from genome-in-a-bottle (GIAB) consortium. Our filtering scheme significantly improves the performance of each variant calling pipeline used in GIAB and beyond. SICaRiO uses genomic features which can be computed from publicly available resources, hence, we can apply it on any indel callsets not having sequencing pipeline-specific information (e.g., read depth). This study also sheds lights on prior genomic contexts responsible for indel calling error made by sequencing platforms. We have compared prediction difficulty for three indel categories over different sequencing pipelines. We have also ranked genomic features according to their predictivity in determining false indel calls.",

    "abstract": "Single and collective cell dynamics, cell shape changes, and cell migration can be conveniently represented by the Cellular Potts Model, a computational platform based on minimization of a Hamiltonian while permitting stochastic fluctuations. Using the fact that a force field is easily derived from a scalar energy (F = -{nabla}H), we develop a simple algorithm to associate effective forces with cell shapes in the CPM. We display the predicted forces for single cells of various shapes and sizes (relative to cell rest-area and cell rest-perimeter). While CPM forces are specified directly from the Hamiltonian on the cell perimeter, we infer internal forces using interpolation, and refine the results with smoothing. Predicted forces compare favorably with experimentally measured cellular traction forces. We show that a CPM model with internal signaling (such as Rho-GTPase-related contractility) can be associated with retraction-protrusion forces that accompany cell shape changes and migration. We adapt the computations to multicellular systems, showing, for example, the forces that a pair of swirling cells exert on one another, demonstrating that our algorithm works equally well for interacting cells. Finally, we show forces associated with the dynamics of classic cell-sorting experiments in larger clusters of model cells.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCells exert forces on their surroundings and on one another. In simulations of cell shape using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), the dynamics of deforming cell shapes is traditionally represented by an energy-minimization method. We use this CPM energy, the Hamiltonian, to derive and visualize the corresponding forces exerted by the cells. We use the fact that force is the negative gradient of energy to assign forces to the CPM cell edges, and then extend the results to interior forces by interpolation. We show that this method works for single as well as multiple interacting model cells, both static and motile. Finally, we show favorable comparison between predicted forces and real forces measured experimentally.",

    "abstract": "The heterospecific termite-termite cohabitation in a single termitarium, so called in-quilinism, is a common event whose basal mechanisms remain hypothetical. While some termite hosts have plenty of inquilines, others house only a few. Among these, Constrictotermes cyphergaster are frequently found cohabiting with a single obligate inquiline species but have been unknown to house any facultative inquilines. Here we present the first record of facultative inquilines (Embiratermes festivellus, Nasutitermes kemneri, Obitusitermes bacchanalis and Subulitermes) to this host, evidencing that this was unlikely to have happened fortuitously. In an attempt to pose hypotheses on the mechanisms behind such invasions, we explored likely connections between the settlement of obligate and facultative inquilines and nest walls physical traits. We found that nests bearing atypical external walls (moist, eroded, and partially covered by mosses) held higher richness of facultative inquilines than nests presenting walls void of such traits ({chi}2 = 8.3965, 1 df, n = 17, P = 0.0038). The presence of healthy host colonies in all nests, including the atypical ones, reinforces the hypothesis that the settlement of these facultative inquilines depends less on host colonies biotic status and more on abiotic features associated to the nest. In addition, the presence of obligate inquilines was not affected by the nest wall status ({chi}2 = 8.3965, 1 df, n = 17, P = 0.0038), implying that invasion by facultative and obligate inquilines in these nests would obey distinct restrictions. While warning that these hypotheses require further testing, we suggest that their understanding could shed light on the determinants of cohabitation not only in C. cyphergaster but in termites in general. cohabitation interspecific interaction nest invasion barriers",

    "abstract": "AbstractWild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, WEW) was shown to exhibit high grain protein content (GPC) and therefore, possess a great potential for improvement of cultivated wheat nutritional value. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between T. durum var. Svevo and WEW acc. Y12-3 was used for construction of a high-density genetic map and genetic dissection of GPC. Genotyping of 208 F6 RILs with 15K wheat SNP array yielded 4,166 polymorphic SNP markers, of which 1,510 were designated as skeleton markers. A total map length of 2,169 cM was obtained with an average distance of 1.5 cM between SNPs. A total of 12 GPC QTLs with LOD score range of 2.7-35.9, and PEV of 2.6-26.6% were identified under five environments. Major QTLs with favorable alleles from WEW were identified on chromosomes 4BS, 5AS, 6BS and 7BL. The QTL region on 6BS coincided with the physical position of the previously cloned QTL, Gpc-B1. Comparisons of the physical intervals of the GPC QTLs described here with the results previously reported in other durumxWEW RIL population led to the identification of four common and two homoeologous QTLs. Exploration of the large genetic variation within WEW accessions is a precondition for discovery of exotic beneficial alleles, as we have demonstrated here, by the identification of seven novel GPC QTLs. Therefore, our research emphasizes the importance of GPC QTL dissection in diverse WEW accessions as a source of novel alleles for improvement of GPC in cultivated wheat.\\n\\nKey messageGenetic dissection of GPC in tetraploid durum x WEW RIL population, based on high-density SNP genetic map, revealed 12 QTLs, with favorable WEW allele for 11 QTLs.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal transfer of plasmids plays a pivotal role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Sequencing of plasmids is thus paramount for the success of accurate epidemiological tracking strategies in the hospital setting and routine surveillance. Here, we combine Nanopore and Illumina sequencing to fully assemble a carbapenemase-encoding megaplasmid carried by a clinical isolate belonging to a putative novel Pseudomonas species. FFUP_PS_41 has a multidrug resistance phenotype and was initially identified as Pseudomonas putida, but an average nucleotide identity below the cut-off for species delineation suggests a new species related to the P. putida phylogenetic group. FFUP_PS_41 harbors a 498,516-bp untypable megaplasmid (pJBCL41) with low similarity compared with publicly available plasmids. pJBCL41 contains a full set of genes for self-transmission and genes predicted to be responsible for plasmid replication, partitioning, maintenance and heavy metal resistance. pJBCL41 carries a class 1 integron with the |aacA7|blaVIM-2|aacA4| cassette array (In103) located within a defective Tn402-like transposon that forms part of a 50,273-bp mosaic region bound by 38-bp inverted repeats typical of the Tn3 family and flanked by 5-bp direct repeats. This region is composed of different elements, including additional transposon fragments, five insertion sequences and a Tn3-Derived Inverted-Repeat Miniature Element.

    "abstract": "Development of extreme resistance to multiple antibiotics is the major concern in infections due to biofilm forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The existing antibiotics have become ineffective against biofilm associated infections and hence, in this study, the combinatorial efficacy of antibiotics with a quorum sensing inhibitor (quercetin) was tested against biofilm forming P. aeruginosa isolates. The effect of drug combinations was studied by the checkerboard method. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated for determining the synergistic effect. Additionally, biofilm cell viability, time-kill and live-dead assays were performed to study the combinatorial effect. MIC of quercetin against all the P. aeruginosa strains was 500 g/mL. However, quercetin at 125 g/mL showed synergistic effect with [1/2] x MIC or [1/4] x MIC of all the antibiotics against all the strains. Quercetin (125 g/mL) with [1/2] MIC of levofloxacin and tobramycin combinations were highly effective with [&ge;]80% killing of biofilm associated cells. Increasing the concentration to 250 g/mL with [1/2] x MIC antibiotics could completely inhibit the biofilm cell viability in quercetin combination with amikacin and tobramycin. The findings show that quercetin combinations can enhance the treatment outcome against P. aeruginosa infection and this approach may reduce antibiotic overuse and selection pressure.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/601336_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (27K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cca26dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bbcc0forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5216b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@150c53d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "RNA-sequencing analyses are often limited to identifying lowest p-value transcripts, which does not address polygenic phenomena. To overcome this limitation, we developed an integrative approach that combines large scale transcriptomic meta-analysis of patient brain tissues with single-cell sequencing data of CNS neurons, short RNA-sequencing of human male- and female-originated cell lines, and connectomics of transcription factor- and microRNA-interactions with perturbed transcripts. We used this pipeline to analyze cortical transcripts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. While these pathologies show massive transcriptional parallels, their clinically well-known sexual dimorphisms remain unexplained. Our method explicates the differences between afflicted men and women, and identifies disease-affected pathways of cholinergic transmission and gp130-family neurokine controllers of immune function, interlinked by microRNAs. This approach may open new perspectives for seeking biomarkers and therapeutic targets, also in other transmitter systems and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genes often generate a variety of RNA isoforms that can lead to functionally distinct protein variants. The synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms is however poorly characterized. The reason for this is that current methods to quantify RNA metabolism use  short-read sequencing that cannot detect RNA isoforms. Here we present nanopore sequencing-based Isoform Dynamics (nano-ID), a method that detects newly synthesized RNA isoforms and monitors isoform metabolism. nano-ID combines metabolic RNA labeling,  long-read nanopore sequencing of native RNA molecules and machine learning. Application of nano-ID to the heat shock response in human cells reveals that many RNA isoforms change their synthesis rate, stability, and splicing pattern. nano-ID also shows that the metabolism of individual RNA isoforms differs strongly from that estimated for the combined RNA signal at a specific gene locus. And although combined RNA stability correlates with poly(A)-tail length, individual RNA isoforms can deviate significantly. nano-ID enables studies of RNA metabolism on the level of single RNA molecules and isoforms in different cell states and conditions.",

    "abstract": "We approach the C. elegans connectome as an information processing network that receives input from about 90 sensory neurons, processes that information through a highly recurrent network of about 80 interneurons, and it produces a coordinated output from about 120 motor neurons that control the nematodes muscles. We focus on the feedforward flow of information from sensory neurons to motor neurons, and apply a recently developed network analysis framework referred to as the \"hourglass effect\". The analysis reveals that this feedforward flow traverses a small core (\"hourglass waist\") that consists of 10-15 interneurons. These are mostly the same interneurons that were previously shown (using a different analytical approach) to constitute the \"rich-club\" of the C. elegans connectome. This result is robust to the methodology that separates the feedforward from the feedback flow of information. The set of core interneurons remains mostly the same when we consider only chemical synapses or the combination of chemical synapses and gap junctions. The hourglass organization of the connectome suggests that C. elegans has some similarities with encoder-decoder artificial neural networks in which the input is first compressed and integrated in a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the given data in a more efficient manner, followed by a decoding network through which intermediate-level sub-functions are combined in different ways to compute the correlated outputs of the network. The core neurons at the hourglass waist represent the information bottleneck of the system, balancing the representation accuracy and compactness (complexity) of the given sensory information.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe C. elegans nematode is the only species for which the complete wiring diagram (\"connectome\") of its neural system has been mapped. The connectome provides architectural constraints that limit the scope of possible functions of a neural system. In this work, we identify one such architectural constraint: the C. elegans connectome includes a small set (10-15) of neurons that compress and integrate the information provided by the much larger set of sensory neurons. These intermediate-level neurons encode few sub-functions that are combined and re-used in different ways to activate the circuits of motor neurons, which drive all higher-level complex functions of the organism such as feeding or locomotion. We refer to this encoding-decoding structure as \"hourglass architecture\" and identify the core neurons at the \"waist\" of the hourglass. We also discuss the similarities between this property of the C. elegans connectome and artificial neural networks. The hourglass architecture opens a new way to think about, and experiment with, intermediate-level neurons between input and output neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity associated with successful cognition appears as a tilt in the power spectrum of the local field potential, wherein increases in high-frequency power accompany decreases in low frequency power. Whereas this pattern has been shown in a wide range of memory tasks, it is unknown whether this increased spectral tilt reflects underlying memory-specific processes or rather a domain-general index of task engagement. To address the question of whether increased spectral tilt reflects increased attention to a cognitive task, we collected intracranial recordings from three hundred thirty neurosurgical patients as they performed a mathematical problem solving task. We used a mathematical problem solving task, because it allowed us to decouple task-specific processes with domain-general attention in a novel way. Using a statistical model to control for inherent problem complexity, we classified individual math problems based on whether a subject performed faster than predicted (high-attention or fast) or slower than predicted (low-attention, or slow) based on residual response times. In contrast to the domain-general attentional account, problems that took longer than predicted produced stronger evidence for the spectral tilt: widespread increases in high frequency (31-180 Hz) power and decreases in low frequency (3-17 Hz) power across frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. The pattern emerged early within each trial and was sustained throughout the response period but was not observed in the medial temporal lobe. The data show that engaging in mathematical problem solving leads to a distributed spectral tilt pattern, even when accounting for variability in performance driven by the arithmetic demands of the problems themselves, and suggest that broadband changes in the power spectrum reflect an index of information processing in the brain beyond simple attention to the cognitive task.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine is hypothesized to convey important error information in reinforcement learning tasks with explicit appetitive or aversive cues. However, during motor skill learning the only available feedback signal is typically an animals evaluation of the sensory feedback arising from its own behavior, rather than any external reward or punishment. It has previously been shown that intact dopaminergic signaling from the ventral tegmental area - substantia nigra compacta complex (VTA/SNc) is necessary for vocal learning in response to an external aversive auditory cue in songbirds. However, the role of dopamine in learning in the absence of explicit external cues is still unclear. Here we used male Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata var. domestica) to test the hypothesis that dopamine signaling is necessary for self-evaluation driven sensorimotor learning. We combined 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of dopaminergic terminals within Area X, a songbird basal ganglia nucleus critical for vocal learning, with a headphones learning paradigm that shifted the birds auditory feedback and compared their learning to birds without lesions. We found that 6-OHDA lesions affected song behavior in two ways. First, over a period of days lesioned birds systemically lowered their pitch regardless of the presence or absence of auditory errors. Second, 6-OHDA lesioned birds also displayed severe deficits in sensorimotor learning as measured by their adaptive change in pitch in response to the pitch-shifted auditory error. Our results suggest roles for dopamine both in motor production and in auditory error processing during vocal learning.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDopamine has been hypothesized to convey a reward prediction error signal in learning tasks involving external reinforcement. However the role dopamine plays in tasks involving self-guided error correction in the absence of external reinforcement is much less clear. To address this question, we studied the role of dopamine in sensorimotor adaptation using male Bengalese finches, which spontaneously produce a complex motor behavior (song) and are capable of modulating their behavioral output in response to induced auditory errors. Our results reveal that in addition to conveying errors in motor performance, dopamine may also have a role in modulating effort and in choosing a corrective response to the auditory error.",

    "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) is an important phytohormone mediating both local and systemic defense responses in plants. Despite over half a century of research, how plants biosynthesize SA remains unresolved. In Arabidopsis, a major part of SA is derived from isochorismate, a key intermediate produced by the isochorismate synthase (ICS), which is reminiscent of SA biosynthesis in bacteria. Whereas bacteria employ an isochorismate pyruvate lyase (IPL) that catalyzes the turnover of isochorismate to pyruvate and SA, plants do not contain an IPL ortholog and generate SA from isochorismate through an unknown mechanism. Combining genetic and biochemical approaches, we delineated the SA biosynthetic pathway downstream of isochorismate in Arabidopsis. We show that PBS3, a GH3 acyl adenylase-family enzyme important for SA accumulation, catalyzes ATP- and Mg2+-dependent conjugation of L-glutamate primarily to the 8-carboxyl of isochorismate and yields the key SA biosynthetic intermediate isochorismoyl-glutamate A. Moreover, EPS1, a BAHD acyltransferase-family protein with previously implicated role in SA accumulation upon pathogen attack, harbors a noncanonical active site and an unprecedented isochorismoyl-glutamate A pyruvoyl-glutamate lyase (IPGL) activity that produces SA from the isochorismoyl-glutamate A substrate. Together, PBS3 and EPS1 form a two-step metabolic pathway to produce SA from isochorismate in Arabidopsis, which is distinct from how SA is biosynthesized in bacteria. This study closes a major knowledge gap in plant SA metabolism and would help develop new strategies for engineering disease resistance in crop plants.",

Optogenetic systems have recently been employed for controlling gene expression levels in mammalian cells, but most have utilized activator-based proteins, neglecting negative feedback.

We build a toolset of these noise-reducing Light-Inducible Tuner (LITer) gene circuits using the TetR repressor fused with a Tet-Inhibitory peptide (TIP) or a degradation tag through the light-sensitive LOV2 protein domain. These LITers provide nearly a range of 4-fold gene expression control and up to five-fold noise reduction from existing optogenetic systems. Moreover, we use the LITer gene circuit architecture to control gene expression of the cancer oncogene KRAS(G12V) and study its downstream effects through phospho-ERK levels and cellular proliferation. Overall, these novel LITer optogenetic platforms should enable precise spatiotemporal perturbations for studying multicellular phenotypes in developmental biology, oncology, and other biomedical fields of research.",

    "abstract": "Human {gamma}D-crystallin (H{gamma}D) is an abundant and highly stable two-domain protein in the core region of the eye lens. Destabilizing mutations and post-translational modifications in this protein are linked to onset of aggregation that causes cataract disease (lens turbidity). Wild-type H{gamma}D greatly accelerates aggregation of the cataract-related W42Q variant, without itself aggregating. The mechanism of this \\\"inverse prion\\\" catalysis of aggregation remained unknown. Here we provide evidence that an early unfolding intermediate with an opened domain interface enables transient dimerization of the C-terminal domains of wild-type and mutant, or mutant and mutant, H{gamma}D molecules, which deprives the mutants N-terminal domain of intramolecular stabilization by the native domain interface and thus accelerates its misfolding to a distinct, aggregation-prone intermediate. A detailed kinetic model predicts universal power-law scaling relationships for lag time and rate of the resulting aggregation, which are in excellent agreement with the data. The mechanism reported here, which we term interface stealing, can be generalized to explain how common domain-domain interactions can have surprising consequences, such as conformational catalysis of unfolding, in multidomain proteins.\\n\\nSignificanceMost known proteins in nature consist of multiple domains. Interactions between domains may lead to unexpected folding and misfolding phenomena. This study of human {gamma}D-crystallin, a two-domain protein in the eye lens, revealed one such surprise: conformational catalysis of misfolding via intermolecular domain interface \\\"stealing.\\\" An intermolecular interface between the more stable domains outcompetes the native intramolecular domain interface. Loss of the native interface in turn promotes misfolding and subsequent aggregation, especially in cataract-related {gamma}D-crystallin variants. This phenomenon is likely a contributing factor in the development of cataract disease, the leading worldwide cause of blindness. However, interface stealing likely occurs in many proteins composed of two or more interacting domains.",

    "abstract": "The immediate capacity for adaptation under current environmental conditions is directly proportional to the additive genetic variance for fitness, VA(W). Mean absolute fitness, [Formula], is predicted to change at the rate [Formula], according to Fishers Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection. Despite ample research evaluating degree of local adaptation, direct assessment of VA(W) and the capacity for ongoing adaptation is exceedingly rare. We estimated VA(W) and [Formula] in three pedigreed populations of annual Chamaecrista fasciculata, over three years in the wild. Contrasting with common expectations, we found significant VA(W) in all populations and years, predicting increased mean fitness in subsequent generations (0.83 to 6.12 seeds per individual). Further, we detected two cases predicting \\\"evolutionary rescue\\\", where selection on standing VA(W) was expected to increase fitness of declining populations ([Formula] < 1.0) to levels consistent with population sustainability and growth. Within populations, interannual differences in genetic expression of fitness were striking. Significant genotype-by-year interactions reflected modest correlations between breeding values across years (all r < 0.490), indicating temporally variable selection at the genotypic level; that could contribute to maintaining VA(W). By directly estimating VA(W) and total lifetime [Formula], our study presents an experimental approach for studies of adaptive capacity in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Head motion estimates in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans appear qualitatively different with sub-second image sampling rates compared to the multi-second sampling rates common in the past. Whereas formerly the head appeared still for much of a scan with brief excursions from baseline, the head now appears to be in constant motion, and motion estimates often seem to divulge little information about what is happening in a scan. This constant motion has been attributed to respiratory oscillations that do not alias at faster sampling rates, and investigators are divided on the extent to which such motion is \\\"real\\\" motion or only \\\"apparent\\\" pseudomotion. Some investigators have abandoned the use of motion estimates entirely due to these considerations. Here we investigate the properties of motion in several fMRI datasets sampled at rates between 720-1160 ms, and describe 5 distinct kinds of respiratory motion: 1) constant real respiratory motion in the form of head nodding most evident in vertical position and pitch, which can be very large; 2) constant pseudomotion at the same respiratory rate as real motion, occurring only in the phase encode direction; 3) punctate real motions occurring at times of very deep breaths; 4) a low-frequency pseudomotion in only the phase encode direction following very deep breaths; 5) slow modulation of vertical and anterior-posterior head position by the respiratory envelope. We reformulate motion estimates in light of these considerations and obtain good concordance between motion estimates, physiologic records, image quality measures, and events evident in the fMRI signals.\\n\\nHighlights- Examines several fast-TR datasets with sampling rates of 720-1160 ms\\n- Identifies 7 kinds of motion in fMRI scans, 5 of them related to respiration\\n- Identifies 2 forms of pseudomotion occurring only in phase encode direction\\n- Pseudomotion is a function of soft tissue mass, not lung volume\\n- Reformulates motion estimates to draw out particular kinds of motion",

    "abstract": "Mammalian neocortex exhibits a disproportionally \\\"luxurious\\\" representation of somatotopies in its lateral region, which depends on dorsal-to-ventral expansion of the pallium during development. Despite recent studies elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the cortical arealization/patterning, we know very little about how the cortex expands ventrally and the nature of the underlying force-generating events. We found that neurons born earliest (at embryonic day 10 [E10]) in the mouse pallium migrated ventrally and then extended corticofugal axons, which together formed a morphogenetic flow of the preplate that persists until E13. These neurons exerted pulling and pushing forces at the process and the soma, respectively. Ablation of these E10-born neurons attenuated both deflection of radial glial fibers (by E13) and extension of the cortical plate (by E14), which should occur ventrally, and subsequently shrank the postnatal neocortical map dorsally. This previously unrecognized preplate stream physically primes neocortical expansion and somatotopic map formation.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity--one individuals capacity for phenotypic variation under different environments--is critical for organisms facing fluctuating conditions within their lifetime. North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) experience drastic among-year fluctuations in conspecific density. This shapes juvenile competition over vacant territories and overwinter survival. To help young cope with competition at high densities, mothers can increase offspring growth rates via a glucocorticoid-mediated maternal effect. However, this effect is only adaptive under high densities, and faster growth often comes at a cost to longevity. While experiments have demonstrated that red squirrels can adjust hormones in response to fluctuating density, the degree to which mothers differ in their ability to regulate glucocorticoids across changing densities remains unknown--little is known about within-individual plasticity in endocrine traits relative to among-individual variation. Findings from our reaction norm approach revealed significant individual variation not only in a female red squirrels mean endocrine phenotype, but also in endocrine plasticity in response to changes in local density. Future work on the proximate and ultimate drivers of variation in the plasticity of endocrine traits and maternal effects is needed, particularly in free-living animals experiencing fluctuating environments.",

    "abstract": "Although homologous recombination is accepted to be common in bacteria, so far it has been challenging to accurately quantify its impact on genome evolution within bacterial species. We here introduce methods that use the statistics of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) splits in the core genome alignment of a set of strains to show that, for many bacterial species, recombination dominates genome evolution. Each genomic locus has been overwritten so many times by recombination that it is impossible to reconstruct the clonal phylogeny and, instead of a consensus phylogeny, the phylogeny typically changes many thousands of times along the core genome alignment.\n\nWe also show how SNP splits can be used to quantify the relative rates with which different subsets of strains have recombined in the past. We find that virtually every strain has a unique pattern of frequencies with which its lineages have recombined with those of other strains, and that the relative rates with which different subsets of strains share SNPs follow long-tailed distributions. Our findings show that bacterial populations are neither clonal nor freely recombining, but structured such that recombination rates between different lineages vary along a continuum spanning several orders of magnitude, with a unique pattern of rates for each lineage. Thus, rather than reflecting clonal ancestry, whole genome phylogenies reflect these long-tailed distributions of recombination rates.",

    "abstract": "1How microbes allocate carbon to growth vs. respiration plays a central role in determining the ability of soil to retain carbon. This carbon use efficiency (CUE) is increasingly measured using the 18O-H2O method, in which heavy oxygen incorporated into DNA is used to estimate growth. Here we evaluated the validity of some of the assumptions of this method using a literature search, and then tested how violating them affected estimates of the growth component of carbon use efficiency in soil. We found that the 18O method is consistently sensitive to assumptions made about oxygen sources to DNA, but that the effect of other assumptions depends on the microbial community present. We provide an example for how the tools developed here may be used with observed CUE values, and demonstrate that the original conclusions drawn from the data remain robust in the face of methodological bias. Our results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the consequences to the 18O method underlying assumptions. Future studies can use the approach developed here to identify how different incubation conditions and/or treatments might bias its CUE estimates and how trustworthy their results are. Further wet-lab work dissecting the assumptions of the 18O method in soil will help justify the scenarios under which it is reasonable to trust its results.",

The simple 5.2 kilobase pair dsDNA genome expresses just seven known proteins, thus it relies heavily on host machinery to replicate. How the host proteome changes over the course of infection is key to understanding this host:virus interplay. Here for the first time quantitative temporal viromics has been used to quantify global changes in >9,000 host proteins in two types of primary human epithelial cell throughout 72 hours of BKPyV infection. These data demonstrate the importance both of cell cycle progression and pseudo-G2 arrest in effective BKPyV replication, along with a surprising lack of innate immune response throughout the whole virus replication cycle. BKPyV thus evades pathogen recognition to prevent activation of innate immune responses in a sophisticated manner.",

Despite the prevalence of co-use, factors that influence the suppression and enhancement of concurrent alcohol and nicotine intake are largely unknown.\\n\\nObjectivesOur goals were to assess how nicotine abstinence and availability influenced concurrent alcohol consumption, and to determine the impact of quinine adulteration of alcohol on aversion resistant alcohol consumption and concurrent nicotine consumption.\\n\\nMethodsMale and female C57BL/6J mice voluntarily consumed unsweetened alcohol, nicotine and water in a chronic 3-bottle choice procedure. In Experiment 1, nicotine access was removed for 1 week and re-introduced the following week, while the alcohol and water bottles remained available at all times. In Experiment 2, quinine (100-1000 M) was added to the 20% alcohol bottle, while the nicotine and water bottles remained unaltered.\\n\\nResultsIn Experiment 1, we found that alcohol consumption and preference were unaffected by the presence or absence of nicotine access in both male and female mice. In Experiment 2a, we found that quinine temporarily suppressed alcohol intake and enhanced concurrent nicotine, but not water, preference in both male and female mice. In Experiment 2b, chronic quinine suppression of alcohol intake increased nicotine consumption and preference in female mice without affecting water preference, whereas it increased water and nicotine preference in male mice.\\n\\nConclusionsQuinine suppression of alcohol consumption enhanced the preference for concurrent nicotine preference in male and female mice, suggesting that mice compensate for the quinine adulteration of alcohol by increasing their nicotine preference.",

    "abstract": "The rice field eel Monopterus albus is a hermaphroditic protogynous fish species that undergoes sex reversal from female to male. However, the potential mechanisms underlying the process of sex transformation are still unclear. We analyzed and compared the gene sequence of M. albus dmrt1 5' upstream region and its potential transcription factor binding sites with other known species and examined the in vitro effects of testosterone (T) on the expression levels of dmrt1a and foxl2 in the ovotestis. Moreover, we cloned and analyzed the expression of genes encoding enzymes, 11{beta}-hydroxylase (11{beta}-h) and 11{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11{beta}-hsd), involved in the production of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT). The results showed that, compared with other fish species, M. albus dmrt1 5' upstream region contained unique androgen response elements (AREs) with one on the sense strand and the other one on the antisense strand, indicating a crucial role for androgens in the transcriptional regulation of dmrt1. The expression of dmrt1a was induced but the expression of foxl2 was inhibited by T manipulation in vitro, suggesting that blood androgen could activate the transcription of dmrt1 in the ovotestis. Moreover, the expression levels of 11{beta}-h and 11{beta}-hsd2 were predominantly expressed in testis, much less in ovotestis, and barely in ovary, suggesting the production of 11-KT during sex reversal. Androgens are synthesized in large amounts during sex reversal, leading to the promotion of dmrt1 transcription, and thus, gonadal somatic cells transdifferetiation. Overall, androgen-dmrt1 positive feedback programs the M. albus sex reversal.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the brain is a fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. Over the past decade there has been a growing effort to introduce neuroscience in primary and secondary schools, however hands-on laboratories have been limited to anatomical or electrophysiological activities. Modern neuroscience research labs are increasingly using computational tools to model circuits of the brain to understand information processing. Here we introduce the use of neurorobots - robots controlled by computer models of biological brains - as an introduction to computational neuroscience in the K-12 classroom. Neurorobotics has enormous potential as an education technology because it combines multiple activities with clear educational benefits including neuroscience, active learning, and robotics. We describe an introductory neurorobot workshop that teaches high school students how to use neurorobots to investigate key concepts in neuroscience, including spiking neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and adaptive action selection. Our do-it-yourself (DIY) neurorobot uses wheels, a camera, a speaker, and a distance sensor to interact with its environment, and can be built from generic parts costing about $150 in under 4 hrs. Our Neurorobot App visualizes the neurorobot's visual input and brain activity in real-time, and enables students to design new brains and deliver dopamine-like reward signals to reinforce chosen behaviors. We have tested the Neurorobot Workshop with high school students (n = 3 workshops, 9 students total) and have found that students were able to complete all exercises in under 3 hrs. In a post-workshop survey, students reported having gained the ability to develop neural networks that perform specific functions, including goal-directed behavior and memory. Here we provide DIY hardware assembly instructions, discuss our open-source Neurorobot App and demonstrate how to teach the Neurorobot Workshop. By doing this we hope to accelerate research in educational neurorobotics and promote the use of neurorobots to teach computational neuroscience in high school.",
