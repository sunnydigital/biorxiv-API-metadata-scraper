    "abstract": "The clock of life ticks as fast as how efficiently proteins could perform their functional dynamics. Protein complexes execute functions via several large-scale intrinsic motions across multiple conformational states, which occur at a timescale of nano-to milliseconds for well-folded proteins. Computationally expensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been the only theoretical tool to time and size these motions, though barely to their slowest ends. Here, we convert a simple elastic network model (ENM), which takes a few seconds (ubiquitin) to hours (ribosome) for the analysis, into a molecular timer and sizer to gauge the slowest functional motions of proteins. Quasi-harmonic analysis, fluctuation-profile matching (FPM) and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem (WKT) are used to define the \\\"time-periods\\\", t, for anharmonic principal components (PCs) which are validated by NMR order parameters. The PCs with their respective \\\"time-periods\\\" are mapped to the eigenvalues ({lambda}ENM) of the corresponding ENM modes. Thus, the power laws t(ns) = 86.9{lambda}ENM-1.9 and {sigma}2([A]2) = 46.1 {lambda}ENM-2.5 are established allowing the characterization of the time scales of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-solved conformers, crystallographic anisotropic displacement parameters, and important ribosomal motions, as well as motional sizes of the latter.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe time scale of biological processes is governed by protein functional dynamics that often corresponds to the largest conformational spread and the longest time scales among all possible motions. Current simulation methodologies cannot reach the slowest, often functional, motions especially for supramolecular machineries. Borrowing the spring-bead model used in polymer physics since 60s, the efficient elastic network model (ENM), introduced in 90s, captured all modes of protein motions but largely underestimated the time scales of slowest modes due to its harmonic approximation.\\n\\nHere we map water-damped modes sampled by MD simulations to corresponding ones in ENM and thereby establish 2 power laws that describe the authentic time scales and sizes for the slowest anharmonic modes as functions of ENM eigenvalues. With that, we adequately describe the sizes and time scales for three proteins, confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and ribosome that contains ~0.2 million heavy atoms (~ 20 thousands coarse-grained nodes).",

    "abstract": "The proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to the additive effects of a given set of genotyped SNPs (i.e. SNP-heritability) is a fundamental quantity in the study of complex traits. Recent works have shown that existing methods to estimate genome-wide SNP-heritability often yield biases when their assumptions are violated. While various approaches have been proposed to account for frequency- and LD-dependent genetic architectures, it remains unclear which estimates of SNP-heritability reported in the literature are reliable. Here we show that genome-wide SNP-heritability can be accurately estimated from biobank-scale data irrespective of the underlying genetic architecture of the trait, without specifying a heritability model or partitioning SNPs by minor allele frequency and/or LD. We use theoretical justifications coupled with extensive simulations starting from real genotypes from the UK Biobank (N=337K) to show that, unlike existing methods, our closed-form estimator for SNP-heritability is highly accurate across a wide range of architectures. We provide estimates of SNP-heritability for 22 complex traits and diseases in the UK Biobank and show that, consistent with our results in simulations, existing biobank-scale methods yield estimates up to 30% different from our theoretically-justified approach.",

However, strategies for determining RNA structure in vivo are limited, with established chemical probing and newer duplex detection methods each having notable deficiencies. Here we convert the common reagent dimethyl sulfate (DMS) into a useful probe of all four RNA nucleotides. Building on this advance, we introduce PAIR-MaP, which uses single-molecule correlated chemical probing to directly detect base pairing interactions in cells. PAIR-MaP has superior resolution and accuracy compared to alternative experiments, can resolve alternative pairing interactions of structurally dynamic RNAs, and enables highly accurate structure modeling, including of RNAs containing multiple pseudoknots and extensively bound by proteins. Application of PAIR-MaP to human RNase MRP and two bacterial mRNA 5'-UTRs reveals new functionally important and complex structures undetectable by conventional analyses. PAIR-MaP is a powerful, experimentally concise, and broadly applicable strategy for directly visualizing RNA base pairs and dynamics in cells.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin accessibility, as a powerful marker of active DNA regulatory elements, provides valuable information for understanding regulatory mechanisms. The revolution in high-throughput methods has accumulated massive chromatin accessibility profiles in public repositories. Nevertheless, utilization of these data is hampered by cumbersome collection, time-consuming processing, and manual chromatin accessibility (openness) annotation of genomic regions. To fill this gap, we developed OpenAnnotate (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/openannotate/) as the first web server for efficiently annotating openness of massive genomic regions across various biosample types, tissues, and biological systems. In addition to the annotation resource from 2729 comprehensive profiles of 614 biosample types of human and mouse, OpenAnnotate provides user-friendly functionalities, ultra-efficient calculation, real-time browsing, intuitive visualization, and elaborate application notebooks. We show its unique advantages compared to existing databases and toolkits by effectively revealing cell type-specificity, identifying regulatory elements and 3D chromatin contacts, deciphering gene functional relationships, inferring functions of transcription factors, and unprecedentedly promoting single-cell data analyses. We anticipate OpenAnnotate will provide a promising avenue for researchers to construct a more holistic perspective to understand regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Classifying patients into clinically and biologically homogenous subgroups will facilitate the understanding of disease pathophysiology and development of more targeted prevention and intervention strategies. Traditionally, disease subtyping is based on clinical characteristics alone, however disease subtypes identified by such an approach may not conform exactly to the underlying biological mechanisms. Very few studies have integrated genomic profiles (such as those from GWAS) with clinical symptoms for disease subtyping.\\n\\nIn this study, we proposed a novel analytic framework capable of finding subgroups of complex diseases by leveraging both GWAS-predicted gene expression levels and clinical data by a multi-view bicluster analysis. This approach connects SNPs to genes via their effects on expression, hence the analysis is more biologically relevant and interpretable than a pure SNP-based analysis. Transcriptome of different tissues can also be readily modelled. We also proposed various new evaluation or validation metrics, such as a newly modified  prediction strength measure to assess generalization of clustering performance. The proposed framework was applied to derive subtypes for schizophrenia, and to stratify subjects into different levels of cardiometabolic risks.\\n\\nOur framework was able to subtype schizophrenia patients with diverse prognosis and treatment response. We also applied the framework to the Northern Finland Cohort (NFBC) 1966 dataset, and identified high- and low cardiometabolic risk subgroups in a gender-stratified analysis. Our results suggest a more data-driven and biologically-informed approach to defining metabolic syndrome. The prediction strength was over 80%, suggesting that the cluster model generalizes well to new datasets. Moreover, we found that the genes  blindly selected by the cluster algorithm are significantly enriched for known susceptibility genes discovered in GWAS of schizophrenia and cardiovascular diseases, providing further support to the validity of our approach. The proposed framework may be applied to any complex diseases, and opens up a new approach to patient stratification.",

    "abstract": "The healthcare industry is in dire need for rapid microbial identification techniques. Microbial infection is a major healthcare issue with significant prevalence and mortality, which can be treated effectively during the early stages using appropriate antibiotics. However, determining the appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of the early stages of infection remains a challenge, mainly due to the lack of rapid microbial identification techniques. Conventional culture-based identification and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy are the gold standard methods, but the sample amplification process is extremely time-consuming. Here, we propose an identification framework that can be used to measure minute quantities of microbes by incorporating artificial neural networks with three-dimensional quantitative phase imaging. We aimed to accurately identify the species of bacterial bloodstream infection pathogens based on a single colony-forming unit of the bacteria. The successful distinction between a total of 19 species, with the accuracy of 99.9% when ten bacteria were measured, suggests that our framework can serve as an effective advisory tool for clinicians during the initial antibiotic prescription.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/596486v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@786668org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8b4eb4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc2452org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4888c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The loss of body ownership, the feeling that your body and its limbs no longer belong to you, presents a severe clinical condition that has proven difficult to study directly. We here propose a novel paradigm using mixed reality to interfere with natural embodiment using temporally conflicting sensory signals from the own hand. In Experiment 1 we investigated how such a mismatch affects phenomenological and physiological aspects of embodiment, and identified its most important dimensions using a principle component analysis. The results suggest that such a mismatch induces a strong reduction in embodiment accompanied by an increase in feelings of disownership and deafference, which was, however, not reflected in physiological changes. In Experiment 2 we refined the paradigm to measure perceptual thresholds for temporal mismatches and compared how different multimodal, mismatching information alters the sense of embodiment. The results showed that while visual delay decreased embodiment both while actively moving and during passive touch, the effect was stronger for the former. Our results extend previous findings as they demonstrate that a sense of disembodiment can be induced through controlled multimodal mismatches about ones own body and more so during active movement as compared to passive touch. Based on the ecologically more valid protocol we propose here, we argue that such a sense of disembodiment may fundamentally differ from disownership sensations as discussed in the rubber hand illusion literature, and emphasize its clinical relevance. This might importantly advance the current debate on the relative contribution of different modalities to our sense of body and its plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the glutamate and monoamine systems contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicide. We have tested the expression of genes encoding glutamate transporters and monoaminergic proteins in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of MDD subjects who died by suicide (MDD-S, n=51), MDD non-suicide subjects (MDD-NS, n=28), and non-psychiatric controls (CTRL, n=32). We analyzed glutamate transporters (EAAT1, EAAT2, VGLUT1, and VGLUT2) and monoaminergic genes (SERT, NET, DAT, PMAT, VMAT, TPH1 and TPH2). Females but not males with MDD showed higher expression of all glutamate transporters relative to CTRLs (P<0.05). MDD-S groups of both sexes had higher VGLUT2 expression (P<0.05). MDD-S females who were antidepressant positive (+) had lower EAAT1 expression (P=0.004), perhaps indicating poor treatment response. Analyses of monoaminergic genes revealed lower VMAT1 expression (P=0.002) in MDD males, and conversely higher VMAT2 in MDD females (P=0.004). MDD females also had higher VMAT2, TPH2 and NET expression (p<0.05), and in contrast, MDD males had lower VMAT1 and PMAT expression. Therefore, we report sex differences in the expression of glutamate transporters and some monoaminergic genes in the DLPFC in MDD. Most of these findings are novel, but lower EAAT1 expression in MDD-S replicates previous studies. Lower EAAT1 expression coupled with higher VGLUT2 expression in MDD-S may lead to increased synaptic glutamate, neuronal loss and glial loss in the DLPFC in MDD and suicide reported previously. These deficits may contribute to lower DLPFC activity, poor problem solving and impaired executive function exhibited in severe depression and suicide.",

The results led to the identification and characterization of a distinct and dominant Accumulibacter oligotype - Oligotype 2 (belonging to Clade IIC) and its matching MAG (RC14) associated with side-stream EBPR configuration. We are also able to extract MAGs belonging to CAP clades IIB (RCAB4-2) and II (RC18) which did not have representative genomes before. This study demonstrates and validates the use of a high-throughput approach of oligotyping analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences to elucidate CAP clade-level diversity.

While most previous work has assumed that this bias is a fixed trait, we argue that it can vary within an individual. In particular, we propose that the brain arbitrates between Pavlovian and instrumental control by inferring which is a better predictor of reward. The instrumental predictor is more flexible; it can learn values that depend on both stimuli and actions, whereas the Pavlovian predictor learns values that depend only on stimuli. The arbitration theory predicts that the Pavlovian predictor will be favored when rewards are relatively uncontrollable, because the additional flexibility of the instrumental predictor is not useful. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the Pavlovian approach bias is stronger under low control compared to high control contexts.",

We present libsbmljs, a JavaScript / WebAssembly library for Node.js and the Web with full support for all SBML extensions. Our library is an enabling technology for online SBML editors, model-building tools, and web-based simulators, and runs entirely in the browser without the need for any dedicated server resources. We provide NPM packages, an extensive set of examples, JavaScript API documentation, and an online demo that allows users to read and validate the SBML content of any model in the BioModels and BiGG databases. We also provide instructions and scripts to allow users to build a copy of libsbmljs against any libSBML version. Although our library supports all existing SBML extensions, we cover how to add additional extensions to the wrapper, should any arise in the future. To demonstrate the utility of this implementation, we also provide a demo at https://libsbmljsdemo.github.io/ with a proof-of-concept SBML simulator that supports ODE and stochastic simulations for SBML core models. Our project is hosted at https://libsbmljs.github.io/, which contains links to examples, API documentation, and all source code files and build scripts used to create libsbmljs.

    "abstract": "Attending the veterinary clinic is an integral part of the physical welfare of every companion dog. However, some dogs experience their veterinary visits negatively, which poses a risk of injury to the veterinary staff, their guardian (owner) and themselves during veterinary examinations. It may also influence the regularity of non-urgent veterinary appointments. To date there has been conflicting data on the proportion of dogs that are fearful during their veterinary visits. In this study, we explored the risk factors associated with fear during veterinary examination and in novel situations (including first time at the veterinary clinic) from 26,555 responses in the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire database. According to their guardians, over half (55%) of companion dogs displayed some form of fearful behaviour (mild-extreme) when examined by a veterinarian, while 14% of dogs exhibited severe or extreme fear. A similar trend was observed with dogs responding fearfully in unfamiliar situations, including the dogs first time at the veterinary clinic. Chi-squared tests showed every bivariate relationship was significant (p < 0.05). The most important predictors of fear in a veterinary examination were, in order: the dogs breed group (27.1%), their history of roles or activities (16.7%), where they were sourced (15.2%), their weight (12%), the age of other dogs in the household (9.5%) and dog owner experience (6.3%). However, these risk factors accumulate to explain a total of 7% of variance of fear observed during veterinary examination. Results demonstrate that fear of veterinary visits is common in dogs, but that other factors (including the environment or human-animal interactions) are likely to contribute more to prevalence and severity of this problem than the demographic factors measured here. Finally, we highlight opportunities for future research aimed at facilitating less stressful veterinary visits for dogs and their guardians.",

    "abstract": "In order to survive and function in the world, we must understand the content of our environment. This requires us to gather and parse complex, sometimes conflicting, information. Yet, the brain is capable of translating sensory stimuli from disparate modalities into a cohesive and accurate percept with little conscious effort. Previous studies of multisensory integration have suggested that the brains integration of cues is well-approximated by an ideal observer implementing Bayesian causal inference. However, behavioral data from tasks that include only one stimulus in each modality fail to capture what is in nature a complex process. Here we employed an auditory spatial discrimination task in which listeners were asked to determine on which side they heard one of two concurrently presented sounds. We compared two visual conditions in which task-uninformative shapes were presented in the center of the screen, or spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli. We found that performance on the auditory task improved when the visual stimuli were spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli--even though the shapes provided no information about which side the auditory target was on. We also demonstrate that a model of a Bayesian ideal observer performing causal inference cannot explain this improvement, demonstrating that humans deviate systematically from the ideal observer model.",

More importantly, these cells exhibited embryonic differentiation potentials that could be induced into osteoblastic and endothelial cells in vitro. The current study examined human nerve specimens to compare and characterize the cells after BMP-2 stimulation. Fresh pieces of human nerve tissue were minced and treated with either BMP-2 (750ng/ml) or vehicle for 12 hours at 37{degrees}C, before digested in 0.2% collagenase and 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Isolated cells were cultured in restrictive stem cell medium. Significantly more cells were obtained from the nerve pieces with BMP-2 treatment in comparison with the non-treated controls. Cell colonies were starting to form at day 3. Expressions of the 4 transcription factors Klf4, c-Myc, Sox2 and Oct4 were confirmed at both transcriptional and translational levels. The cells can be maintained in the stem cell culture medium for at least 6 weeks without changing morphologies. When the cells were switched to fibroblast growth medium, dispersed spindle-shaped cells were noted and became fibroblast activated protein- (FAP) positive following immunocytochemistry staining. The data suggested that human peripheral nerve tissue also contain a population of cells that can respond to BMP-2 and express all four transcription factors KLF4, Sox2, cMyc, and Oct4. These cells are capable to differentiate into FAP-positive fibroblasts. It is proposed that these cells are possibly at the core of a previously unknown natural mechanism for healing injury.",

    "abstract": "Cave-dwelling ectotherms, which have evolved for millions of years under stable thermal conditions, could be expected to have adjusted their physiological limits to the narrow range of temperatures they experience and be highly vulnerable to global warming. However, the few existing studies on thermal physiology in subterranean invertebrates point that they have lost some of the thermoregulatory mechanisms common in surface species, but there is a lack of evolutionary adjustment to ambient temperature. The question remains whether this surprising homogeneous thermal niche is common for the whole subterranean biodiversity or just a peculiarity of the species tested. In order to test for the generality of such previous findings, we studied basal heat tolerance and thermal plasticity in four species of distant arthropod groups (Coleoptera, Diplopoda and Collembola) with different evolutionary histories but under similar selection pressures, as they have been exposed to the same constant environmental conditions for a long time (inhabiting the same cave). Adult specimens were exposed at different temperatures for one week to determine upper lethal temperatures. Then, surviving individuals from each treatment were exposed to a fixed stressful temperature to determine acclimation capacity. Upper lethal temperatures were similar to those reported for other subterranean species (between 20-25{degrees}C), except from that of the diplopod (28{degrees}C), widely exceeding the cave temperature (13-14{degrees}C). Acclimation responses differed from a positive acclimation response in two of the species to no acclimation capacity or detrimental acclimation effects in the others. Our results show that thermal niche features are not as homogeneous as expected across the subterranean fauna and unrelated to ambient conditions. We show that some species, likely those that colonized subterranean environments more recently, still retain thermoregulation capacity to face temperature changes. Thus, subterranean species, even those living under similar climatic conditions, might be very differently affected by global warming.",

    "abstract": "Restored tidal wetlands may provide important food web support for at-risk fish species in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) of California, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Since many tidal wetland restoration projects are planned or have recently been constructed in the Delta, understanding the diversity and variability of wetland invertebrates that are fish prey items is of increasing importance. During this study, two different invertebrate sampling techniques were tested (leaf packs and sweep nets) in four habitat types within three different wetland sites to evaluate which sampling technique provided the most reliable metric of invertebrate abundance and community composition. Sweep nets provided a better measure of fish food availability than leaf packs and were better able to differentiate between habitat types. Generalized linear models showed submerged and floating vegetation had higher abundance and species richness than channel habitats or emergent vegetation. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed significantly different communities of invertebrates in different habitat types and in different wetlands, and point-biserial correlation coefficients found a greater number of mobile taxa associated with sweep nets. There were more taxa associated with vegetated habitats than channel habitats, and one region had more taxa associated with it than the other two regions. These results suggest that restoration sites that contain multiple habitat types may enhance fish invertebrate prey diversity and resilience. However, the effect of habitat diversity must be monitored as restoration sites develop to assess actual benefits to at-risk fish species.",

    "abstract": "Particle filtering is a contemporary Sequential Monte Carlo state inference and identification methodology that allows filtering of general non-Gaussian and non-linear models in light of time series of empirical observations. Several previous lines of research have demonstrated the capacity to effectively apply particle filtering to low-dimensional compartmental transmission models. We demonstrate here implementation and evaluation of particle filtering to more complex compartmental transmission models for pertussis - including application with models involving 1, 2, and 32 age groups and with two distinct functional forms for contact matrices - using over 35 years of monthly and annual pre-vaccination provincial data from the mid-western Canadian province. Following evaluation of the predictive accuracy of these four particle filtering models, we then performed prediction, intervention experiments and outbreak classification analysis based on the most accurate model. Using that model, we contribute the first full-paper description of particle filter-informed intervention evaluation in health. We conclude that applying particle filtering with relatively high-dimensional pertussis transmission models, and incorporating time series of reported counts, can serve as a valuable technique to assist public health authorities in predicting pertussis outbreak evolution and classify whether there will be an outbreak or not in the next month (Area under the ROC Curve of 0.9) in the context of even aggregate monthly incoming empirical data. Within this use, the particle filtering models can moreover perform counterfactual analysis of interventions to assist the public health authorities in intervention planning. With its grounding in an understanding of disease mechanisms and a representation of the latent state of the system, when compared with other emerging applications of artificial intelligence techniques in outbreak projection, this technique further offers the advantages of high explanatory value and support for investigation of counterfactual scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Many species of bacteria collectively sense and respond to their social and physical environment via  quorum sensing (QS), a communication system controlling extracellular cooperative traits. Despite detailed understanding of the mechanisms of signal production and response, there remains considerable debate over the functional role(s) of QS: in short, what is it for? Experimental studies have found support for diverse functional roles: density sensing, mass-transfer sensing, genotype sensing, etc. While consistent with theory, these results cannot separate whether these functions were drivers of QS adaption, or simply artifacts or  spandrels of systems shaped by distinct ecological pressures. The challenge of separating spandrels from drivers of adaptation is particularly hard to address using extant bacterial species with poorly understood current ecologies (let alone their ecological histories). To understand the relationship between environmental challenges and trajectories of QS evolution, we used an agent-based simulation modeling approach. Given genetic mixing, our simulations produce behaviors that recapitulate features of diverse microbial QS systems, including coercive (high signal / low response) and generalized reciprocity (signal auto-regulation) strategists -- that separately and in combination contribute to QS-dependent resilience of QS-controlled cooperation in the face of diverse cheats. We contrast our in silico results with bacterial QS architectures that have evolved under largely unknown ecological contexts, highlighting the critical role of genetic constraints in shaping the shorter term (experimental evolution) dynamics of QS. More broadly, we see experimental evolution of digital organisms as a complementary tool in the search to understand the emergence of complex QS architectures and functions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBacteria communicate and cooperate using complex cell-cell signaling systems known as quorum-sensing (QS). While the molecular mechanisms are often well understood, the reasons why bacteria use QS are less clear -- how has QS aided survival and growth? The answer to this question is dependent on the environment of adaptation, and unfortunately our current understanding of QS bacterial ecology is broadly lacking. To address this gap, we studied the evolution of  digital organisms, individual-based computer simulations of bacterial populations evolving under defined environmental contexts. Our results pinpoint how simple environmental challenges (variable density and genetic mixing) can lead to the emergence of complex strategies that recapitulate features of bacterial QS, and open a path towards reverse-engineering the environmental drivers of QS.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMagnetic resonance tomography typically applies the Fourier transform to k-space signals repeatedly acquired from a frequency encoded spatial region of interest, therefore requiring a stationary object during scanning. Any movement of the object results in phase errors in the recorded signal, leading to deformed images, phantoms, and artifacts, since the encoded information does not originate from the intended region of the object. However, if the type and magnitude of movement is known instantaneously, the scanner or the reconstruction algorithm could be adjusted to compensate for the movement, directly allowing high quality imaging with non-stationary objects. This would be an enormous boon to studies that tie cell metabolomics to spontaneous organism behaviour, eliminating the stress otherwise necessitated by restraining measures such as anesthesia or clamping.\\n\\nIn the present theoretical study, we use a phantom of the animal model C. elegans to examine the feasibility to automatically predict its movement and position, and to evaluate the impact of movement prediction, within a sufficiently long time horizon, on image reconstruction. For this purpose, we use automated image processing to annotate body parts in freely moving C. elegans, and predict their path of movement. We further introduce an MRI simulation platform based on brightfield-videos of the moving worm, combined with a stack of high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) slice images as virtual high resolution phantoms. A phantom provides an indication of the spatial distribution of signal-generating nuclei on a particular imaging slice. We show that adjustment of the scanning to the predicted movements strongly reduces distortions in the resulting image, opening the door for implementation in a high-resolution NMR scanner.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOur previous studies indicated that hyperthermia may play a role in differentiation of neural stem cells and that hypoxia inducible factor-1(HIF-1) was critical in this process. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is one of the most common heat-related proteins and involved in HIF-1 expression by regulating its activity and stabilization. Here, we hypothesized that HSP90 may be involved in regulation of hyperthermia-driven differentiation of neural stem cells(NSCs). We also investigated whether the HSP90 activity exert its regulatory action via HIF-1 pathway and the transcriptional level of the target genes of HIF-1.\\n\\nMethodThe cultured NSCs were divided into three groups: an hyperthermic treatment group(40NSC) which NSCs was induced under 40{degrees}C temperature; a control group(37NSC) which NSCs was induced under 37{degrees}C temperature; an hyperthermic treatment and HSP90-inhibited group(40NSC+GA) which NSCs was induced with 0.5M HSP90 inhibitor Geldanamycin(GA) under 40{degrees}C temperature. We examined cells HSPa and HIF-1a expression during a time window of 5 days(12h, 1d, 3d, 5d) post-differentiation. The expression HSP, HIF-1, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and erythmpoietin(EPO) of during a time window was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The proportion of Tuj-1 positive differentiated cells were observed by flow cytometry.\\n\\nResultHyperthermia promoted neuronal differentiation of NSC, and this effect could be blocked by HSP90 inhibitor GA. We observed the up-regulation of HSP90 during hyperthermia treatment, and that the protein levels of HIF-1 changed depending of the GA treatment. GA could not inhibited HSP90 expression but suppressed HSP activity and decreased the expression HIF-1 protein. Inhibition of HIF-1 expression by GA could consequently affect expression of its targeted genes such as VEGF and EPO.\\n\\nConclusionHyperthermia promote differentiation of NSCs into neurons.

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) has greatly contributed to understanding and predicting the way proteins fold. However, the time-scale and complexity of folding are not accessible via classical MD. Furthermore, efficient folding pipelines involving enhanced MD techniques are not routinely accessible. We aimed to determine whether perturbing the electrostatic component of the MD force field can help expedite folding simulations. We developed charge-perturbation dynamics (CPD), an MD-based simulation approach that involves periodically perturbing the atomic charges to values non-native to the MD force field. CPD obtains suitable sampling via multiple iterations in which a classical MD segment (with native charges) is followed by a very short segment of perturbed MD (using the same force field and conditions, but with non-native charges); subsequently, partially folded intermediates are refined via a longer segment of classical MD. Among the partially folded structures from low-energy regions of the free-energy landscape sampled, the lowest-energy conformer with high root-mean-square deviation to the starting structure and low radius of gyration is defined as the folded structure. Upon benchmark testing, we found that medium-length peptides such as an alanine-based pentadecapeptide, an amyloid-{beta} peptide, and the tryptophan-cage mini-protein can fold starting from their extended linear structure in under 45 ns of CPD (total simulation time), versus over 100 ns of classical MD. CPD not only achieved folding close to the desired conformation but also sampled key intermediates along the folding pathway without prior knowledge of the folding mechanism or final folded structure. Our findings confirmed that perturbing the electrostatic component of the classical MD force field can help expedite folding simulations without changing the MD algorithm or using expensive computing architectures. CPD can be employed to probe the folding dynamics of known, putative, or planned peptides, as well as to improve sampling in more advanced simulations or to guide further experiments.\\n\\nAuthor summaryFolding represents the process by which proteins assemble into biologically active conformations. While computational techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD) have provided invaluable insight into protein folding, efficient folding pipelines are not routinely accessible. In MD, the behavior of the studied molecule is simulated under the concerted action of multiple forces described by mathematical functions employing optimized parameters. Using non-native parameters effectively perturbs the MD force field. We show that this can be exploited to help expedite folding simulations. Specifically, we developed charge-perturbation dynamics (CPD), an MD-based simulation approach that involves periodically perturbing the force field by using non-native atomic charges. For folding medium-length peptides such as the tryptophan-cage mini-protein starting from the extended linear structure, CPD is much faster than other MD-based approaches while using the same software, hardware, and know-how required for running classical MD simulations. Furthermore, CPD not only achieves folding close to the desired conformation but also samples key intermediates along the folding pathway without prior knowledge of the folding mechanism or final folded structure. CPD can be employed to probe the folding dynamics of known, putative, or planned peptides, as well as to generate different conformations that can guide further experiments or more advanced simulations.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism in the generation of transcript diversity across mammals. AS patterns are dynamically regulated during development and in response to environmental changes. Defects or perturbations in its regulation may lead to cancer or neurological disorders, among other pathological conditions. The regulatory mechanisms controlling AS in a given biological context are typically inferred using a two step-framework: differential AS analysis followed by enrichment methods. These strategies require setting rather arbitrary thresholds and are prone to error propagation along the analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose dSreg, a Bayesian model that integrates RNAseq with data from regulatory features, e.g. binding sites of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). dSreg identifies the key underlying regulators controlling AS changes and quantifies their activity while simultaneously estimating the changes in exon inclusion rates. dSreg increased both the sensitivity and the specificity of the identified alternative splicing changes in simulated data, even at low read coverage. dSreg also showed improved performance when analyzing a collection of knock-down RBPs experiments from ENCODE, as opposed to traditional enrichment methods such as Over-representation Analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). dSreg opens the possibility to integrate a large amount of readily available RNA-seq datasets at low coverage for AS analysis and allows more cost-effective RNA-seq experiments. dSreg was implemented in python using stan and is freely available to the community at https://bitbucket.org/cmartiga/dsreg.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods to predict protein structure from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) restraints that only require assignment of backbone signals hold great potential to study larger proteins and complexes. Additionally, computational methods designed to work with sparse data add atomic detail that is missing in the experimental restraints, allowing application to systems that are difficult to investigate. While specific frameworks in the Rosetta macromolecular modeling suite support the use of certain NMR restraint types, use of all commonly measured restraint types together is precluded. Here, we introduce a comprehensive framework into Rosetta that reconciles CS-Rosetta, PCS-Rosetta and RosettaNMR into a single framework, that, in addition to backbone chemical shifts and nuclear Overhauser effect distance restraints, leverages NMR restraints derived from paramagnetic labeling. Specifically, RosettaNMR incorporates pseudocontact shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements, measured at multiple tagging sites. We further showcase the generality of RosettaNMR for various modeling challenges and benchmark it on 28 structure prediction cases, eight symmetric assemblies, two protein-protein and three protein-ligand docking examples. Paramagnetic restraints generated more accurate models for 85% of the benchmark proteins and, when combined with chemical shifts, sampled high-accuracy models ([&le;] 2[A]) in 50% of the cases.\\n\\nSignificance StatementComputational methods such as Rosetta can assist NMR structure determination by employing efficient conformational search algorithms alongside physically realistic energy functions to model protein structure from sparse experimental data. We have developed a framework in Rosetta that leverages paramagnetic NMR data in addition to chemical shift and nuclear Overhauser effect restraints and extends RosettaNMR calculations to the prediction of symmetric assemblies, protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes. RosettaNMR generated high-accuracy models ([&le;] 2[A]) in 50% of cases for a benchmark set of 28 monomeric and eight symmetric proteins and predicted protein-protein and protein-ligand interfaces with up to 1[A] accuracy. The method expands Rosettas rich toolbox for integrative data-driven modeling and promises to be broadly useful in structural biology.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods that produce accurate protein structure models from limited experimental data, e.g. from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, hold great potential for biomedical research. The NMR-assisted modeling challenge in CASP13 provided a blind test to explore the capabilities and limitations of current modeling techniques in leveraging NMR data which had high sparsity, ambiguity and error rate for protein structure prediction. We describe our approach to predict the structure of these proteins leveraging the Rosetta software suite. Protein structure models were predicted de novo using a two-stage protocol. First, low-resolution models were generated with the Rosetta de novo method guided by non-ambiguous nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) contacts and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints. Second, iterative model hybridization and fragment insertion with the Rosetta comparative modeling method was used to refine and regularize models guided by all ambiguous and non-ambiguous NOE contacts and RDCs. Nine out of 16 of the Rosetta de novo models had the correct fold (GDT-TS score >45) and in three cases high-resolution models were achieved (RMSD <3.5 [A]). We also show that a meta-approach applying iterative Rosetta+NMR refinement on server-predicted models which employed non-NMR-contacts and structural templates leads to substantial improvement in model quality. Integrating these data-assisted refinement strategies with innovative non-data-assisted approaches which became possible in CASP13 such as high precision contact prediction will in the near future enable structure determination for large proteins that are outside of the realm of conventional NMR.",

    "abstract": "Ion channels can regulate the plasma membrane potential (Vm) and cell migration as a result of altered ion flux. However, the mechanism by which Vm regulates motility remains unclear. Here, we show that the Nav1.5 sodium channel carries persistent inward Na+ current which depolarizes the resting Vm at the timescale of minutes. This Nav1.5-dependent Vm depolarization increases Rac1 colocalization with phosphatidylserine, to which it is anchored at the leading edge of migrating cells, promoting Rac1 activation. A genetically-encoded FRET biosensor of Rac1 activation shows that depolarization-induced Rac1 activation results in acquisition of a motile phenotype. By identifying Nav1.5-mediated Vm depolarization as a regulator of Rac1 activation, we link ionic and electrical signaling at the plasma membrane to small GTPase-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular migration. We uncover a novel and unexpected mechanism for Rac1 activation, which fine tunes cell migration in response to ionic and/or electric field changes in the local microenvironment.",

Numerous strategies to reduce unwanted cleavage have been devised, but all are imperfect. Here, we report off-target sites can be shielded from the active Cas9*single guide RNA (sgRNA) complex through the co-administration of dead-RNAs (dRNAs), truncated guide RNAs that direct Cas9 binding but not cleavage. dRNAs can effectively suppress a wide-range of off-targets with minimal optimization while preserving on-target editing, and they can be multiplexed to suppress several off-targets simultaneously. dRNAs can be combined with high-specificity Cas9 variants, which often do not eliminate all unwanted editing. Moreover, dRNAs can prevent cleavage of homology-directed repair (HDR)-corrected sites, facilitating \\\"scarless\\\" editing by eliminating the need for blocking mutations. Thus, we enable precise genome editing by establishing a novel and flexible approach for suppressing unwanted editing of both off-targets and HDR-corrected sites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfluenza viruses are associated with a significant global public health burden. The segmented RNA genome of influenza changes continually due to mutation, and the accumulation of these changes within the antigenic recognition sites of haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) in turn leads to annual epidemics. Influenza A is also zoonotic, allowing for exchange of segments between human and non-human viruses, resulting in new strains with pandemic potential. These processes necessitate a global surveillance system for influenza monitoring. To this end, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has begun to emerge as a useful tool. However, due to the diversity and mutability of the influenza genome, and noise in short-read data, bioinformatics processing can present challenges.\\n\\nResultsConventional mapping approaches can be insufficient when a sub-optimal reference strain is chosen. For short-read datasets simulated from influenza H1N1 HA sequences, read recovery after single-reference mapping was routinely as low as 90% for human-origin influenza sequences, and often lower than 10% for those from avian hosts. To this end, we developed a de Bruijn Graph (DBG)-based classifier of influenza WGS datasets: VAPOR. In real data benchmarking using 257 WGS read sets with corresponding de novo assemblies, VAPOR provided classifications for all samples with a mean of >99.8% identity to assembled contigs. This resulted in an increase in the number of mapped reads by 6.8% on average, up to a maximum of 13.3%. Additionally, using simulations, we demonstrate that classification from reads may be applied to detection of reassorted strains.\\n\\nConclusionsVAPOR has potential to simplify bioinformatics pipelines for surveillance, providing a novel method for detection of influenza strains of human and non-human origin directly from reads, minimization of potential data loss and bias associated with conventional mapping, and allowing visualization of alignments that would otherwise require slow de novo assembly. Whilst with expertise and time these pitfalls can largely be avoided, with pre-classification they are remedied in a single step. Furthermore, our algorithm could be adapted in future to surveillance of other RNA viruses. VAPOR is available at https://github.com/connor-lab/vapor.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have known roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of various biological processes including ovarian follicle development. We have previously identified miRNAs from human pre-ovulatory granulosa cells that are expressed from the intronic regions of two key genes in normal follicular development: FSH receptor (FSHR) and CYP19A1, the latter encoding the aromatase enzyme. In the present study, we aim to identify the targets regulated by those two miRNAs: hsa-miR-548ba and hsa-miR-7973, respectively. The miRNAs of interest were endogenously expressed in KGN cell-line, gene expression changes were analyzed by Affymetrix microarray and confirmed by RT-qPCR. Potential miRNA-regulated sequences were further filtered from the obtained results by bioinformatic target prediction algorithms and validated for direct miRNA:mRNA binding by luciferase reporter assay. Our results verified Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), Neogenin 1 (NEO1) and SP110 nuclear body protein (SP110) as target genes for hsa-miR-548ba. Hsa-miR-7973 target genes ADAM metallopeptidase domain 19 (ADAM19), Peroxidasin (PXDN) and Formin like 3 (FMNL3) also passed all verification steps. In conclusion we propose that hsa-miR-548ba may be involved in the regulation of follicle growth and activation via LIFR and PTEN. Hsa-miR-7973 may be implicated in the modulation of extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions. Taken together, our results suggest that those two miRNAs of interest have important regulatory roles in granulosa cells and in follicle development in general.\\n\\nSummary sentenceConfirmed targets of miRNAs hsa-miR-548ba and hsa-miR-7973 are involved in follicle recruitment, apoptosis, intercellular interactions and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways in KGN cells.",

    "abstract": "Naturally-occurring cell death is a fundamental developmental mechanism for regulating cell numbers and sculpting developing organs. This is particularly true in the central nervous system, where large numbers of neurons and oligodendrocytes are eliminated via apoptosis during normal development. Given the profound impact of death upon these two major cell populations, it is surprising that developmental death of another major cell type - the astrocyte - has rarely been studied. It is presently unclear whether astrocytes are subject to significant amounts of developmental death, or how it occurs. Here we address these questions using mouse retinal astrocytes as our model system. We show that the total number of retinal astrocytes declines by over 3-fold during a death period spanning postnatal days 5-14. Surprisingly, these astrocytes do not die by apoptosis, the canonical mechanism underlying the vast majority of developmental cell death. Instead, we find that microglia kill and engulf astrocytes to mediate their developmental removal. Genetic ablation of microglia inhibits astrocyte death, leading to a larger astrocyte population size at the end of the death period. However, astrocyte death is not completely blocked in the absence of microglia, apparently due to the ability of astrocytes to engulf each other. Nevertheless, mice lacking microglia showed significant anatomical changes to the retinal astrocyte network, with functional consequences for the astrocyte-associated vasculature leading to retinal hemorrhage. These results establish a novel modality for naturally-occurring cell death, and demonstrate its importance for formation and integrity of the retinal gliovascular network.",

    "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a genetically, epigenetically, and clinically heterogeneous disease. Despite this heterogeneity, the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib provides effective treatment for the vast majority of CLL patients. To define the underlining regulatory program, we analyzed high-resolution time courses of ibrutinib treatment in closely monitored patients, combining cellular phenotyping (flow cytometry), single-cell transcriptome profiling (scRNA-seq), and chromatin mapping (ATAC-seq). We identified a consistent regulatory program shared across all patients, which was further validated by an independent CLL cohort. In CLL cells, this program starts with a sharp decrease of NF-{kappa}B binding, followed by reduced regulatory activity of lineage-defining transcription factors (including PAX5 and IRF4) and erosion of CLL cell identity, finally leading to the acquisition of a quiescence-like gene signature which was shared across several immune cell types. Nevertheless, we observed patient-to-patient variation in the speed of its execution, which we exploited to predict patient-specific dynamics in the response to ibrutinib based on pre-treatment samples. In aggregate, our study describes the cellular, molecular, and regulatory effects of therapeutic B cell receptor inhibition in CLL at high temporal resolution, and it establishes a broadly applicable method for epigenome/transcriptome-based treatment monitoring.",

We explored longitudinal changes in CpG methylation from blood leukocytes, and likelihood of a future cancer diagnosis.\\n\\nMethodsPeripheral blood samples were obtained at baseline and at follow-up visit from 20 participants in the Health, Aging and Body Composition prospective cohort study. Genome-wide CpG methylation was assayed using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC (HM850K) microarray.\\n\\nResultsGlobal patterns in DNA methylation from CpG-based analyses showed extensive changes in cell composition over time in participants who developed cancer. By visit year 6, the proportion of CD8+ T-cells decreased (p-value = 0.02), while granulocytes cell levels increased (p-value = 0.04) among participants diagnosed with cancer compared to those who remained cancer-free (cancer-free vs. cancer-present: 0.03 {+/-} 0.02 vs. 0.003 {+/-} 0.005 for CD8+ T-cells; 0.52 {+/-} 0.14 vs. 0.66 {+/-} 0.09 for granulocytes).

    "abstract": "Podocytes are integral members of the filtration barrier in the kidney and are crucial for glomerular permselectivity. Podocytes are highly differentiated and vulnerable to an array of noxious stimuli during various clinical conditions whereas podocyte loss plays a key role in progressive glomerular diseases. Elevated circulating growth hormone (GH) levels are associated with podocyte injury and proteinuria in diabetics. Previous studies have shown that podocytes express GH receptors (GHR), and induce Notch signaling when exposed to GH. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which excess GH elicits podocytopathy remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that GH induces cognate TGF-{beta}1 signaling and provokes cell cycle re-entry of otherwise quiescent podocytes. Though, differentiated podocytes re-enter the cell cycle in response to GH and TGF-{beta}1 unable to accomplish cytokinesis, despite nuclear division. Owing to this aberrant cell-cycle events significant amount of GH or TGF-{beta}1 treated cells remain binucleated and undergo mitotic catastrophe. Importantly, inhibition of GHR, TGFBR1, or Notch signaling prevented cell cycle re-entry and protects podocyte from cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of Notch activation prevents GH-dependent podocyte injury and proteinuria. Kidney biopsy sections from patients with diabetic nephropathy show activation of Notch signaling and bi-nucleated podocytes. All these data confirm that excess GH induces Notch1 signaling via TGF-{beta}1 and contributes to the mitotic catastrophe of podocytes. This study highlights the role of aberrant GH signaling in the podocytopathy and the potential application of inhibitors of TGF-{beta}1 or Notch inhibitors as a therapeutic agent for diabetic nephropathy.\n\nSignificance StatementElevated circulating levels of growth hormone (GH) associated with glomerular hypertrophy and proteinuria. Whereas decreased GH action protected against proteinuria. Podocytes are highly differentiated cells that play a vital role in glomerular filtration and curb protein loss. The direct role of GH in podocytes is the focus of our study. We found that GH induces TGF-{beta}1 and both provoke cell cycle re-entry of podocytes in Notch1 dependent manner. Notch activation enables the podocytes to accomplish karyokinesis, but not cytokinesis owing to which podocytes remain binucleated. Binucleated podocytes that were observed during GH/TGF-{beta}1 treatment are susceptible to cell death. Our study highlighted the fact that enforcing the differentiated podocytes to re-enter the cell cycle results in mitotic catastrophe and permanent loss.",

    "abstract": "KIF1A is a kinesin-family motor involved in the axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) along microtubules. In humans, more than ten point mutations in KIF1A are associated with the motor neuron disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG). However, not all of these mutations appear to inhibit the motility of the KIF1A motor, and thus, a clear molecular explanation for how KIF1A mutations lead to neuropathy is not available. In this study, we established in vitro motility assays with purified full-length human KIF1A and found that KIF1A mutations associated with the pure form of spastic paraplegia hyperactivate motility of the KIF1A motor. Introduction of the corresponding mutations into Caenorhabditis elegans KIF1A homologue unc-104 revealed abnormal accumulation of SVPs at the tips of axons and increased anterograde axonal transport of SVPs. Our data reveal that hyper-activation of kinesin motor activity, rather than its loss-of-function, is a novel cause of motor neuron disease in humans.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAnterograde axonal transport supplies organelles and protein complexes throughout axonal processes to support neuronal morphology and function. It has been observed that reduced anterograde axonal transport is associated with neuronal diseases. In contrast, here we show that particular disease-associated mutations in KIF1A, an anterograde axonal motor for synaptic vesicle precursors, induce hyperactivation of KIF1A motor activity and increased axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors. Our results advance the knowledge of the regulation of motor proteins and axonal transport and cell biology of motor neuron diseases.",

    "abstract": "The recruitment of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to gene promoters is critical for its function in repressing gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, previous studies have demonstrated although the expression of early lineage-specific genes is largely repressed, the genome-wide PRC2 occupancy is unexpectedly reduced in naive mESCs. In this study, we provide evidence to show the FGF/ERK signaling determines the global PRC2 occupancy through regulating the expression of PRC2-recruting factor JARID2 in naive mESCs. At the transcriptional level, the de-repression of bivalent genes is predominantly determined by the presence of cell signaling-associated transcription factors but not the status of PRC2 occupancy at gene promoters. Hence, this study not only reveals a key molecular mechanism by which the FGF/ERK signaling in regulating the PRC2 occupancy in mESCs, but also elucidates a fundamental question regarding the functional roles of transcription factors and Polycomb-mediated epigenetic mechanisms in transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "One of the strategies of integrated vector management is to lure gravid mosquitoes for surveillance purposes or to entice them to lay eggs in water containing toxins that kill the offspring (attract-and-kill or trap-and-kill). Typically, the major challenge of this approach is the development of a lure that stimulates oviposition plus a toxin with no deterrent effect. Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) satisfies the latter criterion, but lures for these autocidal gravid traps are sorely needed. We observed that gravid Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus laid significantly more eggs in cups with extracts from 4th-stage larvae (4L) of the same or different species. No activity was found when 4L were extracted with hexane, diethyl ether, methanol, or butanol, but activity was observed with dimethyl sulfoxide extracts. Larval extracts contained both oviposition stimulant(s)/attractant(s) and deterrent(s), which partitioned in the water and hexane phases, respectively. Lyophilized larval extracts were active after a month, but activity was reduced by keeping the sample at 4{degrees}C. In the tested range of 0.1 to 1 larvae-equivalent per milliliter, oviposition activity increased in a dose-dependent manner. In field experiments, Ae. aegpti laid significantly more eggs in traps loaded with larval extracts plus Bti than in control traps with water plus Bti.",

While many methods to study eukaryotic (m)RNPs rely on purification of polyadenylated RNA, other important regulatory RNA classes or bacterial mRNA could not be investigated at the same depth. To overcome this limitation, we developed Phenol Toluol extraction (PTex), a novel and unbiased method for the purification of UV cross-linked RNPs in living cells. PTex is a fast (2-3 hrs) and simple protocol. The purification principle is solely based on physicochemical properties of cross-linked RNPs, enabling us to interrogate RNA-protein interactions system-wide and beyond poly(A) RNA from a variety of species and source material. Here, we are presenting an introduction of the underlying separation principles and give a detailed discussion of the individual steps as well as incorporation of PTex in high-throughput pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation DNA sequencing is currently limited by an inability to count the number of input DNA molecules. Molecular counting is particularly needed when accurate quantification is required for diagnostic purposes, such as in single-gene non-invasive prenatal testing (sgNIPT) and liquid biopsy. We developed Quantitative Counting Template (QCT) molecular counting for reconstructing the number of input DNA molecules using sequencing data. We then used QCT molecular counting to develop sgNIPT of sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, alpha-thalassemia, and beta-thalassemia. Incorporating molecular count information into a statistical model of disease likelihood led to analytical sensitivity and specificity of >98% and >99%, respectively. Validation of sgNIPT was further performed with maternal blood samples collected during pregnancy, and sgNIPT was 100% concordant with newborn follow-up.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThrough precise implementation of distinct cell type specification programs, differentially regulated in both space and time, complex patterns emerge during organogenesis. Thanks to its easy experimental accessibility, the developing chicken limb has long served as a paradigm to study vertebrate pattern formation. Through decades worth of research, we now have a firm grasp on the molecular mechanisms driving limb formation at the tissue-level. However, to elucidate the dynamic interplay between transcriptional cell type specification programs and pattern formation at its relevant cellular scale, we lack appropriately resolved molecular data at the genome-wide level. Here, making use of droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing, we catalogue the developmental emergence of distinct tissue types and their transcriptome dynamics in the distal chicken limb, the so-called autopod, at cellular resolution.\\n\\nResultsUsing single-cell RNA-sequencing technology, we sequenced a total of 17,628 cells coming from three key developmental stages of chicken autopod patterning. Overall, we identified 23 cell populations with distinct transcriptional profiles. Amongst them were small, albeit essential populations like the apical ectodermal ridge, demonstrating the ability to detect even rare cell types. Moreover, we uncovered the existence of molecularly distinct sub-populations within previously defined compartments of the developing limb, some of which have important signaling functions during autopod pattern formation. Finally, we inferred gene co-expression modules that coincide with distinct tissue types across developmental time, and used them to track patterning-relevant cell populations of the forming digits.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive functional genomics resource to study the molecular effectors of chicken limb patterning at cellular resolution. Our single-cell transcriptomic atlas captures all major cell populations of the developing autopod, and highlights the transcriptional complexity in many of its components. Finally, integrating our data-set with other single-cell transcriptomics resources will enable researchers to assess molecular similarities in orthologous cell types across the major tetrapod clades, and provide an extensive candidate gene list to functionally test cell-type-specific drivers of limb morphological diversification.",

    "abstract": "Hun, Avar and conquering Hungarian nomadic groups arrived into the Carpathian Basin from the Eurasian Steppes and significantly influenced its political and ethnical landscape. In order to shed light on the genetic affinity of above groups we have determined Y chromosomal haplogroups and autosomal loci, from 49 individuals, supposed to represent military leaders. Haplogroups from the Hun-age are consistent with Xiongnu ancestry of European Huns. Most of the Avar-age individuals carry east Eurasian Y haplogroups typical for modern north-eastern Siberian and Buryat populations and their autosomal loci indicate mostly unmixed Asian characteristics. In contrast the conquering Hungarians seem to be a recently assembled population incorporating pure European, Asian and admixed components. Their heterogeneous paternal and maternal lineages indicate similar phylogeographic origin of males and females, derived from Central-Inner Asian and European Pontic Steppe sources. Composition of conquering Hungarian paternal lineages is very similar to that of Baskhirs, supporting historical sources that report identity of the two groups.",

However, we know little about microbiome responses to long-lasting environmental and host-centred processes, which require studying microbiome changes through time. Here, we apply a temporal metagenomics approach to dental calculus, the calcified oral microbial biofilm. We establish dental calculus as a valuable tool for the study of host microbiome evolution by characterising the taxonomic and functional composition of the oral microbiome in a variety of wild mammals. We detect oral pathogens in individuals with evidence of oral disease, assemble near-complete bacterial genomes from historical specimens, characterise antibiotic resistance genes even before the advent of industrial antibiotic production, reconstruct components of the host diet and recover host genetic profiles. Our work demonstrates how dental calculus can be used in the future to study the evolution of oral microbiomes and pathogens, and the impact of anthropogenic changes on wildlife and the environment.",
