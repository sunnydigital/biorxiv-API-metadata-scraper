    "abstract": "Autophagy is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved, process in which cytoplasmic material is degraded through the lysosomal pathway [1-7]. One of the most important and well-studied autophagy-related proteins is LC3 [Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, (called Atg8 in yeast and Drosophila)], which participates in autophagosome formation and autophagy cargo selection in the cytoplasm, and is one of the most widely utilized markers of autophagy [8, 9]. Despite growing evidence that LC3 is enriched in the nucleus, little is known about the mechanisms involved in targeting LC3 to the nucleus and the nuclear components it interacts with [10-13]. Here we show that Drosophila Atg8a protein, homologous to mammalian LC3 and yeast Atg8, interacts with the transcription factor Sequoia in a LIR-motif dependent manner. We show that Sequoia depletion induces autophagy in nutrient rich conditions through enhanced expression of autophagy genes. We also show that Atg8a interacts with YL-1, a component of a nuclear acetyltransferase complex, and is acetylated at position K46. Additionally, we show that Atg8a interacts with the deacetylase Sir2, which deacetylates Atg8a during starvation in order to activate autophagy. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation of expression of autophagy genes by Atg8a, which is linked to its acetylation status and its interaction with Sequoia, YL-1 and Sir2.",

    "abstract": "Decreased aortic compliance is associated with ageing and vascular disease, including atherosclerosis and hypertension. Ultimately, changes in aortic compliance are driven by altered ECM composition however, recent findings have identified a cellular component to decreased aortic compliance observed in ageing and hypertension. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) line the blood vessel wall and VSMC contraction regulates vascular tone and contributes to aortic compliance. Mechanical cues derived from the ECM influence VSMC function, yet whether ECM rigidity influences VSMC force generation remains unclear. In this study, we describe the relationship between VSMC spreading, traction force magnitude and matrix rigidity. Importantly, we show that spreading predicts integrated traction force (integrated-TF) magnitude independently of matrix rigidity. Using linear regression analysis, we have generated a model for calculating integrated-TF from VSMC area. This model closely predicts the integrated traction force measured by live VSMC traction force microscopy. Vinculin staining analysis revealed that spreading strongly correlated with adhesion number per VSMC, suggesting that increased VSMC integrated-TF was due to enhanced matrix anchor points. Further analysis revealed that calculated integrated-TF per adhesion was reduced by matrix rigidity, however, adhesion number/m2 increased, resulting in the average integrated-TF/m2 remaining unaltered. As a result, the integrated-TF/VSMC spreading relationship is independent of matrix rigidity. Therefore, our study has identified and validated a novel model to predict and understand the mechanisms influencing VSMC traction force magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) modulate gene expression as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) via sponging microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the extent and functional consequences of ceRNAs in diverse cellular context still need to be proven. Using a doxycycline inducible expression of Yamanaka four factors to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we found the miRNAs from MEFs remained highly expressed from day 0 to day 6 after doxycycline induction; unexpectedly, many genes targeted by these miRNAs were actually up-regulated; meanwhile, long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) which have complementary binding sites with the miRNAs were highly expressed, indicating lincRNAs and circRNAs (linc/circRNAs) may serve as sponges for miRNAs to block their activities during reprogramming. Intriguingly, the knockdown of the linc/circRNAs sponging the miRNAs targeting Oct4 mRNA resulted in down-regulation of exogenous Oct4 expression, decrease of reprogramming efficiency, and low-grade chimera forming iPSCs. Our results suggest that the ceRNA network plays an important role in reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Specific communication between gene promoters and enhancers is critical for accurate regulation of gene expression. However, it remains unclear how specific interactions between multiple regulatory elements and genes contained within a single chromatin domain are coordinated. Recent technological advances allow for the investigation of multi-way chromatin interactions at single alleles in individual nuclei. This can provide insights into how multiple regulatory elements cooperate or compete for transcriptional activation. We have used these techniques in a mouse model in which the -globin domain is extended to include several additional genes. This allows us to determine how the interactions of the -globin super-enhancer are distributed between multiple promoters in a single domain. Our data show that gene promoters do not form mutually exclusive interactions with the super-enhancer, but all interact simultaneously in a single complex. These finding show that promoters within the same domain do not structurally compete for interactions with enhancers, but form a regulatory hub structure, consistent with the recent model of transcriptional activation in phase-separated nuclear condensates.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoke first interacts with the lung through the cellularly diverse airway epithelium and goes on to drive development of most chronic lung diseases. Here, through single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of the tracheal epithelium from smokers and nonsmokers, we generated a comprehensive atlas of epithelial cell types and states, connected these into lineages, and defined cell-specific responses to smoking. Our analysis inferred multi-state lineages that develop into surface mucus secretory and ciliated cells and contrasted these to the unique lineage and specialization of submucosal gland (SMG) cells. Our analysis also suggests a lineage relationship between tuft, pulmonary neuroendocrine, and the newly discovered CFTR-rich ionocyte cells. Our smoking analysis found that all cell types, including protected stem and SMG populations, are affected by smoking, through both pan-epithelial smoking response networks and hundreds of cell type-specific response genes, redefining the penetrance and cellular specificity of smoking effects on the human airway epithelium.",

    "abstract": "The cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton, including the sarcomeric contractile apparatus, forms a cohesive network with cellular adhesions at the plasma membrane and nuclear-cytoskeletal linkages (LINC complexes) at the nuclear envelope. Human cardiomyopathies are genetically linked to the LINC complex and A-type lamins, but an full understanding of disease etiology in these patients is lacking. Here we show SUN2-null mice display cardiac hypertrophy coincident with enhanced AKT/MAPK signaling, as has been described previously for mice lacking A-type lamins. Surprisingly, in contrast to lamin A/C-null mice, SUN2-null mice fail to show coincident fibrosis or upregulation of pathological hypertrophy markers. Thus, cardiac hypertrophy is uncoupled from pro-fibrotic signaling in this mouse model, which we tie to a requirement for the LINC complex in productive TGF{beta} signaling. In the absence of SUN2, we detect elevated levels of the integral inner nuclear membrane protein MAN1, an established negative regulator of TGF{beta} signaling, at the nuclear envelope. We suggest that A-type lamins and SUN2 play antagonistic roles in the modulation of pro-fibrotic signaling through opposite effects on MAN1 levels at the nuclear lamina, suggesting a new perspective on disease etiology.",
