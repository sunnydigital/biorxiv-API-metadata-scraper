    "abstract": "NSFs Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports thousands of undergraduate researchers annually. REU sites operate independently with regards to their research mission and structure, leading to a complex educational milieu distinct from traditional classrooms and labs. Overall, REU sites are perceived as providing highly formative experiences for developing researchers. However, given improved assessment practices over REUs three decades, best practices for student learning and evaluation of long-term impacts remain limited. To address this limitation, we recommend the use of systems-based theoretical frameworks when studying REU programs. We outline how one such framework, cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), could inform the collection of assessment data. Among other strengths, CHAT guides collection of quantitative and qualitative information that can help characterize REU programs in an educationally meaningful context. Adoption of CHAT and similar approaches by REU Sites could improve dialogue among programs, encourage collaborations, and improve evidence-based practices.",

    "abstract": "Artificial nanoparticles accumulate a protein corona layer in biological fluids, which significantly influences their bioactivity. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (A{beta}42), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimers disease, in-vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDivide-and-conquer methods, which divide the species set into over-lapping subsets, construct a tree on each subset, and then combine the subset trees using a supertree method, provide a key algorithmic framework for boosting the scalability of phylogeny estimation methods to large datasets. Yet the use of supertree methods, which typically attempt to solve NP-hard optimization problems, limits the scalability of such approaches.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach that does not require supertree estimation: we divide the species set into pairwise disjoint subsets, construct a tree on each subset using a base method, and then combine the subset trees using a distance matrix. For this merger step, we present a new method, called NJMerge, which is a polynomial-time extension of Neighbor Joining (NJ); thus, NJMerge can be viewed either as a method for improving traditional NJ or as a method for scaling the base method to larger datasets. We prove that NJMerge can be used to create divide-and-conquer pipelines that are statistically consistent under some models of evolution. We also report the results of an extensive simulation study evaluating NJMerge on multi-locus datasets with up to 1000 species. We found that NJMerge sometimes improved the accuracy of traditional NJ and substantially reduced the running time of three popular species tree methods (ASTRAL-III, SVDquartets, and \\\"concatenation\\\" using RAxML) without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, although NJMerge can fail to return a tree, in our experiments, NJMerge failed on only 11 out of 2560 test cases.\\n\\nConclusionsTheoretical and empirical results suggest that NJMerge is a valuable technique for large-scale phylogeny estimation, especially when computational resources are limited.

    "abstract": "The impermeability of the luminal endothelial cell monolayer is crucial for the normal performance of the vascular and lymphatic systems. A key to this function is the integrity of the monolayers intercellular junctions. The known repertoire of junction-regulating genes is incomplete. Current permeability assays are incompatible with high-throughput genome-wide screens that could identify these genes. To overcome these limitations, we designed a new permeability assay that consists of cell monolayers grown on [~]150 m microcarriers. Each microcarrier functions as a miniature individual assay of permeability (MAP). We demonstrate that false-positive results can be minimized, and that MAP sensitivity to thrombin-induced increase in monolayer permeability is similar to the sensitivity of the measurement of impedance. We validate the assay by showing that the expression of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that target genes encoding known thrombin signaling proteins blocks effectively thrombin-induced junction disassembly, and that MAPs carrying such cells can be separated effectively by a fluorescent probe from those that carry cells expressing non-targeting sgRNAs. These results indicate that MAPs are suitable for high-throughput experimentation and for genome-wide screens for genes that mediate the disruptive effect of thrombin on endothelial cell junctions.",

    "abstract": "Although tradeoffs are expected to play an essential role in shaping the diversity in a community, their effects remain relatively nebulous and notoriously difficult to assess. This is especially true when multiple tradeoffs occur simultaneously. When dealing with single tradeoffs some information can be predicted based on their curvature. Does the same happen when dealing with multiple tradeoffs? What happens if the tradeoffs have opposing curvatures? To address these issues, we develop a resource-based model that encompasses multiple tradeoffs mediated by the acquisition and processing of the resources. The model considers a spatially structured population of microbial organisms that can grow on an arbitrary number of resources, which come into the system at a constant rate and diffuse through the environment. The individuals can adopt a variety of strategies through mutation constrained by tradeoffs, which renders the model adaptive. We assess population sizes and levels of ecological specialization. We find that when multiple tradeoffs are considered the classical intuition developed for single tradeoffs does not hold. The outcome can depend significantly not only on the curvature of the tradeoffs but also on resource availability.",

    "abstract": "Most physiology, fitness and disease phenotypes are considered complex traits since they exhibit continuous variation in natural populations. The use of homozygous inbred strains allows the assessment of the impact of genetic composition on complex phenotypes. Nevertheless, to understand gene function, we often combine transgenic lines to assess the phenotype of interest in a heterozygous state. Here, using inbred wild-type Drosophila strains, we assessed the phenotypic variation of six physiology and fitness traits: female fecundity, survival and intestinal mitosis upon oral infection, defecation rate and fecal pH upon oral infection, and terminal tracheal cell branching in hypoxia. Indeed, we found continuous variation in all traits tested. To estimate the extent to which small genetic background differences affected these traits, we assessed the effects of commonly used Drosophila UAS-RNAi transgenic strains and their backcrossed isogenized counterparts in the same assays. We tested 20 non-isogenic strains (10 KK and 10 GD) from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center and their isogenic counterparts without Gal4 induction and found that the different phenotypes were variably sensitive to the genetic background. For example, survival upon infection and female fecundity exhibited differences in 50% and 40% of the tested isogenic vs. non-isogenic pairs, respectively, whereas all other phenotypes were affected in only 10-25% of the cases. We also observed that the genetic background affects Gal4 transgenes unpredictably. Thus, depending on the trait of interest, the genetic background of commonly used transgenic strains needs to be considered carefully during experimentation.",

Due to the Heisenberg-Gabor uncertainty principle, a single measurement cannot estimate precisely the location of a finite oscillation in both time and frequency. Classical spectral estimators, like the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or the continuous-wavelet transform (CWT) optimize either temporal or frequency resolution, or find a tradeoff that is suboptimal in both dimensions. Following concepts from optical super-resolution, we introduce a new spectral estimator enabling time-frequency super-resolution. Sets of wavelets with increasing bandwidth are combined geometrically in a superlet to maintain the good temporal resolution of wavelets and gain frequency resolution in the upper bands. Superlets outperform the STFT, CWT, and other super-resolution methods on synthetic data and brain signals recorded in humans and rodents, resolving time-frequency details with unprecedented precision. Importantly, superlets can reveal transient oscillation events that are hidden in the averaged time-frequency spectrum by other methods.",

    "abstract": "Deep sequencing of transposon mutant libraries (or TnSeq) is a powerful method for probing essentiality of genomic loci under different environmental conditions. Various analytical methods have been described for identifying conditionally essential genes whose tolerance for insertions varies between two conditions. However, for large-scale experiments involving many conditions, a method is needed for identifying genes that exhibit significant variability in insertions across multiple conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical method for identifying genes with significant variability of insertion counts across multiple conditions based on Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression. Using likelihood ratio tests, we show that the ZINB fits TnSeq data better than either ANOVA or a Negative Binomial (in a generalized linear model). We use ZINB regression to identify genes required for infection of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in C57BL/6 mice. We also use ZINB to perform a retrospective analysis of genes conditionally essential in H37Rv cultures exposed to multiple antibiotics. Our results show that, not only does ZINB generally identify most of the genes found by pairwise resampling (and vastly out-performs ANOVA), but it also identifies additional genes where variability is detectable only when the magnitudes of insertion counts are treated separately from local differences in saturation, as in the ZINB model.",

To reveal the relationship between DMD and VEGF signaling, mdx mice were crossed with constitutive (CAG/CreERTM:Flt1LoxP/LoxP) and endothelial cell-specific conditional gene knockout mice (Cdh5CreERT2:Flt1LoxP/LoxP) for Flt1 which is a decoy receptor for VEGF.

These decreases in pathology, including improved muscle histology and function, were recapitulated in mdx mice given anti-FLT1 peptides or monoclonal antibodies, which blocked VEGF-FLT1 binding.

Among 125 expression signatures, five immune signatures were significantly higher in nrTNBCs while lrTNBC were enriched for eight estrogen/luminal signatures (all FDR p<0.05). There was no significant difference in tumor mutation burden or percent genome altered across the groups. Among mutations, only TP53 mutations were significantly more frequent in rrTNBC compared to lrTNBC (Fisher exact FDR p=0.009). To develop an optimal classifier, we used 77 significant clinical and  omic features to evaluate six modeling approaches encompassing simple, machine learning, and artificial neural network (ANN). Support vector machine outperformed other models with average receiver-operator characteristic area under curve >0.75.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide a new approach to define TNBCs based on timing of relapse. We identify distinct clinical and genomic features that can be incorporated into machine learning models to predict rapid relapse of TNBC.",

    "abstract": "3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is an acid-derived dimer of indole-3-carbinol, found in many cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, and has been shown to inhibit prostate cancer (PCa) in several in vitro and in vivo models. We demonstrated that DIM stimulated both estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and estrogen receptor beta (ER{beta}) transcriptional activities and propose that ER{beta} plays a role in mediating DIMs inhibition on cancer cell growth. To further study the effects of DIM on inhibiting advanced PCa development, we tested DIM in TRAMP (TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate) mice. The control group of mice were fed a high fat diet. Three additional groups of mice were fed the same high fat diet supplemented with 0.04%, 0.2% and 1% DIM. Incidence of advanced PCa, poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC), in the control group was 60%. 1% DIM dramatically reduced PDC incidence to 24% (p=0.0012), while 0.2% and 0.04% DIM reduced PDC incidence to 38% (p=0.047) and 45% (p=0.14) respectively. Though DIM did affect mice weights, statistical analysis showed a clear negative association between DIM concentration and PDC incidence with p=0.004, while the association between body weight and PDC incidence was not significant (p=0.953). In conclusion, our results show that dietary DIM can inhibit the most aggressive stage of prostate cancer at concentration lower than previously demonstrated, possibly working through an estrogen receptor mediated mechanism.",

However, analytical methods which directly detect the ratio of intracellular GTP and GDP concentrations have not been available. Herein, we report GNEPS, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that enables real-time monitoring of the GTP:GDP ratio, which is a fusion protein comprising a eukaryotic G-protein and a circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein. GNEPS has distinct fluorescence spectra between its GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. Its apparent fluorescence signal therefore depends upon the competitive binding of GTP and GDP. Live cell imaging experiments demonstrated that GNEPS can be used to monitor spatiotemporal changes in the intracellular GTP:GDP ratio in various cell types and organelles in response to metabolic perturbations.

Most of what we currently know about UNC-45A pertains to its role as a regulator of the actomyosin system. However, emerging studies from both our and other laboratories support a role of UNC-45A outside of actomyosin regulation. This includes studies showing that UNC-45A: regulates gene transcription, co-localizes and biochemically co-fractionates with gamma tubulin and regulates centrosomal positioning, is found in the same subcellular fractions where MT-associated proteins are, and is a mitotic spindle-associated protein with MT destabilizing activity in absence of the actomyosin system.\\n\\nHere, we extended our previous findings and show that UNC45A is variably expressed across a spectrum of cell lines with the highest level being found in HeLa cells and in ovarian cancer cells inherently paclitaxel-resistant. Furthermore, we show that UNC-45A is preferentially expressed in epithelial cells, localizes to mitotic spindles in clinical tumor specimens of cancer and co-localizes and co-fractionates with MTs in interphase cells independent of actin or myosin.\\n\\nIn sum, we report alteration of UNC45A localization in the setting of chemotherapeutic treatment of cells with paclitaxel, and localization of UNC45A to MTs both in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "Human natural killer (NK) cell-based adoptive anti-cancer immunotherapy has gained intense interest with many clinical trials actively recruiting patients to treat a variety of both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Most of these trials use primary NK cells isolated either from peripheral blood (PB-NK cells) or umbilical cord blood (UCB-NK cells), though these sources require NK cell collection for each patient leading to donor variability and heterogeneity in the NK cell populations. In contrast, NK cells derived human embryonic stem cells (hESC-NK cells) or induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-NK cells) provide more homogeneous cell populations that can be grown at clinical scale, and genetically engineered if desired. These characteristics make hESC/iPSC-derived NK cells an ideal cell population for developing standardized, \\\"off-the-shelf\\\" immunotherapy products. Additionally, production of NK cells from undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells enables studies to better define pathways that regulate human NK cell development and function. Our group previously established a stromal-free, two-stage culture system to derive NK cells from hESC/hiPSC in vitro followed by clinical-scale expansion of these cells using interleukin-21 expressing artificial antigen-presenting cells. However, prior to differentiation, this method requires single cell adaption of hESCs/hiPSCs which takes months. Recently we optimized this method by adapting the mouse embryonic fibroblast-dependent hESC/hiPSC to feeder-free culture conditions. These feeder-free hESC/hiPSCs are directly used to generate hemato-endothelial precursor cells. This new method produces mature, functional NK cells with higher efficiency to enable rapid production of an essentially unlimited number of homogenous NK cells that can be used for standardized, targeted immunotherapy for the treatment of refractory cancers and infectious diseases.",

The validity of the protocol is established through Brownian dynamics simulations of a single-mode spring-dashpot model for a polymer. Well-established single-molecule manipulation techniques, such as optical tweezer-based pulling, can be used to implement the suggested protocol experimentally.",

    "abstract": "The cell division cycle of the unicellular eukaryote Trypanosome brucei is tightly regulated despite the paucity of transcriptional control that results from the arrangement of genes in polycistronic units and lack of dynamically regulated transcription factors. To identify the contribution of dynamic phosphorylation to T. brucei cell cycle control we have combined cell cycle synchronisation by centrifugal elutriation with quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis. Cell cycle regulated changes in phosphorylation site abundance (917 sites, average 5-fold change) were more widespread and of a larger magnitude than changes in protein abundance (443 proteins, average 2-fold change) and were mostly independent of each other. Hierarchical clustering of co-regulated phosphorylation sites according to their cell cycle profile revealed that a bulk increase in phosphorylation occurs across the cell cycle, with a significant enrichment of known cell cycle regulators and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) within the largest clusters. Cell cycle regulated changes in essential cell cycle kinases are temporally co-ordinated with differential phosphorylation of components of the kinetochore and eukaryotic initiation factors, along with many RBPs not previously linked to the cell cycle such as eight PSP1-C terminal domain containing proteins. The temporal profiles demonstrate the importance of dynamic phosphorylation in co-ordinating progression through the cell cycle, and provide evidence that RBPs play a central role in post-transcriptional regulation of the T. brucei cell cycle.\\n\\nData are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD013488.",

    "abstract": "Rho-kinase (Rok) is a major myosin II activator during morphogenesis. In the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland placode Rok is planar polarised at the tissue boundary, through a negative regulation by the apical polarity protein Crumbs that is anisotropically localised at the boundary. However, in inner cells of the placode both Crumbs and Rok are isotropically enriched at junctions. We propose a model that reconciles both behaviours through modulation of Rok membrane residence time by Crumbs and downstream effectors. Using FRAP in embryos expressing endogenously-tagged Rok combined with in silico simulations, we find that the lower membrane dissociation rate (koff) of Rok at the tissue boundary, where Crumbs membrane levels are lower, explains this boundary-specific effect. The S/T-kinase Pak1 negatively affects Rok membrane association in vivo within the epidermis, and in vitro can phosphorylate Rok near the PH domain that mediates membrane association. Pak1 is recruited to the membrane by Cdc42 which, like its binding partner Crumbs, shows anisotropic localisation at the boundary. These data reveal an important mechanism of modulation of Rok membrane residence time via affecting the koff that may be widely employed during tissue morphogenesis.",

Contact probability should decrease as the spatial distance between two loci increases. However, studies comparing Hi-C and FISH data show that in some cases the distance between one pair of loci, with larger Hi-C readout, is paradoxically larger compared to another pair with a smaller value of the contact probability. Here, we show that the FISH-Hi-C paradox can be resolved using a theory based on a Generalized Rouse Model for Chromosomes (GRMC). The FISH-Hi-C paradox arises because the cell population is highly heterogeneous, which means that a given contact is present in only a fraction of cells. Insights from the GRMC is used to construct a theory, without any adjustable parameters, to extract the distribution of subpopulations from the FISH data, which quantitatively reproduces the Hi-C data. Our results show that heterogeneity is pervasive in genome organization at all length scales, reflecting large cell-to-cell variations.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium verticillioides is one of the key fungal pathogens responsible for maize stalk rots. While stalk rot pathogens are prevalent worldwide, our understanding of stalk rot virulence mechanism in pathogenic fungi is still very limited. We previously identified F. verticillioides FvSYN1 gene, which was demonstrated to plays an important role in maize stalk rot virulence. FvSyn1 belongs to a family of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins that play critical roles in a variety of developmental processes. In this study, we further characterized the cellular features of FvSyn1 protein motifs in F. verticillioides development and virulence. We generated FvSyn1 motif-specific deletion mutants to further investigate how different motifs contribute to development and virulence. Microscopic observation showed that {Delta}fvsyn1 mutant exhibits rough and hyper-branched hyphae when compared to the wild type progenitor. Moreover, {Delta}fvsyn1 mutant was sensitive to cell wall stress agents resulting in vegetative growth reduction. We showed that FvSyn1::GFP protein is associated with endomembrane but this outcome did not clarify why the deletion of this protein led to stress sensitivity and aberrant hyphal development. Characterization of FvSyn1 domains indicated that both Syntaxin N-terminus (SynN) domain and SNARE C-terminus domain play distinct roles in fungal development but collectively function in virulence. We also determined that two domains in FvSyn1 is not required for fumonisin production. Interestingly, these two domains were involved in carbon nutrient utilization including pectin, starch and sorbitol. This study further characterized the role of FvSyn1 in hyphal growth, localization, cell wall stress response and virulence in F. verticillioides.\\n\\nHighlights{blacktriangleright} F. verticillioides SNARE protein FvSYN1 is important for vegetative growth and virulence.\\n\\n {blacktriangleright}FvSYN1 deletion mutant performed better under cell wall stressors.\\n\\n {blacktriangleright}Dissecting of two domains and investigate the roles.",

The underlying mechanisms for this synergy have yet to be elucidated and investigations have largely focused on cellular interactions. Herein, we report a molecular crosstalk in which the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 and the CTLA4 ligand CD80 heterodimerize in cis. This heterodimerization blocks both PD-L1:PD-1 and CD80:CTLA4 interactions, but preserves the ability of CD80 to activate the T cell costimulatory receptor CD28. Remarkably, PD-L1 expression on antigen presenting cells (APCs) protects CD80 from CTLA4 mediated trans-endocytosis, and the therapeutic PD-L1 blockade antibody atezolizumab paradoxically downregulates CD80 on APCs, presumably reducing its co-stimulatory ability. Importantly, this effect can be negated by co-blockade of CTLA4 with ipilimumab. Our study reveals an unexpected immune stimulatory role of cis-acting PD-L1 and a mechanism of anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA4 crosstalk, providing a therapeutic rationale for combination blockade of PD-L1 and CTLA4.",
