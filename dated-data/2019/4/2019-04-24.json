    "abstract": "Long arrays of simple, tandemly repeated DNA sequences (known as satellites) are enriched in centromeres1 and pericentromeric regions2, and contribute to chromosome segregation and other heterochromatin functions3,4. Surprisingly, satellite DNAs are expressed in many multicellular eukaryotes, and their aberrant transcription may contribute to carcinogenesis and cellular toxicity5-7. Satellite transcription and/or RNAs may also promote centromere and heterochromatin activities 8-12. However, we lack direct evidence that satellite DNA transcripts are required for normal cell or organismal functions. Here, we show that satellite RNAs derived from AAGAG tandem repeats are transcribed in many cell types throughout Drosophila melanogaster development, enriched in neuronal tissues and testes, localized within heterochromatic regions, and important for viability. Strikingly, we find that AAGAG transcripts are necessary for male fertility and are specifically required for normal histone-protamine exchange and sperm chromatin organization. Since AAGAG RNA-dependent events happen late in spermatogenesis when the transcripts are not detected, we speculate that AAGAG RNA functions in primary spermatocytes to  prime post-meiosis steps in sperm maturation. In addition to demonstrating specific essential functions for AAGAG RNAs, comparisons between closely related Drosophila species suggest that satellite repeats and their transcription evolve quickly to generate new functions.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, the larval prothoracic gland integrates nutritional status with developmental signals to regulate growth and maturation through the secretion of the steroid hormone ecdysone. While the nutritional signals and cellular pathways that regulate prothoracic gland function are relatively well studied, the transcriptional regulators that orchestrate the activity of this tissue remain largely unknown. Here we show that lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) is essential for prothoracic gland function. Indeed, restoring kdm5 expression only in the prothoracic gland in an otherwise kdm5 mutant animal is sufficient to rescue both the larval developmental delay and the pupal lethality caused by loss of KDM5. Molecularly, our studies show that KDM5 functions by promoting the endoreplication of prothoracic gland cells, a process that increases ploidy and is rate-limiting for the expression of ecdysone biosynthetic genes. This occurs through KDM5-mediated regulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase torso, which in in turn promotes polyploidization and growth through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our studies provide key insights into the biological processes regulated by KDM5 and the molecular mechanisms that govern the transcriptional regulation of animal development.",

Still, our understanding of how the microbiota modulates immune cells dynamics remains limited, particularly in humans where a lack of deliberate manipulations makes inference challenging. Here we study hundreds of hospitalized--and closely monitored--patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation as they recover from chemotherapy and stem cell engraftment. This aggressive treatment causes large shifts in both circulatory immune cell and microbiota populations, allowing the relationships between the two to be studied simultaneously. We analyzed daily changes in white blood cells from 2,235 patients, and 10,680 longitudinal microbiota samples to identify bacteria associated with those changes. Bayesian inference and validation across patient cohorts revealed consistent associations between gut bacteria and white blood cell dynamics in the context of immunomodulatory medications, clinical metadata and homeostatic feedbacks. We contrasted the potency of fermentatively active, obligate anaerobic bacteria with that of medications with known immunomodulatory mechanism to estimate the potential of the microbiota to influence peripheral immune cell dynamics. Our analysis establishes and quantifies the link between the gut microbiota and the human immune system, with implications for microbiota-driven modulation of immunity.",

    "abstract": "Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are associated with lower quality of life, higher risk of seizure-related injuries, increased chance of sudden unexpected death, as well as unfavorable treatment outcomes. Achieving greater understanding of its underlying circuitry offers better opportunity to control these particularly serious seizures. Towards this goal, we provide a network science perspective of the interactive pathways among basal ganglia, thalamus and the cortex, to explore the imprinting of secondary seizure generalization on the mesoscale brain network in temporal lobe epilepsy. Specifically, we parameterized the functional organization of both the thalamocortical network and the basal ganglia--thalamus network with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in three groups of patients with different focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure histories. Using the participation coefficient to describe the pattern of thalamocortical connections among different cortical networks, we showed that, compared to patients with no previous history, those with positive histories of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, including both remote (none for over one year) and current (within the past year) histories, presented more uniform distribution patterns of thalamocortical connections in the ipsilateral medial-dorsal thalamic nuclei. As a sign of greater thalamus mediated cortico-cortical communication, this result comports with greater susceptibility to secondary seizure generalization from the epileptogenic temporal lobe to broader brain networks in these patients. Using interregional integration to characterize the functional interaction between basal ganglia and thalamus, we demonstrated that patients with current history presented increased interaction between putamen and globus pallidus internus, and decreased interaction between the latter and the thalamus, compared to the other two patient groups. Importantly, through a series of \\\"disconnection\\\" simulations, we showed that these changes in interactive profiles of the basal ganglia--thalamus network in the current history group mainly depended upon the direct but not the indirect basal ganglia pathway. It is intuitively plausible that such disruption in the striatum modulated tonic inhibition of the thalamus from the globus pallidus internus could lead to an under-suppressed thalamus, which in turn may account for their greater vulnerability to secondary seizure generalization. Collectively, these findings suggest that the broken balance between the basal ganglia inhibition and thalamus synchronization can inform the presence and effective control of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. The mechanistic underpinnings we uncover may shed light on the development of new treatment strategies for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of organ size control remain poorly understood. A key question is how cells collectively sense the overall status of a tissue. We addressed this problem focusing on mouse liver regeneration, which is controlled by Hippo signalling. Using digital tissue reconstruction and quantitative image analysis, we found that the apical surface of hepatocytes forming the bile canalicular network expands concomitant with an increase of F-actin and phospho-Myosin, to compensate an overload of bile acids. Interestingly, these changes are sensed by the Hippo transcriptional co-activator YAP, which localizes to the apical F-actin-rich region and translocates to the nucleus in dependence of the acto-myosin system. This mechanism tolerates moderate bile acid fluctuations under tissue homeostasis, but activates YAP in response to sustained bile acid overload. Using an integrated biophysical-biochemical model of bile pressure and Hippo signalling, we explained this behaviour by the existence of a mechano-sensory mechanism that activates YAP in a switch-like manner. We propose that the apical surface of hepatocytes acts as a self-regulatory mechano-sensory system that responds to critical levels of bile acids as readout of tissue status.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsThe small intestine (SI) displays regionality in nutrient and immunological function. Following SI tissue loss (as occurs in short gut syndrome, or SGS), remaining SI must compensate, or  adapt; the capacity of SI epithelium to reprogram its regional identity has not been described. Here, we apply single-cell resolution analyses to characterize molecular changes underpinning adaptation to SGS.\\n\\nMethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on epithelial cells isolated from distal SI of mice following 50% proximal small bowel resection (SBR) vs. sham surgery. Single-cell profiles were clustered based on transcriptional similarity, reconstructing differentiation events from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) through to mature enterocytes. An unsupervised computational approach to score cell identity was used to quantify changes in regional (proximal vs distal) SI identity, validated using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, qPCR, western blotting, and RNA-FISH.\\n\\nResultsUniform Manifold Approximation and Projection-based clustering and visualization revealed differentiation trajectories from ISCs to mature enterocytes in sham and SBR. Cell identity scoring demonstrated segregation of enterocytes by regional SI identity: SBR enterocytes assumed more mature proximal identities. This was associated with significant upregulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress gene expression, which was validated via orthogonal analyses. Observed upstream transcriptional changes suggest retinoid metabolism and proximal transcription factor Creb3l3 drive proximalization of cell identity in response to SBR.\\n\\nConclusionsAdaptation to proximal SBR involves regional reprogramming of ileal enterocytes toward a proximal identity. Interventions bolstering the endogenous reprogramming capacity of SI enterocytes--conceivably by engaging the retinoid metabolism pathway--merit further investigation, as they may increase enteral feeding tolerance, and obviate intestinal failure, in SGS.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=83 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/615054v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156d1b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1a3fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d519bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d4e9d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SynopsisHere, single-cell RNA sequencing reveals interactions between the retinoid metabolism pathway and  regional reprogramming of distal small intestinal epithelium to a proximal identity following proximal small bowel resection.

    "abstract": "Embryo-derived Langerhans cells (eLC) are maintained within the sealed epidermis without contribution from circulating cells. When the network is perturbed by transient exposure to ultra-violet light, short-term LC are temporarily reconstituted from an initial wave of monocytes, but thought to be superseded by more permanent repopulation with undefined LC precursors. However, the extent to which this mechanism is relevant to immune-pathological processes that damage LC population integrity is not known. Using a model of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, where allo-reactive T cells directly target eLC, we have asked if and how the original LC network is ultimately restored. We find that donor monocytes, but not dendritic cells, are the precursors of the long-term LC in this context. Destruction of eLC leads to recruitment of a single wave of monocytes which engraft in the epidermis and undergo a sequential pathway of differentiation via transcriptionally distinct EpCAM+ precursors. Monocyte-derived LC acquire the capacity of self-renewal, and turn-over in the epidermis was remarkably similar to that of steady state eLC. However, we have identified a bottleneck in the differentiation and survival of epidermal monocytes, which together with the slow turn-over of mature LC limits repair of the network. Furthermore, replenishment of the LC network leads to constitutive entry of cells into the epidermal compartment. Thus, immune injury triggers functional adaptation of mechanisms used to maintain tissue-resident macrophages at other sites, but this process is highly inefficient in the skin.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIImmune injury leads to recruitment of a single wave of monocytes to replace resident Langerhans cells (LC).\\nC_LIO_LIDC lineage cells cannot become long-term replacement LC.\\nC_LIO_LIThe size of the re-emerging network is controlled by density-dependent division of mature LC.\\nC_LIO_LIImmune injury and inefficient repopulation by monocyte-derived cells lead to a permanently altered LC niche.\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/617514v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (32K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c08563org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@753e0corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13ca3cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@269ffc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

While TP53 mutations have been identified in CHIP, the molecular mechanisms by which mutant p53 promotes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion are largely unknown. We discovered that mutant p53 confers a competitive advantage to HSPCs following transplantation and promotes HSPC expansion after radiation-induced stress. Mechanistically, mutant p53 interacts with EZH2 and enhances its association with the chromatin, thereby increasing the levels of H3K27me3 in genes regulating HSPC self-renewal and differentiation. Further, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 decrease the repopulating potential of p53 mutant HSPCs.

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are considered an important candidate in cell therapy and tissue engineering approaches. The culture of stem cells in a 3D environment is known to better resemble the in vivo situation and to promote therapeutically relevant effects in isolated cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an approach for the isolation of MSCs from adipose tissue into a 3D environment. Furthermore, the use of cryoprotective medium for cryopreservation of whole adipose tissue was evaluated. For the isolation of MSCs, a novel human platelet lysate-based hydrogel was used as matrix and the migration, yield, viability and metabolic activity of cells from the 3D matrix were compared to cells from 2D explant culture. Also, the surface marker profile and differentiation capacity of MSCs from the 3D matrix were evaluated and compared to MSCs from isolation by enzymatic treatment. We found that cryopreservation of whole adipose tissue is feasible, and therefore adipose tissue can be stored and is available for MSC isolation on demand. Also, we demonstrate the isolation of MSCs into the 3D matrix and that cells from this condition display a similar phenotype and differentiation capacity like MSCs derived by traditional isolation procedure. The presented approach allows, for the first time, to isolate MSCs directly into a soft 3D hydrogel environment, avoiding any contact to a 2D plastic culture surface.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn this paper we present a new method for the isolation of mesenchymal stem cells. Usually, these cells grow on two-dimensional plastic surfaces which is far away from their physiologic environment. Our new method allows for the first time the direct outgrowth of cells from primary tissue into a three-dimensional environment, avoiding any contact to a two-dimensional plastic surface. In future, this will allow an entirely three-dimensional in vitro cultivation of stem cells. Using 3D isolated cells will probably also increase the physiologic relevance of in vitro models.",

    "abstract": "Many species are shifting their ranges being forced to rapidly respond to novel stressful environmental conditions. Colonizing individuals experience strong selective forces that favor the expression of life history traits notably affecting dispersal and reproductive rates in newly invaded habitats. Limited information is currently available on trait variation within the invasive range despite being critical for understanding ecological and evolutionary factors that drive the process of range expansion of invasive species. Here we evaluated life history shifts of the widely introduced Asian clam Corbicula, within its invaded range. Through an exhaustive literature search, we obtained data for 17 invasive Corbicula populations from different ecosystems worldwide. We tested the relationship between population and individual parameters relevant to the process of range expansion. Our main results are that recently introduced Corbicula populations were characterized by (i) low density and low rate of population increase, (ii) clams reproduced earlier in slow-growing populations, and (iii) density had no effect on population increase. All Corbicula populations analyzed in this study, which are fixed for one genotype (lineage Form A/R), experienced different selective environments in the introduced range. These findings support the perspective that adaptive phenotypic plasticity favored the expression of traits that maximize fitness in recently established populations, which faced stronger r-selective forces relative to long-established ones. We discuss the role of plasticity in facilitating rapid adaptation and increasing the likelihood of populations to overcome difficulties associated with low densities and low population increase in newly invaded areas.",

Using a mammalian display platform and the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, rationally designed site-directed mutagenesis libraries are introduced by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). Screening and deep sequencing of relatively small libraries (104) produced high quality data capable of training deep neural networks that accurately predict antigen-binding based on antibody sequence. Deep learning is then used to predict millions of antigen binders from an in silico library of ~108 variants, where experimental testing of 30 randomly selected variants showed all 30 retained antigen specificity. The full set of in silico predicted binders is then subjected to multiple developability filters, resulting in thousands of highly-optimized lead candidates. With its scalability and capacity to interrogate high-dimensional protein sequence space, deep learning offers great potential for antibody engineering and optimization.",
