    "abstract": "The electrical membrane potential (Vm) is one of the components of the electrochemical potential of protons across the biological membrane (proton motive force), which powers many vital cellular processes, and Vm also plays a role in signal transduction. Therefore, measuring it is of great interest, and over the years a variety of techniques has been developed for the purpose. In bacteria, given their small size, Nernstian membrane voltage probes are arguably the favourite strategy, and their cytoplasmic accumulation depends on Vm according to the Nernst equation. However, a careful calibration of Nernstian probes that takes into account the trade-offs between the ease with which the signal from the dye is observed, and the dyes interactions with cellular physiology, is rarely performed. Here we use a mathematical model to understand such trade-offs and, based on the knowledge gained, propose a general work-flow for the characterization of Nernstian dye candidates. We demonstrate the work-flow on the Thioflavin T dye in Escherichia coli, and identify conditions in which the dye turns from a Vm probe into an actuator.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\\n\\nThe phospholipid bilayer of a biological membrane is virtually impermeable to charged molecules. Much like in a rechargeable battery, cells harness this property to store an electrical potential that fuels life reactions but also transduces signals. Measuring this electrical potential, also referred to as membrane voltage, is therefore of great interest and a variety of techniques have been employed for the purpose, starting as early as the 1930s. For the case of bacteria, which are smaller in size and possess a stiffer cell wall, arguably the most popular approach to measuring membrane voltage are Nernstian probes that accumulate across the bacterial membrane according to the Nernst potential. The present study characterizes the undesired effects Nernstian probes can have on cell physiology, which can be crucial for the accurate interpretation of experimental results. Using mathematical modelling and experiments, the study provides a general, simple workflow to characterise and minimise these effects.",

Alpha helix 30 is crucial for binding PG during catalysis1. Here we show using an alpha helix 30 deletion strain that LT (LtgA) determines the integrity of the cell wall, participates in cell division and separation, and can be manipulated to impair the fitness of the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis during infection. Characterization of ltgA helix deleted strain interactome identified glycan chain remodeling enzymes whose function appear to be modulated by LTs.

    "abstract": "Cleavage of Notch by the major intramembrane aspartyl protease complex {gamma}-secretase is a central event in cell regulation and is also important to Alzheimers disease, with more than 200 mutations in the catalytic subunit of {gamma}-secretase (PS1) causing severe early-onset forms of the disease. Recently, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revealed the electron density of the protein-Notch complex in frozen solution, indicating major changes upon substrate binding and a possible helix unwinding to expose peptide bonds. In order understand the all-atom dynamics that cause this process, and to test the Notch binding in a membrane protein rather than solution, we developed an all-atom model of mature wild-type {gamma}-secretase bound to Notch in a complete membrane-water system and studied the system using three independent 500-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations. Our ensembles are in essential agreement with known cryo-EM data. As in previous simulations we find unusual {beta}-strand transitions in exposed parts of PS1. We also observe the atomic helix motions that cause loss of helicity in bound Notch by direct comparison to corresponding 500 ns simulations of free Notch, in particular five residues to the N-terminal site of the primary cleavage site. Most importantly, we identify three conformation states, with two of them differing in the Notch-bound catalytic site. These dynamics produce a ping-pong relationship of positioning the S3 cleavage sites of Notch relative to the aspartates. These conformation states are not visible in the cryo-EM data; probably the density is an average snapshot of the two states. Our identified conformation states rationalize how Notch cleavage can be imprecise and yield multiple products. Our identified conformation states may aid efforts to develop conformation-selective drugs that target C99 and Notch cleavage differently.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceThe atomic dynamics underlying cleavage of Notch by {gamma}-secretase in the membrane is of major biological importance. Electron microscopy has revealed the protein-Notch complex in frozen solution, showing major changes upon substrate binding and helix unwinding to expose peptide bonds, but does not explain why substrate cleavage is imprecise and produces several products. Our model of wild-type {gamma}-secretase bound to Notch in a complete membrane-water system equilibrated by 3 x 500 nanoseconds of molecular dynamics strongly complements the electron microscopy data: We identify the specific loop and helix motions that cause the {beta}-strand transitions in PS1 and the loss of helicity in specific residues of bound Notch. We identify different conformations of Notch, which importantly affect the S3 cleavage site; the open state may cause the imprecise cleavage with earlier release of products. Our identified states can aid development of conformation-selective drugs that target C99 and Notch cleavage differently.",

Here we report that lipid raft microdomains are essential components of the phagolysosomal membrane of macrophages. Genetic deletion of the lipidraft chaperons flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 demonstrate that the assembly of both major defense complexes vATPase and NADPH oxidase on the phagolysosomal membrane requires lipid rafts. Furthermore, we discovered a new virulence mechanism leading to the dysregulation of lipid-raft formation by melanized wild-type conidia of the important human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. This results in reduced phagolysosomal acidification. Phagolysosomes with ingested melanized conidia contain a reduced amount of free Ca2+ ions as compared to phagolysosomes with melanin-free conidia. In agreement with a role of Ca2+ for generation of functional lipid rafts, we show that Ca2+-dependent calmodulin activity is required for lipid-raft formation on the phagolysosome. We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in the human FLOT1 gene that results in heightened susceptibility for invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients. Collectively, flotillin-dependent lipid rafts on the phagolysosomal membrane play an essential role in protective antifungal immunity in humans.",

    "abstract": "Visualizing chromatin adjacent to the nuclear envelope (denoted \\\"epichromatin\\\") by in vitro immunostaining with a bivalent nucleosome-binding antibody (termed monoclonal antibody PL2-6) has suggested a distinct and conserved chromatin structure. Moreover, different staining patterns for chromatin complexed with the monovalent \\\"Fab\\\" fragment of PL2-6, compared to the bivalent form, point to distinct binding interactions. To help interpret antibody/chromatin interactions and these differential binding modes, we incorporate coarse-grained PL2-6 antibody modeling into our mesoscale chromatin model and analyze interactions and fiber structures for the antibody/chromatin complexes in open and condensed chromatin, with and without linker histone H1 (LH). Despite minimal and transient interactions at physiological salt, we capture differential binding for monomer and dimer antibody forms to open fibers, with much more intense interactions in the bivalent antibody/chromatin complex. For these open \\\"zigzag\\\" fiber morphologies, differences result from antibody competition for peptide tail contacts with internal chromatin fiber components (nucleosome core and linker DNA). Antibody competition results in dramatic conformational and energetic differences among monovalent, bivalent, and free chromatin systems in the parental linker DNA / tail interactions. These differences in binding modes and changes in internal fiber structure, driven by conformational entropy gains, help interpret the differential staining patterns for the monovalent versus bivalent antibody/chromatin complexes. More generally, such dynamic interactions which depend on the complex internal structure and self-interactions of the chromatin fiber have broader implications to other systems that bind to chromatin, such as linker histones and remodeling proteins.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEUsing mesoscale modeling, we help interpret differential binding modes for antibody/chromatin interactions to elucidate the structural details of \\\"epichromatin\\\" (chromatin adjacent to the nuclear envelope), which had been visualized to produce different staining patterns for monovalent and bivalent forms of the PL2-6 antibody. To our knowledge, this is the first application of such a coarse-grained computational antibody model to probe chromatin structure and mechanisms of antibody/chromatin binding. Our work emphasizes how antibody units compete with native internal chromatin fiber units (histone tails, nucleosome core, and linker DNA) for fiber-stabilizing interactions and thereby drive differential antibody binding for open zigzag chromatin fibers. Such competition, which dynamically alters internal chromatin structure upon binding, could be relevant to other chromatin binding mechanisms such as those involving linker histones or chromatin remodeling proteins.",

    "abstract": "Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are algal light-gated ion channels widely used as optogenetic tools for manipulating neuronal activity. ChRs desensitize under continuous bright-light illumination, resulting in a significant decline of photocurrents. We describe a novel, metagenomically identified family of phylogenetically distinct anion-conducting ChRs (designated MerMAIDs). MerMAIDs almost completely desensitize during continuous illumination due to accumulation of a late non-conducting photointermediate that disrupts the ion permeation pathway. MerMAID desensitization can be fully explained by a single photocycle in which a long-lived desensitized state follows the short-lived conducting state. A conserved cysteine is the critical factor in desensitization, as its mutation results in recovery of large stationary photocurrents. The rapid desensitization of MerMAIDs enables their use as optogenetic silencers for transient suppression of individual action potentials without affecting subsequent spiking during continuous illumination. Our results could facilitate the development of further novel optogenetic tools from metagenomic databases and enhance general understanding of ChR function.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ECRs extraordinary catalytic activity on the level of the protein assembly remain elusive. Here we used a combination of ambient temperature X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) and cryogenic synchrotron experiments to study the structural organization of the ECR from Kitasatospora setae. K. setae ECR is a homo-tetramer that differentiates into a dimer of dimers of open- and closed-form subunits in the catalytically active state. Using molecular dynamics simulations and structure-based mutagenesis, we show that catalysis is synchronized in K. setae ECR across the pair of two dimers.

    "abstract": "Biological membranes carry fixed charges at their surfaces. These arise primarily from phospholipid head groups. In addition, membrane proteins contribute to the surface potential with their charged residues. Membrane lipids are asymmetrically distributed. Because of this asymmetry the net negative charge at the inner leaflet exceeds that at the outer leaflet. Changes in surface potential are predicted to shape the capacitive properties of the membrane (i.e. the ability of the membrane to store electrical charges). Here, we show that it is possible to detect changes in surface potential by an electrophysiological approach: the analysis of cellular currents relies on assuming that the electrical properties of a cell are faithfully described by a three-element circuit - i.e. the minimal equivalent circuit - comprised of two resistors and one capacitor. However, to account for changes in surface potential it is necessary to add a battery to this circuit connected in series with the capacitor. This extended circuit model predicts that the current response to a square-wave voltage pulse harbors information, which allows for separating the changes in surface potential from a true capacitance change. We interrogated our model by investigating changes in capacitance induced by ligand binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) and to the glycine transporters (GlyT1 and GlyT2). The experimental observations were consistent with the predictions of the extended circuit. We conclude that ligand-induced changes in surface potential (reflecting the binding event) and in true membrane capacitance (reflecting the concomitant conformational change) can be detected in real time even in instances where they occur simultaneously.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceThe plasma membrane of a cell possesses fixed charges on both surfaces. Surface charges play an important role in many biological processes. However, the mechanisms, which regulate the surface charge densities at the plasma membrane, are poorly understood. This is in part due to lack of experimental approaches that allow for detecting changes in surface charges in real time. Here, we show that it is possible to track alterations in the electric potential at the membrane surface with high temporal resolution by an electrophysiological approach. Importantly, the described method allows for discriminating between a change in surface potential and a change in true membrane capacitance (e.g. a change in membrane area), even if these occur in parallel.",

Prevailing models for this longstanding mystery of appendage regeneration speculate fin cells maintain uncharacterized positional identities that instruct outgrowth after injury. Using zebrafish, we find differential Wnt production correlates with the extent of regeneration across the caudal fin. We identify Dachshund transcription factors as markers of distal blastema cells that produce Wnt and thereby promote a pro-progenitor and -proliferation environment. We show these Dach-expressing \\\"niche cells\\\" derive from mesenchyme populating cylindrical and progressively tapered fin rays.

Supported by mathematical modeling, we show longfint2 zebrafish regenerate exceptionally long fins due to a perdurant niche, representing a \\\"broken countdown timer\\\". We propose regenerated fin size is dictated by the amount of niche formed upon damage, which simply depends on the availability of intra-ray mesenchyme defined by skeletal girth at the injury site. Likewise, the fin reestablishes a tapered ray skeleton because progenitor osteoblast output reflects diminishing niche size. This \\\"transpositional scaling\\\" model contends mesenchyme-niche state transitions and positional information provided by self-restoring skeletal geometry rather than cell memories determine a regenerated fins size and shape.",

We examined scenarios in which a statins initial RRR (30%) gradually doubles over 10 to 30 years of treatment.\\n\\nResultsInitiating a statin when 10-year CV risk is 5% resulted in a mean of 20.1 years on a statin before age 75 (8 years more than starting when CV risk reaches 10%). If a statins RRR doubles over 20 years, starting when CV risk is 5% would save about 5.1 to 6.1 additional QALYs per 1000 additional treatment years than starting when CV risk is 10%. Most of this additional benefit was accrued by those who reach a 5% risk at a younger age. Due to the prolonged treatment period, however, early treatment could also result in net harm if the treatment slowly increased a major complication of aging, such as muscular or neurological aging.\\n\\nConclusionsIn a thought experiment exploring the impact of delayed effects, we found that if the relative effectiveness of statin therapy gradually doubles over a 10 to 30 year period, starting a statin when 10-year CV risk is 5% could have much more long-term benefit than starting a statin when CV risk is 10%. Most of the additional benefit occurred in those at elevated age-adjusted CV risk.

    "abstract": "In recent years, lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) has emerged as a major threat to cattle outside Africa, where it is endemic. Although evidence suggests that LSDV is transmitted by the bites of blood sucking arthropods, few studies have assessed the risk of transmission posed by particular vector species. Here this risk is assessed by calculating the basic reproduction number (R0) for transmission of LSDV by five species of biting insect: the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans, the biting midge, Culicoides nubeculosus, and three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. Parameters relating to mechanical transmission of LSDV were estimated using new analyses of previously-published data from transmission experiments, while vector life history parameters were derived from the published literature. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were used to compute R0 for each species and to identify those parameters which influence its magnitude. Results suggest that S. calcitrans is likely to be the most efficient at transmitting LSDV, with Ae. aegypti also an efficient vector. By contrast, C. nubeculosus, An. stephensi, and Cx. quinquefasciatus are likely to be inefficient vectors of LSDV. However, there is considerable uncertainty associated with the estimates of R0, reflecting uncertainty in most of the constituent parameters. Sensitivity analysis suggests that future experimental work should focus on estimating the probability of transmission from insect to bovine and on the virus inactivation rate in insects.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the emergence of arboviruses in the temperate city of Cordoba, Argentina (2009-2018), including dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and origins of imported cases. The first cases of dengue fever were reported in 2009, followed by outbreaks in 2013, 2015, and 2016, each outbreak having greater incidence than the previous. DENV1 was the predominant serotype. Cases were imported from Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico, Costa Rica, and northern Argentina. The first imported cases of chikungunya were reported in 2014 and the first imported and autochthonous of Zika fever in 2016. Regional efforts are needed to strengthen surveillance, due to the key role of human movement in arbovirus introductions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn end-stage kidney disease the dialytic cycle relates to the rate of sudden cardiac death. We hypothesized that circadian, dialytic cycles, paroxysmal arrhythmias, and cardiovascular risk factors are associated with periodic changes in heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) in incident dialysis patients.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a prospective ancillary study of the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease cohort (n=28; age 54{+/-}13 y; 57% men; 96% black; 33% with a history of structural heart disease; left ventricular ejection fraction 70{+/-}9%). Continuous ECG monitoring was performed using an ECG patch (Zio Patch, iRhythm) and short-term HRV was measured for three minutes every hour. HRV was measured by root mean square of the successive normal-to-normal intervals (rMSSD), high and low frequency power, Poincare plot, and sample and Renyi entropy.\\n\\nResultsArrhythmias were detected in 46% (n=13). Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) was more frequent during dialysis or within 6 hours post-dialysis, as compared to pre-or between-dialysis (63% vs. 37%, P=0.015), whereas supraventricular tachycardia was more frequent pre-/ between-dialysis, as compared to during-/ post-dialysis (84% vs. 16%, P=0.015). In adjusted for cardiovascular disease and its risk factors autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity panel (ARCH) model, VT events were associated with increased heart rate by 11.2 (95%CI 10.1-12.3) bpm (P<0.0001). During regular dialytic cycle, rMSSD demonstrated significant circadian pattern (Mesor 10.6(0.9-11.2) ms; Amplitude 1.5(1.0-3.1) ms; Peak at 02:01(20:22-03:16) am; P<0.0001), which was abolished on a second day interdialytic extension (adjusted ARCH trend for rMSSD -1.41(-1.67 to -1.15) ms per 24h; P<0.0001).\\n\\nConclusionCardiac arrhythmias associate with dialytic phase. Regular dialytic schedule preserves physiological circadian rhythm, but the second day without dialysis is characterized by parasympathetic withdrawal and a steady increase in sympathetic predominance.\\n\\nSubject TermsArrhythmias, Autonomic Nervous System, Electrocardiology (ECG), Treatment.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an ubiquitous highly prevalent zoonotic protozoan. Cats are the definitive hosts, while all other warm-blooded animals are intermediate hosts for this parasite. Commensal rodents, being the main preys of cats, are probably the major reservoir for T. gondii. Rodents often develop dormant tissue cysts after ingestion of oocysts shed in the environment by cats in the form of contaminated feces. Experimental evidence that vertical transmission can be sufficient to the perpetuation of transmission between generations of mice has also been found. In natural settings, the relative epidemiological importance of vertical transmission over oral transmission is a matter of debate and raises the question of the possibility of a T. gondii cycle in the absence of cats. In the present study, we took advantage of an extensive survey of commensal rodents in Dakar, Senegal, where the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus is the predominant putative reservoir of T. gondii. Host genotype and spatial location through GPS referencing of all trapping localizations were investigated in relation to T. gondii infection in 12 sites of the city of Dakar and on Goree Island. In each sampled site, the occurrence of over-prevalence zones of T. gondii infection was investigated through Kulldorfs statistic using SaTScan software. For the sites where a possible over-prevalence zone was identified, mice family lines were inferred from Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC). In 3 of the 4 identified possible over-prevalence zones, T. gondii infection was not confined to a single family line, which suggested no association between kinship and infection occurrence. This finding rather suggests an environmental source of infection for mice associated with localized putative foci of environmental contamination and supports an oral route of infection for mice from Dakar rather than a cycle based on vertical transmission.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSocio-behavioural factors may contribute to the wide variance in HIV prevalence between and within sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. We studied the associations between socio-behavioural variables potentially related to the risk of acquiring HIV.\n\nMethodsWe used Bayesian network models to study associations between socio-behavioural variables that may be related to HIV. A Bayesian network consists of nodes representing variables, and edges representing the conditional dependencies between variables. We analysed data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 29 SSA countries between 2010 and 2016. We predefined and dichotomized twelve variables, including factors related to age, literacy, HIV knowledge, HIV testing, domestic violence, sexual activity, and womens empowerment. We analysed data on men and women for each country separately and then summarised the results across the countries. We conducted a second analysis including also the individual HIV status in a subset of 23 countries where this information was available. We presented summary graphs showing associations that were present in at least six countries (five in the analysis with HIV status).\n\nResultsWe analysed data from 190,273 men (range across countries 2,295-17,359) and 420,198 women (6,621-38,948). The two variables with the highest total number of edges in the summary graphs were literacy and rural/urban location. Literacy was negatively associated with false beliefs about AIDS and, for women, early sexual initiation, in most countries. Literacy was also positively associated with ever being tested for HIV and the belief that women have the right to ask their husband to use condoms if he has a sexually transmitted infection. Rural location was positively associated with false beliefs about HIV and the belief that beating ones wife is justified, and negatively associated with having been tested for HIV. In the analysis including HIV status, being HIV positive was associated with female-headed household, older age and rural location among women, and with no variables among men.\n\nConclusionsLiteracy and urbanity were strongly associated with several factors that are important for HIV acquisition. Since literacy is one of the few variables that can be improved by interventions, this makes it a promising intervention target.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe population of Tijuana, Mexico is growing rapidly, with a current official population estimate of 1.7 million. Nearly 80,000 people migrate to Tijuana each year, resulting in the rise of neighborhoods with substandard housing, lack of services and inadequate access to health care, including eye care. This study describes refractive errors and the need for corrective lenses among participants attending free clinics in these neighborhoods where they received free eye exams and glasses during January 2016. Methods: This is a retrospective observational chart review of de-identified data collected from intake forms that were filled out for each participant at the clinics. Subjects were self-selected in response to announcements in the neighborhoods where clinics were conducted. Subjects with presenting uncorrected visual acuity 20/30 OU or worse were examined with an autorefractor to measure spherical refractive error. Either prescription or reading glasses were then distributed to participants who had refractive errors. Epi Info, an open source program provided by the CDC, was used to analyze demographic, visual acuity and refractive error data. Results: Presenting visual acuity was evaluated in 1209 people. Of these patients, 70% had a visual acuity of 20/30 or worse. Only 23% of these patients had glasses. Among the patients who were given refractions, 13% had clinically significant myopia (-0.75 D or worse in at least one eye). In participants 20 years old and younger, only 8% had clinically significant myopia. Clinically significant hyperopia (+0.75 D or worse in at least one eye) was detected in 25% of participants. Astigmatism (-1.5 D or worse in at least one eye) was present in 18% of participants. Prescription glasses were given to 542 participants and 396 of these people received their first glasses. Reading glasses were given to 386 people. Among students only 15% presented at the clinics with glasses, while it was determined that 56% of student participants needed glasses. Conclusion: The high levels of uncorrected refractive error in this study suggest limited access to affordable eye care in neighborhoods where clinics were conducted. Prevalence of myopia among adolescents and young adults is increasing in many parts of the world. In contrast, a relatively high prevalence of hyperopia was observed in this age group in Tijuana. The data demonstrate an urgent need for eye care and correction of refractive error in the study group.",

In fact, these Plasmodium species differ in their life cycle and treatment in various factors: development and duration of sexual parasite forms differ, symptoms severity are unequal, relapses present only in P. vivax cases, and the Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is only mandatory in all P. falciparum cases. We compared the spread of drug resistance for both species through two compartmental models using ordinary differential equations. The model structure describes how sensitive and resistant parasite strains infect a human population treated with antimalarials. We found that the early transmission before treatment and the low effectiveness of drug coverage support the prevalence of sensitive parasites delaying the emergence of resistant P. vivax. These results imply that earlier attention of symptomatic and reservoirs of P. vivax accelerates the spread of drug resistance as P. falciparum.",

Limited research exists on the value of such signatures in African American men (AAM), who have poor PCa outcomes. We explored differences in gene expression between EAM and AAM for three commercially available panels recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for PCa prognosis. Materials and Methods: 232 EAM and 95 AAM patients provided radical prostatectomy specimens. Gene expression was quantified using Nanostring for 60 genes spanning the Oncotype DX Prostate, Prolaris, and Decipher panels. A continuous expression-based risk score was approximated for each. Differential expression, intrapanel co-expression and risk by race were assessed.\\n\\nResults and limitationsClinical and pathologic features were similar between AAM and EAM. Differential expression by race was observed for 48% of genes measured, though the magnitudes of expression differences were small. Coexpression patterns were more strongly preserved by race group for Oncotype DX and Decipher versus Prolaris (integrative correlations of 0.87, 0.73, and 0.62, respectively). Poorer prognosis was estimated in EAM versus AAM for Oncotype DX (p < 0.001), whereas no difference in prognosis was predicted between AAM and EAM using Prolaris or Decipher (p > 0.05). Replication of our findings directly on the commercial panels with long-term follow-up is warranted.\\n\\nConclusionsDue to observed racial differences across three commercial gene expression panels for PCa prognosis, caution is warranted when applying these panels in clinical decision-making in AAM.",

We assume that the parameters of the model are known and that when the policy is implemented, all patients receive the same treatment at a given time. We model the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance at the population level with the stochastic version of a compartmental model. The model features two drugs and the possibility of double resistance. Our solution method is a variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. In our example, this method allows to reduce the cumulative infected patient-days over two years by 22% compared to the best standard therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver 180 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer susceptibility have been identified; these SNPs can be combined into polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict breast cancer risk. Since most SNPs were identified in predominantly European populations, little is known about the performance of PRS in non-Europeans. We tested the performance of a 180-SNP PRS in Latinas, a large ethnic group with variable levels of Indigenous American, European, and African ancestry.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a pooled case-control analysis of U.S. Latinas and Latin-American women (4,658 cases, 7,622 controls). We constructed a 180-SNP PRS consisting of SNPs associated with breast cancer risk (p < 5 x 10-8). We evaluated the association between the PRS and breast cancer risk using multivariable logistic regression and assessed discrimination using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We also assessed PRS performance across quartiles of Indigenous American genetic ancestry.\\n\\nResultsOf 180 SNPs tested, 142 showed directionally consistent associations compared with European populations, and 39 were nominally significant (p < 0.05). The PRS was associated with breast cancer risk, with an odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation increment of 1.58 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.64) and AUCROC of 0.63 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.64). The discrimination of the PRS was similar between the top and bottom quartiles of Indigenous American ancestry.\\n\\nConclusionsThe 180-SNP PRS predicts breast cancer risk in Latinas, with similar performance as reported for Europeans. The performance of the PRS did not vary substantially according to Indigenous American ancestry.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccelerometer-driven physical activity guidelines are not available, likely due to the lack of consensus on meaningful and interpretable accelerometer outcomes. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how a data-driven accelerometer metric, the acceleration above which a persons most active minutes are accumulated, can a) quantify the prevalence of meeting current physical activity guidelines for global surveillance and b) moving forward, could inform accelerometer-driven physical activity guidelines. Unlike cut-point methods, the metric is population-independent (e.g. age) and comparable across datasets.\\n\\nMethodsSecondary data analyses were carried out on five datasets using wrist-worn accelerometers: children (N=145), adolescent girls (N=1669), office workers (N=114), pre- (N=1218) and post- (N=1316) menopausal women, and adults with type 2 diabetes (N=475). Open-source software (GGIR) was used to generate the magnitude of acceleration above which a persons most active 60, 30 and 2 minutes are accumulated: M60ACC; M30ACC and M2ACC, respectively.\\n\\nResultsThe proportion of participants with M60ACC (children) and M30ACC (adults) values higher than accelerations indicative of brisk walking (i.e., moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) ranged from 17-68% in children and 15%-81% in adults, tending to decline with age. The proportion of pre-and post-menopausal women with M2ACC values indicative of running and thus meeting recently presented thresholds for bone health ranged from 6-13%.\\n\\nConclusionThese metrics can be used for global surveillance of physical activity, including assessing prevalence of meeting the current physical activity guidelines, across the lifespan. Translation of acceleration magnitudes into indicative activities provides a public health friendly interpretation of results. As accelerometer and corresponding health data accumulate it will be possible to interpret the metrics relative to age- and sex-specific norms and derive evidence-based physical activity guidelines directly from accelerometer data for use in future global surveillance. This is where the key advantages of these metrics lie.",

    "abstract": "The genetic code is tightly linked to epigenetic instructions as to what genes to express, and when and where to express them. The most studied epigenetic mark is DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. Todays technology enables a rapid assessment of DNA sequence and methylation levels at a single-site resolution for hundreds of thousands of sites in the human genome, in thousands of individuals at a time. Recent years have seen a rapid increase in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) searching for the causes of risk for genetic diseases that previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) could not pinpoint. However, those single-omics data analyses led to even more questions and it has become clear that only by integrating data one can get closer to answers. Here, we propose two new methods within genetic association analyses that treat the level of DNA methylation at a given CpG site as environmental exposure. Our analyses search for statistical interactions between a given allele and DNA methylation (GxMe), and between a parent-of-origin effect and DNA methylation (PoOx Me). The new methods were implemented in the R package Haplin and were tested on a dataset comprising genotype data from mother-father-child triadsm with DNA methylation data from the children only. The phenotype here was orofacial clefts (OFC), a relatively common birth defect in humans, which is known to have a genetic origin and an environmental component possibly mediated by DNA methylation. We found no significant PoOxMe interactions and a few significant GxMe interactions. Our results show that the significance of these interaction effects depends on the genomic region in which the CpGs reside and on the number of strata of methylation level. We demonstrate that, by including the methylation level around the SNP in the analyses, the estimated relative risk of OFC can change significantly. We also discuss the importance of including control data in such analyses. The new methods will be of value for all the researchers who want to explore genome- and epigenome-wide datasets in an integrative manner. Moreover, thanks to the implementation in a popular R package, the methods are easily accessible and enable fast scans of the genome- and epigenome-wide datasets.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the safety, health, and overall well-being of animals raised for food is both an ethical obligation and a critical component of providing safe food products. The use of antibiotics for maintaining animal health has come under scrutiny in recent years due to the rise of antibiotic resistance globally. Some U.S. producers, especially in the poultry industry, have responded by eliminating their antibiotic use. The number of animals raised without antibiotics (RWA) is growing in the U.S., but there are concerns that RWA practices might negatively impact animal health and welfare. Therefore, the objective of this study was to survey U.S. veterinarians and producers about their experiences and opinions regarding RWA production. Veterinarians, farmers, ranchers, producers, and other stakeholders involved in raising broilers, turkeys, swine, beef cattle or dairy cattle were surveyed. Of the 565 completed responses received, 442 self-reported as practicing veterinarians or producers. Just over half of respondents reported having past or current experience with RWA programs. The main indicated reasons for raising animals without antibiotics were market driven; switching to RWA production was less commonly made for health-related reasons, such as to reduce antibiotic resistance or to improve animal health and welfare. Although respondents felt that RWA production has negative impacts on animal health and welfare, they overwhelmingly (>70%) indicated that the customer (retailer/restaurant/food service) believes that animal and health welfare will be significantly improved. Veterinarians and producers indicated that RWA programs will increase production costs with questionable effect on meat, egg or dairy consumer demand. Many respondents felt that there are times when the RWA label takes priority over animal health and welfare. Respondents generally felt that there was a need for increased auditing/assessment of animal health and welfare in RWA systems.",

    "abstract": "Although there has been a well-established association between adiposity and hypertension, whether such associations are heterogeneous for South Asian populations or for different socioeconomic groups is not well-known. We analysed the recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from Bangladesh, India, and Nepal to estimate the age-specific prevalence of hypertension and the association of body mass index (BMI) with hypertension. We used multiple logistic regressions to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of hypertension for overweight and obesity as well as for each 5-unit increase in BMI. The overall prevalence for hypertension among participants aged 35-44 years were 17.4%, 20%, and 22.5% for Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, respectively. For all age groups, men were more likely to be hypertensive than women in India and Nepal, but not in Bangladesh. Overweight and obesity were associated with higher odds of hypertension in all countries. For each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI, the ORs for hypertension were 1.79 (95% CI: 1.65-1.93), 1.59 (95% CI: 1.58-1.61), and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.90-2.16) in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, respectively. The associations between BMI and hypertension were consistent across various subgroups defined by sex, age, urbanicity, educational attainment and households wealth index. Our study shows that the association of BMI with hypertension is stronger for South Asian populations, and public health measures to reduce population-level reduction in BMI would also help in lowering the burden of hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Tumor growth is a spatiotemporal birth-and-death process with loss of heterotypic contact-inhibition of locomotion (CIL) of tumor cells promoting invasion and metastasis. Therefore, representing tumor cells as two-dimensional points, we can expect the tumor tissues in histology slides to reflect realizations of spatial birth-and-death process which can be mathematically modeled to reveal molecular mechanisms of CIL, provided the mathematics models the inhibitory interactions. Gibbs process as an inhibitory point process is a natural choice since it is an equilibrium process of the spatial birth-and-death process. That is if the tumor cells maintain homotypic contact inhibition, the spatial distributions of tumor cells will result in Gibbs hard core process over long time scales. In order to verify if this is the case, we applied the Gibbs process to 411 TCGA Glioblastoma multiforme patient images. Our imaging dataset included all cases for which diagnostic slide images were available.\n\nThe model revealed two clusters, one of which - the \"Gibbs cluster,\" showed the convergence of the Gibbs process with significant survival difference. Further smoothing the discretized (and noisy) inhibition metric, for both increasing and randomized survival time, we found a significant association of the patients in the Gibbs cluster with increasing survival time. The mean inhibition metric also revealed the point at which the homotypic CIL establishes in tumor cells. Besides, RNAseq analysis between patients with loss of heterotypic CIL and intact homotypic CIL in the Gibbs cluster unveiled cell movement gene signatures and differences in Actin cytoskeleton and RhoA signaling pathways as key molecular alterations. These genes and pathways have established roles in CIL. Taken together, our integrated analysis of patient images and RNAseq data provides for the first time a mathematical basis for CIL in tumors, explains survival as well as uncovers the underlying molecular landscape for this key tumor invasion and metastatic phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWe sought to enhance the cytometric analysis of MDS by performing a pilot study of a single cell mass cytometry (MCM) assay to more comprehensively analyze patterns of surface marker expression in patients with MDS.\\n\\nExperimental DesignTwenty-three MDS and five healthy donor bone marrow samples were studied using a 34-parameter mass cytometry panel utilizing barcoding and internal reference standards. The resulting data were analyzed by both traditional gating and high-dimensional clustering.\\n\\nResultsThis high-dimensional assay provided three major benefits relative to traditional cytometry approaches: First, MCM enabled detection of aberrant surface maker at high resolution, detecting aberrancies in 27/31 surface markers, encompassing almost every previously reported MDS surface marker aberrancy. Additionally, three previously unrecognized aberrancies in MDS were detected in multiple samples at least one developmental stage: increased CD321 and CD99; and decreased CD47. Second, analysis of the stem and progenitor cell compartment (HSPCs), demonstrated aberrant expression in 21 of the 23 MDS samples, which were not detected in three samples from patients with idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS). These immunophenotypically abnormal HSPCs were also the single most significant distinguishing feature between clinical risk groups. Third, unsupervised clustering of high-parameter MCM data allowed identification of abnormal differentiation patterns associated with immunophenotypically aberrant myeloid cells similar to myeloid derived suppressor cells.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate that high-parameter cytometry methods that enable simultaneous analysis of all bone marrow cell types could enhance the diagnostic utility of immunophenotypic analysis in MDS.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceO_LIHigh-dimensional mass cytometry enables high-resolution characterization of abnormal maker expression and myeloid development in MDS.\\nC_LIO_LIThis technology could enhance MDS diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring and merits further research.\\nC_LI\\n\\nStatement Translational RelevanceIn spite of several studies suggesting the utility of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of myelodysoplastic syndrome (MDS), this technique has not been widely adopted. We sought to enhance the utility of cytometry in MDS by performing the first high-dimensional mass cytometry characterization of a cohort of MDS patients. High-dimensional mass cytometry allowed all bone marrow cell populations to be simultaneously analyzed enabling high-resolution characterization of abnormal maker expression and myeloid development in MDS. This approach could identify almost all previously identified aberrant surface marker expression patterns in MDS while simultaneously enabling analysis by unsupervised clustering. Additionally, this mass cytometry analysis approach enabled the modeling of abnormal differentiation in MDS.
