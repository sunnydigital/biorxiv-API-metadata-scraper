    "abstract": "BackgroundGreen organic solvents such as lactate esters have broad industrial applications and favorable environmental profiles. Thus, manufacturing and use of these biodegradable solvents from renewable feedstocks help benefit the environment. However, to date, the direct microbial biosynthesis of lactate esters from fermentable sugars has not yet been demonstrated.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we present a microbial conversion platform for direct biosynthesis of lactate esters from fermentable sugars. First, we designed a pyruvate-to-lactate ester module, consisting of a lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) to convert pyruvate to lactate, a propionate CoA-transferase (pct) to convert lactate to lactyl-CoA, and an alcohol acyltransferase (AAT) to condense lactyl-CoA and alcohol(s) to make lactate ester(s). By generating a library of five pyruvate-to-lactate ester modules with divergent AATs, we screened for the best module(s) capable of producing a wide range of linear, branched, and aromatic lactate esters with an external alcohol supply. By co-introducing a pyruvate-to-lactate ester module and an alcohol (i.e., ethanol, isobutanol) module into a modular Escherichia coli (chassis) cell, we demonstrated for the first time the microbial biosynthesis of ethyl and isobutyl lactate esters directly from glucose. In an attempt to enhance ethyl lactate production as a proof-of-study, we re-modularized the pathway into 1) the upstream module to generate the ethanol and lactate precursors and 2) the downstream module to generate lactyl-CoA and condense it with ethanol to produce the target ethyl lactate. By manipulating the metabolic fluxes of the upstream and downstream modules through plasmid copy numbers, promoters, ribosome binding sites, and environmental perturbation, we were able to probe and alleviate the metabolic bottlenecks by improving ethyl lactate production by 4.96-fold. We found that AAT is the most rate limiting step in biosynthesis of lactate esters likely due to its low activity and specificity towards the non-natural substrate lactyl-CoA and alcohols.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have successfully established the biosynthesis pathway of lactate esters from fermentable sugars and demonstrated for the first time the direct fermentative production of lactate esters from glucose using an E. coli modular cell. This study defines a cornerstone for the microbial production of lactate esters as green solvents from renewable resources with novel industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species pose a major threat to biodiversity on islands. While successes have been achieved using traditional removal methods, such as toxicants aimed at rodents, these approaches have limitations and various off-target effects on island ecosystems. Gene drive technologies designed to eliminate a population provide an alternative approach, but the potential for drive-bearing individuals to escape from the target release area and impact populations elsewhere is a major concern. Here we propose the \\\"Locally Fixed Alleles\\\" approach as a novel means for localizing elimination by a drive to an island population that exhibits significant genetic isolation from neighboring populations. Our approach is based on the assumption that in small island populations of rodents, genetic drift will lead to multiple genomic alleles becoming fixed. In contrast, multiple alleles are likely to be maintained in larger populations on mainlands. Utilizing the high degree of genetic specificity achievable using homing drives, for example based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, our approach aims at employing one or more locally fixed alleles as the target for a gene drive on a particular island. Using mathematical modeling, we explore the feasibility of this approach and the degree of localization that can be achieved. We show that across a wide range of parameter values, escape of the drive to a neighboring population in which the target allele is not fixed will at most lead to modest transient suppression of the non-target population. While the main focus of this paper is on elimination of a rodent pest from an island, we also discuss the utility of the locally fixed allele approach for the goals of population suppression or population replacement. Our analysis also provides a threshold condition for the ability of a gene drive to invade a partially resistant population.",

    "abstract": "The concept of the alpha female has become widely accepted as a form of female identity in the West. Though relationships between hormone concentrations and alpha-related traits have been demonstrated in alpha nonhuman primates, this has not been examined in the case of the human alpha female. The present study examined the associations of testosterone and cortisol, as well as 3 other hormones, estradiol, oxytocin, and progesterone derived from hair samples, with 11 variables related to the expression of the alpha female identity in a small non-random sample (N=126) of self-identified alpha and non-alpha women in North America. The results revealed statistically significant differences between these groups. When compared to non-alpha women, alpha women scored higher than non-alphas in measures for masculinity, leadership, low introversion, self-esteem, and exhibited lower hair cortisol levels. Alphas exhibited slightly lower estradiol and oxytocin levels than non-alphas though these differences were non-significant. Similar non-significant differences were also found in the case of sexual experience, sexual dominance, testosterone, and progesterone. Though cortisol was not associated with masculine traits, it was positively and significantly associated with leadership. Cortisol was also negatively and significantly associated with strength and a measure for femininity. Progesterone, testosterone, and oxytocin were positively and significantly associated with enjoying sex, as was oxytocin with playing a dominant role in sexual encounters. Surprisingly, testosterone was not associated with alpha status nor with the measure of masculinity, and estradiol was not associated with any of the variables. The results imply that women who identify as alpha may experience less physiological stress than non-alpha females as measured by their lower cortisol levels.",

    "abstract": "The cytoplasmic dynein motor complex transports essential signals and organelles from the cell periphery to perinuclear region, hence is critical for the survival and function of highly polarized cells such as neurons. Dynein Light Chain Roadblock-Type 1 (DYNLRB1) is thought to be an accessory subunit required for specific cargos, but here we show that it is essential for general dynein-mediated transport and sensory neuron survival. Homozygous Dynlrb1 null mice are not viable and die during early embryonic development. Furthermore, heterozygous or adult knockdown animals display reduced neuronal growth, and selective depletion of Dynlrb1 in proprioceptive neurons compromises their survival. Conditional depletion of Dynlrb1 in sensory neurons causes deficits in several signaling pathways, including {beta}-catenin subcellular localization, and a severe impairment in the axonal transport of both lysosomes and retrograde signaling endosomes. Hence, DYNLRB1 is an essential component of the dynein complex.",

    "abstract": "Environmental variation along the geographical space can shape populations by natural selection. In the context of global warming, accompanied by substantial changes in precipitation regimes, it is crucial to understand the role of environmental heterogeneity in tropical trees adaptation, given their disproportional contribution to water and carbon biogeochemical cycles. Here we investigated how heterogeneity in freshwater availability along tropical wetlands has influenced molecular variations of the Black-Mangrove (Avicennia germinans). Fifty-seven trees were sampled in seven sites differing markedly on precipitation regime and riverine freshwater inputs. Using 2,297 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphic markers, we found signatures of natural selection by the genotype association with the precipitation of the warmest quarter and the annual precipitation. We also found candidate loci for selection, based on statistical deviations from neutral expectations of interpopulation differentiation. Most candidate loci present within coding sequences were functionally associated with central aspects of drought-tolerance or plant response to drought. Complementarily, our results suggest the occurrence of rapid evolution of a population, likely in response to sudden and persistent limitation in plant access to soil water, following a road construction in 1974. Observations supporting rapid evolution included reduction in tree size and changes in allele frequencies and in transcripts expression levels associated with increased drought-tolerance, through accumulation of osmoprotectants and antioxidants, biosynthesis of plant cuticle, protection against stress-induced proteins degradation, stomatal closure, photorespiration and photosynthesis. We describe a major role of spatial heterogeneity in freshwater availability in the specialization of this typically tropical tree.",

    "abstract": "Point scanning imaging systems (e.g. scanning electron or laser scanning confocal microscopes) are perhaps the most widely used tools for high resolution cellular and tissue imaging. Like all other imaging modalities, the resolution, speed, sample preservation, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of point scanning systems are difficult to optimize simultaneously. In particular, point scanning systems are uniquely constrained by an inverse relationship between imaging speed and pixel resolution. Here we show these limitations can be mitigated via the use of deep learning-based super-sampling of undersampled images acquired on a point-scanning system, which we termed point-scanning super-resolution (PSSR) imaging. Oversampled, high SNR ground truth images acquired on scanning electron or Airyscan laser scanning confocal microscopes were  crappified to generate semi-synthetic training data for PSSR models that were then used to restore real-world undersampled images. Remarkably, our EM PSSR model could restore undersampled images acquired with different optics, detectors, samples, or sample preparation methods in other labs. PSSR enabled previously unattainable 2 nm resolution images with our serial block face scanning electron microscope system. For fluorescence, we show that undersampled confocal images combined with a multiframe PSSR model trained on Airyscan timelapses facilitates Airyscan-equivalent spatial resolution and SNR with [~]100x lower laser dose and 16x higher frame rates than corresponding high-resolution acquisitions. In conclusion, PSSR facilitates point-scanning image acquisition with otherwise unattainable resolution, speed, and sensitivity.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/740548v8_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (90K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbf19aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b2cc88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@921e1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6c5af_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "High-density markers discovered in large size samples are essential for mapping complex traits at the gene-level resolution for agricultural livestock and crops. However, the unavailability of large reference panels and array designs for a target population of agricultural species limits the improvement of array-based genotype imputation. Recent studies showed very low coverage sequencing (LCS) of a large number of individuals is a cost-effective approach to discover variations in much greater detail in association studies. Here, we performed cohort-wide whole-genome sequencing at an average depth of 0.73x and identified more than 11.3 M SNPs. We also evaluated the data set and performed genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) in 2885 Duroc boars. We compared two different pipelines and selected a proper method (BaseVar/STITCH) for LCS analyses and determined that sequencing of 1000 individuals with 0.2x depth is enough for identifying SNPs with high accuracy in this population. Of the seven association signals derived from the genome-wide association analysis of the LCS variants, which were associated with four economic traits, we found two QTLs with narrow intervals were possibly responsible for the teat number and back fat thickness traits and identified 7 missense variants in a single sequencing step. This strategy (BaseVar/STITCH) is generally applicable to any populations and any species which have no suitable reference panels. These findings show that the LCS strategy is a proper approach for the construction of new genetic resources to facilitate genome-wide association studies, fine mapping of QTLs, and genomic selection, and implicate that it can be widely used for agricultural animal breeding in the future.",

    "abstract": "SummaryB- and T-cell receptor repertoires of the adaptive immune system have become a key target for diagnostics and therapeutics research. Consequently, there is a rapidly growing number of bioinformatics tools for immune repertoire analysis. Benchmarking of such tools is crucial for ensuring reproducible and generalizable computational analyses. Currently, however, it remains challenging to create standardized ground truth immune receptor repertoires for immunoinformatics tool benchmarking. Therefore, we developed immuneSIM, an R package that allows the simulation of native-like and aberrant synthetic full length variable region immune receptor sequences. ImmuneSIM enables the tuning of the immune receptor features: (i) species and chain type (BCR, TCR, single, paired), (ii) germline gene usage, (iii) occurrence of insertions and deletions, (iv) clonal abundance, (v) somatic hypermutation, and (vi) sequence motifs. Each simulated sequence is annotated by the complete set of simulation events that contributed to its in silico generation. immuneSIM permits the benchmarking of key computational tools for immune receptor analysis such as germline gene annotation, diversity and overlap estimation, sequence similarity, network architecture, clustering analysis, and machine learning methods for motif detection.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe package is available via https://github.com/GreiffLab/immuneSIM and will also be available at CRAN (submitted).

    "abstract": "Numerous proteins are sumoylated in normally growing yeast and SUMO conjugation levels rise upon exposure to several stress conditions. We observe high levels of sumoylation also during early exponential growth and when nutrient-rich medium is used. However, we find that reduced sumoylation (~75% less than normal) is remarkably well-tolerated, with no apparent growth defects under non-stress conditions or under osmotic, oxidative, or ethanol stresses. In contrast, strains with reduced activity of Ubc9, the sole SUMO conjugase, are temperature-sensitive, implicating sumoylation in the heat stress response, specifically. Aligned with this, a mild heat shock triggers increased sumoylation which requires functional levels of Ubc9, but likely also depends on decreased desumoylation, since heat shock reduces protein levels of Ulp1, the major SUMO protease. Furthermore, we find that a ubc9 mutant strain with only ~5% of normal sumoylation levels shows a modest growth defect, has abnormal genomic distribution of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and displays a greatly expanded redistribution of RNAPII after heat shock. Together, our data implies that SUMO conjugations are largely dispensable under normal conditions, but a threshold level of Ubc9 activity is needed to maintain transcriptional control and to modulate the redistribution of RNAPII and promote survival when temperatures rise.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease characterized by pancreatic islet dysfunction, insulin resistance, and disruption of blood glucose levels. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >400 independent signals that encode genetic predisposition. More than 90% of the associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localize to non-coding regions and are enriched in chromatin-defined islet enhancer elements, indicating a strong transcriptional regulatory component to disease susceptibility. Pancreatic islets are a mixture of cell types that express distinct hormonal programs, and so each cell type may contribute differentially to the underlying regulatory processes that modulate T2D-associated transcriptional circuits. Existing chromatin profiling methods such as ATAC-seq and DNase-seq, applied to islets in bulk, produce aggregate profiles that mask important cellular and regulatory heterogeneity.\\n\\nMethodsWe present genome-wide single cell chromatin accessibility profiles in >1,600 cells derived from a human pancreatic islet sample using single-cell-combinatorial-indexing ATAC-seq (sci-ATAC-seq). We also developed a deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture to accurately predict open chromatin peak calls in rare cell populations.\\n\\nResultsWe show that sci-ATAC-seq profiles allow us to deconvolve alpha, beta, and delta cell populations and identify cell-type-specific regulatory signatures underlying T2D. Particularly, we find that T2D GWAS SNPs are significantly enriched in beta cell-specific and cross cell-type shared islet open chromatin, but not in alpha or delta cell-specific open chromatin. We also demonstrate, using less abundant delta cells, that deep-learning models can improve signal recovery and feature reconstruction of rarer cell populations. Finally, we use co-accessibility measures to nominate the cell-specific target genes at 104 non-coding T2D GWAS signals.\\n\\nConclusionsCollectively, we identify the islet cell type of action across genetic signals of T2D predisposition and provide higher-resolution mechanistic insights into genetically encoded risk pathways.",

We wanted to verify whether network analysis on EEG sensor level can reveal the corpus callosum pathology in schizophrenia.\\n\\nMethodsWe measured 62-channel EEG on 46 schizophrenia patients and 43 healthy controls during eyes-closed and eyes-open resting-state, mismatch negativity and visual and auditory oddball. We assessed connectivity through correlation, coherence and directed transfer function (DTF) in the delta, theta, alpha, low- and high beta bands.\\n\\nResultsThe coherence and the DTF picked up a consistent pattern of reduced interhemispheric and enhanced intrahemispheric connectivity strength in schizophrenia in the alpha and beta band. This disturbance pattern appeared across all paradigms in the parietal and the occipital region and was generally more pronounced in the right hemisphere.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first study to use multiple similarity measures and different tasks to confirm disturbed brain connectivity on EEG sensor level. We hypothesise that the interhemispheric reductions reflect transcallosal disconnection, while the intrahemispheric increases indicate the inability to suppress the response to stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The identification of biomarkers or predictive features that are indicative of a specific biological or disease state is a major research topic in biomedical applications. Several feature selection(FS) methods ranging from simple univariate methods to recent deep-learning methods have been proposed to select a minimal set of the most predictive features. However, there still lacks the answer to the question of \"which method to use when\". In this paper, we study the performance of feature selection methods with respect to the underlying datasets statistics and their data complexity measures. We perform a comparative study of 11 feature selection methods over 27 publicly available datasets evaluated over a range of number of selected features using classification as the downstream task. We take the first step towards understanding the FS methods performance from the viewpoint of data complexity. Specifically, we (empirically) show that as regard to classification, the performance of all studied feature selection methods is highly correlated with the error rate of a nearest neighbor based classifier. We also argue about the non-suitability of studied complexity measures to determine the optimal number of relevant features. While looking closely at several other aspects, we also provide recommendations for choosing a particular FS method for a given dataset.",

    "abstract": "Schistosoma Mansoni represents an important tropical disease that can cause schistosomiasis mostly in Africa and Middle East with high mortality rates. Moreover, no vaccine against it exists. This study predicts an effective epitope-based vaccine against Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate Aldolase (FBA) enzyme of Schistosoma Mansoni using immunoinformatics approaches. FBA is important for production of energy required for different schistosome activities and survival. The sequences were retrieved from NCBI and several prediction tests were conducted to analyze possible epitopes for B-cell, T-cell MHC class I and II. Tertiary structure of the most promising epitopes was obtained. Two epitopes showed high binding affinity for B-cells, while four epitopes showed high binding affinity for MHCI and MHCII. The results were promising to formulate a vaccine with more than 99.5% population coverage. We hope that these promising epitopes serves as a preventive measure for the disease in the future and recommend invivo and invitro studies.",

    "abstract": "Every year for three years (2016 to 2018), I tried to identify every single person hired as a tenure track prof in ecology or an allied field (e.g., fish & wildlife) in N. America. I identified a total of 566 hires. I used public sources to compile various data on the new hires and the institutions that hired them (e.g., number of publications, teaching experience, hiring institution Carnegie class). I also compiled data provided by anonymous ecology faculty job seekers on ecoevojobs.net (e.g., number of positions applied for, number of publications, numbers of interviews and offers). And I polled readers of the Dynamic Ecology blog to get information about applicant and search committee behavior (e.g., regarding customization of applications to the hiring institution). These data address some widespread anxieties and misunderstandings about the ecology faculty job market, and also speak to gender diversity and equity in recent ecology faculty hiring. They complement, and in some cases improve on, other sources of information, such as anecdotal personal experiences.",

    "abstract": "The link between spatio-temporal resource patterns and movement behaviour is a key ecological process, however, limited experimental support has been produced at the home range scale. In this study, we analysed the spatial responses of a resident large herbivore (roe deer Capreolus capreolus) during an in situ manipulation of a concentrated food resource. Specifically, we experimentally altered feeding site accessibility to roe deer and recorded (for 25 animal-years) individual responses by GPS tracking. We found that, following the loss of their preferred resource, roe deer actively tracked resource dynamics leading to more exploratory movements, and larger, spatially-shifted home ranges. Then, we showed, for the first time experimentally, the importance of site fidelity in the maintenance of large mammal home ranges by demonstrating the return of individuals to their familiar, preferred resource despite the presence of alternate, equally-valuable food resources. This behaviour was modulated at the individual level, where roe deer characterised by a high preference for feeding sites exhibited more pronounced behavioural adjustments during the manipulation. Together, our results establish the connections between movement, space-use, individual preference, and the spatio-temporal pattern of resources in home ranging behaviour.",
