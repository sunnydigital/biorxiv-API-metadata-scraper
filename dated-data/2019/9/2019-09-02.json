    "abstract": "AbstractThe average power of rhythmic neural responses as captured by MEG/EEG/LFP recordings is a prevalent index of human brain function. Increasing evidence questions the utility of trial-/group averaged power estimates however, as seemingly sustained activity patterns may be brought about by time-varying transient signals in each single trial. Hence, it is crucial to accurately describe the duration and power of rhythmic and arrhythmic neural responses on the single trial-level. However, it is less clear how well this can be achieved in empirical MEG/EEG/LFP recordings. Here, we extend an existing rhythm detection algorithm (extended Better OSCillation detection: \"eBOSC\"; cf. Whitten et al., 2011) to systematically investigate boundary conditions for estimating neural rhythms at the single-trial level. Using simulations as well as resting and task-based EEG recordings from a micro-longitudinal assessment, we show that alpha rhythms can be successfully captured in single trials with high specificity, but that the quality of single-trial estimates varies greatly between subjects. Despite those signal-to-noise-based limitations, we highlight the utility and potential of rhythm detection with multiple proof-of-concept examples, and discuss implications for single-trial analyses of neural rhythms in electrophysiological recordings. Using an applied example of working memory retention, rhythm detection indicated load-related increases in the duration of frontal theta and posterior alpha rhythms, in addition to a frequency decrease of frontal theta rhythms that was observed exclusively through amplification of rhythmic amplitudes.\n\nHighlightsO_LITraditional narrow-band rhythm metrics conflate the power and duration of rhythmic and arrhythmic periods. We extend a state-of-the-art rhythm detection method (eBOSC) to derive rhythmic episodes in single trials that can disambiguate rhythmic and arrhythmic periods.\nC_LIO_LISimulations indicate that this can be done with high specificity given sufficient rhythmic power, but with strongly impaired sensitivity when rhythmic SNR is low. Empirically, surface EEG recordings exhibit stable inter-individual differences in -rhythmicity in ranges where simulations suggest a gradual bias, leading to high collinearity between narrow-band and rhythm-specific estimates.\nC_LIO_LIBeyond these limitations, we highlight multiple empirical benefits of characterizing rhythmic episodes in single trials, such as (a) a principled separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic content, (b) an amplification of rhythmic amplitudes, and (c) a specific characterization of sustained and transient events.\nC_LIO_LIIn an exemplary application, rhythm-specific estimates increase sensitivity to working memory load effects, in addition to indicating a frequency modulation of frontal theta rhythms through the amplification of rhythmic power.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe use of DNA data is ubiquitous across animal sciences. DNA may be obtained from an organism for a myriad of reasons including identification and distinction between cryptic species, sex identification, comparisons of different morphocryptic genotypes or assessments of relatedness between organisms prior to a behavioural study. DNA should be obtained while minimizing the impact on the fitness, behaviour or welfare of the subject being tested, as this can bias experimental results and cause long-lasting effects on wild animals. Furthermore, minimizing impact on experimental animals is a key Refinement principle within the  3Rs framework which aims to ensure that animal welfare during experimentation is optimised. The term  non-invasive DNA sampling has been defined to indicate collection methods that do not require capture or cause disturbance to the animal, including any effects on behaviour or fitness. In practice this is not always the case, as the term  non-invasive is commonly used in the literature to describe studies where animals are restrained or subjected to aversive procedures. We reviewed the non-invasive DNA sampling literature for the past six years (380 papers published in 2013-2018) and uncovered the existence of a significant gap between the current use of this terminology (i.e.  non-invasive DNA sampling) and its original definition. We show that 58% of the reviewed papers did not comply with the original definition. We discuss the main experimental and ethical issues surrounding the potential confusion or misuse of the phrase  non-invasive DNA sampling in the current literature and provide potential solutions. In addition, we introduce the terms  non-disruptive and  minimally disruptive DNA sampling, to indicate methods that eliminate or minimise impacts not on the physical integrity/structure of the animal, but on its behaviour, fitness and welfare, which in the literature reviewed corresponds to the situation for which an accurate term is clearly missing. Furthermore, we outline when these methods are appropriate to use.",

    "abstract": "Although metacommunity ecology has been a major field of research in the last decades, with both conceptual and empirical outputs, the analysis of the temporal dynamics of metacommunities has only emerged recently and consists mostly of repeated static analyses. Here, we propose a novel analytical framework to assess metacommunity processes using path analyses of spatial and temporal diversity turnovers. We detail the principles and practical aspects of this framework and apply it to simulated datasets to illustrate its ability to decipher the respective contributions of entangled drivers of metacommunity dynamics. We then apply it to four empirical datasets. Empirical results support the view that metacommunity dynamics may be generally shaped by multiple ecological processes acting in concert, with environmental filtering being variable across both space and time. These results reinforce our call to go beyond static analyses of metacommunities that are blind to the temporal part of environmental variability.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial diversity associated with corals has been studied extensively, however, localization of bacterial associations within the holobiont is still poorly resolved. Here we provide novel insight into the localization of coral-associated microbial aggregates (CAMAs) within tissues of the coral Acropora hyacinthus. In total, 318 and 308 CAMAs were characterized via histological and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches respectively, and shown to be distributed extensively throughout coral tissues collected from five sites in Japan and Australia. The densities of CAMAs within the tissues were negatively correlated with the distance from the coastline (i.e. lowest densities at offshore sites). CAMAs were randomly distributed across the six coral tissue regions investigated. Within each CAMA, bacterial cells had similar morphological characteristics, but bacterial morphologies varied among CAMAs, with at least five distinct types identified. Identifying the location of microorganisms associated with the coral host is a prerequisite for understanding their contributions to fitness. Localization of tissue-specific communities housed within CAMAs is particularly important, as these communities are potentially important contributors to vital metabolic functions of the holobiont.",

    "abstract": "Host phagocytes respond to infections by innate defense mechanisms through metabolic shuffling in order to restrict the invading pathogen. However, this very plasticity of the host provides an ideal platform for pathogen mediated manipulation. By employing the macrophage model of Mtb infection, we identify an important strategy employed by modern clinical lineages in regulating the host immune-metabolism axis. The potent ability of these strains to specifically elicit a strong and early macrophage type I IFN response (in contrast to the protracted response to ancient Mtb), was dependent on an increased ability to localize in acidified phagosomes; this higher transit via acidified compartments is important for stimulation of the DNA dependent signaling in infected macrophages. The augmented IFN signaling provided a positive regulatory loop for enhanced expression of the cellular oxysterol-CH25H which in turn facilitated higher levels of IL6 in macrophages infected with the modern Mtb strains. Requirement of type I IFN signaling in mycobacterial intracellular growth highlights another unique ability of Mtb to manipulate host cell physiology and proinflammatory responses.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCo-evolution with humans has enabled the development of novel adaptive mechanisms for survival in host specific environments in the human TB pathogen-Mtb. We present one such mechanism of modern Mtb strains harnessing the type I IFN immune axis to regulate the host pro-inflammatory response. Our results highlight the use of host intracellular endosomal transit as a mechanism by these strains to ensure a strong type I IFN response in macrophages. We also demonstrate the ability of Mtb to regulate macrophage cholesterol metabolism in order to fine tune the host innate responses. These findings lay the foundation of the future development of a host axis directed intervention strategy against this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported that the p28 auxiliary replication protein encoded by turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is also responsible for eliciting superinfection exclusion (SIE) against superinfecting TCV. However, it remains unresolved whether the replication function of p28 could be separated from its ability to elicit SIE. Here we report the identification of two single amino acid (aa) mutations that decouple these two functions. Using an Agrobacterium infiltration-based delivery system, we transiently expressed a series of p28 deletion and point mutants, and tested their ability to elicit SIE against a co-introduced TCV replicon. We found that substituting alanine (A) for valine (V) and phenylalanine (F) at p28 positions 181 and 182, respectively, modestly compromised SIE in transiently expressed p28 derivatives. Upon incorporation into TCV replicons, V181A and F182A decoupled TCV replication and SIE diametrically. While V181A impaired SIE without detectably compromising replication, F182A abolished TCV replication but had no effect on SIE once the replication of the defective replicon was restored through complementation. Both mutations diminished accumulation of p28 protein, suggesting that p28 must reach a concentration threshold in order to elicit a strong SIE. Importantly, the severe reduction of F182A protein levels correlated with a dramatic loss in the number of intracellular p28 foci formed by p28-p28 interactions. Together these findings not only decouples the replication and SIE functions of p28, but also unveils a concentration dependence for p28 coalescence and SIE elicitation. These data further highlight the role of p28 multimerization in driving the exclusion of secondary TCV infections.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESuperinfection exclusion (SIE) insulates virus-infected cells from subsequent invasion by the same or closely related viruses. SIE has been observed in both animal and plant virus-infected cells. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how SIE is achieved at the molecular level is expected to inspire novel strategies for combating virus infections in humans, animals, and plants. Our group has been using turnip crinkle virus (TCV) to elucidate the molecular interactions critical for SIE elicitation. The current study builds on the previous observation that TCV SIE is elicited by one single TCV-encoded protein (p28), and further identifies key regions and amino acids that are needed for SIE. We unravel key amino acid changes that decouple the replication and SIE functions of p28, and provides novel mechanistic insights of SIE.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplast transcription requires numerous quality control steps to generate the complex but selective mixture of accumulating RNAs. To gain insight into how this RNA diversity is achieved and regulated, we systematically mapped transcript ends by developing a protocol called Terminome-Seq. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model, we catalogued >215 primary 5 ends corresponding to transcription start sites (TSS), as well as 1,628 processed 5 ends and 1,299 3 ends. While most termini were found in intergenic regions, numerous abundant termini were also found within coding regions and introns, including several major TSS at unexpected locations. A consistent feature was the clustering of both 5 and 3 ends, contrasting with the prevailing description of discrete 5 termini, suggesting an imprecision of the transcription and/or RNA processing machinery. Numerous termini correlated with the extremities of small RNA footprints or predicted stem-loop structures, in agreement with the model of passive RNA protection. Terminome-Seq was also implemented for pnp1-1, a mutant lacking the processing enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase. Nearly 2,000 termini were altered in pnp1-1, revealing a dominant role in shaping the transcriptome. In summary, Terminome-Seq permits precise delineation of the roles and regulation of the many factors involved in organellar transcriptome quality control.",

    "abstract": "Freezing behavior is commonly used as a measure of associative fear memory. It can be measured by a trained observer, but this task is time-consuming and subject to variation. Commercially available software packages can also be used to quantify freezing; however, they can be expensive and usually require various parameters to be adjusted by the researcher, leading to additional work and variability in results. With this in mind, we developed Phobos, a freely available, self-calibrating software that measures freezing in a set of videos using a brief manual quantification performed by the user to automatically adjust parameters. To optimize the software, we used four different video sets with different features in order to determine the most relevant parameters, the amount of videos needed for calibration and the minimum criteria to consider it reliable. The results of four different users were compared in order to test intra- and interobserver variability in manual and automated freezing scores. Our results suggest that Phobos can be an inexpensive, simple and reliable tool for measurement of fear-related behavior, with intra- and interuser variability similar to that obtained with manual scoring.",

    "abstract": "We addressed the onset of synergistic activity of the two well-studied antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 (MG2a) and PGLa using lipid-only mimics of Gram-negative cytoplasmic membranes. Specifically, we coupled a joint analysis of small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering experiments on fully hydrated lipid vesicles in the presence of MG2a and L18W-PGLa to all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. In agreement with previous studies both peptides, as well as their equimolar mixture, were found to remain in a surface-aligned topology upon membrane insertion and to induce significant membrane perturbation as evidenced by membrane thinning and hydrocarbon order parameter changes in the vicinity of the inserted peptide. These effects were particularly pronounced for the so called synergistic mixture of 1:1 (mol/mol) L18W-PGLa/MG2a and cannot be accounted for by a linear combination of the membrane perturbations of two peptides individually. Our data are consistent with parallel heterodimers forming at much lower concentrations than previously considered, but which do not induce a synergistic leakage of dyes. Our simulations further show that the heterodimers interact via salt bridges and hydrophobic forces, which apparently makes them more stable than putatively formed antiparallel L18W-PGLa and MG2a homodimers. Moreover, dimerization of L18W-PGLa and MG2a leads to a relocation of the peptides within the lipid headgroup regime as compared to the individual peptides. The early onset of dimerization of L18W-PGLa and MG2a at low peptide concentrations consequently appears to be key to their synergistic dye-releasing activity from lipid vesicles at high concentrations.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe demonstrate that specific interactions of the antimicrobial peptides MG2a and PGLa with each other in POPE/POPG bilayers lead to the formation of surface-aligned parallel dimers, which provide already at low peptide concentrations the nucleus for the peptides well-known synergistic activity.",

    "abstract": "Sleep-active neurons depolarize during sleep to suppress wakefulness circuits. Wake-active wake-promoting neurons in turn shut down sleep-active neurons, thus forming a bipartite flip-flop switch. However, how sleep is switched on is unclear because it is not known how wakefulness is translated into sleep-active neuron depolarization when the system is set to sleep. Using optogenetics in C. elegans, we solved the presynaptic circuit for depolarization of the sleep-active RIS neuron during developmentally-regulated sleep, also known as lethargus. Surprisingly, we found that RIS activation requires neurons that have known roles in wakefulness and locomotion behavior. The RIM interneurons, which are active during and can induce reverse locomotion, play a complex role and can act as inhibitors of RIS when they are strongly depolarized and as activators of RIS when they are modestly depolarized. The PVC command interneurons, which are known to promote forward locomotion during wakefulness, act as major activators of RIS. The properties of these locomotion neurons are modulated during lethargus. The RIMs become less excitable. The PVCs become resistant to inhibition and have an increased capacity to activate RIS. Separate activation of neither the PVCs nor the RIMs appears to be sufficient for sleep induction; instead, our data suggests that they act in concert to activate RIS. Forward and reverse circuit activity is normally mutually exclusive. Our data suggest that RIS may be activated at the transition between forward and reverse locomotion states, perhaps when both reverse (including RIM) and forward (PVC) circuit activity overlaps. While RIS is not strongly activated outside of lethargus, altered activity of the locomotion interneurons during lethargus favors strong RIS activation and thus sleep. The control of sleep-active neurons by locomotion circuits suggests that sleep may have evolved from locomotion quiescence. The flip-flop sleep switch in C. elegans thus requires an additional component, wake-active sleep-promoting neurons that translate wakefulness into the depolarization of a sleep-active neuron when the worm is sleepy. Wake-active sleep-promoting circuits may also be required for sleep state switching in other animals including in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Life expectancy and obesity rates have drastically increased in recent years. An unhealthy weight is related to long-lasting biological deregulations that might compromise the normal course of aging. The aim of the current study was to test whether the network composition of young adults with obesity would show signs of premature aging. To this end, subjects with obesity (N = 30, mean age 32.8 {+/-} 5.68), healthy-weight controls (N = 33, mean age 30.9 {+/-} 6.24) as well as non-demented seniors (N = 30, mean age 67.1 {+/-} 6.65) all underwent a resting-state MRI acquisition. Functional connectivity was studied by means of graph-theory measurements (i.e., small-world index, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and mean degree). Contrary to what expected, obesity in adults was related to disruptions in small-world properties driven by increases in network segregation (i.e., clustering coefficient) as compared to elders. Also, this group showed alterations in global and regional centrality metrics (i.e., degree) relative to controls and seniors. Despite not mimicking what was here shown by seniors, the topological organization linked to an obesity status may represent a flaw for cognitive functions depending on the rapid combination between different modular communities.",

In this study, we present O_SCPLOWSCC_SCPLOWPPIN, a method for integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data with protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) that detects active modules in cells of different transcriptional states. We achieve this by clustering RNA-sequencing data, identifying differentially expressed genes, constructing node-weighted PPINs, and finding the maximum-weight connected subgraphs with an exact Steiner-tree approach. As a case study, we investigate RNA-sequencing data from human liver spheroids but the techniques described here are applicable to other organisms and tissues. O_SCPLOWSCC_SCPLOWPPIN allows us to expand the output of differential expressed genes analysis with information from protein interactions. We find that different transcriptional states have different subnetworks of the PPIN significantly enriched which represent biological pathways. In these pathways, O_SCPLOWSCC_SCPLOWPPIN also identifies proteins that are not differentially expressed but have a crucial biological function (e.g., as receptors) and therefore reveals biology beyond a standard differentially expressed gene analysis.",

    "abstract": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is known to regulate cortical activity during different behavioral states, e.g. wakefulness and attention. Here we show a differential expression of muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) and nicotinic AChRs (nAChRs) in different layer 6A (L6A) pyramidal cell (PC) types of somatosensory cortex. At low concentrations, ACh induced a persistent hyperpolarization in corticocortical (CC) but a depolarization in corticothalamic (CT) L6A PCs via M4 and M1 mAChRs, respectively. At [~]1 mM ACh depolarized exclusively CT PCs via 4{beta}2 subunit-containing nAChRs without affecting CC PCs. Miniature EPSC frequency in CC PCs was decreased by ACh but increased in CT PCs. In synaptic connections with a presynaptic CC PC, glutamate release was suppressed via M4 mAChR activation but enhanced by nAChRs via 4{beta}2 nAChRs when the presynaptic neuron was a CT PC. Thus, in layer 6A the interaction of mAChRs and nAChRs results in an altered excitability and synaptic release, effectively strengthening corticothalamic output while weakening corticocortical synaptic signaling.",

    "abstract": "Neural development is not just a linear expansion of the brain. Instead, the structure and function of developing brain circuits undergo drastic alterations that have a direct impact on the animals expanding behavioural repertoire. Here we investigated the developmental changes in the habenula, a brain region that mediates behavioural flexibility during learning, social interactions and aversive experiences. We showed that developing habenular circuits exhibit multiple alterations, which increase the structural and functional diversity of cell types, inputs and functional modules within habenula. As the neural architecture of habenula develops, it sequentially transforms into a multi-sensory brain region that can process visual and olfactory information. Moreover, we also observed that already at early developmental stages, the habenula exhibits spatio-temporally structured spontaneous neural activity that shows prominent alterations and refinement with age. Interestingly, these alterations in spontaneous activity are accompanied by sequential neurogenesis and integration of distinct neural clusters across development. Finally, by combining an in vivo neuronal birthdating method with functional imaging, we revealed that clusters of habenular neurons with distinct functional properties are born sequentially at distinct developmental time windows. Our results highlight a strong link between the function of habenular neurons and their precise birthdate during development, which supports the idea that sequential neurogenesis leads to an expansion of neural clusters that correspond to distinct functional modules in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Every cell must produce enough membrane to contain itself. However, the mechanisms by which the rate of membrane synthesis is coupled with the rate of cell growth remain unresolved. By comparing substrate and enzyme concentrations of the fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis pathways of Escherichia coli across a 3-fold range of carbon-limited growth rates, we show that the rate of membrane phospholipid synthesis during steady-state growth is determined principally through allosteric control of a single enzyme, PlsB. Due to feedback regulation of the fatty acid pathway, PlsB activity also indirectly controls synthesis of lipopolysaccharide, a major component of the outer membrane synthesized from a fatty acid synthesis intermediate. Surprisingly, concentrations of the enzyme that catalyses the committed step of lipopolysaccharide synthesis (LpxC) do not vary across steady-state growth conditions, suggesting that steady-state lipopolysaccharide synthesis is modulated primarily via indirect control by PlsB. In contrast to steady-state regulation, we find that responses to environmental perturbations are triggered directly via changes in acetyl-CoA concentrations, which enables rapid adaptation. Adaptations are further modulated by ppGpp, which regulates PlsB activity during slow growth and growth arrest. The strong reliance of the membrane synthesis pathway upon post-translational regulation ensures both reliability and responsiveness of membrane synthesis.\n\nSignificanceHow do bacteria cells grow without breaking their membranes? Although the biochemistry of fatty acid and membrane synthesis is well-known, how membrane synthesis is balanced with growth and metabolism has remained unclear. This is partly due to the many control points that have been discovered within the membrane synthesis pathways. By precisely establishing the contributions of individual pathway enzymes, our results simplify the model of membrane biogenesis in the model bacteria species Escherichia coli. Specifically, we find that allosteric control of a single enzyme, PlsB, is sufficient to balance growth with membrane synthesis and to ensure that growing E. coli produces sufficient membrane. Identifying the signals that activate and deactivate PlsB will answer the question of how membrane synthesis is synchronized with growth.",

Grass leaves display a prominent proximal-distal (P-D) polarity consisting of a proximal sheath separated from the distal blade by the auricle and ligule. Although proper specification of the four segments is essential for normal morphology, our knowledge is incomplete regarding the mechanisms which influence P-D specification in monocots like maize (Zea mays). Here we report the identification of the gene underlying the semi-dominant, leaf patterning, maize mutant Hairy Sheath Frayed1 (Hsf1). Hsf1 plants produce leaves with outgrowths consisting of proximal segments - sheath, auricle and ligule - emanating from the distal blade margin. Analysis of three independent Hsf1 alleles revealed gain-of-function missense mutations in the ligand binding domain of the maize cytokinin (CK) receptor Zea mays Histidine Kinase1 (ZmHK1) gene. Biochemical analysis and structural modeling suggest the mutated residues near the CK binding pocket affect CK binding affinity. Treatment of wild type seedlings with exogenous CK phenocopied the Hsf1 leaf phenotypes. Results from expression and epistatic analyses indicated the Hsf1 mutant receptor appears to be hypersignaling. Our results demonstrate that hypersignaling of CK in incipient leaf primordia can reprogram developmental patterns in maize.\\n\\nSummaryIncreased cytokinin signaling in the maize Hairy Sheath Frayed1 mutant modifies leaf development leading to changes in pattering, growth and cell identity.",

In this study, we identified and functionally characterized prototypical ANO/SCN/TRPM ion channel expressing pacemaker cells in the basal metazoan Hydra by using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics, immunochemistry, and functional experiments. Unexpectedly, these prototypical pacemaker neurons express a rich set of immune-related genes mediating their interaction with the microbial environment.

The interactions between TAZ1 and its specific targets are related to the cellular hypoxic negative feedback regulation. Previous experiments reported that one of the TAZ1 targets CITED2 is an efficient competitor of another target HIF-1. Here by developing the structure-based models of TAZ1 complexes we have uncovered the underlying mechanisms of the competitions between HIF-1 and CITED2 binding to TAZ1. Our results are consistent with the experimental hypothesis on the competition mechanisms and the apparent affinity. In addition, the simulations prove the dominant position of forming TAZ1-CITED2 complex in both thermodynamics and kinetics. For thermodynamics, TAZ1-CITED2 is the lowest basin located on the free energy surface of binding in the ternary system. For kinetics, the results suggest that CITED2 binds to TAZ1 faster than HIF-1. Besides, the analysis of contact map and{phi} values in this study will be helpful for further experiments on TAZ1 systems.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory authorities require animal toxicity tests for new chemical entities. Organ weight changes are accepted as a sensitive indicator of chemically induced organ damage, but can be difficult to interpret because changes in organ weight might reflect chemically-induced changes in overall body weight. A common solution is to calculate the relative organ weight (organ to body weight ratio), but this inadequately controls for the dependence on body weight - a point made by statisticians for decades, but which has not been widely adopted. The recommended solution is an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), but it is rarely used, possibly because both the method of statistical correction and the interpretation of the output may be unclear to those with minimal statistical training. Using relative organ weights can easily lead to incorrect conclusions, resulting in poor decisions, wasted resources, and an ethically questionable use of animals. We propose to cast the problem into a causal modelling framework as it directly assesses questions of scientific interest, the results are easy to interpret, and the analysis is simple to perform with freely available software. Furthermore, by taking a Bayesian approach we can model unequal variances, control for multiple testing, and directly provide evidence of safety.",

While it is long postulated that they originate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the true identity of MSCs and their in vivo bifurcated differentiation routes into osteoblasts and adipocytes remain poorly understood. Here, by employing single cell transcriptome analysis, we identified MSCs and delineated their bi-lineage differentiation paths in young, adult and aging mice. Among several newly discovered mesenchymal subpopulations, one is a distinct population of adipose-lineage cells that we named marrow environment regulating adipose cells (MERAs). MERAs are non-proliferative, post-progenitor cells that express many mature adipocyte markers but are devoid of lipid droplets. They are abundant in the bone marrow of young mice, acting as pericytes and stromal cells that form numerous connections among themselves and with other cells inside bone, including endothelial cells. Genetic ablation of MERAs disrupts marrow vessel structure, promotes de novo bone formation. Taken together, MERAs represent a unique population of adipose lineage cells that exist only in the bone marrow with critical roles in regulating bone and vessel homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia are thin, actin-based membrane protrusions with roles in sensing external mechanical and chemical cues, such as growth factor gradients in tissues. It was proposed that the chemical sensing role of filopodia is achieved through clearance of activated signaling receptors from filopodia. Type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is a key regulator of normal development and growth, as well as tumor development and progression. Its biological roles depend on its activation upon IGF1 binding at the cell membrane. IGF1R behavior at the cell membrane and in particular in filopodia, has not been established. We found that IGF1 activation led to a gradual reduction in IGF1R puncta in filopodia, and that this clearance depended on actin, non-muscle myosin II, and IGF1R kinase activity. Using single particle tracking of filopodial IGF1R, we established that ligand-free IGF1R undergoes non-directional unidimensional diffusion along the filopodium. Moreover, after initial diffusion, the ligand-bound IGF1R is actively transported along the filopodium towards the filopodium base, and consequently cleared from the filopodium. Our results show that IGF1R can move directionally on the plasma membrane protrusions, supporting a sensory role for filopodia in interpreting local IGF1 gradients.",

We applied multi-region exome sequencing (MSeq) to four treatment-naive dMMR GOAs.

Subclonal driver mutations were common and parallel evolution occurred in RAS, PIK3CA, SWI/SNF-complex genes and in immune evasion regulators. MSeq data and evolution analysis of single region-data from 64 MSI GOAs showed that chromosome 8 gains were among the earliest genetic events and that the hypermutator-phenotype remained active during progression.

    "abstract": "The glucocorticoid receptor directly regulates thousands of genes across the human genome in a cell-type specific manner, governing various aspects of homeostasis. The influence of the glucocorticoid receptor is also seen in various pathologies, including cancer, where it has been linked to tumorigenesis, metastasis, apoptosis resistance, and therapy bypass. Nonetheless, the direct genetic and molecular underpinnings of glucocorticoid action in cancer remain elusive. Here, we dissected the glucocorticoid receptor signalling axis and uncovered the mechanism of glucocorticoid-mediated cancer cell dormancy. Upon glucocorticoid receptor activation cancer cells undergo quiescence, subserved by cell cycle arrest through CDKN1C and reprogramming of signalling orchestrated via FOXO1/IRS2. Strikingly, co-expression of these three genes, directly regulated by glucocorticoid-induced chromatin looping, correlates with a benign molecular phenotype across human cancers, whereas triple loss is associated with increased expression of proliferation/aggressiveness markers. Finally, we show that the glucocorticoid receptor signalling axis is inactivated by alterations of either the chromatin remodelling complex or TP53 in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that the activation of the glucocorticoid receptor leads to cancer cell dormancy, which has several implications in terms of glucocorticoid use in cancer therapy.",

DLC1 expression is dependent on the presence of YAP and TAZ, and constitutive activation of YAP efficiently promotes expression of DLC1. We show that DLC1 limits F-actin fiber formation, integrin-based focal adhesion lifetime and integrin-mediated traction forces. Depletion of endothelial DLC1 strongly perturbs cell polarization in directed collective migration and inhibits the formation of angiogenic sprouts. Importantly, the inability of YAP-depleted endothelial cells to collectively migrate and form angiogenic sprouts can be rescued by ectopic expression of DLC1. Together, these findings reveal that DLC1 fills a hitherto missing link between YAP/TAZ signaling and endothelial dynamics during angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Evolving tumors accumulate thousands of mutations. Technological advances have enabled whole genome sequencing of these mutations in large cohorts, such as those from the Pancancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium. The resulting data explosion has led to many methods for detecting cancer drivers through mutational recurrence and deviation from background mutation rates. However, these methods require a large cohort and underperform when recurrence is low. An alternate approach involves harnessing the variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations in the population of tumor cells in a single individual. Moreover, ultra-deep sequencing of tumors, which is now possible, allows for particularly accurate VAF measurements, and recent studies have begun to use these to determine evolutionary trajectories and quantify subclonal selection. Here, we developed a method that quantifies tumor growth and driver effects for individual samples based solely on the VAF spectrum. Drivers introduce a perturbation into this spectrum, and our method uses the frequency of \\\"hitchhiking\\\" mutations preceding a driver to measure this perturbation. Specifically, our method applies various growth models to identify periods of positive/negative growth, the genomic regions associated with them, and the presence and effect of putative drivers. To validate our method, we first used simulation models to successfully approximate the timing and size of a drivers effect. Then, we tested our method on 993 linear tumors (i.e. those with linear subclonal expansion, where each parent-subclone has one child) from the PCAWG Consortium and found that the identified periods of positive growth are associated with drivers previously highlighted via recurrence by the PCAWG consortium. Finally, we applied our method to an ultra-deep sequenced AML tumor and identified known cancer genes and additional driver candidates. In summary, our method presents opportunities for personalized diagnosis using deep sequenced whole genome data from an individual.",

Here, we identified a terminal 1,3-fucosyltransferase, FUT4, as the key prognostic predictor for lung adenocarcinoma through transcriptomic screens in lung cancer cohorts. Overexpression of FUT4 promotes lung cancer invasion, migration and cell adhesion in vitro and provokes distant metastases in mouse xenograft models. RNA-seq and glycoproteomics analyses revealed that FUT4 mediates aberrant fucosylation of intracellular transport and signal transduction proteins, which facilitates concurrent transcriptional activation of multiple cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cell cycle, and major oncogenic signaling pathways. Notably, knockdown of FUT4 markedly curtailed lung colonization and distant metastases of lung cancer cells in mouse xenograft models. In addition, the metastatic phenotype provoked by FUT4-mediated fucosylproteomic networks can be diminished by targeted pathway inhibitors. Collectively, FUT4 represents a promising therapeutic target in lung cancer metastasis. Our data highlight the potentials for integration of glycomics into precision medicine-based therapeutics.",

In multiple rodent models, Actinium-225 labeled hu11B6-IgG1 ([225Ac]hu11B6-IgG1) has shown promising treatment efficacy. In the current study we investigated options to enhance and optimize [225Ac]hu11B6 treatment. Firstly, we evaluated the possibility of exploiting IgG3, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass with superior activation of complement and ability to mediate FC-gamma-receptor binding, for immunotherapeutically enhanced hK2 targeted alpha-radioimmunotherapy. Secondly, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of a single high activity vs. fractionated activity. Finally, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the genomic signatures of prostate cancer that progressed after targeted alpha therapy. [225Ac]hu11B6-IgG3 was a functionally enhanced alternative to [225Ac]hu11B6-IgG1 but offered no improvement of therapeutic efficacy. Progression free survival was slightly increased with a single high activity compared to fractionated activity. Tumor free animals succumbing after treatment revealed no evidence of treatment associated toxicity. In addition to upregulation of canonical aggressive prostate cancer genes, such as MMP7, ETV1, NTS and SCHLAP1, we also noted a significant decrease in both KLK3 (PSA) and FOLH1 (PSMA) but not in AR and KLK2, demonstrating efficacy of sequential [225Ac]hu11B6 in a mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Structural variants (SVs) may play important roles in human adaption to extreme environments such as high altitude but have been under-investigated. Here, combining long-read sequencing with multiple scaffolding techniques, we assembled a high-quality Tibetan genome (ZF1), with a contig N50 length of 24.57 mega-base pairs (Mb) and a scaffold N50 length of 58.80 Mb. The ZF1 assembly filled 80 remaining N-gaps (0.25 Mb in total length) in the reference human genome (GRCh38). Markedly, we detected 17,900 SVs, among which the ZF1-specific SVs are enriched in GTPase activity that is required for activation of the hypoxic pathway. Further population analysis uncovered a 163-bp intronic deletion in the MKL1 gene showing large divergence between highland Tibetans and lowland Han Chinese. This deletion is significantly associated with lower systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, one of the key adaptive physiological traits in Tibetans. Moreover, with the use of the high quality de novo assembly, we observed a much higher rate of genome-wide archaic hominid (Altai Neanderthal and Denisovan) shared non-reference sequences in ZF1 (1.32%-1.53%) compared to other East Asian genomes (0.70%-0.98%), reflecting a unique genomic composition of Tibetans. One such archaic-hominid shared sequence, a 662-bp intronic insertion in the SCUBE2 gene, is enriched and associated with better lung function (the FEV1/FVC ratio) in Tibetans. Collectively, we generated the first high-resolution Tibetan reference genome, and the identified SVs may serve as valuable resources for future evolutionary and medical studies.",

This study introduces PANPASCO, a computational pan-genome mapping based, pairwise distance method that is highly sensitive to differences between cases, even when located in regions of lineage specific reference genomes. We show that our approach is superior to previously published methods in several datasets and across different Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages, as its characteristics allow the comparison of a high number of diverse samples in one analysis - a scenario that becomes more and more likely with the increased usage of whole-genome sequencing in transmission surveillance.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTuberculosis still is a threat to global health. It is essential to detect and interrupt transmissions to stop the spread of this infectious disease. With the rising use of next-generation sequencing methods, its application in the surveillance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become increasingly important in the last years. The main goal of molecular surveillance is the identification of patient-patient transmission and cluster detection. The mutation rate of M. tuberculosis is very low and stable. Therefore, many existing methods for comparative analysis of isolates provide inadequate results since their resolution is too limited. There is a need for a method that takes every detectable difference into account. We developed PANPASCO, a novel approach for comparing pairs of isolates using all genomic information available for each pair. We combine improved SNP-distance calculation with the use of a pan-genome incorporating more than 100 M. tuberculosis reference genomes for read mapping prior to variant detection. We thereby enable the collective analysis and comparison of similar and diverse isolates associated with different M. tuberculosis strains.",

    "abstract": "Transient neocortical events with high spectral power in the 15-29Hz beta band are among the most reliable predictors of sensory perception: High prestimulus beta event rates in primary somatosensory lead to sensory suppression, most effective at 100-300ms prestimulus latency. However, the synaptic and neuronal mechanisms inducing betas perceptual effects have not been completely localized. We combined human MEG with neural modeling designed to account for these macroscale signals to interpret the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie the influence of beta on tactile detection. Extending prior studies, we modeled the hypothesis that higher-order thalamic bursts, sufficient for beta event generation in cortex, recruit supragranular GABAB inhibition acting on a 300ms time scale to suppress sensory information. Consistency between model and MEG data supported this hypothesis and led to a further prediction, validated in our data, that stimuli are perceived when beta events occur simultaneously with tactile stimulation. The post-event suppressive mechanism explains an array of studies that associate beta with decreased processing, while the during-event mechanism may demand a reinterpretation of the role of beta events in the context of coincident timing.\\n\\nSignificance statementSomatosensory beta events - transient 15-29Hz oscillations in electromagnetic recordings - are thought to be generated when \\\"top-down\\\" bursts of spikes presumably originating in higher-order thalamus arrive in upper layers of somatosensory cortex. Physiological evidence had shown that the immediate action of these top-down projections should be excitatory; however, after a beta event, sensory perception is noticeably inhibited for approximately 300ms. The source of this post-event sensory suppression, in particular, had been unresolved. Using a detailed computational model of somatosensory cortex, we find evidence for the hypothesis that these bursts couple indirectly to GABAB inhibition in upper layers of cortex, and that beta events first briefly disinhibit sensory relay before a longer period of inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Expanded CAG/CTG repeats underlie thirteen neurological disorders, including myotonic dystrophy (DM1) and Huntingtons disease (HD). Upon expansion, CAG/CTG repeat loci acquire heterochromatic characteristics. This observation raises the hypothesis that repeat expansion provokes changes to higher order chromatin folding and thereby affects both gene expression in cis and the genetic instability of the repeat tract. Here we tested this hypothesis directly by performing 4C sequencing at the DMPK and HTT loci from DM1 and HD patient-derived cells. Surprisingly, chromatin contacts remain unchanged upon repeat expansion at both loci. This was true for loci with different DNA methylation levels and CTCF binding. Repeat sizes ranging from 15 to 1,700 displayed strikingly similar chromatin interaction profiles. Our findings argue that extensive changes in heterochromatic properties are not enough to alter chromatin folding at expanded CAG/CTG repeat loci. Moreover, the ectopic insertion of an expanded repeat tract did not change three-dimensional chromatin contacts. We conclude that expanded CAG/CTG repeats have little to no effect on chromatin conformation.",

    "abstract": "An open challenge in human genetics is to better understand the link between genotype variation and the various molecular, cellular, anatomical and physiological systems that it can affect. To address this challenge, we performed genotype-phenotype-systems analysis for accuracy in nine cognitive tasks from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (3,319 individuals aged 8-21 years). We report a region of genome-wide significance within the 3 end of the FBLN1 gene (p=4.6x10-8), associated with nonverbal reasoning, a heritable form of complex reasoning ability. Integration of published brain-specific  omic maps reveals that FBLN1 shows greatest expression in the fetal brain, is a marker of neural progenitor cells, is differentially expressed in schizophrenia and increases genetic risk for bipolar disorder. These findings suggest that nonverbal reasoning and FBLN1 variation warrant further investigation in studies of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychosis. Using genotype-pathway analysis, we identify pathways related to development and to autonomic nervous system dysfunction associated with working memory accuracy. Top-ranking pathway genes include those genetically associated with multiple diseases with working memory deficits, such as schizophrenia and Parkinsons disease, and that are also markers for specific brain cell types. Our findings identify novel molecular players involved in specific cognitive tasks and link variants to genes, pathways, cell types, diseases and drugs.

In the present study, 44 participants completed a Sternberg Task with either intact novel scenes or phase-scrambled scenes, which had similar color and spatial frequency but lacked semantic content. During each condition participants generated a descriptive label and covertly rehearsed or suppressed (repeated \"the\") during the delay. This was easy in the former but more difficult in the later condition where scenes lacked semantic content. Behavioral performance and EEG delay activity was analyzed as a function of maintenance strategy. Performance during WM revealed a benefit of rehearsal for phase-scrambled but not intact scenes. Examination of the absolute amplitude revealed three underlying sources of activity for rehearsal, including the left anterior temporal (TAL), left and midline parietal regions. Increases in alpha and theta activity in TAL were correlated with improvement in performance on WM with rehearsal only when labeling was not automatic (i.e. phase-scrambled scenes), which may reflect differences in labeling and rehearsal (i.e. semantic associations vs. shallow labels). We conclude that rehearsal only benefits memory for visual stimuli that lack semantic information, and that this is correlated with changes in alpha and theta rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with proteostasis disturbances and accumulation of fibrillar proteins into insoluble aggregates. Progressive age-related degeneration of dopamine neurons is a primary cause of motor dysfunctions in Parkinsons disease (PD) and substantial evidence supports critical involvement of -synuclein (-syn) in the etiology of PD. -syn is a cytosolic protein present in high concentrations in pre-synaptic neuronal terminals and a primary constituent of intracellular protein aggregates known as Lewy Neurites or Lewy Bodies. Progression of Lewy pathology is a characteristic feature in the PD brains caused by the prion-like self-templating properties of misfolded -syn. Modelling Lewy pathology progression with application of exogenously prepared -syn preformed fibrils, we discovered that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) prevented formation of -syn aggregates in dopamine neurons in culture and in vivo after viral vector expression of GDNF. These effects were abolished by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of receptor tyrosine kinase Ret, the major GDNF signaling pathway. Similar to GDNF, expression of mutated constitutively active RET (RET_MEN2B) was able to protect dopamine neurons. GDNF protection against -syn pathology progression was abolished by Src and attenuated by Akt pathway inhibitors. For the first time, we have shown the neurotrophic factor-mediated protection against the misfolded -syn propagation in dopamine neurons, uncovered underlying receptor and intracellular signaling pathways. These results for the first time demonstrate that activation of GDNF/RET signaling can be an effective therapeutic approach to prevent Lewy pathology spread at early stages of PD.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/752899v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (57K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f5109dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e4a2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15571c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a10f7d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Most prior studies of age differences in WM have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), but typical DTI metrics (e.g., fractional anisotropy; FA) can reflect multiple neurobiological features, making interpretation challenging. Here, we used fixel-based analysis (FBA) to investigate age-related WM differences observed using DTI in a sample of 45 older and 25 younger healthy adults. Age- related FA differences were widespread but were strongly associated with differences in multifiber complexity (CX), suggesting that they reflected differences in crossing fibers in addition to structural differences in individual fiber segments. FBA also revealed a frontolimbic locus of age-related effects and provided insights into distinct microstructural changes underlying them. Specifically, age differences in fiber density were prominent in fornix, bilateral anterior internal capsule, forceps minor, body of the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract, while age differences in fiber cross section were largest in cingulum bundle and forceps minor. These results provide novel insights into specific structural differences underlying major WM differences associated with aging.",

    "abstract": "Neurons can increase in size dramatically during growth. In many species neurons must preserve their intrinsic dynamics and physiological function across several length scales. For example, neurons in crustacean central pattern generators generate similar activity patterns despite multiple-fold increases in their size and changes in morphology. This scale invariance hints at regulation mechanisms that compensate for size changes by somehow altering membrane currents. Using conductance-based neuron models, we asked whether simple activity-dependent feedback can maintain intrinsic voltage dynamics in a neuron as its size is varied. Despite relying only on a single sensor that measures time-averaged intracellular calcium as a proxy for activity, we found that this regulation mechanism could regulate conductance densities of ion channels, and was robust to changes in the size of the neuron. By mapping changes in cell size onto perturbations in the space of conductance densities of all channels, we show how robustness to size change coexists with sensitivity to perturbations that alter the ratios of maximum conductances of different ion channel types. Our findings suggest that biological regulation that is optimized for coping with expected perturbations such as size changes will be vulnerable to other kinds of perturbations such as channel deletions.",

    "abstract": "Multiscale Entropy (MSE) is used to characterize the temporal irregularity of neural time series patterns. Due to its presumed sensitivity to non-linear signal characteristics, MSE is typically considered a complementary measure of brain dynamics to signal variance and spectral power. However, the divergence between these measures is often unclear in application. Furthermore, it is commonly assumed (yet sparingly verified) that entropy estimated at specific time scales reflects signal irregularity at those precise time scales of brain function. We argue that such assumptions are not tenable. Using simulated and empirical electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 47 younger and 52 older adults, we indicate strong and previously underappreciated associations between MSE and spectral power, and highlight how these links preclude traditional interpretations of MSE time scales. Specifically, we show that the typical definition of temporal patterns via \"similarity bounds\" biases coarse MSE scales - that are thought to reflect slow dynamics - by high-frequency dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that entropy at fine time scales - presumed to indicate fast dynamics - is highly sensitive to broadband spectral power, a measure dominated by low-frequency contributions. Jointly, these issues produce counterintuitive reflections of frequency-specific content on MSE time scales. We emphasize the resulting inferential problems in a conceptual replication of cross-sectional age differences at rest, in which scale-specific entropy age effects could be explained by spectral power differences at mismatched temporal scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such problems may be alleviated, resulting in the indication of scale-specific age differences in rhythmic irregularity. By controlling for narrowband contributions, we indicate that spontaneous alpha rhythms during eyes open rest transiently reduce broadband signal irregularity. Finally, we recommend best practices that may better permit a valid estimation and interpretation of neural signal irregularity at time scales of interest.\n\nAuthor SummaryBrain signals exhibit a wealth of dynamic patterns that that are thought to reflect ongoing neural computations. Multiscale sample entropy (MSE) intends to describe the temporal irregularity of such patterns at multiple time scales of brain function. However, the notion of time scales may often be unintuitive. In particular, traditional implementations of MSE are sensitive to slow fluctuations at fine time scales, and fast dynamics at coarse time scales. This conceptual divergence is often overlooked and may lead to difficulties in establishing the unique contribution of MSE to effects of interest over more established spectral power. Using simulations and empirical data, we highlight these issues and provide evidence for their relevance for valid practical inferences. We further highlight that standard MSE and traditional spectral power are highly collinear in our example. Finally, our analyses indicate that spectral filtering can be used to estimate temporal signal irregularity at matching and intuitive time scales. To guide future studies, we make multiple recommendations based on our observations. We believe that following these suggestions may advance our understanding of the unique contributions of neural signal irregularity to neural and cognitive function across the lifespan.",

    "abstract": "A novel, pleasant taste stimulus becomes aversive if associated with gastric malaise, a form of learning known as conditioned taste aversion (CTA). CTA is common to vertebrates and invertebrates and is an important survival response: eating the wrong food may be deadly. CTA depends on the gustatory portion of the insular cortex (GC) and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) however, its synaptic underpinnings are unknown. Here we report that CTA was associated with decreased expression of immediate early genes in rat GC of both sexes, and with reduced amplitude of BLA-GC synaptic responses, pointing to long term depression (LTD) as a mechanism for learning. Indeed, association of a novel tastant with induction of LTD at the BLA-GC input in vivo was sufficient to change the hedonic value of a taste stimulus. Our results demonstrate a direct role for amygdalocortical LTD in taste aversion learning.",

    "abstract": "The pontine nuclei play a crucial role in sleep-wake regulation. However, pontine ensemble dynamics underlying sleep regulation remain poorly understood. By monitoring population activity in multiple pontine and adjacent brainstem areas, here we show slow, state-predictive pontine ensemble dynamics and state-dependent interactions between the pons and the cortex in mice. On a timescale of seconds to minutes, pontine populations exhibit diverse firing across vigilance states, with some of these dynamics being attributed to cell type-specific activity. Pontine population activity can predict pupil dilation and vigilance states: pontine neurons exhibit longer predictable power compared with hippocampal neurons. On a timescale of sub-seconds, pontine waves (P-waves) are observed as synchronous firing of pontine neurons primarily during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but also during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Crucially, P-waves functionally interact with cortical activity in a state-dependent manner: during NREM sleep, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) precede P-waves. On the other hand, P-waves during REM sleep are phase-locked with ongoing hippocampal theta oscillations and are followed by burst firing in a subset of hippocampal neurons. Thus, the directionality of functional interactions between the hippocampus and pons changes depending on sleep states. This state-dependent global coordination between pontine and cortical regions implicates distinct functional roles of sleep.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (-syn) into intraneuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies (LB). Although it is widely believed that -syn plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD and synucleinopathies, the processes that govern -syn fibrillization and LB formation in the brain remain poorly understood. In this work, we sought to reverse engineer LBs and dissect the spatiotemporal events involved in their biogenesis at the genetic, molecular, biochemical, structural, and cellular levels. Toward this goal, we took advantage of a seeding-based model of -syn fibril formation in primary neurons and further developed this model to generate the first neuronal model that reproduces the key events leading to LB formation; including seeding, fibrillization, and the formation of LB-like inclusions that recapitulate many of the biochemical, structural, and organizational features of LBs found in post-mortem human PD brain tissues. Next, we applied an integrative approach combining confocal and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) imaging methods with biochemical profiling of -syn species and temporal proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to dissect the molecular events associated with LB formation and maturation and to elucidate their contributions to neuronal dysfunctions and neurodegeneration in PD and synucleinopathies. The results from these studies demonstrate that LB formation involves a complex interplay between -syn fibrillization, post-translational modifications, and interactions between -syn aggregates and membranous organelles, including mitochondria and the autophagosome and endolysosome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the process of LB formation and maturation, rather than simply fibril formation, is the major driver of neurodegeneration through disruption of cellular functions and inducing mitochondria damage and deficits, as well as synaptic dysfunctions. Having a neuronal model that allows for unlinking of the key processes involved in LB formation is crucial for elucidating the molecular and cellular determinants of each process and their contributions to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in PD and synucleinopathies. Such a model is essential to efforts to identify and investigate the mode of action and toxicity of drug candidates targeting -syn aggregation and LB formation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLithium is the first-line mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD). In order to interrogate cellular phenotypes related to disease and lithium treatment response, this study used neural precursor cells (NPCs) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from BD patients who are well characterized for clinical lithium response.\\n\\nMethodsBD patients diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria; were recruited from the outpatient services of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India. Clinical lithium response was assessed using the \\\"Alda scale\\\" and \\\"NIMH Retrospective Life chart method\\\". The controls were ethnically matched healthy subjects with no family history of neuropsychiatric illness. NPCs from two BD patients from the same family who clearly differed in their clinical response to lithium were chosen, and compared with healthy population controls. Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and analysis were performed, with and without in vitro lithium (1mM for 7 days). In addition, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cell viability and cell proliferation parameters were examined. Experiments were also performed in 25 LCLs from BD patients (16 lithium responders and 9 lithium non-responders), and 12 healthy control LCLs, to evaluate them in a system amenable to clinical translation.\\n\\nResultsRNA-Sequencing and analysis did not reveal differences in NPCs on in vitro lithium treatment. MMP was lower in BD, both in NPCs and LCLs; reversal with in vitro lithium happened only in LCLs and was unrelated to lithium response. Cell proliferation was higher in BD compared to controls, and there was no change on lithium addition. Cell viability assays indicated greater cell death in BD; which could only be rescued in LCLs of clinical lithium responders. The latter finding was associated with enhanced BCL2 and GSK3B expression with in vitro lithium.\\n\\nDiscussionOverall, our study findings indicate that there are cellular phenotypes related to the disease (mitochondrial potential, cell proliferation) in NPCs and LCLs. We also observed clinical lithium response related phenotypes (cell viability, BCL2/ GSK3B expression) in LCLs. The next step would be to evaluate a larger set of PBMCs from clinical lithium response groups of BD to derive cellular phenotypes related to direct clinical application.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which the neurophysiological and inflammatory responses to brain injury contribute to memory impairments are not fully understood. Recently, we reported that the innate immune receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) enhances AMPA receptor (AMPAR) currents and excitability in the dentate gyrus after fluid percussion brain injury (FPI) while limiting excitability in controls. Here we examine the cellular mediators underlying TLR4 regulation of dentate excitability and its impact on memory performance. In ex vivo slices, astrocytic and microglial metabolic inhibitors selectively abolished TLR4 antagonist modulation of excitability in controls, without impacting FPI rats, demonstrating that glial signaling contributes to TLR4 regulation of excitability in controls. In glia-depleted neuronal cultures from naive mice, TLR4 ligands bidirectionally modulated AMPAR charge transfer demonstrating the ability of neuronal TLR4 to regulate excitability, as observed after brain injury. In vivo TLR4 antagonism reduced early post-injury increases in mediators of MyD88-dependent and independent TLR4 signaling without altering expression in controls. Blocking TNF, a downstream effector of TLT4, mimicked effects of TLR4 antagonist and occluded TLR4 agonist modulation of excitability in slices from both control and FPI rats. Functionally, transiently blocking TLR4 in vivo improved impairments in working memory observed one week and one month after FPI, while the same treatment impaired memory function in uninjured controls. Together these data identify that distinct cellular signaling mechanisms converge on TNF to mediate TLR4 modulation of network excitability in the uninjured and injured brain and demonstrate a role for TLR4 in regulation of working memory function.\n\nHighlightsO_LITLR4 suppresses dentate excitability in controls through signaling involving glia\nC_LIO_LINeuronal TLR4 signaling underlies enhanced dentate excitability after brain injury\nC_LIO_LITNF contributes to TLR4 regulation of excitability in the injured brain\nC_LIO_LIAltering TLR4 signaling impacts working memory performance\nC_LIO_LITLR4 signaling is a potential target to improve working memory after brain trauma\nC_LI",

The mechanisms driving state-changes in V1 result in a 2-3 fold gain of responsiveness to visual stimuli. To determine whether locomotion-mediated increases in response gain improve the perception of spatial acuity we developed a head-fixed task in which mice were free to run or sit still during acuity testing. Spatial acuity, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 cycles/{degrees}, was assessed before and after 3-4 weeks of reward-based training in adult mice. Training on vertical orientations once a day improved the average performance across mice by 22.5 {+/-} 0.05%. Improvement transferred to non-trained orientations presented at 45{degrees}, indicating that the improvement in acuity generalized. Furthermore we designed a second closed-loop task in which acuity threshold could be directly assessed in a single session. Using this design, we established that acuity threshold matched the upper limit of the trained spatial frequency; in two mice spatial acuity threshold reached as high as 1.5 cycles/{degrees}. During the 3-4 weeks of training we collected a sufficient number of stimulus trials in which mice performed above chance but below 100% accuracy. Using this subset of stimulus trials, we found that perceptual acuity was not enhanced on trials in which mice were running compared to trials in which mice were still.

    "abstract": "The cognitive component of motor adaptation declines with aging. Yet, in other motor tasks, older adults appear to rely on cognition to improve their motor performance. It is unknown why older adults are not able to do so in motor adaptation. In order to solve this apparent contradiction, we tested the possibility that older adults require more cognitive resources in unperturbed reaching compared to younger adults, which leaves fewer resources available for the cognitive aspect of motor adaptation. Two cognitive-motor dual-task experiments were designed to test this. The cognitive load of unperturbed reaching was assessed via dual-task costs during the baseline period of visuomotor rotation experiments, which provided us with an estimation of the amount of cognitive resources used during unperturbed reaching. However, since we did not observe a link between dual-task costs and explicit adaptation in both experiments, we failed to confirm this hypothesis. Instead, we observed that explicit adaptation was mainly associated with visuospatial working memory capacity. This suggests that visuospatial working memory of an individual might be linked to the extent of explicit adaptation for young and older adults.",

To address this, transgenic mice with astrocytic expression of the optogenetic Gq-type GPCR, Opto1AR, were established, in which transient Ca2+ elevations similar to those in wild type mice were induced by brief blue light illumination. Activation of cortical astrocytes resulted in an adenosine A1 receptor-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity. Moreover, sensory stimulation with astrocytic activation induced long-term depression of sensory evoked response. At the behavioral level, repeated astrocytic activation in the anterior cortex gradually affected novel open field exploratory behavior, and remote memory was enhanced in a novel object recognition task. These effects were blocked by A1 receptor antagonism. On the other hand, compelling evidence for astrocytic Ca2+-induced diameter changes of arteries was not observed.

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is engaged in a variety of cognitive settings, including social, semantic, temporal, spatial, and self-related tasks. Andrews-Hanna et al. (2010, 2012) proposed that the DMN consists of three distinct functional-anatomical subsystems - a dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) subsystem that supports social processing and introspection about mental states; a medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem that contributes to memory retrieval and construction of mental scenes; and a set of midline core hubs that are involved in processing self-referential information. We examined activity in the DMN subsystems during six different tasks: (1) theory of mind and (2) moral dilemmas (for social cognition), (3) autobiographical memory and (4) spatial navigation (for memory-based construction/simulation), (5) self/other adjective judgement (for self-related cognition), and finally, (6) a rest condition compared to a working memory task. At a broad level, we observed similar whole-brain activity maps for the six contrasts, and some response to every contrast in each of the three subsystems. In more detail, both univariate analysis and multivariate activity patterns showed partial functional separation, much of it in close accord with the proposals of separate dMPFC and MTL subsystems, though with less support for common activity across anterior and posterior regions of a midline core. Integrating social, spatial, self-related, and other aspects of a cognitive situation or episode, multiple components of the DMN may work closely together to provide the broad context for current mental activity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementActivity in the default mode network (DMN) can been found across a wide range of high-level tasks that involve social, semantic, episodic, or self-referential cognition. Given this diversity, an important proposal is that the DMN can be parcellated into subsystems with different cognitive functions. The current experiment employed a wide range of experimental tasks to directly test for functional convergence and heterogeneity between DMN regions. The results support both partial differentiation and integration; working together, distributed DMN regions may assemble the multiple contextual components of a cognitive situation or episode.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge for electroencephalograph (EEG) studies on pediatric populations is that large amounts of data are lost due to artifacts (e.g., movement and blinks). Independent component analysis (ICA) can separate artifactual and neural activity, allowing researchers to remove such artifactual activity and retain a greater percentage of EEG data for analyses. However, manual identification of artifactual components is time consuming and requires subjective judgment. Automated algorithms, like ADJUST and ICLabel, have been validated on adults using the international 10-20 system, but to our knowledge no such algorithms have been optimized for the geodesic sensor net, which is often used with infants and children. Therefore, in an attempt to automate artifact selection for pediatric data collected with geodesic nets, we modified ADJUSTs algorithm. Our \\\"adjusted-ADJUST\\\" algorithm was compared to the \\\"original-ADJUST\\\" algorithm and ICLabel in adults, children, and infants on three different performance measures: respective classification agreement with expert coders, the number of trials retained following artifact removal, and the reliability of the EEG signal after pre-processing with each algorithm. Overall, the adjusted-ADJUST algorithm performed better than the original-ADJUST algorithm and no ICA correction with adult and pediatric data. Moreover, it performed better than ICLabel for pediatric data. These results indicate that optimizing existing algorithms for data collected with a geodesic net improves artifact classification and retains more trials, potentially facilitating EEG studies with pediatric populations.",

    "abstract": "Engaging in a demanding activity while holding in mind another task to be performed in the near future requires the maintenance of information about both the currently-active task set and the intended one. However, little is known about how the human brain implements such action plans. While some previous studies have examined the neural representation of current task sets and others have investigated delayed intentions, to date none has examined the representation of current and intended task sets within a single experimental paradigm. In this fMRI study, we examined the neural representation of current and intended task sets, employing sequential classification tasks on human faces. Multivariate decoding analyses showed that current task sets were represented in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and fusiform gyrus (FG), while intended tasks could be decoded from lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). Importantly, a ventromedial region in PFC/OFC contained information about both current and delayed tasks, although cross-classification between the two types of information was not possible. These results help delineate the neural representations of current and intended task sets, and highlight the importance of ventromedial PFC/OFC for maintaining task-relevant information regardless of when it is needed.",

    "abstract": "Detecting subtle lesions in mammograms indicative of early breast cancer usually requires years of experience. Well-designed training paradigms could be a strong tool for promoting perceptual learning (PL) with rapid and long-lasting improvement in detectability of these subtle mammographic lesions. Given that PL occurs without feedback about the accuracy of subjects responses, the role of feedback has been completely ignored in clinical applications of PL. However, in this study, we found that the contents of the feedback profoundly and differentially influence the formation and retention of PL to detect calcification and architectural distortion lesions, two types of mammographic lesions that are frequently missed in mammographic screenings. We trained subjects to detect one type of lesion in a mammogram and manipulated the content of the response feedback during training for 3 groups (no feedback, correctness only, and both correctness and location of the lesion). We found that PL occurred for both lesions when both correctness and location feedback were provided. PL also occurred for calcifications but not for distortions when only correctness was provided. No learning occurred without feedback for either lesion. A retest conducted six months later showed that PL was retained only in the group with both correctness and location feedback for both types of lesions. In contrast to the general consensus of basic PL studies, our results demonstrate that the content of the response feedback is a determining factor in forming and retaining PL to detect mammographic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Appraising sequential offers relative to an unknown future opportunity and a time cost requires an optimization policy that draws on a learned estimate of an environments richness. Converging evidence points to a learning asymmetry, whereby estimates of this richness update with a bias toward integrating positive information. We replicate this bias in a sequential foraging (prey selection) task and probe associated activation within two branches of the autonomic system, sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, using trial-by-trial measures of simultaneously recorded cardiac autonomic physiology. In general, lower value offers were accepted during periods of autonomic drive, both in the sympathetic (shorter pre-ejection period PEP) and parasympathetic (higher HF HRV) branches. In addition, we reveal a unique adaptive role for the sympathetic branch in learning. It was specifically associated with adaptation to a deteriorating environment: it correlated with both the rate of negative information integration in belief estimates and downward changes in moment-to-moment environmental richness, and was predictive of optimal performance on the task. The findings are consistent with a parallel processing framework whereby autonomic function serves both learning and executive demands of prey selection.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe value of choices (accepting a job) depends on context (richness of the current job market). Learning contexts, therefore, is crucial for optimal decision-making. Humans demonstrate a bias when learning contexts; we learn faster about improvements vs deteriorations. New techniques allow us to cleanly measure fast acting stress responses that might fluctuate with trial-by-trial learning. Using these new methods, we observe here that increased stress - specifically sympathetic (heart contractility) - might help overcome the learning bias (making us faster at learning contextual deterioration) and thereafter guide us toward better context appropriate decisions. For the first time we show that specific building blocks of good decision-making might benefit from short bursts of specific inputs of the stress system.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity is a core and central component of emotion. The myriad social and cognitive challenges faced by humans require flexible modulation of ANS activity for different contexts. In this study, simultaneous activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system was measured using respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and pre-ejection period (PEP), respectively. Samples combined four previous studies (N=325) in which RSA and PEP were collected continuously during a resting baseline and an acute stressor, the Trier Social Stress Task. The concurrent relation between RSA and PEP responses was modeled in order to determine the extent to which SNS and PNS activity is correlated across the task within and between participants, and whether this correlation was moderated by age, race, sex, or baseline RSA and PEP. Overall, RSA and PEP were reciprocally coupled, perhaps reflecting shared regulatory mechanisms in the brain. However, recovery from a stressor was characterized by coactivation. Individuals also vary in the extent to which their SNS and PNS are reciprocally coupled; women, younger adults, and individuals with higher baseline RSA showed more reciprocal coupling than men, older adults, and those with lower baseline RSA, respectively, reflecting greater coordination of physiological responding in the former group.",

    "abstract": "Rapid motor learning may occur in situations where individuals perceive a threat of injury if they do not perform a task well. This rapid motor learning may be facilitated by improved motor performance and, consequently, more errorless practice. As a first step towards understanding the role of perceived threat on rapid motor learning, the purpose of this study was to determine how performance of a motor task is affected in situations where perceived threat of injury is high. We hypothesized that perceived threat of injury in a virtual environment would result in improved performance of a walking task (i.e., walking on a narrow beam). Results demonstrated that increased perceived threat of injury yielded slightly greater, but not statistically significant, balance performance in virtual environments (median percentage of successful steps: 78.8%, 48.3%, and 55.2% in the real low-threat, virtual low-threat, and virtual high-threat environments, respectively). These results may be partially attributed to habituation to threat over time and practice. If implemented carefully, virtual reality technology can be an effective tool for investigating walking balance in environments that are perceived as threatening.",

    "abstract": "Although a wide variety of quantum computers are currently being developed, actual computational results have been largely restricted to contrived, artificial tasks. Finding ways to apply quantum computers to useful, real-world computational tasks remains an active research area. Here we describe our mapping of the protein design problem to the D-Wave quantum annealer. We present a system whereby Rosetta, a state-of-the-art protein design software suite, interfaces with the D-Wave quantum processing unit to find amino acid side chain identities and conformations to stabilize a fixed protein backbone. Our approach, which we call the QPacker, uses a large side-chain rotamer library and the full Rosetta energy function, and in no way reduces the design task to a simpler format. We demonstrate that quantum annealer-based design can be applied to complex real-world design tasks, producing designed molecules comparable to those produced by widely adopted classical design approaches. We also show through large-scale classical folding simulations that the results produced on the quantum annealer can inform wet-lab experiments. For design tasks that scale exponentially on classical computers, the QPacker achieves nearly constant runtime performance over the range of problem sizes that could be tested. We anticipate better than classical performance scaling as quantum computers mature.",

    "abstract": "There are limited reports about the impacts of long-term irrigated and non-irrigated cropping and land-use systems (CLUS) on soil properties and nutrient stocks under smallholder farmers conditions in developing countries. The objective of this research was to examine variation in soil properties and OC and TN stocks across the different CLUS in Dura sub-catchment, northern Ethiopia. Surveys and discussions on field history were used to identify nine CLUS, namely, tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc) Trot)) mono-cropping (TM), maize (Zea mays L.) mono-cropping (MM), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis)-maize intercropping (IC1), red beet (Beta Vulgaris)-maize intercropping (IC2), cauliflower-tef-maize rotation (R1), onion (Allium cepa L.)-maize-onion rotation (R2), treated gully (TG), untreated gully (UTG), and natural forest system (NF). A total of 27 composite soil samples were collected randomly from the CLUS for laboratory analysis. Data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance and PCA. The lowest and highest bulk density was determined from NF (1.19 Mg m-3) and UTG (1.77 Mg m-3), respectively. Soil pH, EC and CEC varied significantly among the CLUS. The highest CEC (50.3 cmolc kg-1) was under TG followed by NF. The highest soil OC stock (113.6 Mg C ha-1) and TN stock (12.2 Mg C ha-1) were found from NF. The PCA chosen soil properties explained 87% of the soil quality variability among the CLUS. Such soil properties and nutrient stocks variability among the CLUS suggested that introduction of suitable management practices are crucial for sustaining the soil system of the other CLUS.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosome positioning DNA sequence patterns (NPS) - usually distributions of particular dinucleotides or other sequence elements in nucleosomal DNA - at least partially determine chromatin structure and arrangements of nucleosomes that in turn affect gene expression. Statistically, NPS are defined as oscillations of the dinucleotide periodicity with about 10 base pairs (bp) which reflects the double helix period. We compared the nucleosomal DNA patterns in mouse, human and yeast organisms and observed few distinctive patterns that can be termed as packing and regulatory referring to distinctive modes of chromatin function. For the first time the NPS patterns in nucleus accumbens cells (NAC) in mouse brain were characterized and compared to the patterns in human CD4+ and apoptotic lymphocyte cells and well studied patterns in yeast. The NPS patterns in human CD4+ cells and mouse brain cells had very high positive correlation. However, there was no correlation between them and patterns in human apoptotic lymphocyte cells and yeast, but the latter two were highly correlated with each other. By their dinucleotide arrangements the analyzed NPS patterns classified into stable canonical WW/SS (W=A or T and S=C or G dinucleotide) and less stable RR/YY (R=A or G and Y =C or T dinucleotide) patterns and anti-patterns In the anti-patterns positioning of the dinucleotides is flipped compared to those in the regular patterns. Stable canonical WW/SS patterns and anti-patterns are ubiquitously observed in many organisms and they had high resemblance between yeast and human apoptotic cells. Less stable RR/YY patterns had higher positive correlation between mouse and normal human cells. Our analysis and evidence from scientific literature lead to idea that various distinct patterns in nucleosomal DNA can be related to the two roles of the chromatin: packing (WW/SS) and regulatory (RR/YY and \\\"anti\\\").\\n\\nAuthor summaryPrecise positioning of nucleosomes on DNA sequence is essential for gene regulatory processes. Two main classes of nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) patterns with a periodicity of 10bp for their sequence elements were previously described. In the 1st class AA,TT and other WW dinucleotides (W= A or T) tend to occur together in the major groove of DNA closest to the histone octamer, while SS dinucleotides (S= G or C) are primarily positioned in the major groove facing outward. In the 2nd class AA and TT are structurally separated (AA backbone near the histone octamer, and TT backbone further away), but grouped with other RR (R is purine A or G) and YY (Y is pyrimidine C or T) dinucleotides. In [8] we also described novel anti-NPS patterns, inverse to the conventional NPS patterns: WW runs inverse to SS, RR inverse to YY. We demonstrated that Yeast nucleosomes in promoters show higher correlation to the RR/YY pattern whereas novel anti-NPS patterns are viable for nucleosomes in the promoters of stress associated genes related to active chromatin remodeling. In the present study we attribute different functions to various NPS patterns: packing function to WW/SS and regulatory - to RR/YY and anti-NPS patterns.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of airway infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa employs several hierarchically arranged and interconnected quorum sensing (QS) regulatory circuits to produce a battery of virulence factors such as elastase, phenazines, and rhamnolipids. The QS transcription factor LasR sits atop this hierarchy, and activates the transcription of dozens of genes, including that encoding the QS regulator RhlR. Paradoxically, inactivating lasR mutations are frequently observed in isolates from CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infections. In contrast, mutations in rhlR are rare. We have recently shown that in CF isolates, the QS circuitry is often \\\"rewired\\\" such that RhlR acts in a LasR-independent manner. To begin understanding how QS activity differs in this \\\"rewired\\\" background, we characterized QS activation and RhlR-regulated gene expression in P. aeruginosa E90, a LasR-null, RhlR-active chronic infection isolate. In this isolate, RhlR activates the expression of 53 genes in response to increasing cell density. The genes regulated by RhlR include several that encode virulence factors. Some, but not all, of these genes are present in the QS regulon described in the well-studied laboratory strain PAO1. We also demonstrate that E90 produces virulence factors at similar concentrations to that of PAO1. Unlike PAO1, cytotoxicity by E90 in a three-dimensional lung epithelium cell model is also RhlR-regulated. These data illuminate a \\\"rewired\\\" LasR-independent RhlR regulon in chronic infection isolates and suggest that RhlR may be a target for therapeutic development in chronic infections.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPseudomonas aeruginosa is a prominent cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen that uses quorum sensing (QS) to regulate virulence. In laboratory strains, the key QS regulator is LasR. Some isolates from patients with chronic CF infections appear to use an alternate QS circuitry in which another transcriptional regulator, RhlR, mediates QS. We show that a LasR-null CF clinical isolate engages in QS through RhlR and remains capable of inducing cell death in an in vivo-like lung epithelium cell model. Our findings support the notion that LasR-null clinical isolates can engage in RhlR QS and highlight the centrality of RhlR gene regulation in chronic P. aeruginosa infections.",

    "abstract": "While the Ponseti method has quickly become the mainstay of clubfoot treatment in most parts of the world, its dissemination and successful implementation in Latin America has been more limited. The additional shortage of orthopedic surgeons in this region makes task sharing a practical approach to address gaps in service provision. We designed an online survey to assess needs, perceptions, and willingness to task share the delivery of the Ponseti method by Ponseti-method-trained physicians across Latin America. Multiple-response questions were summarized and an applied thematic analysis approach was used to analyze free-response questions. We achieved a 66% response rate (31 of 47 experts responded). Our findings illustrate that most physicians feel the need for disseminating and improving Ponseti training, as well as having additional support for clubfoot treatment. While physicians who treat clubfoot have mixed opinions on the role of nonphysicians treating clubfoot, most report logistical concerns and insufficient training as barriers to their inclusion. Given this and the need for improved, more accessible clubfoot care across Latin America, future clubfoot treatment efforts may benefit from incorporating task sharing between orthopedic surgeons and non-physician personnel.",
