    "abstract": "Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) can be conducted at video-rate acquisition speeds when combined with high-speed spatial light modulators and sCMOS cameras, rendering it particularly suitable for live cell imaging. If, however, three-dimensional (3D) information is desired, the sequential acquisition of vertical image stacks employed by current setups significantly slows down the acquisition process. In this work we present a multi-plane approach to SR-SIM that overcomes this slowdown via the simultaneous acquisition of multiple object planes, employing a recently introduced multi-plane image splitting prism combined with high-speed SR-SIM illumination. This strategy requires only the introduction of a single optical element and the addition of a second camera to acquire a laterally super-resolved three-dimensional image stack. We demonstrate the performance of multi-plane SR-SIM by applying this instrument to the dynamics of live mitochondrial network.",

    "abstract": "Membrane integrity at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is tightly regulated and is implicated in metabolic diseases when compromised. Using an engineered sensor that exclusively activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) during aberrant ER membrane lipid composition, we identified pathways beyond lipid metabolism that are necessary to maintain ER integrity in yeast and are conserved in C. elegans. To systematically validate yeast mutants disrupting ER membrane homeostasis, we identified a lipid bilayer stress (LBS) sensing switch in the UPR transducer protein Ire1, located at the interface of the amphipathic and transmembrane helices. Furthermore, transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses pinpoint the UPR as a broad-spectrum compensatory pathway in which LBS and proteotoxic stress-induced UPR deploy divergent transcriptional programs. Together, these findings reveal the UPR program as the sum of two independent stress events and could be exploited for future therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "From yeast to humans, the cell cycle is tightly controlled by regulatory networks that regulate cell proliferation and can be monitored by dynamic visual markers in living cells. We have observed S phase progression by monitoring nuclear accumulation of the FHA-containing DNA binding protein Tos4, which is expressed in the G1/S phase transition. We use Tos4 localization to distinguish three classes of DNA replication mutants: those that arrest with an apparent 1C DNA content and accumulate Tos4 at the restrictive temperature; those that arrest with an apparent 2C DNA content, that do not accumulate Tos4; and those that proceed into mitosis despite a 1C DNA content, again without Tos4 accumulation. Our data indicate that Tos4 localization in these conditions is responsive to checkpoint kinases, with activation of the Cds1 checkpoint kinase promoting Tos4 retention in the nucleus, and activation of the Chk1 damage checkpoint promoting its turnover. Tos4 localization therefore allows us to monitor checkpoint-dependent activation that responds to replication failure in early versus late S phase.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of cell cycle progression and differentiation in retinal progenitor cells is a fundamental feature controlling organ size of the eye in vertebrates. Nance-Horan Syndrome (NHS) is a rare X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the NHS gene. Dysmorphic features of NHS include severe congenital cataracts, micropthalmia, facial dysmorphisms, and visual impairment. In this study we report an evolutionarily conserved role for NHS in vertebrate retinogenesis. Loss of function of nhs leads to small eye size in both zebrafish and Xenopus tropicalis, marked by reduced proliferation but not cell death. Transcriptome analysis of nhs morphant zebrafish eyes revealed a marked upregulation in{Delta} 113p53, an isoform of p53, concomitant with a selective upregulation of p53 responsive genes that inhibit cell cycle progression but not apoptosis. Our data supports a model where Nhs is a negative regulator of{Delta} 113p53 expression and exerts its function through regulation of the p53 pathway to promote expansive growth of retinal progenitor cells prior to differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The movements of cytoplasmic dynein on microtubule (MT) tracks is achieved by two-way communication between the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) and the ATPase domain of dynein via an a-helical coiled-coil stalk, but the structural basis of this communication remains elusive. Here, we regulated MTBD either in high-affinity or low-affinity states by introducing a disulfide bond between the coiled-coils and analyzed the resulting structures by NMRand cryo-EM. In the MT-unbound state, the affinity changes of MTBD were achieved by sliding of the N-terminal -helix by one half-turn, which suggests that structural changes propagate from the ATPase-domain to MTBD. In addition, cryo-EM analysis showed that MT binding induced further sliding of the N-terminal -helix even without the disulfide bond, which suggests the MT-induced conformational changes propagate toward the ATPase domain. Based on differences in the MT-binding surface between the high- and low-affinity states, we propose a potential mechanism for the directional bias of dynein movement on MT tracks.",
