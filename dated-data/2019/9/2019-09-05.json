    "abstract": "Selenoproteins contain the amino acid selenocysteine and are found in all domains of life. The functions of many selenoproteins are poorly understood, partly due to difficulties in producing recombinant selenoproteins for cell-biological evaluation. Endogenous mammalian selenoproteins are produced through a non-canonical translation mechanism requiring suppression of the UGA stop codon, and a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the 3 untranslated region of the mRNA. Here, recombinant selenoproteins are generated in mammalian cells through genetic code expansion, circumventing the requirement for the SECIS element, and selenium availability. An engineered orthogonal E. coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair is used to incorporate a photocaged selenocysteine (DMNB-Sec) at the UAG amber stop codon. Recombinantly expressed selenoproteins can be photoactivated in living cells with spatial and temporal control. Using this approach, the native selenoprotein methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase 1 is generated and activated in mammalian cells. The ability to site-specifically introduce selenocysteine directly in mammalian cells, and temporally modulate selenoprotein activity, will aid in the characterization of mammalian selenoprotein function.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate head mesoderm provides the heart, the great vessels, some smooth and most head skeletal muscle, in addition to parts of the skull. It has been speculated that the ability to generate cardiac and smooth muscle is the evolutionary ground-state of the tissue. However, whether indeed the entire head mesoderm has generic cardiac competence, how long this may last, and what happens as cardiac competence fades, is not clear.\n\nBone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) are known to promote cardiogenesis. Using 41 different marker genes in the chicken embryo, we show that the paraxial head mesoderm that normally does not engage in cardiogenesis has the ability to respond to Bmp for a long time. However, Bmp signals are interpreted differently at different time points. Up to early head fold stages, the paraxial head mesoderm is able to read Bmps as signal to engage in the cardiac programme; the ability to upregulate smooth muscle markers is retained slightly longer. Notably, as cardiac competence fades, Bmp promotes the head skeletal muscle programme instead. The switch from cardiac to skeletal muscle competence is Wnt-independent as Wnt caudalises the head mesoderm and also suppresses Msc-inducing Bmp provided by the prechordal plate, thus suppressing both the cardiac and the head skeletal muscle programmes.\n\nOur study for the first time suggests a specific transition state in the embryo when cardiac competence is replaced by skeletal muscle competence. It sets the stage to unravel the cardiac-skeletal muscle antagonism that is known to partially collapse in heart failure.\n\nSummary statementThe head mesoderm has generic cardiac competence until early head fold stages. Thereafter, cardiac competence fades in the paraxial region, and Bmp promotes head skeletal muscle programmes instead of cardiac programmes.",

    "abstract": "To navigate complex environments, animals must generate highly robust, yet flexible, locomotor behaviors. For example, walking speed must be tailored to the needs of a particular environment: Not only must animals choose the correct speed and gait, they must also rapidly adapt to changing conditions, and respond to sudden and surprising new stimuli. Neuromodulators, particularly the small biogenic amine neurotransmitters, allow motor circuits to rapidly alter their output by changing their functional connectivity. Here we show that the serotonergic system in the vinegar fly, Drosophilamelanogaster, can modulate walking speed in a variety of contexts and in response to sudden changes in the environment. These multifaceted roles of serotonin in locomotion are differentially mediated by a family of serotonergic receptors with distinct activities and expression patterns.",

    "abstract": "Most natural odors are complex mixtures of many volatile components, competing to bind odorant receptors (ORs) expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the nose. To date surprisingly little is known about how OR antagonism shapes neuronal representations in the periphery of the olfactory system. Here, we investigated its prevalence, the degree to which it disrupts OR ensemble activity, and its conservation across related ORs. Calcium imaging microscopy of dissociated OSNs revealed significant inhibition, often complete attenuation, of responses to indole, a commonly occurring volatile associated with both floral and fecal odors, by a set of 36 tested odorants. To confirm an OR mechanism for the observed inhibition, we performed single-cell transcriptomics on OSNs that exhibited specific response profiles to a diagnostic panel of odorants and identified the receptor Olfr743 which, when tested in vitro, recapitulated ex vivo responses. We screened ten ORs from the Olfr743 clade with 800 perfumery-related odorants spanning a range of chemical scaffolds and functional groups, over half of which (430) antagonized at least one of the ten ORs. Furthermore, OR activity outcomes were divergent rather than redundant, even for the most closely related paralogs. OR activity fitted a mathematical model of competitive receptor binding and suggests that normalization of OSN ensemble responses to odorant mixtures is the rule rather than the exception. In summary, we observed OR antagonism, inverse agonism and partial agonism occurring frequently and in a combinatorial manner. Thus, extensive receptor-mediated computation of mixture information appears to occur in the olfactory epithelium prior to transmission of odor information to the olfactory bulb.",

    "abstract": "Cell communication and coordinated cell behavior are hallmarks of multicellular behavior of living systems. However, in many cases, including the ancient and archetypal example of bacterial quorum sensing, the meaning of the communicated information remains a subject of debate. It is commonly assumed that quorum sensing encodes the information on the current state of the colony, including cell density and physical colony confinement. Here, we show that quorum sensing can also be exquisitely sensitive to dynamic changes in the environment, including fluctuations of the prevailing nutrient source. We propose a new signaling mechanism accounting for this sensory capability. This mechanism combines regulation by the commonly studied lux operon-encoded network with the environmentally determined balance of protein synthesis and dilution rates, dependent on the rate of cell proliferation. This regulatory mechanism accounts for observed complex spatial distribution of quorum responses, and emergence of sophisticated processing of dynamic inputs, including temporal thresholds and persistent partial induction following a transient change in the environmental conditions. We further show that, in this context, cell communication in quorum sensing acquires a new meaning: education of cells within a population about the past history of transient exposure to adverse conditions by a subset of induced cells. In combination, these signaling and communication features may endow a cell population with increased fitness in diverse fluctuating environments.",

    "abstract": "H2A.Z mono-ubiquitylation has been linked to transcriptional repression, but the mechanisms involved are not well understood. To address this, we developed a biotinylation-based approach to purify ubiquitylated H2A.Z (H2A.Zub) mononucleosomes for biochemical and genome-wide analyses. We observe that H2A.Zub nucleosomes are enriched for the repressive histone post-translational modification H3K27me3, but depleted of H3K4 methylation and other modifications associated with active transcription. ChIP-Seq analyses reveal that H2A.Zub-nucleosomes are enriched over non-expressed genes, and suggest that it is the relative ratio of ubiquitylated to non-ubiquitylated H2A.Z, rather than absolute presence or absence of H2A.Z ubiquitylation, that correlates with gene silencing. Finally, we observe that H2A.Zub-eniched mononucleosomes preferentially co-purify with transcriptional silencing factors as well as proteins involved in higher order chromatin organization such as CTCF and cohesin. Collectively, these results suggest an important role for H2A.Z ubiquitylation in mediating global transcriptional repression through its recruitment of silencing factors and nuclear architectural proteins.",

Computer simulation studies suggest that the accuracy of the signature increases with the duration of the experiment. Since some assumptions of the computer simulations may be violated, it is important to scrutinize the influence of the experimental duration with real data. Here, we use a highly replicated Evolve and Resequence study in Drosophila simulans to compare the selection targets inferred at different time points. At each time point, approximately the same number of SNPs deviates from neutral expectations, but only 10 % of the selected haplotype blocks identified from the full data set can be detected after 20 generations. Those haplotype blocks that emerge already after 20 generations differ from the others by being strongly selected at the beginning of the experiment and display a more parallel selection response. Consistent with previous computer simulations, our results demonstrate that only Evolve and Resequence experiments with a sufficient number of generations can characterize complex adaptive architectures.",

    "abstract": "In solid tumors, the response to targeted therapy is typically short-lived, as therapy-resistant mutants can quickly expand during therapy. Here we analyze the spectrum of such resistance mutations coexisting in a large population of cancer cells. We use an iterative scheme of artificial evolution to amplify and isolate different resistance mechanisms. As a proof of concept, we apply our scheme to PC-9 cells, a human non-small cell lung cancer cell line with an activating EGFR mutation. The mechanisms we find comprise the well-known gatekeeper-mutation T790M in EGFR, a mutation in NRAS, the amplification of MET-ligand HGF, as well as induction of AKT-mTOR signaling. In this model, a combination of four drugs targeting these mechanisms prevents not only the expansion of resistant cells, but also inhibits the growth of drug-tolerant cells, which can otherwise act as a reservoir for further resistance mutations. These data suggest that a finite number of drugs specifically acting on individual resistant clones may be able to control resistance in oncogenically driven lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding studies using environmental DNA (eDNA) and high throughput sequencing (HTS) are rapidly becoming an important tool for assessing and monitoring marine biodiversity, detecting invasive species, and supporting basic ecological research. Several barcode loci targeting teleost fish and elasmobranchs have previously been developed, but to date primer sets focusing on other marine megafauna, such as marine mammals have received less attention. Similarly, there have been few attempts to identify potentially  universal barcode loci which may be informative across multiple marine vertebrate Orders. Here we describe the design and validation of four new sets of primers targeting hypervariable regions of the vertebrate mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes, which have conserved priming sites across virtually all cetaceans, pinnipeds, elasmobranchs, boney fish, sea turtles and birds, and amplify fragments with consistently high levels of taxonomically diagnostic sequence variation.  In silico validation using the OBITOOLS software showed our new barcode loci outperformed most existing vertebrate barcode loci for taxon detection and resolution. We also evaluated sequence diversity and taxonomic resolution of the new barcode loci in 680 complete marine mammal mitochondrial genomes demonstrating that they are effective at resolving amplicons for most taxa to the species level. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the primer sets with eDNA samples from aquarium communities with known species composition. These new primers will potentially allow surveys of complete marine vertebrate communities in single HTS metabarcoding assessments, simplifying workflows, reducing costs, and increasing accessibility to a wider range of investigators.",

    "abstract": "Las1 is an essential endoribonuclease that is well-conserved across eukaryotes and a newly established member of the HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) nuclease family. HEPN nucleases participate in diverse RNA cleavage pathways and share a short HEPN nuclease motif important for RNA cleavage. While most HEPN nucleases participate in stress activated RNA cleavage pathways, Las1 plays a fundamental role in processing the pre-ribosomal RNA. Underscoring the significance of Las1 function, mutations to the LAS1L gene have been associated with neurological dysfunction. Two juxtaposed Las1 HEPN nuclease motifs create its composite nuclease active site, however the roles of the individual HEPN residues are poorly defined. Here we show through a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies that both Las1 HEPN nuclease motifs are required for nuclease activity and fidelity. Through in-depth sequence analysis and systematic mutagenesis, we define the consensus Las1 HEPN nuclease motif and uncover its canonical and specialized elements. Using reconstituted Las1 HEPN-HEPNchimeras, we define the molecular requirements for RNA cleavage. Intriguingly, both copies of the Las1 HEPN motif are necessary for nuclease specificity revealing that both HEPN motifs participate in coordinating the RNA within the active site. Taken together, our work reveals critical information about HEPN nuclease function and establishes that HEPN nucleases can be re-wired to cleave alternative RNA substrates.",

    "abstract": "Glutamatergic NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK) are critical synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms that regulate the activity of hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory neurons (MNNs) under physiological and pathological states, including lactation and heart failure (HF). Still, whether NMDARs and SK channels in MNNs are functionally coupled, and whether changes in this coupling contribute to exacerbated neuronal activity during HF is at present unknown. In the present study, we addressed these questions using patch-clamp electrophysiology and confocal Ca2+ imaging in a rat model of ischaemic HF. We found that in MNNs of sham rats, blockade of SK channels with apamin (200 nM) significantly increased the magnitude of an NMDAR-evoked current (INMDA). We also observed that blockade of SK channels potentiated NMDAR-evoked firing, and abolished spike frequency adaptation in MNNs from sham, but not HF rats. Importantly, a larger INMDA-{Delta}Ca2+response was observed under basal conditions in HF compared to sham rats. Finally, we found that dialyzing recorded cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (10 mM) increased the magnitude of INMDA in MNNs from both sham and HF rats, and occluded the effects of apamin in the former. Together, our studies demonstrate that in MNNs, NMDARs and SK channels are functionally coupled, forming a local negative feedback loop that restrains the excitatory effect evoked by NMDAR activation. Moreover, our studies also support a blunted NMDAR-SK channel coupling in MNNs of HF rats, standing thus as a pathophysiological mechanism contributing to exacerbated hypothalamic neuronal activity during this prevalent neurogenic cardiovascular disease.",

Chronic cellular senescence is a known mediator of decreased tissue function in aging and disease. Here we investigated whether senescence plays a role in the progressive loss of liver regenerative capacity that develops in young adult mice. We find that following partial hepatectomy, the senescence markers p21, p16Ink4a and p19Arf become dynamically expressed at an age when regenerative capacity decreases. In addition, we demonstrate that treatment with a senescence-inhibiting drug improves regenerative capacity, through targeting of aberrant p21 expression. Surprisingly, we also find that the senescence marker p16Ink4a is expressed in a different cell-population to p21, and is unaffected by senescence targeting. This work suggests that senescence may initially develop as a heterogeneous cellular response, and that treatment with senolytic drugs may aid in promoting organ regeneration.",

However, PCNA is also ubiquitinated during normal S-phase progression. By employing ubiquitination-deficient 293T and RPE1 cells generated through CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we show that this modification promotes cellular proliferation and suppression of genomic instability under normal growth conditions. Loss of PCNA-ubiquitination results in DNA2-mediated but MRE11-independent nucleolytic degradation of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks. This degradation is linked to defective gap-filling in the wake of the replication fork, and incomplete Okazaki fragment synthesis and maturation, thus interfering with efficient PCNA unloading by ATAD5 and subsequent nucleosomal deposition by CAF-1. Moreover, concomitant loss of PCNA-ubiquitination and BRCA2 results in a synergistic increase in nascent DNA degradation and sensitivity to PARP-inhibitors. In conclusion, we show that by ensuring efficient Okazaki fragment maturation, PCNA-ubiquitination protects fork integrity and promotes the resistance of BRCA-deficient cells to PARP-inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Multi-species microbial communities determine the fate of materials in the environment and can be harnessed to produce beneficial products from renewable resources. In a recent example, fermentations by microbial communities have produced medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Tools to predict, assess, and improve the performance of these communities, however, are limited. To provide such tools, we constructed two metabolic models of MCFA-producing microbial communities based on available genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data. The first model is a unicellular model (iFermCell215), while the second model (iFermGuilds789) separates fermentation activities into functional guilds. Ethanol and lactate are fermentation products known to serve as substrates for MCFA production, while acetate is another common co-metabolite during MCFA production. Simulations with iFermCell215 predict that low molar ratios of acetate-to-ethanol favor MCFA production, whereas the products of lactate and acetate co-utilization are less dependent on the acetate-to-lactate ratio. In simulations of an MCFA-producing community fed a complex organic mixture derived from lignocellulose, iFermGuilds789 predicted that lactate was an extracellular co-metabolite that served as a substrate for butyrate (C4) production. Extracellular hexanoic (C6) and octanoic acids (C8) were predicted by iFermGuilds789 to be from community members that directly metabolize sugars. Modeling results provide several hypotheses that can improve our understanding of microbial roles in a MCFA-producing microbiome and inform strategies to increase MCFA production. Further, these models represent novel tools for exploring the role of mixed microbial communities in carbon recycling in the environment, as well as on beneficial reuse of organic residues.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobiomes are vital to human health, agriculture, and protecting the environment. Predicting behavior of self-assembled or synthetic microbiomes, however, remains a challenge. In this work, we used unicellular and guild-based metabolic models to investigate production of medium-chain fatty acids by a mixed microbial community that is fed multiple organic substrates. Modeling results provided insights into metabolic pathways of three medium-chain fatty acid-producing guilds and identified potential strategies to increase production of medium-chain fatty acids. This work demonstrates the role of metabolic models in augmenting multi-omic studies to gain greater insights into microbiome behavior.",

    "abstract": "Following the expanding use and applications of virtual reality in every-day life, dynamic virtual stimuli are of increasing interest in cognitive studies. They allow for control of features such as gaze, expression and movement, which may help to overcome limitations of using either static or poorly controlled real stimuli. In using virtual stimuli however, one must be careful to avoid the uncanny valley effect - where realistic stimuli can be perceived as eerie, and induce an aversion response. At the same time, it is important to establish whether responses to virtual stimuli mirror responses to depictions of a real conspecific. In the current study, we describe the development of a new avatar with realistic features for nonhuman primates, the  primatar. As a first step towards validation, we assessed how monkeys respond to images of this avatar compared to images of real monkeys, and an unrealistic avatar. We also compared responses between original images and scrambled as well as obfuscated versions of these images. We measured looking time to images in six free moving long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and eye movement exploration behaviour in three rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Both groups showed more of such signs of overt attention to original images than scrambled or obfuscated images. In addition, we assessed whether the realistic avatar created an uncanny valley effect through decreased looking time, finding that in both groups, monkeys did not differentiate between real, realistic or unrealistic images. These results provide support for further development of our avatar for use in social cognition studies, and more generally for cognitive research with virtual stimuli in nonhuman primates. Future research needs to shed light on the source of the inconsistent findings for the uncanny valley effect in macaques, to elucidate the roots of this mechanism in humans.",

It was always tempting to implement approaches which do not require MS/MS, yet, they were constantly failing in achieving meaningful depth of quantitative proteome coverage within short experimental times, which is particular important for clinical or biomarker discovery applications. Here, we report on the first successful attempt to develop a truly MS/MS-free and label-free method for bottom-up proteomics. We demonstrate identification of 1000 protein groups for a standard HeLa cell line digest using 5-minute LC gradients. The amount of loaded sample was varied in a range from 1 ng to 500 ng, and the method demonstrated 10-fold higher sensitivity compared with the standard MS/MS-based approach. Due to significantly higher sequence coverage obtained by the developed method, it outperforms all popular MS/MS-based label-free quantitation approaches.",

    "abstract": "Cardio-metabolic disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, with high prevalence in western, industrialized societies relative to developing nations and subsistence-level populations. This stark difference has been attributed to the dietary and lifestyle changes associated with industrialization, but current work has relied on health comparisons between separate, genetically distinct populations to draw conclusions. To more robustly determine how lifestyle impacts health, we collected interview and health biomarker data from a single population undergoing a rapid lifestyle transition. Specifically, we sampled Turkana individuals who practice subsistence-level, nomadic pastoralism (the traditional, ancestral way of life for this group), as well as individuals who no longer practice pastoralism and engage either minimally or strongly with the market economy. Comparisons across this lifestyle gradient revealed clear, non-linear effects of industrialization: only individuals with highly urban, market-integrated lifestyles experience increases in BMI, body fat, blood pressure, and other biomarkers of cardio-metabolic health. These health differences are partially mediated by increased consumption of refined carbohydrates, and more strongly by fine-scale measures of urbanicity. Finally, because many Turkana are transitioning between rural and urban areas within their lifetime, we were able to show that being born in an urban area is associated with worse adult metabolic health, independent of adult lifestyle. Together, these analyses provide comprehensive insight into the timing, magnitude, and causes of health declines in urban, industrialized groups - an area of critical study given the massive public health burden of cardio-metabolic disease and the rate at which developing nations are experiencing lifestyle transitions.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe \\\"mismatch\\\" between evolved human physiology and western, industrialized lifestyles is thought to explain to the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, this hypothesis has been difficult to test in real time. To do so, we studied a traditional pastoralist group--the Turkana--that is currently transitioning from their ancestral way of life to an urban, industrialized lifestyle. We found that Turkana who move to cities exhibit poor cardio-metabolic health, partially because of a shift toward \\\"western diets\\\" high in carbohydrates. We also show that early life urbanicity independently predicts adult health, such that life-long city dwellers will experience the greatest CVD risk. Our work thus uncovers the timing, magnitude, and evolutionary causes of a major health gradient.",

The scientific community is not exempt from this universal problem and several studies have recently been caught manipulating or fabricating data. Current measures to prevent and deter scientific misconduct come in the form of the peer-review process and on-site clinical trial auditors. As recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies have moved biology into the realm of big-data, fraud detection methods must be updated for sophisticated computational fraud. In the financial sector, machine learning and digit-preference are successfully used to detect fraud. Drawing from these sources, we develop methods of fabrication detection in biomedical research and show that machine learning can be used to detect fraud in large-scale omic experiments. Using the raw data as input, the best machine learning models correctly predicted fraud with 84-95% accuracy. With digit frequency as input features, the best models detected fraud with 98%-100% accuracy.

We profiled single-cell transcriptomes of the worldwide-distributed microalga Emiliania huxleyi and its specific coccolithovirus responsible for massive bloom demise. Heterogeneity in viral transcript levels detected among single cells was used to reconstruct the viral transcriptional trajectory and to map cells along a continuum of infection states. This enabled identification of novel viral genetic programs, which are composed of five kinetic classes with distinct promoter elements. The infection substantially changed the host transcriptome, causing rapid shutdown of protein-encoding nuclear transcripts at the onset of infection, while the plastid and mitochondrial transcriptomes persisted to mid- and late stages, respectively. Single-cell transcriptomics thereby opens the way for tracking host-pathogen infection dynamics at high resolution within microbial communities in the marine environment.",

Membrane based isolation and co-culture systems have been utilized in an effort to study EVs and their effects. Nevertheless, improved platforms for the study of small EVs are still needed. Suitable membranes, for isolation and co-culture systems, require pore sizes to reach into the nanoscale. These pore sizes cannot be achieved through traditional lithographic techniques and conventional thick nanoporous membranes commonly exhibit low permeability. Here we utilized nanospheres, similar in size and shape to the targeted small EVs, as patterning features for the fabrication of freestanding SiN membranes (120 nm thick) released in minutes through a sacrificial ZnO layer. We evaluated the feasibility of separating subpopulation of EVs based on size using these membranes. The membrane used here showed an effective size cut-off of 300 nm with the majority of the EVs [&le;]200 nm.

Therefore, the current study aimed to dissect the contribution of ER and ER{beta} to the effects of 17{beta}-estradiol under non-stress and chronic stress conditions. Ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated mice were treated chronically (47 days) with 17{beta}-estradiol (E2), the ER{beta} agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN), the ER agonist propylpyrazole-triol (PPT), or vehicle. On day 15 of treatment, mice from each group were assigned to Chronic Unpredictable Stress (CUS; 28 days) or non-CUS conditions. Mice were assessed for anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Cytokine and chemokine levels, and postsynaptic density protein 95 were measured in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, and adult hippocampal neurogenesis was assessed. Overall, the effects of CUS were more robust that those of estrogenic treatments, as seen by increased immobility in the tail suspension test (TST), reduced PSD-95 expression, reduced neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus, and HPA axis negative feedback dysregulation. However, we also observe CUS-dependent and -independent effects of ovarian status and estrogenic treatments. The effects of CUS on PSD-95 expression, the cytokine milieu, and in TST were largely driven by PPT and DPN, indicating that these treatments were not protective. Independent of CUS, estradiol increased neurogenesis in the dorsal hippocampus, blunted the corticosterone response to an acute stressor, but increased anxiety-like behaviour. These findings provide insights into the complexities of estrogen signaling in modulating depressive-like phenotypes under non-stress and chronic stress conditions.",

Small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) targeting and gene plasmids were used to explore the functional interaction between FN and NLs by using PC12 neuron cells. Furthermore, we used recombinant FN and NL proteins to confirm their interactions. Our studies showed that there were downregulatory effects between FN and the NLs in the embryonic rat colon and different cell lines, indicating that FN and NLs could directly regulate each other, and there is a negative linear correlation between them.

A machine learning algorithm revealed that AKR1B10 was the most informative gene among the 22 DEGs accounting for the classification of the clinical groups. AKR1B10 expression was higher in smokers compared to non-smokers in datasets examining small and large airway epithelia, but not in the data from a study of sorted alveolar macrophages. We next tested whether AKR1B10 expression could be useful in identification of cancer tissue in patients who were not exposed to smoking. AKR1B10 expression was substantially higher in lung cancer specimens compared to matched healthy tissue obtained from nonsmoking individuals (accuracy: 80%, p<0.0001). Finally, we searched the expression of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of AKR1B10 worldwide. We found that the SNP rs782881 was the most frequent mutant allele in the majority of continents. Africa was the continent which exhibited higher frequency of SNPs associated with lower AKR1B10 expression and displayed lower lung cancer incidence and deaths attributable to tobacco.\\n\\nConclusionThe systematic analysis of transcriptomic studies performed here revealed a potential critical link between AKR1B10 expression, smoking and occurrence of lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that safely modulates brain excitability and has therapeutic potential for many conditions. Several studies have shown that anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1) facilitates motor learning and plasticity, but there is little information about the underlying mechanisms. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) it has been shown that tDCS can affect local levels of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Glx (a measure of glutamate and glutamine combined) in adults, both of which are known to be associated with skill acquisition and plasticity; however this has yet to be studied in children and adolescents. This study examined GABA and Glx in response to conventional anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) and high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) targeting the M1 in a pediatric population. Twenty-four typically developing, right handed children ages 12-18 years participated in five consecutive days of tDCS intervention (sham, a-tDCS or HD-tDCS) targeting the right M1 while training in a fine motor task (Purdue Pegboard Task) with their left hand. Glutamate and GABA were measured before and after the protocol (at day 5 and 6 weeks) using conventional MRS and GABA-edited MRS in the sensorimotor cortices. Glutamate measured in the left sensorimotor cortex was higher in the HD-tDCS group compared to a-tDCS and sham at 6 weeks (p = 0.001). No changes in GABA were observed in either sensorimotor cortex at any time. These results suggest that neither a-tDCS or HD-tDCS locally affect GABA and glutamate in the developing brain and therefore it may demonstrate different responses in adults.",

    "abstract": "Nervous systems exploit regularities in the sensory environment to predict sensory input and adjust behavior, and thereby maximize fitness. Entrainment of neural oscillations allows retaining temporal regularities of sensory information, a prerequisite for prediction. Entrainment has been extensively described at the frequencies of periodic inputs most commonly present in visual and auditory landscapes (e.g. >1 Hz). An open question is whether neural entrainment also occurs for regularities at much longer timescales. Here we exploited the fact that the temporal dynamics of thermal stimuli in natural environment can unfold very slowly. We show that ultra-low frequency neural oscillations preserved a long-lasting trace of sensory information through neural entrainment to periodic thermo-nociceptive input as low as 0.1 Hz. Importantly, revealing the functional significance of this phenomenon, both power and phase of the entrainment predicted individual pain sensitivity. In contrast, periodic auditory input at the same ultra-low frequency did not entrain ultra-low frequency oscillations. These results demonstrate that a functionally-significant neural entrainment can occur at temporal scales far longer than those commonly explored. The non-supramodal nature of our results suggests that ultra-low frequency entrainment might be tuned to the temporal scale of the statistical regularities characteristic of different sensory modalities.",

    "abstract": "Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a standard treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma; however, it does not always result in tumor control. Nevertheless, treatment outcome can be improved with monodisperse emulsions of anticancer agents. In this study, the efficacy and safety of a monodisperse miriplatin-Lipiodol emulsion were evaluated in Japanese white rabbits. VX2 tumor was implanted into the left liver lobe of each rabbit. The animals were divided into control and experimental groups (of five animals each) and respectively administered a conventional miriplatin suspension or the emulsion via the left hepatic artery. Computed tomography (CT) was performed before, immediately after, and two days following TACE. All rabbits were sacrificed two days after the procedure. Each tumor was removed and cut in half for assessment of iodine concentration in one half by mass spectroscopy and evaluation of Lipiodol accumulation and adverse events in the other half. Mean Hounsfield unit (HU) values were measured using plain CT images taken before and after TACE. Iodine concentration was higher in the experimental group [1100 (750-1500) ppm] than in the control group [840 (660-1800) ppm]. Additionally, the HU value for the experimental group was higher than that for the control group immediately after [199.6 (134.0- 301.7) vs. 165.3 (131.4-280.5)] and two days after [114.2 (56.1-229.8) vs. 58.3 (42.9-132.5)] TACE. Cholecystitis was observed in one rabbit in the control group. Ischemic bile duct injury was not observed in any group. The results show that Lipiodol accumulation and retention in VX2 tumor may be improved by using a monodisperse emulsion. Moreover, no significant adverse events are associated with the use of the emulsion.",

    "abstract": "Anesthesia is a common practice used in fish research and aquaculture. For both applications, it is important to understand anesthetics effects on the animal and tissues of interest to ensure the validity of data and to improve animal welfare. Captive fish production is only possible with artificial reproduction, and it is known that manipulation is a stressor stimulus in fish. The most common method of determining fish stress responses is measuring the circulating level of cortisol. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations (100, 200, and 300 mg L-1) of the anesthetic tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) on cortisol levels and their influence on the sperm quality maintenance in Rhamdia quelen. After hormonal induction, 28 sexually mature males (average weight = 363.00 {+/-} 71.24 g) were randomly distributed among treatments, and their semen and blood samples were collected. Anesthesia induction time, motility rate, sperm concentration and morphology, plasma cortisol levels, and reproductive hormones concentrations (testosterone, 17--hydroxyprogesterone, and estradiol) were evaluated. Anesthesia with 100 mg L-1 MS-222 presented a longer induction time than that with 200 and 300 mg L-1 MS-222. Sperm motility rate was significantly higher in the control than in the 300 mg L-1 treatment but did not differ among the control, 100, and 200 mg L-1 treatments. Estradiol level was significantly higher in non-anesthetized than in anesthetized fish, but plasma cortisol levels did not differ significantly between treatments (182.50 {+/-} 42.03 ng mL-1). MS-222 anesthetizes fish by blocking the sodium channels, preventing the development of nerve action potentials. However, MS222 at concentrations of 100, 200, and 300 mg L-1 did not prevent stress in South American silver catfish males. In addition, its use did not maintain sperm quality, as it impaired motility and decreased levels of plasma estradiol.",

    "abstract": "Ion channels have recently attracted attention as potential mediators of skin disease. Here, we explored the consequences of genetically encoded induction of the cell volume-regulating Ca2+-activated KCa3.1 channel (Kcnn4) for murine epidermal homeostasis. Doxycycline-treated mice harboring the KCa3.1+-transgene under the control of the reverse tetracycline-sensitive transactivator (rtTA) showed 800-fold channel overexpression above basal levels in the skin and solid KCa3.1-currents in keratinocytes. This overexpression resulted in epidermal spongiosis, progressive epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, itch and ulcers. The condition was accompanied by production of the pro-proliferative and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-{beta}1 (60-fold), IL-23 (34-fold), IL-6 (33-fold), and TNF (26-fold) in the skin. Treatment of mice with the KCa3.1-selective blocker, Senicapoc, significantly suppressed spongiosis and hyperplasia, as well as induction of IL-{beta}1 (-88%), IL-23 (-77%), and IL-6 (-90%). In conclusion, KCa3.1-induction in the epidermis caused expression of pro-proliferative cytokines leading to spongiosis, hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. This skin condition resembles pathological features of eczematous dermatitis and identifies KCa3.1 as a regulator of epidermal homeostasis and spongiosis, and as a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is an important factor that influences potato production; appropriate N fertilizer management can optimize tuber yield and quality and thus reduce the risk of environmental N losses. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different nitrogen (N) application rates (0, 75, 150, 225, 300, and 375 kg ha-1) on the total tuber yield, marketable yield, dry matter content, reducing sugar content, sucrose content of tuber, and fry color index of two potato cultivars (Kennebec and Shepody) in 2016 and 2017. N supply significantly affected tuber yield and processing quality, but these effects depended on the year and/or cultivar. The results indicated that low (75 kg ha-1) and medium-N application rates (150 or 225 kg ha-1) had a positive effect on tuber yield and processing quality; however, high-N application rates (300 and 375 kg ha-1) resulted in lower yield and poor quality. Total and marketable yields responded quadratically to N, and they were optimized at 150 kg ha -1 for Kennebec and 225 kg ha-1 for Shepody in both the years. The processing quality of tubers also responded quadratically with increasing N application rates. The optimal range of N application was approximately 145-185.83 kg ha-1 for Kennebec and approximately 93.44-288.67 kg ha-1 for Shepody according to the processing quality standards of French fried potatoes in China. To achieve the goals of high yield and high quality, N application rates should be 150 kg ha-1for Kennebec and 225 kg ha-1 for Shepody.",

    "abstract": "The control of angiogenic process is of immense importance to the overall health of mankind to avert out-of-control complications such as tumours and cancers. Tapinanthus bangwensis (TBG) is a semi-parasitic plant with multipurpose uses in Nigerian ethno-medicine among which is its anti-infective properties as well as the anti-tumor and restoration of damaged tissues. Despite the wide and varied uses of TBG, the anti-angiogenic investigation of the plant on different host trees is lacking while the documentation and scientific validation of indigenous knowledge on plants use is urgent. The present work focuses on the anti-angiogenic activities of the crude extracts and partitioned fractions of the leaves of Tapinanthus bangwensis (TBG) using the Chick chorio allantoic membrane (CAM) model. The plant was collected from three different host trees namely Albizia lebbeck (AL), Stereospermum kunthianum (SK) and Tabebuia rosea (TR). The methanolic crude extracts and solvent-partitioned fractions of TBG-SK samples were assessed for their anti-angiogenic activities using the chick chorio allantoic membrane (CAM) in ovo and in vitro assay methods respectively. Purification and isolation of major compound(s) in the chloroform fraction of TBG extract obtained from Stereospermum kunthianum host tree (TBG-SK) was carried out using chromatographic and spectroscopic methods (NMR, MS).\\n\\nThe crude methanolic extract of TBG-SK was most potent (100% activity) in the CAM in ovo assay while the chloroform fraction produced a significantly (p<0.05) highest average reduction in blood vessels with resultant formation of large avascular zones on CAM following an in vitro CAM assay. The anti-angiogenic chloroform fraction revealed the presence of a UV-active triterpenoid moiety. Findings from this work, has provided some justification for the folkloric use of TBG and thus forms a potential basis for drug discovery for wide-ranging disease states.",
