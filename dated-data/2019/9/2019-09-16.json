    "abstract": "Microbial communities are complex multi-species assemblages that are characterized by a multitude of interspecies interactions, which can range from mutualism to competition. The overall sign and strength of interspecies interactions have important consequences for emergent community-level properties such as productivity and stability. It is not well understood whether and how interspecies interactions change over evolutionary timescales. Here, we review the empirical evidence that evolution is an important driver of microbial community properties and dynamics on timescales that have traditionally been regarded as purely ecological. Next, we briefly discuss different modelling approaches to study evolution of communities, emphasizing the similarities and differences between evolutionary and ecological perspectives. We then propose a simple conceptual model for the evolution of communities. Specifically, we propose that the evolution of interspecies interactions depends crucially on the spatial structure of the environment. We predict that in well-mixed environments, traits will be selected exclusively for their direct fitness effects, while in spatially structured environments, traits may also be selected for their indirect fitness effects. Selection of indirectly beneficial traits should result in an increase in interaction strength over time, while selection of directly beneficial traits should not have such a systematic effect. We tested our intuitions using a simple quantitative model and found support for our hypotheses. The next step will be to test these hypotheses experimentally and provide input for a more refined version of the model in turn, thus closing the scientific cycle of models and experiments.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome sequencing studies with large sample sizes in humans have discovered a vast quantity of low-frequency variants, providing an important source of information to analyze how selection is acting on human genetic variation. In order to estimate the strength of natural selection acting on low-frequency variants, we have developed a likelihood-based method that uses the lengths of pairwise identity-by-state between haplotypes carrying low-frequency variants. We show that in some non-equilibrium populations (such as those that have had recent population expansions) it is possible to distinguish between positive or negative selection acting on a set of variants. With our new framework, one can infer a fixed selection intensity acting on a set of variants at a particular frequency, or a distribution of selection coefficients for standing variants and new mutations. We apply our method to the UK10K phased haplotype dataset of 3,781 individuals and find a similar proportion of neutral, moderately deleterious, and deleterious variants compared to previous estimates made using the site frequency spectrum. We discuss several interpretations for this result, including that selective constraints have remained constant over time.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome metabolism is defined by the pathways that collectively maintain the genome, including chromosome replication, repair and segregation. Because aspects of these pathways are conserved, chromosome metabolism is considered resistant to evolutionary change. We used the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to investigate the evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism. We experimentally evolved cells constitutively experiencing DNA replication stress caused by the absence of Ctf4, a protein that coordinates the activities at replication forks. Parallel populations adapted to replication stress, over 1000 generations, by acquiring multiple, successive mutations. Whole-genome sequencing and testing candidate mutations revealed adaptive changes in three aspects of chromosome metabolism: DNA replication, DNA damage checkpoint and sister chromatid cohesion. Although no gene was mutated in every population, the same pathways were sequentially altered, defining a functionally reproducible evolutionary trajectory. We propose that this evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism has important implications for genome evolution in natural populations and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Numerous lineages of mushroom-forming fungi have been subject to bursts of diversification throughout their evolutionary history, events that can impact our ability to infer well-resolved phylogenies. However, groups that have undergone quick genetic change may have the highest adaptive potential. As the second largest genus of mushroom-forming fungi, Russula provides an excellent model for studying hyper-diversification and processes in evolution that drives it. This study focuses on the morphologically defined group - Russula subsection Roseinae. Species hypotheses based on morphological differentiation and multi-locus phylogenetic analyses are tested in the Roseinae using different applications of the multi-species coalescent model. Based on this combined approach, we recognize fourteen species in Roseinae including the Albida and wholly novel Magnarosea clades. Reconstruction of biogeographic and host association history suggest that parapatric speciation in refugia during glacial cycles of the Pleistocene drove diversification within the Roseinae, which is found to have a Laurasian distribution with an evolutionary origin in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. Finally, we detect jump dispersal at a continental scale that has driven diversification since the most recent glacial cycles.",

    "abstract": "The Thoroughbred horse is a highly valued domestic animal population under strong selection for athletic phenotypes. Here we present a high resolution genomics-based analysis of inbreeding in the population that may form the basis for evidence-based discussion amid concerns in the breeding industry over the increasing use of small numbers of popular sire lines, which may accelerate a loss of genetic diversity. In the most comprehensive globally representative sample of Thoroughbreds to-date (n = 10,118), including prominent stallions (n = 305) from the major bloodstock regions of the world, we show using pan-genomic SNP genotypes that there has been a highly significant decline in global genetic diversity during the last five decades (FIS R2 = 0.942, P = 2.19 x 10-13; FROH R2 = 0.88, P = 1.81 x 10-10) that has likely been influenced by the use of popular sire lines. Estimates of effective population size in the global and regional populations indicate that there is some level of regional variation that may be exploited to improve global genetic diversity. Inbreeding is often a consequence of selection, which in managed animal populations tends to be driven by preferences for cultural, aesthetic or economically advantageous phenotypes. Using a composite selection signals approach, we show that centuries of selection for favourable athletic traits among Thoroughbreds acts on genes with functions in behaviour, musculoskeletal conformation and metabolism. As well as classical selective sweeps at core loci, polygenic adaptation for functional modalities in cardiovascular signalling, organismal growth and development, cellular stress and injury, metabolic pathways and neurotransmitters and other nervous system signalling has shaped the Thoroughbred athletic phenotype. Our results demonstrate that genomics-based approaches to identify genetic outcrosses will add valuable objectivity to augment traditional methods of stallion selection and that genomics-based methods will be beneficial to actively monitor the population to address the marked inbreeding trend.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the highly valuable global Thoroughbred horse industry, there is no systematic industry-mediated genetic population management. Purposeful inbreeding is common practice and there is an increasing use of popular sires. Inbreeding can lead to population health and fertility decline, but there is little objective genomics-based data for the Thoroughbred to catalyse action and support changes in breeding practices. Here, we describe the most comprehensive genetic analysis in the population among 10,000 Thoroughbreds from the major bloodstock regions of the world and reveal a highly significant increase in inbreeding during the last five decades. The main drivers of genetic diversity are the most influential  breed-shaping sire lines, Sadlers Wells, Danehill and A.P. Indy. We identified genomic regions subject to positive selection containing genes for athletic traits. Our results highlight the need for population-wide efforts to proactively avert the potential increase of deleterious alleles that may impact on animal health in order to safeguard the future of a breed that is admired for its athleticism and enjoyed for sport worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Research into human working memory limits has been shaped by the competition between different formal models, with a central point of contention being whether internal representations are continuous or discrete. Here we describe a sampling approach derived from principles of neural coding as a new framework to understand working memory limits. Reconceptualizing existing models in these terms reveals strong commonalities between seemingly opposing accounts, but also allows us to identify specific points of difference. We show that the discrete versus continuous nature of sampling is not critical to model fits, but that instead random variability in sample counts is the key to reproducing human performance in both single- and whole-report tasks. A probabilistic limit on the number of items successfully retrieved is an emergent property of stochastic sampling, requiring no explicit mechanism to enforce it. These findings resolve discrepancies between previous accounts and establish a unified computational framework for working memory that is compatible with neural principles.",

We formally link these domains; provide a mechanistic understanding of the hippocampal role in generalisation; and offer unifying principles underlying many entorhinal and hippocampal cell-types. We propose medial entorhinal cells form a basis describing structural knowledge, and hippocampal cells link this basis with sensory representations. Adopting these principles, we introduce the Tolman-Eichenbaum machine (TEM). After learning, TEM entorhinal cells include grid, band, border and object-vector cells. Hippocampal cells include place and landmark cells, remapping between environments. Crucially, TEM also predicts empirically recorded representations in complex non-spatial tasks. TEM predicts hippocampal remapping is not random as previously believed. Rather structural knowledge is preserved across environments. We confirm this in simultaneously recorded place and grid cells.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarySimple principles of representation and generalisation unify spatial and non-spatial accounts of hippocampus and explain many cell representations.",

    "abstract": "Dietary alteration is one of the most universally effective aging interventions, making its standardization a fundamental need for model organisms in aging. Here we address the current lack of standardized formulated diet for Turquoise Killifish Nothobranchius furzeri - a promising model organism. We first demonstrated that N. furzeri can be fully weaned onto a standardized commercially available pelleted diet as the sole nutrition when kept in social tanks. We then compared nine somatic and six reproductive parameters between fish fed a typical laboratory diet - frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworms) and fish fed solely on BioMar pellets. Killifish readily consumed the pellets. Although fish consumed 7.5 times less food mass in the form of pellets than bloodworms, they had comparable somatic and reproductive performance. There was no difference between diet groups in body size, specific growth rate, condition or extent of hepatocellular vacuolation. Fish fed a pelleted diet had higher juvenile body mass and more visceral fat. Pellet-fed males had lower liver mass and possessed a lipid type of hepatocellular vacuolation instead of the prevailing glycogen-like vacuolation in the bloodworm-fed group. No significant effect was found on reproductive parameters. The negligible differences between dietary groups and good acceptance of pellets indicates their suitability as a useful starting point for diet standardization (and potential manipulation) in Nothobranchius furzeri.",

    "abstract": "In bacterial systems, CRISPR-Cas transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) has the potential to dramatically expand our ability to regulate gene expression, but we currently lack a complete understanding of the rules for designing effective guide RNA target sites. We have identified multiple features of bacterial promoters that impose stringent requirements on bacterial CRISPRa target sites. Most importantly, we found that shifting a gRNA target site by 2-4 bases along the DNA target can cause a nearly complete loss in activity. The loss in activity can be rescued by shifting the target site 10-11 bases, corresponding to one full helical turn. Practically, our results suggest that it will be challenging to find a gRNA target site with an appropriate PAM sequence at precisely the right position at arbitrary genes of interest. To overcome this limitation, we demonstrate that a dCas9 variant with expanded PAM specificity allows activation of promoters that cannot be activated by S. pyogenes dCas9. These results provide a roadmap for future engineering efforts to further expand and generalize the scope of bacterial CRISPRa.",

    "abstract": "The hormone renin plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis. Normally, renin is synthesized by juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, a specialized group of myoepithelial cells located near the entrance to the kidney glomeruli. In response to low blood pressure and/or a decrease in extracellular fluid volume (as it occurs during dehydration, hypotension, or septic shock) JG cells respond by releasing renin to the circulation to reestablish homeostasis. Interestingly, renin-expressing cells also exist outside of the kidney, where their function has remained a mystery. We discovered a unique type of renin-expressing B-1 lymphocytes that may have unrecognized roles in defending the organism against infections. These cells synthesize and release renin, entrap and phagocyte bacteria and control bacterial growth. The ability of renin-bearing lymphocytes to control infections - which is enhanced by the presence of renin - adds a novel, previously unsuspected dimension to the defense role of renin-expressing cells, linking the endocrine control of circulatory homeostasis with the immune control of infections to ensure survival.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and its co-morbidities are a growing health epidemic. Interactions between genetic background and the environment and behavior (i.e. diet) greatly influence organismal energy balance. Previously, we described obesogenic mutations in the gene Split ends (Spen) in Drosophila melanogaster, and roles for Spen in fat storage and metabolic state. In Spen-deficient storage cells lipid catabolism is impaired, accompanied by a compensatory increase in glycolytic flux and protein catabolism. Here we investigate gene-diet interactions to determine if diets supplemented with specific macronutrients can rescue metabolic dysfunction in Spen-depleted animals. We show that a high-yeast diet partially rescues adiposity and developmental defects. High sugar partially improves developmental timing as well as adult longevity. Gene-diet interactions were heavily influenced by developmental-stage-specific organismal needs: extra yeast provides benefits early in development (larval stages) but becomes detrimental in adulthood. High sugar confers benefits at both larval and adult stages, with the caveat of increased adiposity. A high-fat diet is detrimental according to all tested criteria, regardless of genotype. Whereas Spen depletion influenced phenotypic responses to supplemented diets, diet was the dominant factor in directing the whole-organism steady-state metabolome. Obesity is a complex disease of genetic, environmental, and behavioral inputs. Our results show that diet customization can ameloriate metabolic dysfunction underpinned by a genetic factor.",

These studies provide new insights into the organization of myeloid cells in LNs, and demonstrate that CytoMAP is a comprehensive analytics toolbox for revealing fundamental features of tissue organization in quantitative imaging datasets.",

    "abstract": "Islet transplantation can restore lost glycemic control in type 1 diabetes subjects, but is restricted in its clinical application by limiting supplies of islets and the need for heavy immune suppression to prevent rejection. TNFAIP3, encoding the ubiquitin editing enzyme A20, regulates the activation of immune cells by raising NF-{kappa}B signalling thresholds. Here we show that increasing A20 expression in allogeneic islet grafts resulted in permanent survival for ~45 % of recipients, and >80% survival when combined with subtherapeutic rapamycin. Allograft survival was dependent upon regulatory T cells, was antigen-specific and grafts showed reduced expression of inflammatory factors, but increased TGF{beta} and IL-10. By analysing islets expressing an A20 coding mutation (I325N) that cripples A20s OTU ubiquitin editing domain, we found that A20 regulates intra-graft RIPK1 levels to modulate NF-{kappa}B signalling. Transplantation of I325N islets resulted in increased NF-{kappa}B signalling, graft hyper-inflammation and acute allograft rejection. Neonatal porcine islets (NPI) represent a clinical alternative islet source but are readily rejected. However, forced A20 expression reduced NPI inflammation and increased their function after transplantation. Therapeutic administration of A20 raises NF-{kappa}B signalling thresholds and promotes islet allogeneic survival. Clinically this would allow for reduced immunosuppression supporting the use of alternate islet sources.",

Despite considerable progress in non-enzymatic template copying, true replication remains challenging due to the difficulty of separating the strands of the product duplex. Here, we report a prebiotically plausible solution to this problem in which short  invader oligonucleotides unwind an RNA duplex through a toehold/branch migration mechanism, allowing non-enzymatic primer extension on a template that was previously occupied by its complementary strand. Kinetic studies of single-step reactions suggest that following invader binding, branch migration results in a 2:3 partition of the template between open and closed states. Finally, we demonstrate continued primer extension with strand displacement by employing activated 3'-aminonucleotides, a more reactive proxy for ribonucleotides. Our study suggests that complete cycles of non-enzymatic replication of the primordial genetic material may have been catalyzed by short RNA oligonucleotides.",

    "abstract": "With the amount of data being stored increasing rapidly, there is significant interest in exploring alternative storage technologies. In this context, DNA-based storage systems can offer significantly higher storage densities (petabytes/gram) and durability (thousands of years) than current technologies. Specifically, DNA has been found to be stable over extended periods of time which has been demonstrated in the analysis of organisms long since extinct. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis pipelines have made DNA-based storage a promising candidate for the storage technology of the future.\\n\\nRecently, there have been multiple efforts in this direction, focusing on aspects such as error correction for synthesis/sequencing errors and erasure correction for handling missing sequences. The typical approach is to use separate codes for handling errors and erasures, but there is limited understanding of the efficiency of this framework. Furthermore, the existing techniques use short block-length codes and heavily rely on read consensus, both of which are known to be suboptimal in coding theory.\\n\\nIn this work, we study the tradeoff between the writing and reading costs involved in DNA-based storage and propose a practical scheme to achieve an improved tradeoff between these quantities. Our scheme breaks with the traditional separation framework and instead uses a single large block-length LDPC code for both erasure and error correction. We also introduce novel techniques to handle insertion and deletion errors introduced by the synthesis process. For a range of writing costs, the proposed scheme achieves 30-40% lower reading costs than state-of-the-art techniques on experimental data obtained using array synthesis and Illumina sequencing.\\n\\nThe code, data, and Supplementary Material is available at https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/LDPC_DNA_storage.",

    "abstract": "Gram-positive bacteria divide by forming a thick cross wall. How the thickness of this septal wall is controlled is unknown. In this type of bacteria, the key cell division protein FtsZ is anchored to the cell membrane by two proteins, FtsA and SepF. We have isolated SepF homologues from different bacterial species and found that they all polymerize into large protein rings with diameters varying from 19 to 41 nm. Importantly, these values correlated well with the thickness of their septa. To test whether ring diameter determines septal thickness, we tried to construct different SepF chimeras with the purpose to manipulate the diameter of the SepF protein ring. This was indeed possible and confirmed that the conserved core domain of SepF determines ring diameter. Importantly, when SepF chimeras with a smaller diameter were expressed in the bacterial host Bacillus subtilis, the thickness of its septa also became smaller. These results strongly support a model in which septal thickness is controlled by curved molecular clamps formed by SepF polymers attached to the leading edge of nascent septa. This also implies that the intrinsic shape of a protein polymer can function as a mould to shape the cell wall.\n\nSignificance StatementMany bacteria form a thick cell wall and divide by forming a cross wall. How they control the thickness of their cell wall and cross wall is unknown. In this study we show that in these bacteria the cell division protein SepF forms very large protein rings with diameters that correspond to the diameter of their cross walls. Importantly, when we reduced the diameter of SepF rings in the bacterial host Bacillus subtilis the cross wall also became thinner. These results provide strong evidence that a large protein ring can function as a mould to control the thickness of the cell wall that divides these bacterial cells.",

    "abstract": "KIF7 is a member of the kinesin-4 family and plays critical roles in Hedgehog signaling in vertebrate cells. KIF7 is an atypical kinesin as it binds to microtubules but is immotile. We demonstrate that, like conventional kinesins, KIF7 is regulated by autoinhibition as the full-length motor cannot bind to microtubules whereas truncated versions bind statically to microtubules in cells. Previous work suggested that truncated KIF7 motors bind preferentially to the plus ends of microtubules in vitro, however, we find that truncated KIF7 does not bind preferentially to or track the plus ends of growing microtubules in mammalian cells or in cell extracts. Although the truncated KIF7 did alter microtubule dynamics in cells, this property is not specific to KIF7 as expression of an active kinesin-1 motor also altered microtubule growth rates. The immotile behavior of KIF7 is not due to the extended neck linker domain as its deletion does not activate KIF7 for motility and its presence in a KIF5C/KIF7 chimeric motor does not prevent processive motility. Together this work indicates that the atypical kinesin KIF7 is regulated by autoinhibition to prevent binding to microtubules and alteration of microtubule dynamics in cells.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence surprisingly suggests existence of germline mediated epigenetic inheritance in diverse species including mammals. The evolutionary and health implications as well as the mechanistic plausibility of epigenetic inheritance are subjects of immense current interest and controversy, with integrative analysis expected to provide valuable insights. Here, an unbiased gene set enrichment analysis of existing multi-omics data is presented that readily supports a role of sperm DNA methylome in evolution and disease, as also in developmental mechanisms. In mice, differentially methylated sperm genes in cold induced inheritance specifically overrepresent genes associated with cold adaptation. Similarly, in humans, differentially methylated sperm genes associate with disease and adaptation in general, with specific disease association supported by prior evidence. Further, the sperm genes, like disease and adaptation genes, overrepresent genes known to exhibit higher mutability, loss-of-function intolerance, and haploinsufficiency. Finally, both mouse and human sperm genes show enrichment for genes that retain sperm methylation during development and are developmentally expressed. Together, the present analysis provides one-stop evidence to suggest that sperm DNA methylome acts as a melting pot of gene-environment interaction, inheritance, evolution, and health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Rod-shape of most bacteria is maintained by the elongasome, which mediates the synthesis and insertion of peptidoglycan into the cylindrical part of the cell wall. The elongasome contains several essential proteins, such as RodA, PBP2, and the MreBCD proteins, but how its activities are regulated remains poorly understood. Using E. coli as a model system, we investigated the interactions between core elongasome proteins in vivo. Our results show that PBP2 and RodA form a complex mediated by their transmembrane and periplasmic parts and independent of their catalytic activity. MreC and MreD also interact directly with PBP2. MreC elicits a chance in the interaction between PBP2 and RodA, which is suppressed by MreD. The cytoplasmic domain of PBP2 is required for this suppression. We hypothesize that the in vivo measured PBP2-RodA interaction change induced by MreC corresponds to the conformational change in PBP2 as observed in the MreC-PBP2 crystal structure, which was suggested to be the \\\"on state\\\" of PBP2. Our results indicate that the balance between MreC and MreD determines the activity of PBP2, which could open new strategies for antibiotic drug development.\\n\\nImportanceThe cell envelope of Escherichia coli bears the protective and shape-determining peptidoglycan layer sandwiched between the outer and inner membranes. Length growth in bacteria is accomplished by a protein complex termed elongasome. We used Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) that reports not only on whether proteins interact with each other but also on conformational changes during interactions, to investigate how the elongasome might be activated. RodA and PBP2 provide the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activities needed to synthesize new peptidolgycan during length growth, respectively, and PBP2 activates RodA. We show that the interactions between MreC and MreD with PBP2-RodA alter the nature of the interaction between PBP2 and RodA and hypothesis that the corresponding conformational change in the PBP2-RodA complex allows switching between the  on and  off states of the elongasome.",

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that resting state networks (RSNs) likely display unique temporal complexity fingerprints, quantified by their multi-scale entropy patterns [1]. This is a hypothesis with a potential capacity for developing digital biomarkers of normal brain function, as well as pathological brain dysfunction. Nevertheless, a limitation of [1] was that resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data from only 20 healthy individuals was used for the analysis. To validate this hypothesis in a larger cohort, we used rsfMRI datasets of 1000 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), aged 22-35, each with four 14.4-minute rsfMRI recordings and parcellated into 379 brain regions. We quantified multi-scale entropy of rsfMRI time series averaged at different cortical and sub-cortical regions. We performed effect-size analysis on the data in 8 RSNs. Given that the morphology of multi-scale entropy is affected by the choice of its tolerance parameter (r) and embedding dimension (m), we repeated the analyses at multiple values of r and m including the values used in [1]. Our results reinforced high temporal complexity in the default mode and frontoparietal networks. Lowest temporal complexity was observed in the sub-cortical areas and limbic system. We investigated the effect of temporal resolution (determined by the repetition time TR) after downsampling of rsfMRI time series at two rates. At a low temporal resolution, we observed increased entropy and variance across datasets. Test-retest analysis showed that findings were likely reproducible across individuals over four rsfMRI runs, especially when the tolerance parameter r is equal to 0.5. A strong relationship was observed between temporal complexity of RSNs and fluid intelligence (peoples capacity to reason and think flexibly) through step-wise regression analysis suggesting that complex dynamics of the human brain is an important attribute of high-level brain function. Finally, the results confirmed that the relationship between functional brain connectivity strengths and rsfMRI temporal complexity changes over time scales, likely due to the regulation of neural synchrony at local and global network levels.",

One strategy is to suppress the sensory input whenever the motor system is active, but the cellular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated how motor behaviour modulates signals transmitted by the lateral line of zebrafish, which senses pressure changes around the body of the animal. Activation of motor neurons during fictive swimming caused co-activation of efferent fibers and suppression of synaptic transmission from the primary mechanoreceptors, the hair cells. In some hair cells, a single motor spike inhibited glutamate release by about 50% and block was often complete within 50-100 ms of the start of swimming. All hair cells polarized to be activated by posterior deflections, as would occur during forward swimming, were suppressed by >90%, while only half of those polarized in the anterior direction were inhibited and by an average of just 45%. The selective inhibition of hair cells activated during motor behaviour provides a mechanism for the suppression of self-generated signals while maintaining sensitivity to stimuli originating in the external world.",

In this study, it is posited that Relative Language Distance (RLD; the extent of lexical feature-similarity between bilinguals languages) can affect the extent of cross-linguistic activation and hence influence bilingual language control. This was investigated via an er-fMRI word-translation task on three similar bilingual groups but with varying RLDs: Dutch-English (low-RLD), Hindi-English (intermediate-RLD) and Cantonese-English (high-RLD). Cross-linguistic conflict and the degree of conflict monitoring/control necessary to manage it were expected to increase with decreasing RLD across groups and be appropriately reflected in the activity of conflict monitoring/control neural regions, such as the ACC (anterior cingulate cortex). Analysis revealed a significantly differential ACC response across the groups, reflecting its adaptation to differential conflict monitoring/control demands generated by RLD. The findings provide emerging evidence for RLD as a dimension of bilingualism impacting bilingual language control processes and neurobiology.",

Extracting behaviors, however, requires ascertaining the spatiotemporal patterns of these positions. To provide the missing bridge from poses to actions and their kinematics, we developed B-SOiD - an open-source, unsupervised algorithm that identifies behavior without user bias. By training a machine classifier on pose pattern statistics clustered using new methods, our approach achieves greatly improved processing speed and the ability to generalize across subjects or labs. Using a frameshift alignment paradigm, B-SOiD overcomes previous temporal resolution barriers that prevent the use of other algorithms with electrophysiological recordings.

    "abstract": "Manually collecting landmark data on a large biological sample takes a long time. Several options exist to speed data collection, though each strategy introduces problems or raises concerns of its own. For bilaterally symmetric structures (e.g., crania), some recent papers recommend limiting landmark collection to one side and the midline, then \\\"mirror-reflecting\\\" landmarks across the midline to produce an approximation of the true bilateral configuration. However, where the midline is narrow relative to the bilateral anatomy, net midline landmark deviations from the mid-sagittal axis or plane will distort the mirror-reflected configuration. Here, I test whether this is a substantive concern at the scale of real biology. To do so, I simulate small amounts of mediolateral error on the mean shape from a sample of human mandibles (n = 178), then compare the distribution of simulated forms to variation in the data. I also test how faithfully mirror-reflected configurations replicate bilateral shape and size relationships. In both analyses, midline deviations from symmetry create striking distortions. I go on to show that incorporating a small number of landmarks from the opposite side of the mandible produces far more accurate estimates of bilateral shape than does mirror reflection. Mirror reflection is clearly inappropriate for these data and is likely suspect in all cases of narrow midline morphology.",

    "abstract": "Acquired therapy resistance is a major problem for anticancer treatment, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using an established breast cancer cellular model for endocrine resistance, we show that hormone resistance is associated with enhanced phenotypic plasticity, indicated by a general downregulation of luminal/epithelial differentiation markers and upregulation of basal/mesenchymal invasive markers. Our extensive omics studies, including GRO-seq on enhancer landscapes, demonstrate that the global enhancer gain/loss reprogramming driven by the differential interactions between ER and other oncogenic transcription factors (TFs), predominantly GATA3 and AP1, profoundly alters breast cancer transcriptional programs. Our functional studies in multiple biological systems including culture and xenograft models of MCF7 and T47D lines support a coordinate role of GATA3 and AP1 in enhancer reprogramming that promotes phenotypic plasticity and endocrine resistance. Collectively, our study implicates that changes in TF-TF and TF-enhancer interactions can lead to genome-wide enhancer reprogramming, resulting in transcriptional dysregulations that promote plasticity and cancer therapy-resistance progression.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic GABAB receptors (GABABRs) mediate a slow form of interhemispheric inhibition. Surprisingly, this inhibition has no detectable effect on the somatic membrane potential of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, whereas the action potential (AP) output is robustly decreased even when the input is proximal to the cell body. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we systematically mapped the AP frequency-current (F-I) relationship during dual patch-clamp recordings from soma and apical dendrite. The AP output function was governed by the synergistic interaction between dendritic and somatic compartments as the local input and transfer resistance from dendrite to soma (Kds) depended on the dendritic membrane potential. Thus, Kds doubled at an estimated rate of once per 28.7 mV depolarization due to HCN channel deactivation. In addition, dendritic L-type Ca2+ channels converted individual APs into dendritic Ca2+ spikes causing high-frequency bursts of APs (HFB) during large dendritic depolarization. Activation of dendritic GABABRs greatly reduced both nonlinear mechanisms. While direct block of L-type Ca2+ channels reduced the number of HFBs, K+ channel activation decreased voltage-dependent input and transfer resistances and decreased the AP rate under all conditions. These results highlight the powerful modulation of the input integration in pyramidal neurons by metabotropic receptor-activated K+ channels.",

Effective application of signaling kinetics to developing new therapeutics requires reliable kinetic assays and an analysis framework to extract kinetic pharmacological parameters. Here we describe a platform for measuring arrestin recruitment kinetics to GPCRs using a high quantum yield, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, and a new analysis framework to quantify the recruitment kinetics. The sensor enabled high temporal resolution measurement of arrestin recruitment to the angiotensin AT1 and vasopressin V2 receptors. The analysis quantified the initial rate of arrestin signaling (k{tau}), a biologically-meaningful kinetic drug efficacy parameter, by fitting time course data using routine curve-fitting methods. Biased agonism was assessed by comparing k{tau} values for arrestin recruitment with those for Gq signaling via the AT1 receptor. The k{tau} ratio values were in good agreement with bias estimates from existing methods. This platform potentially improves and simplifies assessment of biased agonism because the same assay modality is used to compare pathways (potentially in the same cells), the analysis method is parsimonious and intuitive, and kinetic context is factored into the bias measurement.",

Here we describe MaGiCaL-BiFC, a lentivirus-based bimolecular fluorescence protein-fragment complementation approach for the high-throughput, genome-scale identification of protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells. After developing and validating this methodology using known protein-protein interaction pairs, we constructed genome-scale pooled BiFC libraries using the human ORFeome cDNA collection. These pooled libraries, containing [~] 12,000 unique human cDNAs, were used to screen for candidate interaction partners of the mitochondrial transmembrane protein TOMM22. Following infection of cells with the TOMM22 bait and the pooled cDNA libraries, cells harboring candidate TOMM22 interacting proteins were isolated from the cell pool via fluorescence activated cell sorting, and identified via microarray analysis. This approach identified several known interaction partners of TOMM22, as well as novel physical and functional partners that link the mitochondrial network to proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. Notably, protein kinase CK2 was identified as a novel physical interaction partner of human TOMM22. We found that this association occurs preferentially during mitosis and involves direct phosphorylation of TOMM22, an event that may lead to attenuation of mitochondrial protein import. Together, this data contributes to the growing body of evidence suggesting eloquent coordination between cell cycle progression and mitochondrial physiology. Importantly, through high-throughput screening and focused validation, our study demonstrates the power of the MaGiCaL-BiFC approach to uncover novel functional protein-protein interactions, including those involving proteins with membrane-spanning domains, or of a transient nature, all within their native cellular environment.",

    "abstract": "We recently described a hydrodynamic mechanism for cytoplasmic transfer between cells, termed cell-projection pumping (CPP). Earlier image analysis related altered SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell morphology, to what we now recognize as CPP uptake of fibroblast cytoplasm. We here examine SAOS-2 phenotype following co-culture with human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) in which organelles were pre-labelled with a fluorescent lipophilic marker. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed of HDF and SAOS-2, cultured either alone or together. FACS forward scatter is proportionate to cell size, and increased for SAOS-2 with high levels of HDF fluorescence uptake (p < 0.004). FACS side scatter is proportionate to internal cell complexity, and increased in SAOS-2 with increasing uptake of HDF fluorescence (p < 0.004), consistent with uptake of HDF organelles. Scratch migration assays revealed that HDF migrated more quickly than SAOS-2 in both isolated cell culture, and following co-culture (p < 0.004). Notably, SAOS-2 with high levels of HDF labelling migrated faster compared with SAOS-2 with low HDF labelling (p < 0.008). A slight and unconvincing reduction in SAOS-2 proliferation was seen (p < 0.02). Similar results were obtained in single additional experiments with A673 and H312 cancer cells. Forward and side scatter results suggest organellar transfer by CPP increases cancer cell morphological diversity. This may contribute to histological pleomorphism relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Also, increased migration of sub-populations of cancer cells with high CPP organellar uptake, may contribute to invasion and metastasis in-vivo. We thus suggest relevance of CPP to cancer diagnosis and progression.",

    "abstract": "Recently approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency, CAR-T cell therapy is a new treatment option for B-cell malignancies. Currently, CAR-T cells are manufactured in centralized facilities and face bottlenecks like complex scaling up, high costs and logistic operations. These difficulties are mainly related to the use of viral vectors and the requirement to expand CAR-T cells to reach the therapeutic dose. In this paper, by using Sleeping Beauty-mediated genetic modification delivered by electroporation, we show that CAR-T cells can be generated and used without the need for ex vivo activation and expansion, consistent with a point-of-care (POC) approach. Our results show that minimally manipulated CAR-T cells are effective in vivo against RS4;11 leukemia cells engrafted in NSG mice even when inoculated after only 4 hours of gene transfer. In an effort to better characterize the infused CAR-T cells, we show that 19BBz T lymphocytes infused after 24h of electroporation (where CAR expression is already detectable) can improve the overall survival and reduce tumor burden in organs of mice engrafted with RS4;11 or Nalm-6 B cell leukemia. A side-by-side comparison of POC approach with a conventional 8-day expansion protocol using Transact beads demonstrated that both approaches have equivalent antitumor activity in vivo. Our data suggests that POC approach is a viable alternative for the generation and use of CAR-T cells, overcoming the limitations of current manufacturing protocols. Its use has the potential to expand CAR immunotherapy to a higher number of patients, especially in the context of low-income countries.",

Tregs activate context-dependent transcriptional programs to adapt effector function to specific tissues; however, the factors controlling tissue-specific gene expression in Tregs remain unclear. Here, we find that the AP-1 transcription factor JunB regulates the intestinal adaptation of Tregs by controlling select gene expression programs in multiple Treg subsets. Treg-specific ablation of JunB results in immune dysregulation characterized by enhanced colonic T helper cell accumulation and cytokine production. However, in contrast to its classical binding-partner BATF, JunB is dispensable for maintenance of effector Tregs as well as most specialized Treg subsets. In the Peyers patches, JunB activates a transcriptional program facilitating the maintenance of CD25- Tregs, leading to the complete loss of T follicular regulatory cells in the absence of JunB. This defect is compounded by loss of a separate effector program found in both major colonic Treg subsets that includes the cytolytic effector molecule granzyme B. Therefore, JunB is an essential regulator of intestinal Treg effector function through pleiotropic effects on gene expression.",

To enable realtime detection of OR activity, we use single cell imaging with genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, Yellow Cameleon or EPAC, which are routinely used for kinetic measurements of Ca2+ or cAMP signaling downstream of various G-protein coupled receptors. We demonstrate that the co-expression of Lucy-Rho tagged variants of ORs together with an accessory protein, RTP1s, in HEK293TN cells is sufficient to detect the activity of a panel of ORs. Using this methodology, we were able to detect both Ca2+ and cAMP signaling downstream of twelve ORs within 2 minutes from the application of odorant.",

Accumulating evidence has indicated that aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in cancer development and progression. However, their clinical values and biological roles in AML remain unclear. In this study, we identified the aberrantly down-regulated profile of hsa_circ_0001947 in AML through microarray analysis and validated it with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, we explored the clinical significance, biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of hsa_circ_0001947 in AML patients. The results showed that lower hsa_circ_0001947 expression was positively correlated with higher leukemia cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood, indicating poor prognosis. Further, bioinformatics analysis demonstrated hsa_circ_0001947-hsa-miR-329-5p-CREBRF network. Down-regulation of hsa_circ_0001947 by siRNA promoted cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, reduced drug resistance of AML cells, and also decreased the expression of its targeted gene, CREBRF. The mimics of hsa-miR-329-5p reduced drug resistance and decreased the expression of CREBRF, while its inhibitor manifested anti-leukemia effects and increased CREBRF expression. In vivo studies revealed that silencing hsa_circ_0001947 promoted the tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice. Collectively, our findings suggest that hsa_circ_0001947 functions as a tumor inhibitor to suppress AML cell proliferation through hsa-miR-329-5p/CREBRF axis, which would be a novel target for AML therapy.",

With abundant glucose, many cells prefer to grow by aerobic glycolysis, or fermentation in yeast. Using 161 natural isolates of fission yeast, we investigated the genetic basis and phenotypic effects of the fermentation-respiration balance. The laboratory and a few other strains were more dependent on respiration. This trait was associated with a missense variant in a highly conserved region of Pyk1. Pyk1 is the single pyruvate kinase in fission yeast, while most organisms possess isoforms with different activity. This variant reduced Pyk1 activity and glycolytic flux. Replacing the  low-activity pyk1 allele in the laboratory strain with the common  high-activity allele was sufficient to increase fermentation and decrease respiration. This metabolic reprogramming triggered systems-level adaptations in the transcriptome and proteome, and in cellular phenotypes, including increased growth and chronological lifespan, but decreased resistance to oxidative stress. Thus, low Pyk1 activity provided no growth advantage but stress tolerance, despite increased respiration. The genetic tuning of glycolytic flux by a single-nucleotide change might reflect an adaptive trade-off in a species lacking pyruvate-kinase isoforms.",

We previously found that Treg-specific deletion of the chromatin remodeling factor Brg1 impairs Treg activation and causes fatal autoimmunity in mice. Here, using a method that allows gene KO to be reversed in a Tamoxifen-dependent manner, we addressed whether reinstating Brg1 expression in the defective Tregs in the sick mice could restore Treg function, and if so, whether such Tregs could stop and resolve the fatal inflammation. We found that reexpressing Brg1 unexpectedly converted the defective Tregs into highly potent \\\"SuperTregs\\\", which effectively rescued the dying mice. Remarkably, Brg1 reexpression in as little as 8% of the Tregs sufficed for the rescue in some cases. Brg1-deleted Tregs in the inflamed mice experienced excessive cytokine stimulation, became hyperactivated upon Brg1 reexpression and then deactivated as the inflammation subsided, suggesting that BRG1 acted in conjunction with inflammation to induce and maintain the SuperTreg phenotype. These data illustrate the power of reversible KO models in uncovering gene functions, and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for IPEX(-related) disorders that exploits the defective Tregs and the inflammatory environment preexisting within the patients.",

Using high-throughput magnetic tweezers, we examined the E. coli RNAp transcription dynamics over a wide range of forces and NTP concentrations. Dwell-time analysis and stochastic modeling identified, in addition to a short-lived elemental pause, two distinct long-lived backtrack pause states differing in recovery rates. We further identified two stochastic sources of transcription heterogeneity: alterations in short-pause frequency that underlie elongation-rate switching, and RNA cleavage deficiency that underpins different long-lived backtrack states. Together with effects of force and Gre factors, we demonstrate that recovery from deep backtracks is governed by intrinsic RNA cleavage rather than diffusional Brownian dynamics. We introduce a consensus mechanistic model that unifies our findings with prior models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe demonstrate high accuracy of whole-genome sequence imputation in large livestock populations where only a small fraction of individuals (2%) had been sequenced, mostly at low coverage.\\n\\nMethodsWe used data from four pig populations of different sizes (18,349 to 107,815 individuals) that were broadly genotyped at densities between 15,000 and 75,000 markers genome-wide. Around 2% of the individuals in each population were sequenced (most at 1x or 2x and a small fraction at 30x; average coverage per individual: 4x). We imputed whole-genome sequence with hybrid peeling. We evaluated the imputation accuracy by removing the sequence data of a total of 284 individuals that had been sequenced at high coverage, using a leave-one-out design. We complemented these results with simulated data that mimicked the sequencing strategy used in the real populations to quantify the factors that affected the individual-wise and variant-wise imputation accuracies using regression trees.\\n\\nResultsImputation accuracy was high for the majority of individuals in all four populations (median individual-wise correlation was 0.97). Individuals in the earliest generations of each population had lower accuracy than the rest, likely due to the lack of marker array data for themselves and their ancestors. The main factors that determined the individual-wise imputation accuracy were the genotyping status of the individual, the availability of marker array data for immediate ancestors, and the degree of connectedness of an individual to the rest of the population, but sequencing coverage had no effect. The main factors that determined variant-wise imputation accuracy were the minor allele frequency and the number of individuals with sequencing coverage at each variant site. These results were validated with the empirical observations.\\n\\nConclusionsThe coupling of an appropriate sequencing strategy and imputation method, such as described and validated here, is a powerful strategy for generating whole-genome sequence data in large pedigreed populations with high accuracy. This is a critical step for the successful implementation of whole-genome sequence data for genomic predictions and fine-mapping of causal variants.",

    "abstract": "We conducted genome sequencing to search for rare variation contributing to early onset Alzheimers disease (EOAD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Discovery analysis was conducted on 493 cases and 671 controls of European ancestry. Burden testing for rare variation associated with disease was conducted using filters based on variant rarity (less than 1 in 10,000 or private), computational prediction of deleteriousness (CADD 10 or 15 thresholds), and molecular function (protein loss-of-function only, coding alteration only, or coding plus non-coding variants in experimentally predicted regulatory regions).\\n\\nReplication analysis was conducted on 16,871 independent cases and 15,941 independent controls. Rare variants in TET2 were enriched in the discovery combined EOAD and FTD cohort (p=6.5x10-8, genome-wide corrected p=0.0037). Most of these variants were canonical loss-of-function or non-coding in predicted regulatory regions. This enrichment replicated across several cohorts of AD and FTD (replication only p=0.0071). The combined analysis odds ratio was 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.2) for AD and FTD. The odds ratio for qualifying non-coding variants considered independently from coding variants was 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.9). For loss-of-function variants, the combined odds ratio (for AD, FTD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which shares clinicopathological overlap with FTD) was 3.2 (95% CI 2.0-5.3). TET2 catalyzes DNA demethylation. Given well-defined changes in DNA methylation that occur during aging, rare variation in TET2 may confer risk for neurodegeneration by altering the homeostasis of key aging-related processes. Additionally, our study emphasizes the relevance of non-coding variation in genetic studies of complex disease.",

Prior to this study, the most comprehensive dataset was collected in 1927. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the possible role of climate change over the last 88 years on the elevational distribution of mammals in the Ethiopian highlands. Between September and November 2015, three of us (EWC, WTS, YM) collected non-volant small mammals at four sites (2900, 3250, 3600, and 4000 m a.s.l.) along the western slope of the Simien Mountains using standardized sampling. Over a four-week period we recorded 13 species, comprising 11 rodents and two shrews, all endemic to the Ethiopian Plateau. We found greatest species richness at mid-elevations (3250 m), consistent with a general pattern found on many other mountains worldwide but less so in Africa. We discovered one potentially new species of shrew. No previously unrecorded rodent species were observed. Finally, we compared our species distribution results to the 1927 dataset and found upward elevational shifts in species ranges, suggesting the role and influence of climate change on the small mammal community. Simien Mountains National Park represents an exceptionally valuable core area of endemism and the best protected natural habitat in northern Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "Chinese indigenous pigs differ significantly from Western commercial pig breeds in phenotypic and genomic characteristics. Thus, building a high-quality reference genome for Chinese indigenous pigs is pivotal to exploring gene function, genome evolution and improving genetic breeding in pigs. Here, we report an ultrahigh-quality phased chromosome-scale genome assembly for a male Luchuan pig, a representative Chinese domestic breed, by generating and combining data from PacBio Sequel reads, Illumina paired-end reads, high-throughput chromatin conformation capture and BioNano optical map. The primary assembly is [~] 2.58 Gb in size with contig and scaffold N50s of 18.03 Mb and 140.09 Mb, respectively. Comparison between primary assembly and alternative haplotig reveals numerous haplotype-specific alleles, which provide a rich resource to study the allele-specific expression, epigenetic regulation, genome structure and evolution of pigs. Gene enrichment analysis indicates that the Luchuan-specific genes are predominantly enriched in Gene Ontology terms for phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, signaling receptor activity and phosphatidylinositol binding. We provide clear molecular evolutionary evidence that the divergence time between Luchuan and Duroc pigs is dated back to about 1.7 million years ago. Meanwhile, Luchuan exhibits fewer events of gene family expansion and stronger gene family contraction than Duroc. The positively selected genes (PSGs) in Luchuan pig significantly enrich for protein tyrosine kinase activity, microtubule motor activity, GTPase activator activity and ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, whereas the PSGs in Duroc pig enrich for G-protein coupled receptor activity. Overall, our findings not only provide key benchmark data for the pig genetics community, but also pave a new avenue for utilizing porcine biomedical models to study human health and diseases.",

We apply a tailored experimental design that eliminates these confounders, and report >80,000 intrinsically covarying gene pairs in mouse embryonic stem cells. These covariances form a network with biological properties, outlining known and novel gene interactions. We provide the first evidence that miRNAs naturally induce transcriptome-wide covariances, and compare the relative importance of nuclear organization, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in defining covariances. We find that nuclear organization has the greatest impact, and that genes encoding for physically interacting proteins specifically tend to covary, suggesting importance for protein complex stoichiometry. Our results lend support to the concept of post-transcriptional  RNA operons, but we further present evidence that nuclear proximity of genes on the same or even distinct chromosomes also provides substantial functional regulation in mammalian single cells.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis (OP) is a highly polygenetic disease which is usually characterized by low bone mineral density. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic loci associated with bone mineral density. However, the biological mechanisms of these loci remain elusive. To identify potential causal genes of the associated loci, we detected trait-gene expression associations by transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) method. It directly imputes gene expression effects from GWAS data, using a statistical prediction model trained on GTEx reference transcriptome data, with blood and skeletal tissues data. Then we performed a colocalization analysis to evaluate the posterior probability of biological patterns: association characterized by a single shared causal variant or two distinct causal variants. The ultimate analysis identified 276 candidate genes, including 3 novel loci, 204 novel candidate genes and 69 replicated from GWAS. The 3 novel loci located at chr6: 72417543, chr15: 69601206, chr21: 30530692, mapping to gene RIMS1, SPESP1, MAP3K7CL. The results of colocalization analysis indicated that 142 of them showing strong evidence of a single shared causal variant and 134 of them showing evidence of joint causal variants. Their biological function was directly or indirectly associated with the occurrence of OP validated by VarElect tool. Several important OP-associated pathways were detected by protein-protein interaction and pathway enrichment analysis. Target genes were further enriched for differential expression genes in osteoblasts expression profiles, e.g. IBSP, affecting calcium and hydroxyapatite binding, and CD44, regulating alternative splicing of gene transcription. Transcriptome fine-mapping identifies more disease-related genes and provide additional insight into the development of novel targeted therapeutics to treat OP.",

    "abstract": "The microcrustacean Daphnia is becoming an organism of choice for genomic and proteomic studies of the effects of environmental stressors. However, the changes in protein expression across the life cycle have not been fully characterized. We analyzed the proteomes of adult females, juveniles, asexually produced embryos, and the ephippia - resting stages containing two sexually produced diapausing freezing- and desiccation-resistant embryos. Overall, we were significantly more likely to detect proteins with known molecular functions than proteins with no detectable orthology. Similarly we could detect those with stronger gene model support, as judged by mutual best BLAST hits between two independent genome assemblies than those without such support. This suggests that we could apply our proteomics pipeline to verify hypothesized proteins, even given less-than-perfect reference gene models. In particular, we observed up-regulation of vitellogenins and down-regulation of actins and myosins in embryos of both types, as compared to juveniles and adults and overrepresentation of cell-cycle related proteins in the developing embryos, as compared to both diapausing embryos and adults. We found upregulation of small heat-shock proteins and redox peroxidases, as well as overrepresentation of stress-response proteins in the ephippium relative to the asexually produced non-diapausing embryos. The ephippium also showed up-regulation of three trehalose-synthesis proteins and down-regulation of a trehalose hydrolase, consistent with the role of trehalose in protection against freezing and desiccation.\\n\\nStatement of significance of the studyFreshwater plankton crustacean Daphnia is rapidly becoming a model organism of choice for ecological and developmental genomics. While there have been several advances towards establishing the protocols and reference datasets for proteomics, a detailed dataset covering several main steps of asexual and sexual phases of Daphnia life cycle is not yet available. Moreover, different versions of D. pulex genome differ in the number of protein-coding genes identified; it is unclear whether these differences are caused by differences between sequenced genotypes or between gene model methodology used.

    "abstract": "What enables our mental activities for thinking verbally or humming in our mind? We hypothesized that the interaction between motor and sensory systems induces speech and melodic mental representations, and this motor-to-sensory transformation forms the neural basis that enables our verbal thinking and covert singing. Analogous with the neural entrainment to auditory stimuli, participants imagined singing lyrics of well-known songs rhythmically while their neural electromagnetic signals were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found that when participants imagined singing the same song in similar durations across trials, the delta frequency band (1-3 Hz, similar to the rhythm of the songs) showed more consistent phase coherence across trials. This neural phase tracking of imagined singing was observed in a frontal-parietal-temporal network - the proposed motor-to-sensory transformation pathway, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula, premotor, intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), primary auditory cortex (HG), and superior temporal gyrus and sulcus (STG & STS). These results suggest that neural responses can entrain the rhythm of mental activity. Moreover, the theta band (4-8 Hz) phase coherence was localized in the auditory cortices. The mu (9-12 Hz) and beta (17-20 Hz) bands were observed in the right-lateralized sensorimotor systems that were consistent with the singing context. The gamma band was broadly manifested in the observed network. The coherent activation in the motor-to-sensory transformation network as well as the frequency-specific activation in the motor, somatosensory, and auditory cortices mediate the internal construction of perceptual representations and form the foundation of neural computations for mental operations.",

    "abstract": "The development of novel analgesics with improved safety profiles to combat the opioid epidemic represents a central question to G protein coupled receptor structural biology and pharmacology: What chemical features dictate G protein or {beta}-arrestin signaling? Here we use adaptively biased molecular dynamics simulations to determine how fentanyl, a potent {beta}-arrestin biased agonist, activates the -opioid receptor (OR). The resulting fentanyl-bound pose provides rational insight into a wealth of historical structure-activity-relationship on its chemical scaffold. We found that fentanyl and the synthetic opioid peptide DAMGO require M153 to induce {beta}-arrestin coupling, while M153 was dispensable for G protein coupling. We propose and validate a mechanism where the n-aniline ring of fentanyl mediates OR {beta}-arrestin through a novel M153 \\\"microswitch\\\" by synthesizing fentanyl-based derivatives that exhibit complete, clinically desirable, G protein biased coupling. Together, these results provide molecular insight into fentanyl mediated {beta}-arrestin biased signaling and a rational framework for further optimization of fentanyl-based analgesics with improved safety profiles.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe global opioid crisis has drawn significant attention to the risks associated with over-use of synthetic opioids. Despite the public attention, and perhaps in-line with the profit-based incentives of the pharmaceutical industry, there is no public structure of mu-opioid receptor bound to fentanyl or fentayl derivatives. A publicly available structure of the complex would allow open-source development of safer painkillers and synthetic antagonists. Current overdose antidotes, antagonists, require natural products in their synthesis which persists a sizable barrier to market and develop better antidotes. In this work we use advance molecular dynamics techniques to obtain the bound geometry of mu-opioid receptor with fentanyl (and derivatives). Based on our in-silico structure, we synthesized and tested novel compounds to validate our predicted structure. Herein we report the bound state of several dangerous fentanyl derivatives and introduce new derivatives with signaling profiles that may lead to lower risk of respiratory depression.",

    "abstract": "Both Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are endemic in Brazil. In Salvador, the capital of the state of Bahia, 2% and 1.5% of the general population is infected with HTLV-1 or HCV. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and the distribution of HTLV/HCV coinfection in Bahia. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Central Laboratory of Public Health for the state of Bahia (LACEN-BA). All samples in the LACEN database submitted to serological testing for anti-HCV (chemiluminescence) and anti-HTLV-1/2 (chemiluminescence/ELISA and Western blot) from 2004 to 2013 were included. Infection rate was expressed as the number of infected individuals per 100,000 inhabitants in a given municipality; municipalities were grouped by microregion for further analysis. A total of 120,192 samples originating from 358 of the 417 municipalities in Bahia (85.8%) were evaluated. The overall HCV coinfection rate in HTLV-positive was 14.31% [2.8 (ranging from 0.4 to 8.0) per 100,000 inhabitants.] Twenty-one (5%) of the municipalities reported at least one case of HTLV/HCV coinfection. Most cases (87%) were concentrated in three microregions (Salvador: 79%, Ilheus/Itabuna: 5%, Porto Seguro: 3%). Coinfection occurred more frequently in males (51%) with a mean age of 59 [(IQR): 46 - 59] years. HTLV/HCV coinfection in the state of Bahia was more frequently found among males living in the microregions of Salvador, Ilheus/Itabuna and Porto Seguro, all of which are known to be endemic for HTLV infection.

    "abstract": "The ability of bees and ants to learn long visually guided routes in complex environments is perhaps one of the most spectacular pieces of evidence for the impressive power of their small brains. While flying bees can visit flowers in an optimised sequence over kilometres, walking ants can precisely recapitulate routes of up to a hundred metres in complex environments. It is clear that route following depends largely on learnt visual information and we have good idea how views can guide individuals along them, however little is known about the mechanisms that control route learning and development. Here we show that ants in natural environments can actively learn a route detour to avoid a pit trap and that this depends on a process analogous to aversive trace conditioning. Views experienced before falling into the trap become associated with the ensuing negative outcome and thus trigger salutary turns on the subsequent trip. This drives the ants to orient away from the goal direction and avoid the trap. If the pit is avoided, the novel views experienced during the detour become positively reinforced and the new route crystallises. We discuss how such an interplay between appetitive and aversive memories might be implemented in insect neural circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of noninvasive transcranial electrical brain stimulation. By optimizing the current distribution of each electrode on the scalp, the stimulation can be guided to a target brain region using a tDCS dense electrode array system. However, previous studies have yielded simple results using optimization schemes in single target stimulation cases. The detailed parameter settings for each optimization scheme and the associated simulation results have not been comprehensively assessed. In this study, we investigated parameter settings of optimization schemes in detail in both single target and multi-target cases. Two optimization schemes, minimum least squares (MLS) and maximum electrical field strength (ME), were examined in this study. MLS minimizes the squared errors between the expected electrical field and the estimated electrical field, whereas ME maximizes the electrical field strength in the target region. We constructed a five layer finite-element head model with 64 electrodes placed on the scalp according to the EEG 10/10 system for simulation. We evaluated the effects of stimulation using these two schemes under three conditions, 1) single target stimulation, 2) multi-target stimulation, and 3) multi-target stimulation under specific task activation, which shown that directly using MLS and ME scheme in multi-target stimulation case may lead to a wrong result. We also reported the improved results fixed by our proposed weighted MLS and weighted ME schemes which take detailed parameter settings into consideration. Our results indicate that the parameter settings in each optimization scheme greatly affected the final stimulation results, especially in the case of multi-target stimulation, and thus, indicate that the parameter settings of each optimization scheme should be carefully considered according to the expected stimulation mode. Our results also suggest that, by calculating the parameters through our proposed methods, the weighted ME and weighted MLS scheme can precisely distribute energy into each target brain region.",

    "abstract": "The DNA damage response (DDR) comprises multiple functions that collectively preserve genomic integrity and suppress tumorigenesis. The Mre11 complex and ATM govern a major axis of the DDR and several lines of evidence implicate that axis in tumor suppression. Components of the Mre11 complex are mutated in approximately five percent of human cancers. Inherited mutations of complex members cause severe chromosome instability syndromes, such as Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome, which is associated with strong predisposition to malignancy. And in mice, Mre11 complex mutations are markedly more susceptible to oncogene-induced carcinogenesis. The complex is integral to all modes of double strand break (DSB) repair and is required for the activation of ATM to effect DNA damage signaling. To understand which functions of the Mre11 complex are important for tumor suppression, we undertook mining of cancer genomic data from the clinical sequencing program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which includes the Mre11 complex among the 468 genes assessed. Twenty five mutations in MRE11 and RAD50 were modeled in S.cerevisiae and in vitro. The mutations were chosen based on recurrence and conservation between human and yeast. We found that a significant fraction of tumor-borne RAD50 and MRE11 mutations exhibited separation of function phenotypes wherein Tel1/ATM activation was defective while DNA repair functions were mildly or not affected. At the molecular level, the gene products of RAD50 mutations exhibited defects in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The data reflect the importance of Rad50 ATPase activity for Tel1/ATM activation and suggest that inactivation of ATM signaling confers an advantage to burgeoning tumor cells.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA complex network of functions is required for suppressing tumorigenesis. These include processes that regulate cell growth and differentiation, processes that repair damage to DNA and thereby prevent cancer promoting mutations and signaling pathways that lead to growth arrest and programmed cell death. The Mre11 complex influences both signaling and DNA repair. To understand its role in tumor suppression, we characterized mutations affecting members of the Mre11 complex that were uncovered through cancer genomic analyses. The data reveal that the signaling functions of the Mre11 complex are important for tumor suppression to a greater degree than its role in DNA repair.",

    "abstract": "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) plays an important role in mediating global levels of methane by catalyzing a reversible reaction that leads to the production or consumption of this potent greenhouse gas in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea. In methanogenic archaea, the alpha subunit of MCR (McrA) typically contains four to six post-translationally modified amino acids near the active site. Recent studies have identified genes that install two of these modifications (thioglycine and 5-(S)-methylarginine), yet little is known about the installation and function of the remaining post-translationally modified residues. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that a dedicated SAM-dependent methyltransferase encoded by a gene we designated mcmA is responsible for formation of S-methylcysteine in Methanosarcina acetivorans McrA. Phenotypic analysis of mutants incapable of cysteine methylation suggests that the S-methylcysteine residue plays an important role in adaptation to a mesophilic lifestyle. To examine the interactions between the S-methylcysteine residue and the previously characterized thioglycine, 5-(S)-methylarginine modifications, we generated M. acetivorans mutants lacking the three known modification genes in all possible combinations. Phenotypic analyses revealed complex, physiologically relevant interactions between the modified residues, which alter the thermal stability of MCR in a combinatorial fashion that is not readily predictable from the phenotypes of single mutants. Surprisingly, high-resolution crystal structures of the various unmodified MCRs were indistinguishable from the fully modified enzyme, suggesting that interactions between the post-translationally modified residues do not exert a major influence on the physical structure of the enzyme, but rather serve to fine-tune the activity and efficiency of MCR.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIn epidemiological studies, cross-tabulations are a simple but important tool for understanding the distribution of socio-demographic characteristics among study participants. They become more useful when comparisons are presented using a by-group variable such as key demographic characteristic or an outcome status; for instance, sex or the presence or absence of a disease status. Most available statistical analysis software can easily perform cross-tabulations, however, output from these must be processed further to make it readily available for review and use in a publication. In addition, performing three-way cross-tabulations of complex survey data such as those required to show the distribution of disease prevalence across multiple factors and a by-group variable is not easily implemented directly using available standard procedures of commonly used statistical software.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a generic SAS macro, %svy_freqs, to create quality publication-ready tables from cross-tabulations between a factor and a by-group variable given a third variable using survey or non-survey data. The SAS macro also performs classical two-way cross-tabulations and refines output into publication-quality tables. It provides extra features not available in existing procedures such as ability to incorporate parameters for survey design and replication-based variance estimation methods, performing validation checks for input parameters, transparently formatting character variable values into numeric ones and allowing for generalizability.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate the application of the SAS macro in the analysis of data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a complex survey designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States (U.S.).\\n\\nConclusionThe SAS code use to develop the macro is simple yet comprehensive, easy to follow, straightforward for the end user and simple for a SAS programmer to extend. The SAS macro has shown to shorten turn-around time for statistical analysis, eliminate errors when preparing output, and support reproducible research.",

    "abstract": "RationaleHigh-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the deadliest of gynecological cancers due to high rate of recurrence and acquired chemoresistance. Mutation and activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway has been linked to cancer cell proliferation and therapeutic resistance in numerous cancers. While RAS mutations are not commonly observed in HGSOC, less is known about downstream pathway activation. We therefore sought to investigate the role of MEK1/2 signaling in ovarian cancer.\\n\\nMethodsMEK1/2 pathway activity was evaluated in clinical HGSOC tissue samples and ovarian cancer cell lines by using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and RT-qPCR. OVCAR8 and PEO4 HGSOC cell lines were used to assess the effect of MEK1/2 inhibition on cell viability, proliferation rate, and stem-like characteristics. Xenografts were used in mice to investigate the effect of MEK1/2 inhibition on tumor growth in vivo. A drug washout experimental model was used to study the lasting effects of MEK1/2 inhibition therapy.\\n\\nResultsMEK1/2 signaling is active in a majority of HGSOC tissue samples and cell lines. MEK1/2 is further stimulated by cisplatin treatment, suggesting that MEK1/2 activation may play a role in chemotherapy resistance. The MEK1/2 inhibitor, trametinib, drastically inhibits MEK1/2 downstream signaling activity, causes prominent cell cycle arrest in the G1/0-phase in cell cultures, and reduces the rate of tumor growth in vivo, but does not induce cell death. Cells treated with trametinib display a high CD133+ fraction and increased expression of stemness-associated genes. Transient trametinib treatment causes long-term increases in a high ALDH1 activity subpopulation of cells that possess the capability of surviving and growing in non-adherent conditions.\\n\\nConclusionsMEK1/2 inhibition in HGSOC cells efficiently inhibits proliferation and tumor growth and therefore may be a promising approach to suppress ovarian cancer cell growth. MEK1/2 inhibition promotes stem-like properties, thus suggesting a possible mechanism of resistance and that a combination with CSC-targeting drugs should be considered.",

    "abstract": "The squirrel monkey (Saimiri collinsi), a Neotropical primate endemic to the Amazon in Brazil, is used as a biological model for reproductive research on the genus Saimiri. Although this animal is known to exhibit reproductive seasonality, nothing is known about the differences in its seminal quality, sperm protein composition, or sperm protein profile between the breeding (dry) and non-breeding (rainy) seasons. Thus, the aims of this study were to evaluate the quality of S. collinsi semen during the dry and rainy seasons and to describe the global sperm proteomics and expression variations in the sperm proteins during the two seasons. Aside from the pH, there was no difference in the seminal quality between the dry and rainy seasons. The study approach based on bottom-up proteomics allowed the identification of 2343 proteins present in the sperm samples throughout these two seasons. Of the 79 proteins that were differentially expressed between the two seasons, 39 proteins that were related to spermatogenesis, sperm motility, capacitation, fecundation, and defense systems against oxidative stress were upregulated in the dry season. Knowledge on the sperm proteins provides crucial information for elucidating the underlying mechanisms associated with sperm functionality. Thus, our results help to advance our understanding of the reproductive physiology of S. collinsi, providing valuable information for the improvement of protocols used in assisted reproduction techniques for the conservation of endangered Saimiri species.",

    "abstract": "The P16 (CDKN2Aink4a) gene is an endogenous CDK4/6 inhibitor. Palbociclib (PD0332991) is an anti-CDK4/6 chemical for cancer treatment. P16 is most frequently inactivated by copy number deletion and DNA methylation in cancers. It is well known that cancer cells with P16 deletion are more sensitive to palbociclib than those without. However, whether P16 methylation is related to palbociclib sensitivity is not known. By analyzing public pharmacogenomic datasets, we found that the IC50 of palbociclib in cancer cell lines (n=522) was positively correlated with both the P16 expression level and P16 gene copy number. Our experimental results further showed that cancer cell lines with P16 methylation were more sensitive to palbociclib than those without. To determine whether P16 methylation directly increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to palbociclib, we induced P16 methylation in the lung cancer cell lines H661 and HCC827 and the gastric cancer cell line BGC823 via an engineered P16-specific DNA methyltransferase (P16-Dnmt) and found that the sensitivity of these cells to palbociclib was significantly increased. The survival rate of P16-Dnmt cells was significantly lower than that of vector control cells 48 hrs post treatment with palbociclib (10 M). Notably, palbociclib treatment also selectively inhibited the proliferation of the P16-methylated subpopulation of P16-Dnmt cells, further indicating that P16 methylation can increase the sensitivity of cells to this CDK4/6 inhibitor. These results were confirmed in an animal experiment. In conclusion, inactivation of the P16 gene by DNA methylation can increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to palbociclib.",

    "abstract": "Rice wild relatives (RWR) constitute an extended gene pool that can be tapped for the breeding of novel rice varieties adapted to abiotic stresses such as iron (Fe) toxicity. Therefore, we screened 75 Oryza genotypes including 16 domesticated O. sativas, one O. glaberrima, and 58 RWR representing 21 species, for tolerance to Fe toxicity. Plants were grown in a semi-artificial greenhouse setup, in which they were exposed either to control conditions, an Fe shock during the vegetative growth stage (acute treatment), or to a continuous moderately high Fe level (chronic treatment). In both stress treatments, foliar Fe concentrations were characteristic of Fe toxicity, and plants developed foliar stress symptoms, which were more pronounced in the chronic Fe stress especially toward the end of the growing season. Among the genotypes that produced seeds, only the chronic stress treatment significantly reduced yields due to increases in spikelet sterility. Moreover, a moderate but non-significant increase in grain Fe concentrations, and a significant increase in grain Zn concentrations were seen in chronic stress. Both domesticated rice and RWR exhibited substantial genotypic variation in their responses to Fe toxicity. Although no RWR strikingly outperformed domesticated rice in Fe toxic conditions, some genotypes scored highly in individual traits. Two O. meridionalis accessions were best in avoiding foliar symptom formation in acute Fe stress, while an O. rufipogon accession produced the highest grain yields in both chronic and acute Fe stress. In conclusion, this study provides the basis for using interspecific crosses for adapting rice to Fe toxicity.",

We demonstrate ontogenetic dichromatism in M. trinitatis by rearing post-metamorphic froglets to near maturity: the throats of all individuals started as grey coloured; at around seven weeks, the throat became pale yellow in some, and more strongly yellow as development proceeded; the throats of adults are grey in males and variably bright yellow in females, backed by a dark collar. We demonstrated the degree of throat colour variability by analysing a large sample of females. The red: green (R:G) ratio ranged from ~1.1 to 1.4, reflecting variation from yellow to yellow/orange, and there was also variation in the tone and width of the dark collar, and in the extent to which the yellow colouration occurred posterior to the collar. Female M. trinitatis are known to be territorial in behaviour. We show a positive relationship between throat colour (R:G ratio) and escape performance, as a proxy for quality. Our field observations on Tobagos M. olmonae showed variability in female throat colour and confirmed that males in this species also turn black when calling. Our literature review of the 20 Mannophryne species so far named showed that all females have yellow throats with dark collars, and that male colour change to black when calling has been reported in eight species; in the remaining 12 species, descriptions of males calling are usually lacking so far. We predict that both dynamic and ontogenetic sexual dichromatism are universal in this genus and provide discussion of the ecological role of dichromatism in this genus of predominantly diurnal, non-toxic frogs, with strong paternal care of offspring.",

    "abstract": "The immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment constitutes a significant hurdle to the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Both soluble factors and specialised immune cells such as regulatory T cells (TReg) are key components of active intratumoural immunosuppression. Previous studies have shown that Inducible Co-Stimulatory receptor (ICOS) is highly expressed in the tumour microenvironment, especially on TReg, suggesting that it represents a relevant target for preferential depletion of these cells. Here, we used immune profiling of samples from tumour bearing mice and cancer patients to characterise the expression of ICOS in different tissues and solid tumours. By immunizing an Icos knockout transgenic mouse line expressing antibodies with human variable domains, we selected a fully human IgG1 antibody called KY1044 that binds ICOS from different species. Using KY1044, we demonstrated that we can exploit the differential expression of ICOS on T cell subtypes to modify the tumour microenvironment and thereby improve the anti-tumour immune response. We showed that KY1044 induces sustained depletion of ICOShigh TReg cells in mouse tumours and depletion of ICOShigh T cells in the blood of non-human primates, but was also associated with secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from ICOSlow TEFF cells. Altogether, KY1044 improved the intratumoural TEFF:TReg ratio and increased activation of TEFF cells, resulting in monotherapy efficacy or in synergistic combinatorial efficacy when administered with the immune checkpoint blocker anti-PD-L1. In summary, our data demonstrate that targeting ICOS with KY1044 can favourably alter the intratumoural immune contexture, promoting an anti-tumour response.",

    "abstract": "Low-complexity protein domains promote the formation of various biomolecular condensates. However, in many cases, the precise sequence features governing condensate formation and identity remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of intrinsically disordered mixed-charge domains (MCDs) in nuclear speckle condensation. Proteins composed exclusively of arginine/aspartic-acid dipeptide repeats undergo length-dependent condensation and speckle incorporation. Substituting arginine with lysine in synthetic and natural speckle-associated MCDs abolishes these activities, identifying a key role for multivalent contacts through arginines guanidinium ion. MCDs can synergise with a speckle-associated RNA recognition motif to promote speckle specificity and residence. MCD behaviour is tuneable through net-charge: increasing negative charge abolishes condensation and speckle incorporation. By contrast, increasing positive charge through arginine leads to enhanced condensation, speckle enlargement, decreased splicing factor mobility, and defective mRNA export. Together, these results identify key sequence determinants of MCD-promoted speckle condensation, and link the speckles dynamic material properties with function in mRNA processing.",
