    "abstract": "Noncovalent adsorption of DNA on nanoparticles has led to their widespread implementation as gene delivery tools and optical probes. Yet, the behavior and stability of DNA-nanoparticle complexes once applied in biomolecule-rich, in vivo environments remains unpredictable, whereby biocompatibility testing usually occurs in serum. Here, we demonstrate time-resolved measurements of exchange dynamics between solution-phase and adsorbed corona-phase DNA and protein biomolecules on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We capture real-time binding of fluorophore-labeled biomolecules, utilizing the SWCNT surface as a fluorescence quencher, and apply this corona exchange assay to study protein corona dynamics on ssDNA-SWCNT-based dopamine sensors. We study exchange of two blood proteins, albumin and fibrinogen, adsorbing to and competitively displacing (GT)6 vs. (GT)15 ssDNA from ssDNA-SWCNTs. We find that (GT)15 binds to SWCNTs with a higher affinity than (GT)6 and that fibrinogen interacts with ssDNA-SWCNTs more strongly than albumin. Albumin and fibrinogen cause a 52.2% and 78.2% attenuation of the dopamine nanosensor response, coinciding with 0.5% and 3.7% desorption of (GT)6, respectively. Concurrently, the total surface-adsorbed fibrinogen mass is 168% greater than that of albumin. Binding profiles are fit to a competitive surface exchange model which recapitulates the experimental observation that fibrinogen has a higher affinity for SWCNTs than albumin, with a fibrinogen on-rate constant 1.61-fold greater and an off-rate constant 0.563-fold smaller than that of albumin. Our methodology presents a generic route to assess real-time corona exchange on nanoparticles in solution phase, and more broadly motivates testing of nanoparticle-based technologies in blood plasma rather than the more ubiquitously-tested serum conditions.",

    "abstract": "Whether hybridization generates or erodes species diversity has long been debated, but to date most studies have been conducted at small taxonomic scales. Salamanders (order Caudata) represent a taxonomic order in which hybridization plays a prevalent ecological and evolutionary role. We employed a recently developed model of trait-dependent diversification to test the hypothesis that hybridization impacts the diversification dynamics of species that are currently hybridizing. We find strong evidence supporting this hypothesis, showing that hybridizing salamander lineages have significantly greater net-diversification rates than non-hybridizing lineages. This pattern is driven by concurrently increased speciation rates and decreased extinction rates in hybridizing lineages. Our results support the hypothesis that hybridization can act as a generative force in macroevolutionary diversification.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial-driven alterations of the epigenome have been reported but whether they are relevant at the organismal level remain unknown. The viable yellow agouti mouse (Avy) is a powerful epigenetic biosensor model that reports on the DNA methylation status of the Avy locus through the coat color of the animals. Here we show that maternal exposure to rotenone, a potent mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, changes the DNA methylation status of the Avy locus and broadly affects the liver DNA methylome of the offspring. These effects were accompanied by altered gene expression programs that persisted throughout life. Mitochondrial dysfunction was present in the mothers but not in the offspring until 12 months of age, when electron transport and antioxidant defenses were impaired. These results highlight a putative novel role for mitochondria in nuclear epigenetic remodeling during development, raising fundamental questions about the long-term impact of mitochondrial dysfunction to health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Cardio-renal-metabolic (CaReMe) conditions are common and the leading cause of mortality around the world. Genome-wide association studies have shown that these diseases are polygenic and share many genetic risk factors. Identifying individuals at high genetic risk will allow us to target prevention and treatment strategies. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are aggregate weighted counts that can demonstrate an individuals genetic liability for disease. However, current PRS are often based on European ancestry individuals, limiting the implementation of precision medicine efforts in diverse populations. In this study, we develop PRS for six diseases and traits related to cardio-renal-metabolic disease in the Penn Medicine Biobank. We investigate their performance in both European and African ancestry individuals, and identify genetic and phenotypic overlap within these conditions. We find that genetic risk is associated with the primary phenotype in both ancestries, but this does not translate into a model of predictive value in African ancestry individuals. We conclude that future research should prioritize genetic studies in diverse ancestries in order to address this disparity.",

Autapses in neocortical layers have not been systematically investigated, and their function in different mammalian species and specific interneuron types is poorly known. We investigated GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (pvBCs) in layer 2/3 (L2/3) in mice as well as in human neocortical tissue resected in deep-brain surgery. Most pvBCs showed robust GABAAR-mediated self-innervation in both species, but autapses were rare in nonfast spiking GABAergic interneurons. Light- and electron microscopy analyses revealed pvBC axons innervating their own soma and proximal dendrites. GABAergic self-inhibition conductance was similar in human and mouse pvBCs and comparable to that of synapses from pvBCs to other L2/3 neurons. Autaptic conductance prolonged somatic inhibition in pvBCs after a spike and inhibited repetitive firing. Perisomatic autaptic inhibition has evolved in pvBCs of various cortical layers and different mammalian species to control discharge of these interneurons.",

    "abstract": "To date, it is still impossible to sample the entire mammalian brain with single-neuron precision. This forces one to either use spikes (focusing on few neurons) or to use coarse-sampled activity (averaging over many neurons, e.g. LFP). Naturally, the sampling technique impacts inference about collective properties. Here, we emulate both sampling techniques on a spiking model to quantify how they alter observed correlations and signatures of criticality. We discover a general effect: when the inter-electrode distance is small, electrodes sample overlapping regions in space, which increases the correlation between the signals. For coarse-sampled activity, this can produce power-law distributions even for non-critical systems. In contrast, spike recordings enable one to distinguish the underlying dynamics. This explains why coarse measures and spikes have produced contradicting results in the past - that are now all consistent with a slightly subcritical regime.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that adult hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) secrete a variety of proteins that affect tissue function. Though several individual NSPC-derived proteins have been shown to impact cellular processes like neuronal maturation and stem cell maintenance, a broad characterization of NSPC-secreted factors is lacking. Secretome profiling of low abundance stem cell populations is typically achieved via proteomic characterization of in vitro, isolated cells. Here, we analyzed the in vitro NSPC secretome using conditioned media from cultured adult mouse hippocampal NSPCs and detected over 200 different bioactive proteins with an antibody array. We next assessed the NSPC secretome on a transcriptional level with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of cultured NSPCs. This comparison revealed that quantification of gene expression did not accurately predict relative protein abundance for several factors. Furthermore, comparing our transcriptional data with previously published single cell RNA sequencing datasets of freshly isolated hippocampal NSPCs, we found key differences in gene expression of secreted proteins between cultured and acutely isolated NSPCs. Understanding the components and functions of the NSPC secretome is essential to understanding how these cells may modulate the hippocampal neurogenic niche, as well as how they can be applied therapeutically. Cumulatively, our data emphasize the importance of using proteomic analysis in conjunction with transcriptomic studies and highlights the need for better methods of global unbiased secretome profiling.",

    "abstract": "Tumor segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is a critical step in providing objective measures of predicting aggressiveness and response to therapy in gliomas. It has valuable applications in diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment planning of brain tumors. The purpose of this work was to develop a fully automated deep learning method for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction. Well curated brain tumor cases with multi-parametric MR Images from the BraTS2019 dataset were used. A three-group framework was implemented, with each group consisting of three 3D-Dense-UNets to segment whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC) and enhancing tumor (ET). This method was implemented to decompose the complex multi-class segmentation problem into individual binary segmentation problems for each sub-component. Each group was trained using different approaches and loss functions. The output segmentations of a particular label from their respective networks from the 3 groups were ensembled and post-processed. For survival analysis, a linear regression model based on imaging texture features and wavelet texture features extracted from each of the segmented components was implemented. The networks were tested on the BraTS2019 validation dataset including 125 cases for the brain tumor segmentation task and 29 cases for the survival prediction task. The segmentation networks achieved average dice scores of 0.901, 0.844 and 0.801 for WT, TC and ET respectively. The survival prediction network achieved an accuracy score of 0.55 and mean squared error (MSE) of 119244. This method could be implemented as a robust tool to assist clinicians in primary brain tumor management and follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Computational models of the musculoskeletal system are scientific tools used to study human movement, quantify the effects of injury and disease, and plan surgical interventions. Additionally, these models could also be used to intuitively link biological control signals and realistic high-dimensional articulated prosthetic limbs. However, implementing fast and accurate musculoskeletal computations that can be used to control a prosthetic limb in real-time is a challenging problem. As muscles typically span multiple joints, the wrapping over complex geometrical constraints changes their moment arms and length as a function of joint angle and, thus, their ability to generate joint torques. As a result of these biomechanical complexities, calculating these muscle state variables in real-time is a difficult simulation problem. Here, we report a method to accurately and efficiently calculate these variables for the forearm muscles that actuate the hand and wrist across multiple postures. The posture dependent muscle geometry, moment arms and lengths of modeled muscles, were captured using autogenerating polynomials that expanded their optimal selection of terms using information measurements. The iterative process approximated 33 musculotendon actuators, each spanning up to 6 DOFs in an 18 DOF model of the human arm and hand, defined over the full physiological range of motion. Using these polynomials, the entire forearm anatomy could be computed in <10 {micro}s, which is far better than what is required for real-time performance, and with low errors in moment arms (below 5%) and lengths (below 0.4%). Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of elements in these autogenerating polynomials does not increase exponentially with the increase in complexity of muscles, increasing linearly instead. The similar structure and function of muscles are represented with specific invariant polynomial terms. Dimensionality reduction using the polynomial terms alone resulted in clusters comprised of muscles with similar functions, suggesting that the polynomials themselves captured biologically relevant features of muscle structure and function. We propose that this novel method of describing musculoskeletal biomechanics might further improve the applications of detailed and scalable models for the description of human movement.",

Plants in the speciose genus Erysimum (Brassicaceae) produce both ancestral glucosinolates and evolutionarily novel cardenolides as defenses. Here we test macroevolutionary hypotheses on co-expression, co-regulation, and diversification of these potentially redundant defenses across this genus. We sequenced and assembled the genome of E. cheiranthoides and foliar transcriptomes of 47 additional Erysimum species to construct a highly resolved phylogeny, revealing that cardenolide diversity increased rapidly rather than gradually over evolutionary time. Concentrations, inducibility, and diversity of the two defenses varied independently among species, with no evidence for trade-offs. Closely related species shared similar cardenolide traits, but not glucosinolate traits, likely as a result of specific selective pressures acting on distinct molecular diversification mechanisms. Ancestral and novel chemical defenses in Erysimum thus appear to provide complementary rather than redundant functions.",

Although the rat is a widely used animal model for MI, there is a lack of material parameters based on anisotropic constitutive models for rat myocardial infarcts in literature. This study aimed at employing inverse methods to identify the parameters of an orthotropic constitutive model for myocardial infarcts in the acute, necrotic, fibrotic and remodelling phases utilizing the biaxial mechanical data developed in a previous study. FE model was developed mimicking the setup of the biaxial tensile experiment. The orthotropic case of the generalized Fung constitutive model was utilized to model the material properties of the infarct. The parameters of Fung model were optimized so that the FE solution best fitted the biaxial experimental stress-strain data. A genetic algorithm was used to minimize the objective function. Fung orthotropic material parameters for different infarct stages were identified. The FE model predictions best approximated the experimental data of the 28 days infarct stage with 3.0% mean absolute percentage error. The worst approximation was for the 7 days stage with 3.6% error. This study demonstrated that the experimental biaxial stress-strain data of healing rat infarcts could be successfully approximated using inverse FE methods and genetic algorithms.

    "abstract": "The cytochrome P450 family is composed of hemeproteins involved in the metabolic transformation of endogenous and exogenous substances. The CYP2D6 enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 25% of clinically used drugs and is mainly expressed in the liver. The CYP2D6 gene is known to have a large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and the majority of them do not present clinical consequences. Nevertheless, these variations could modify the CYP2D6 enzymes function, resulting in poor metabolizing or ultra-extensive metabolizing phenotypes, when metabolism is slower or accelerated, respectively. Currently, there are several computational tools for predicting functional changes caused by genetic variations. Here, using 20 web servers, we evaluated the impact of 21 missense SNPs (6 neutral and 15 deleterious) previously validated by the literature. Only seven predictors presented sensitivity higher than 70%, while four showed specificity higher than 70% and only one reached the Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.39. Combinations of tools with greater sensitivity and specificity were made to improve the Matthews correlation coefficient, which increased the coefficient of five tools (Provean, FatHMM, SDM, PoPMuSiC and HotMuSiC). The results suggest that the most appropriate tool for CYP2D6 SNP prediction is FATHMM, which could aid in the classification of novel missense SNPs in this gene, providing the identification of mutations potentially associated with drug metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The differential susceptibility hypothesis proposes that individuals who are more susceptible to the negative effects of adverse rearing conditions may also benefit more from enriched environments. Evidence derived from human experiments suggests the lower efficacy dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) 7-repeat as a main factor in exhibiting these for better and for worse characteristics. However, human studies lack the genetic and environmental control offered by animal experiments, complicating assessment of causal relations. To study differential susceptibility in an animal model, we exposed Drd4+/- mice and control litter mates to a limited nesting/bedding (LN), standard nesting (SN) or communal nesting (CN) rearing environment from postnatal day (P) 2-14. Puberty onset was examined from P24-P36 and adult females were assessed on maternal care towards their own offspring. In both males and females, LN reared mice showed a delay in puberty onset that was partly mediated by a reduction in body weight at weaning, irrespective of Drd4 genotype. During adulthood, LN reared females exhibited characteristics of poor maternal care, whereas dams reared in CN environments showed lower rates of unpredictability towards their own offspring. Differential susceptibility was observed only for licking/grooming levels of female offspring towards their litter; LN reared Drd4+/- mice exhibited the lowest and CN reared Drd4+/- mice the highest levels of licking/grooming. These results indicate that both genetic and early-environmental factors play an important role in shaping maternal care of the offspring for better and for worse.",

    "abstract": "Flower colour polymorphism (FCP) is frequently associated with differences in pollinator attraction. FCP maintenance is intriguing, as positive directional selection by pollinators should result in the loss of polymorphism. Autonomous selfing could confer reproductive assurance when pollen is limited, and could be a mechanism for maintaining polymorphism unless inbreeding depression is high. We study the role of selfing in maintaining FCP in Lysimachia arvensis, a species with blue and red morphs co-occurring in Mediterranean populations, where pollinators negatively select for the red morph. We experimentally assessed inbreeding depression in both morphs in two Mediterranean populations and genetic diversity was studied via AFLP and SSR microsatellites in 20 populations. Between-morph genetic differentiation was high and the red morph had a lower genetic diversity, mainly in the Mediterranean. Results also show strong phenological differences between selfed and outcrossed progeny, and a high ID of the red morph. The low genetic diversity of the red morph is in concordance with a reproductive system based predominantly on selfing. However, ID suggests a limited capacity for red morph recruitment, according to its low frequency in polymorphic populations. Genetic differentiation between morphs indicates a low gene flow between them, opening the possibility of reproductive isolation and speciation in Lysimachia arvensis.",

ELISPOT assays, as a powerful experimental technique, can verify the existence of antigen specific T cells to support basic clinical research and monitor clinical trials. However, despite the high sensitivity of ELISPOT assays, detecting immune responses of neoantigen specific T cells in a patient or healthy donors PBMCs is still extremely difficult, since the frequency of these T cells can be very low. We developed a novel experimental method, by co-stimulation of T cells with anti-CD28 and IL-2 at the beginning of ELISPOT, to further increase the sensitivity of ELISPOT and mitigate the challenge introduced by low frequency T cells. Under the optimal concentration of 1g/mL for anti-CD28 and 1U/ml for IL-2, our new method can increase sensitivity by up to 5 folds comparing to a conventional ELISPOT, and outperforms other cytokine stimulation alternatives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that the co-stimulation of anti-CD28 and IL-2 is able to significantly improve the sensitivity of ELISPOT assays, indicating that anti-CD28 and IL-2 signaling can act in synergy to lower the T cell activation threshold and trigger more neoantigen-specific T cells.",

    "abstract": "Drought is responsible for almost 70% of total crop damage in tropical and subtropical countries. In the Colombian Caribbean, drought has caused low availability of Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) in forage amount and quality, generating increase in production costs in livestock systems. In this study, we aimed at designing and evaluating dry macro-polymeric inoculants of Bacillus strains and used them successfully to mitigate drought effect on Guinea grass (M. maximus). We chose Bacillus sp XT13 and Bacillus megaterium XT14 strains, previously selected for their capacity to mitigate drought stress on Guinea grass. For the inoculant formulation process, a concentration of 3.2% alginate was used for both microorganisms, selecting the polymer-bacterium ratio of 70:30 for XT13 and 80:20 for XT14. The results of the experiments in greenhouse showed that drought had a negative effect on Guinea grass growth, but the PGPB application with or without macro-polymeric dry matrix improved plant growth significantly. We also observed that co-inoculation of the strains generated a greater beneficial effect than individual inoculation. Interestingly, co-inoculation of XT13 and XT14 under the dry macro-polymeric formulation increased biomass production of the aerial part (7.32%), root biomass, (25.3%), nutritional quality parameters, such as digestibility (3.32%), protein (20.3%); proline accumulation increased (21.06%) and both neutral digestible fiber (2.43%) and APX antioxidant activity (24.2%) decreased with respect to co-inoculation of both bacteria without formulation. These findings have shown that dry macrobeads immobilization has a significantly positive influence on the capacity of XT13 and XT14 bacterial strains to induce drought stress tolerance in Guinea grass.",

    "abstract": "Medium chain esters are potential drop-in biofuels and versatile chemicals. Currently, these esters are largely produced by the conventional chemical process that uses harsh operating conditions and requires high energy input. Alternatively, the microbial conversion route has recently emerged as a promising platform for sustainable and renewable ester production. The ester biosynthesis pathways can utilize either esterases/lipases or alcohol acyltransferase (AAT), but the AAT-dependent pathway is more thermodynamically favorable in aqueous fermentation environment. Even though cellulolytic thermophiles such as Clostridium thermocellum harboring the engineered AAT-dependent pathway can directly convert lignocellulosic biomass into esters, the production is currently not efficient and requires optimization. One potential bottleneck is the ester degradation caused by the endogenous carbohydrate esterases (CEs) whose functional roles are poorly understood. In this study, we developed a simple, high-throughput colorimetric assay to screen the endogenous esterases of C. thermocellum responsible for ester hydrolysis. We identified, characterized, and disrupted two critical endogenous esterases that significantly contributes to isobutyl acetate degradation in C. thermocellum. We demonstrated that not only did the engineered esterase-deficient strain alleviate ester hydrolysis but also helped improve isobutyl acetate production while not affecting its robust metabolism for effective cellulose assimilation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCECarbohydrate esterases (CEs) are important enzymes in the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass by the cellulolytic thermophile C. thermocellum, yet some are potential ester degraders in a microbial ester production system. Currently, the functional roles of CEs for hydrolyzing medium chain esters and negatively affecting the ester microbial biosynthesis are not well understood. This study discovered novel CEs responsible for isobutyl acetate degradation in C. thermocellum and hence identified one of the critical bottlenecks for direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into esters.",

    "abstract": "Across many studies, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity has been found to correlate with subjective value during value-based decision-making. Recently, however, vmPFC has also been shown to reflect a hexagonal gridlike code during navigation through physical and conceptual space. This raises the possibility that the subjective value correlates previously observed in vmPFC may have actually been a misconstrued gridlike signal. Here, we first show that, in theory, a hexagonal gridlike code of two-dimensional attribute space could mimic vmPFC activity previously attributed to subjective value. However, using fMRI data from a large number of subjects performing an intertemporal choice task, we show clear and unambiguous evidence that subjective value is a better description of vmPFC activity than a hexagonal gridlike code. In fact, we find no significant evidence at all for a hexagonal gridlike code in vmPFC activity during intertemporal choice. This result limits the generality of gridlike modulation as description of vmPFC activity. We suggest that vmPFC may flexibly switch representational schemes so as to encode the most relevant information for the current task.",

    "abstract": "How does information from seconds earlier affect neocortical responses to new input? Here, we used empirical measurements and computational modeling to study the integration and forgetting of prior information. We found that when two groups of participants heard the same sentence in a narrative, preceded by different contexts, the neural responses of each group were initially different, but gradually fell into alignment. We observed a hierarchical gradient: sensory cortices aligned most quickly, followed by mid-level regions, while higher-order cortical regions aligned last. In some higher order regions, responses to the same sentence took more than 10 seconds to align. What kinds of computations can explain this hierarchical organization of contextual alignment? Passive linear integration models predict that regions which are slower to integrate new information should also be slower to forget old information. However, we found that higher order regions could rapidly forget prior context. The data were better captured by a model composed of hierarchical autoencoders in time (HAT). In HAT, cortical regions maintain a temporal context representation which is actively integrated with input at each moment, and this integration is gated by prediction error. These data and models suggest that sequences of information are combined throughout the cortical hierarchy using an active and gated integration process.",

    "abstract": "Early events occurring at the surface of the female organ are critical for plant reproduction, especially in species with a dry stigma. Following landing on the stigmatic papilla cells, the pollen hydrates and germinates a tube, which penetrates the cell wall and grows towards the ovules to convey the male gametes to the embryo sac. In self-incompatible (SI) species within the Brassicaceae, these processes are blocked when the stigma encounters an incompatible pollen. Here, based on the generation of SI-Arabidopsis lines and by setting up a live imaging system, we showed that control of pollen hydration has a central role in pollen selectivity. The faster pollen pumps water from the papilla during an initial period of 10 minutes, the faster it germinates. Furthermore, we found that the SI barriers act to block the proper hydration of incompatible pollen and when hydration is promoted by high humidity, an additional control prevents pollen tube penetration into the stigmatic wall. In papilla cells, actin bundles focalize at the contact site with the compatible pollen but not with the incompatible one, raising the possibility that stigmatic cells react to the mechanical pressure applied by the invading growing tube.\n\nHighlightA live imaging system coupled with self-incompatible Arabidopsis lines highlight the role of stigmatic cells in controlling pollen hydration and in reacting to pollen tube intrusion by remodeling actin cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "We developed coupled Nose-Hoover (NH) molecular dynamics equations of motion (EOM), wherein the heat-bath temperature for the physical system (PS) fluctuates according to an arbitrary predetermined weight. The coupled NH is defined by suitably jointing the NH EOM of the PS and the NH EOM of the temperature system (TS), where the inverse heat-bath temperature {beta} is a dynamical variable. In this study, we define a method to determine the effective weight for enhanced sampling of the PS states. The method, based on ergodic theory, is reliable, and eliminates the need for time-consuming iterative procedures and resource-consuming replica systems. The resulting TS potential in a two dimensional ({beta}, {epsilon})-space forms a valley, and the potential minimum path forms a river flowing through the valley. {beta} oscillates around the potential minima for each energy{epsilon} , and the motion of {beta} derives a motion of{epsilon} and receives the{epsilon} s feedback, which leads to a mutual boost effect. Thus, it also provides a specific dynamical mechanism to explain the features of enhanced sampling such that the temperature-space \\\"random walk\\\" enhances the energy-space \\\"random walk.\\\" Surprisingly, these mutual dynamics between {beta} and{epsilon} naturally arise from the static probability theory formalism of double density dynamics that was previously developed, where the Liouville equation with an arbitrarily given probability density function is the fundamental polestar. Numerical examples using a model system and an explicitly solvated protein system verify the reliability, simplicity, and superiority of the method.",

    "abstract": "Population density affects fitness through various processes, such as mate finding and competition. The fitness of individuals in a population can in turn affect its density, making population density a key quantity linking ecological and evolutionary processes. Density effects are, however, rarely homogeneous. Different life-history processes can be affected by density over different spatial scales. In birds, for example, competition for food may depend on the number of birds nesting in the direct vicinity, while competition for nesting sites may occur over larger areas. Here we investigate how the effects of local density and of density in nearby patches can jointly affect the emergence of spatial variation in abundance as well as phenotypic diversification. We study a two-patch model that is described by coupled ordinary differential equations. The patches have no intrinsic differences: they both have the same fitness function that describes how an individuals fitness depends on density in its own patch as well as the density in the other patch. We use a phase-space analysis, combined with a mathematical stability analysis to study the long-term behaviour of the system. Our results reveal that the mutual effect that the patches have on each other can lead to the emergence and long-term maintenance of a low and a high density patch. We then add traits and mutations to the model and show that different selection pressures in the high and low density patch can lead to diversification between these patches. Via eco-evolutionary feedbacks, this diversification can in turn lead to changes in the long-term population densities: under some parameter settings, both patches reach the same equilibrium density when mutations are absent, but different equilibrium densities when mutations are allowed. We thus show how, even in the absence of differences between patches, interactions between them can lead to differences in long-term population density, and potentially to trait diversification.",

Using dual effectors capable of re-writing enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, we show that enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi modulate gene transcription by remodeling local epigenetic landscapes at sgRNA-targeted enhancers and associated genes. Comparing with existing methods, the new systems display more robust perturbation of enhancer activity and gene transcription with minimal off-targets. Allele-specific targeting of enCRISPRa to oncogenic TAL1 super-enhancer modulates TAL1 expression and cancer progression in xenotransplants. Multiplexed perturbations of lineage-specific enhancers using an enCRISPRi knock-in mouse establish in vivo evidence for lineage-restricted essentiality of developmental enhancers during hematopoietic lineage specification. Hence, enhanced CRSIPR epigenetic editing provides opportunities for interrogating enhancer function in native biological contexts.",

When we stimulated inferior frontal brain regions, with 6 Hz alternating currents being in-phase between the instructor and the learner, the dyad exhibited spontaneous and synchronized body movement. Remarkably, this stimulation also led to enhanced learning performance. A mediation analysis further disclosed that interpersonal movement synchrony acted as a partial mediator of the effect of dual brain stimulation on learning performance, i.e. possibly facilitating the effect of dual brain stimulation on learning. Our results provide a causal demonstration that inter-brain synchrony is a sufficient condition to improve real-time information transfer between pairs of individuals.\\n\\nSignificanceThe study of social behavior, including but not limited to social learning, is undergoing a paradigm shift moving from single- to multi-person brain research. Yet, nearly all evidence in this area is purely correlational: inter-dependencies between brains signals are used to predict success in social behavior. For instance, inter-brain synchrony has been shown to be associated with successful communication, cooperation, and joint attention. Here we took a radically different approach. We stimulated two brains simultaneously, hence manipulating inter-brain synchrony, and measured the resulting effect upon behavior in the context of a social learning task. We report that frequency- and phase-specific dual brain stimulation can lead to the emergence of spontaneous synchronized body movement between an instructor and a learner. Remarkably, this can also augment learning performance.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacokinetic characterization of a drug, especially the determination of its biological half-life, is an essential step during the early phases of drug development. An adequate half-life is amongst the many properties needed for selecting a drug candidate for clinical trials. Conversely, drug candidates possessing inadequate half-lives may be modified or eliminated from the drug discovery pipeline altogether. Several methods exist for determining the half-lives of drugs, namely HPLC, fluorescence assays, radioassays, radioimmunoassays, and elemental mass spectrometric assays. However, all these techniques are resource and labor-intensive, and cannot be used for the high-throughput half-life determination of hundreds of drug candidates. Here, we describe TOXHL: a simple technique to determine the half-lives of compounds displaying noncumulative toxicity. To calculate the half life, TOXHL only relies on the survival outcomes of three experiments performed on an animal model: an acute toxicity experiment, a cumulative toxicity experiment, and a multi-dose experiment at different dosing intervals. As a proof of concept, we use TOXHL to determine the peritoneal half-life of {Omega}76, an antimicrobial peptide. The half-life of {Omega}76 determined by TOXHL is in good agreement with results from a standard mass spectrometric method, validating this approach.",

However, it is unclear what fundamental biochemical principles underlie this complex response system. By studying the minimal system in Marchantia polymorpha, we derive an intuitive and simple model where a single auxin-dependent A-ARF activates gene expression. It is antagonized by an auxin-independent B-ARF that represses common target genes.

The method has a well-developed theoretical foundation and corresponding mathematical models that describe the CSF circulation from the choroid plexus to the arachnoid granulations. Here, we investigate to what extent the proposed glymphatic or paravascular pathway (or similar pathways) modifies the results of the traditional mathematical models.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a two-compartment model consisting of the subarachnoid space and the paravascular spaces. For the arachnoid granulations, the cribriform plate, capillaries and paravascular spaces, resistances were calculated and used to estimate flow before and during an infusion test. Next, pressure in the subarachnoid space and paravascular spaces were computed. Finally, different variations to the model were tested to evaluate the sensitivity of selected parameters.\\n\\nResultsAt baseline, we found a very small paravascular flow directed into the subarachnoid space, while 60% of the fluid left through the arachnoid granulations and 40% left through the cribriform plate. However, during the infusion, paravascular flow reversed and 25% of the fluid left through these spaces, while 60% went through the arachnoid granulations and only 15% through the cribriform plate.\\n\\nConclusionsThe relative distribution of CSF flow to different clearance pathways depends on intracranial pressure (ICP), with the arachnoid granulations as the main contributor to outflow. As such, ICP increase is an important factor that should be addressed when determining the pathways of injected substances in the subarachnoid space.",

In summary, iLASH enables fast and accurate detection of IBD, an upstream step in applications of IBD for population genetics and trait mapping.",

While the apparent position of a stimulus is biased in the direction of motion, electro-physiological studies have shown that the receptive field (RF) of neurons is shifted in the direction opposite to motion, at least in cats and macaque monkeys. In humans, it remains unclear how motion signals affect population RF (pRF) estimates. We addressed this question using psychophysical measurements and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 7 Tesla. We systematically varied two factors: the motion direction of the carrier pattern (inward, outward and flicker motion) and the contrast of the mapping stimulus (low and high stimulus contrast). We observed that while physical positions were identical across all conditions, presence of low-contrast motion, but not high-contrast motion, shifted perceived stimulus position in the direction of motion. Correspondingly, we found that pRF estimates in early visual cortex were shifted against the direction of motion for low-contrast stimuli but not for high stimulus contrast. We offer an explanation in form of a model for why apertures are perceptually shifted in the direction of motion even though pRFs shift in the opposite direction.",

In this platform, each anatomic component of the OoC is described by an equation of motion that can be followed in time. We propose an initial set of models that attempt to capture the nonlinearities of somatic and bundle motility, but can nevertheless be easily handled. The anatomic components that we consider are the outer hair cells (OHCs), the outer hair cell bundles, Deiters cells, Hensen cells, the IHB and various sections of the reticular lamina. We study endolymph fluid motion in the subtectorial gap and then the mutual interactions among the components of the OoC, including the pressure exerted by endolymph. Minute bending of the apical ends of the OHCs can have a significant impact on the passage of motion from the BM to the IHB, including possible critical oscillator behaviour, even without the assistance of tectorial motion, shearing, or bundle motility. Thus, the components of the OoC could cooperate to enhance frequency selectivity, amplitude compression and signal to noise ratio in the passage from the BM to the IHB. Our models also provide a mechanism that could contribute to appropriate amplification of the wave travelling along the cochlea.",

To elucidate the mechanisms that landfill microbial communities perform to attack recalcitrant PU plastic, we studied the BP8 community selected by its capability to grow in a water PU dispersion (WPUD) that contains a polyether-polyurethane-acrylate (PE-PU-A) copolymer and xenobiotic additives (N-methyl 2-pyrrolidone, isopropanol and glycol ethers), and performed a proximity ligation-based metagenomic analysis for revealing the community structure and potential biodegradative capacity. Additives were consumed early whereas the copolymer was cleaved throughout the 25-days incubation. BP8 metagenomic deconvolution reconstructed five genomes, three of them from novel species. Genes encoding enzymes for additives biodegradation were predicted. The chemical and physical analysis of the biodegradation process, and the identified biodegradation products show that BP8 cleaves esters, aromatic urethanes, C-C and ether groups by hydrolytic and oxidative mechanisms. The metagenomic analysis allowed to predicting comprehensive metabolic pathways and enzymes that explain the observed PU biodegradation. This is the first study revealing the metabolic potential of a landfill microbial community that thrives within a WPUD system and shows potential for bioremediation of polyurethane- and xenobiotic additives-contaminated sites.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesEpidemiological studies indicate that first- and second-hand cigarette smoke (CS) exposure are important risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Additionally, elevated diabetes risk has been reported to occur within a short period of time after smoking cessation, and health risks associated with smoking are increased when combined with obesity. At present, the mechanisms underlying these associations remain incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to test the impact of CS exposure on pancreatic {beta}-cell function using rodent and in vitro models.\\n\\nMethodsBeginning at 8 weeks of age, C57BL/6J mice were concurrently fed high fat-diet (HFD) and exposed to CS for 11 weeks, followed by an additional 11 weeks of smoking cessation with continued HFD exposure. Glucose tolerance testing was performed during CS exposure and during the cessation period. Cultured {beta}-cells (INS-1) and primary islets were exposed ex vivo to CS extract (CSE), and {beta}-cell function and viability were tested. Since CS increases ceramide in lungs cells and these bioactive sphingolipids have been implicated in pancreatic {beta}-cell dysfunction in diabetes, islet and {beta}-cell sphingolipid levels were measured in islets from CS-exposed mice and in CSE-treated islets and INS-1 cells using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\\n\\nResultsCompared to HFD-fed ambient air-exposed mice, HFD-fed and CS- exposed mice had reduced weight gain and better glucose tolerance during the active smoking period. Following smoking cessation, CS-mice exhibited rapid weight gain and a significantly greater increase in glucose intolerance compared to non-smoking control mice. CS-exposed mice had higher serum proinsulin/insulin ratios, indicative of {beta}-cell dysfunction, significantly lower {beta}-cell mass (p=0.02), and reduced {beta}-cell proliferation (p=0.006), and increased islet ceramide accumulation. Ex vivo exposure of isolated islets to CSE was sufficient to increase islet ceramide accumulation, reduce insulin gene expression and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and increase {beta}-cell oxidative and ER stress. Treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, markedly attenuated the effects of CSE on ceramide levels, restored {beta}-cell function and survival, and increased cyclin D2 expression, while also reducing activation of {beta}-cell ER and oxidative stress.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results indicate that CS exposure inhibits insulin production, processing, and secretion and reduced {beta}-cell viability and proliferation. These effects were linked to increased {beta}-cell oxidative and ER stress and ceramide accumulation. Mice fed HFD continued to experience detrimental effects of CS exposure even during smoking cessation. Elucidation of mechanisms by which CS exposure impairs {beta}-cell function in synergy with obesity will help design therapeutic and preventive interventions for both active and former smokers.",

    "abstract": "Judging poses, sizes and shapes of objects accurately is necessary for organisms and machines to operate successfully in the world. Retinal images of 3D objects are mapped by the rules of projective geometry, and preserve the invariants of that geometry. Since Plato, it has been debated whether geometry is innate to the human brain, and Poincare and Einstein thought it worth examining whether formal geometry arises from experience with the world. We examine if humans have learned to exploit projective geometry to estimate sizes and shapes of objects in 3D scenes.\\n\\nNumerous studies have examined size invariance as a function of physical distance, which changes scale on the retina, but surprisingly, possible constancy or inconstancy of relative size seems not to have been investigated for object pose, which changes retinal image size differently along different axes. We show systematic underestimation of length for extents pointing towards or away from the observer, both for static objects and dynamically rotating objects. Observers do correct for projected shortening according to the optimal back-transform, obtained by inverting the projection function, but the correction is inadequate by a multiplicative factor. The clue is provided by the greater underestimation for longer objects, and the observation that they appear more slanted towards the observer. Adding a multiplicative factor for perceived slant in the back-transform model provides good fits to the corrections used by observers. We quantify the slant illusion with relative slant measurements, and use a dynamic demonstration to show the power of the slant illusion.\\n\\nIn biological and mechanical objects, distortions of shape are manifold, and changes in aspect ratio and relative limb sizes are functionally important. Our model shows that observers try to retain invariance of these aspects of shape to 3D rotation by correcting retinal image distortions due to perspective projection, but the corrections can fall short. We discuss how these results imply that humans have internalized particular aspects of projective geometry through evolution or learning, and how assuming that images are preserving the continuity, collinearity, and convergence invariances of projective geometry, supplements the Generic Viewpoint assumption, and simply explains other illusions, such as Ames Chair.",

    "abstract": "Experiments on tumor spheroids have shown that compressive stress from their environment can reversibly decrease tumor expansion rates and final sizes. Stress release experiments show that nonuniform anisotropic elastic stresses can be distributed throughout. The elastic stresses are maintained by structural proteins and adhesive molecules, and can be actively relaxed by a variety of biophysical processes. In this paper, we present a new continuum model to investigate how the growth-induced elastic stresses and active stress relaxation, in conjunction with cell size control feedback machinery, regulate the cell density and stress distributions within growing tumors as well as the tumor sizes in the presence of external physical confinement and gradients of growth-promoting chemical fields. We introduce an adaptive reference map that relates the current position with the reference position but adapts to the current position in the Eulerian frame (lab coordinates) via relaxation. This type of stress relaxation is similar to but simpler than the classical Maxwell model of viscoelasticity in its formulation. By fitting the model to experimental data from two independent studies of tumor spheroid growth and their cell density distributions, treating the tumors as incompressible, neo-Hookean elastic materials, we find that the rates of stress relaxation of tumor tissues can be comparable to volumetric growth rates. Our study provides insight on how the biophysical properties of the tumor and host microenvironment, mechanical feedback control and diffusion-limited differential growth act in concert to regulate spatial patterns of stress and growth. When the tumor is stiffer than the host, our model predicts tumors are more able to change their size and mechanical state autonomously, which may help to explain why increased tumor stiffness is an established hallmark of malignant tumors.\n\nAuthor summaryThe mechanical state of cells can modulate their growth and division dynamics via mechanotransduction, which affects both the cell size distribution and the tissue size as a whole. Experiments on tumor spheroids have shown that compressive stress from their environment can reversibly decrease tumor expansion rates and final sizes. Besides external confinement and compression on the tumor border, a heterogeneous stress field can be generated inside the tumor by nutrient-driven differential growth. Such growth-induced mechanical stresses can be relaxed by tissue rearrangement, which happens during cell neighbor exchanges, cell divisions, and extracellular matrix renewal. In this study, we have developed a continuum model that describes the above mechanical interactions and the dynamics of tissue rearrangement explicitly. Motivated by published experimental data, we consider mechanotransduction where the local compressive stress slows down cell growth and cell size reduction limits cell division. We have analyzed how external mechanical stimuli and internal processes influence the outcome of cell-and-tissue sizes and spatial patterns of cell density and mechanical stress in growing tumors.",

    "abstract": "The distributions of human malaria parasite species overlap in most malarious regions of the world, and co-infections involving two or more malaria parasite species are common. Little is known about the consequences of interactions between species during co-infection for disease severity and parasite transmission success. Anti-malarial interventions can have disproportionate effects on malaria parasite species, and may locally differentially reduce the number of species in circulation. Thus, it is important to have a clearer understanding of how the interactions between species affect disease and transmission dynamics. Controlled competition experiments using human malaria parasites are impossible, and thus we assessed the consequences of mixed-species infections on parasite fitness, disease severity, and transmission success using the rodent malaria parasite species Plasmodium chabaudi, P. yoelii yoelii, and P. vinckei lentum. We compared the fitness of individual species within single species and co-infections in mice. We also assessed the disease severity of single versus mixed infections in mice by measuring mortality rates, anaemia, and weight loss. Finally, we compared the transmission success of parasites in single or mixed species infections by quantifying oocyst development in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. We found that co-infections of P. yoelii with either P. vinckei or P. chabaudi led to a dramatic increase in infection virulence, with 100% mortality observed in mixed species infections, compared to no mortality for P. yoelii and P. vinckei single infections, and 40% mortality for P. chabaudi single infections. The increased mortality in the mixed infections was associated with an inability to clear parasitaemia, with the non-P. yoelii parasite species persisting at higher parasite densities than in single infections. P. yoelii growth was suppressed in all mixed infections compared to single infections. Transmissibility of P. vinckei and P. chabaudi to mosquitoes was also reduced in the presence of P. yoelii in co-infections compared to single infections. The increased virulence of co-infections containing P. yoelii (reticulocyte restricted) and P. chabaudi or P. vinckei (predominantly normocyte restricted) may be due to parasite cell tropism and/or immune modulation of the host. We explain the reduction in transmission success of species in co-infections in terms of inter-species gamete incompatibility.",

    "abstract": "Enriched tumor epithelium, tumor-associated stroma, and whole tissue were collected by laser microdissection from thin sections across spatially separated levels of ten primary high-grade serous ovarian tumors and analyzed using proteomics (mass spectrometry and reverse phase protein microarray) and RNA-sequencing analyses. Comparative analyses of transcript and protein abundances revealed independent clustering of enriched stroma and enriched tumor epithelium, with whole tumor tissue clustering between purified collections, driven by overall tumor purity. Comparison of historic prognostic molecular subtypes for HGSOC revealed protein and transcript expression from tumor epithelium correlated most strongly with the differentiated molecular subtype, whereas stromal proteins and transcripts most strongly correlated with mesenchymal subtype. Protein and transcript abundance in tumor epithelium and stromal collections from neighboring sections exhibited decreased correlation in samples collected just hundreds of microns apart. These data reveal substantial protein and transcript expression heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment that directly bears on prognostic signatures and underscore the need to enrich cellular subpopulations for expression profiling.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen rapid advances in directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to kidney cells. However, a fundamental difficulty in emulating kidney tissue formation is that kidney development is iterative. Recent studies argue that the human nephron forms through gradual contribution of nephron progenitor cells whose differentiation fates depend on the time at which they are recruited. We show that the majority of PSC-derived nephron progenitor cells differentiated in a short wave in organoid formation and to improve fidelity of PSC-derived organoids, we emulated the asynchronous mix found in the fetal kidney by combining cells differentiated at different times in the same organoid. Asynchronous mixing promoted nephrogenesis, and lineage marking data showed that proximal and distal nephron components preferentially derive from cell populations differentiated at distinct times. When engrafted under the kidney capsule these heterochronic organoids were vascularized and displayed essential features of kidney tissue. Micro-CT and injection of a circulating vascular marker demonstrated that engrafted kidney tissue was connected to the systemic circulation by 2 weeks after engraftment. Proximal tubule glucose uptake was confirmed using intravenous injection of fluorescent dextran. Despite these promising measures of graft function, overgrowth of stromal cells prevented long-term study, and we propose that this is a technical feature of the engraftment procedure rather than a specific shortcoming of the directed differentiation because kidney organoids derived from primary cells and whole embryonic kidneys develop the same stromal overgrowth when engrafted under the kidney capsule.",

    "abstract": "Environmental changes caused by urbanization and noise pollution can have profound effects on acoustic communication. Many organisms use higher sound frequencies in urban environments with low-frequency noise, but the developmental and evolutionary mechanisms underlying these shifts are less clear. We used a common garden experiment to ask whether changes in minimum song frequency observed 30 years after a songbird colonized an urban environment are a consequence of behavioral flexibility or canalized changes that occur early in development. We captured male juvenile dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis thurberi) from two recently diverged populations (urban and mountain) soon after they reached independence (aged 25-40 days), raised them in identical indoor aviaries, and studied their songs at an age of three years. We found that the large population difference in minimum frequency observed in the field persisted undiminished in the common garden despite the absence of noise. We also found some song sharing between the common garden and natal field populations, indicating that early song memorization before capture could contribute to the persistent song differences in adulthood. These results are the first to show that frequency shifts in urban birdsong are maintained in the absence of noise by genetic evolution and/or early life experiences.",

Transmission chains for tuberculosis are notoriously difficult to ascertain, but mathematical modelling approaches, combined with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, have strong potential to contribute to transmission analyses. Using such data, we aimed to reconstruct transmission histories for the outbreak using a Bayesian approach, and to use machine learning techniques with patient-level data to identify the key covariates associated with transmission. By using our transmission reconstruction method that accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty, we are able to identify 24 transmission events with reasonable confidence, 11 of which have zero single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distance, and as maximum distance of 3. Patient age, alcohol abuse and history of homelessness were found to be the most important predictors of being credible tuberculosis transmitters.",

    "abstract": "Microstates reflect transient brain states resulting from the activity of synchronously active brain networks that predominate in the broadband EEG time series. Despite increasing interest in understanding how the functional organization of the brain varies across individuals, or the extent to which its spatiotemporal dynamics are state dependent, comparatively little research has examined within and between-person correlates of microstate temporal parameters in healthy populations. In the present study, neuroelectric activity recorded during eyes-closed rest and during simple visual fixation was segmented into a time series of transient microstate intervals. It was found that five data-driven microstate configurations explained the preponderance of topographic variance in the EEG time series of the 374 recordings (from 187 participants) included in the study. We observed that the temporal dynamics of microstates varied within individuals to a greater degree than they differed between persons, with within-person factors explaining a large portion of the variance in mean microstate duration and occurrence rate. Nevertheless, several individual differences were found to predict the temporal dynamics of microstates. Of these, age and gender were the most reliable. These findings suggest that not only do the rich temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks vary considerably within-individuals, but that microstates appear to differentiate persons based on trait individual differences. The current findings suggest that rather than focusing exclusively on between-person differences in microstates as measures of brain function, researchers should turn their attention towards understanding the factors contributing to within-person variation.",

The microRNA-210 (miR-210) is a highly-conserved, hypoxia-regulated miRNA that has been shown to be dysregulated in Alzheimers Disease. We have recently also identified a significant enrichment of neurodegenerative diseases among miR-210 targets within the human transcriptome. To further elucidate the role of miR-210 in neuronal function and cognitive behaviour, we utilised conditional miR-210 knockout mice to characterise miR-210 regulation and function in primary hippocampal neurons and measured visual discrimination and reversal learning using rodent touchscreen assays. We found that miR-210 expression was induced by neuronal activation and loss of neuronal miR-210 increased oxidative metabolism and ROS production as well as dendritic density and branching in vitro. We also found that loss of miR-210 in knockout mice increased behavioural flexibility and reduced perseverative responding during reversal learning which required updating of information and feedback. These data support a conserved, activity-dependent role for miR-210 in cognitive function through modulation of neuronal metabolism.",

Microbial sRNAs have been primarily investigated in a few model organisms and little is known about the dynamics of sRNA synthesis in natural environments, and the roles of these short transcripts at the community level. Analyzing the metatranscriptome of a model extremophilic community inhabiting halite nodules (salt rocks) from the Atacama Desert with SnapT - a new sRNA annotation pipeline - we discovered hundreds of intergenic (itsRNAs) and antisense (asRNAs) sRNAs. The halite sRNAs were taxonomically diverse with the majority expressed by members of the Halobacteria. We found asRNAs with expression levels negatively correlated with that of their putative overlapping target, suggesting a potential gene regulatory mechanism. A number of itsRNAs were conserved and significantly differentially expressed (FDR<5%) between 2 sampling time points allowing for stable secondary structure modeling and target prediction. This work demonstrates that metatranscriptomic field experiments link environmental variation with changes in RNA pools and have the potential to provide new insights into environmental sensing and responses in natural microbial communities through non-coding RNA mediated gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Chitin is an abundant polysaccharide used by a large range of organisms for structural rigidity and water repulsion. As such, the insoluble crystalline structure of chitin poses significant challenges for enzymatic degradation. Vertebrates do not produce chitin, but do express chitin degrading enzymes. Acidic mammalian chitinase, the primary enzyme involved in the degradation of environmental chitin in mammalian lungs, is a processive glycosyl hydrolase that may be able to make multiple hydrolysis events for each binding event. Mutations to acidic mammalian chitinase have been associated with asthma, and genetic deletion of the enzyme in mice results in significantly increased morbidity and mortality with age. We initially set out to reverse this phenotype by engineering hyperactive acidic mammalian chitinase variants. Using a directed evolution screening approach using commercial fluorogenic substrates, we identified mutations with consistent increases in activity. To determine whether the activity increases observed with oligomeric substrates were consistent with more biologically relevant chitin substrates, we developed new assays to quantify chitinase activity with colloidal crystalline chitin, and identified a high throughput fluorogenic assay that gives sufficient signal to noise advantages to quantify changes to activity due to the addition or removal of a chitin binding domain to the enzyme. We show that the activity increasing mutations derived from our directed evolution screen were lost when crystalline substrates were used. In contrast, naturally occurring gain-of-function mutations gave similar results with oligomeric and crystalline substrates. We also show that the activity differences between acidic mammalian chitinase and chitotriosidase are reduced in the context of crystalline substrate, suggesting that previously reported activity differences with oligomeric substrates may have been largely driven by differential substrate specificity for the oligomers. These results highlight the need for assays against more physiological substrates when engineering complex metabolic enzymes, and provide a new approach that may be broadly applicable to engineering glycosyl hydrolases.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable evolutionary capacity of cancer is a major challenge to current therapeutic efforts. Fueling this evolution is its vast clonal heterogeneity and ability to adapt to diverse selective pressures. Although the genetic and transcriptional mechanisms underlying these responses have been independently evaluated, the ability to couple genetic alterations present within individual clones to their respective transcriptional or functional outputs has been lacking in the field. To this end, we developed a high-complexity expressed barcode library that integrates DNA barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing through use of the CROP-seq sgRNA expression/capture system, and which is compatible with the COLBERT clonal isolation workflow for subsequent genomic and epigenomic characterization of specific clones of interest. We applied this approach to study chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a mature B cell malignancy notable for its genetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity and variable disease course. Here, we demonstrate the clonal composition and gene expression states of HG3, a CLL cell line harboring the common alteration del(13q), in response to front-line cytotoxic therapy of fludarabine and mafosfamide (an analog of the clinically used cyclophosphamide). Analysis of clonal abundance and clonally-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that only a small fraction of clones consistently survived therapy. These rare highly drug tolerant clones comprise 94% of the post-treatment population and share a stable, pre-existing gene expression state characterized by upregulation of CXCR4 and WNT signaling and a number of DNA damage and cell survival genes. Taken together, these data demonstrate at unprecedented resolution the diverse clonal characteristics and therapeutic responses of a heterogeneous cancer cell population. Further, this approach provides a template for the high-resolution study of thousands of clones and the respective gene expression states underlying their response to therapy.",

Emerging evidence suggests that cancer cells adapting by non-genetic mechanisms constitute a reservoir for the development of drug-resistant tumors. Here, we show that few hours after exposure to RAF/MEK inhibitors, BRAFV600E melanomas undergo adaptive changes involving disruption of negative feedback and sporadic pulsatile reactivation of the MAPK pathway, so that MAPK activity is transiently high enough in some cells to drive proliferation. Quantitative proteomics and computational modeling show that pulsatile MAPK reactivation is possible due to the co-existence in cells of two MAPK cascades: one driven by BRAFV600E that is drug-sensitive and a second driven by receptors that is drug-resistant. Paradoxically, this may account both for the frequent emergence of drug resistance and for the tolerability of RAF/MEK therapy in patients.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes via physical crossovers. Pioneered by T. H. Morgan and A. Sturtevant over a century ago, methods to estimate recombination rate and genetic distance require scoring large number of recombinant individuals between molecular or visible markers. While high throughput sequencing methods have allowed for genome wide crossover detection producing high resolution maps, such methods rely on large number of recombinants individually sequenced and are therefore difficult to scale. Here, we present a simple and scalable method to infer near chromosome-wide recombination rate from marker selected pools and the corresponding analytical software MarSuPial. Rather than genotyping individuals from recombinant backcrosses, we bulk sequence marker selected pools to infer the allele frequency decay around the selected locus; since the number of recombinant individuals increases proportionally to the genetic distance from the selected locus, the allele frequency across the chromosome can be used to estimate the genetic distance and recombination rate. We mathematically demonstrate the relationship between allele frequency attenuation, recombinant fraction, genetic distance, and recombination rate in marker selected pools. Based on available chromosome-wide recombination rate models of Drosophila, we simulated read counts and determined that nonlinear local regressions (LOESS) produce robust estimates despite the high noise inherent to sequencing data. To empirically validate this approach, we show that (single) marker selected pools closely recapitulate genetic distances inferred from scoring recombinants between double markers. We theoretically determine how secondary loci with viability impacts can modulate the allele frequency decay and how to account for such effects directly from the data. We generated the recombinant map of three wild derived strains which strongly correlates with previous genome-wide measurements. Interestingly, amidst extensive recombination rate variation, multiple regions of the genomes show elevated rates across all strains. Lastly, we apply this method to estimate chromosome-wide crossover interference. Altogether, we find that marker selected pools is a simple and cost effective method for broad recombination rate estimates. Although it does not identify instances of crossovers, it can generate near chromosome-wide recombination maps in as little as one or two libraries.",

Dynamic axon-dendritic positioning can restrict synaptogenic encounters, but the spatiotemporal interaction kinetics and their regulation remain essentially unknown inside developing brains. Here we show that the kinetics of axonal filopodia restrict synapse formation and partner choice for neurons that are not otherwise prevented from making incorrect synapses. Using 4D imaging in developing Drosophila brains, we show that filopodial kinetics are regulated by autophagy, a prevalent degradation mechanism whose role in brain development remains poorly understood. With surprising specificity, autophagosomes form in synaptogenic filopodia, followed by filopodial collapse. Altered autophagic degradation of synaptic building material quantitatively regulates synapse formation as shown by computational modeling and genetic experiments. Increased filopodial stability enables incorrect synaptic partnerships. Hence, filopodial autophagy restricts inappropriate partner choice through a process of kinetic exclusion that critically contributes to wiring specificity.",

Arfgef1fs/+ neurons also display differences in the relative ratio of Arf6+:Rab11+:TrfR+ recycling endosomes. Although the GABAAR-containing early endosomes in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons are comparable to wildtype, Arfgef1fs/+ neurons show an increase in GABAAR-containing lysosomes in dendrite and cell body. Together, the altered endosome composition and decreased neuronal surface GABAAR results suggests a mechanism whereby impaired neuronal inhibition leads to seizure susceptibility.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIArfgef1fs/+ mice have lower seizure threshold but no spontaneous seizure.\\nC_LIO_LIArfgef1fs/+ neurons show reduced dendritic surface GABAAR.\\nC_LIO_LIArfgef1fs/+ neurons have decreased GABAAR-containing recycling endosome accompanied with an increase in GABAAR-containing lysosomes.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSubcortical structures including the basal ganglia have been proposed to be crucial for arousal, consciousness, and behavioural responsiveness. However, how basal ganglia contributes to the loss and recovery of consciousness during anaesthesia has not been well characterized.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, using local field potentials (LFPs) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) and scalp electroencephalogram in 12 Parkinsons disease patients, we investigate STN neural signatures during propofol general anaesthesia and during intubation as an arousal intervention in anaesthesia.\\n\\nResultsPropofol-induced anaesthesia resulted in changes in multiple frequency bands in STN LFPs, including increased low-frequency activities (slow-wave oscillation, delta, theta, and alpha bands) and decreased higher-frequency activities. This was also accompanied by increased STN-frontal cortical coherence in alpha frequency band. Beta and high-gamma activities in the STN temporally increased during intubation compared to the status of loss of consciousness. We also show that the dynamic changes in the high frequency activities (80-180 Hz) in STN LFPs induced by propofol and intubation correlated with power-law exponent in the power spectra between 2 and 80 Hz.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that anaesthesia and intubation induced changes in the STN LFPs in multiple frequency bands. They are also consistent with the hypothesis that the power-law exponent in the power spectra between 2 and 80 Hz reflect the excitation/inhibition balance in the STN, which is modulated by anaesthesia and intubation, and further modulate the high frequency activity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe bladder becomes retentive during the early phase of spinal cord injury, and requires proper bladder management to prevent damage to the lower urinary tract and kidney. We investigated the effects of on-demand pelvic nerve stimulation on the areflexive bladder during the earliest phase of complete spinal cord injury in rats and the use of pelvic nerve signals as a proxy to estimate intravesical pressure for closed-loop applications.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsIn order to stimulate the pelvic nerves in female Sprague-Dawley rats with complete spinal cord transection (T7 level), a flexible electrode was implanted unilaterally on pelvic nerve, and electrical stimulation was provided by a custom-built nerve stimulator. Stimulation-evoked voiding was monitored in the awake state while size, capacity and spontaneous contractions of the bladder were analysed under anaesthesia. Separately, recordings of the pelvic nerve signals, external urethral sphincter activity and intravesical pressure were performed in animals with intact and transected spinal cord under anaesthesia.\\n\\nResultsSuccessful pelvic nerve stimulation enabled more frequent voiding, reduced overdistension of bladder, and preserved non-voiding spontaneous bladder contractions. Typical bladder management protocol for SCI rats (manual expression every 8 - 12 hours) resulted in more severe bladder overdistention. Signal processing of the recorded extraneural pelvic nerve signals successfully reconstructed changes in intravesical pressure, demonstrating their use in estimating the fullness and contractions of the bladder.\\n\\nConclusionsThe preliminary results suggest that pelvic nerve stimulators can serve as an alternative method for frequent emptying of the areflexive bladder. Simultaneous recording of the same pelvic nerve will be useful for development of a closed-loop neuroprosthesis.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades in vitro studies highlighted the potential for crosstalk between Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-(HIF) and glucocorticoid-(GC) signalling pathways. However, how this interplay precisely occurs in vivo is still debated. Here, we use zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio) to elucidate how and to what degree hypoxic signalling affects the endogenous glucocorticoid pathway and vice versa, in vivo. Firstly, our results demonstrate that in the presence of upregulated HIF signalling, both glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) responsiveness and endogenous cortisol levels are repressed in 5 days post fertilisation larvae. In addition, despite HIF activity being low at normoxia, our data show that it already impedes both glucocorticoid activity and levels. Secondly, we further analysed the in vivo contribution of glucocorticoids to HIF activity. Interestingly, our results show that both glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) play a key role in enhancing it. Finally, we found indications that glucocorticoids promote HIF signalling via multiple routes. Cumulatively, our findings allowed us to suggest a model for how this crosstalk occurs in vivo.\n\nAuthor summaryHypoxia is a common pathophysiological condition to which cells must rapidly respond in order to prevent metabolic shutdown and subsequent death. This is achieved via the activity of Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs), which are key oxygen sensors that mediate the ability of the cell to cope with decreased oxygen levels.\n\nAlthough it aims to restore tissue oxygenation and perfusion, it can sometimes be maladaptive and contributes to a variety of pathological conditions including inflammation, tissue ischemia, stroke and growth of solid tumours. In this regard, synthetic glucocorticoids which are analogous to naturally occurring steroid hormones, have been used for decades as anti-inflammatory drugs for treating pathological conditions which are linked to hypoxia (i.e. asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemic injury). Indeed, previous in vitro studies highlighted the presence of a crosstalk between HIF and glucocorticoids. However, how this interplay precisely occurs in an organism and what the molecular mechanism is behind it are questions that still remain unanswered. Here, we provide a thorough in vivo genetic analysis, which allowed us to propose a logical model of interaction between glucocorticoid and HIF signalling. In addition, our results are important because they suggest a new route to downregulate HIF for clinical purposes.",

    "abstract": "The ability to discriminate sub-second intervals can be improved with practice, a process known as temporal perceptual learning (TPL). A central question in TPL is whether training improves the low-level sensory representation of a temporal interval or optimizes a set of task-specific response strategies. Here, we trained three groups of participants over five days on a single-interval temporal discrimination task using either fixed intervals (FI) or random intervals (RI). Before and after training, discrimination thresholds were also obtained on an untrained task. Our results revealed that only the FI group showed improvements with five days of training, but this learning did not generalize from the trained task to the untrained task in any group. These results highlight task-specificity in TPL and suggest that training-dependent improvements in timing ability might reflect an active reweighting of decision units, in addition to refinements in the sensory representation of a learned interval.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamus contains catecholaminergic neurons marked by the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). As multiple chemical messengers coexist in each neuron, we determined if hypothalamic TH-immunoreactive (ir) neurons express glutamate or GABA. We used Cre/loxP recombination to express enhanced GFP fluorescence (EGFP) in neurons that express the vesicular glutamate (vGLUT2) or GABA transporter (vGAT), then determined TH immunoreactivity in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons, respectively. EGFP-positive vGLUT2 neurons were not TH-ir. However, discrete TH-ir signals colocalized with EGFP-positive vGAT neurons, which we validated by in situ hybridization for Vgat mRNA. In order to contextualize the observed pattern of TH+EGFP colocalization in vGAT neurons, we first performed Nissl-based parcellation and plane-of-section analysis, and then mapped the distribution of TH-ir vGAT neurons onto atlas templates from the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) of the mouse brain. TH-ir vGAT neurons were distributed throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hypothalamus. Within the ARA ontology of gray matter regions, TH-ir neurons localized primarily to the periventricular hypothalamic zone, periventricular hypothalamic region, and lateral hypothalamic zone. There was a very strong presence of EGFP fluorescence in TH-ir neurons across all brain regions, but the most striking colocalization was found in the zona incerta (ZI) - a region assigned to the hypothalamus in the ARA - where every TH-ir neuron was EGFP-positive. Neurochemical characterization of these ZI neurons revealed that they display immunoreactivity for dopamine but not dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase. In aggregate, these findings indicate the existence of a novel hypothalamic population in the mouse that may signal through the release of GABA and/or dopamine.",

We evaluated the dynamic changes in the immune contexture of mouse PDA upon MEKi using a multidimensional approach (mRNA analyses, flow cytometry, and immunophenotyping). Effect of MEKi on the viability and metabolism of macrophages was investigated in vitro. We showed that transcriptional signatures of MAP Kinase activation are enriched in aggressive human PDA subtype (squamous/basal-like/quasimesenchymal), while short term MEKi treatment in mouse PDA induced subtype switching. Integrative mRNA expression and immunophenotypic analyses showed that MEKi reshapes the immune landscape of PDA by depleting rather than reprogramming macrophages, while augmenting infiltration by neutrophils. Depletion of macrophages is observed early in the course of in vivo treatment and is at least partially due to their higher sensitivity to MEKi. Tumor-associated macrophages were consistently reported to interfere with gemcitabine uptake by PDA cells. Here, our in vivo studies show a superior antitumor activity upon combination of MEKi and gemcitabine using a sequential rather than simultaneous dosing protocol. Our results show that MEK inhibition induces a dramatic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment of mouse PDA through depletion of macrophages, which substantially improves the antitumor activity of gemcitabine.",

A small subset of these mutations, mostly located in the myosin rod, leads to a progressive skeletal muscle disease known as Laing distal myopathy (MPD1). While this disease has previously been studied using a variety of systems, it has never been studied in the mammalian muscle environment. Here, we describe a mouse model for the MPD1-causing mutation R1500P to elucidate disease pathogenesis and to act as a future platform for testing therapeutic interventions.\\n\\nMethodsBecause mice have very few slow skeletal muscles compared to humans, we generated mice expressing the {beta}-myosin R1500P mutation or WT {beta}-myosin in fast skeletal muscle fibers and determined the structural and functional consequences of the R1500P mutation.\\n\\nResultsThe mutant R1500P myosin affects both muscle histological structure and function and the mice exhibit a number of the histological hallmarks that are often identified in patients with MPD1. Furthermore, R1500P mice show decreased muscle strength and endurance, as well as ultrastructural abnormalities in the SR & t-tubules. Somewhat surprisingly because of its location in the rod, the R1500P mutation weakens acto-myosin binding by affecting cross-bridge detachment rate.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile each group of MPD1-causing mutations most likely operates through distinct mechanisms, our model provides new insight into how a mutation in the rod domain impacts muscle structure and function and leads to disease.",

    "abstract": "Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a ubiquitous vertebrate neuropeptide predominantly synthesized by neurons of the diencephalon that can act through two G protein-coupled receptors, called MCHR1 and MCHR2. The expression of Mchr1 has been investigated in both rats and mice, but its synthesis remains poorly described. After identifying an antibody that detects MCHR1 with high specificity, we employed immunohistochemistry to map the distribution of MCHR1 in the CNS of rats and mice. Multiple neurochemical markers were also employed to characterize some of the neuronal populations that synthesize MCHR1. Our results show that MCHR1 is abundantly found in a sensory subcellular structure called the neuronal primary cilium, which has been associated with the detection of free neurochemical agents released to act through volume transmission. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in a wide range of areas, including the olfactory bulb, cortical mantle, striatum, hippocampal formation, amygdala, midline thalamic nuclei, periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, and midbrain areas. No differences were observed between male and female mice, and rats and mice diverged in two key areas: the caudate-putamen nucleus and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in close association to several neurochemical markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase, calretinin, kisspeptin, estrogen receptor, oxytocin, vasopressin, and corticotropin-releasing factor. Given the role of neuronal primary cilia in sensing free neurochemical messengers in the extracellular fluid, the widespread distribution of ciliary MCHR1, and the diverse neurochemical populations who synthesize MCHR1, our data indicates that volume transmission may play a prominent role in the normal function of the MCH system.",

    "abstract": "Trophoblasts are the principal cell type of the placenta. The use of human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) as a model for studies of early placental development is hampered by limited genetic diversity of existing hTSC lines, and constraints on using human fetal tissue or embryos needed to generate additional cell lines. Here we report the derivation of two distinct stem cells of the trophectoderm lineage from human pluripotent stem cells. The first is a CDX2- stem cell equivalent to primary hTSCs - they both exhibit identical expression of key markers, are maintained in culture and differentiate under similar conditions, and share high transcriptome similarity. The second is a CDX2+ putative human trophectoderm stem cell (hTESC) with distinct cell culture requirements and differences in gene expression and differentiation relative to hTSCs. Derivation of hTSCs and hTESCs from pluripotent stem cells significantly enables construction of models for normal and pathological placental development.",
