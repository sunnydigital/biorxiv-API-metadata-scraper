    "abstract": "The left anterior negativity (LAN) is an ERP component that has been often associated with morphosyntactic processing, but recent reports have questioned whether the LAN effect, in fact, exists. The present project examined whether the LAN effect, observed in the grand average response to local agreement violations, is the result of the overlap between two different ERP effects (N400, P600) at the level of subjects (n=80), items (n=120), or trials (n=6160). By-subject, by-item, and by-trial analyses of the ERP effect between 300 and 500 ms showed a LAN for 55% of the participants, 46% of the items, and 49% of the trials. Many examples of the biphasic LAN-P600 response were observed. Mixed-linear models showed that the LAN effect size was not reduced after accounting for subject variability. The present results suggest that there are cases where the grand average LAN effect represents the brain responses of individual participants, items, and trials.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "Cell wall glycopolymers on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria are fundamental to bacterial physiology and infection biology. These structures have also gained interest as vaccine antigens, in particular for the human pathogens Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus mutans. Streptococcal cell wall glycopolymers are considered to be functional homologues of wall teichoic acids but surprisingly lack the biologically-relevant and characteristic anionic charge. Here we identify gacH, a gene of unknown function in the GAS Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) biosynthetic cluster, in two independent transposon library screens for its ability to confer resistance to zinc and susceptibility to the bactericidal enzyme human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2. To understand the underlying mechanism of these phenotypes, we determined the structure of the extracellular domain of GacH and discover that it represents a new family of glycerol phosphate (GroP) transferases. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of GroP in both the GAC and the homologous Serotype c Carbohydrate (SCC) from S. mutans, which is conferred by gacH and sccH products, respectively. NMR analysis of GAC released from cell wall by non-destructive methods reveals that approximately 30% of the GAC GlcNAc side-chains are modified by GroP at the C6 hydroxyl group. This previously unrecognized structural modification impacts host-pathogen interaction and has implications for vaccine design.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/337519v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d7598org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@435695org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e9515corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc78b7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has been extensively studied in cortical pyramidal neurons, however, the precise structural organization of excitatory inputs that supports STDP, as well as the structural, molecular and functional properties of dendritic spines during STDP remain unknown. Here we performed a spine STDP protocol using two-photon glutamate uncaging to mimic presynaptic glutamate release (pre) paired with somatically generated postsynaptic spikes (post). We found that the induction of STDP in single spines follows a classical Hebbian STDP rule, where pre-post pairings at timings that trigger LTP (t-LTP) produce shrinkage of the activated spine neck and a concomitant increase in its synaptic strength; and post-pre pairings that trigger LTD (t-LTD) decrease synaptic strength without affecting the activated spine shape. Furthermore, we tested whether the single spine-Hebbian STDP rule could be affected by the activation of neighboring (clustered) or distant (distributed) spines. Our results show that the induction of t-LTP in two clustered spines (<5 m apart) enhances LTP through a mechanism dependent on local spine calcium accumulation and actin polymerization-dependent neck shrinkage, whereas t-LTD was disrupted by the activation of two clustered spines but recovered when spines were separated by >40 m. These results indicate that synaptic cooperativity, induced by the co-activation of only two clustered spines, provides local dendritic depolarization and local calcium signals sufficient to disrupt t-LTD and extend the temporal window for the induction of t-LTP, leading to STDP only encompassing LTP.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging techniques such as MRI have been widely used to explore the associations between brain areas. Structural connectivity (SC) captures the anatomical pathways across the brain and functional connectivity (FC) measures the correlation between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity measures have been much studied using network theory in order to uncover the distributed organization of brain structures, in particular FC for task-specific brain communication. However, the application of network theory to study FC matrices is often \"static\" despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by introducing a network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) useful to interpret the brain dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for MOU-EC as well as input properties (similar to local excitabilities). The network analysis is then based on the Green function (or network impulse response) that describes the interactions between nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This model-based approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptor, named communicability, that characterize the roles that either nodes or connections play in the propagation of activity within the network. They can be used at both global and local levels, and also enables the comparison of estimates from real data with surrogates (e.g. random network or ring lattice). In contrast to classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework stresses the importance of taking the temporal aspect of fMRI signals into account. Our results show a merging of functional communities over time (in which input properties play a role), moving from segregated to global integration of the network activity. Our formalism sets a solid ground for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data, including task-evoked activity.",

    "abstract": "Hydrothermal systems, including terrestrial hot springs, contain diverse geochemical conditions that vary over short spatial scales due to progressive interaction between the reducing hydrothermal fluids, the oxygenated atmosphere, and in some cases seawater. At Jinata Onsen, on Shikinejima Island, Japan, an intertidal, anoxic, iron-rich hot spring mixes with the oxygenated atmosphere and seawater over short spatial scales, creating a diversity of chemical potentials and redox pairs over a distance ~10 m. We characterized the geochemical conditions along the outflow of Jinata Onsen as well as the microbial communities present in biofilms, mats, and mineral crusts along its traverse via 16S rDNA amplicon and genome-resolved shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The microbial community changed significantly downstream as temperatures and dissolved iron concentrations decreased and dissolved oxygen increased. Near the spring source, biomass is limited relative to downstream, and primary productivity may be fueled by oxidation of ferrous iron and molecular hydrogen by members of the Zetaproteobacteria and Aquificae. Downstream, the microbial community is dominated by oxygenic Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are abundant and active even at ferrous iron concentrations of ~150 M, which challenges the idea that iron toxicity limited cyanobacterial expansion in Precambrian oceans. Several novel lineages of Bacteria are also present at Jinata Onsen, including previously uncharacterized members of the Chloroflexi and Caldithrichaeota phyla, positioning Jinata Onsen as a valuable site for future characterization of these clades.\n\nImportanceHigh temperatures and reducing conditions allow hot springs to support microbial communities that are very different from those found elsewhere on the surface of the Earth today; in some ways, these environments and the communities they support can be similar to environments that existed on the early Earth and that may exist on other planets. Here, we describe a novel hot spring system where hot, iron-rich but oxygen-poor water flows into the ocean, supporting a range of unique microbial communities. Metagenomic sequencing recovered many novel microbial lineages, including deep-branching and uniquely thermotolerant members of known groups. Comparison of the biological communities in the upstream part of the hot spring, potentially supported by biological iron and hydrogen oxidizing metabolisms, to downstream microbial mats, supported by oxygenic photosynthesis, provides insight into the potential productivity of life during Proterozoic time and on other planets where oxygenic photosynthesis is not possible.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThrough extra genital screening methods, Health Departments and community clinics can increase detection of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) through the application of urethral testing. The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services (LBDHHS) works on preventing cases of chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (GC) from being undiagnosed, by providing extra genital screening.\n\nMethodsRetrospective medical review of 1,571 patient health records, who received CT/GC testing, based on at least 1-visit to the Long Beach Department of Health & Human Services, STD Clinic, between 2012 to 2015. All male patients ages 18 years or older with positive CT/GC results (242 cases) for any of the three sites (e.g. urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal); regardless of their sexual behaviors, were included in the study. Females, those under the age of 18, and patients who tested negative for all three anatomical sites were excluded (1,412 controls).\n\nResultsAt time of collection, study participants had a mean age of 37 years. Reported ethnicity indicated 56% Caucasian, 21% Hispanic or Latino, 9% Asian or Pacific Islander, 7% Other, 5% Black, and 2% More than one race. The use of extra genital screening detected 15% (242) of the 1,571 patients tested positive for at least 1-type of CT/GC infection. Our findings demonstrated that if urine was the only specimen collected, then over 29.7% of CT and 46.8% of GC cases would have been missed.\n\nConclusionsTesting of all three anatomical sites should continue to be performed for CT/GC detection. Cases of CT/GC are underreported if performing urethral screening alone. These results highlight the need for clinicians to perform extra genital screening among male patients for prevention and control. These testing measures may reduce the potential for missing a diagnosis and mitigating transmission.\n\nShort SummaryThe number of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infections missed were determined using extra genital screening procedures among male patients from the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services (LBDHHS), STD/Family Planning Clinic. This method tests urethral, pharyngeal, and rectal sites for CT and GC infection. In this retrospective review of 1,571 patient files, of which 242 tested positive, we determined the proportion of cases that would have remained undetected if only using urethral screening.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment profoundly influence tumor progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining, or single-cell sequencing is often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing.\n\nResultsWe developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of [~]11,000 cells from the tumor microenvironment to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and [~]1,800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined cell-type signatures and propose how fuzzy cell-type signatures can be improved. We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures.\n\nAvailabilityA snakemake pipeline to reproduce the benchmark is available at https://github.com/grst/immune_deconvolution_benchmark.

    "abstract": "Conduction of action potentials along myelinated axons is affected by their structural features, such as the axonal g-ratio, the ratio between the inner and outer diameters of the myelin sheath surrounding the axon. The effect of g-ratio variance on conduction properties has been quantitatively evaluated using single-axon models. It has recently become possible to estimate a g-ratio weighted measurement in vivo using quantitative MRI. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether the variance in the g-ratio in the healthy human brain leads to significant differences in conduction velocity. In this work we tested whether the g-ratio MRI measurement can be used to predict conduction delays in the corpus callosum.\n\nWe present a novel framework in which the structural properties of fibers (i.e. length and g-ratio, measured using MRI), are incorporated in a biophysical model of axon conduction, to predict conduction delays of long-range white matter fibers. We applied this framework to the corpus callosum, and found conduction delay estimates that are compatible with previously estimated values of conduction delays. We account for the variance in the velocity given the axon diameter distribution in the splenium, mid-body and genu, to further compare the fibers within the corpus callosum.\n\nConduction delays have been suggested to increase with age. Therefore, we investigated whether there are differences in the g-ratio and the fiber length between young and old adults, and whether this leads to a difference in conduction speed and delays. We found small but significant differences between the predicted delays of the two groups in the motor fibers of the corpus callosum. We also found that the motor fibers of the corpus callosum have the fastest conduction estimates. Using the axon diameter distributions, we found that the occipital fibers have the slowest estimations, while the frontal and motor fiber tracts have similar estimates.\n\nOur study provides a framework for predicting conduction latencies in vivo. The framework could have major implications for future studies of white matter diseases and large range network computations. Our results highlight the need for improving additional in vivo measurements of white matter microstructure.",

    "abstract": "To form a percept of the environment, the brain needs to solve the binding problem - inferring whether signals come from a common cause and be integrated, or come from independent causes and be segregated. Behaviourally, humans solve this problem near-optimally as predicted by Bayesian Causal Inference; but, the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Combining Bayesian modelling, electroencephalography (EEG), and multivariate decoding in an audiovisual spatial localization task, we show that the brain accomplishes Bayesian Causal Inference by dynamically encoding multiple spatial estimates. Initially, auditory and visual signal locations are estimated independently; next, an estimate is formed that combines information from vision and audition. Yet, it is only from 200 ms onwards that the brain integrates audiovisual signals weighted by their bottom-up sensory reliabilities and top-down task-relevance into spatial priority maps that guide behavioural responses. Critically, as predicted by Bayesian Causal Inference, these spatial priority maps take into account the brains uncertainty about the worlds causal structure and flexibly arbitrate between sensory integration and segregation. The dynamic evolution of perceptual estimates thus reflects the hierarchical nature of Bayesian Causal Inference, a statistical computation, crucial for effective interactions with the environment.",

    "abstract": "Root and leaf traits are one means of understanding plant ecophysiological responses to environmental variation and disturbance. In mangroves, both chemical and morphological variations have been recorded in response to changes in inundation, salinity, and nutrient levels. Some have also been noted in urban environments, primarily in response to elevated nutrients and toxic substances. Yet these studies have not attempted to isolate the urban from the non-urban influences on both morphological and chemical traits. This study measured mangrove leaf and root chemical and morphological traits in herbarium samples and in field collected leaves and roots along a quantified urban gradient in three watersheds of Puerto Rico. It then correlated these traits with predictors of surrounding land cover, as well as with metrics of flooding and water chemistry. There were significant lines of evidence leading to an influence of urban sewage and roads on leaf and root traits. Leaf percent nitrogen increased with urbanization and with surface water nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, but its isotopic content decreased with increasing phosphorus, leading to the hypothesis that both nitrogen and phosphorus are fueling an otherwise co-limited community of mangroves and nitrogen fixing microbes. The most urban site harbored some of the highest metal concentrations, and there was evidence that elevated concentrations primarily influence fine roots. Other morphological traits are more likely explained by both water chemistry and leaf chemistry and should be considered when interpreting the influence of urban landscapes on mangroves. Percent nitrogen in herbarium samples increased at the least urban site, but remained unchanged at the most urban site, reflecting the relative levels of urbanization at the time of the first samples and their subsequent changes. Most metals from herbarium samples decreased or remained unchanged, suggesting regulation and infrastructure have helped to reduce the release of trace metals to the estuaries. Understanding the influence of urbanization in the context of water chemistry and flooding dynamics will aid in the management of these systems as global urbanization continues.",

    "abstract": "The activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) experiences periodically changing nutrient and oxygen availability. Tetrasphaera is the most abundant genus in Danish WWTP and represent up to 20-30% of the activated sludge community based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, although it is in low abundance in the influent wastewater. Here we investigate how Tetrasphaera can successfully out-compete most other microorganisms in such highly dynamic ecosystems. To achive this, we analyze the physiological adaptations of the WWTP isolate T. elongata str. LP2 during an aerobic to anoxic shift by label-free quantitative proteomics and NMR-metabolomics. Escherichia coli was used as reference organism as it shares several metabolic capabilities and is regularly introduced to wastewater treatment plants, but without succeeding there. When compared to E. coli, only minor changes in the proteome of T. elongata were observed after the switch to anoxic conditions. This indicates that metabolic pathways for anaerobic energy harvest were already expressed during the aerobic growth. This allows continuous growth of Tetrasphaera immediately after the switch to anoxic conditions. Metabolomics furthermore revealed that the substrates provided were exploited far more efficiently by Tetrasphaera than by E. coli. These results suggest that T. elongata prosper in the dynamic WWTP environment due to adaptation to the changing environmental conditions.\n\nSignificance of the studyMembers of the genus Tetrasphaera are widely distributed and highly abundant in most well-operating WWTPs with EBPR configuration. However, despite their high abundance in situ, little is known about their physiology and ecological role. Although the importance of Tetrasphaera in engineered wastewater treatment systems is slowly being recognized, additional information is needed to understand the full extent of functions the microorganisms have in many of the essential biological processes in the WWTP. Such information may improve available process models and ultimately lead to better wastewater treatment as well as resource recovery. This study supplies proteomic and metabolomic data on the aerobic/anoxic adaptation of Tetrasphaera and provides a hypothesis on how Tetrasphaera might compete in dynamic engineered systems.",

    "abstract": "The prion hypothesis states that misfolded proteins can act as infectious agents that trigger the misfolding and aggregation of healthy proteins to transmit a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Increasing evidence suggests that pathogenic proteins in Alzheimers disease adapt prion-like mechanisms and spread across the brain along an anatomically connected network. Local kinetics models of protein misfolding and global network models of protein diffusion provide valuable insight into the dynamics of prion-like diseases. Yet, to date, these models have not been combined to simulate how pathological proteins multiply and spread across the human brain. Here we model the prion-like spreading of Alzheimers disease by combining misfolding kinetics and network diffusion through a connectivity-weighted Laplacian graph created from 418 brains of the Human Connectome Project. The nodes of the graph represent anatomic regions of interest and the edges represent their con-nectivity, weighted by the mean fiber number divided by the mean fiber length. We show that our brain network model correctly predicts the neuropathological pattern of Alzheimers disease and captures the key characteristic features of whole brain models at a fraction of their computational cost. To illustrate the potential of brain network modeling in neurodegeneration, we simulate biomarker curves, infection times, and two promising therapeutic strategies to delay the onset of neurodegeneration: reduced production and increased clearance of misfolded protein.",

    "abstract": "The Social Approach Task is commonly used to identify sociability deficits when modeling liability factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mice. It was developed to expand upon assays available to examine distinct aspects of social behavior in rodents and has become a standard component of mouse ASD-relevant phenotyping pipelines. However, there is variability in the statistical analysis and interpretation of results from this task. A common analytical approach is to conduct within-group comparisons only, and then interpret a difference in significance levels as if it were a group difference, without any direct comparison. As an efficient shorthand, we named this approach EWOCs: Erroneous Within-group Only Comparisons. Here we examined the prevalence of EWOCs and used simulations to test whether it could produce misleading inferences. Our review of Social Approach studies of high-confidence ASD genes revealed 45% of papers sampled used only this analytical approach. Through simulations, we then demonstrate how a lack of significant difference within one group often doesnt correspond to a significant difference between groups, and show this erroneous interpretation increases the rate of false positives up to 25%. Finally, we define a simple solution: use an index, like a social preference score, with direct statistical comparisons between groups to identify significant differences. We also provide power calculations to guide sample size in future studies. Overall, elimination of EWOCs and adoption of direct comparisons should result in more accurate, reliable, and reproducible data interpretations from the Social Approach Task across ASD liability models.\n\nLay SummaryThe Social Approach Task is widely used to assess social behavior in mice and is frequently used in studies modeling autism. However, reviewing published studies showed nearly half do not use correct comparisons to interpret the data. Using simulated and original data, we argue the correct statistical approach is a direct comparison of scores between groups. This simple solution should reduce false positives and improve consistency of results across studies.",

Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR), employing genetic data from GWAS of blood lipids (N=188,577), total body BMD (TB-BMD) (N=66,628) and estimated BMD (eBMD) (N=142,487), was performed to infer causality between blood lipids and BMD. Genetic proxies for LDL-C-lowering drugs were used to examine the drugs effects on BMD.\n\nResultsIn NHANES III cohort, each SD decrease in LDL-C was associated with 0.045 SD increase in femoral neck BMD (95% CI: 0.009 to 0.081; P=0.015). A similar increase in BMD was observed in HKOS at femoral neck and lumbar spine. In MR analysis, decrease in genetically predicted LDL-C was associated with increase in TB-BMD [estimate per SD decrease, 0.038 (95% CI: 0.002 to 0.074); P=0.038] and eBMD [0.076 (0.042 to 0.111); P=1.20x10-5]. Reduction of TB-BMD was causally associated with increased LDL-C [0.035 (0.033 to 0.066); P=0.034].

    "abstract": "The most commonly used strategy for peptide identification in shotgun LC-MS/MS proteomics involves searching of MS/MS data against an in-silico digested protein sequence database. Typically, the digested peptide sequences are indexed into the memory to allow faster search times. However, subjecting a database to post-translational modifications (PTMs) during digestion results in an exponential increase in the number of peptides and therefore memory consumption. This limits the usage of existing fragment-ion based open-search algorithms for databases with several PTMs. In this paper, we propose a novel fragment-ion indexing technique which is analogous to suffix array transformation and allows constant time querying of indexed ions. We extend our transformation method, called SLM-Transform, by constructing ion buckets that allow querying of all indexed ions by mass by only storing information on distribution of ion-frequencies within buckets. The stored information is used with a regression technique to locate the position of ions in constant time. Moreover, the number of theoretical b- and y-ions generated and indexed for each theoretical spectrum are limited. Our results show that SLM-Transform allows indexing of up to 4x peptides than other leading fragment-ion based database search tools within the same memory constraints. We show that SLM-Transform based index allows indexing of over 83 million peptides within 26GB RAM as compared to 80GB required by MSFragger. Finally, we show the constant ion retrieval time for SLM-Transform based index allowing ultrafast peptide search speeds.\n\nSource code will be made available at: https://github.com/pcdslab/slmindex",

We previously observed differential responses of two murine K-Ras lung cancer cell lines to anti-PD-1 therapy: CMT167 tumors were eliminated while LLC tumors were resistant. The goal of this study was to define mechanism(s) mediating this difference. RNA-Seq analysis of cancer cells recovered from lung tumors revealed that CMT167 cells induced an IFN{gamma} signature that was absent in LLC cells. Silencing Ifngr1 in CMT167 resulted in tumors resistant to IFN{gamma} and anti-PD-1 therapy. Conversely, LLC cells had high basal expression of Socs1, an inhibitor of IFN{gamma}. Silencing Socs1 increased response to IFN{gamma} in vitro and sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1. This was associated with a reshaped TME, characterized by enhanced T cell infiltration and enrichment of PD-L1 high myeloid cells. These studies demonstrate that targeted enhancement of tumor-intrinsic IFN{gamma} signaling can induce of cascade of changes associated with increased therapeutic vulnerability.\n\nSummaryMechanisms regulating response to anti-PD-1 therapy in lung cancer are not well defined. This study, using orthotopic immunocompetent mouse models of lung cancer, demonstrates that intrinsic sensitivity of cancer cells to IFN{gamma} determines anti-PD-1 responsiveness through alterations in the tumor microenvironment.",

These measurements revealed an underlying functional modularity in which integrin class controlled adhesion size and ECM ligand specificity, while the number and type of connections between integrins and F-actin determined the force per individual integrin. In addition, we found that most integrins existed in a state of near-mechanical equilibrium, a result not predicted by existing models of cytoskeletal force transduction.

Here we show that a large segment of niche theory is equivalent to a Minimum Environmental Perturbation Principle (MEPP): ecosystems self-organize into a state that minimizes the impact of organisms on their environment. Different choices of environmental dynamics naturally give rise to distinct dissimilarity measures for quantifying environmental impact. The MEPP allows for the analysis of ecosystems with large numbers of species and environmental factors and provides a new avenue for analyzing ecological invasions. The MEPP also rigorously connects ecological bistability with the existence of multiple minima in a statistical-physics inspired landscapes. We show that the presence of environmental feedbacks where organisms can produce new resources in addition to depleting them violates the global MEPP. However, even in the presence of such feedbacks, a weaker, local version of the MEPP still applies in a limited region of resource space.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe Infraorder Mygalomorphae is one of the three main lineages of spiders comprising over 3,000 nominal species. This ancient group has a world-wide distribution that includes among its ranks large and charismatic taxa such as tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, and highly venomous funnel web spiders. Based on past molecular studies using Sanger-sequencing approaches, numerous mygalomorph families (e.g., Hexathelidae, Ctenizidae, Cyrtaucheniidae, Dipluridae and Nemesiidae) have been identified as non-monophyletic. However, these data were unable to sufficiently resolve the higher-level (intra- and interfamilial) relationships such that the necessary changes in classification could be made with confidence. Here we present the most comprehensive phylogenomic treatment of the spider infraorder Mygalomorphae conducted to date. We employ 472 loci obtained through Anchored Hybrid Enrichment to reconstruct relationships among all the mygalomorph spider families and estimate the timeframe of their diversification. We performed an extensive generic sampling of all currently recognized families, which has allowed us to assess their status, and as a result, propose a new classification scheme. Our generic-level sampling has also provided an evolutionary framework for revisiting questions regarding silk use in mygalomorph spiders. The first such analysis for the group within a strict phylogenetic framework shows that a sheet web is likely the plesiomorphic condition for mygalomorphs, as well as providing hints to the ancestral foraging behavior for all spiders. Our divergence time estimates, concomitant with detailed biogeographic analysis, suggest that both ancient continental-level vicariance and more recent dispersal events have played an important role in shaping modern day distributional patterns. Based on our results, we relimit the generic composition of the Ctenizidae, Cyrtaucheniidae, Dipluridae and Nemesiidae. We also elevate five subfamilies to family rank: Anamidae (NEW RANK), Euagridae (NEW RANK), Ischnothelidae (NEW RANK), Pycnothelidae (NEW RANK), and Bemmeridae (NEW RANK). The three families Hermachidae (NEW FAMILY), Microhexuridae (NEW FAMILY), and Stasimopidae (NEW FAMILY) are newly proposed. Such a major rearrangement in classification, recognizing eight newly established family-level rank taxa, is the largest the group has seen in over three decades since Ravens (1985) taxonomic treatment.",

The computational pipeline can isolate subject-specific cerebellar lobules based on a spatially unbiased atlas (SUIT) for the cerebellum, and then calculates the lobular electric field distribution during ctDCS. The computational pipeline was tested in a case study using a subject-specific head model as well as using a Colin 27 Average Brain. The 5cmx5cm anode was placed 3 cm lateral to inion, and the same sized cathode was placed on the contralateral supraorbital area (called Manto montage) and buccinators muscle (called Celnik montage). A 4x1 HD-ctDCS electrode montage was also implemented for a comparison using analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nResultsEta-squared effect size after three-way ANOVA for electric field strength was 0.05 for lobule, 0.00 for montage, 0.04 for head model, 0.01 for lobule*montage interaction, 0.01 for lobule* head model interaction, and 0.00 for montage*head model interaction in case of Enorm. Here, the electric field strength of both the Celnik and the Manto montages affected the lobules Crus II, VIIb, VIII, IX of the targeted cerebellar hemispheres while Manto montage had more bilateral effect.

The PHD is dispensable as fission can be managed, albeit at much slower rates, even when the PHD-PIP2 interaction is replaced by a generic polyhistidine- or polylysine-lipid interaction. However, even when the PHD is present, the length of the dynamin scaffold and in turn the membrane remodeling and fission rates are severely restricted with mutations such as I533A on membrane-interacting variable loop 1 (VL1) of PHD. These observations suggest that PIP2-containing membrane interactions of PHD could have evolved to expedite fission to fulfill the requirement of rapid kinetics of synaptic vesicle recycling. Here, we use a suite of multiscale modeling approaches that combine atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, mixed resolution membrane mimetic models, coarse-grained molecular simulations and advanced free-energy sampling methods (metadynamics and umbrella sampling) to explore PHD-membrane interactions. Our results reveal that: (a) the binding of PHD to PIP2-containing membranes modulates the lipids towards fission-favoring conformations and softens the membrane, (b) that PHD engages another loop (VL4) for membrane association, which acts as an auxiliary pivot and modulates the orientation flexibility of PHD on the membrane - a mechanism we believe may be important for high fidelity dynamin collar assembly on the membrane. (c) Through analyses of our trajectories data and free-energy calculations on membrane-bound WT and mutant systems, we also identify key residues on multiple VLs that stabilizes PHD membrane association. And we suggest experiments to explore the ability of PHD to associate with membrane in orientations that favors faster fission. Together, these insights provide a molecular-level understanding of the \"catalytic\" role of the PHD in dynamin-mediated membrane fission.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDynamin, a large multi-domain GTPase, remodels the membrane by self-assembling onto the neck of a budding vesicle and induces fission by its energy driven conformational changes. In this work, we use multi-scale molecular simulations to probe the role of dynamins pleckstrin-homology domain (PHD), which facilitates membrane interactions. Notably, PHD is dispensable for fission as is the case with extant bacterial and mitochondrial dynamins. However, reconstitution experiments suggest that the functional role of PHD in neuronal-membrane goes beyond that of an adaptor domain as it possibly  expedites the fission reaction during synaptic vesicle recycling. We provide a molecular-dynamics picture of how PHDs make membranes more pliable for fission and suggest new insights into the molecular-level processes driving the expedited fission behavior.",

Here we sought to identify the respiratory epithelial dynamics and molecular signatures participating in adult lung maintenance and chemical carcinogenesis. We employed novel mouse models of respiratory epithelial marking and ablation, a battery of pulmonary toxins and carcinogens, experimental protocols of carcinogen-induced LUAD, tobacco carcinogen-induced LUAD cell lines, and human transcriptomic data and identified a prominent involvement of airway molecular programs in alveolar maintenance and carcinogen-induced LUAD. The airway-specific transcriptomic signature was redistributed to the alveoli after toxic and carcinogenic insults and resulted in marked contributions of airway-labeled cells to injury-recovered alveoli and LUAD. Airway cells maintained Kras mutations and therefore possibly contributed to lung cancer initiation, while LUAD were spatially linked to neighboring airways. Transcriptomic profiling of carcinogen-induced murine and human LUAD revealed enrichment in airway signatures, while ablation of airway cells distorted alveolar structure and function and protected mice from LUAD development. Collectively, these results indicate that airway cells and/or transcriptomic signatures are essential for alveolar maintenance and LUAD development.",

In plants and animals with mosaic genomic methylation, functionally mysterious methylation is also common within constitutively active housekeeping genes. Here we show that H1 is enriched in methylated sequences, including genes, of Arabidopsis thaliana, yet this enrichment is independent of DNA methylation. Loss of H1 disperses heterochromatin, globally alters nucleosome organization, and activates H1-bound genes, but only weakly de-represses transposable elements. However, H1 loss strongly activates transposable elements hypomethylated through mutation of DNA methyltransferase MET1. Loss of H1 also activates antisense transcripts within demethylated genes. Our results demonstrate that H1 and DNA methylation cooperatively maintain transcriptional homeostasis by silencing transposable elements and aberrant intragenic transcripts. Such functionality plausibly explains why DNA methylation, a well-known mutagen, has been maintained within coding sequences of crucial plant and animal genes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIHistone H1 is enriched in methylated DNA independently of methylation\nC_LIO_LILoss of H1 activates genes, alters nucleosome organization and disperses heterochromatin\nC_LIO_LIDNA methylation and H1 jointly silence transposons\nC_LIO_LIDNA methylation and H1 cooperatively suppress intragenic antisense transcripts\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We earlier reported cytoplasmic fluorescence exchange between cultured human fibroblasts (Fib) and malignant cells (MC). Others report similar transfer via either tunneling nanotubes (TNT) or shed membrane vesicles and this changes the phenotype of recipient cells. Our current time-lapse microscopy showed most exchange was from Fib into MC, with less in the reverse direction. Although TNT were seen, we were surprised transfer was not via TNT, but was instead via fine and often branching cell projections that defied direct visual resolution because of their size and rapid movement. Their structure was revealed nonetheless, by their organellar cargo and the grooves they formed indenting MC, while this was consistent with holotomography. Discrete, rapid and highly localized transfer events, evidenced against a role for shed vesicles. Transfer coincided with rapid retraction of the cell-projections, suggesting a hydrodynamic mechanism. Increased hydrodynamic pressure in retracting cell-projections normally returns cytoplasm to the cell body. We hypothesize  cell-projection pumping (CPP), where cytoplasm in retracting cell-projections partially equilibrates into adjacent recipient cells via micro-fusions that form temporary inter-cellular cytoplasmic continuities. We tested plausibility for CPP by combined mathematical modelling, comparison of predictions from the model with experimental results, and then computer simulations based on experimental data. The mathematical model predicted preferential CPP into cells with lower cell stiffness, expected from equilibration of pressure towards least resistance. Predictions from the model were satisfied when Fib were co-cultured with MC, and fluorescence exchange related with cell stiffness by atomic force microscopy. When transfer into 5000 simulated recipient MC or Fib was studied in computer simulations, inputting experimental cell stiffness and donor cell fluorescence values generated transfers to simulated recipient cells similar to those seen by experiment. We propose CPP as a potentially novel mechanism in mammalian inter-cellular cytoplasmic transfer and communication.\n\nSIGNIFICANCETime-lapse observations of co-cultured cells led us to hypothesize what we believe to be a novel hydrodynamic mechanism transferring cytoplasm between cells. Similar transfer by other mechanisms markedly affects cell behavior. Combined mathematical modelling, satisfaction of predictions from the mathematical model in cell culture experiments, and separate computer simulations that generate outcomes similar to experimental observations, support our hypothesized mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Unless they adapt, populations facing persistent stress are threatened by extinction. Theoretically, populations facing stress can react by either disruption, increasing trait variation, or stabilisation, decreasing trait variation. In the short term, the more economical response is stabilisation, because it quickly transfers a large part of the population closer to a new ecological optimum. However, canalisation is deleterious in the face of persistently increasing stress because it reduces variability and thus decreases the ability to react to further change in stress. Understanding how natural populations react to intensifying stress reaching terminal levels is key to assessing their resilience to environmental change such as that caused by global warming. Because extinctions are hard to predict, observational data on the adaptive reaction of populations facing extinction are rare. In this study, we make use of the glacial salinity rise in the Red Sea as a natural experiment allowing us to analyse the reaction of planktonic Foraminifera to stress escalation in the geological past. We analyse morphological trait state and variance in two species across a salinity rise leading to their local extinction. One species reacted by stabilisation in shape and size, detectable several thousand years prior to extinction. The second species reacted by trait divergence, but each of the two divergent populations remains stable or reacted by further stabilisation. These observations indicate that the default reaction of the studied Foraminifera is stabilisation and that stress escalation did not lead to the local emergence of adapted forms. Inability to breach the global adaptive threshold would explain why communities of Foraminifera, and many other groups of marine plankton, reacted to Quaternary climate change by faithfully tracking their zonally shifting environments. It also means that populations of marine species adapted to response by migration, when exposed to stress outside of the adaptive range, will be at risk of extinction.",

In order to understand how adaptation in heterogeneous environments constrains such distributions, we analyze how the potential of adaptation along an environmental cline affects the geographical distribution and propagation dynamics (invasion or extinction) of a single species. We re-analyse a model initially proposed by Kirkpatrick and Barton using propagation speed to assess whether species distribution is spatially limited or not.\n\nWe found that for big adaptation potentials, the species invades space following Fishers model, whereas for small adaptation potentials the propagation depends on the evolutionary challenge to overcome. We have explicit approximations for the propagation speeds in both cases. We discuss the utility of these propagation speeds as an eco-evolutionary index based on empirical studies.",

Here we describe the same measurements in an older group of school-aged children (6 to 8 years old) and an adult control group, in addition to repeated recordings in seven children from the original study approximately two years later. Differences were observed both longitudinally within children and between age groups. Pre-movement (readiness) fields were still not present in the oldest children, however both frequency and magnitude of movement-related mu (8-12Hz) and beta (15-30Hz) oscillations demonstrated linear increases with age. In contrast, movement-evoked gamma synchronization demonstrated a step-like transition from low (30-50 Hz) to high (70-90 Hz) narrow-band oscillations, and this occurred at different ages in different children. These data provide novel evidence of linear and non-linear changes in motor cortex oscillations and delayed development of the readiness field throughout early childhood. Individual children showed large differences in maturation of movement-related brain activity, possibly reflecting differing rates of motor development.",

Although a recommended dose management algorithm for dofetilide exists, there is a range of real-world approaches to dosing the medication. In this multicenter investigation, we examined the decision process for dose adjustment of dofetilide during the observation period using machine-learning approaches, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning applications. Logistic regression approaches identified any dose-adjustment as a strong negative predictor of successful loading (i.e., discharged on dofetilide) of the medication (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.12 - 0.31, p < 0.001 for discharge on dofetilide), indicating that these adjustments are strong determinants of whether patients \"tolerate\" the medication. Using multiple supervised approaches, including regularized logistic regression, random forest, boosted gradient decision trees, and neural networks, we were unable to identify any model that predicted dose adjustments better than a naive approach. A reinforcement-learning algorithm, in contrast, predicted which patient characteristics and dosing decisions that resulted in the lowest risk of failure to be discharged on the medication.

To deconvolute the relationship between transcriptomic changes and aging one needs to conduct an analysis on the comprehensive dataset. At the same time, biological aging clocks constructed for clinical use needs to robustly predict new data without any further retraining. In this paper, we develop a transcriptomic deep-learned age predictor. Deep neural networks (DNN) are trained and tested on more than 6 000 blood gene expression samples from 17 datasets. We apply methods based on output derivatives of DNN to rank input genes by their importance in age prediction and reduce the dimensional of the data. We also show that batch effect in transcriptome datasets of healthy humans is indeed significant, but the existing normalization techniques, while removing technical variation quite effectively, also remove age-associated changes.

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging techniques are increasingly used to study brain cognition in humans. Beyond their individual activation, the functional associations between brain areas have become a standard proxy to describe how information is distributed across the brain network. Among the many analysis tools available, dynamic models of brain activity have been developed to overcome the limitations of original connectivity measures such as functional connectivity. In particular, much effort has been devoted to the assessment of directional interactions between brain areas from their observed activity. This paper summarizes our recent approach to analyze fMRI data based on our whole-brain effective connectivity referred to as MOU-EC, while discussing the pros and cons of its underlying assumptions with respect to other established approaches. Once tuned, the model provides a connectivity measure that reflects the dynamical state of BOLD activity obtained using fMRI, which can be used to explore the brain cognition. We focus on two important applications. First, as a connectivity measure, MOU-EC can be used to extract biomarkers for task-specific brain coordination, understood as the patterns of areas exchanging information. The multivariate nature of connectivity measures raises several challenges for whole-brain analysis, for which machine-learning tools presents some advantages over statistical testing. Second, we show how to interpret changes in MOU-EC connections in a collective and model-based manner, bridging with network analysis. To illustrate our framework, we use a dataset where subjects were recorded in two conditions, watching a movie and a black screen (referred to as rest). Our framework provides a comprehensive set of tools that open exciting perspectives for the study of distributed cognition, as well as neuropathologies.",

    "abstract": "Apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons integrate information from higher-order cortex and thalamus, and gate signaling and plasticity at proximal synapses. In the hippocampus, neurogliaform cells and other interneurons located within stratum lacunosum-moleculare mediate powerful inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neuron distal dendrites. Is the recruitment of such inhibition itself subject to use-dependent plasticity, and if so, what induction rules apply? Here we show that interneurons in mouse stratum lacunosum-moleculare exhibit Hebbian NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). Such plasticity can be induced by selective optogenetic stimulation of afferent fibers in the temporoammonic pathway from the entorhinal cortex, but not by equivalent stimulation of afferents from the thalamic nucleus reuniens. We further show that theta-burst patterns of afferent firing induces LTP in neurogliaform interneurons identified using neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (Ndnf)-Cre mice. Theta-burst activity of entorhinal cortex afferents led to an increase in disynaptic feed-forward inhibition, but not monosynaptic excitation, of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity of neurogliaform cells in stratum lacunosum-moleculare thus alters the excitation-inhibition balance at entorhinal cortex inputs to the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, implying a dynamic role for these interneurons in gating CA1 dendritic computations.\n\nSignificance statementElectrogenic phenomena in distal dendrites of principal neurons in the hippocampus have a major role in gating synaptic plasticity at afferent synapses on proximal dendrites. Apical dendrites also receive powerful feed-forward inhibition mediated in large part by neurogliaform neurons. Here we show that theta-burst activity in afferents from the entorhinal cortex induces  Hebbian long-term potentiation at excitatory synapses recruiting these GABAergic cells.

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells distinguish cancer cells from healthy cells using an array of germline-encoded receptors that interact with ligands expressed on target cells. A balance of inhibitory and activating signals transduced by these receptors regulate NK cell function to provide anti-tumor immunity while maintaining self-tolerance. However, knowledge of the spectrum of factors regulating NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, including the contribution of specific ligands and regulatory mechanisms for their expression on tumor cells, remains incomplete. Here, we apply a genome-wide loss-of-function screen in tumor cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to identify the factors that promote NK-cell cytotoxicity towards tumor cells. We established the drivers of tumor-cell sensitivity towards NK-cell attack (TuSeNKA) screening approach using the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line, K562. Interestingly, we identified B7H6, the ligand for the activating NK cell receptor NKp30, as the single factor whose loss resulted in increased resistance of K562 cells towards NK cells. Our study shows that combination of CRISPR-based genetic screens with NK-cell cytotoxicity assays is a valuable tool for identifying functionally relevant NK cell-tumor cell interactions, paving the way for further investigations that unravel the complexity of signals that promote NK-cell recognition of transformed cells and develop therapies that target these modes of tumor-cell killing.",

    "abstract": "CREBBP mutations are highly recurrent in B-cell lymphomas and either inactivate its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain or truncate the protein. Herein, we show that these two classes of mutations yield different degrees of disruption of the epigenome, with HAT mutations being more severe and associated with inferior clinical outcome. Genes perturbed by CREBBP mutation are direct targets of the BCL6/HDAC3 onco-repressor complex. Accordingly, we show that HDAC3 selective inhibitors fully reverse CREBBP mutant aberrant epigenetic programming resulting in: a) growth inhibition of lymphoma cells through induction of BCL6 target genes such as CDKN1A and b) restoration of immune surveillance due to induction of BCL6 repressed IFN pathway and antigen presentation genes. By reactivating these genes, exposure to HDAC3-i restored the ability of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes to kill DLBCL cells in an MHC II and MHC I dependent manner. Hence HDAC3-i represent a novel mechanism-based immune-epigenetic therapy for CREBBP mutant lymphomas.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe have leveraged the molecular characterization of different types of CREBBP mutations to define a rational approach for targeting these mutations through selective inhibition of HDAC3. This represents an attractive therapeutic avenue for targeting synthetic vulnerabilities in CREBBP mutant cells in tandem with promoting anti-tumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism for nucleus centering in mouse oocytes results from a gradient of actin-positive vesicles. By microinjecting oil droplets and fluorescent beads, we analyze the consequences of the gradient of activity on transport of exogenous tracer particles of different sizes. We also use optical tweezers to probe rheological properties of the cytoplasm. We find that the gradient activity induces a general centering force, akin to an effective pressure gradient, leading to centering of oil droplets with velocities comparable to nuclear ones. High temporal resolution measurements reveal that passive particles, larger than 1{micro}m, experience the activity gradient by a biased diffusion towards the cell center. Unexpectedly, this general and size dependent mechanism is maintained in Meiosis I but contrasted by a further process that specifically off-centers the spindle. These antagonizing processes depend on myosin activity, thus we reconcile how the same molecular actors can have two opposite functions (centering versus off-centering).",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are membrane vesicles secreted by cells and distributed widely in all biofluids. Exosomes can modulate the biological activities of cells in a paracrine or endocrine manner, in part by transferring their content, such as miRNA, following uptake in recipient cells. Fluorescent labelling of exosomes is a commonly used technique for understanding their cellular targeting and biodistribution. Lipophilic fluorescent dyes such as those in the PKH family have been widely used for exosome labelling. One concern with the use of lipophilic dyes is an increase in the exosome size due to membrane fusion or intercalation. This size shift alone may undermine the validity of exosomes tracing studies as small changes in the size of inorganic nanoparticles are known to affect their cellular uptake and biodistribution. Here, the possibility of minimizing the size shift of PKH labelled exosomes was systematically studied by changing the labelling condition. Unfortunately, the size shift towards larger particles was observed in all the PKH labelling conditions, including those where the labelled exosomes were below the fluorescent detection limit. As opposed to lipophilic dyes, no significant shift in the size of labelled exosomes was detected with protein binding dyes. Since the size shifts identified in all the PKH labelling conditions are likely to affect the cellular uptake and biodistribution, PKH may not be a reliable technique for exosomes tracking.",

    "abstract": "Following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, the ligament is often reconstructed with a tendon graft passed through bone marrow tunnels. This procedure results in a staged repair response where cell death occurs in the tendon graft, the graft is repopulated by host cells outside the graft, and tendon-to-bone attachments form at the graft/bone interface. While this healing process is well appreciated, the biological mechanisms that regulate it including the cellular origin of the repair response is poorly understood. Embryonic progenitor cells expressing growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) give rise to several mesenchymal tissues in the joint and epiphyses. Therefore, we hypothesized that cells from a GDF5 origin, even in the adult tissue, would give rise to cells that contribute to the stages of repair following ACL reconstruction. ACLs were reconstructed in Gdf5Cre;R26R-tdTomato lineage tracing mice to monitor the contribution of Gdf5Cre;tdTom+ cells to graft revitalization and examine the extent to which these cells are capable of creating mineralized attachments within the bone tunnels. Anterior-posterior drawer tests were used to establish the stability of the knee following the procedure and demonstrated 58% restoration in anterior-posterior stability. Following reconstruction, Gdf5Cre;tdTom+ cells within the bone marrow expanded by 135-fold compared to intact controls in response to the injury. These cells migrated to the tendon graft interface, repopulated regions of the graft, and initiated tendon-to-bone attachments. These cells continued to organize and mature the attachments yielding a zonal insertion site at 4 weeks with collagen fibers spanning across unmineralized and mineralized fibrocartilage and anchored to adjacent bone. The zonal attachment possessed organized tidemarks with concentrated alkaline phosphatase activity similar to normal tendon or ligament entheses. This study established that mesenchymal cells from a GDF5 origin contribute to the creation of zonal tendon-to-bone attachments within bone tunnels following ACL reconstruction. Future studies will target this cell population to modulate the repair response in order to better understand key biological mechanisms that regulate tendon-to-bone repair.",

    "abstract": "Soil protists are increasingly appreciated as essential components of soil foodwebs; however, there is a dearth of information on the factors structuring their communities. Here we investigate the importance of different biotic and abiotic factors as key drivers of spatial and seasonal distribution of protistan communities. We conducted an intensive survey of a 10m2 grassland plot in Germany, focusing on a major group of protists, the Cercozoa. From 177 soil samples, collected from April to November, we obtained 694 Operational Taxonomy Units representing >6 million Illumina reads. All major cercozoan groups were present, dominated by the small flagellates of the Glissomonadida. We found evidence of environmental filtering structuring the cercozoan communities both spatially and seasonally. Spatial analyses indicated that communities were correlated within a range of four meters. Seasonal variations of bactevirores and bacteria, and that of omnivores after a time-lapse, suggested a dynamic prey-predator succession. The most influential edaphic properties were moisture and clay content, which differentially affected each functional group. Our study is based on an intense sampling of protists at a small scale, thus providing a detailed description of the niches occupied by different taxa/functional groups and the ecological processes involved.",

SumHer is a newly-introduced alternative with similar aims. We show using theory and simulations that both approaches fail to adequately account for confounding bias, even when the assumed heritability model is correct. Consequently, these methods may estimate heritability poorly if there was inadequate adjustment for confounding in the original GWAS analysis. We also show that choice of summary statistic for use in LDSC or SumHer can have a large impact on resulting inferences. Further, covariate adjustments in the original GWAS can alter the target of heritability estimation, which can be problematic when LDSC or SumHer is applied to test statistics from a meta-analysis of GWAS with different covariate adjustments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTsetse flies (Glossina sp.) are the sole vectors of human and animal trypanosomiasis throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Tsetse are distinguished from other Diptera by unique adaptations, including lactation and the birthing of live young (obligate viviparity), a vertebrate blood specific diet by both sexes and obligate bacterial symbiosis. This work describes comparative analysis of six Glossina genomes representing three sub-genera: Morsitans (G. morsitans morsitans (G.m. morsitans), G. pallidipes, G. austeni), Palpalis (G. palpalis, G. fuscipes) and Fusca (G. brevipalpis) which represent different habitats, host preferences and vectorial capacity.\n\nResultsGenomic analyses validate established evolutionary relationships and sub-genera. Syntenic analysis of Glossina relative to Drosophila melanogaster shows reduced structural conservation across the sex-linked X chromosome. Sex linked scaffolds show increased rates of female specific gene expression and lower evolutionary rates relative to autosome associated genes. Tsetse specific genes are enriched in protease, odorant binding and helicase activities.\n\nLactation associated genes are conserved across all Glossina species while male seminal proteins are rapidly evolving. Olfactory and gustatory genes are reduced across the genus relative to other characterized insects. Vision associated Rhodopsin genes show conservation of motion detection/tracking functions and significant variance in the Rhodopsin detecting colors in the blue wavelength ranges.\n\nConclusionsExpanded genomic discoveries reveal the genetics underlying Glossina biology and provide a rich body of knowledge for basic science and disease control. They also provide insight into the evolutionary biology underlying novel adaptations and are relevant to applied aspects of vector control such as trap design and discovery of novel pest and disease control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome studies evaluating whole blood and tissues are often confounded by overrepresentation of highly abundant transcripts. These abundant transcripts are problematic as they compete with and prevent the detection of rare RNA transcripts, obscuring their biological importance. This issue is more pronounced when using long-read sequencing technologies for isoform-level transcriptome analysis, as they have relatively lower throughput compared to short-read sequencers. As a result long-read based transcriptome analysis is prohibitively expensive for non-model organisms. While there are off-the-shelf kits available for select model organisms capable of depleting highly abundant transcripts for alpha (HBA) and beta (HBB) hemoglobin, they are unsuitable for non-model organisms. To address this, we have adapted the recent CRISPR/Cas9 based depletion method (Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization) for long-read full-length cDNA sequencing approaches that we call Long-DASH. Using a recombinant Cas9 protein with appropriate guide RNAs, full-length hemoglobin transcripts can be depleted in-vitro prior to performing any short- and long-read sequencing library preparations. Using this method, we sequenced depleted full-length cDNA in parallel using both our Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) based R2C2 long-read approach, as well as the Illumina short-read based Smart-seq2 approach. To showcase this, we have applied our methods to create an isoform-level transcriptome from whole blood samples derived from three polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Using Long-DASH, we succeeded in depleting hemoglobin transcripts and generated deep Smart-seq2 Illumina datasets and 3.8 million R2C2 full-length cDNA consensus reads. Applying Long-DASH with our isoform identification pipeline, Mandalorion we discovered ~6,000 high-confidence isoforms and a number of novel genes. This indicates there is a high diversity of gene isoforms within Ursus maritimus not yet reported. This reproducible and straightforward approach has not only improved the polar bear transcriptome annotations but will serve as the foundation for future efforts to investigate transcriptional dynamics within the 19 polar bear subpopulations around the Arctic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn newborns, severe congenital heart defects are rarer than mild ones. The reason why is unknown, but presumably related to a liability threshold that rises with the severity of a defect. Because the same genetic mutation can cause different defects, other variables may contribute to pushing an individual past a defect-specific liability threshold. We consider here how variables in the genetic architecture of a heart defect depend upon its fitness cost, as defined by the likelihood of survival to reproductive age in natural history studies.\n\nMethodsWe phenotyped ~10,000 Nkx2-5+/- newborn mice, a model of human congenital heart disease, from two inbred strain crosses. Genome-wide association analyses detected loci that modify the risk of an atrial septal defect, membranous or muscular ventricular septal defect, or atrioventricular septal defect. The number of loci, heritability and quantitative effects on risk of pairwise (GxGNkx) and higher-order (GxGxGNkx) epistasis between the loci and Nkx2-5 mutation were examined as a function of the fitness cost of a defect.\n\nResultsNkx2-5+/- mice have pleiotropic heart defects; about 70% have normal hearts. The model recapitulates the epidemiological relationship between the severity and incidence of a heart defect. Neither the number of modifier loci nor heritability depends upon the severity of a defect, but GxGNkx and GxGxGNkx effects on risk do. Interestingly, GxGxGNkx effects are three times more likely to suppress risk when the genotypes at the first two loci are homozygous and from the same, rather than opposite strains in a cross. Syn- and anti-homozygous genotypes at GxGxGNkx interactions can have an especially large impact on the risk of an atrioventricular septal defect.\n\nConclusionsGiven a modestly penetrant mutation, epistasis contributes more to the risk of severe than mild congenital heart defect. Conversely, genetic compatibility between interacting genes, as indicated by the protective effects of syn-homozygosity at GxGxGNkx interactions, plays a newfound role in the robustness of cardiac development. The experimental model offers practical insights into the nature of genetic risk in congenital heart disease. The results more fundamentally address a longstanding question regarding how mutational robustness could arise from natural selection.",
