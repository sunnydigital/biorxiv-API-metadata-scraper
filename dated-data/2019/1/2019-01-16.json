    "abstract": "The Hamiltonian function of a network, derived from the intrinsic distributions of nodes and edges, magnified by resolution parameter has information on the distribution of energy in the network. In brain networks, the Hamiltonian function follows hierarchical features reflecting a power-law behavior which can be a signature of self-organization. Further, the transition of three distinct phases driven by resolution parameter is observed which could correspond to various important brain states. This resolution parameter could thus reflect a key parameter that controls and balances the energy distribution in the brain network.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate immune system can produce antibodies that protect the host against pathogens. Females can transmit antibodies to their offspring, which provide short-term protection against infection. The tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii causes Lyme disease in Europe and consists of multiple strains that cycle between the tick vector (Ixodes ricinus) and vertebrate hosts such as the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). We used a controlled experiment to show that infected female bank voles transmit protective antibodies to their offspring that are specific for the strain of B. afzelii. To test the specificity of protection, the offspring were challenged with either the same strain to which the mothers had been exposed or a different strain. The maternal antibodies protected the offspring against the same strain, but not against the different strain. The offspring from the uninfected control mothers were equally susceptible to both strains. Our study shows that maternal antibodies provide strong but highly strain-specific protection against B. afzelii in an important rodent reservoir host. The transmission of maternal antibodies may have important consequences for the epidemiology of multiple-strain pathogens in nature.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMany pathogens that cause infectious disease consist of multiple strains. In vertebrate hosts, the immune system can generate antibodies that are highly specific for different pathogen strains. Mothers can transmit these antibodies to their offspring and thereby protect them from infectious disease. To date, few studies have investigated whether this transgenerational transfer of protective antibodies is important for pathogens that cycle in wild animal populations. The tick-borne spirochete bacterium Borrelia afzelii causes Lyme disease in Europe and cycles between Ixodes ticks and wild rodent hosts, such as the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). The purpose of our study was to test whether female bank voles infected with B. afzelii transmit antibodies to their offspring that protect them from an infected tick bite. Our study found that infected mothers do transmit antibodies, but the offspring were only protected against the strain of B. afzelii to which their mothers had been exposed and not to a different strain (i.e. protection was highly strain-specific). The broader implications of our study is that the transfer of protective antibodies between generations in the vertebrate host population could be important for organizing the community of pathogen strains that circulate in nature.",

    "abstract": "Children with sickle cell anemia have elevated stroke risks as well as other arterial complications, but morphological changes to large arteries are not well defined, and the focus has been on the microcirculation where deoxygenation promotes sickling of red blood cells. The goal of this study was to define morphological changes in carotid and cerebral arteries in the Townes transgenic sickle cell mouse model, and to specifically determine anatomical measurement differences in mice homozygous for {beta}-globin S mutation (SS) compared to heterozygous (AS) littermate controls. We used a combination of live imaging with ultrasound and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) imaging of corrosion casted vessels to quantify arterial dimensions and changes in mice 4, 12, and 24 weeks of age with or without sickle cell anemia. 12 week SS mice had significantly larger common carotid artery diameters than AS mice, and significantly larger diameters in the extracranial and intracranial portions of the internal carotid artery (ICA), determined by ultrasound and micro-CT, respectively. There were also side specific differences between the left and right vessels. There was significant narrowing along ICA length in 12-and 24-week SS mice, decreasing by as much as 70%, such that there was no difference in size between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, where the ICA terminates, by genotype. Significant narrowing along the length was also measured in the anterior cerebral arteries of 12-and 24-week SS mice, but not AS. Collectively, these findings indicate that sickle cell anemia causes increased arterial dimensions in 12-and 24-week aged mice. We also provide these measurements for the common carotid, internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral arteries for left and right sides, for AS and SS genotypes as a reference for other investigators using in silico modeling of arterial complications caused by aging with sickle cell anemia.",

In the zebrafish, mutation of adgrg6 also results in defects in the inner ear: otic tissue fails to down-regulate versican gene expression and morphogenesis is disrupted. We have designed a whole-animal screen that tests for rescue of both up- and down-regulated gene expression in mutant embryos, together with analysis of weak and strong alleles. From a screen of 3120 structurally diverse compounds, we have identified 68 that reduce versican b expression in the adgrg6 mutant ear, 41 of which also restore myelin basic protein gene expression in Schwann cells of mutant embryos. Nineteen compounds unable to rescue a strong adgrg6 allele provide candidates for molecules that interact directly with the Adgrg6 receptor. Our pipeline provides a powerful approach for identifying compounds that modulate GPCR activity, with potential impact for future drug design.",

    "abstract": "Species and ecosystems usually face more than one threat. The damage caused by these multiple threats can accumulate nonlinearly: either subadditively, when the joint damage of combined threats is less than the damages of both threats individually added together, or superadditively, when the joint damage is greater than the two individual damages added together. These additivity dynamics are commonly attributed to the nature of the threatening processes, but conflicting empirical observations challenge this assumption. Here, we use a theoretical model to demonstrate that the additivity of threats can change with different magnitudes of threat impacts (effect of a threat on the population parameter, like growth rate). We use a harvested single-species population model to integrate the effects of multiple threats on equilibrium abundance. Our results reveal that threats do not always display consistent additive behavior, even in simple systems. Instead, their additivity depends on the magnitudes of the impacts of two threats, and the population parameter that is impacted by each threat. In our model specifically, when multiple threats have a low impact on the growth rate of a population, they display superadditive dynamics. In contrast, threats that impact the species carrying capacity are always additive or subadditive. These dynamics can be understood by reference to the curvature of the relationship between a given population parameter (e.g., growth) and equilibrium population size. Our results suggest that management actions can achieve amplified benefits if they target low-amplitude threats that affect the growth rate, since these will be in a superadditive phase. More generally, our results suggest that cumulative impact theory should focus more than previously on the magnitude of the impact on the population parameter, and should be cautious about attributing additive dynamics to particular threat combinations.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate and compared the satisfaction and quality of life of edentulous users of total tissue-supported and total implant-supported prostheses in Macapa, Amapa, Brazil. Two hundred ninety-nine users of total tissue-supported prostheses and 48 users of total implant-supported prostheses were surveyed using two questionnaires: The Oral Health Impact Profile-14Br and a visual analog scale of satisfaction. The means and standard deviations were used to characterize the quantitative variables and absolute and relative frequencies were used to characterize the qualitative variables as well as certain quantitative variables. When evaluating users satisfaction according to the type of prosthesis, we found that users of implant-supported prostheses were 100% satisfied with both upper and lower prostheses. By contrast, among users of tissue-supported prostheses, 90% reported being satisfied with the upper prosthesis, while 56% demonstrated some dissatisfaction with the lower removable prosthesis. All users of implant-supported prostheses reported good quality of life; by contrast, only 5% of users of tissue-supported prostheses reported good quality of life, while 73% reported a reasonable quality of life and 22% a poor quality of life. To our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in Amapa. The study results are clinically relevant for accurately determining the quality of life of these prosthesis users.",

    "abstract": "Measuring vision in rodents is a critical step for understanding vision, improving models of human disease, and developing therapies. Established behavioural tests for perceptual vision, such as the visual water task, rely on learning. The learning process, while effective for sighted animals, can be laborious and stressful in animals with impaired vision, requiring long periods of training. Current tests that that do not require training are based on sub-conscious, reflex responses (e.g. optokinetic nystagmus) that dont require involvement of visual cortex and higher order thalamic nuclei. A potential alternative for measuring vision relies on using visually guided innate defensive responses, such as escape or freeze, that involve cortical and thalamic circuits. In this study we address this possibility in mice with intact and degenerate retinas. We first develop automatic methods to detect behavioural responses based on high dimensional tracking and changepoint detection of behavioural time series. Using those methods, we show that visually guided innate responses can be elicited using parametisable stimuli, and applied to describing the limits of visual acuity in healthy animals and discriminating degrees of visual dysfunction in mouse models of retinal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Scalable production of gene-length single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with sequence control has applications in homology directed repair templating, gene synthesis and sequencing, scaffolded DNA origami, and archival DNA memory storage. Biological production of circular single-stranded DNA (cssDNA) using bacteriophage M13 addresses these needs at low cost. A primary goal toward this end is to minimize the essential protein coding regions of the produced, exported sequence while maintaining its infectivity and production purity, with engineered regions of sequence control. Synthetic miniphage constitutes an ideal platform for bacterial production of isogenic cssDNA, using inserts of custom sequence and size to attain this goal, offering an inexpensive resource at milligram and higher synthesis scales. Here, we show that the Escherichia coli (E. coli) helper strain M13cp combined with a miniphage genome carrying only an f1 origin and a {beta}-lactamase-encoding (bla) antibiotic resistance gene enables the production of pure cssDNA with a minimum sequence genomic length of 1,676 nt directly from bacteria, without the need for additional purification from contaminating dsDNA, genomic DNA, or fragmented DNAs. Low-cost scalability of isogenic, custom-length cssDNA is also demonstrated for a sequence of 2,520 nt using a commercial bioreactor. We apply this system to generate cssDNA for the programmed self-assembly of wireframe DNA origami objects with exonuclease-resistant, custom-designed circular scaffolds that are purified with low endotoxin levels (<5 E.U./ml) for therapeutic applications. We also encode digital information that is stored on the genome with application to write-once, read-many archival data storage.",

We examined the energetic interaction between Ca2+ binding and VSD activation measuring and analyzing the effects of internal Ca2+ on BK channels gating currents. Our results indicate that the Ca2+ sensors occupancy has a strong impact on the VSD activation through a coordinated interaction mechanism in which Ca2+ binding to a single -subunit affects all VSDs equally. Moreover, the two distinct high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites contained in the C-terminus domains, RCK1 and RCK2, appear to contribute equally to decrease the free energy necessary to activate the VSD. We conclude that voltage-dependent gating and pore opening in BK channels is modulated to a great extent by the interaction between Ca2+ sensors and VSDs.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila embryogenesis begins with nuclear division in a common cytoplasm forming a syncytial cell. Morphogen gradient molecules spread across nucleo-cytoplasmic domains to pattern the body axis of the syncytial embryo. The diffusion of molecules across the syncytial nucleo-cytoplasmic domains is potentially constrained by association with the components of cellular architecture, however the extent of restriction has not been examined so far. Here we use photoactivation (PA) to generate a source of cytoplasmic or cytoskeletal molecules in order to monitor the kinetics of their spread in the syncytial Drosophila embryo. Photoactivated PA-GFP and PA-GFP-Tubulin within a fixed anterior area diffused along the antero-posterior axis. These molecules were enriched in cortical cytoplasm above the yolk-filled center suggesting that the cortical cytoplasm is phase separated from the yolk-filled center. The length scales of diffusion were extracted using exponential fits under steady state assumptions. PA-GFP spread to greater distance as compared to PA-GFP-Tubulin. Both gradients were steeper and more restricted when generated in the center of the embryo probably due to a higher density of nucleo-cytoplasmic domains. The length scale of diffusion for PA-GFP-Tubulin gradient increased in mutant embryos containing short plasma membrane furrows and disrupted tubulin cytoskeleton. The PA-GFP gradient shape was unaffected by cyto-architecture perturbation. Taken together, these data show that PA-GFP-Tubulin gradient is largely restricted by its incorporation in the microtubule network and intact plasma membrane furrows. This photoactivation based analysis of protein spread across allows for interpretation of the dependence of gradient formation on the syncytial cyto-architecture.",

    "abstract": "Environmental factors challenge the physiological homeostasis in animals, thereby evoking stress responses. Various mechanisms have evolved to counter stress at the organism level, including regulation by neuropeptides. In recent years, much progress has been made on the mechanisms and neuropeptides that regulate responses to metabolic/nutritional stress, as well as those involved in countering osmotic and ionic stresses. Here, we identified a peptidergic pathway that links these types of regulatory functions. We uncover the neuropeptide Corazonin (Crz), previously implicated in responses to metabolic stress, as a neuroendocrine factor that inhibits the release of a diuretic hormone, CAPA, and thereby modulates the tolerance to osmotic and ionic stress. Both knockdown of Crz and acute injections of Crz peptide impact desiccation tolerance and recovery from chill-coma. Mapping of the Crz receptor (CrzR) expression identified three pairs of Capa-expressing neurons (Va neurons) in the ventral nerve cord that mediate these effects of Crz. We show that Crz acts to restore water/ion homeostasis by inhibiting release of CAPA neuropeptides via inhibition of cAMP production in Va neurons. Knockdown of CrzR in Va neurons affects CAPA signaling, and consequently increases tolerance for desiccation, ionic stress and starvation, but delays chill-coma recovery. Optogenetic activation of Va neurons stimulates excretion and simultaneous activation of Crz and CAPA-expressing neurons reduces this response, supporting the inhibitory action of Crz. Thus, Crz inhibits Va neurons to maintain osmotic and ionic homeostasis, which in turn affects stress tolerance. Earlier work demonstrated that systemic Crz signaling restores nutrient levels by promoting food search and feeding. Here we additionally propose that Crz signaling also ensures osmotic homeostasis by inhibiting release of CAPA neuropeptides and suppressing diuresis. Thus, Crz ameliorates stress-associated physiology through systemic modulation of both peptidergic neurosecretory cells and the fat body in Drosophila.\n\nAuthor summaryInsects are among the largest groups of animals and have adapted to inhabit almost all environments on Earth. Their success in surviving extreme conditions stems largely from their ability to withstand environmental stress, such as desiccation and cold. However, the neural mechanisms that are responsible for coordinating responses to counter these stresses are largely unknown. To address this, we delineate a neuroendocrine axis utilizing the neuropeptides Corazonin (Crz) and CAPA, that coordinate responses to metabolic and osmotic stress. We show that Crz inhibits the release of a diuretic peptide, CAPA from a set of neurosecretory cells. CAPA in turn influences osmotic and ionic balance via actions on the Malpighian tubules (the insect analogs of the kidney) and the intestine. Taken together with earlier work, our data suggest that Crz acts to restore metabolic homeostasis at starvation and osmotic homeostasis during desiccation by inhibiting release of the diuretic hormone CAPA. Hence, this work provides a mechanistic understanding of the neuroendocrine mitigation of metabolic and osmotic stress by two peptide systems.",

    "abstract": "We describe a method, termed cryoAPEX, that couples chemical fixation and high pressure freezing of cells with peroxidase-tagging (APEX) to allow precise localization of membrane proteins in the context of a well-preserved subcellular membrane architecture. Further, cryoAPEX is compatible with electron tomography. As an example, we apply cryoAPEX to obtain a high-resolution three-dimensional contextual map of the human Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) protein, HYPE/FicD. HYPE is a single pass membrane protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and regulates the unfolded protein response. Alternate cellular locations for HYPE have been suggested. CryoAPEX analysis shows that, under normal/resting conditions, HYPE localizes robustly within the subdomains of the ER and is not detected in the secretory pathway or other organelles. CryoAPEX is broadly applicable for assessing both lumenal and cytosol-facing membrane proteins.\\n\\nSummary statementCryoAPEX couples localization of peroxidase-tagged membrane proteins at high-resolution with 3D structural analysis, within an optimally preserved cellular context.",

    "abstract": "In all eutherian mammals, growth of the fetus is dependent upon a functional placenta, but whether and how the latter adapts to putative fetal signals is currently unknown. Here we demonstrate, through fetal, endothelial, hematopoietic and trophoblast-specific genetic manipulations in the mouse, that endothelial and fetus-derived IGF2 is required for the continuous expansion of the feto-placental microvasculature in late pregnancy. The effects of IGF2 on placental microvasculature expansion are mediated, in part, through IGF2R and angiopoietin-Tie2/TEK signalling. Additionally, IGF2 exerts IGF2R-ERK1/2-dependent pro-proliferative and angiogenic effects on primary feto-placental endothelial cells ex vivo. Endothelial and fetus-derived IGF2 also plays an important role in trophoblast morphogenesis, acting through Gcm1 and Synb. Thus, our study reveals a direct role for the imprinted Igf2-Igf2r axis on matching placental development to fetal growth and establishes the principle that hormone-like signals from the fetus play important roles in controlling placental microvasculature and trophoblast morphogenesis.",

The process of experimentally charac-terizing protein residues that contribute the most to protein-protein interaction affin-ity and specificity is laborious. Thus, developing models that accurately characterize hotspots at protein-protein interfaces provides important information about how to inhibit therapeutically relevant protein-protein interactions. During the course of the ICERM WiSDM workshop 2017, we combined the KFC2a protein-protein interaction hotspot prediction features with Rosetta scoring function terms and interface filter metrics. A 2-way and 3-way forward selection strategy was employed to train support vector machine classifiers, as was a reverse feature elimination strategy. From these results, we identified subsets of KFC2a and Rosetta combined features that show improved performance over KFC2a features alone.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) underlie almost all electrical signaling in the body1. They change their open probability in response to changes in transmembrane voltage, allowing permeant ions to flow across the cell membrane. Ion flow through VGICs underlies numerous physiological processes in excitable cells1. In particular, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which operate at the threshold of excitability, are essential for pacemaking activity, resting membrane potential, and synaptic integration2. VGICs contain a series of positively-charged residues that are displaced in response to changes in transmembrane voltage, resulting in a conformational change that opens the pore3-6. These voltage-sensing charges, which reside in the S4 transmembrane helix of the voltage-sensor domain (VSD)3 and within the membranes electric field, are thought to move towards the inside of the cell (downwards) during membrane hyperpolarization7. HCN channels are unique among VGICs because their open probability is increased by membrane hyperpolarization rather than depolarization8-10. The mechanism underlying this \\\"reverse gating\\\" is still unclear. Moreover, although many X-ray crystal and cryo-EM structures have been solved for the depolarized state of the VSD, including that of HCN channels11, no structures have been solved at hyperpolarized voltages. Here we measure the precise movement of the charged S4 helix of an HCN channel using transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tmFRET). We show that the S4 undergoes a significant (~10 [A]) downward movement in response to membrane hyperpolarization. Furthermore, by applying constraints determined from tmFRET experiments to Rosetta modeling, we reveal that the carboxyl-terminal part of the S4 helix exhibits an unexpected tilting motion during hyperpolarization activation. These data provide a long-sought glimpse of the hyperpolarized state of a functioning VSD and also a framework for understanding the dynamics of reverse gating in HCN channels. Our methods can be broadly applied to probe short-distance rearrangements in other ion channels and membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) is a potentially promising strategy for heart regeneration. Yet a major challenge is the low conversion rate. To address this challenge, we screened and identified four chemicals, insulin-like growth factor-1, Mll1 inhibitor MM589, transforming growth factor-{beta} inhibitor A83-01, and Bmi1 inhibitor PTC-209, termed as IMAP, that coordinately enhanced reprogramming efficiency.\\n\\nUsing -muscle heavy chain -green fluorescent protein mouse embryo fibroblasts as the staring cell type, we observed a six-fold increase of iCM formation with IMAP treatment. IMAP stimulated higher cardiac troponin T and -actinin expression and more sarcomere formation with up-regulation of many cardiac genes and down-regulation of fibroblast genes. Furthermore, IMAP promoted higher spontaneous beating and calcium transient activities of iCMs derived from neonatal cardiac fibroblasts. Intriguingly, we identified that many genes involved in immune responses, particularly those in specific C-C chemokine signaling pathways, were repressed with IMAP treatment. We next tested C-C chemokine ligands Ccl3, Ccl6, and Ccl17 in cardiac reprogramming and observed inhibitory effect on iCM formation, while corresponding inhibitors of Ccr1, Ccr4, and Ccr5 had the opposite effect. These results indicated that suppression of specific C-C chemokine signaling pathways was a direct down-stream event of IMAP treatment that enhanced cardiac reprogramming.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we identified a combination of four chemicals IMAP in suppressing specific C-C chemokine signaling pathways and facilitating MGT-induced cardiac reprogramming. Our studies revealed the role of these specific C-C chemokine signaling pathways in cardiac reprogramming and provide potential targets in iCM formation and its clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "An efficient gene editing technique for use in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) would have great potential value in regenerative medicine, as well as in drug discovery based on isogenic human disease models. However, the extremely low efficiency of gene editing in hPSCs is a major technical hurdle that remains to be resolved. Previously, we demonstrated that YM155, a survivin inhibitor developed as an anti-cancer drug, induces highly selective cell death in undifferentiated hPSCs. In this study, we demonstrated that the high cytotoxicity of YM155 in hPSCs, which is mediated by selective cellular uptake of the drug, is due to high expression of SLC35F2 in these cells. Consistent with this, knockout of SLC35F2 with CRISPR-Cas9 or depletion with siRNAs made hPSCs highly resistant to YM155. Simultaneous gene editing of a gene of interest and transient knockdown of SLC35F2 following YM155 treatment enabled genome-edited hPSCs to survive because YM155 resistance was temporarily induced, thereby achieving enriched selection of genome-edited clonal populations. This precise and efficient genome editing approach took as little as 3 weeks without cell sorting or introduction of additional genes.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are the primary excitatory postsynaptic sites that act as subcompartments of signaling. Ca2+ is often the first and most rapid signal in spines. Downstream of calcium, the cAMP/PKA pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of spine formation, morphological modifications, and ultimately, learning and memory. While the dynamics of calcium are reasonably well-studied, calcium-induced cAMP/PKA dynamics, particularly with respect to frequency modulation, are not fully explored. In this study, we present a well-mixed model for the dynamics of calcium-induced cAMP/PKA dynamics in dendritic spines. The model is constrained using experimental observations in the literature. Further, we measured the calcium oscillation frequency in dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal CA1 neurons and used these dynamics as model inputs. Our model predicts that the various steps in this pathway act as frequency modulators for calcium and the high frequency of calcium input is filtered by AC1 and PDEs in this pathway such that cAMP/PKA only responds to lower frequencies. This prediction has important implications for noise filtering and long-timescale signal transduction in dendritic spines. A companion manuscript presents a three-dimensional spatial model for the same pathway.\\n\\nStatement of SignificancecAMP/PKA activity triggered by calcium is an essential biochemical pathway for synaptic plasticity, regulating spine structure, and long-term potentiation. In the current study, we predicted that for a given calcium input, AC1, and PDE1 kinetics reflect both the high and the low frequencies with different amplitudes and cAMP/PKA acts as a leaky integrator of calcium because of frequency attenuation by the intermediary steps. These findings have implications for cAMP/PKA signaling in dendritic spines in particular and neuronal signal transduction in general.",

    "abstract": "A reciprocal communication between the implantation-competent blastocyst and the receptive uterus is essential to implantation. Blastocyst implantation is considered to be a regulated proinflammatory response in the uterus, however the underlining mechanism remains elusive. Here, we provide genetic evidence that High-mobility group protein Box-1 (HMGB1), expressed in uterine cell nuclei, restricts inflammatory responses during the periimplantation period. Conditional deletion of uterine Hmgb1 by using a Pgr-Cre driver (Pgrcre/+Hmgb1f/f) shows substantial infertility because of defective implantation and subsequent adverse ripple effects. These mice accumulate and retain an increased number of macrophages in the stroma on day 4 of pregnancy with a unique enrichment of macrophages in the stroma encircling the blastocyst on day 5, evoking inflammatory responses. These results are in contrast to previous findings that HMBG1 is an internal alarmin. In search for the mechanism, we found that Hmgb1-deleted stromal cells show reduced activation of PR and decreased Hoxa10 expression, providing evidence that PR and Hoxa10 mediated regression of inflammation is mediated by HMGB1. In addition, levels of two macrophage attractants CSF1 and CCL2 are elevated in the stroma and in vitro studies show that CSF1 specifically attracts macrophages which is abrogated if challenged with a CSF1 receptor antagonist. The results suggest that Hmgb1 contributes to successful blastocyst implantation by regulating macrophage trafficking in the stroma to prevent excessive inflammatory responses.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi complex is part of the endomembrane system and is responsible for receiving transport cargos from the endoplasmic reticulum and for sorting and targeting them to their final destination. To perform its function in higher eukaryotic cells, the Golgi needs to be correctly assembled as a flatted membrane sandwich kept together by a protein matrix. The correct mechanism controlling the Golgi cisternae assembly is not yet known, but it is already accepted that the Golgi Reassembly and Stacking Protein (GRASP) is a main component of the Golgi protein matrix. Unlike mammalian cells, which have two GRASP genes, lower eukaryotes present only one gene and distinct Golgi cisternae assembly. In this study, we performed a set of biophysical studies to get insights on both human GRASP55 and GRASP65 and compare them with GRASPs from lower eukaryotes (S. cerevisiae and C. neoformans). Our data suggest that both human GRASPs are essentially different from each other and GRASP65 is more similar to the subgroup of GRASPs from lower eukaryotes. GRASP55 is present mainly in the Golgi medial and trans faces, which are absent in both funguses, while GRASP65 is located in the cis-Golgi. We suggest that the GRASP65 gene is more ancient and the paralogue GRASP55 might have appeared latter in evolution, together with the medial and trans Golgi faces in mammalians.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic stem (ES) cells are regulated by a network of transcription factors which maintain the pluripotent state. Differentiation relies on downregulation of pluripotency transcription factors disrupting this network. While investigating transcriptional regulation of the pluripotency transcription factor Klf4, we observed homozygous deletion of distal enhancers caused 17 fold decrease in Klf4 transcript but surprisingly decreased protein levels by less than 2 fold indicating post-transcriptional control of KLF4 protein overrides transcriptional control. The lack of sensitivity of KLF4 to transcription is due to high protein stability (half-life >24hr). This stability is context dependent and disrupted during differentiation, evidenced by a shift to a half-life of <2hr. KLF4 protein stability is maintained through interaction with other pluripotency transcription factors (NANOG, SOX2 and STAT3) that together facilitate association of KLF4 with RNA polymerase II. In addition, the KLF4 DNA binding and transactivation domains are required for optimal KLF4 protein stability. Post-translational modification of KLF4 destabilizes the protein as cells exit the pluripotent state and mutations that prevent this destabilization also prevent differentiation. These data indicate the core pluripotency transcription factors are integrated by post-translational mechanisms to maintain the pluripotent state, and identify mutations that increase KLF4 protein stability while maintaining transcription factor function.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is a group of disorders associated with retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and death. There is a clear contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress toward glaucomatous RGC death. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) is a well-known regulator of oxidative stress that increases cell survival in acute models of oxidative damage. The impact of Ucp2 on cell survival during sub-acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions however is not yet clear. Herein, we test the hypothesis that increased Ucp2 expression will improve retinal ganglion cell survival in a mouse model of glaucoma. We show that increasing retinal ganglion cell but not glial Ucp2 expression in transgenic animals decreases glaucomatous RGC death, but also that the PPAR-{gamma} agonist rosiglitazone, an endogenous transcriptional activator of Ucp2, does not significantly alter RGC loss during glaucoma. Together, these data support a model whereby increased Ucp2 expression mediates neuroprotection during a long-term oxidative stressor, but that transcriptional activation alone is insufficient to elicit a neuroprotective effect, motivating further research in to the post-transcriptional regulation of Ucp2.",

    "abstract": "Numerous cellular processes, including enzyme behaviour, signalling, and protein folding and transport are highly influenced by the local microviscosity environment within living cells. Molecular rotors are fluorescent molecules that respond to the viscosity of their environment through changes in both the intensity and lifetime of their fluorescence. We have synthesised a novel benzyl-guanine derivatized boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) molecular rotor that is a substrate for the SNAP-tag targeting system (named BG-BODIPY), allowing us to target the rotor to discrete locations within the living cell. We demonstrate that BG-BODIPY reports viscosity, and that this can be measured either through fluorescence lifetime or intensity ratiometric measurements. The relative microviscosities within the ER, Golgi, mitochondrial matrix, peroxisomes, lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm were significantly different. Additionally, this approach permitted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the absolute viscosity within both mitochondria and stress granules, showcasing BG-BODIPYs usefulness in studying both membrane-bound and membraneless organelles. These results highlight targeted BG-BODIPYs broad usefulness for making measurements of cellular viscosity both with FLIM and conventional ratiometric confocal microscopy, the latter option greatly extending the accessibility of the technique although limited to relative meassurements.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLocal viscosity affects molecular behaviour from diffusion and conformational changes to enzyme kinetics and has important implications for cell and tissue function. Mechanical methods for measurement of viscosity average over large volumes and long times and are thus unsuitable for rapid changes on small scales that are biologically relevant. This paper reports a novel optical fluorescence method using genome edited cells to deliver a viscosity reporter to tightly defined locations inside living cells, from which non-destructive organelle-specific measurements can be repeatedly made. The local viscosity of seven separate organelles in living cultured human cells is shown for the first time, together with the viscosity behaviour of a membraneless organelle as it is induced in cells by stress.",
