    "abstract": "Adaptation and survival in fluctuating environments is an evolutionary challenge faced by organisms. Epigenetic switches (bistable, molecular systems built from self-reinforcing feedback loops) have been suggested as a mechanism of bet-hedging and adaptation to fluctuating environments. These epigenetic systems are capable of spontaneously switching between phenotypes in the absence of DNA mutation and these phenotypes are stably inherited through multiple cell generations. The extent to which epigenetic switches outcompete adaptation through genetic mutation in fluctuating environments remains unexplored. To better understand the conditions that select for epigenetic switching, we used computer simulation to evolve a mechanistic model of a self-activating genetic circuit, which can adapt genetically and exhibit epigenetic switching. We evolved this model in a fluctuating environment under different selection pressures, mutation step-sizes, population sizes, and fluctuation frequencies. There was a trade-off between minimizing the adaptation time after each environmental transition and increasing the robustness of the phenotype during the constant environment between transitions. We show that surviving lineages evolved bistable, epigenetic switching to adapt quickly in fast fluctuating environments, whereas genetic adaptation was favored in slowly fluctuating environments. For some evolutionary conditions, a strategy emerged where the population adapted genetically between two bistable genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity relies on new protein synthesis in dendrites that involves the selective translation of specific mRNAs. This requires a tight control of mRNA levels in dendrites. Consistently, RNA translation and degradation pathways have been recently linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases, suggesting a role for RNA regulation in synaptic plasticity and cognition. Despite being the only RNA regulatory pathway that is associated with multiple mental illnesses, the Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) pathway presents an unexplored regulatory mechanism for synaptic function and plasticity. NMD is a highly conserved and selective RNA degradation pathway that exerts its function in a cell- and spatiotemporally-specific manner. Here, we show that neuron-specific disruption of NMD in adulthood attenuates learning, memory, hippocampal LTP, and potentiates perseverative/repetitive behavior. While it is known that local translation of specific mRNAs in dendrites enables synaptic plasticity, the tightly-controlled mechanisms that regulate local quantity of specific mRNAs remains poorly understood. We report that the NMD pathway operates within dendrites to regulate GluR1 surface levels. Specifically, NMD modulates the internalization of GluR1 and promotes its local synthesis in dendrites. We identified AMPK as a mechanistic substrate for NMD that contributes to the NMD-mediated regulation of GluR1 by limiting total GluR1 levels. These data establish that NMD regulates synaptic plasticity, cognition, and local protein synthesis in dendrites, providing fundamental insight into the neuron-specific function of NMD within the brain.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomic profiling is an immensly powerful hypothesis generating tool. Whether one is comparing an experimental versus control condition or collecting transcriptomes from cohorts of disease tissue, it is often necessary to determine which transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors drive programs of gene expression in the datasets. Most available tools rely on searching for TF binding motifs near promoters of genes in a gene set. This approach can work well for TFs with extended recognition elements but is less useful for shorter elements and does not work at all for cofactors. The Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) archives ChIPseq tracks of 169 TFs and cofactors assayed in 91 cells lines. The algorithm presented herein, Multiple Aligned Genomic Integration of ChIP (MAGIC), uses ENCODE ChIPseq data to look for statistical enrichment of TFs and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene sets. When compared to a commonly used web resource o-Possum, MAGIC was able to more accurately predict TFs and cofactors that drive gene changes in 3 settings: 1) A cell line expressing or lacking REST, 2) Breast tumors divided along PAM50 designations and 3) Whole brain samples from WT mice or mice lacking CTCF in a particular neuronal subtype. In summary, MAGIC is a standalone application that runs on OSX machines and has a simple interface that produces meaningful predictions of which TFs and cofactors are enriched in a gene set.",

    "abstract": "The acai berrys seed corresponds to 85-95% of the fruits weight and represents ~1.1 million tons of residue yearly accumulated in the Amazon region. This study confirmed that mannan is the major component of mature seeds, corresponding to 80% of the seeds total carbohydrates and about 50% of its dry weight. To convert this high mannan content into mannose, a sequential process of diluted acid and enzymatic hydrolysis was evaluated. Diluted-H2SO4 hydrolysis (3%-acid, 60-min, 121{degrees}C) resulted in a 30% mannan hydrolysis yield and 41.7 g/L of mannose. Because ~70% mannan remained in the seed, a mannanase-catalyzed hydrolysis was sequentially performed with 2-20% seed concentration, reaching 146.3 g/L of mannose and a 96.8% yield with 20% solids. As far as we know, this is the highest reported concentration of mannose produced from a residue.

    "abstract": "Identification of the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that regulate gene expression in specific cell types is critical for defining the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control normal physiology and disease states. We previously utilized non-coding RNA (ncRNA) profiling to define CREs that comprise a GRN in the adult mouse heart1. Here, we applied ncRNA profiling to the mouse retina in the presence and absence of Nrl, a rod photoreceptor-specific transcription factor required for rod versus cone photoreceptor cell fate. Differential expression of Nrl-dependent ncRNAs positively correlated with differential expression of Nrl-dependent local genes. Two distinct Nrl-dependent regulatory networks were discerned in parallel: Nrl-activated ncRNAs were enriched for accessible chromatin in rods but not cones whereas Nrl-repressed ncRNAs were enriched for accessible chromatin in cones but not rods. Furthermore, differential Nrl-dependent ncRNA expression levels quantitatively correlated with photoreceptor cell type-specific ATAC-seq read density. Direct assessment of Nrl-dependent ncRNA-defined loci identified functional cone photoreceptor CREs. This work supports differential ncRNA profiling as a platform for identifying context-specific regulatory elements and provides insight into the networks that define photoreceptor cell types.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila species communicate the presence of parasitoid wasps to naive individuals. This observation suggests a rudimentary Drosophila social structure. Communication between closely related species is efficient, while more distantly related species exhibit a dampened, partial communication. Partial communication between some species is enhanced following a period of cohabitation, suggesting that species-specific variations in communication \"dialects\" can be learned through social interactions. However, it remains unclear as to how the behavioral acquisition and how learning dialects is facilitated by distinct brain regions. In this study, we have identified six regions of the Drosophila brain essential for dialect learning, including the odorant receptor Or69a. Furthermore, we pinpoint subgroups of neurons such as motion detecting neurons in the optic lobe, layer 5 of the fan-shaped body, and the D glomerulus in the antennal lobe, where activation of each are necessary for dialect learning. These results demonstrate that Drosophila can display complex social behaviors with inputs to multiple regions of the Drosophila brain and unique subsets of neurons that must integrate olfactory, visual and motion cues.",

    "abstract": "Stable localization of the Rheb GTPase to lysosomes is thought to be required for activation of mTORC1 signaling. However, the lysosome targeting mechanisms for Rheb remain unclear. We therefore investigated the relationship between Rheb subcellular localization and mTORC1 activation. Surprisingly, we found that although Rheb was prominently enriched at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Rheb was undetectable at lysosomes. Functional assays in knockout human cells revealed that farnesylation of the C-terminal CaaX motif on Rheb was essential for both Rheb enrichment on ER membranes and mTORC1 activation. However, constitutively targeting Rheb to ER membranes did not support mTORC1 activation. Further systematic analysis of the Rheb hypervariable region revealed that weak, non-selective, farnesylation-dependent, membrane interactions confer Rheb function without the need for a specific lysosome targeting motif. Collectively, these results argue against stable interactions of Rheb with lysosomes and instead that transient membrane interactions optimally allow Rheb to activate mTORC1 signaling.",

This is challenging because local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are trait-dependent and traits co-vary along climatic gradients, with differential consequences for fitness. Our aim is to quantify local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of vertical and radial growth, leaf flushing and survival across Fagus sylvatica range and to estimate each trait contribution to explain the species occurrence.\\n\\nLocationEurope\\n\\nTime period1995 - 2014; 2070\\n\\nMajor taxa studiedFagus sylvatica L.\\n\\nMethodsWe used vertical and radial growth, flushing phenology and mortality of Fagus sylvatica L. recorded in BeechCOSTe52 (>150,000 trees). Firstly, we performed linear mixed-effect models that related trait variation and co-variation to local adaptation (related to the planted populations climatic origin) and phenotypic plasticity (accounting for the climate of the plantation), and we made spatial predictions under current and RCP 8.5 climates. Secondly, we combined spatial trait predictions in a linear model to explain the occurrence of the species.\\n\\nResultsThe contribution of plasticity to intra-specific trait variation is always higher than that of local adaptation, suggesting that the species is less sensitive to climate change than expected; different traits constrain beechs distribution in different parts of its range: the northernmost edge is mainly delimited by flushing phenology (mostly driven by photoperiod and temperature), the southern edge by mortality (mainly driven by intolerance to drought), and the eastern edge is characterised by decreasing radial growth (mainly shaped by precipitation-related variables in our model); considering trait co-variation improved single-trait predictions.\\n\\nMain conclusionsPopulation responses to climate across large geographical gradients are trait-dependent, indicating that multi-trait combinations are needed to understand species sensitivity to climate change and its variation across distribution ranges.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the ResearchThe wide diversity of floral traits seen among plants is shaped by neutral and selective evolutionary processes. In outcrossing species, sexual selection from competing pollen donors is expected to be important for shaping mating system-related traits but empirical evidence is scarce. In a previous evaluation of experimental evolution lines crossed with either one or two pollen donors (monogamous, M, or polyandrous, P, lines) at early floral stages in mixed-mating Collinsia heterophylla (Plantaginaceae), P showed enhanced pollen competitive ability and reduced maternal seed set compared to M, in accordance with sexually antagonistic evolution of pollen. Here, we asked whether the presence of sexual selection during pollen competition affect mating system-related floral traits in the same lines.\\n\\nMethodologyWe compared flowering start, timing of anther-stigma contact (as an indication of timing of self-pollination), timing of stigma receptivity and first seed set between M and P, and with a source line, S (starting material). The former three traits are later in outcrossers than in selfers of Collinsia. The latter trait was expected to be earlier in P than in M because of sexual selection for early seed siring of pollen.\\n\\nPivotal ResultsArtificial polyandry for four generations resulted in later flowering start and later anther-stigma contact in P compared to M, and the latter trait was intermediate in S. Thus, P appeared more  outcrossing than M. Stigma receptivity did not differ between lines. First seed set was earlier in P than in M, as expected from sexual selection.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results from C. heterophylla experimental evolution lines suggest that a component of sexual selection during outcross pollination could enhance the patterns of floral divergence commonly found between outcrossers and selfers.",

Circulating miRNAs serve as a new class of disease biomarkers. Nevertheless, the functional roles of miRNAs, particularly extracellular miRNAs, in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to link changes in extracellular miRNAs to lymphocyte gene regulation and the pathophysiology of SLE. Here, we demonstrate that circulating miR-22-3p levels are associated with SLE, and miR-22-3p regulates T and B cell function and SLE-associated kidney disease. Based on high-throughput small RNA sequencing and real-time PCR, extracellular miR-22-3p levels were found to be significantly increased in whole plasma in human SLE subjects. To determine the functional impact of miR-22-3p in SLE, miR-22-3p loss-of-function studies were performed in a mouse model of SLE (B6.SLE1.2.3). We found that in vivo administration of locked-nucleic acid inhibitors of miR-22-3p (LNA-22) reduced lymphocyte accumulation in both the spleen and lymph nodes compared to LNA scramble (LNA-Scr) control-treated mice. Strikingly, LNA-22-3p treatments reduced kidney disease pathology and glomerular IgG deposition compared to LNA-Scr treatments in SLE mice. Moreover, miR-22-3p inhibition reduced the proportion of T effector memory IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ T cells, suggesting that miR-22-3p regulates Th1 T cell differentiation. We also found that miR-22 inhibition in mice reduced STAT1 phosphorylation in the kidney which was correlated with loss of IFN-{gamma} production by splenic CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that miR-22-3p is a critical regulator of SLE-associated CD4+ T cell immunity and kidney disease.

Under high particulate matter (PM) polluted episodes, bacterial aerosols were detected to have a viability up to 50-70% in the 0.56-1 m size range, at which elevated levels of SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ were concurrently observed. Engineered or acclimated for both pharmaceuticals and wastewater treatment, bacteria such as Psychrobacter spp., Massilia spp., Acinetobacter lwoffii, Exiguobacterium aurantiacum, and Bacillus megaterium were shown to have experienced massive abundance shifts in polluted air on early mornings and late afternoons, on which were previously reported to witness rapid new particle formation events. For example, Acinetobacter spp. were shown to account for > 96% abundance at a corresponding PM2.5 level of 208 ng/m3. The bacterial aerosol changes corresponded to the observed PM2.5 mass peak shift from 3.2-5.6 m to the high viability size range of 0.56-1m. Additionally, it is interesting that elevated levels of soluble Na, Ca, Mg, K, Al, Fe and P elements that are required for bacterial growth were observed to co-occur with those significant bacterial aerosol structure shifts in the air. For particular time-resolved PM2.5 pollution episodes, Acinetobacter and Massilia were shown to alternate in dominating the time-resolved aerosol community structures. The results from a HYSPLIT trajectory model simulation suggested that the role by air mass transport in affecting the observed bacterial aerosol dynamics could be minor. As an evidence, we found that Acinetobacter, Psychrobacter, Exiguobacterium, and Bacillus genera were emitted into the air with a level of > 3000 CFU/m3 from a pharmaceutical plant. In addition, high level of VOCs up to 15,030 ppbv, mainly Acetone (61%) and Acetaldehyde (11%), were also detected in the air inside the plant. All the data including size-resolved viability and time-resolved bacterial aerosol dynamics together with their growth conditions detected in the air suggested that airborne bacteria in the size range of 0.56- 1m could have played important roles for haze formation in Beijing. The results about time- and size-resolved bacterial aerosol dynamics from this work provide a fresh understanding of aerosol chemistry especially in highly polluted air. It is hoped that these findings could lend a support in future cost-effective air pollution control practices.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the multi-drug resistant (MDR) and {beta}-lactamases producing EPEC isolated from children with diarrhea. Twenty two EPEC strains were gathered from another study performed from September to November 2009. Antibiotic susceptibilities against 20 antibiotics determined by the agar disk diffusion according to the protocol recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI). Phenotypic confirmatory tests carried out for screening of ESBLs and AmpC {beta}-lactamase. The isolates subjected to PCR assays with specific primers for bla-genes (blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M and blaOXA, blaPER, blaVEB and blaGES). Only 22 (3.4%) EPEC isolates recovered from clinical infections. MDR rate in EPEC was 90.9%. Phenotypic confirmatory tests showed that 13.6% and 20.0% of isolates were ESBL and AmpC {beta}-lactamase producers, respectively. Among the EPEC isolates, percent recovery of blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M and blaOXA genes was 100%, 81.8%, 77.3% and 9.1%, respectively. Only 2 (9.1%) isolates had blaAmpC gene and none of the isolates carried blaPER, blaVEB and blaGES genes. The results of our study showed that the ESBLs were common among EPEC isolates. Such high dissemination of ESBLs is a serious problem for public health and therefore, it is necessary to seek a program for monitoring ESBLs in Najaf hospitals. This study is the first report on the presence of the bla-genes in EPEC isolates in Najaf.",

    "abstract": "Neural computation, which relies on the active storage and sharing of information, occurs within large neuron networks in the highly dynamic context of varying brain states. Whether such functions are performed by specific subsets of neurons and whether they occur in specific dynamical regimes remain poorly understood. Using high density recordings in the hippocampus, medial entorhinal and medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, we identify computing microstates, or discreet epochs, in which specific computing hub neurons perform well defined storage and sharing operations in a brain state-dependent manner. We retrieve a multiplicity of distinct computing microstates within each global brain state, such as REM and nonREM sleep. Half of recorded neurons act as computing hubs in at least one microstate, suggesting that functional roles are not firmly hardwired but dynamically reassigned at the second timescale. We identify sequences of microstates whose temporal organization is dynamic and stands between order and disorder. We propose that global brain states constrain the language of neuronal computations by regulating the syntactic complexity of these microstate sequences.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn the last few years, the error rates of third generation sequencing data have been capped above 5%, including many insertions and deletions. Thereby, an increasing number of long reads correction methods have been proposed to reduce the noise in these sequences. Whether hybrid or self-correction methods, there exist multiple approaches to correct long reads. As the quality of the error correction has huge impacts on downstream processes, developing methods allowing to evaluate error correction tools with precise and reliable statistics is therefore a crucial need. Since error correction is often a resource bottleneck in long reads pipelines, a key feature of assessment methods is therefore to be efficient, in order to allow the fast comparison of different tools.\n\nResultsWe propose ELECTOR, a reliable and efficient tool to evaluate long reads correction, that enables the evaluation of hybrid and self-correction methods. Our tool provides a complete and relevant set of metrics to assess the read quality improvement after correction and scales to large datasets. ELECTOR is directly compatible with a wide range of state-of-the-art error correction tools, using whether simulated or real long reads. We show that ELECTOR displays a wider range of metrics than the state-of-the-art tool, LRCstats, and additionally importantly decreases the runtime needed for assessment on all the studied datasets.\n\nAvailabilityELECTOR is available at https://github.com/kamimrcht/ELECTOR.\n\nContactcamille.marchet@univ-lille.fr or pierre.morisse2@univ-rouen.fr",

    "abstract": "In evolutionary genomics, researchers have taken an interest in identifying in the genomes substitutions that subtend convergent phenotypic adaptations. This is a difficult question to address, because genomes contain billions of sites, many of which have substituted in the lineages where the adaptations took place, and yet are not linked to them. Those extra substitutions may be linked to other adaptations, may be neutral, or may be linked to mutational biases. Furthermore, one can think of various ways of defining substitutions of interest, and various methods that match those definitions have been used, resulting in different sets of candidate substitutions. In this manuscript we first clarify how adaptation to convergent phenotypic evolution can manifest itself in coding sequences. Second, we review methods that have been proposed to detect convergent adaptive evolution in coding sequences and expose the assumptions that underlie them. Finally, we examine their power on simulations of convergent changes, including in the presence of a confounding factor.",

    "abstract": "Many organs, such as the gut or the spine are formed through folding of an epithelium. This change in shape is usually attributed to tissue heterogeneities, for example, local apical contraction. In contrast, compressive stresses have been proposed to fold a homogeneous epithelium by buckling. While buckling is an appealing mechanism, demonstrating that it underlies folding requires to measure the stress field and the material properties of the tissue, which is currently inaccessible in vivo. Here we show that monolayers of identical cells proliferating on the inner surface of elastic spherical shells can spontaneously fold. By measuring the elastic deformation of the shell, we infer the forces acting within the monolayer and its elastic modulus. Using analytical and numerical theories linking forces to shape, we find that buckling quantitatively accounts for the shape changes of our monolayers. Our study shows that forces arising from epithelium growth in three-dimensional confinement are sufficient to drive folding by buckling.",

The essential mitochondrial import protein coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix domain-containing protein 4 (CHCHD4) controls respiratory chain complex activity and oxygen consumption, and regulates the growth of tumours in vivo. In this study we interrogate the role of CHCHD4-regulated respiratory chain activity and metabolism in tumour cell proliferation and EMT-related phenotypes.\\n\\nRESULTSWe show that CHCHD4 is essential for the proliferation of tumour cells irrespective of their aetiology. In human tumours, elevated CHCHD4 expression is correlated with a mitochondrial OXPHOS gene signature and with a proliferative gene signature associated with the mTORC1 signalling pathway. Elevated CHCHD4 increases tumour cell proliferation, in a manner that is dependent on complex I (CI) activity, glutamine consumption and mTORC1 activation. CHCHD4 expression is inversely correlated with EMT gene expression both in vitro and in vivo.

Patients with pathogenic variants in GPI biosynthetic pathway genes display an array of phenotypes including seizures, developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features and cleft palate. There is virtually no mechanism to explain these phenotypes. we identified a novel mouse mutant (cleft lip/palate, edema and exencephaly; Clpex) with a hypomorphic mutation in Post-Glycophosphatidylinositol Attachment to Proteins-2 (Pgap2). Pgap2 is one of the final proteins in the GPI biosynthesis pathway and is required for anchor maturation. We found the Clpex mutation results in a global decrease in surface GPI expression. Surprisingly, Pgap2 showed tissue specific expression with enrichment in the affected tissues of the Clpex mutant. We found the phenotype in Clpex mutants is due to apoptosis of neural crest cells (NCCs) and the cranial neuroepithelium, as is observed in the GPI anchored Folate Receptor 1-/- mouse. We showed folinic acid supplementation in utero can rescue the cleft lip phenotype in Clpex. Finally, we generated a novel mouse model of NCC-specific total GPI deficiency in the Wnt1-Cre lineage. These mutants developed median cleft lip and palate demonstrating a cell autonomous role for GPI biosynthesis in NCC development.",

To evaluate the potential ecological role of these two compounds, we have used a pharmacological approach to characterize homologs of the indolergic receptors Or2 and Or10 in the non-hematophagous elephant mosquito Toxorhynchites amboinensis. We provide evidence that both receptors are narrowly tuned to indole and skatole like their counterparts from hematophagous mosquitoes. These findings indicate that indole and skatole are operating in a non-animal-host seeking context in Toxorhynchites and underscore the importance of understanding their roles in hematophagous mosquitoes.",

As such, mimetic patterns are commonly circumscribed into discrete mimicry complexes each containing a predominant phenotype. Outside a few examples in butterflies, the location of transition zones between mimicry complexes and the factors driving them has rarely been examined. To infer the patterns and processes of Mullerian mimicry, we integrate large-scale data on the geographic distribution of colour patterns of all social bumble bees across the contiguous United States and use these to quantify colour pattern mimicry using an innovative machine learning approach based on computer vision and image recognition. Our data suggests that bumble bees exhibit a manifold of similar, but imperfect colour patterns, that continuously transition across the United States, supporting the idea that mimicry is not discrete. We propose that bumble bees are mimicking a perceptual colour pattern average that is evolutionarily transient. We examine three comimicking polymorphic species, Bombus flavifrons, B. melanopygus, and B. bifarius, where active selection is driving colour pattern frequencies and determine that their colour pattern transition zones differ in location and breadth within a broad region of poor mimicry. Furthermore, we explore factors driving these differences such as mimicry selection dynamics and climate.",

These genomes were closely related, with 99.7% sequence identity. Among the 9,628 orthologous genes, 4.8% showed signs of positive selection in at least one species. Divergent selective trajectories were discovered in conserved chemosensory gene families (IGR, SNMP), and Halloween genes (CYP) involved in moulting and reproduction. However, there was little overlap in these gene sets and associated GO terms, indicating different selective regimes operating on each of the parasites. Based on our findings, we suggest that species-specific strategies may be needed to combat evolving parasite communities.",

Upon induction of Notch, cells go through major transcriptional reprogramming that involves both activation and repression of gene expression. Although much is known about the transcriptional programs activated by Notch, the identity of the genes silenced downstream of Notch signaling and the mechanisms by which Notch down-regulates their expression remain unclear. Here, we show that upon induction of Notch signaling, ICN1-CSL-MAML1 ternary complex assembles a transcriptional Notch Repressive Complex (NRC) containing NuRD and PRC1. Genome wide analysis revealed set of genes bound and transcriptionally repressed by the NRC. Remarkably, among those genes, we found master regulators of cell differentiation and cell proliferation such as PAX5, master B-cell regulator and the DNA-binding transcriptional repressor MAD4. We propose that Notch possesses a dual role as direct activator and repressor by serving as a platform for the recruitment of co-activators and co-repressors on target genes and that both activities are required for Notch nuclear functions.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes rely on the integration of multiple sensory cues, including olfactory, visual, and thermal stimuli, to detect, identify and locate their hosts [1-4]. Although we increasingly know more about the role of chemosensory behaviours in mediating mosquito-host interactions [1], the role of visual cues remains comparatively less studied [3], and how the combination of olfactory and visual information is integrated in the mosquito brain remains unknown. In the present study, we used a tethered-flight LED arena, which allowed for quantitative control over the stimuli, to show that CO2 exposure affects target-tracking responses, but not responses to large-field visual stimuli. In addition, we show that CO2 modulates behavioural responses to visual objects in a time-dependent manner. To gain insight into the neural basis of this olfactory and visual coupling, we conducted two-photon microscopy experiments in a new GCaMP6s-expressing mosquito line. Imaging revealed that the majority of ROIs in the lobula region of the optic lobe exhibited strong responses to small-field stimuli, but showed little response to a large-field stimulus. Approximately 20% of the neurons we imaged were modulated when an attractive odour preceded the visual stimulus; these same neurons also elicited a small response when the odour was presented alone. By contrast, imaging in the antennal lobe revealed no modulation when visual stimuli were presented before or after the olfactory stimulus. Together, our results are the first to reveal the dynamics of olfactory modulation in visually evoked behaviours of mosquitoes, and suggest that coupling between these sensory systems is asymmetrical and time-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Reproducibility in biomedical research, and more specifically in preclinical animal research, has been seriously questioned. Several cases of spectacular failures to replicate findings published in the primary scientific literature have led to a perceived reproducibility crisis. Diverse threats to reproducibility have been proposed, including lack of scientific rigour, low statistical power, publication bias, analytical flexibility and fraud. An important aspect that is generally overlooked is the lack of external validity caused by rigorous standardization of both the animals and the environment. Here, we argue that a reaction norm approach to phenotypic variation, acknowledging gene-by-environment interactions, can help us seeing reproducibility of animal experiments in a new light. We illustrate how dominating environmental effects can affect inference and effect size estimates of studies and how elimination of dominant factors through standardization affects the nature of the expected phenotype variation through the reaction norms of small effect. Finally, we discuss the consequences of reaction norms of small effect for statistical analysis, specifically for random effect latent variable models and the random lab model.",

    "abstract": "Many parasites like the cytomegalovirus, HIV and Escherichia coli are capable to persist in and reinfect its host. The evolutionary advantage (if so) of these complicated mechanisms have not been quantitatively analyzed so far. Here we take a first step by investigating a host-parasite model for which these mechanisms are driving the evolution of the parasite population. We consider two variants of the model. In one variant parasite reproduction is directed by balancing selection, in the other variant parasite reproduction is neutral. In the former scenario reinfection and persistence have been shown to sustain the maintenance of diversity in the parasite population in certain parameter regimes (Pokalyuk and Wakolbinger, 2018). Here we analyse the diversity patterns in the latter, neutral scenario. We evaluate the biological relevance of both model variants with respect to the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), an ancient herpesvirus that is carried by a substantial fraction of mankind and manages to maintain a high diversity in its coding regions.",

However, despite its prevalence and clinical prognostic relevance, the evolutionary selection pressures for WGD have not been investigated. Here, we explored whether WGD may act to mitigate the irreversible, inexorable ratchet-like, accumulation of deleterious mutations in essential genes. Utilizing 1050 tumor regions from 816 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), we temporally dissect mutations to determine their temporal acquisition in relation to WGD. We find evidence for strong negative selection against homozygous loss of essential cancer genes prior to WGD. However, mutations in essential genes occurring after duplication were not subject to significant negative selection, consistent with WGD providing a buffering effect, decreasing the likelihood of homozygous loss. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of heterozygosity and temporal dissection of mutations can be exploited to identify signals of positive selection in lung, breast, colorectal cancer and other cancer types, enabling the elucidation of novel tumour suppressor genes and a deeper characterization of known cancer genes.",

    "abstract": "Global fire regimes are changing, with increases in wildfire frequency and severity expected for many North American forests over the next 100 years. Fires can result in dramatic changes to C stocks and can restructure plant and microbial communities, with long-lasting effects on ecosystem functions. We investigated wildfire effects on soil microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) in an extreme fire season in the northwestern Canadian boreal forest, using field surveys, remote sensing, and high-throughput amplicon sequencing. We found that fire occurrence, along with vegetation community, moisture regime, pH, total carbon, and soil texture are all significant predictors of soil microbial community composition. Communities become increasingly dissimilar with increasingly severe burns, and the burn severity index (an index of the fractional area of consumed organic soils and exposed mineral soils) best predicted total bacterial community composition, while burned/unburned was the best predictor for fungi. Globally abundant taxa were identified as significant positive fire responders, including the bacteria Massilia sp. (64x more abundant with fire) and Arthrobacter sp. (35x), and the fungi Penicillium sp. (22x) and Fusicladium sp. (12x). Bacterial and fungal co-occurrence network modules were characterized by fire responsiveness as well as pH and moisture regime. Building on the efforts of previous studies, our results identify specific fire-responsive microbial taxa and suggest that accounting for burn severity improves our understanding of their response to fires, with potentially important implications for ecosystem function.",

    "abstract": "Interaural time differences (ITD) are one of several principle cues for localizing sounds. However, ITD are in the sub-millisecond range for most animals. Because the neural processing of such small ITDs pushes the limit of temporal resolution, the precise ITD-range for a given species and its usefulness - relative to other localization cues - was a powerful selective force in the evolution of the neural circuits involved. Birds and other non-mammals have internally coupled middle ears working as pressure-difference receivers that may significantly enhance ITD, depending on the precise properties of the interaural connection. Here, the extent of this internal coupling was investigated in chickens, specifically under the same experimental conditions as typically used in neurophysiology of ITD-coding circuits, i.e. with headphone stimulation. Cochlear microphonics (CM) were recorded simultaneously from both ears of anesthetized chickens under monaural and binaural stimulation, using pure tones from 0.1 to 3 kHz. Interaural transmission peaked at 1.5 kHz at a loss of only -5.5 dB; the mean interaural delay was 264 s. CM amplitude strongly modulated as a function of ITD, confirming significant interaural coupling. The \\\"ITD heard\\\" derived from the CM phases in both ears showed enhancement, compared to the acoustic stimuli, by a factor of up to 1.8. However, the closed sound delivery systems impaired interaural transmission at low frequencies (< 1 kHz). We identify factors that need to be considered when interpreting neurophysiological data obtained under these conditions, and relating them to the natural free-field condition.\\n\\nSummary statementThe interaural time differences that chickens can use for sound localization are significantly greater than their small head size suggests. Closed-system sound stimulation can, however, produce complex artefacts.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic plasticity of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) is recently highlighted in the cerebellar local circuits, however, its physiological impact on the cerebellar learning and memory remains elusive. Using a mouse model of memory consolidation deficiency, we found that the intrinsic plasticity of PCs may be involved in motor memory consolidation. Gain-up training of the vestibulo-ocular reflex produced a decrease in the synaptic weight of PCs in both the wild-type and knockout groups. However, intrinsic plasticity was impaired only in the knockout mice. Furthermore, the observed defects in the intrinsic plasticity of PCs led to the formation of improper neural plasticity in the vestibular nucleus (VN) neurons. Our results suggest that the synergistic modulation of intrinsic and synaptic plasticity in PCs is required for the changes in following plasticity in the VN, thereby contributes to the long-term storage of motor memory.",

    "abstract": "The phenotypic changes that occurred during the domestication and diversification of grapevine are well known, particularly changes in seed morphology, but the functional causes and consequences behind these variations are poorly understood. Wild and domesticate grapes differ, among others, in the form of their pips: wild grapes produce roundish pips with short stalks and cultivated varieties have more elongated pips with longer stalks. Such variations of form are of first importance for archaeobotany since the pip form is, most often, the only remaining information in archaeological settings. This study aims to enlight archaeobotanical record and grapevine pip development by better understanding how size and shape (co)variates between pip and berry in both wild and domesticated Vitis vinifera. The covariation of berry size, number of seeds per berry (\"piposity\"), pip size and pip shape were explored on 49 grapevine accessions sampled among Euro-Mediterranean traditional cultivars and wild grapevines. We show that for wild grapevine, the higher the piposity, the bigger the berry and the more elongated the pip. For both wild and domesticated grapevine, the longer is the pip, the more it has a \"domesticated\" shape. Consequences for archaeobotanical studies are tested and discussed, and these covariations allowed the inference of berry dimensions from archaeological pips from a Southern France Roman site. This systematic exploration sheds light on new aspects of pip-berry relationship, in both size and shape, on grapevine eco-evo-devo changes during domestication, and invites to explore further the functional ecology of grapevine pip and berry and notably the impact of cultivation practices and human selection on grapevine morphology.",

Because of the critical role of A3B in promoting virus and tumor evolution, small molecule inhibitors are desirable. However, there is no reported structure for any of the APOBEC3-family enzymes in complex with a small molecule bound in the active site, which hampers the development of small molecules targeting A3B. Here we report high-resolution structures of an active A3B catalytic domain chimera with loop 7 residues exchanged with those from the corresponding region of APOBEC3G (A3G). The structures reveal novel open conformations lacking the catalytically essential zinc ion, with the highly conserved active site residues extensively rearranged. These inactive conformations are stabilized by 2-pyrimidone or an iodide ion bound in the active site. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the remarkable plasticity of the engineered active site and identify key interactions that stabilize the native A3B active site. These data provide insights into A3B active site dynamics and suggest possible modes of its inhibition by small molecules, which would aid in rational design of selective A3B inhibitors for constraining virus and tumor evolution.",

However, the detailed neural circuitry mediating sleep is far from understood. Here, we found that glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (Gad67)-positive GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTAGad67+) are a key regulator of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice. VTAGad67+ neurons project to multiple brain areas implicated in sleep/wakefulness regulation such as the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and dorsal raphe nucleus. Chemogenetic activation of VTAGad67+ neurons promoted NREM sleep with higher delta power whereas optogenetic inhibition of these neurons induced prompt arousal from NREM sleep under highly somnolescent conditions, but not during REM sleep. In vivo fiber photometry recordings revealed that VTAGad67+ neurons showed the highest population activity in NREM sleep and the lowest activity in REM sleep. Acute brain slice electrophysiology combined with optogenetics revealed that VTAGad67+ neurons directly innervate and inhibit wake-promoting orexin/hypocretin neurons in the LH by releasing GABA. Taken together, we reveal that VTAGad67+ neurons play a crucial role in the regulation of NREM sleep.",

However, a systematic exploration can only be performed in silico. Stimulation takes the system out of its attractor states and samples the environment of the flow to gain insight into the stability and multiplicity of trajectories. It is the only means of obtaining a complete understanding of the healthy brain networks dynamic properties. We built a whole mouse brain model with connectivity derived from tracer studies. We systematically varied the stimulation location, the ratio of long- to short-range interactions, and the range of short connections. Functional networks appeared in the spatial motifs of simulated brain activity. Several motifs included the default mode network, suggesting a junction of functional networks. The model explains processing in sensory systems and replicates the in vivo dynamics after stimulation without parameter tuning, emphasizing the role of connectivity.",

A major challenge in studying megakaryocyte development, and the diseases that arise from their dysfunction, is the identification, classification, and enrichment of megakaryocyte progenitor cells that are produced during hematopoiesis. Here, we present a high throughput strategy for identifying and isolating megakaryocytes and their progenitor cells from a heterogeneous population of bone marrow samples. Specifically, we couple thrombopoietin (TPO) induction, image flow cytometry, and principle components analysis (PCA) to identify and enrich for megakaryocyte progenitor cells that are capable of self-renewal and directly differentiating into mature megakaryocytes. This enrichment strategy distinguishes megakaryocyte progenitors from other lineage-committed cells in a high throughput manner. Furthermore, by using image flow cytometry with PCA, we have identified a combination of markers and characteristics that can be used to isolate megakaryocyte progenitor cells using standard flow cytometry methods. Altogether, these techniques enable the high throughput enrichment and isolation of cells in the megakaryocyte lineage and have the potential to enable rapid disease identification and diagnoses ahead of severe disease progression.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) is a hemorrhagic disease of domestic swine, with often high mortality rates registered. To date there is still no vaccine produced against ASF, and disease management in countries including Uganda, where the disease is endemic is dependent on accurate and timely diagnosis programs and quarantine. This study aimed at contributing more knowledge towards ASF diagnosis by investigating the serodiagnostic potential of synthetic peptides of an ASF putative protein pCP312R. Antigenic regions of the pCP312R putative protein were identified using Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity prediction method and twelve (12) peptides were predicted, out of which four (4) peptides were selected and synthesised. An additional peptide derived from the carboxyl end of the ASFV p54 protein was also synthesised and used as a control. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against each of the five peptides was used in immunohistochemistry, and each demonstrated ability to localize viral antigen in pig tissue albeit with slightly varying intensities, at a dilution of 1:200, with antibodies against peptides cpr1, cpr2, cpr3 and cpr4 all accurately staining infected macrophages. However all the peptides evaluated in this study performed moderately when used in indirect ELISA tests giving the following results; CP1; diagnostic sensitivity of 55% (95% CI, 0.3421-0.7418) and specificity of 96% (95% CI, 0.8046-0.9929), CP2; diagnostic sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 0.8389-1) and specificity of 52% (95% CI, 0.335-0.6997), CP3; diagnostic sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 76.39-99.11) and specificity of 88% (95% CI, 70.04-95.83), CP4; diagnostic sensitivity of 90% (95% CI: 0.699-0.9721) and specificity of 76% (95% CI: 0.5657-0.885) and p54; diagnostic sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 0.8389-1) and specificity of 56% (95% CI, 0.3707-0.7333).

    "abstract": "Currently, over 20 genes have been defined that can confer susceptibility for high-risk breast cancer. Although research has proved the utility of multiple-gene sequencing in the assessment of breast cancer risk, there is little data from China patients. Here, we use a multiple-gene sequencing panel to identify the variant spectrum in Chinese high-risk breast cancer subjects.\\n\\nA total of 829 Chinese high-risk breast cancer patients participated in the research. The coding regions of 115 hereditary cancer susceptibility genes were sequenced using a next generation sequencing platform. In total, 193 pathogenic variants were identified in 45 genes from 177 patients. The pathogenic variant carrier rate is 21.4%: with 10.5% patients carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation only, 10.0% of patients carried non-BRCA gene mutations only, while 1.0% of patients carried both a BRCA1/2 and a non-BRCA gene mutation. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) totaling 2632 were identified in 115 genes from 787 of 829 patients: 82.5% patients carried more than one VUS, and only 5.1% patients did not carry any VUS. Families carrying pathogenic variants were tracked and adenoma was founded in three of them. Our data provide a comprehensive analysis of potential susceptibility variations of high-risk for breast cancer in a Chinese population. This data will be useful for the comparison of the susceptibility variation spectrum between different populations and to discover potential pathogenic variants to improve the prevention and treatment of high-risk breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Patient-derived models are transforming translational cancer research. It is not clear if the emergence of patient-derived organoid (PDO) models can extend the utility of the widely used patient-derived xenograft (PDX). In addition, the utility of PDO models for serum biomarker discovery is not known. Here, we demonstrate that PDO models recapitulate the genomics, cell biology, glycomics and drug responses observed in PDX models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of PDO models for identification of N-glycans that are enriched in the glycome of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Surprisingly, among all the glycans observed in PDX and PDOs, a core set of 57 N-glycans represent 50-94% of the relative abundance of all N-glycans detected, suggesting that only a subset of glycans dominate the cell surface landscape in PDAC. In addition, we outline a tumor organoid-based pipeline to identify surface proteins in extracellular vesicles (EV) from media supernatant of PDO cultures. When combined with the affinity-based validation platform, the EV surface proteins discovered in PDOs are effective in differentiating patients with PDAC from those with benign pancreatitis in the clinic, identifying PDO as powerful discovery platform for serum biomarkers. Thus, PDOs extend the utility of the archival collections of PDX models for translational research and function as a powerful platform for identification of clinically-actionable biomarkers in patients blood.\n\nSignificance statementTumor organoids extend the utility of PDX models as platforms for investigating drug response, glycosylation changes and function as new platforms for discovering blood-based biomarkers",

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled growth in solid tumor generates compressive stress that drives cancer cells into invasive phenotypes, but little is known about how such stress affects the invasion and matrix degradation of cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. Here we show that compressive stress enhanced invasion, matrix degradation, and invadopodia formation of breast cancer cells. We further identified Piezo1 channels as the putative mechanosensitive cellular components that transmit the compression to induce calcium influx, which in turn triggers activation of RhoA, Src, FAK, and ERK signaling, as well as MMP-9 expression. Interestingly, for the first time we observed invadopodia with matrix degradation ability on the apical side of the cells, similar to those commonly observed at the cells ventral side. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Piezo1 and caveolae were both involved in mediating the compressive stress-induced cancer cell invasive phenotype as Piezo1 and caveolae were often colocalized, and reduction of Cav-1 expression or disruption of caveolae with methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin led to not only reduced Piezo1 expression but also attenuation of the invasive phenotypes promoted by compressive stress. Taken together, our data indicate that mechanical compressive stress activates Piezo1 channels to mediate enhanced cancer cell invasion and matrix degradation that may be a critical mechanotransduction pathway during, and potentially a novel therapeutic target for, breast cancer metastasis",

However, orexin neurons produce and release orexin as well as several co-transmitters including dynorphin and glutamate. Thus, it is important to disambiguate orexin peptide-dependent and -independent physiological functions of orexin neurons. To attain this, we generated a novel orexin-flippase (Flp) knock-in (KI) mouse line. Crossing with Flp-reporter or Cre-expressing mice showed gene expression exclusively in orexin neurons. Histological studies confirmed that orexin was completely knock-out (KO) in KI/KI homozygous mice. Orexin neurons without orexin showed altered electrophysiological properties, as well as received decreased glutamatergic inputs. Selective chemogenetic activation revealed that both orexin and co-transmitters functioned to increase wakefulness, however, orexin was indispensable to promote sustained arousal. Surprisingly, activation of orexin neurons without orexin caused a significant increase in the total time spent in cataplexy. Taken together, orexin is essential to maintain basic membrane properties and input-output computation of orexin neurons, as well as to exert awake-sustaining aptitude of orexin neurons.",

    "abstract": "The Red Queen Hypothesis, which suggests that continual evolution can result from solely biotic interactions, has been studied in macroevolutionary and microevolutionary contexts. While microevolutionary studies have described examples in which evolution does not cease, understanding which general conditions lead to continual evolution or to stasis remains a major challenge. In many cases, it is unclear which experimental features or model assumptions are necessary for the observed continual evolution to emerge, and whether the described behavior is robust to variations in the given setup. Here, we aim to find the minimal set of conditions under which continual evolution occurs. To this end, we present a theoretical framework that does not assume any specific functional form and, therefore, can be applied to a wide variety of systems. Our framework is also general enough to cast predictions about both monomorphic and polymorphic populations. We show that the combination of a fast positive and a slow negative feedback causes continual evolution to emerge even from the evolution of one single evolving trait, provided that the ecological timescale is sufficiently separated from the timescales of mutation and the negative feedback. Our approach and results thus contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics resulting from biotic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Sensitive and accurate biomarkers for the prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimers Disease (AD) are needed to both support clinical care and enhance clinical trial design. Here, we examined the potential of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of a peptide derived from a neural protein involved in synaptic transmission, VGF (a non-initialism), to enhance accuracy of prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. The performance of conventional biomarkers (CSF A{beta}1-42 and phosphorylated tau +/- hippocampal volume) was compared to the same biomarkers with CSF VGF peptide levels. It was observed that VGF peptides are lowered in patients with AD compared to controls and that combinations of CSF A{beta}1-42 and phosphorylated tau, hippocampal volume and VGF peptide levels outperformed conventional biomarkers alone (hazard ratio = 2.2 vs. 3.9). VGF peptide levels were correlated most strongly with total tau levels, but not hippocampal volume, suggesting that they serve as a marker for neuronal degradation, but not necessarily in the hippocampus. The latter point suggests that VGF may serve as a more general marker of neurodegeneration. Future work will be needed to determine the specificity of VGF for AD vs. other neurodegenerative diseases.",

In this study, whole organ decellularization of pancreas was attempted followed by reseeding it with adult mesenchymal stem cells. Decellularization completely removes cells leaving behind extracellular matrix rich scaffold. After reseeding, mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into pancreas specific cells. Upon transplantation of recellularized pancreas in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice, this organ was capable of restoring its histomorphology and normal functioning. Restoration of endocrine islets, the exocrine acinar region, and vascular network was seen in transplanted pancreas. The entire process of functional recovery took about 20 days when the mice demonstrated glucoregulation, though none achieved gluconormalization. Transplanted mice upon feeding show insulin and c-peptide in circulation. This process demonstrates that natural scaffolds of soft organs can be refunctionalized using recipients cells to counter immune problems arising due to organ transplantation.",

These indicator properties are generally assumed for assemblage-based indicators such as diatom transfer functions that use species abundance data to infer environmental variables. However, failure of assemblage approaches necessitates the interpretation of individual dominant taxa when making environmental inferences. To determine whether diatom species from Laurentian Great Lakes sediment cores have the potential to provide unambiguous inferences of anthropogenic stress, we evaluated fossil diatom abundance against a suite of historical environmental gradients: human population, agriculture, mining, atmospheric nutrient deposition, atmospheric temperature and ice cover. Several diatom species, such as Stephanodiscus parvus, had reliable relationships with anthropogenic stress such as human population. However, many species had little or no indicator value or had confusing relationships with multiple environmental variables, suggesting one should be careful when using those species to infer stress in the Great Lakes. Recommendations for future approaches to refining diatom indicators are discussed, including accounting for the effects of broad species geographic distributions to minimize region-specific responses that can weaken indicator power.",

    "abstract": "Fecal pollution of water bodies poses a serious threat for public health and ecosystems. Microbial source tracking (MST) using host specific bacteria are used to track the source of this potential pollution and be able to perform a better management of the pollution at the source. In this study we tested 12 molecular MST markers to track human, ruminant, sheep, horse, pig and gull pollution to determine their usefulness in their application for an effective management of water quality. First, the potential of the selected markers to track the source was evaluated using fresh fecal samples. Subsequently, we evaluated their performance in a catchment with different impacts, considering land use and environmental conditions. All MST markers showed high sensitivity and specificity, although none achieved 100% for both. Although some of the MST markers were detected in hosts other than the intended ones, their abundance in the target group was always several orders of magnitude higher than in the non-target hosts, demonstrating their suitability to distinguish between sources of pollution. The MST analysis matched the land use in the watershed allowing a very accurate assessment of the main hazards and sources of pollution, in this case mainly human and ruminant pollution. Correlating environmental parameters like temperature and rainfall with the levels of the MST markers provided insight into the dynamics of the pollution along the catchment. The levels of the human associated marker showed a significant negative correlation with rainfall in human polluted areas suggesting a dilution of the pollution, whereas at agricultural areas the ruminant marker increased with rainfall. There were no seasonal differences in the levels of human marker, indicating human pollution as a constant pressure throughout the year, whereas the levels of the ruminant marker was influenced by the seasons, being more abundant in summer and autumn. Performing MST analysis integrated with land uses and environmental data can improve the management of fecal polluted areas and set up good practices.",

    "abstract": "High-quality genotypic data is a requirement for many genetic analyses. For any crop, errors in genotype calls, phasing of markers, linkage maps, pedigree records, and unnoticed variation in ploidy levels can lead to spurious marker-locus-trait associations and incorrect origin assignment of alleles to individuals. High-throughput genotyping requires automated scoring, as manual inspection of thousands of scored loci is too time-consuming. However, automated SNP scoring can result in errors that should be corrected to ensure recorded genotypic data are accurate and thereby ensure confidence in downstream genetic analyses. To enable quick identification of errors in a large genotypic data set, we have developed a comprehensive workflow. This multiple-step workflow is based on inheritance principles and on removal of markers and individuals that do not follow these principles, as demonstrated here for apple, peach, and sweet cherry. Genotypic data was obtained on pedigreed germplasm using 6-9K SNP arrays for each crop and a subset of well-performing SNPs was created using ASSIsT. Use of correct (and corrected) pedigree records readily identified violations of simple inheritance principles in the genotypic data, streamlined with FlexQTL software. Retained SNPs were grouped into haploblocks to increase the information content of single alleles and reduce computational power needed in downstream genetic analyses. Haploblock borders were defined by recombination locations detected in ancestral generations of cultivars and selections. Another round of inheritance-checking was conducted, for haploblock alleles (i.e., haplotypes). High-quality genotypic data sets were created using this workflow for pedigreed collections representing the U.S. breeding germplasm of apple, peach, and sweet cherry evaluated within the RosBREED project. These data sets contain 3855, 4005, and 1617 SNPs spread over 932, 103, and 196 haploblocks in apple, peach, and sweet cherry, respectively. The highly curated phased SNP and haplotype data sets, as well as the raw iScan data, of germplasm in the apple, peach, and sweet cherry Crop Reference Sets is available through the Genome Database for Rosaceae.",

    "abstract": "Dental caries, the most common chronic infectious disease, involve Streptococcus mutans SpaP A/B/C and Cnm/Cbm adhesin types of different virulence. We have explored their stability and dynamics over 5 years, their geographic distribution, as well as the potentially increased cariogenicity of specific SpaP B subtypes. We performed qPCR and TaqMan typing using whole saliva and isolates from 452 Swedish adolescents followed from 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately 50% of the children were infected at baseline with a single dominant (44%) or mixed (6%) SpaP A, B, or C type, some of which were also Cnm (6%) or Cbm (1%) positive. Stability (+, +) was high for S. mutans infection (85%) and dominant SpaP A or C (80% and 67%) and Cnm or Cbm (85% and 100%) types, but low for SpaP B (51%) and mixed SpaP A/B/C types (26%). Only five children switched from one SpaP type to another, and none between Cnm and Cbm types. Mixed SpaP A/B/C types were typically lost or changed into dominant types. Moreover, children infected with Cnm (n=26) types were more frequent in the northern (Skellefte[a]) region (p = 0.0041), and those with Cbm types (n=7) in the southern (Ume[a]) region. Children infected with SpaP B-2 subtypes had a doubled caries experience (p = 0.009) and 5-year caries increment (p = 0.02) compared to those infected with SpaP A. In conclusion, the stable dominant but instable mixed adhesin types and geographic differentiation of Cnm and Cbm types suggest adaptation of low and high cariogenicity types to specific individuals.",

    "abstract": "We use stochastic neural field theory to analyze the stimulus-dependent tuning of neural variability in ring attractor networks. We apply perturbation methods to show how the neural field equations can be reduced to a pair of stochastic nonlinear phase equations describing the stochastic wandering of spontaneously formed tuning curves or bump solutions. These equations are analyzed using a modified version of the bivariate von Mises distribution, which is well-known in the theory of circular statistics. We first consider a single ring network and derive a simple mathematical expression that accounts for the experimentally observed bimodal (or M-shaped) tuning of neural variability. We then explore the effects of inter-network coupling on stimulus-dependent variability in a pair of ring networks. These could represent populations of cells in two different layers of a cortical hypercolumn linked via vertical synaptic connections, or two different cortical hypercolumns linked by horizontal patchy connections within the same layer. We find that neural variability can be suppressed or facilitated, depending on whether the inter-network coupling is excitatory or inhibitory, and on the relative strengths and biases of the external stimuli to the two networks. These results are consistent with the general observation that increasing the mean firing rate via external stimuli or modulating drives tends to reduce neural variability.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA topic of considerable current interest concerns the neural mechanisms underlying the suppression of cortical variability following the onset of a stimulus. Since trial-by-trial variability and noise correlations are known to affect the information capacity of neurons, such suppression could improve the accuracy of population codes. One of the main candidate mechanisms is the suppression of noise-induced transitions between multiple attractors, as exemplified by ring attractor networks. The latter have been used to model experimentally measured stochastic tuning curves of directionally selective middle temporal (MT) neurons. In this paper we show how the stimulus-dependent tuning of neural variability in ring attractor networks can be analyzed in terms of the stochastic wandering of spontaneously formed tuning curves or bumps in a continuum neural field model. The advantage of neural fields is that one can derive explicit mathematical expressions for the second-order statistics of neural activity, and explore how this depends on important model parameters, such as the level of noise, the strength of recurrent connections, and the input contrast.",

Integrin {beta}4 (ITGB4) is a structural adhesion molecule that is downregulated in the airway epithelium of asthma patients. Specific ITGB4 deficiency in AECs induces exaggerated Th2 responses, severe allergen-induced airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in mouse model of allergic asthma. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. In this study, we determine the role of ITGB4 of AECs in the regulation of Th2 response and in the induction of asthma and identify the underpinning molecular mechanisms. We found that ITGB4 deficiency led to exaggerated Th2 cells infiltration, inflammation and AHR and higher production of CCL17 in HDM treated mice. ITGB4-regulated CCL17 production in AECs was regulated by EGFR, ERK and NF-{kappa}B pathways. EFGR-antagonist treatment or the neutralization of CCL17 by antibody inhibited exaggerated pathological marks in HDM-challenged ITGB4-deficient mice. Together, these results demonstrated that ITGB4 of AECs negatively regulates the development of Th2 responses of allergic asthma by down-regulation of EGFR and CCL17 pathway.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpecies-specific differences in tolerance to infection are exemplified by the high susceptibility of humans to enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) infection whereas mice are relatively resistant to this pathogen. This intrinsic species-specific difference in EHEC infection limits the translation of murine research to human. Furthermore, studying the mechanisms underlying this differential susceptibility is a difficult problem due to complex in vivo interactions between the host, pathogen, and disparate commensal microbial communities.\\n\\nResultsWe utilize organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture technology to model damage of the human colonic epithelium induced by EHEC infection, and show that epithelial injury is greater when exposed to metabolites derived from the human gut microbiome compared to mouse. Using a multi-omics approach, we discovered four human microbiome metabolites -- 4-methyl benzoic acid, 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid, hexanoic acid, and heptanoic acid -- that are sufficient to mediate this effect. The active human microbiome metabolites preferentially induce expression of flagellin, a bacterial protein associated with motility of EHEC and increased epithelial injury. Thus, the decreased tolerance to infection observed in humans versus other species may be due in part to the presence of compounds produced by the human intestinal microbiome that actively promote bacterial pathogenicity.\\n\\nConclusionOrgan on chip technology allowed the identification of specific human microbiome metabolites modulating EHEC pathogenesis. These identified metabolites are sufficient to increase susceptibility to EHEC in our human Colon Chip model and they contribute to species-specific tolerance. This work suggests that higher concentrations of these metabolites could be the reason for higher susceptibility to EHEC infection in certain human populations, such as children. Furthermore, this research lays the foundation for therapeutic-modulation of microbe products in order to prevent and treat human bacterial infection.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with unknown cause, but it has been postulated that chronic neuroinflammation may play a role in its pathogenesis. Microglia-derived lysosomal cathepsins have been increasingly recognized as important inflammatory mediators. Here, we analyzed the regional distribution and cellular localization of the cathepsin X in the rat brain with neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration. Unilateral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the striatum induced strong upregulation of cathepsin X expression and its activity in the ipsilateral striatum. In addition to the striatum, cathepsin X overexpression was detected in other areas such as cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, subventricular zone and external globus pallidus mainly restricted to glial cells. Moreover, continuous administration of the cathepsin X specific inhibitor AMS36 showed protective effects against LPS-induced striatal degeneration, as seen by the decreased extent of striatal lesion and decreased expression of neuroinflammation marker. These results demonstrate that glial upregulated cathepsin X may play a role as a potential pathogenic factor in PD. Inhibition of cathepsin X enzymatic activity thus may be useful in preventing neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "We have measured the orientation of the myosin light chain domain (lever arm) elements in demembranated muscle fibers by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), using a bifunctional spin label (BSL), with angular resolution of 4 degrees. Despite advances in X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and fluorescence polarization, none of these techniques provide high-resolution structural information about the myosin light chain domain under ambient conditions in a muscle fiber. Two cysteines, 4 residues apart, were engineered on two -helices in the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), permitting stereoselective site-directed labeling with BSL. One labeled helix (helix E) is adjacent to the myosin lever arm, the other helix (helix B) is located farther apart from the motor domain beyond the \"hinge\" of the myosin. By exchanging BSL-labeled RLC onto oriented muscle fibers, we obtained EPR spectra that determined angular distributions of BSL with high resolution, which enabled the accurate determination of helix orientation of individual structural elements with respect to the muscle fiber axis. In the absence of ATP (rigor), each of the two labeled helices exhibited both ordered ({sigma} ~ 9-11 degrees) and disordered ({sigma} > 38 degrees) populations. We used these angles to determine the orientation of the myosin lever arm, concluding that the oriented population has lever arms that are perpendicular to the muscle fiber axis. This orientation is ~33 degrees different than predicted from a standard \"lever arm down\" model based on cryo-EM of actin decorated with isolated myosin heads, but it is compatible with fluorescence polarization and EM data obtained from muscle fibers. The addition of ATP, in the absence of Ca2+, shifted the orientation to a much more disordered distribution.\n\nSummaryWe used electron paramagnetic resonance to determine the orientation of elements within the myosin regulatory light chain in skinned skeletal muscle fibers. A bifunctional spin label provided sufficient resolution to detect an ordered population of lever arms perpendicular to actin.",

    "abstract": "Nopp140, often called the nucleolar and Cajal body phosphoprotein (NOLC1), is a predicted chaperone for the transcription and processing of rRNA as it assembles into small and large ribosomal subunits. Nopp140 is conserved among the metazoans with an amino terminal LisH dimerization domain followed by a large central domain consisting of alternating acidic and basic motifs of low sequence complexity, and then a carboxyl terminus that can be variable due to alternative splicing. Treacle is another nucleolar chaperon in vertebrates that is structurally and functionally related to Nopp140. While the large central domains of vertebrate Nopp140 and treacle are encoded by several exons, the similar domain in Drosophila Nopp140 is encoded by a single exon. We define three overlapping repeat sequence patterns (P, P, and P) within the central domain of D. melanogaster Nopp140. These repeat patterns are poorly conserved in other Drosophila species. A length polymorphism for the P pattern in D. melanogaster displays either two or three 96 base pair repeats, respectively referred to as Nopp140-Short and Nopp140-Long. PCR characterization of the long and short alleles shows a poorly-defined, artefactual bias toward amplifying the long allele over the short allele. Fly lines homozygous for one or the other allele, or heterozygous for both alleles, show no discernible phenotypes. The significance of this polymorphism lies in discerning the properties of the Nopp140s large central domain in assemblage and phase separations in nucleoli and Cajal bodies.",

    "abstract": "The growth rate of single bacterial cells is continuously disturbed by random fluctuations in biosynthesis rates and by deterministic cell-cycle events, such as division, genome duplication, and septum formation. It is not understood whether, and how, bacteria reject these disturbances. Here we quantified growth and constitutive protein expression dynamics of single Bacillus subtilis cells, as a function of cell-cycle-progression. Variation in birth size and growth rate, resulting from unequal cell division, is largely compensated for when cells divide again. We analysed the cell-cycle-dynamics of these compensations and found that both growth and protein expression exhibited biphasic behaviour. During a first phase of variable duration, the absolute rates were approximately constant and cells behaved as sizers. In the second phase, rates increased and growth behaviour exhibited characteristics of a timer-strategy. This work shows how cell-cycle-dependent rate adjustments of biosynthesis and growth are integrated to compensate for physio-logical disturbances caused by cell division.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEUnder constant conditions, bacterial populations can maintain a fixed average cell size and constant exponential growth rate. At the single cell-level, however, cell-division can cause significant physiological perturbations, requiring compensatory mechanisms to restore the growth-related characteristics of individual cells toward that of the average cell. Currently, there is still a major gap in our understanding of the dynamics of these mechanisms, i.e. how adjustments in growth, metabolism and biosynthesis are integrated during the bacterial cell-cycle to compensate the disturbances caused by cell division. Here we quantify growth and constitutive protein expression in individual bacterial cells at sub-cell-cycle resolution. Significantly, both growth and protein production rates display structured and coordinated cell-cycle-dependent dynamics. These patterns reveal the dynamics of growth rate and size compensations during cell-cycle progression. Our findings provide a dynamic cell-cycle perspective that offers novel avenues for the interpretation of physiological processes that underlie cellular homeostasis in bacteria.",

The intervention engaged community members including TB survivors to recruit people with TB symptoms in a  snowball approach for screening and linkage to treatment. This study aims to explore the acceptability of active case finding with the seed-and-recruit model in detecting new TB cases and determine the characteristics of successful seeds.\\n\\nMethodsThis qualitative study was conducted in four provinces (Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Chhnang, Siem Reap, and Takeo) in Cambodia in 2017. Fifty six in-depth interviews and ten focus group discussions were conducted to gain insights into the acceptability, strengths, and challenges in implementing the model. Transcripts were coded and content analyses were performed.\\n\\nResultsThe seed-and-recruit active case finding model was generally well-received by the study participants. They saw the benefits of engaging TB survivors and utilize their social network to find new TB cases in the community. The social embeddedness of the model within the local community was one of the major strengths. The success of the model also hinges on the integration with existing health facilities. Having extensive social network, being motivated, and having good knowledge about TB were important characteristics of successful seeds. Study participants reported challenges in motivating the recruits for screening, logistic capacities, and high workload during implementation. However, there was a general consensus that the model ought to be expanded.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings indicate that the seed-and-recruit model should be fine-tuned and scaled up as part of the national TB Program to increase TB new case detection in Cambodia. Further studies are needed to more comprehensively evaluate the impacts and cost-effectiveness of the model in Cambodia as well as in other resource-limited settings.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic microbes help a myriad of insects acquire nutrients. Recent work suggests that insects also frequently associate with actinobacterial symbionts that produce molecules to help defend against parasites and predators. Here we explore a potential association between Actinobacteria and two species of fungus-farming ambrosia beetles, Xyleborinus saxesenii and Xyleborus affinis. We isolated and identified actinobacterial and fungal symbionts from laboratory reared nests, and characterized small molecules produced by the putative actinobacterial symbionts. One 16S rRNA phylotype of Streptomyces (XylebKG-1) was abundantly and consistently isolated from the nests and adults of X. saxesenii and X. affinis nests. In addition to Raffaelea sulphurea, the symbiont that X. saxesenii cultivates, we also repeatedly isolated a strain of Nectria sp. that is an antagonist of this mutualism. Inhibition bioassays between S. griseus XylebKG-1 and the fungal symbionts from X. saxesenii revealed strong inhibitory activity of the actinobacterium towards the fungal antagonist Nectria sp. but not the fungal mutualist R. sulphurea. Bioassay guided HPLC fractionation of S. griseus XylebKG-1 culture extracts, followed by NMR and mass spectrometry identified cycloheximide as the compound responsible for the observed growth inhibition. A biosynthetic gene cluster putatively encoding cycloheximide was also identified in S. griseus XylebKG-1. The consistent isolation of a single 16S phylotype of Streptomyces from two species of ambrosia beetles, and our finding that a representative isolate of this phylotype produces cycloheximide, which inhibits a parasite of the system but not the cultivated fungus, suggests that these actinobacteria may play defensive roles within these systems.",

    "abstract": "Feathers perceived by humans to be vividly colorful are often presumed to be equally conspicuous to other mammals, and thus to present an enhanced predation risk. However, many mammals that prey on adult birds have dichromatic visual systems with only two types of color-sensitive visual receptors (one sensitive to ultraviolet light), rather than the three characteristic of humans and four of most birds. Thus, understanding how these predators perceive color requires quantitative visual modeling. Here, we use a combination of reflectance spectroscopy, multispectral imaging, color vision modelling and visual texture analysis to compare the visual signals available to conspecifics and to mammalian predators for multicolored feathers from the Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) as well as red and yellow parrot feathers; we also take into account the effects of distance-dependent blurring due to visual acuity. When viewed by tetrachromatic birds against a background of green vegetation, most of the feathers studied had color and brightness contrasts similar to values previously found for ripe fruit. By contrast, when viewed by dichromat mammalian predators, the color and brightness contrasts of these feathers were only weakly detectable and often did not reach detection thresholds for typical viewing distances. We furthermore show that the peacocks erect train has undetectable color and brightness contrasts and visual textures when photographed against various foliage backgrounds. Given the similarity of photoreceptor sensitivities and feather reflectance properties across relevant species, these findings are consistent with many feathers of similar hue being inconspicuous, and in some cases potentially cryptic, in the eyes of their mammalian predators. These results suggest that many types of colorful feathers are likely to be cryptic to mammals while providing a communication channel perceptible to birds, while emphasizing the importance of understanding diverse sensory receivers in the evolution of animal coloration.",

    "abstract": "Transposons are genome components that account for the majority of genome size in many organisms, behaving as parasitic entities and interfering with the translation mechanism. Chromatin structure influences the activity of transposons, by coordinating genome accessibility for the expression and insertion of these sequences. As a case study, we show evidences of an evolutionary response of the chromatin structure to a variation in the activity of Long Interspersed Elements (LINEs) during mammals evolution, with focus on the murine radiation and primate evolution. LINEs activity was measured using a biophysical approach for modeling LINEs as an ecosystem, where different strains of transposons might reproduce, die and compete for access to the translational machinery of the host. The model, based on the discrete stochastic processes of amplification and deactivation of LINEs copies, has been adapted to the data using Bayesian statistics to estimate its main parameters: rate of growth of transposons copy number and rate of past competition between transposons variants. This approach allows to estimate the activity of ancient LINE strains still present in the genome as deactivated components, and the possible competition among different strains. We leverage these results to highlight how the change in the chromatin structure of the murine species seems to be following an increase of LINEs activity during the appearance of the murine specific strain Lx. On the contrary, a similar response is absent in primates evolution, which follows a decrease of LINEs activity during the amplication of primate specific LIMA/LPB strains.",

    "abstract": "In the post-genomics era, an emphasis has been placed on disentangling  genotype-phenotype connections so that the biological basis of complex phenotypes can be understood. However, our ability to efficiently and comprehensively characterize phenotypes lags behind our ability to characterize genomes. Here, we report a toolbox for fast and reproducible high-throughput dense phenotyping of 3D images. Given a target image, a rigid registration is first used to orient a template to the target surface, then the template is transformed further to fit the specific shape of the target using a non-rigid transformation model. As validation, we used N = 41 3D facial images registered with MeshMonk and manually landmarked at 19 locations. We demonstrate that the MeshMonk registration is accurate, with 0.62 mm as the average root mean squared error between the manual and automatic placements and no variation in landmark position or centroid size significantly attributable to landmarking method used. Though validated using 19 landmarks for comparison with traditional methods, MeshMonk allows for automatic dense phenotyping, thus facilitating more comprehensive investigations of 3D shape variation. This expansion opens up an exciting avenue of study in assessing genomic and phenomic data to better understand the genetic contributions to complex morphological traits.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, a widely used beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic, is rising globally, yet susceptibility testing remains challenging. To test whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could provide a more reliable assessment of susceptibility than traditional methods, we predicted resistance from WGS for 976 E. coli bloodstream infection isolates from Oxfordshire, UK, comparing against phenotypes from the BD Phoenix (calibrated against EUCAST guidelines). 339/976 (35%) isolates were amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant. Predictions based solely on beta-lactamase presence/absence performed poorly (sensitivity 23% (78/339)) but improved when genetic features associated with penicillinase hyper-production (e.g. promoter mutations, copy number estimates) were considered (sensitivity 82% (277/339); p<0.0001). Most discrepancies occurred in isolates with peri-breakpoint MICs. We investigated two potential causes; the phenotypic reference and the binary resistant/susceptible classification. We performed reference standard, replicated phenotyping in a random stratified subsample of 261/976 (27%) isolates using agar dilution, following both EUCAST and CLSI guidelines, which use different clavulanate concentrations. As well as disagreeing with each other, neither agar dilution phenotype aligned perfectly with genetic features. A random-effects model investigating associations between genetic features and MICs showed that some genetic features had small, variable and additive effects, resulting in variable resistance classification. Using model fixed-effects to predict MICs for the non-agar dilution isolates, predicted MICs were in essential agreement ({+/-}1 doubling dilution) with observed (BD Phoenix) MICs for 691/715 (97%) isolates. This suggests amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance in E. coli is quantitative, rather than qualitative, explaining the poorly reproducible binary (resistant/susceptible) phenotypes and suboptimal concordance between different phenotypic methods and with WGS-based predictions.",

    "abstract": "In the Baltic Sea, climate change has caused shifts in the phytoplankton spring bloom communities with co-occurrence of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Such changes likely affect the composition and function of associated bacterioplankton, key members of the carbon cycling, although the actual effects are unknown. To understand how changes in phytoplankton impact on bacterioplankton composition and function, we analysed bacterioplankton communities and their production during different phases of the spring bloom in four consecutive years across the Baltic Sea, and related them to environmental variables. Phytoplankton communities varied largely in composition, modifying the taxonomic structure and richness of the associated bacterioplankton assemblages. In presence of certain diatoms (Achnanthes taeniata, Skeletonema costatum and Chaetoceros spp.), bacterial production and diversity were high and with more relative abundance of Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. This bacterial community structure correlated positively with high diatom biomass and with high bacterial production rates. In contrast, during dinoflagellate-dominated blooms or when the diatom Thalassiosira baltica was abundant, both bacterial production rates and diversity were low, with bacterial communities dominated by SAR11 and Rhodobacteraceae. Our results demonstrate that, changes in the phytoplankton spring bloom will have profound consequences on bacterial community structure and their role in carbon cycling.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) plays essential roles in cell cycle regulation. However, due to the early embryonic lethality of mouse Cdk1 mutants, the in vivo role of CDK1 in regulating cell cycle and embryonic development remains unclear. Here, by generating zebrafish cdk1 mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 system, we show that cdk1-/- embryos exhibit severe microphthalmia accompanied with multiple defects in polarized cell division, S phase entry and M phase progression, cell apoptosis and cell differentiation, but not in interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM). By informatics analysis, we identified Top2a as a potential downstream target, and Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1 as partners of Cdk1 in cell cycle. Depletion of either Cyclin A2 or Top2a leads to decreased S phase entry and increased DNA damage response in zebrafish retinal cells, and depletion of Cyclin B1 leads to M phase arrest. Immunoprecipitation shows that Cdk1 and Cyclin A2 physically interact in vivo. Moreover, phosphorylation of Top2a on Serine 1213 (S1213) site is almost absent in either cdk1 or ccna2 mutants, but in not ccnb1 mutants. Furthermore, overexpression of TOP2AS1213, the phosphomimetic form of human TOP2A, rescues S phase entry and microphthalmia defects in cdk1-/- and ccna2-/- embryos. Taken together, our data suggests that Cdk1 interacts with Cyclin A2 to regulate S phase entry through phosphorylating Top2a, and with Cyclin B1 to regulate M phase progression in vivo.",

Moreover, over half of pregnant women who are consuming cannabis are also consuming alcohol; however, the consequences of combined prenatal alcohol and cannabis exposure on fetal development are not well understood. The current study examined behavioral development following exposure to ethanol (EtOH) and/or CP-55,940 (CP), a cannabinoid receptor agonist. From postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester, Sprague-Dawley rats received EtOH (5.25g/kg/day) or sham intubation, as well as CP (0.4 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. All subjects were tested on open field activity (PD 18-21), spatial learning (PD 40-46), and elevated plus maze (PD 30) tasks. Both EtOH and CP increased locomotor activity in the open field, and the combination produced more severe overactivity than either exposure alone. Similarly, increases in thigmotaxis in the Morris water maze were caused by either EtOH or CP alone, and were more severe with combined exposure, although only EtOH impaired spatial learning. Finally, developmental CP, but not EtOH, increased time spent in the open arms on the elevated plus maze. Overall, these data indicate that EtOH and CP produce some independent domain-specific effects, but many effects of EtOH and CP on behavior were additive. Importantly, these data suggest that combined prenatal exposure to alcohol and cannabis may be more damaging to the developing fetus, which has implications for the lives of affected individuals and families and also for establishing public health policy.",

Using ~6000 adult specimens from 14 phylogenetically well separated and ecomorphologically distinctive lineages, 11 orders, and all superorders of the placentals, I tested each group for positive craniofacial allometry (CREA). The evidence supporting CREA is overwhelming, with virtually all analyses showing proportionally longer faces in bigger species. This corroborates previous studies in other groups, consolidates CREA as a pervasive morphological trend in placental evolution and opens important research avenues for connecting micro- and macro-evolution. If found in even more lineages of non-placental mammals, confirmed in birds, and possibly discovered in other tetrapods, CREA could become one of the most general rules of morphological evolution in land vertebrates.",

To establish an infection in the tsetse midgut, Trypanosoma brucei must colonise the ectoperitrophic space (ES), located between the PM and gut epithelium. Although unproven, it is generally accepted that trypanosomes reach the ES by directly penetrating the PM in the anterior midgut. Here we revisited this event by employing novel fluorescence and electron microscopy methodologies and found that instead, trypanosomes reach the ES via the newly secreted PM in the tsetse proventriculus. Within this model, parasites colonising the proventriculus can either migrate to the ES or become trapped within PM layers forming cysts that move along the entire gut as the PM gets remodelled. Early proventricular colonisation appears to be promoted by unidentified factors in trypanosome-infected blood, resulting in higher salivary gland infections and potentially increasing parasite transmission.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSEWe previously found a dominant mutation, Rwhs, causing white spots on the retina accompanied by retinal folds. Here we identify the mutant gene to be Tmem98. In humans, mutations in the orthologous gene cause nanophthalmos. We modelled these mutations in mice and characterised the mutant eye phenotypes of these and Rwhs.\\n\\nMETHODSThe Rwhs mutation was identified to be a missense mutation in Tmem98 by genetic mapping and sequencing. The human TMEM98 nanophthalmos missense mutations were made in the mouse gene by CRISPR-Cas9. Eyes were examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy and the retinas imaged using a retinal camera. Electroretinography was used to study retinal function. Histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy techniques were used to study adult eyes.\\n\\nRESULTSAn I135T mutation of Tmem98 causes the dominant Rwhs phenotype and is perinatally lethal when homozygous. Two dominant missense mutations of TMEM98, A193P and H196P are associated with human nanophthalmos. In the mouse these mutations cause recessive retinal defects similar to the Rwhs phenotype, either alone or in combination with each other, but do not cause nanophthalmos. The retinal folds did not affect retinal function as assessed by electroretinography. Within the folds there was accumulation of disorganised outer segment material as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, and macrophages had infiltrated into these regions.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSMutations in the mouse orthologue of the human nanophthalmos gene TMEM98 do not result in small eyes. Rather, there is localised disruption of the laminar structure of the photoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the widespread and well documented control of protein synthesis by translation initiation, recent evidence suggests that translation elongation can also control protein synthesis rates. One of the proposed mechanisms leading to elongation control is the interference of slow ribosome movement around the start codon with efficient translation initiation. Here we estimate the frequency with which this mode of control occurs in bakers yeast growing in rich medium. Genome-wide data reveal that transcripts from around 20% of yeast genes show evidence of queueing ribosomes, which may be indicative of translation elongation control. Moreover, this subset of transcripts is sensitive to distinct regulatory signals compared to initiation-controlled mRNAs, and such distinct regulation occurs for example during the response to osmotic stress.\n\nNotethe previous version 2 of this preprint contained a Decision-Tree based analysis where we attempted to relate mRNA features to the presence or absence of queueing ribosome peaks. Since releasing that version, we performed additional controls for this analysis which strongly sugest that its results are random and should be ignored. Specifically, both the overall predictability and the importance of individual features is very similar for a real dataset where genes are labelled as containing a second SSU peak or not, and for a simulated control dataset containing an equal proportion of randomly labelled genes. We have removed this figure from the current version. The analysis together with the additional control remains accessible on the accompanying Github repository (github.com/tobiasvonderhaar/ribosomespeedcontrol) in the file \"Figure 3 Obsolete (Classification).ipynb\".",

    "abstract": "1The yeast centrosome or Spindle Pole Body (SPB) is situated in the nuclear membrane, where it nucleates spindle microtubules and acts as a signalling hub. Previously, we used Synthetic Physical Interactions to map the regions of the cell that are sensitive to forced relocalization of proteins across the proteome [Berry et al., 2016]. Here, we expand on this work to show that the SPB, in particular, is sensitive to the relocalization of many proteins. This work inspired a new data analysis approach that indicates that relocalization screens may produce more growth defects than previously reported. A set of associations with the SPB result in elevated SPB number and since hyper-proliferation of centrosomes is a hallmark of cancer cells, these associations point the way for the use of yeast models in the study of spindle formation and chromosome segregation in cancer.",

Intraspecific competition can induce plastic changes of growth rate and asymptotic length and competition may itself be modulated by temperature.\\nC_LIO_LIOur aim is to disentangle the joint effects of temperature and intraspecific competition on growth rate and asymptotic length.\\nC_LIO_LIWe used two distinct clonal lineages of the Collembola Folsomia candida, to describe thermal reaction norms of growth rate, asymptotic length and reproduction over 6 temperatures between 6{degrees}C and 29{degrees}C. In parallel, we measured the long-term size-structure and dynamics of populations reared under the same temperatures to measure growth rates and asymptotic lengths in populations and to quantify the joint effects of competition and temperature on these traits.\\nC_LIO_LIWe show that intraspecific competition modulates the temperature-size rule. In dense populations there is a direct negative effect of temperature on asymptotic length, but there is no temperature dependence of the growth rate, the dominant factor regulating growth being competition. We fail to demonstrate that the strength of competition varies with temperature except at the lowest temperature where competition is minimal. The two lineages responded differently to the joint effects of temperature and competition and these genetic differences have marked effects on population dynamics along our temperature gradient.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results reinforce the idea that the TSR response of ectotherms can be modulated by biotic and abiotic stressors when studied in non-optimal laboratory experiments. Untangling complex interactions between environment and demography will help understanding how size will respond to environmental change and how climate change may influence population dynamics.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton-virus interactions are major determinants of geochemical cycles in the oceans. Viruses are responsible for the redirection of carbon and nutrients away from larger organisms back towards microorganisms via the lysis of microalgae in a process coined the  viral shunt. Virus-host interactions are generally expected to follow  boom and bust dynamics, whereby a numerically dominant strain is lysed and replaced by a virus resistant strain. Here, we isolated a microalga and its infective nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) concomitantly from the environment in the surface NW Mediterranean Sea, Ostreococcus mediterraneus, and show continuous growth in culture of both the microalga and the virus. Evolution experiments through single cell bottlenecks demonstrate that, in the absence of the virus, susceptible cells evolve from one ancestral resistant single cell, and vice-versa; that is that resistant cells evolve from one ancestral susceptible cell. This provides evidence that the observed sustained viral production is the consequence of a minority of virus-susceptible cells. The emergence of these cells is explained by low-level phase switching between virus-resistant and virus-susceptible phenotypes, akin to a bet hedging strategy. Whole genome sequencing and analysis of the ~14 Mb microalga and the ~200 kb virus points towards ancient speciation of the microalga within the Ostreococcus species complex and frequent gene exchanges between prasinoviruses infecting Ostreococcus species. Re-sequencing of one susceptible strain demonstrated that the phase switch involved a large 60 Kb deletion of one chromosome. This chromosome is an outlier chromosome compared to the streamlined, gene dense, GC-rich standard chromosomes, as it contains many repeats and few orthologous genes. While this chromosome has been described in three different genera, its size increments have been previously associated to antiviral immunity and resistance in another species from the same genus. Mathematical modelling of this mechanism predicts microalga-virus population dynamics consistent with the observation of continuous growth of both virus and microalga. Altogether, our results suggest a previously overlooked strategy in phytoplankton-virus interactions.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies of change blindness have suggested a distinction between detection and localisation of changes in a visual scene. Using a simple paradigm with an array of coloured squares, the present study aimed to further investigate differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) between trials in which participants could detect the presence of a colour change but not identify the location of the change (sense trials), versus those where participants could both detect and localise the change (localise trials). Individual differences in performance were controlled for by adjusting the difficulty of the task in real time. Behaviourally, reaction times for sense, blind, and false alarm trials were distinguishable when comparing across levels of participant certainty. In the EEG data, we found no significant differences in the visual awareness negativity ERP, contrary to previous findings. In the N2pc range, both awareness conditions (localise and sense) were significantly different to trials with no change detection (blind trials), suggesting that this ERP is not dependent on explicit awareness. Within the late parietal positivity range, all conditions were significantly different. These results suggest that changes can be  sensed without knowledge of the location of the changing object, and that participant certainty scores can provide valuable information about the perception of changes in change blindness.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug among pregnant women, and rates are likely to increase given recent legalization. In addition, half of pregnant women who report consuming cannabis also report drinking alcohol. However, little is known about the consequences of prenatal cannabis alone or combination with alcohol, particularly with cannabis products that are continually increasing in potency of the primary psychoactive constituent in cannabis, {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The current study investigated the effects of early exposure to cannabinoids during the brain growth spurt on early physical and motor development alone (Experiment 1) or in combination with alcohol (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to a cannabinoid receptor agonist (CP-55,940 [CP]; 0.1, 0.25, 0.4 mg/kg/day), the drug vehicle, or a saline control from postnatal days (PD) 4-9. In Experiment 2, rat pups were exposed to CP (0.4 mg/kg/day) or the vehicle, and were additionally intubated with alcohol (11.9% v/v; 5.25 g/kg/day) or received a sham intubation. Subjects in both experiments were tested on a motor development task (PD 12-20) and a motor coordination task during adolescence (PD 30-32). Both developmental cannabinoid and alcohol exposure separately decreased body growth throughout development, and combined exposure exacerbated these effects, although only alcohol exposure induced long-term body weight reductions. Developmental cannabinoid exposure advanced early motor development, whereas alcohol exposure delayed development, and subjects given combined exposure did not differ from controls on some measures. Alcohol exposure impaired motor coordination later in life. In contrast, cannabinoid exposure, by itself did not significantly affect long-term motor coordination, but did exacerbate alcohol-related impairments in motor coordination among females. These results suggest that cannabinoid exposure may not only alter development by itself, but may exacerbate alcohols teratogenic effects in specific behavioral domains. These findings have important implications not only for individuals affected by prenatal exposure, but also for establishing public policy for women regarding cannabis use during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Facing perceptual uncertainty, the brain combines information from different senses to shape optimal decision making and to guide behavior. Despite overlapping neural networks underlying multisensory integration and perceptual decision making, the process chain of decision formation has been studied mostly in unimodal contexts and is thought to be supramodal. To reveal whether and how multisensory processing interplay with perceptual decision making, we devised a paradigm mimicking naturalistic situations where human participants were exposed to continuous cacophonous audiovisual inputs containing an unpredictable relevant signal cue in one or two modalities. Using multivariate pattern analysis on concurrently recorded EEG, we decoded the neural signatures of sensory encoding and decision formation stages. Generalization analyses across conditions and time revealed that multisensory signal cues were processed faster during both processing stages. We further established that acceleration of neural dynamics was directly linked to two distinct multisensory integration processes and associated with multisensory benefit. Our results, substantiated in both detection and categorization tasks, provide evidence that the brain integrates signals from different modalities at both the sensory encoding and the decision formation stages.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveInflammatory bowel diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality. Aberrant NF-{kappa}B signalling is strongly associated with these conditions, and several established drugs influence the NF-{kappa}B signalling network to exert their effect. This study aimed to identify drugs which alter NF-{kappa}B signalling and may be repositioned for use in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nDesignThe SysmedIBD consortium established a novel drug-repurposing pipeline based on a combination of in-silico drug discovery and biological assays targeted at demonstrating an impact on NF-kappaB signalling, and a murine model of IBD.\n\nResultsThe drug discovery algorithm identified several drugs already established in IBD, including corticosteroids. The highest-ranked drug was the macrolide antibiotic Clarithromycin, which has previously been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in aseptic conditions.\n\nClarithromycins effects were validated in several experiments: it influenced NF-{kappa}B mediated transcription in murine peritoneal macrophages and intestinal enteroids; it suppressed NF-{kappa}B protein shuttling in murine reporter enteroids; it suppressed NF-{kappa}B (p65) DNA binding in the small intestine of mice exposed to LPS, and it reduced the severity of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice. Clarithromycin also suppressed NF-{kappa}B (p65) nuclear translocation in human intestinal enteroids.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that in-silico drug repositioning algorithms can viably be allied to laboratory validation assays in the context of inflammatory bowel disease; and that further clinical assessment of clarithromycin in the management of inflammatory bowel disease is required.",

    "abstract": "A critical area of inquiry in the neurobiology of alcohol abuse is the neural mechanisms by which cues gain the ability to elicit alcohol use. We previously showed that cue-evoked activity in rat ventral pallidum (VP) robustly encodes the value of cues trained under both Pavlovian and instrumental contingencies, despite a stronger relationship between cue-evoked responses and behavioral latency after instrumental training. Here, we assessed VP neural representations of cue value in rats trained with a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS+) that predicted alcohol delivery, and in rats trained with an instrumental discriminative stimulus (DS) that predicted alcohol availability if the rat entered the reward port during the cue. We also examined the impact of alcohol exposure itself on the integrity of this type of signaling in rats trained with sucrose. Decoding of cue value based on VP firing was blunted for an alcohol CS+ versus an alcohol DS, as well as in comparison to a sucrose DS or CS+. Further, homecage alcohol exposure had opposing effects on VP encoding of cue value for a sucrose DS versus a sucrose CS+, enhancing decoding accuracy for the DS and reducing decoding accuracy for the CS+. These findings suggest that problem alcohol seeking may result from biased engagement of specific reward-related processes via changes in VP signaling.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTumour cells rely on glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to survive. Thus mitochondrial OXPHOS has become an increasingly attractive area for therapeutic exploitation in cancer. However, mitochondria are required for intracellular oxygenation and normal physiological processes, and it remains unclear which mitochondrial molecular mechanisms might provide therapeutic benefit. Previously, we discovered that coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix domain-containing protein 4 (CHCHD4) is critical for maintaining intracellular oxygenation and required for the cellular response to hypoxia (low oxygenation) in tumour cells through molecular mechanisms that we do not yet fully understand. Overexpression of CHCHD4 in human cancers, correlates with increased tumour progression and poor patient survival.\\n\\nRESULTSHere, we show that elevated CHCHD4 expression provides a proliferative and metabolic advantage to tumour cells in normoxia and hypoxia. Using stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and analysis of the whole mitochondrial proteome, we show that CHCHD4 dynamically affects the expression of a broad range of mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits from complex I-V, including multiple subunits of complex I (CI) required for complex assembly that are essential for cell survival. We found that loss of CHCHD4 protects tumour cells from respiratory chain inhibition at CI, while elevated CHCHD4 expression in tumour cells leads to significantly increased sensitivity to CI inhibition, in part through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOur study highlights an important role for CHCHD4 in regulating tumour cell metabolism, and reveals that CHCHD4 confers metabolic vulnerabilities to tumour cells through its control of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and CI biology.",
