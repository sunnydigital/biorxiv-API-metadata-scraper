    "abstract": "MotivationDifferent ChIP-seq peak callers often produce different output results from the same input. Since different peak callers are known to produce differentially enriched peaks with a large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, accurately annotating peak lists with their nearest genes can be an arduous process. Functional genomic annotation of histone modification ChIP-seq data can be a particularly challenging task, as chromatin marks that have inherently broad peaks with a diffuse range of signal enrichment (e.g., H3K9me1, H3K27me3) differ significantly from narrow peaks that exhibit a compact and localized enrichment pattern (e.g., H3K4me3, H3K9ac). In addition, varying degrees of tissue-dependent broadness of an epigenetic mark can make it difficult to accurately and reliably link sequencing data to biological function. Thus, there exists an unmet need to develop a software program that can precisely tailor the computational analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset to the specific peak coordinates of the data and its surrounding genomic features.\\n\\nResultsgeneXtendeR optimizes the functional annotation of ChIP-seq peaks by exploring relative differences in annotating ChIP-seq peak sets to variable-length gene bodies. In contrast to prior techniques, geneXtendeR considers peak annotations beyond just the closest gene, allowing users to investigate peak summary statistics for the first-closest gene, second-closest gene, ..., nth-closest gene whilst ranking the output according to biologically relevant events and iteratively comparing the fidelity of peak-to-gene overlap across a user-defined range of upstream and downstream extensions on the original boundaries of each genes coordinates. We tested geneXtendeR on 547 human transcription factor ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets and 198 human histone modification ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets, providing the analysis results as case studies.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe geneXtendeR R/Bioconductor package (including detailed introductory vignettes) is available under the GPL-3 Open Source license and is freely available to download from Bioconductor at: https://bioconductor.org/packages/geneXtendeR/\\n\\nAuthor summarygeneXtendeR makes functional annotation of ChIP-seq data more robust and precise, regardless of peak variability attributable to parameter tuning or peak caller algorithmic differences. Since different ChIP-seq peak callers produce differentially enriched peaks with large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, annotating peak lists with their nearest genes can often be a noisy process where an adjacent second or third-closest gene may constitute a more viable biological candidate, e.g., during cases of linked genes that are located close to each other. As such, the goal of geneXtendeR is to robustly link differentially enriched peaks with their respective genes, thereby aiding experimental follow-up and validation in designing primers for a set of prospective gene candidates during qPCR.",

    "abstract": "Optimal mating decisions depend on stable signaling systems because any independent changes in either the signal or its perception could carry a fitness cost. However, since the perception and production of specific mating signals are often mediated by different tissues and cell types, the genetic and cellular mechanisms that drive and maintain their coupling on the evolutionary and physiological timescales remain unknown for most animal species. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster, sensory perception and synthesis of an inhibitory mating pheromone is regulated by the action of Gr8a, a member of the Gustatory receptor gene family. Particularly, Gr8a acts as a pheromone chemoreceptor in the sensory system of males and females, and, independently regulates pheromone synthesis in the male fat body and oenocytes. These data provide a relatively simple molecular explanation for how genetic coupling allows for the robust and stable flow of social information at the population level.",

In this paper, we present in vivo functional PA (fPA) imaging of chemoconvulsant rat seizure model with intact scalp using a fluorescence quenching-based cyanine voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) characterized by a lipid vesicle model mimicking different levels of membrane potential variation. The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Our normalized time-frequency analysis presented in vivo VSD response in the seizure group significantly distinguishable from those of the control groups at sub-mm spatial resolution. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that the near-infrared fPA VSD imaging is a promising tool for in vivo recording of brain activities through intact scalp, which would pave a way to its future translation.",

    "abstract": "The RNA world hypothesis relies on the ability of ribonucleic acids to spontaneously acquire complex structures capable of supporting essential biological functions. Multiple sophisticated evolutionary models have been proposed for their emergence, but they often assume specific conditions. In this work we explore a simple and parsimonious scenario describing the emergence of complex molecular structures at the early stages of life. We show that at specific GC-content regimes, an undirected replication model is sufficient to explain the apparition of multi-branched RNA secondary structures - a structural signature of many essential ribozymes. We ran a large scale computational study to map energetically stable structures on complete mutational networks of 50-nucleotide-long RNA sequences. Our results reveal that the sequence landscape with stable structures is enriched with multi-branched structures at a length scale coinciding with the appearance of complex structures in RNA databases. A random replication mechanism preserving a 50% GC-content may suffice to explain a natural enrichment of stable complex structures in populations of functional RNAs. By contrast, an evolutionary mechanism eliciting the most stable folds at each generation appears to help reaching multi-branched structures at highest GC content.",

    "abstract": "Correct wiring in the neocortex requires that responses to an individual guidance cue vary among neurons in the same location, and within the same neuron over time. Nestin is an atypical intermediate filament expressed highly in neural progenitors and is thus used widely as a progenitor marker. Here we show a subpopulation of embryonic cortical neurons which transiently express nestin in their axons. Nestin expression is thus not restricted to neural progenitors but persists at lower levels in some newborn neurons for 2-3 days. We found that nestin-expressing neurons have smaller growth cones, suggesting that nestin affects cytoskeletal dynamics. Nestin, unlike other intermediate filament subtypes, regulates cdk5 kinase. Cdk5 activity is induced by the repulsive guidance cue Sema3a leading to growth cone collapse in vitro. Therefore, we tested whether nestin-expressing neurons showed altered responses to Sema3a. We find that nestin-expressing newborn neurons are more sensitive to Sema3a in a roscovitine-sensitive manner, whereas nestin knockdown results in lowered sensitivity to Sema3a. We propose that nestin functions in immature neurons to modulate cdk5 and thereby the Sema3a response. Thus, the transient expression of nestin could allow for temporal modulation of a neuron's response to Sema3a particularly during early axon guidance decisions.",

    "abstract": "Efficient precision genome editing requires a quick, quantitative, and inexpensive assay of editing outcomes. Here we present ICE (Inference of CRISPR Edits), which enables robust analysis of CRISPR edits using Sanger data. ICE proposes potential outcomes for editing with guide RNAs (gRNAs) and then determines which are supported by the data via regression. Additionally, we develop a score called ICE-D (Discordance) that can provide information on large or unexpected edits. We empirically confirm through over 1,800 edits that the ICE algorithm is robust, reproducible, and can analyze CRISPR experiments within days after transfection. We also confirm that ICE strongly correlates with next-generation sequencing of amplicons (Amp-Seq). The ICE tool is free to use and offers several improvements over current analysis tools. For instance, ICE can analyze individual experiments as well as multiple experiments simultaneously (batch analysis). ICE can also detect a wider variety of outcomes, including multi-guide edits (multiple gRNAs per target) and edits resulting from homology-directed repair (HDR), such as knock-ins and base edits. ICE is a reliable analysis tool that can significantly expedite CRISPR editing workflows. It is available online at ice.synthego.com, and the source code is at github.com/synthego-open/ice",

Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences effect foraging performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of foraging performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of foraging performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging performance depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavior syndromes.",

To disentangle contributions from multiple factors to inter-annual variation in epidemic size, we fitted a semi-mechanistic model to time series data from 2005-2015 and performed a series of factorial simulation experiments in which seasonal epidemics were simulated under all combinations of year-specific patterns of four time-varying factors: imported cases, mosquito density, temperature, and residual variation in local conditions not explicitly represented in the model. Our results indicate that while epidemics in most years were limited by unfavorable conditions with respect to one or more factors, the epidemic in 2014 was made possible by the combination of favorable conditions for all factors considered in our analysis.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity is widely used to study the coordination of activity between brain regions over time. Functional connectivity in the default mode and task positive networks is particularly important for normal brain function. However, the processes that give rise to functional connectivity in the brain are not fully understood. It has been postulated that low-frequency neural activity plays a key role in establishing the functional architecture of the brain. Quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) are a reliably observable form of low-frequency neural activity that involve the default mode and task positive networks. Here, QPPs from resting-state and working memory task-performing individuals were acquired. The spatiotemporal pattern, strength, and frequency of the QPPs between the two groups were compared and the contribution of QPPs to functional connectivity in the brain was measured. In task-performing individuals, the spatiotemporal pattern of the QPP changes, particularly in task-relevant regions, and the QPP tends to occur with greater strength and frequency. Differences in the QPPs between the two groups could partially account for the variance in functional connectivity between resting-state and task-performing individuals. The QPPs contribute strongly to connectivity in the default mode and task positive networks and to the strength of anti-correlation seen between the two networks. Many of the connections affected by QPPs are also disrupted during several neurological disorders. These findings contribute to understanding the dynamic neural processes that give rise to functional connectivity in the brain and how they may be disrupted during disease.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIQuasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) of low-frequency activity contribute to functional connectivity\\nC_LIO_LIThe spatiotemporal pattern of QPPs differs between resting-state and task-performing individuals\\nC_LIO_LIQPPs account for significant functional connectivity in the DMN and TPN during rest and task performance\\nC_LIO_LIChanges in functional connectivity in these networks may reflect differences in QPPs\\nC_LI",

Recent findings indicate that the locus coeruleus (LC) and noradrenergic neuromodulation may also play an important role in shaping memory development in later life. However, technical challenges in quantifying LC integrity have hindered the study of LC-cognition associations in humans. Using high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging, we found that individual differences in learning and memory were positively associated with LC integrity across a variety of memory tasks in younger (n = 66), and older adults (n = 228). Moreover, we observed functionally relevant age differences confined to rostral LC. Older adults with a more youth-like rostral LC also showed higher memory performance. These findings link non-invasive, in vivo indices of LC integrity to memory in aging and highlight the role of the LC norepinephrine system in the decline of cognition.",

    "abstract": "Recreational use of concentrated oxygen has increased. Claims have been made that hyperoxic breathing can help reduce fatigue, increase alertness, and improve attentional capacities; however, few systematic studies of these potential benefits exist. Here we examined the effects of short-term (15 minute) hyperoxia on resting-states in awake human subjects by measuring spontaneous EEG activity between normoxic and hyperoxic situations, using a within-subjects design for both eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions. We also measured respiration rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels to correlate basic physiological changes due to the hyperoxic challenge with any brain activity changes. Our results show that breathing short term 100% oxygen led to increased blood-oxygen saturation levels, decreased heart rate, and a slight, but non-significant, decrease in breathing rate. Changes of brain activity were apparent, including decreases in low-alpha (7-10 Hz), high-alpha (10-14 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency ranges during eyes-opened hyperoxic conditions. During eyes-closed hyperoxia, increases in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (3.5-7 Hz) frequency range were apparent together with decreases in the beta range. Hyperoxia appeared to accentuate the decrease of low alpha and gamma ranges across the eyes-opened and closed conditions suggesting that it modulated brain state itself. As decreased alpha during eyes-opened conditions has been associated with increased attentional processing and selective attention, and increased delta and theta during eyes-closed condition are typically associated with the initiation of sleep, our results suggest a state-specific and perhaps opposing influence of short-term hyperoxia.",

    "abstract": "We have previously identified associations of two circulating secondary bile acids (glycocholenate and glycolithocolate sulfate) with atrial fibrillation (AF) risk among blacks. We aimed to replicate these findings in an independent sample including both whites and blacks, and performed a new metabolomic analysis in the combined sample. We studied 3,922 participants from the ARIC cohort followed between 1987 and 2013. Of these, 1,919 had been included in the prior analysis and 2,003 were new samples. Metabolomic profiling was done in baseline serum samples using gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. AF was ascertained from electrocardiograms, hospitalizations, and death certificates. We used multivariable Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of AF by one standard deviation difference of metabolite levels. Over a mean follow-up of 20 years, 608 participants developed AF. Glycocholenate sulfate was associated with AF in the replication and combined samples (HR 1.10, 95%CI 1.00, 1.21 and HR 1.13, 95%CI 1.04, 1.22, respectively). Glycolithocolate sulfate was not related to AF risk in the replication sample (HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.92, 1.13). An analysis of 245 metabolites in the combined cohort identified three additional metabolites associated with AF after multiple-comparison correction: pseudouridine (HR 1.18, 95%CI 1.10, 1.28), uridine (HR 0.86, 95%CI 0.79, 0.93) and acisoga (HR 1.17, 95%CI 1.09, 1.26). To conclude, we replicated a prospective association between a previously identified secondary bile acid, glycocholenate sulfate, and AF incidence, and identified new metabolites involved in nucleoside and polyamine metabolism as markers of AF risk.",

    "abstract": "Herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV)-mediated eavesdropping by plants is a well-documented, inducible phenomenon that has practical agronomic applications for enhancing plant defense and pest management. However, as with any inducible phenomenon, responding to volatile cues may incur physiological and ecological costs that limit plant productivity. In a common garden experiment, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to a single HIPV would decrease herbivore damage at the cost of reduced plant growth and reproduction. Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) and pepper (Capsicum annuum) plants were exposed to a persistent, low-dose ([~]10ng/hour) of the green leaf volatile cis-3-hexenyl acetate (z3HAC), which is an HIPV and damage-associated volatile. z3HAC-treated pepper plants were shorter, had less aboveground and belowground biomass, and produced fewer flowers and fruits relative to controls while z3HAC-treated lima bean plants were taller and produced more leaves and flowers than did controls. Natural herbivory was reduced in z3HAC-exposed lima bean plants, but not in pepper. Cyanogenic potential, a putative direct defense mechanism in lima bean, was lower in young z3HAC-exposed leaves, suggesting a growth-defense tradeoff from z3HAC exposure alone. Plant species-specific responses to an identical volatile cue have important implications for agronomic costs and benefits of volatile-mediated inter-plant communication under field conditions.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making is a complex task and requires adaptive mechanisms that facilitate efficient behaviour. Here, we consider a neural circuit that guides the behaviour of an animal in ongoing binary choice tasks. We adopt an inhibition motif from neural network theory and propose a dynamical system characterized by nonlinear feedback, which links mechanism (the implementation of the neural circuit) and function (increasing reproductive value). A central inhibitory unit influences evidence-integrating excitatory units, which in our terms correspond to motivations competing for selection. We determine the parameter regime where the animal exhibits improved decision-making behaviour, and explain different behavioural outcomes by making the link between bifurcation analysis of the nonlinear neural circuit model and decision-making performance. We find that the animal performs best if it tunes internal parameters of the neural circuit in accordance with the underlying bifurcation structure. In particular, variation of inhibition strength and excitation-over-inhibition ratio have a crucial effect on the decision outcome, by allowing the animal to break decision deadlock and to enter an oscillatory phase that describes its internal motivational state. Our findings indicate that this oscillatory phase may improve the overall performance of the animal in an ongoing foraging task. Our results underpin the importance of an integrated functional and mechanistic study of animal activity selection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOrganisms frequently select activities, which relate to economic, social and perceptual decision-making problems. The choices made may have substantial impact on their lives. In foraging decisions, for example, animals aim at reaching a target intake of nutrients; it is generally believed that a balanced diet improves reproductive success, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms that integrate nutritional needs within the brain. In our study, we address this coupling between physiological states and a decision-making circuit in the context of foraging decisions. We consider a model animal that has the drive to eat or drink. The motivation to select and perform one of these activities (i.e. eating or drinking), is processed in artificial neuronal units that have access to information on how hungry and thirsty the animal is at the point it makes the decision. We show that inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms in the neural circuit shape ongoing binary decisions, and we reveal under which conditions oscillating motivations may improve the overall performance of the animal. Our results indicate that inefficient or pathological decision-making may originate from suboptimal modulation of excitation and inhibition in the neurobiological network.",

    "abstract": "Linear mixed effect models are powerful tools used to account for population structure in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and estimate the genetic architecture of complex traits. However, fully-specified models are computationally demanding and common simplifications often lead to reduced power or biased inference. We describe Grid-LMM (https://github.com/deruncie/GridLMM), an extendable algorithm for repeatedly fitting complex linear models that account for multiple sources of heterogeneity, such as additive and non-additive genetic variance, spatial heterogeneity, and genotype-environment interactions. Grid-LMM can compute approximate (yet highly accurate) frequentist test statistics or Bayesian posterior summaries at a genome-wide scale in a fraction of the time compared to existing general-purpose methods. We apply Grid-LMM to two types of quantitative genetic analyses. The first is focused on accounting for spatial variability and non-additive genetic variance while scanning for QTL; and the second aims to identify gene expression traits affected by non-additive genetic variation. In both cases, modeling multiple sources of heterogeneity leads to new discoveries.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe goal of quantitative genetics is to characterize the relationship between genetic variation and variation in quantitative traits such as height, productivity, or disease susceptibility. A statistical method known as the linear mixed effect model has been critical to the development of quantitative genetics. First applied to animal breeding, this model now forms the basis of a wide-range of modern genomic analyses including genome-wide associations, polygenic modeling, and genomic prediction. The same model is also widely used in ecology, evolutionary genetics, social sciences, and many other fields. Mixed models are frequently multi-faceted, which is necessary for accurately modeling data that is generated from complex experimental designs. However, most genomic applications use only the simplest form of linear mixed methods because the computational demands for model fitting can be too great. We develop a flexible approach for fitting linear mixed models to genome scale data that greatly reduces their computational burden and provides flexibility for users to choose the best statistical paradigm for their data analysis. We demonstrate improved accuracy for genetic association tests, increased power to discover causal genetic variants, and the ability to provide accurate summaries of model uncertainty using both simulated and real data examples.",

Only if outcomes are contingent on our choices can we make meaningful value-based decisions. Here, we investigate the effect of outcome contingency on the neural coding of rewards and tasks. Participants performed a reversal-learning task in which reward outcomes were contingent on trial-by-trial choices, and performed a  free choice task in which rewards were random and not contingent on choices. We hypothesized that contingent outcomes enhance the neural coding of rewards and tasks, which was tested using multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data. Reward outcomes were encoded in a large network including the striatum, dmPFC and parietal cortex, and these representations were indeed amplified for contingent rewards. Tasks were encoded in the dmPFC at the time of decision-making, and in parietal cortex in a subsequence maintenance phase. We found no evidence for contingency-dependent modulations of task signals, demonstrating highly similar coding across contingency conditions. Our findings suggest selective effects of contingency on reward coding only, and further highlight the role of dmPFC and parietal cortex in value-based decision-making, as these were the only regions strongly involved in both reward and task coding.",

    "abstract": "The manipulation of pattern generators in order to impose temporal organization on target nodes while accounting for dynamic changes in behavior and cognitive demand remains a significant challenge for the use of neurostimulation as a therapeutic treatment option. While perturbation through optogentic stimulation can reveal circuit mechanisms that create and locally integrate temporal organization, it is unclear whether superseding endogenous signals with artificial oscillations would benefit or impede hippocampus-dependent cognition or how cognitive demand might affect artificial septo-hippocampal entrainment. Optogenetic MS stimulation in wild-type rats in 3 conditions showed that septal input is more likely to supersede endogenous hippocampal LFP oscillations when animals are at rest or performing a hippocampus-dependent spatial accuracy task. Stimulation during a hippocampus-independent task, however, resulted in compensatory endogenous oscillations. Although stimulation effects on the inter-spike interval of hippocampal pyramidal cells mirrored task-conditional theta entrainment of the LFP, place field properties were unaffected. Analyses of spatial behavior indicate that optogenetic stimulation can attenuate performance and specific measures of goal zone estimation accuracy but otherwise does not affect the rats ability to navigate to the target quadrant. The results suggest that the behavioral effect of temporally organizing the septo-hippocampal circuit relative to an artificial theta signal is limited to the accuracy of the rats approximation of the goal zone location. These results have significant implications for the therapeutic use of optogenetic stimulation as a means of attenuating cognitive deficits associated with temporal discoordination.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe identification of bona fide microbial taxa in microbiomes derived from ancient and historical samples is complicated by the unavoidable mixture between DNA from ante- and post-mortem microbial colonizers. One possibility to distinguish between these sources of microbial DNA is querying for the presence of age-associated degradation patterns typical of ancient DNA (aDNA). The presence of uracils, resulting from cytosine deamination, has been detected ubiquitously in aDNA retrieved from diverse sources, and used as an authentication criterion. Here, we employ a library preparation method that separates molecules that carry uracils from those that do not for a set of samples that includes Neandertal remains, herbarium specimens and archaeological plant remains.\n\nResultsWe show that sequencing DNA libraries enriched in molecules carrying uracils effectively amplifies age associated degradation patterns in microbial mixtures of ancient and historical origin. This facilitates the discovery of authentic ancient microbial taxa in cases where degradation patterns are difficult to detect due to large sequence divergence in microbial mixtures. Additionally, the relative enrichment of taxa in the uracil enriched fraction can help to identify bona fide ancient microbial taxa that could be missed using a more targeted approach.\n\nConclusionsOur experiments show, that in addition to its use in enriching authentic endogenous DNA of organisms of interest, the selective enrichment of damaged DNA molecules can be a valuable tool in the discovery of ancient microbial taxa.",

Furthermore, the sulcal organization influences the location of the vmPFC peak of the Default Mode Network, demonstrating that the location of functional activity can be affected by local sulcal patterns.

The present study provides a complete description of the inter-individual variability of anatomical morphology of this large portion of prefrontal cortex and its relation to functional organization. We have shown that two supplementary medial sulci predominantly determine the organization of the vmPFC, which in turn affect the location of the functional peak of activity in this region.

    "abstract": "Rapid identification of bacterial pathogens is crucial for appropriate and adequate antibiotic treatment, which significantly improves patient outcomes. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing has proven to be a powerful strategy for diagnosing bacterial infections. We have recently established a sequencing method and bioinformatics pipeline for 16S rRNA gene analysis utilizing the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer. In combination with our taxonomy annotation analysis pipeline, the system enabled the molecular detection of bacterial DNA in a reasonable timeframe for diagnostic purposes. However, purification of bacterial DNA from specimens remains a rate-limiting step in the workflow. To further accelerate the process of sample preparation, we adopted a direct PCR strategy that amplifies 16S rRNA genes from bacterial cell suspensions without DNA purification. Our results indicate that differences in cell wall morphology significantly affect direct PCR efficiency and sequencing data. Notably, mechanical cell disruption preceding direct PCR was indispensable for obtaining an accurate representation of the specimen bacterial composition. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene analysis of mock polymicrobial samples indicated that primer sequence optimization is required to avoid preferential detection of particular taxa and to cover a broad range of bacterial species. This study establishes a relatively simple workflow for rapid bacterial identification via MinIONTM sequencing, which reduces the turnaround time from sample to result, and provides a reliable method that may be applicable to clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Direct electron uptake by prokaryotes is a recently described mechanism with a potential application for energy and CO2 storage into value added chemicals. Members of Methanosarcinales, an environmentally and biotechnologically relevant group of methanogens, were previously shown to retrieve electrons from an extracellular electrogenic partner performing Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer (DIET) and were therefore proposed to be electroactive. However, their intrinsic electroactivity has never been examined. In this study, we tested two methanogens belonging to the genus Methanosarcina, M. barkeri and M. horonobensis, regarding their ability to accept electrons directly from insoluble electron donors like other cells, conductive particles and electrodes. Both methanogens were able to retrieve electrons from Geobacter metallireducens via DIET. Furthermore, DIET was also stimulated upon addition of electrically conductive granular activated carbon (GAC) when each was co-cultured with G. metallireducens. However, when provided with a cathode poised at -400 mV (vs. SHE), only M. barkeri could perform electromethanogenesis. In contrast, the strict hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanobacterium formicicum, did not produce methane regardless of the type of insoluble electron donor provided (Geobacter cells, GAC or electrodes). A comparison of functional gene categories between the two Methanosarcina showed differences regarding energy metabolism, which could explain dissimilarities concerning electromethanogenesis at fixed potentials. We suggest that these dissimilarities are minimized in the presence of an electrogenic DIET partner (e.g. Geobacter), which can modulate its surface redox potentials by adjusting the expression of electroactive surface proteins.",

    "abstract": "The mutualistic symbiont Vibrio fischeri builds a symbiotic biofilm during colonization of squid hosts. Regulation of the exopolysaccharide component, termed Syp, has been examined in strain ES114, where production is controlled by a phosphorelay that includes the inner membrane hybrid histidine kinase RscS. Most strains that lack RscS or encode divergent RscS proteins cannot colonize a squid host unless RscS from a squid symbiont is heterologously expressed. In this study, we examine V. fischeri isolates worldwide to understand the landscape of biofilm regulation during beneficial colonization. We provide a detailed study of three distinct evolutionary groups of V. fischeri and find that while the RscS-Syp biofilm pathway is required in one of the groups, two other groups of squid symbionts require Syp independent of RscS. Mediterranean squid symbionts, including V. fischeri SR5, colonize without an RscS homolog encoded in their genome. Additionally, Group A V. fischeri strains, which form a tightly-related clade of Hawaii isolates, have a frameshift in rscS and do not require the gene for squid colonization or competitive fitness. These same strains have a frameshift in sypE, and we provide evidence that this Group A sypE allele leads to an upregulation in biofilm activity. This work thus describes the central importance of Syp biofilm in colonization of diverse isolates, and demonstrates that significant evolutionary transitions correspond to regulatory changes in the syp pathway.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBiofilms are surface-associated, matrix-encased bacterial aggregates that exhibit enhanced protection to antimicrobial agents. Previous work has established the importance of biofilm formation by a strain of luminous Vibrio fischeri bacteria as the bacteria colonize their host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid. In this study, expansion of this work to many natural isolates revealed that biofilm genes are universally required, yet there has been a shuffling of the regulators of those genes. This work provides evidence that even when bacterial behaviors are conserved, dynamic regulation of those behaviors can underlie evolution of the host colonization phenotype. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of investigating natural diversity as we seek to understand molecular mechanisms in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Enzyme behavior has been described using the Michaelis-Menten mechanism. The analysis of extended time domains provides a means to extract the Michaelis-Menten constants through direct fitting of raw data. We have developed a scheme for determining Michaelis-Menten rate constants by appropriate fitting of multidimensional experimental data sets to the closed form of the Michaelis-Menten model. We considered how varying parameters in experimental data affect the accuracy of the remaining parameter estimates. We determine how to improve experimental design to achieve a given accuracy, relative to the amount of intrinsic or external error. We analyze this scheme on data sets built around 20 hypothetical and 2 natural enzymes (kinesin and apyrase) to test error sensitivity in different parameter regimes. Overall, we provide evidence that our data fitting regime will tolerate significant experimental error in the raw data and still converge on the four Michaelis-Menten constants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and confusion. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid-based early detection is limited in sensitivity and specificity as well as by cost. Therefore, detecting AD from blood cell analysis could improve early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The present study aimed to identify blood cell transcripts that reflect brain expression levels of factors linked to AD progression.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed blood cell and brain microarray gene expression datasets from NCBI-GEO for AD association and expression in blood and brain. We also used eQTL and epigenetics data to identify AD-related genes that were regulated similarly in blood and brain.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 9 differentially expressed genes (DEG; AD versus controls) common to blood cells and brain (CNBD1, SUCLG2-AS1, CCDC65, PDE4D, MTMR1, C3, SLC6A15, LINC01806, and FRG1JP) and 18 genes (HSD17B1, GAS5, RPS5, VKORC1, GLE1, WDR1, RPL12, MORN1, RAD52, SDR39U1, NPHP4, MT1E, SORD, LINC00638, MCM3AP-AS1, GSDMD, RPS9, and GNL2) that were commonly dysregulated between AD blood and brain tissues using SNP and cis-eQTL data. This data revealed significant neurodegeneration-associated molecular pathways in the ribosomal and complement systems. Integration of these different analyses revealed dys-regulation of hub transcription factors (SREBF2, NR1H2, NR1H3, PRDM1, XBP1) and microRNAs (miR-518e, miR-518a-3p, miR-518b, miR-518c, miR-518d-3p and miR-518f) in AD. Several significant histone modification sites in DEGs were also identified.\\n\\nConclusionWe have identified new putative links between pathological processes in brain and transcripts in blood cells in AD subjects that may enable the use of blood to diagnose and monitor AD onset and progression.",

    "abstract": "Neural systems are inherently noisy, and this noise can affect our perception from moment to moment. This is particularly apparent in binocular rivalry, where our perception of competing stimuli shown to the left and right eyes alternates over time in a seemingly random fashion. We investigated internal noise using binocular rivalry by modulating rivalling stimuli using dynamic sequences of external noise of various rates and amplitudes. As well as measuring the effect on dominance durations, we repeated each external noise sequence twice, and assessed the consistency of percepts across repetitions. External noise modulations with standard deviations above 4% contrast increased consistency scores above baseline, and were most effective at 1/8Hz. A computational model of rivalry in which internal noise has a 1/f (pink) temporal amplitude spectrum, and a standard deviation of 16%, provided the best account of our data, and was able to correctly predict perception in additional conditions. Our novel technique provides detailed estimates of the dynamic properties of internal noise during binocular rivalry, and by extension the stochastic processes that drive our perception and other types of spontaneous brain activity.\\n\\nSignificance statementAlthough our perception of the world appears constant, sensory representations are variable because of the  noisy nature of biological neurons. Here we used a binocular rivalry paradigm, in which conflicting images are shown to the two eyes, to probe the properties of this internal variability. Using a novel paradigm in which the contrasts of rivalling stimuli are modulated by two independent external noise streams, we infer the amplitude and character of this internal noise. The temporal amplitude spectrum of the noise has a 1/f spectrum, similar to that of natural visual input, and consistent with the idea that the visual system evolved to match its environment.",

We here leverage a highly specific and targeted rapid PCR methodology to quantitatively assess the genomic landscape of centromeres in cancer cell lines and primary tissue. PCR-based profiling of centromeres revealed widespread heterogeneity of centromeric and pericentromeric sequences in cancer cells and tissue as compared to healthy counterparts. Quantitative reductions in select centromeric core and pericentromeric markers were observed in neoplastic samples as compared to healthy counterparts. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of a pericentromeric endogenous retrovirus amplified by PCR revealed possible gene conversion events occurring at numerous pericentromeric loci in the setting of malignancy. Our findings collectively represent the first look into centromere genetics in the setting of malignancy, providing valuable insight into the evolution and reshuffling of centromeric sequences in cancer development and progression.",

    "abstract": "The 3D fold determination of proteins by computational algorithms guided by experimental restraints is a reliable and efficient approach. However, the current algorithms struggle with sampling the conformational space and scaling in performance with the increase in the size of the proteins. This paper demonstrates a new data-driven, time-efficient, heuristics algorithm that assembles the 3D structure of a protein from its elemental super-secondary structure motifs (Smotifs) using a limited number of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) derived restraints. The DINGO-NOE-RDC algorithm (3D assembly of Individual smotifs to Near-native Geometry as Orchestrated by limited nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) and residual dipolar couplings (RDC)) leverages on the distance restraints recorded on methyl-methyl (CH3-CH3), methyl-amide (CH3-HN), and amide-amide (HN-HN) NOE contacts, and orientation restraints recorded via RDC on the backbone amide protons, to assemble the targets Smotifs. Two conceptual advancements were made to bootstrap the structure determination from limited NMR restraints; first, expand the basic definition of a  Smotif and, second, employ a data driven approach for selection, scoring, ranking and clustering of Smotif assemblies. In contrast to existing methods, the DINGO-NOE-RDC algorithm does not use any force-fields, physical/empirical scoring functions or the targets amino-acid sequence makeup. Additionally, the algorithm employs a universal Smotif library that applies to any target protein and, can generate numerically reproducible results. For a benchmark set of ten different targets with different topologies, ranging from 100-200 residues, the algorithm identified near-native Smotifs in all of them.",

    "abstract": "Robustly linking dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) states to behaviour is an important goal of the fledgling research using these methods. Previously, using a sliding window approach, we identified two dynamic connectivity states (DCS) linked to arousal. Here, in an independent dataset, 32 healthy participants underwent two sets of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, once in a well-rested state and once after a single night of total sleep deprivation. Using a temporal differencing method, DFC and clustering analysis on the resting state fMRI data revealed five centroids that were highly correlated with those found in previous work, including the two states associated with high and low arousal. Individual differences in cognitive vulnerability to sleep deprivation were measured using changes in Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) performance (lapses and median reaction speed), Changes in the percentage of time spent in the arousal states from the well-rested to the sleep-deprived condition specifically were correlated with declines in PVT performance. Our results provide good evidence of the validity and reproducibility of DFC measures, particularly with regard to measuring arousal and attention, and are an encouraging base from which to build a chronnectome mapping DCS to cognition.",

    "abstract": "The Shigella species are Gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens that invade the colonic epithelium and cause significant diarrheal disease. Despite extensive research on the pathogen, comprehensive understanding of how Shigella initiates contact with epithelial cells remains unknown. Shigella maintains many of the same Escherichia coli adherence gene operons; however, at least one critical gene component in each operon is currently annotated as a pseudogene in reference genomes. These annotations, coupled with a lack of structures upon microscopic analysis following growth in laboratory media, have led the field to hypothesize that Shigella is unable to produce fimbriae or other \\\"traditional\\\" adherence factors. Nevertheless, our previous analyses have demonstrated that a combination of bile salts and glucose induce both biofilm formation and adherence to colonic epithelial cells. Through a two-part investigation, we first utilized various transcriptomic analyses to demonstrate that S. flexneri strain 2457T adherence gene operons are transcribed. Subsequently, we performed mutation, electron microscopy, biofilm, infection, and proteomic analyses to characterize three of the structural genes. In combination, these studies demonstrate that despite the gene annotations, S. flexneri 2457T uses adherence factors to initiate biofilm formation as well as epithelial cell contact. Furthermore, host factors, namely glucose and bile salts in the small intestine, offer key environmental stimuli required for proper adherence factor expression in S. flexneri. This research may have a significant impact on vaccine development for Shigella and further highlights the importance of utilizing in vivo-like conditions to study bacterial pathogenesis.\\n\\nImportanceBacterial pathogens have evolved to regulate virulence gene expression at critical points in the colonization and infection processes to successfully cause disease. The Shigella species infect the epithelial cells lining the colon to result in millions of cases of diarrhea and a significant global health burden. As antibiotic resistance rates increase, understanding the mechanisms of infection are vital to ensure successful vaccine development. Despite significant gains in our understanding of Shigella infection, it remains unknown how the bacteria initiate contact with the colonic epithelium. Most pathogens harbor multiple adherence factors to facilitate this process, but Shigella was thought to have lost the ability to produce these factors. Interestingly, we have identified conditions that mimic some features of gastrointestinal transit and enable Shigella to express adherence factors. This work highlights aspects of genetic regulation for Shigella adherence factors and may have a significant impact on future vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Abnormally sustained beta-frequency synchronisation between the motor cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN) is associated with motor symptoms in Parkinsons disease (PD). It is currently unclear whether STN neurons have a preference for beta-frequency input (12-35Hz), rather than cortical input at other frequencies, and how such a preference would arise following dopamine depletion. To address this question, we combined analysis of cortical and STN recordings from awake PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery with recordings of identified STN neurons in anaesthetised rats. In PD patients, we demonstrate that a subset of STN neurons are strongly and selectively sensitive to fluctuations of cortical beta oscillations over time, linearly increasing their phase-locking strength with respect to full range of instantaneous amplitude. In rats, we probed the frequency response of STN neurons more precisely, by recording spikes evoked by short bursts of cortical stimulation with variable frequency (4-40Hz) and constant amplitude. In both healthy and dopamine-depleted animals, only beta-frequency stimulation selectively led to a progressive reduction in the variability of spike timing through the stimulation train. We hypothesize, that abnormal activation of the indirect pathway, via dopamine depletion and/or cortical stimulation, could trigger an underlying sensitivity of the STN microcircuit to beta-frequency input.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesHLA alleles affect susceptibility to more than 100 diseases, but the mechanisms to account for these genotype-disease associations are largely unknown. HLA-alleles strongly influence predisposition to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both AS and RA patients have discrete intestinal and faecal microbiome signatures. Whether these changes are cause or consequence of the diseases themselves is unclear. To distinguish these possibilities, we examine the effect of HLA-B27 and HLA-DRB1 RA-risk alleles on the composition of the intestinal microbiome in healthy individuals.\\n\\nMethods568 samples from 6 intestinal sites were collected from 107 otherwise healthy unrelated subjects and stool samples from 696 twin pairs from the TwinsUK cohort. Microbiome profiling was performed using sequencing of the 16S rRNA bacterial marker gene. All patients were genotyped using the Illumina CoreExome SNP microarray, and HLA genotypes were imputed from these data.\\n\\nResultsAssociation was observed between HLA-B27 genotype, and RA-risk HLA-DRB1 alleles, and overall microbial composition (P=0.0002 and P=0.00001 respectively). These associations were replicated in the TwinsUK cohort stool samples (P=0.023 and P=0.033 respectively).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study shows that the changes in intestinal microbiome composition seen in AS and RA are at least partially due to effects of HLA-B27 and -DRB1 on the gut microbiome. These findings support the hypothesis that HLA alleles operate to cause or increase the risk of these diseases through interaction with the intestinal microbiome, and suggest that therapies targeting the microbiome may be effective in their prevention and/or treatment.",

We tested the hypothesis that environmental adipogens highly ranked by the taxonomy, but segregated from therapeutic PPAR{gamma} ligands, would induce white but not brite adipogenesis.\n\nMethods3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in the presence of 76 chemicals (negative controls, nuclear receptor ligands known to influence adipocyte biology, potential environmental PPAR{gamma} ligands). Differentiation was assessed by measuring lipid accumulation. mRNA expression was determined by RNA-Seq and validated by RT-qPCR. A novel classification model was developed using an amended random forest procedure. A subset of environmental contaminants identified as strong PPAR{gamma} agonists were analyzed by their effects on lipid handling, mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular respiration in 3T3-L1 cells and human preadipocytes.\n\nResultsWe used lipid accumulation and RNA sequencing data to develop a classification system that 1) identified PPAR{gamma} agonists, and 2) sorted chemicals into likely white or brite adipogens. Expression of Cidec was the most efficacious indicator of strong PPAR{gamma} activation. Two known environmental PPAR{gamma} ligands, tetrabromobisphenol A and triphenyl phosphate, which sorted distinctly from therapeutic ligands, induced white adipocyte genes but failed to induce Pgc1a and Ucp1, and induced fatty acid uptake but not mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, two chemicals identified as highly ranked PPAR{gamma} agonists, tonalide and quinoxyfen, induced white adipogenesis without the concomitant health-promoting characteristics of brite adipocytes in mouse and human preadipocytes.\n\nDiscussionA novel classification procedure accurately identified environmental chemicals as PPAR{gamma} ligands distinct from known PPAR{gamma}-activating therapeutics. The computational and experimental framework has general applicability to the classification of as-yet uncharacterized chemicals.",

    "abstract": "A strategy for treating the most common type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) applies a targeted therapy using venom peptides that are selective for ion channels and transporters overexpressed in tumor cells. Here, we report selective anti-HCC properties of Tv1, a venom peptide from the predatory marine terebrid snail, Terebra variegata. Tv1 was applied in vitro to liver cancer cells and administered in vivo to allograft tumor mouse models. Tv1 inhibited the proliferation of murine HCC cells via calcium dependent apoptosis resulting from down-regulation of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway. Additionally, tumor sizes were significantly reduced in Tv1-treated syngeneic tumor-bearing mice. Tv1s mechanism of action involves binding to specific transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels that are overexpressed in HCC cell models. Our findings demonstrate the unique potential of venom peptides to function as tumor specific ligands in the quest for targeted cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and subsequent differentiation into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCM) seems to be a promising strategy for cardiac regenerative therapy. However, recent failure or poor outcomes in cardiac cell therapy warrants further investigation focusing on the infarction/wound environment (site of healing) to improve the cardiac regenerative medicine. Here, using next generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed the global transcriptome to discover the unidentified genes/pathways that are crucial for cell survival, cytoprotection and mitochondrial dynamics during the differentiation of iPSC into iCM.\\n\\nMethodsHigh throughput NGS was performed RNA from human iPSCs and iCMs (n=3/group) and analyzed the global changes in the transcriptome during differentiation. Furthermore, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Ontology (GO) for biological process were performed to understand the transcriptional networks that are involved during iCM differentiation. RNA-seq data were further validated by qRT-PCR analyses.\\n\\nResultsGlobal transcriptome analysis revealed that ~9,290 genes (log2 FC >2) were significantly altered in human iCMs compared to the parent iPSCs, in which 4,784 transcripts were substantially upregulated and 4,506 transcripts were down-regulated during differentiation. GO enrichment and IPA analyses revealed the top 10 regulatory networks (i.e. hierarchical order) involved in differentiation of iCMs including cardiomyocyte remodeling, integrin-linked kinase signaling, Rho family of GTPases, etc. Surprisingly, none of the top 10 pathways listed the genes liable for redox signaling networks that are crucial for the basal cellular redox homeostasis, Nrf2-dependent antioxidant defense, mitochondrial functions and cell survival. Our deeper and unbiased analysis of this data revealed that the genes involved in above canonical signaling pathways are found in the middle of the inverted vertical cone. Of note, although these pathways are significantly altered during the differentiation (of iPS into cardiomyocytes), a majority of them are ranked low in the hierarchical list (>150). Validation of the randomly selected genes representing various pathways real-time qPCR confirmed the global transcriptome changes observed in NGS.\\n\\nConclusionWe highlight the significance of Nrf2-redox and mitochondrial transcriptome during differentiation of iPSC into iCMs. Thus, targeting the redox signaling mechanisms in iCMs may enhance their efficiency for cell therapy and improved myocardial repair.",

    "abstract": "The study of functional brain networks has grown rapidly over the past decade. While most functional connectivity (FC) analyses estimate one static network structure for the entire length of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, recently there has been increased interest in studying time-varying changes in FC. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be a useful modeling approach for discovering repeating graphs of interacting brain regions (brain states). However, a limitation lies in HMMs assuming that the sojourn time, the number of consecutive time points in a state, is geometrically distributed. This may encourage inaccurate estimation of the time spent in a state before switching to another state. We propose a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) approach for inferring time-varying brain networks from fMRI data, which explicitly models the sojourn distribution. Specifically, we propose using HSMMs to find each subjects most probable series of network states and the graphs associated with each state, while properly estimating and modeling the sojourn distribution for each state. We perform a simulation study, as well as an analysis on both task-based fMRI data from an anxiety-inducing experiment and resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results demonstrate the importance of model choice when estimating sojourn times and reveal their potential for understanding healthy and diseased brain mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "All cells maintain ionic gradients across their plasma membranes, producing transmembrane potentials (Vmem). Mounting evidence suggests a relationship between resting Vmem and the physiology of non-excitable cells with implications in diverse areas, including cancer, cellular differentiation, and body patterning. A lack of non-invasive methods to record absolute Vmem limits our understanding of this fundamental signal. To address this need, we developed a fluorescence lifetime-based approach (VF-FLIM) to visualize and optically quantify Vmem with single-cell resolution. Using VF-FLIM, we report Vmem distributions over thousands of cells, a 100-fold improvement relative to electrophysiological approaches. In human carcinoma cells, we visualize the voltage response to epidermal growth factor stimulation, stably recording a 10-15 mV hyperpolarization over minutes. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we identify the source of the hyperpolarization as the Ca2+-activated K+ channel Kca3.1. The ability to optically quantify absolute Vmem with cellular resolution will allow a re-examination of its roles as a cellular signal.",

    "abstract": "Since the early description of different human apolipoprotein A-I variants associated to amyloidosis, the reason that determines its deposition inducing organ failure has been under research. To shed light into the events associated to protein aggregation, we studied the effect of the structural perturbations induced by the replacement of a Leucine in position 60 by an Arginine as it occurs in the natural amyloidogenic variant (L60R). Circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence measurements and assays of binding to ligands indicate that L60R is more unstable, more sensitive to proteolysis and interacts with sodium dodecyl sulfate (a model of negative lipids) more than the protein with the native sequence and other natural variant tested, involving a replacement of a Trytophan by and Arginine in the amino acid 50 (W50R). In addition, the small structural rearrangement observed under physiological pH leads to the release of tumor necrosis factor  and interleukin-l{beta} from a model of macrophages. Our results strongly suggest that the chronic disease may be a consequence of the loss in the native conformation which alters the equilibrium among native and cytotoxic proteins conformation.",

Here, we examined soil bacterial and fungal communities pre/post-N fertilization in an 8 year-old switchgrass field, in which twenty-four plots received N fertilization at three levels (0, 100, and 200 kg N ha-1 as NH4NO3) for the first time since planting. Soils were collected at two depths, 0-5 and 5-15 cm, for DNA extraction and amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and ITS regions, and soil metagenomic analysis. Baseline assessment prior to fertilization revealed no pre-existing differences in either bacterial or fungal communities across plots. The one-time N fertilization increased switchgrass yields and tissue N content, and the added N was nearly completely removed from the soil of fertilized plots by the end of the growing season. Both bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities showed large spatial (by depth) and temporal variation (by season) within each plot, accounting for 17 and 12-22 % of the variation in bacterial/archaeal and fungal community composition, respectively. While N fertilization effects accounted for only ~4% of overall variation, some specific microbial groups, including the bacterial genus Pseudonocardia and the fungal genus Archaeorhizomyces, were notably repressed by fertilization at 200 kg N ha-1. Bacterial groups varied with both depth in the soil profile and time of sampling, while temporal variability shaped the fungal community more significantly than vertical heterogeneity in the soil. Thus, variability within the field might override the changes induced by N addition. Continued analyses of these trends over time with fertilization and management are needed to understand whether these transient effects change over time.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic pressures, such as contaminant exposure, may affect stable isotope ratios in biota. These changes are driven by alterations in the nutrient allocation and metabolic pathways induced by specific stressors. In a controlled microcosm study with the amphipod Gammarus spp., we studied effects of the {beta}-blocker propranolol on stable isotope signatures ({delta}15N and {delta}13C), elemental composition (%C and %N), and growth (protein content and body size) as well as biomarkers of oxidative status (antioxidant capacity, ORAC; lipid peroxidation, TBARS) and neurological activity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE). Based on the known effects of propranolol exposure on cellular functions, i.e., its mode of action (MOA), we expected to observe a lower scope for growth, accompanied by a decrease in protein deposition, oxidative processes and AChE inhibition, with a resulting increase in the isotopic signatures. The observed responses supported most of these predictions. In particular, %N was positively affected by propranolol, whereas both protein allocation and body size declined. Moreover, both ORAC and TBARS levels decreased with increasing propranolol concentration, with the decrease being more pronounced for TBARS, which indicates the prevalence of the antioxidative processes. These changes resulted in a significant increase of the {delta}15N and {delta}13C values in the propranolol-exposed animals compared to the control. These findings suggest that MOA of {beta}-blockers may be used to predict sublethal effects in nontarget species, including inhibited AChE activity, improved oxidative balance, and elevated stable isotope ratios. The latter also indicates that metabolism-driven responses to environmental contaminants can alter stable isotope signatures, which should be taken into account when interpreting trophic interactions in the food webs.",

Here, we report a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of wheat based on the genome-wide resequencing of 120 representative landraces and elite wheat accessions from China and other representative regions. We found substantially higher genetic diversity in the A and B subgenomes than in the D subgenome. Notably, the A and B subgenomes of the modern Chinese elite cultivars were mainly derived from European landraces, while Chinese landraces had a greater contribution to their D subgenomes. The duplicated copies of homoeologous genes from the A, B, and D subgenomes were commonly found to be under different levels of selection.

    "abstract": "Leptospirosis is an overlooked zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira. The kidney is the major organ infected by Leptospira which causes tubulointerstitial nephritis. Leptospira outer membrane components contain several virulence factors that play important roles in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. Among them, OmpA-like protein Loa22 is essential for leptospiral virulence. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of tubulointerstitial nephritis involving this virulence factor are still unclear and need further investigation. In this study, pull-down assays suggested that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) proteins interacted with Loa22 from Leptospira outer membrane extractions. Combination of Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and side-directed mutagenesis suggested that Loa22 exhibited high affinity for Leptospira peptidoglycan (LPGN) and the residues of Loa22 were involved in LPGN interaction. Mutation of two key residues within the OmpA-like domain of Loa22, Asp122 and Arg143, significantly attenuated their relative affinities for LPGN indicating that these two residues were responsible for LPGN binding. Thus Loa22 OmpA domain was responsible for interacting with LPGN and the two indicated residues may participate in binding to LPGN. Recombinant Loa22 (rLoa22) protein was further complexed with LPGN and incubated with HEK293-TLR2 cells to monitor inflammatory responses. Inflammatory responses were provoked by rLoa22-LPGN complexes, but not rLoa22 alone, involved CXCL8/IL8, hCCL2/MCP-1, and hTNF- activation. Confocal microscopy further identified the co-localization of Loa22-LPGN complexes and TLR2 receptors on HEK293-TLR2 cell surface. The affinity between Loa22-LPGN complexes and TLR2 were further confirmed and measured by AFM and ELISA. Downstream signals from TLR2 including p38, ERK, and JNK were observed by western blotting induced by Loa22-LPGN complexes. In summary, this study identified LPGN in leptospira mediates interactions between Loa22 and TLR2 and induces downstream signals to trigger inflammatory responses. Interactions between Loa22-LPGN-TLR2 reveal a novel binding mechanism for the innate immune system and infection induced by leptospira.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLeptospirosis is one of the most overlooked zoonotic diseases caused by pathogenic Leptospira in warm and humid regions worldwide. With the infection by Leptospira, many organs are invaded and can result in multiple-organ failure (Weils syndrome). Kidney is the major organ infected by pathogenic Leptospira, which would manifest as tubulointerstitial nephritis. In this study, we focused on the outer membrane lipoprotein Loa22 (Leptospiral OmpA-like domain 22) from pathogenic Leptospira which triggers inflammatory responses on renal tubular cell. Protein domain prediction indicated that Loa22 contains an important domain termed OmpA-like domain and the function of this domain is peptidoglycan (PGN) binding. From sequence alignments of Loa22 with other OmpA proteins, two important amino acids, Asp122 and Arg143, were found to be highly conserved. The role of the two conserved residues in AbOmpA (OmpA protein in A. baumannii) and Pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein in E. coli) proteins are important for PGN binding. These two residues in Loa22 were altered by site-directed mutagenesis to obtain D122A and R143A variants. In pull-down and AFM analysis, the binding capacities of Loa22 variants to Leptospira PGN (LPGN) were significantly decreased as compared to rLoa22WT, indicating that the two residues are involved in LPGN binding. Furthermore, recombinant Loa22 and its variants in the absence or presence of LPGN, were incubated with HEK293-TLR2 cells, to confirm the role of LPGN in triggering inflammatory responses involving CXCL8/IL8, hCCL2/MCP-1, and hTNF-. These factors are involved in downstream signaling of inflammatory responses through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). In addition, confocal microscopy was employed to observe the co-localization of Loa22-LPGN complexes and TLR2 receptors on HEK293-TLR2 cell surfaces. Finally, the interaction forces between rTLR2 and rLoa22-LPGN complexes were measured by AFM and ELISA to conclude the necessary role of LPGN in rLoa22-TLR2 complex formation. In summary, these results demonstrate that the interaction of Loa22 protein with the important cell wall component, PGN, concomitantly triggered inflammatory responses of host cells through interaction with TLR2.",

Most (60.2%) of the respondents had antenatal care attendance and majority of them did so at public hospitals. Approximately 43.8% of the respondents were delivered by the skilled birth attendants. The common determinants of birth place were nearness of the health facilities, familiarity of healthcare providers, improved services, sudden labour onset and cost. Also 61.7% of the respondents chose to deliver in public health facilities due to favourable reasons but this could be hampered by the rudeness of some healthcare providers at such facilities. A significant proportion of private health facilities had unskilled manpower and shortage of drugs.\\n\\nConclusionA greater proportion of women will prefer to deliver in health facilities.

    "abstract": "Serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by diacylglycerol that is released from membrane lipids by phospholipase C in response to activation of G protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases. PKC isoforms are particularly relevant for proliferation and differentiation of cells including osteoblasts. Osteoblasts/osteocytes produce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone regulating renal phosphate and vitamin D handling. PKC activates NF{kappa}B, a transcription factor complex controlling FGF23 expression. Here, we analyzed the impact of PKC on FGF23 synthesis. Fgf23 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in UMR106 osteoblastlike cells and in IDG-SW3 osteocytes. Phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, up-regulated Fgf23 expression. In contrast, PKC inhibitors calphostin C, Go6976, sotrastaurin and ruboxistaurin supressed Fgf23 gene expression. NF{kappa}B inhibitor withaferin A abolished the stimulatory effect of PMA on Fgf23. PKC is a powerful regulator of FGF23 synthesis, an effect which is at least partly mediated by NF{kappa}B.",

    "abstract": "Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry have facilitated the incorporation of proteomic studies to many biology experimental workflows. In particular, the introduction of Data-Independent Acquisition platforms, such as SWATH, offers several advantages for label-free quantitative assessment of complex proteomes over Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) approaches. However, SWATH data interpretation requires spectral libraries as a reference resource. This is often not available for many species of experimental models. The guinea pig (cavia porcellus) is an excellent experimental model for translation to many aspects of human physiology and disease yet there is limited experimental information regarding its proteome. In an effort to overcome this knowledge gap, we generated a comprehensive spectral library of the guinea pig proteome. Homogenates and tryptic peptide digests were prepared from 16 tissues and subjected to >200 DDA runs. Analysis of >250,000 peptide-spectrum matches resulted in the construction of a library of 73594 peptides corresponding to 7667 proteins. This spectral library furnishes the research community with the first comprehensive guinea pig proteomic resource that will facilitate future molecular-phenotypic studies using (re-engaging) the guinea pig as an experimental model of relevance to human biology. The guinea pig spectral library and MS data are freely accessible in the MassIVE repository (MSV000083199).",

    "abstract": "The initiation of lactation challenges the ability of the modern lactating cow to maintain calcium homeostasis, and typically results in a drop in blood calcium levels; leading to mobilization of calcium reserves from skeletal stores. As such, the recommendation to provide supplemental calcium at parturition to older cows has become an industry-standard practice. Mature cows were treated at calving and 12 hours later with either the novel calcium bolus (NB), or a commercially available calcium bolus (CB). Blood was collected from animals at 0, 1, 6, 12, 13, and 24 hours following calving, and the resulting serum samples were analyzed. Overall, there was no statistical difference between the NB and CB groups for blood calcium levels within the first 24 hours following parturition (P = 0.50). Cows in both groups experienced a significant increase in serum calcium by 1 hour after parturition; however, this increase was not sustained through subsequent sampling times. This pilot study demonstrates that both boluses have a similar effect in the elevation of blood calcium.",

    "abstract": "UNC-6/Netrin is a conserved axon guidance cue that directs growth cone migrations in the dorsal-ventral axis of C. elegans and in the vertebrate spinal cord. UNC-6/Netrin is expressed in ventral cells, and growth cones migrate ventrally toward or dorsally away from UNC-6/Netrin. Recent studies of growth cone behavior during outgrowth in vivo in C. elegans have led to a polarity/protrusion model in directed growth cone migration away from UNC-6/Netrin. In this model, UNC-6/Netrin first polarizes the growth cone via the UNC-5 receptor, leading to dorsally biased protrusion and F-actin accumulation. UNC-6/Netrin then regulates protrusion based on this polarity. The receptor UNC-40/DCC drives protrusion dorsally, away from the UNC-6/Netrin source, and the UNC-5 receptor inhibits protrusion ventrally, near the UNC-6/Netrin source, resulting in dorsal migration. UNC-5 inhibits protrusion in part by excluding microtubules from the growth cone, which are pro-protrusive. Here we report that the RHO-1/RhoA GTPase and its activator GEF RHGF-1 inhibit growth cone protrusion and MT accumulation in growth cones, similar to UNC-5. However, growth cone polarity of protrusion and F-actin were unaffected by RHO-1 and RHGF-1. Thus, RHO-1 signaling acts specifically as a negative regulator of protrusion and MT accumulation, and not polarity. Genetic interactions suggest that RHO-1 and RHGF-1 act with UNC-5, as well as with a parallel pathway, to regulate protrusion. The cytoskeletal interacting molecule UNC-33/CRMP was required for RHO-1 activity to inhibit MT accumulation, suggesting that UNC-33/CRMP might act downstream of RHO-1. In sum, these studies describe a new role of RHO-1 and RHGF-1 in regulation of growth cone protrusion by UNC-6/Netrin.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeural circuits are formed by precise connections between axons. During axon formation, the growth cone leads the axon to its proper target in a process called axon guidance. Growth cone outgrowth involves asymmetric protrusion driven by extracellular cues that stimulate and inhibit protrusion. How guidance cues regulate growth cone protrusion in neural circuit formation is incompletely understood. This work shows that the signaling molecule RHO-1 acts downstream of the UNC-6/Netrin guidance cue to inhibit growth cone protrusion in part by excluding microtubules from the growth cone, which are structural elements that drive protrusion.",

Was a cross-sectional retrospective study carried out with 122 individuals (45.8 {+/-} 13.0 years, 50 men) who practiced cyclic exercises (running, walking or cycling) randomly recruited in six regions which the city was geographically divided.

The Drosophila homologue, dIno80, is involved in homeotic gene regulation during development as a canonical Pho-dIno80 complex. Previously, we found that dIno80 regulates homeotic genes by interacting with epigenetic regulators, such as polycomb and trithorax, suggesting the occurrence of non-canonical Ino80 complexes. Here using spectroscopic methods and gel retardation assays, we identified a set of consensus DNA sequences that DNA binding domain of dIno80 (DBINO) interacts with having differential affinity and high specificity. Testing these sequences in reporter assays, showed that this interaction can positively regulate transcription. These results suggest that, dIno80 has a sequence preference for interaction with DNA leading to transcriptional changes.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe chromatin remodeling proteins control gene expression by nucleosome sliding and exchange. They are known to function as multi-subunit complexes recruited to chromatin by transcription factors or histone modification readers. Here, we report a sequence specific binding potential for the chromatin remodeler, dIno80. We have carried out in vitro studies with DNA binding domain of dIno80 to elucidate its sequence specific DNA binding. We have also showed that this binding can regulated reporter gene expression in Drosophila cells. Our results suggest a non-canonical role of Ino80 in transcriptional regulation.",

Natural inbreeding had no effect on the plasticity of physiological responses, using either multivariate approaches or analysis of variation in individual metabolites.

To identify genetic variants associated with nephrolithiasis we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analysis in British and Japanese populations, including 12,123 nephrolithiasis cases and 416,928 controls. Twenty loci associated with nephrolithiasis were identified, ten of which are novel. A novel CYP24A1 locus is predicted to affect vitamin D metabolism and five loci, DGKD, DGKH, WDR72, GPIC1, and BCR, are predicted to influence calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) signaling. In a validation cohort of nephrolithiasis patients the CYP24A1-associated locus correlated with serum calcium concentration and number of kidney stone episodes, and the DGKD-associated locus correlated with urinary calcium excretion. Moreover, DGKD knockdown impaired CaSR-signal transduction in vitro, an effect that was rectifiable with the calcimimetic cinacalcet. Our findings indicate that genotyping may inform risk of incident kidney stone disease prior to vitamin D supplementation and facilitate precision-medicine approaches, by targeting CaSR-signaling or vitamin D activation pathways in patients with recurrent kidney stones.",

This bacterium attacks and invades other Gram-negative bacteria, including animal and plant pathogens. The intriguing life cycle of B. bacteriovorus consists of two phases: a free-living non-replicative attack phase wherein the predatory bacterium searches for its prey, and a reproductive phase, in which B. bacteriovorus degrades a hosts macromolecules and reuses them for its own growth and chromosome replication. Although the cell biology of this predatory bacterium has gained considerable interest in recent years, we know almost nothing about the dynamics of chromosome replication in B. bacteriovorus. Here, we performed a real-time investigation into the subcellular localization of the replisome(s) in single cells of B. bacteriovorus. Our results confirm that in B. bacteriovorus chromosome replication fires only during the reproductive phase, and show for the first time that this predatory bacterium exhibits a novel spatiotemporal arrangement of chromosome replication. The replication process starts at the invasive pole of the predatory bacterium inside the prey cell and proceeds until several copies of the chromosome have been completely synthesized. This chromosome replication is not coincident with the predator-cell division, and it terminates shortly before synchronous predator-filament septation occurs. In addition, we demonstrate that if this lifecycle fails in some cells of B. bacteriovorus, they can instead use two prey cells sequentially to complete their life cycle.\\n\\nImportanceNew strategies are needed to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Application of the predatory bacterium, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, which kills other bacteria including pathogens, is considered promising for bacterial infections.

    "abstract": "Bioinformatics tools for fusion transcript detection from RNA-sequencing data are in general developed for identification of novel fusions, which demands a high number of supporting reads and strict filters to avoid false discoveries. As our knowledge of bona-fide fusion genes becomes more saturated, there is a need to establish their prevalence with high sensitivity. We present ScaR, a tool that uses a scaffold realignment approach for sensitive fusion detection in RNA-seq data. ScaR detects a set of 50 synthetic fusion transcripts from simulated data at a higher sensitivity compared to established fusion finders. Applied to fusion transcripts potentially involved in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), ScaR detects the fusions RCC1-ABHD12B and CLEC6A-CLEC4D in 9% and 28% of 150 TGCTs, respectively. The fusions were not detected in any of 198 normal testis tissues. Thus, we demonstrate high prevalence of RCC1-ABHD12B and CLEC6A-CLEC4D in TGCTs, and their cancer specific features. Further, we find that RCC1-ABHD12B and CLEC6A-CLEC4D are predominantly expressed in the seminoma and embryonal carcinoma histological subtypes of TGCTs, respectively. In conclusion, ScaR is useful for establishing the frequency of known fusion transcripts in larger data sets and detecting clinically relevant fusion transcripts with high sensitivity.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/senzhaocode/ScaR",

    "abstract": "Over a billion people suffer from chronic liver diseases worldwide, which often leads to fibrosis and then cirrhosis. Treatments for fibrosis remain experimental, in part because no unifying mechanism has been identified that initiates liver fibrosis. Here we report that O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification protects against hepatocyte necroptosis and initiation of liver fibrosis. Decreased O-GlcNAc levels were seen in patients with liver cirrhosis and in mice with ethanol-induced liver injury. Liver-specific O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) knockout (OGT-LKO) mice exhibited ballooning degeneration and elevated circulating alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels at an early age and progressed to liver fibrosis and portal inflammation by 10 weeks of age. OGT-deficient hepatocytes underwent excessive necroptosis and exhibited elevated protein expression levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), which are key mediators of necroptosis. Furthermore, glycosylation of RIPK3 by OGT reduced RIPK3 protein stability. Taken together, these findings identify OGT as a key suppressor of hepatocyte necroptosis and OGT-LKO mice may serve as an effective spontaneous genetic model of liver fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Amount and rate of information that may be transferred from one residue to another in a protein is quantified using the transfer entropy concept of information theory. Information transfer from one residue to the second is defined as the decrease in the uncertainty in the second residue due to coupling with past values of the first. Three types of information transfer between pairs of residues are defined: transfer between residues that are (i) close in both space and along the primary protein chain, (ii) close in space but distant along the chain, and (iii) distant in space and along the chain may be distinguished. The widely studied third PDZ domain from the synaptic protein PSD-95 is used as an example. The three types of transfer show that residues close in space and chain transfer the largest amount of information. Transfer along the primary chain is also significant. Predictions of the model show that significant amount of transfer may also take place between spatially distant pairs of residues. The latter forms the basis of dynamic allostery in proteins. The role of information transfer between distant pairs in relation to coevolution has been controversial, some works assigning it to near neighbor residue pairs only and others supporting long range coupling. The present paper shows that significant amount of information may be transferred between distant pairs in PSD-95.Transfer rates of the order of gigabytes per second are predicted by the present theory. Information transfer between a specific set of residue pairs exhibit strong directionality, or causality, an observation that may be of use in protein engineering and drug design.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres are repeated sequences found at the end of the linear chromosomes of most eukaryotes and are required for chromosome integrity. They shorten with each cell division because of the end-replication problem. Expression of the reverse transcriptase telomerase allows for extension of telomeric repeats to counteract telomere shortening. Although Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a photosynthetic unicellular green alga, is widely used as a model organism in photosynthesis and flagella research, and for biotechnological applications, the biology of its telomeres has not been investigated in depth. Here, we show that the C. reinhardtii (TTTTAGGG)n telomeric repeats are mostly non-degenerate and that the telomeres form a protective structure, ending with a 3' overhang. While telomere size and length distributions are stable under various standard growth conditions, they vary substantially between 12 genetically close reference strains. Finally, we identify CrTERT, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase and show that mutants of this gene display an \\\"ever shortening telomere\\\" phenotype and eventually enter replicative senescence, demonstrating that telomerase is required for long-term maintenance of telomeres in C. reinhardtii.",

Here, we characterize the Eg5 microtubule polymerase mechanism by assessing motor-induced changes in the longitudinal and lateral tubulin-tubulin bonds that form the microtubule lattice. Isolated Eg5 motor domains promote microtubule nucleation, growth and stability. Eg5 binds preferentially to microtubules over free tubulin, and colchicine-like inhibitors that stabilize the bent conformation of tubulin allosterically inhibit Eg5 binding, consistent with a model in which Eg5 induces a curved-to-straight transition in tubulin. Domain swap experiments establish that the family-specific Loop11, which resides near the nucleotide-sensing Switch-II domain, is necessary and sufficient for the polymerase activity of Eg5. Thus, we propose a microtubule polymerase mechanism in which Eg5 at the plus-end promotes a curved-to-straight transition in tubulin that enhances lateral bond formation and thereby promotes microtubule growth and stability.",

Biosensors, including the redox-sensitive GFP (roGFPs), coupled with intravital microscopy provide a sensitive and dynamic solution to this problem. Here, we utilize a virally-delivered roGFP2-containing human glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1-roGFP2) to selectively monitor {beta}-cell ROS dynamics in vivo in response to toxic glucose analogs. We paired viral biosensor delivery with implanted abdominal imaging windows over the pancreas, thus allowing longitudinal measurements of {beta}-cell ROS and islet area during and after streptozotocin (STZ) exposure.

We have previously reported that murine B cells strongly upregulate cell surface HS upon exposure to type I interferon, TLR-ligands, or B cell receptor stimulation. To investigate the role of HS on B cells in vivo, we utilized EXT1lox/lox CD19-Cre conditional KO mice, which are incapable of synthesizing HS in B cells. We found that suppressing HS expression on B cells has no overt effect in B cell development, localization, or motility. However, we did observe that EXT1 conditional KO mice have decreased poly-reactive IgM in naive aged mice relative to littermate control mice. Despite this decrease in poly-reactive IgM, EXT1 conditional KO mice mounted a normal B cell response to both model antigens and influenza infection. We also observed decreased plasma cells in EXT1 conditional KO mice after influenza infection. Although EXT1 conditional KO mice have decreased plasma cells, these mice still had comparable numbers of influenza-specific antibody secreting cells to littermate control mice. The findings presented here suggest that HS expression on B cells does not play a major role in B cell development or overall B cell function but instead might be involved in fine-tuning B-cell responses.",

The underlying cellular pathophysiology of this disease remains largely unclear. Here, we report novel pathological defects in skeletal muscle fibres of mice and patients with NM, including disrupted nuclear envelope, altered chromatin arrangement, and disorganisation of the cortical cytoskeleton. We demonstrate that such nuclear defects are caused by impairment of muscle fibre contractility, and that cytoskeletal organisation determines nuclear morphology. Our results overlap with findings in diseases caused by mutations in nuclear envelope or cytoskeletal proteins. Given the important role of nuclear shape and envelope in regulating gene expression, and the cytoskeleton in maintaining muscle fibre integrity, our findings are likely to underlie some of the hallmarks of NM, which include broad transcriptional alterations, arrested muscle fibre growth, contractile filament disarray and altered mechanical properties.",

Specifically, we identified regions that preferred particular stimulus categories during localizer scans (e.g. extra-striate body area for bodies), measured multi-vertex patterns for each category during event-related task scans, and then correlated over vertices these stimulus-evoked patterns to the pattern measured on each frame of resting-state scans. The mean correlation coefficient was essentially zero for all regions/stimulus categories, indicating that resting multi-vertex patterns were not biased toward particular stimulus-evoked patterns. However, the spread of correlation coefficients between stimulus-evoked and resting patterns, i.e. both positive and negative, was significantly greater for the preferred stimulus category of an ROI (e.g. body category in body-preferring ROIs). The relationship between spontaneous and stimulus-evoked multi-vertex patterns also governed the temporal correlation or functional connectivity of patterns of spontaneous activity between individual regions (pattern-based functional connectivity). Resting patterns related to an object category fluctuated preferentially between ROIs preferring the same category, and patterns related to different categories fluctuated independently within their respective preferred ROIs (e.g. body- and scene-related multi-vertex patterns within body- and scene-preferring ROIs). These results support the general proposal that spontaneous multi-vertex activity patterns are linked to stimulus-evoked patterns, consistent with a representational function for spontaneous activity.",

    "abstract": "Anticipating meaningful actions in the environment is an essential function of the brain. Such predictive mechanisms originate from the motor system and allow for inferring actions from environmental affordances, the potential to act within a specific environment. Using architecture, we provide a unique perspective to the abiding debate in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy on whether cognition depends on movement or is decoupled from our physical structure. To investigate cognitive processes associated with architectural affordances, we used a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach recording brain activity synchronized to head-mounted virtual reality. Participants perceived and acted upon virtual transitions ranging from non-passable to easily passable. We demonstrate that early sensory brain activity, upon revealing the environment and before actual movement, differed as a function of affordances. Additionally, movement through transitions was preceded by a motor-related negative component also depended on affordances. Our results suggest that potential actions afforded by an environment influence perception.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBy using electroencephalography and virtual reality, our research provide a unique perspective to the centurial open-ended debate in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy on the relation between cognition, movement and environment. Our results indicate that cortical potentials vary as a function of bodily affordances reflected by the physical environment. Firstly, the results of this study implies that cognition is inherently related to potential movement of the body, thus we advance that action is interrelated with perception, actively influencing the perceivable environment. Secondly, as cortical potentials are influenced by the potential to move, which in turn is the task of architectural design, architects holds largely a privilege of human health, and thus potentially capable of provoking and preventing physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Conscious perception is crucial for adaptive behaviour yet access to consciousness varies for different types of objects. The visual system comprises regions with widely distributed category information and exemplar-level representations that cluster according to category. Does this categorical organisation in the brain provide insight into object-specific access to consciousness? We address this question using the Attentional Blink (AB) approach with visual objects as targets. We find large differences across categories in the AB then employ activation patterns extracted from a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to reveal that these differences depend on mid- to high-level, rather than low-level, visual features. We further show that these visual features can be used to explain variance in performance across trials. Taken together, our results suggest that the specific organisation of the higher-tier visual system underlies important functions relevant for conscious perception of differing natural images.",

Fungi use soluble degradation products of plant cell wall components to understand the substrate composition they grow on. Individual signaling pathways have been well described. However, the interconnections between pathways remain poorly understood. In the present work, we provide evidence of \\\"confusion\\\" due to cross-talk between the perception pathways for cellulose and the hemicellulose mannan in several filamentous fungi, leading to the inhibition of cellulase expression. We used the functional genomics tools available for Neurospora crassa to investigate this signaling overlap at the molecular level. Cross-talk and competitive inhibition could be identified both during uptake by cellodextrin transporters and intracellularly. Importantly, the overlap is independent of CRE-1-mediated catabolite repression. These results provide novel insights into the regulatory networks of lignocellulolytic fungi and will contribute to the rational optimization of fungal enzyme production for efficient plant biomass depolymerization and utilization.",

We describe here INSPEcT-, a computational method based on mathematical modeling of intronic and exonic expression, able to derive the dynamics of transcription from steady state or time course profiling of just total RNA, without requiring any information on nascent transcripts. Our approach closely recapitulates the kinetic rates obtained through RNA metabolic labeling, improves the ability to detect changes in transcripts half-lives, reduces the cost and complexity of the experiments, and can be adopted to study experimental conditions where nascent transcription cannot be readily profiled. Finally, we applied INSPEcT- to the characterization of post-transcriptional regulation landscapes in dozens of physiological and disease conditions. This approach was included in the INSPEcT Bioconductor package, which can now unveil RNA dynamics from steady state or time course data, with or without the profiling of nascent RNA.",

    "abstract": "Despite the essential requirement of telomeric DNA for genome stability, the length of telomere tracts between species differs by up to four orders of magnitude, raising the question of the minimal length of telomeric DNA necessary for proper function. Here we address this question using a hypomorphic allele of the telomerase catalytic subunit, TERT. We show that although this construct partially restored telomerase activity to a tert mutant, telomeres continued to shorten over several generations, ultimately stabilizing at a bimodal size distribution. Telomeres on two chromosome arms were maintained at a length of 1kb, while the remaining telomeres were maintained at 400 bp. The longest telomeres identified in this background were also significantly longer in wild type populations, suggesting cis-acting elements on these arms either promote telomerase processivity or recruitment. Genetically disrupting telomerase processivity in this background resulted in immediate lethality. Thus, telomeres of 400 bp are both necessary and sufficient for Arabidopsis viability. As this length is the estimated minimal length for t-loop formation, our data suggest that telomeres long enough to form a t-loop constitute the minimal functional length.",

The striatum is massively degenerated in late stage HD, making examination of post-mortem brain tissue from symptomatic individuals problematic. Striatal tissue is largely intact in the brains of asymptomatic HD positive (HD+) gene carriers, but these samples are exceedingly rare. In this study, caudate nucleus (CAU) tissue from two asymptomatic HD+ individuals was subjected to high throughput mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq) for comparison with similar datasets from symptomatic HD individuals and healthy controls. The overall transcriptional response in HD+ CAU shares much of the same response observed in HD Brodmann Area 9 (BA9) samples, an area that is relatively spared from significant degeneration. A set of differentially expressed (DE) genes predominantly related to the heat shock response are found in common between brain regions, and show much higher induction in HD+ CAU than HD BA9. The most highly perturbed pathways show near complete agreement when comparing diseased tissue with control, and a random forest classifier predicted that the two HD+ CAU samples strongly resemble HD BA9 and not control BA9. Nonetheless, when genes were prioritized by their specificity to HD+ CAU, a large number of pathways spanning many biological processes emerged. Further comparison of HD+ BA9 with HD BA9 identified genes that may be early responders to disease, and have altered expression in symptomatic individuals. This study presents the first and largest examination of asymptomatic brain gene expression to date, and suggests many new avenues of investigation into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in HD.",

    "abstract": "Summary sentenceBoth FSH and LH increase Ca2+ in the granulosa cells of intact ovarian follicles from mice expressing genetically encoded sensors.\\n\\nABSTRACTIn mammalian ovarian follicles, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) signal primarily through the G-protein Gs to elevate cAMP, but both of these hormones can also elevate Ca2+ under some conditions. Here we investigate FSH- and LH-induced Ca2+ signaling in intact follicles of mice expressing genetically encoded Ca2+ sensors, Twitch-2B and GCaMP6s. At a physiological concentration (1 nM), FSH elevates Ca2+ within the granulosa cells of preantral and antral follicles. The Ca2+ rise begins several minutes after FSH application, peaks at ~10 minutes, remains above baseline for another ~10 minutes, and depends on extracellular Ca2+. However, suppression of the FSH-induced Ca2+ increase by reducing extracellular Ca2+ does not inhibit FSH-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinase, estradiol production, or the acquisition of LH responsiveness. Like FSH, LH also increases Ca2+, when applied to preovulatory follicles. At a physiological concentration (10 nM), LH elicits Ca2+ oscillations in a subset of cells in the outer mural granulosa layer. These oscillations continue for at least 6 hours and depend on the activity of Gq family G-proteins. Suppression of the oscillations by Gq inhibition does not inhibit meiotic resumption, but does slightly attenuate ovulation. In summary, both FSH and LH increase Ca2+ in the granulosa cells of intact follicles, but the functions of these Ca2+ rises are only starting to be identified.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule-severing enzyme katanin regulates the organization and turnover of microtubule arrays by the localized breakdown of microtubule polymers. In land plants, katanin (KTN1) activity is essential for the formation of linearly organized cortical microtubule arrays which determine the axis of cell expansion. Cell biological studies have shown that even though KTN1 binds to the sidewalls of single and bundled microtubules, severing activity is restricted to microtubule crossover and nucleation sites, indicating that cells contain protective mechanisms to prevent indiscriminate microtubule severing. Here, we show that the microtubule bundling protein MAP65-1 inhibits KTN1-mediated microtubule severing in vitro. Severing is inhibited at bundled microtubule segments and the severing rate of non-bundled microtubules is reduced by MAP65-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Using various MAP65-1 mutant proteins, we demonstrate that efficient crosslinking of microtubules is crucial for this protective effect and that microtubule binding alone is not sufficient. Reduced severing due to microtubule bundling by MAP65-1 correlated to decreased binding of KTN1 to these microtubules. Taken together, our work reveals that crosslinking of microtubules by MAP65-1 confers resistance to severing by inhibiting the binding of katanin and identifies the structural features of MAP65-1 that are important for this activity.\\n\\nHighlight SummaryCortical microtubule bundles resist severing in vivo.

Using pancreatic beta cells and quantitative proteomics in this study, we identified a Redox Thiol Switch from S-glutathionylation to S-sulfhydration and we named it, RTSGS. About half of the identified proteins are involved in energy metabolism, and one novel target was the mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) whose catalytic Cys306was targeted by both modifications. The enzymatic activity of PCK2 was inhibited by S-glutathionylation, and this inhibition was largely reversed by S-sulfhydration. S-sulfhydration also reversed the S-glutathionylation-mediated inhibition of glucose flux, indicating a broad metabolic significance. We propose that a Redox Thiol Switch from S-glutathionylation to S-sulfhydration is a key mechanism to fine tune cellular energy metabolism in response to different levels of oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells display a network of projections (cytonemes) which mediate cell to cell communication. Under pathological conditions like glioblastoma (GB), cytonemes transform into ultra-long tumour microtubes (TMs). These filopodia infiltrate through the brain, enwrap neurons and deplete wingless (Wg)/WNT, as a consequence GB progress and neurons undergo synapse loss and degeneration. Thus TMs emerge as a central cellular feature of GB which correlates with a poor prognosis in patients and animal models. Here we describe in a Drosophila model for GB the molecular mechanisms behind TMs production, infiltration and maintenance. Glial cells are initially transformed into malignant GB upon EGFR and PI3K pathways constitutive activation, afterwards GB cells establish a positive feedback loop including Wg signalling, JNK and matrix metalloproteases (MMP). In order, Frizzled1 mediates Wg signalling upregulation which activates JNK in GB. As a consequence, MMPs are upregulated and facilitate TMs infiltration in the brain, hence GB TMs network expands and mediate further wingless depletion to close the loop.",

    "abstract": "Semaphorins, specifically type IV, are important regulators of axonal guidance and have been increasingly implicated in poor prognoses in a number of different solid cancers. In conjunction with their cognate PLXNB family receptors, type IV members have been increasingly shown to mediate oncogenic functions necessary for tumor development and malignant spread. In this study, we investigated the role of semaphorin 4C (SEMA4C) in osteosarcoma growth, progression, and metastasis. We investigated the expression and localization of SEMA4C in primary osteosarcoma patient tissues and its tumorigenic functions in these malignancies. We demonstrate that overexpression of SEMA4C promotes properties of cellular transformation, while RNAi knockdown of SEMA4C promotes adhesion and reduces cellular proliferation, colony formation, migration, wound healing, tumor growth, and lung metastasis. These phenotypic changes were accompanied by reductions in activated AKT signaling, G1 cell cycle delay, and decreases in expression of mesenchymal marker genes SNAI1, SNAI2, and TWIST1. Lastly, monoclonal antibody blockade of SEMA4C in vitro mirrored that of the genetic studies. Together, our results indicate a multi-dimensional oncogenic role for SEMA4C in metastatic osteosarcoma and more importantly that SEMA4C has actionable clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a progeroid disease characterized by the early onset of some classically age-related phenotypes including arthritis, loss of body fat and hair and atherosclerosis. Cells from affected individuals express a mutant version of the nuclear envelope protein Lamin A (termed Progerin) and have previously been shown to exhibit prominent chromatin changes. Here, we identify epigenetic deregulation of lamina-associated domains (LADs) as a central feature in the molecular pathology of HGPS. Using ATAC-see/-seq and Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip-mediated DNA methylation profiling, we demonstrate that dermal fibroblasts from HGPS patients exhibit both chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation changes that are enriched in LADs. Importantly, we further show that these epigenetic alterations are associated with HGPS-specific gene expression changes. Together, our results establish a central involvement of LADs in the epigenetic deregulation of HGPS and provide novel insight into the molecular changes associated with the disease.",
