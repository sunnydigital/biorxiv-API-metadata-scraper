    "abstract": "Estimating the polygenicity (proportion of causally associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) and discoverability (effect size variance) of causal SNPs for human traits is currently of considerable interest. SNP-heritability is proportional to the product of these quantities. We present a basic model, using detailed linkage disequilibrium structure from an extensive reference panel, to estimate these quantities from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. We apply the model to diverse phenotypes and validate the implementation with simulations. We find model polygenicities ranging from [~=] 2 x 10-5 to [~=] 4 x 10-3, with discoverabilities similarly ranging over two orders of magnitude. A power analysis allows us to estimate the proportions of phenotypic variance explained additively by causal SNPs reaching genome-wide significance at current sample sizes, and map out sample sizes required to explain larger portions of additive SNP heritability. The model also allows for estimating residual inflation (or deflation from over-correcting of z-scores), and assessing compatibility of replication and discovery GWAS summary statistics.\n\nAuthor SummaryThere are ~10 million common variants in the genome of humans with European ancestry. For any particular phenotype a number of these variants will have some causal effect. It is of great interest to be able to quantify the number of these causal variants and the strength of their effect on the phenotype.\n\nGenome wide association studies (GWAS) produce very noisy summary statistics for the association between subsets of common variants and phenotypes. For any phenotype, these statistics collectively are difficult to interpret, but buried within them is the true landscape of causal effects. In this work, we posit a probability distribution for the causal effects, and assess its validity using simulations. Using a detailed reference panel of ~11 million common variants - among which only a small fraction are likely to be causal, but allowing for non-causal variants to show an association with the phenotype due to correlation with causal variants - we implement an exact procedure for estimating the number of causal variants and their mean strength of association with the phenotype. We find that, across different phenotypes, both these quantities - whose product allows for lower bound estimates of heritability - vary by orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Efficient quantification of the sophisticated shading patterns inside the 3D vegetation canopies may improve our understanding of canopy functions and status, which is possible now more than ever, thanks to the high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms. In order to evaluate the option of quantitative characterization of shading patterns, a simple image mining technique named \"green-gradient based canopy segmentation model (GSM)\" was developed based on the relative variations in the level of RGB triplets under different illuminations. For this purpose, an archive of ground-based nadir images of heterogeneous wheat canopies (cultivar mixtures) was analyzed. The images were taken from experimental plots of a two-year field experiment conducted during 2014-15 and 2015-16 growing seasons in the semi-arid region of southern Iran. In GSM, the vegetation pixels were categorized into the maximum possible number of 255 groups based on their green levels. Subsequently, mean red and mean blue levels of each group were calculated and plotted against the green levels. It is evidenced that the yielded graph could be readily used for (i) identifying and characterizing canopies even as simple as one or two equation(s); (ii) classification of canopy pixels in accordance with the degree of exposure to sunlight; and (iii) accurately prediction of various quantitative properties of canopy including canopy coverage (CC), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), canopy temperature, and also precise classification of experimental plots based on the qualitative characteristics such as subjecting to water and cold stresses, date of imaging, and time of irrigation. It seems that the introduced model may provide a multipurpose HTP platform and open new windows to canopy studies.",

    "abstract": "Searching for a specific visual object requires our brain to compare the items in view with a remembered representation of the sought target to determine whether a target match is present. This comparison is thought to be implemented, in part, via the combination of top-down modulations reflecting target identity with feed-forward visual representations. However, it remains unclear whether top-down signals are integrated at a single locus within the ventral visual pathway (e.g. V4) or at multiple stages (e.g. both V4 and inferotemporal cortex, IT). To investigate, we recorded neural responses in V4 and IT as rhesus monkeys performed a task that required them to identify when a target object appeared across variation in position, size and background context. We found non-visual, task-specific signals in both V4 and IT. To evaluate whether V4 was the only locus for the integration of top-down signals, we evaluated several feed-forward accounts of processing from V4 to IT, including a model in which IT preferentially sampled from the best V4 units and a model that allowed for nonlinear IT computation. IT task-specific modulation was not accounted for by any of these feed-forward descriptions, suggesting that during object search, top-down signals are integrated directly within IT.\\n\\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYTo find specific objects, the brain must integrate top-down, target-specific signals with visual information about objects in view. However, the exact route of this integration in the ventral visual pathway is unclear. In the first study to systematically compare V4 and IT during an invariant object search task, we demonstrate that top-down signals found in IT cannot be described as being inherited from V4, but rather must be integrated directly within IT itself.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of the conservation status of wide ranging species depends on estimates of the magnitude of their population trends. The accuracy of trend estimates will depend on where and how many locations within a species range are sampled. We ask how the spatial extent of sampling interacts with non-linear patterns in long-term trends to affect estimates of decline in standardised catch of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) on the east coast of Australia. We apply a Bayesian trend model that uses prior information on life-history traits to estimate trends where we use data from all regions versus spatial subsets of the data. As more regions were included in the model the trend estimates converged towards an overall decline of 71% over three generations. Trends estimated from data only from northern regions or southern regions underestimated and overestimated the regional decline, respectively. When a subset of regions was modelled, rather than the full data-set, the prior informed by life-history traits performed well, as did a weakly informed prior that allowed for high variation. The rate of decline in tiger sharks is consistent with a listing East Coast Australia tiger sharks as endangered under local legislation. Monitoring programs that aim to estimate population trends should attempt to cover the extremes and mid-points of a populations range. Life-history information can be used to inform priors for population variation and may give more accurate estimates of trends that can be justified in debates about the status of threatened species, particularly when sampling is limited.",

    "abstract": "To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define molecular alterations within (and between) disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell states. We note that disease-associated perturbations usually retain cellular-identity programs (core genes), providing an appropriate reference for secondary comparison analyses. Thus, we created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis and classification of cell types from diverse scRNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony is an automated and easy-to-use tool that efficiently matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community clustering and alignment strategy. Utilizing core genes and community clustering to reveal disease and cell-state systems-level insights overcomes bias toward donor and disease effects that can be imposed by joint-alignment approaches. Moreover, cellHarmony directly compares cell frequencies and gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner, then produces a holistic representation of these differences across potentially dozens of cell populations and impacted regulatory networks. Using this approach, we identify gene regulatory programs that are selectively impacted in distinct hematopoietic and heart cell populations that suggest novel disease mechanisms and drug targets. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex diseases.",

Here, we ask whether the putative role of the hippocampal-entorhinal system in transforming relative and absolute spatial coordinates during navigation extends to transformations in abstract decision spaces. During fMRI scanning, subjects learned a strangers preference for an everyday activity - relative to one of three personally known individuals - and subsequently decided how the strangers preference relates to the other two individuals preferences. We found that entorhinal cortex/subiculum signals exhibited reference frame-sensitive responses to the absolute distance between the ratings of the stranger and the familiar choice options. In contrast, striatal signals increased when accurately determining the ordinal position of choice options in relation to the stranger. Paralleling its role in navigation, these data implicate the entorhinal/subicular region in assimilating relatively coded knowledge within abstract metric spaces.",

    "abstract": "The complex genetic architecture of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and its heterogeneous phenotype make molecular diagnosis and patient prognosis challenging tasks. To establish more precise genotype-phenotype correlations in ASD, we developed a novel machine learning integrative approach, which seeks to delineate associations between patients clinical profiles and disrupted biological processes inferred from their Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that span brain genes. Clustering analysis of relevant clinical measures from 2446 ASD cases in the Autism Genome Project identified two distinct phenotypic subgroups. Patients in these clusters differed significantly in ADOS-defined severity, adaptive behaviour profiles, intellectual ability and verbal status, the latter contributing the most for cluster stability and cohesion. Functional enrichment analysis of brain genes disrupted by CNVs in these ASD cases identified 15 statistically significant biological processes, including cell adhesion, neural development, cognition and polyubiquitination, in line with previous ASD findings. A Naive Bayes classifier, generated to predict the ASD phenotypic clusters from disrupted biological processes, achieved predictions with a high Precision (0.82) but low recall (0.39), for a subset of patients with higher biological Information Content scores. This study shows that milder and more severe clinical presentations can have distinct underlying biological mechanisms. It further highlights how machine learning approaches can reduce clinical heterogeneity using multidimensional clinical measures, and establish genotype-phenotype correlations in ASD. However, predictions are strongly dependent on patients information content. Findings are therefore a first step towards the translation of genetic information into clinically useful applications, but emphasize the need for larger datasets with very complete clinical and biological information.",

    "abstract": "Whether new pancreatic beta-cells arise via pre-existing beta-cells or from differentiation of precursor cells - a question of fundamental importance for diabetic therapy - has long been debated. Recent experiments suggest that multipotent precursors from adult mouse pancreas, that give rise to beta-cells, do exist. However, such a finding is at odds with prior evidence that beta-cell expansions occurs exclusively through self-replication. Here we show that these two observations can be partially compatible. We use a systems biology approach to analyze the dynamics of the endogenous molecular-cellular network in the pancreas. Our results show that self-replicating  beta-cells can themselves be multipotent precursors. In addition, our model predicts heterogeneity in beta-cell regeneration and suggests various differentiation paths of precursors. This work therefore provides a means of reconciling an apparent contradiction in the field, but also sheds light on possible paths of beta-cell regeneration from a systems biology perspective.",

DGKZ-shRNA lentiviral vector was established and used to infect acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine the viability of HL-60 cells DGKZ knocked down. Apoptosis and cell cycle phase of HL-60 cells after DGKZ knockdown were evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to investigated the protein expression related to apoptosis and cell cycle. Results showed DGKZ expression were stable and higher in Jurkat, HL-60, THP-1,K562 leukemia cells than those of H9 and CD34 cells. Compared with cells of the shCtrl group, DGKZ was markedly knocked down in cells which were transfected with lentivirus encoding shRNA of DGKZ in HL-60 cells. DGKZ knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in HL-60 cells. Western blot results indicated the expressions of caspase-3, caspase-8, and survivin markedly increased in HL-60 cells after knockdown of DGKZ. The results suggest Knockdown of DGKZ can inhibit proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase through caspases pathway.",

    "abstract": "MotivationA key issue in the omics literature is the search for statistically significant relationships between molecular markers and phenotype. The aim is to detect disease-related discriminatory features while controlling for false positive associations at adequate power. Metabolome-wide association studies have revealed significant relationships of metabolic phenotypes with disease risk by analysing hundreds to tens of thousands of molecular variables leading to multivariate data which are highly noisy and collinear. In this context, conventional Bonferroni or Sidak multiple testing corrections are rather useful as these are valid for independent tests, while permutation procedures allow for the estimation of significance levels from the null distribution without assuming independence among features. Nevertheless, under the permutation approach the distribution of p-values may present systematic deviations from the theoretical null distribution which leads to overly conservative adjusted threshold estimates i.e. smaller than a Bonferroni or Sidak correction.\\n\\nMethodsWe make use of parametric approximation methods based on a multivariate Normal distribution to derive stable estimates of the metabolome-wide significance level. A univariate approach is applied based on a permutation procedure which effectively controls the overall type I error rate at the  level.\\n\\nResultsWe illustrate the approach for different model parametrizations and distributional features of the outcome measure, using both simulated and real data.

    "abstract": "Monocular deprivation (MD) during the juvenile critical period leads to long-lasting impairments in binocular function and visual acuity. The site of these changes has been widely considered to be cortical. However, recent evidence indicates that binocular integration may first occur in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN), raising the question of whether MD during the critical period may produce long-lasting deficits in dLGN binocular integration. Using in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of dLGN afferents and excitatory neurons in superficial layers of primary visual cortex (V1), we demonstrate that critical-period MD leads to a persistent and selective loss of binocular dLGN inputs, while leaving spatial acuity in the thalamocortical pathway intact. Despite being few in number, binocular dLGN boutons display remarkably robust visual responses, on average twice stronger than monocular boutons, and their responses are exquisitely well-matched between the eyes. To our surprise, we found that MD leads to a profound binocular mismatch of response amplitude, spatial frequency and orientation tuning detected at the level of single thalamocortical synapses. In comparison, V1 neurons display deficits in both binocular integration and spatial acuity following MD. Our data provide the most compelling evidence to date demonstrating that following critical-period MD, binocular deficits observed at the level of V1 may at least in part originate from dLGN binocular dysfunction, while spatial acuity deficits arise from cortical circuits. These findings highlight a hitherto unknown role of the thalamus as a site for developmental refinement of binocular vision.",

However, empirical support for the relationship has relied on small-sample studies with mixed evidence. We investigate the reliability and generalizability of the relationship in two large-scale double-blind placebo-controlled experiments in young men (N=243 and N=400), using two different testosterone administration protocols.

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoid hormones are important intermediates between an organism and its environment. They enable an organism to adjust its behavioural and physiological processes in response to environmental changes by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) expressed in many tissues, including the integument. The regulation of glucocorticoids covaries with melanin-based colouration in numerous species, an association that might result from the melanocortin system and evolve within a signalling context. Most studies have focused on the circulating levels of glucocorticoids disregarding the receptors that mediate their action and could partly account for the covariation between the regulation of stress and melanin-based coloration. We investigated the association between melanin-based coloration and the gene expression levels of GR and MR but also of the melanocortin system and melanogenesis in the growing feathers of nestling barn owls (Tyto alba). We also considered the expression of genes related to the melanocortin system and melanogenesis to better understand the origin of the link between the expression of receptors to which corticosterone binds and melanin-based coloration. Nestling barn owls displaying larger black feather spots expressed GR and MR at lower levels than did smaller-spotted individuals. Because the expression of the GR and MR genes was positively, rather than negatively, correlated with the expression of melanogenic genes, we suggest that the link between melanin-based coloration, GR and MR is not directly associated to melanogenesis. The finding that the expression of GR and MR was positively associated with the expression of the PCSK2 gene (encoding the protein convertase responsible for post-translational modification of the proopiomelanocortin hormone) suggests that the melanocortin system may be implicated in the establishment of the covariation between melanism and the expression of receptors to which glucocorticoids bind. Together with previous studies, our results suggest that coloration is not only related to the production of glucocorticoids but also to the sensitivity of the integument to glucocorticoids.",

    "abstract": "Researchers in the life sciences are posting their work to preprint servers at an unprecedented and increasing rate, sharing papers online before (or instead of) publication in peer-reviewed journals. Though the popularity and practical benefits of preprints are driving policy changes at journals and funding organizations, there is little bibliometric data available to measure trends in their usage. Here, we collected and analyzed data on all 37,648 preprints that were uploaded to bioRxiv.org, the largest biology-focused preprint server, in its first five years. We find that preprints on bioRxiv are being read more than ever before (1.1 million downloads in October 2018 alone) and that the rate of preprints being posted has increased to a recent high of more than 2,100 per month. We also find that two-thirds of bioRxiv preprints posted in 2016 or earlier were later published in peer-reviewed journals, and that the majority of published preprints appeared in a journal less than six months after being posted. We evaluate which journals have published the most preprints, and find that preprints with more downloads are likely to be published in journals with a higher impact factor. Lastly, we developed Rxivist.org, a website for downloading and interacting programmatically with indexed metadata on bioRxiv preprints.",

    "abstract": "Plant-insect interactions are ubiquitous, and have been studied intensely because of their relevance to damage and pollination in agricultural plants, and to the ecology and evolution of biodiversity. Variation within species can affect the outcome of these interactions, such as whether an insect successfully develops on a plant species. Whereas specific genes and chemicals that mediate these interactions have been identified, studies of genome-or metabolome-wide intraspecific variation might be necessary to better explain patterns of host-plant use and adaptation often observed in the wild. Here, we present such a study. Specifically, we assess the consequences of genome-wide genetic variation in the model plant Medicago truncatula for Lycaeides melissa caterpillar growth and survival (i.e., larval performance). Using a rearing experiment and a whole-genome SNP data set (>5 million SNPs), we show that polygenic variation in M. truncatula explains 9-41% of the observed variation in caterpillar growth and survival. We detect genetic correlations among caterpillar performance and other plant traits, such as structural defenses and some anonymous chemical features; these genetic correlations demonstrate that multiple M. truncatula alleles have pleiotropic effects on plant traits and caterpillar growth or survival (or that there is substantial linkage disequilibrium among loci affecting these traits). We further show that a moderate proportion of the genetic effect of M. truncatula alleles on L. melissa performance can be explained by the effect of these alleles on the plant traits we measured, especially leaf toughness. Taken together, our results show that intraspecific genetic variation in M. truncatula has a substantial effect on the successful development of L. melissa caterpillars (i.e., on a plant-insect interaction), and further point toward traits mediating this genetic effect.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis centers are a recently-developed form of scientific organization that catalyzes and supports a form of interdisciplinary research that integrates diverse theories, methods and data across spatial or temporal scales, scientific phenomena, and forms of expertise to increase the generality, parsimony, applicability, or empirical soundness of scientific explanations. Research has shown the synthesis working group to be a distinctive form of scientific collaboration that reliably produces consequential, high-impact publications, but no one has asked: do synthesis working groups produce publications that are substantially more diverse than those produced outside of synthesis centers, and if so, how and with what effects? We have investigated these questions through a novel textual analysis. We found that if diversity is measured solely by mean difference in the Rao-Stirling (aggregate) measure of diversity, then the answer is no. But synthesis center papers have significantly greater variety and balance, but significantly lower disparity, than papers in the reference corpus. Synthesis center influence is mediated by the greater size of synthesis center collaborations (numbers of authors, distinct institutions, and references) but even when taking size into account, there is a persistent direct effect: synthesis center papers have significantly greater variety and balance, but less disparity, than papers in the reference corpus. We conclude by inviting further exploration of what this novel textual analysis approach might reveal about interdisciplinary research and by offering some practical implications of our results.",

Local leadership in research capacity strengthening is important for developing contextually appropriate programs that increase locally-driven research, and improve Africas ability to adapt and use scientific knowledge. This study provides an overview of African organisations that aim to strengthen research capacity in Africa, and the major initiatives or approaches being used for this purpose.\\n\\nMethodsA desk review of grey and published literature on research capacity strengthening in Africa was conducted, in addition to panel discussions on the determinants of research capacity in Africa. Data was analysed through thematic analysis and a framework developed by the Collaboration for Research Excellence in Africa (CORE Africa).\\n\\nResults11 organisations were identified, spread across South, Central, East and West Africa. The main approaches to improving research capacity were: providing opportunities for academic research and research training. Initiatives to provide research equipment, funding and facilitate research use for policy-making were limited; while strategies to increase research awareness, promote collaboration, and provide guidance and incentives for research were lacking. Most organisations had programs for researchers and academics, with none targeting funders or the general public.\\n\\nConclusionLocal leadership is essential for improving research capacity in Africa. In addition to providing adequate support to academics and researchers, initiatives that help revitalize the education system in Africa, promote collaboration and engage funders and the general public will be helpful for strengthening research capacity in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Birds produce diverse acoustic signals, with coexisting species occupying distinct  acoustic niches to minimize masking, resulting in overdispersion within acoustic space. In tropical regions of the world, an influx of migrants from temperate regions occurs during winter. The effects of these migrants on acoustic community structure and dynamics remain unstudied. Here, I show that in a tropical urban bird community, the influx of winter migrants is accompanied by a turnover of the acoustic community. However, in spite of this turnover, the acoustic community remains overdispersed in acoustic niche space. The winter acoustic community additionally exhibits lower frequency-band diversity, consistent with species singing less continuously, as well as lower phylogenetic diversity. My data thus suggests that acoustic niches and community structure are stable across seasons in spite of species turnover. Migrants occupy similar regions of acoustic space as residents, and are relatively closely related to some of these species. Their arrival therefore leads to greater phylogenetic clustering in the winter, and thus lower phylogenetic diversity, although the acoustic community remains overdispersed. Studying seasonal dynamics of acoustic communities thus provides valuable insight into assembly processes, as well as a potential framework for long-term monitoring of urban ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp.) is a major crop for worldwide food and nutritional security, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, that is resilient to hot and drought-prone environments. A high-quality assembly of the single-haplotype inbred genome of cowpea IT97K-499-35 was developed by exploiting the synergies between single molecule real-time sequencing, optical and genetic mapping, and a novel assembly reconciliation algorithm. A total of 519 Mb is included in the assembled sequences. Nearly half of the assembled sequence is composed of repetitive elements, which are enriched within recombination-poor pericentromeric regions. A comparative analysis of these elements suggests that genome size differences between Vigna species are mainly attributable to changes in the amount of Gypsy retrotransposons. Conversely, genes are more abundant in more distal, high-recombination regions of the chromosomes; there appears to be more duplication of genes within the NBS-LRR and the SAUR-like auxin superfamilies compared to other warm-season legumes that have been sequenced. A surprising outcome of this study is the identification of a chromosomal inversion of 4.2 Mb among landraces and cultivars, which includes a gene that has been associated in other plants with interactions with the parasitic weed Striga gesnerioides. The genome sequence also facilitated the identification of a putative syntelog for multiple organ gigantism in legumes. A new numbering system has been adopted for cowpea chromosomes based on synteny with common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris).",

    "abstract": "The boundaries of the visual areas located anterior to V2 in the dorsomedial region of the macaque cortex remain contentious. This region is usually conceptualized as including two functional subdivisions: the dorsal component of area V3 (V3d), laterally, and another area, named the parietooccipital area (PO) or V6, medially. However, the nature of the putative border between V3d and PO/V6 has remained undefined. We recorded the receptive fields of multiunit clusters in adult male macaques, and reconstructed the locations of recording sites using histological sections and \\\"unfolded\\\" cortical maps. Immediately adjacent to dorsomedial V2 we observed a representation of the lower contralateral quadrant, which represented the vertical meridian at its rostral border. This region, corresponding to V3d of previous studies, formed a simple eccentricity gradient, from approximately <5{degrees} in the annectant gyrus, to >60{degrees} in the parietooccipital sulcus. However, there was no topographic reversal where one would expect to find the border between V3d and PO/V6. Rather, near the midline, this lower quadrant map continued directly into a representation of the peripheral upper visual field, without an intervening lower quadrant representation that could be unambiguously assigned to PO/V6. Thus, V3d and PO/V6 form a continuous topographic map, which includes parts of both quadrants. Together with previous observations that V3d and PO/V6 are both densely myelinated relative to adjacent cortex, and share similar input from V1, these results suggest that they are parts of a single area, which is distinct from the one forming the ventral component of the third tier complex.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe primate visual cortex has a large number of areas. Knowing the extent of each visual area, and how they can be distinguished from each other, are essential for the interpretation of experiments aimed at understanding visual processing. Currently, there are conflicting models of the organization of the dorsomedial visual cortex rostral to area V2 (one of the earliest stages of cortical processing of vision). By conducting large-scale electrophysiological recordings, we found that what were originally thought to be distinct areas in this region (dorsal V3, and the parietooccipital area [PO/V6]), together form a single map the visual field. These results will help guide future functional studies, and the interpretation of the outcomes of lesions involving the dorsal visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays L.) is an important food and feed crop in Bangladesh as well as in the world. But its cultivation is limited in the soils of Sylhet, Bangladesh. To study the physiological growth indices of maize genotypes an experiment was carried out at the experimental field of Sylhet Agricultural University (SAU), Bangladesh during December 2014 to May 2015. The maize genotypes as the experimental materials were ZM 0001, ZM 0002, ZM 0003, ZM 0004, ZM 0005, ZM 0006 ZM 0007 and BARI Maize 6. The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. Seeds were sown on 26 December 2014. Proper cultural management practices were followed as and when necessary during the growing period of the crop. Data were recorded on dry matter partitioning, different growth rate parameters and dry matter production of different plant parts at 30 days interval. The results indicated significant variations in almost all of the growth indices. Dry matter accumulation continued to increase from seedling to harvesting. The highest root dry matter was found in ZM 0007 (36.03 g) whereas the highest shoot and leaf dry matter was found in BARI Maize 6 (254.6 and 45.99 g, respectively) at harvest. The highest total dry matter (TDM) was produced in BARI Maize 6 at harvest (287.5 g) and AGR and CGR value was also highest in BARI Maize 6 (5.686 g day-1 and 45.48 g m-2 day-1) but at 60-90 days after germination (DAG). The highest RGR value was in ZM 0001 at seedling stage (114.1 mg g-1 day-1). A zigzag pattern graph was observed in all genotypes for RSR, RWR and SWR at different growth stages but a declining trend from seedling to harvesting was observed for LWR. Correlation between the growth rate parameters and kernel yield showed that shoot, leaf, total dry weight, AGR, CGR, RGR and SWR had significant positive correlation with yield.",

Enforced expression of GFI1B in K562 erythroleukemia cells favors erythroid over megakaryocytic differentiation, providing a platform to define molecular determinants of binary fate decisions triggered by GFI1B. We deployed proteome-wide proximity labeling to identify factors whose inclusion in GFI1B complexes depends upon GFI1Bs obligate effector, Lysine Specific Demethylase (LSD)1. We show that GFI1B preferentially recruits core and putative elements of the BRAF-histone deacetylase (HDAC) (BHC) chromatin remodeling complex (LSD1, RCOR1, HMG20A, HMG20B, HDAC1, HDAC2, PHF21A, GSE1, ZMYM2 and ZNF217) in an LSD1-dependent manner to control erythroid fate specification. Among these, depletion of both HMG20A and HMG20B, or GSE1 block GFI1B-mediated erythroid differentiation, phenocopying impaired differentiation brought on by LSD1 depletion or disruption of GFI1B--LSD1 binding. These findings demonstrate the central role of the GFI1B--LSD1 interaction as a determinant of BHC complex recruitment to enable cell fate decisions driven by GFI1B.",

Feedforward sensory information dominates the motor behavior during the open-loop pursuit, and a more complex feedback loop regulates the steady-state pursuit. To understand the neural representations of motion direction during open-loop and steady-state smooth pursuits, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) responses from human observers while they tracked random dot kinematograms as pursuit targets. We estimated population direction tuning curves from multivariate EEG activity using an inverted encoding model. We found significant direction tuning curves as early as 20 ms from motion onset. Direction tuning responses were generalized to later times during the open-loop smooth pursuit, but they became more dynamic during the later steady-state pursuit. The encoding quality of retinal motion direction information estimated from the early direction tuning curves was predictive of trial-by-trial variation in initial pursuit directions. These results suggest that the movement directions of open-loop smooth pursuit are guided by the representation of the retinal motion present in the multivariate EEG activity.",

As inflammation has been shown to precede the clinical diagnosis of RA and it is a known moderator of neuro- and gliogenesis, we were interested in testing whether these brain morphological changes appear before the clinical onset of disease in healthy young adult volunteers, as a function of relative genetic risk for RA. Genetic and structural MRI data were available for 516 healthy non-Hispanic Caucasian university students (275 women, mean age 19.78{+/-}1.24 years). Polygenic risk scores were computed for each individual based on a genome-wide association study of RA, so that higher scores indicated higher risk. Striatal volume (sum of caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens volumes) and ICV were derived for each individual from high-resolution T1-weighted images. After controlling for sex, age, genetic components of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and depressive symptoms, we found that higher RA polygenic risk scores were associated with increased striatal volume, but not decreased ICV. Our findings suggest that increased striatal volume may be linked to processes that precede disease onset, such as inflammation, while decreased ICV may relate to disease progression.",

Here we show by tandem native protein complex purification approach and super-resolution STED microscopy that insulin receptor activity requires association with the fundamental structural module in muscle, the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), and the desmosomal component plakoglobin ({gamma}-catenin). The integrity of this high-molecular-mass assembly renders skeletal muscle susceptibility to insulin because DGC-insulin receptor dissociation by plakoglobin downregulation reduced insulin signaling and caused atrophy. Furthermore, impaired insulin receptor function in muscles from diabetic mice reduced plakoglobin-DGC-insulin receptor content on the plasma membrane; however, plakoglobin overexpression alone restored DGC association with the insulin receptor, and stimulated glucose uptake. Our findings establish DGC as a signaling hub, containing plakoglobin as an auxiliary subunit, and provide a possible mechanism for the insulin resistance in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and for the cardiomyopathies seen with plakoglobin mutations.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWith high-throughput genotyping systems now available, it has become feasible to fully integration genotyping information into breeding programs [22]. To make use of this information effectively requires DNA extraction facilities and marker production facilities that can efficiently deploy the desired set of markers across samples with a rapid turnaround time that allows for selection before crosses needed to be made. In reality, breeders often have a short window of time to make decisions by the time they are able collect all their phenotyping data and receive corresponding genotyping data. This presents a challenge to organize information and utilize them in downstream analyses to support decisions made by breeders. In order to implement genomic selection routinely as part of breeding programs one would need an efficient genotype data storage system. We selected and benchmarked six popular open-source data storage systems, including relational database management and columnar storage systems.\\n\\nResultsWe found that data extract times are greatly influenced by the orientation in which genotype data is stored in a system. HDF5 consistently performed best, in part because it can more efficiently work with both orientations of the allele matrix.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://gobiinx1.bti.cornell.edu:6083/projects/GBM/repos/benchmarking/browse\\n\\nContactyn259@cornell.edu",

    "abstract": "The microRNA Let-7 controls the expression of proteins that belong to two distinct gene regulatory networks, namely a cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) network driving the cell cycle and a cell transformation network which can undergo an epigenetic switch between a non-transformed and a malignant transformed cell state.\\n\\nUsing mathematical modeling and transcriptomic data analysis, we here investigate how Let-7 controls the cdk-dependent cell cycle network, and how it couples the latter with the transformation network. We also determine whether the two networks can be combined into a larger entity that impacts on cancer progression.\\n\\nOur analysis shows that the switch from a quiescent to a cycling state depends on the relative levels of Let-7 and several cell cycle activators. Numerical simulations further indicate that the Let-7-coupled cell cycle and transformation networks control each other, and our model identifies key players for this mutual control. Transcriptomic data analysis from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) suggest that the two networks are activated in cancer, in particular in gastrointestinal cancers, and that the activation levels vary significantly among patients affected with a same cancer type. Our mathematical model, when applied to a heterogeneous cell population, suggests that heterogeneity among tumors results from stochastic switches between a non-transformed cell state with low proliferative capability and a transformed cell state with high proliferative property. The model further predicts that Let-7 may reduce tumor heterogeneity by decreasing the occurrence of stochastic switches towards a transformed, proliferative cell state.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we identified the key components responsible for the qualitative dynamics of two GRNs interconnected by Let-7. The two GRNs are heterogeneously involved in several cancers, thereby stressing the need to consider patients specific GRN characteristics to optimize therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The early detection of cancer is essential for effective intervention. Urine, which lacks homeostatic control, has been used to reflect early systemic changes in subcutaneous cancer models. However, urine has not been used to predict whether tumors will be formed in animal models. In this study, a cancer model was established by the tail-vein injection of 2 million NuTu-19 tumor cells. Approximately half of the rats formed lung metastatic carcinoma tumors. Urine samples were randomly selected from 4 tumor-forming rats and 4 non-tumor-forming rats on day 0/12/27/39/52 and analyzed by label-free proteomic quantitative analysis. Compared to day 0, a total of 180 and 118 urinary proteins in tumor-forming and non-tumor-forming rats, respectively, showed significant changes. Functional enrichment analysis of the differential proteins in tumor-forming rats revealed similar events during cancer metastasis cascades and tumor progression, such as the migration of tumor cell lines, coagulation system, TGF-{beta} signaling, the STAT3 pathway and the adhesion of myeloid cells and alveolar macrophages. The differential proteins in non-tumor-forming rats were associated with agranulocyte/granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, glutathione biosynthesis, IL-12 signaling and vitamin metabolism. After validation by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) targeted proteomics quantitative analysis, a total of 22 urinary proteins showed significant changes in the early phase of the lung tumor formation process, 5 of which have been associated with the mechanisms of lung cancer, while 3 have been suggested as lung cancer biomarkers. Another 14 urinary proteins showed significant changes in the early phase in non-tumor-forming rats. Our results indicate that urine proteins could differentiate early tumor-forming and non-tumor-forming status.",

    "abstract": "Biotic invasions threaten global biodiversity and ecosystem function, and present challenges to agriculture where invasive pest species require major economic investment in control and can cause significant production losses. Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) is key to prioritizing agricultural biosecurity efforts, but is hampered by incomplete knowledge of current crop pest and pathogen distributions. Here we develop predictive models of current pest distributions and test these models using new observations at sub-national resolution. We apply generalized linear models (GLM) to estimate presence probabilities for 1901 crop pests in the CABI pest distribution database. We test model predictions for 100 unobserved pests in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), against observations of these pests abstracted from the Chinese literature which has hitherto been omitted from databases on global pest distributions. Finally, we predict occurrences of all unobserved pests globally. Presence probability increases with host presence, presence in neighbouring regions, and global prevalence, and decreases with mean distance from coast, per capita GDP, and host number. The models are good predictors of pest presence in Provinces of the PRC, with AUC values of 0.76 - 0.80. Large numbers of currently unobserved, but probably present pests, are predicted in China, India, southern Brazil and some countries of the former USSR. GLMs can predict presences of pseudo-absent pests at sub-national resolution. Controlling for countries scientific capacity improves model fit. The Chinese scientific literature has been largely inaccessible to Western academia but contains important information that can support PRA. Prior studies have often assumed that unreported pests in a global distribution database is a true absence. Our analysis provides a method for quantifying pseudo-absences to enable improved PRA and species distribution modelling.",

This approach results in substantial advantages in quality, dimensionality, and training speed compared to MaxEnt models based solely on the standard 20-letter amino-acid alphabet.

    "abstract": "Molecular interaction networks are our basis for understanding functional interdependencies among genes. Network embedding approaches analyze these complicated networks by representing genes as low-dimensional vectors based on the network topology. These low-dimensional vectors have recently become the building blocks for a larger number of systems biology applications. Despite the success of embedding genes in this way, it remains unclear how to effectively represent gene sets, such as protein complexes and signaling pathways. The direct adaptation of existing gene embedding approaches to gene sets cannot model the diverse functions of genes in a set. Here, we propose GRep, a novel gene set embedding approach, which represents each gene set as a multivariate Gaussian distribution rather than a single point in the low-dimensional space. The diversity of genes in a set, or the uncertainty of their contribution to a particular function, is modeled by the covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. By doing so, GRep produces a highly informative and compact gene set representation. Using our representation, we analyze two major pharmacogenomics studies and observe substantial improvement in drug target identification from expression-derived gene sets. Overall, the GRep framework provides a novel representation of gene sets that can be used as input features to off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers for gene set analysis.",

    "abstract": "In allosteric proteins, the binding of a ligand modifies function at a distant active site. Such al-losteric pathways can be used as target for drug design, generating considerable interest in inferring them from sequence alignment data. Currently, different methods lead to conflicting results, in particular on the existence of long-range evolutionary couplings between distant amino-acids mediating allostery. Here we propose a resolution of this conundrum, by studying epistasis and its inference in models where an allosteric material is evolved in silico to perform a mechanical task. We find four types of epistasis (Synergistic, Sign, Antagonistic, Saturation), which can be both short or long-range and have a simple mechanical interpretation. We perform a Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) and find that DCA predicts well mutation costs but is a rather poor generative model. Strikingly, it can predict short-range epistasis but fails to capture long-range epistasis, in agreement with empirical findings. We propose that such failure is generic when function requires subparts to work in concert. We illustrate this idea with a simple model, which suggests that other methods may be better suited to capture long-range effects.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAllostery in proteins is the property of highly specific responses to ligand binding at a distant site. To inform protocols of de novo drug design, it is fundamental to understand the impact of mutations on allosteric regulation and whether it can be predicted from evolutionary correlations. In this work we consider allosteric architectures artificially evolved to optimize the cooperativity of binding at allosteric and active site. We first characterize the emergent pattern of epistasis as well as the underlying mechanical phenomena, finding four types of epistasis (Synergistic, Sign, Antagonistic, Saturation), which can be both short or long-range. The numerical evolution of these allosteric architectures allows us to benchmark Direct Coupling Analysis, a method which relies on co-evolution in sequence data to infer direct evolutionary couplings, in connection to allostery. We show that Direct Coupling Analysis predicts quantitatively mutation costs but underestimates strong long-range epistasis. We provide an argument, based on a simplified model, illustrating the reasons for this discrepancy and we propose neural networks as more promising tool to measure epistasis.",

We developed a protocol based on single-molecule, circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to generate highly-accurate (99.8%) long reads averaging 13.5 kb and applied it to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385. We optimized existing tools to comprehensively detect variants, achieving precision and recall above 99.91% for SNVs, 95.98% for indels, and 95.99% for structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the high-quality Genome in a Bottle benchmark. Nearly all (99.64%) variants are phased into haplotypes, which further improves variant detection. De novo assembly produces a highly contiguous and accurate genome with contig N50 above 15 Mb and concordance of 99.998%.

Participants performed a memory task on a target auditory stream presented at 4 Hz while ignoring a distractor auditory stream also presented at 4 Hz, but with a 180-degree shift in phase.

However, the functions of annexins in diverse biological processes in rice are largely unclear. Herein, we report that OsANN4, a calcium-binding rice annexin protein, is a substrate for OsCDPK24, and the OsANN4 phosphorylation site is the 13th serine, which is a key site for phosphorylation. Most strikingly, abscisic acid (ABA) promotes the interaction between OsANN4 and OsCDPK24. Moreover, knocking down OsANN4 by RNA interference resulted in visible and invisible phenotypes with exogenous ABA treatment, such as shorter shoots of seedlings, less lateral roots, earlier root aerenchyma formation and so on. The further analyzed results showed that decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity of the RNAi lines, which control H2O2 accumulation for redox homeostasis, and further promoted earlier aerenchyma formation of the root. These results suggest that a proposed molecular mechanism exists between OsANN4 and H2O2 production to response ABA.\\n\\nHighlightOsANN4 enhances SOD and CAT activities to scavenge H2O2 to alleviate the formation of aerenchyma under ABA treatment.

In natural environment, however, microbial population and evolution are greatly influenced by the property and composition of natural organic C. In this study, 8 types of organic C sources were fed to intrinsic groundwater microbes collected at Oak Ridge Reservation Field Research Center (ORR-FRC) background site for a 30-day incubation period to investigate the response of indigenous bacterial communities to different C sources. The tested C sources included simple organic C (glucose, acetate, benzoate, oleic acid, and cellulose) that are either traditionally used as C source in bacterial culture medium or present in natural environments; naturally occurring undefined complex C (bacterial cell lysate and sediment-derived natural organic matter (NOM)); as well as vitamin mixture which is a commonly used ingredient in culture medium. Our results clearly indicate that natural complex C substrates served better in enriching diverse bacteria compared to other C sources. Microcosms amended with small organic C (glucose, acetate, benzoate, or oleic acid) showed significantly lower biodiversity than control groups, dominated by only a few phyla of bacteria such as Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes which are commonly isolated and already have diverse representative isolates, while those amended with natural complex C (cell lysate or NOM) displayed significantly higher biodiversity than control groups, in which three phyla (Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and Armatimonadetes) that are poorly represented in published culture collections were abundantly enriched. Further isolation of pure bacterial strains from complex C-amended enrichments led to 51 species representing 4 phyla, 13 orders. Furthermore, 5 isolates with low similarities to published strains were considered to be novel. Results from this study will aid in the design of better cultivation and isolation strategy for maximize the diversity of organisms recovered from subsurface environment.",

    "abstract": "Rapid diagnostic tests are needed to improve patient care, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Here, we describe the validation of a new phenotypic culture-based FAST-T method for rapid selection of antibiotics in vitro using specimens with mono-and polybacterial infections. FAST-T approach, which can be applied to any type of non-blood tissue, does not require isolation of pure bacterial cultures. FAST-T-selected antibiotics are those that can completely eliminate mixed bacterial infections in specimens. The method uses a novel FASM-T medium that allows more rapid bacterial growth of gram-positive and gram-negative monoisolates compared with that achieved with conventional laboratory media. The application of the FAST-T method in 122 bacterial species demonstrated overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 99.6%, 98.1%, 98.5%, and 99.4%, respectively, already after 4 h. The overall category agreement with the outcome of standard testing was 98.9% with very major errors and major errors being detected in 1.2% and 0.6% of cases.\\n\\nThe use of FASM-T medium in 20 clinical polymicrobial samples allowed culturing a more diverse set of bacteria, including fastidious species, compared with that achieved with the standard laboratory diagnostic and enabled, already within 4 h, accurate selection of the antibiotics that completely eliminated all cultivatable bacteria from clinical samples. In conclusion, FAST-T system may be a valuable tool in improving phenotypic-based antibiotic selection, enabling targeted empirical therapy and accurate antibiotic replacement, which is especially important in high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Overactive DNA repair contributes to therapeutic resistance in cancer. However, pan-cancer comparative studies investigating the contribution of all DNA repair genes in cancer progression employing an integrated approach have remained limited. We performed a multicohort retrospective analysis to determine the prognostic significance of 138 DNA repair genes in 16 cancer types (n=16,225). Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed a significant variation in the number of prognostic genes between cancers; 81 genes were prognostic in clear cell renal cell carcinoma while only two genes were prognostic in glioblastoma. We reasoned that genes that were commonly prognostic in highly correlated cancers revealed by Spearmans correlation analysis could be harnessed as a molecular signature for risk assessment. A 10-gene signature, uniting prognostic genes that were common in highly correlated cancers, was significantly associated with overall survival in patients with clear cell renal cell (P<0.0001), papillary renal cell (P=0.0007), liver (P=0.002), lung (P=0.028), pancreas (P=0.00013) or endometrial (P=0.00063) cancers. Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that a combined model of the 10-gene signature and tumor staging outperformed either classifiers when considered alone. Multivariate Cox regression models incorporating additional clinicopathological features revealed that the signature was an independent predictor of overall survival. Tumor hypoxia is associated with adverse outcomes. Consistent across all six cancers, patients with high 10-gene and high hypoxia scores had significantly higher mortality rates compared to those with low 10-gene and low hypoxia scores. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that high mortality rates in patients with high 10-gene scores were attributable to an overproliferation phenotype. Death risk in these patients was further exacerbated by concurrent mutations of a cell cycle checkpoint protein, TP53. The 10-gene signature identified tumors with heightened DNA repair ability. This information has the potential to radically change prognosis through the use of adjuvant DNA repair inhibitors with chemotherapeutic drugs.",

Prior cross-sectional studies have investigated the combined effects of age and genetics on gene expression and alternative splicing; however, there has been no long-term, longitudinal characterization of these molecular changes, especially in older age. We performed RNA sequencing in whole-blood from the same individuals from the PIVUS study at ages 70 and 80 to quantify how gene expression, alternative splicing, and their genetic regulation are altered during this 10-year period of advanced aging. We observe that individuals are more similar to their own expression profiles later in life than profiles of other individuals their own age; 93% of samples cluster with their own measurement at another age, and there is a strong correlation of genetic effects on expression between the two ages (median{rho} G = 0.96). Despite this, we identify 1,291 and 294 genes differentially expressed and alternatively spliced with age, as well as 529 genes with outlying individual trajectories of aging. Further, 7.8% and 9.6% of tested genes show a reduction in genetic associations with expression and alternative splicing in older age, with impacted genes enriched in DNA repair pathways. Together these findings indicate that, although gene expression and alternative splicing and their genetic regulation are mostly stable late in life, a small subset of genes is dynamic and is characterized by changes in expression and splicing and a reduction in genetic regulation.",

We tested the hypothesis that environmental adipogens highly ranked by the taxonomy, but segregated from therapeutic PPAR{gamma} ligands, would induce white but not brite adipogenesis.\n\nMethods3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in the presence of 76 chemicals (negative controls, nuclear receptor ligands known to influence adipocyte biology, potential environmental PPAR{gamma} ligands). Differentiation was assessed by measuring lipid accumulation. mRNA expression was determined by RNA-Seq and validated by RT-qPCR. A novel classification model was developed using an amended random forest procedure. A subset of environmental contaminants identified as strong PPAR{gamma} agonists were analyzed by their effects on lipid handling, mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular respiration in 3T3-L1 cells and human preadipocytes.\n\nResultsWe used lipid accumulation and RNA sequencing data to develop a classification system that 1) identified PPAR{gamma} agonists, and 2) sorted chemicals into likely white or brite adipogens. Expression of Cidec was the most efficacious indicator of strong PPAR{gamma} activation. Two known environmental PPAR{gamma} ligands, tetrabromobisphenol A and triphenyl phosphate, which sorted distinctly from therapeutic ligands, induced white adipocyte genes but failed to induce Pgc1a and Ucp1, and induced fatty acid uptake but not mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, two chemicals identified as highly ranked PPAR{gamma} agonists, tonalide and quinoxyfen, induced white adipogenesis without the concomitant health-promoting characteristics of brite adipocytes in mouse and human preadipocytes.\n\nDiscussionA novel classification procedure accurately identified environmental chemicals as PPAR{gamma} ligands distinct from known PPAR{gamma}-activating therapeutics.

Artemisinins have anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, anthelmintic, antiviral, antioxidant, and other properties. Our preliminary reverse virtual screening demonstrated that the ligand-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor (LBD of hGR) is the optimal target for artemisinin. At the same time, the binding sites for artemisinin with the ligand-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor coincide with those of dexamethasone. However, the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exact molecular targets and mechanisms of action of artemisinin are not well known. In this work, the interaction of artemisinin with human serum albumin (HSA) was studied both in vitro and in silico. The results indicate that artemisinin leads to a decrease in optical absorption and quenching of fluorescence by a static mechanism, which is similar to the effect of dexamethasone. Artemisinin interacts with Drug site I on HSA and forms a hydrogen bond with arginine 218. Retardation of the genomic DNA of sarcoma S-180 cells show that artemisinin does not interact directly with DNA.

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) is the driving force behind precision medicine and is revolutionizing most, if not all, areas of the life sciences. Particularly when targeting the major common diseases, an exponential growth of NGS data is foreseen for the next decades. This enormous increase of NGS data and the need to process the data quickly for real-world applications requires to rethink our current compute infrastructures. Here we provide evidence that memory-driven computing (MDC), a novel memory-centric hardware architecture, is an attractive alternative to current processor-centric compute infrastructures. To illustrate how MDC can change NGS data handling, we used RNA-seq assembly and pseudoalignment followed by quantification as two first examples. Adapting transcriptome assembly pipelines for MDC reduced compute time by 5.9-fold for the first step (SAMtools). Even more impressive, pseudoalignment by near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification (kallisto) was accelerated by more than two orders of magnitude with identical accuracy and indicated 66% reduced energy consumption. One billion RNA-seq reads were processed in just 92 seconds. Clearly, MDC simultaneously reduces data processing time and energy consumption. Together with the MDC-inherent solutions for local data privacy, a new compute model can be projected pushing large scale NGS data processing and primary data analytics closer to the edge by directly combining high-end sequencers with local MDC, thereby also reducing movement of large raw data to central cloud storage. We further envision that other data-rich areas will similarly benefit from this new memory-centric compute architecture.",

While elucidation of cell state heterogeneity and its role in biology and pathobiology has been advanced by studying single cell level measurements, the underlying assumptions of current analytical methods limit the identification and exploration of cell clades. Unlike other methods, which produce a single uni-layer partition of cells ignoring echelons of cell states, we present TooManyCells, a software consisting of a suite of graph-based tools for efficient, global, and unbiased identification and visualization of cell clades while maintaining and presenting the relationship between cell states. TooManyCells provides a set of tools based on a matrix-free efficient divisive hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm wholly different from the prevalent Louvain-based methods. BirchBeer, the visualization component of TooManyCells, introduces a new approach for single cell analysis that is built on a concept intentionally orthogonal to the widely used dimensionality reduction methods. Together, this suite of tools provide a paradigm shift in the analysis and interpretation of single cell data by enabling simultaneous comparisons of cell states at context-and application-dependent scales. A byproduct of this shift is the immediate detection and visualization of rare populations that outperforms previous algorithms as demonstrated by applying these tools to existing single cell RNA-seq data sets from various mouse organs.",

Farmed Nile tilapia populations are increasingly based on genetically improved stocks, which have been established from admixed populations. To date, there is scarce information about the population genomics of farmed Nile tilapia, assessed by dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels. The patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) may affect the success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection and can also provide key information about demographic history of farmed Nile tilapia populations. The objectives of this study were to provide further knowledge about the population structure and LD patterns, as well as, estimate the effective population size (Ne) for three farmed Nile tilapia populations, one from Brazil (POP A) and two from Costa Rica (POP B and POP C). A total of 55, 56 and 57 individuals from POP A, POP B and POP C, respectively, were genotyped using a 50K SNP panel selected from a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) experiment. Two principal components explained about 20% of the total variation and clearly discriminated between the three populations. Population genetic structure analysis showed evidence of admixture, especially for POP C. The contemporary Ne values calculated based to LD values, ranged from 71 to 141. No differences were observed in the LD decay among populations, with a rapid decrease of r2 when increasing inter-marker distance. Average r2 between adjacent SNP pairs ranged from 0.03 to 0.18, 0.03 to 0.17 and 0.03 to 0.16 for POP A, POP B and POP C, respectively. Based on the number of independent chromosome segments in the Nile tilapia genome, at least 4.2 K SNP are required for the implementation of GWAS and genomic selection in farmed Nile tilapia populations.",

    "abstract": "The role of visual pattern adaptation, and learning, in spatial integration was investigated. Observers performed a perpetual grouping task in which they reported whether a grid of identical tilted bars (45{degrees} counterclockwise from the vertical) is perceived as rows or columns. Performance was measured multiple times during a testing session to determine the effects of repeated exposure to the stimuli. To test for possible effects of learning on the within-session dynamics, observers repeated the experiment on five different days. We found that repeated performance produced rapid within-day improvements, which were largely transient, and were not retained when tested on subsequent days. In addition, exposure to stimuli with equal orientation contributed to the within-session improvement, whereas stimuli having an orientation differing by 45{degrees} from the orientation used in the grouping task diminished the improvement previously obtained in the same session. Practice with the task, over days, resulted in faster improvements. The transient nature of these exposure-driven improvements and their susceptibility to interference by stimuli designed to reduce adaptation suggests that adaptation was the main cause for the observed improvements. Finally, to investigate the effects of adaptation on internal noise and on spatial integration, we employed an external noise paradigm, showing that internal noise reduction resulted from adaptation. Internal noise was reduced only when spatial integration was effective, suggesting that adaptation improved perception of global stimulus properties. Overall, our results suggest that the grouping task benefits from an adaptation process that rapidly adjusts the visual system to the statistics of the visual stimuli. We suggest that this effect is achieved through spatial decorrelation of neural responses. With practice, the visual system is able to adjust faster to changes in the statistics of the environment.",

Nevertheless, many crops continue to display some atavistic characteristics that were advantageous to their wild ancestors, such as pod dehiscence (PD). Domesticated common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), a nutritional staple for millions of people globally, shows considerable variation in PD. Here, we identified multiple genetic regions controlling PD in common bean grown throughout geographically distributed lineages. For example, on chromosome Pv03, PvPdh1 shows a single base-pair substitution that is strongly associated with decreased PD and expansion of the crop into northern Mexico, where the arid conditions promote PD. The environmental dependency and genetic redundancy explain the maintenance of atavistic traits under domestication. Knowledge of PD genetics will assist in developing aridity-adapted varieties.\\n\\nAbstractA reduction in pod dehiscence (PD) is an important part of the domestication syndrome in legumes, including common bean. Despite this, many modern dry bean varieties continue to suffer yield reductions due to dehiscence, an atavistic trait, which is particularly problematic in hot, dry environments. To date, the genetic control of this important trait has been only partially resolved. Using QTL mapping and GWAS, we identified major PD QTLs in dry beans on chromosomes Pv03, Pv05, Pv08, and Pv09, three of which had not been described previously. We further determined that the QTL on chromosome Pv03, which is strongly associated with PD in Middle American beans, includes a dirigent-like candidate gene orthologous to Pod dehiscence 1 (Pdh1) of soybean. In this gene, we identified a substitution in a highly conserved amino acid that is unique to PD-resistant varieties. This allele is associated with the expansion of Middle American domesticated common beans into the arid environments of northern Mexico, resulting in a high allelic frequency in the domesticated ecogeographic race Durango. The polygenic redundancy and environmental dependency of PD resistance may explain the maintenance of this atavistic characteristic after domestication. Use of these alleles in breeding will reduce yield losses in arid growing conditions, which are predicted to become more widespread in coming decades.",

    "abstract": "Recombination between divergent DNA sequences is actively prevented by heteroduplex rejection mechanisms. In bakers yeast such anti-recombination mechanisms can be initiated by the recognition of DNA mismatches in heteroduplex DNA by MSH proteins, followed by recruitment of the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 helicase-topoisomerase complex to unwind the recombination intermediate. We previously showed that the repair/rejection decision during single-strand annealing recombination is temporally regulated by MSH protein levels and by factors that excise non-homologous single-stranded tails. These observations, coupled with recent studies indicating that mismatch repair factors interact with components of the histone chaperone machinery, encouraged us to explore roles for epigenetic factors and chromatin conformation in regulating the decision to reject vs. repair recombination between divergent DNA substrates. This work involved the use of an inverted repeat recombination assay thought to measure sister chromatid repair during DNA replication. Our observations are consistent with the histone chaperones CAF-1 and Rtt106 and the histone deacetylase Sir2 acting to suppress heteroduplex rejection and the Rpd3, Hst3 and Hst4 deacetylases acting to promote heteroduplex rejection. These observations and double mutant analysis have led to a model in which nucleosomes located at DNA lesions stabilize recombination intermediates and compete with mismatch repair factors that mediate heteroduplex rejection.\\n\\nSummaryRecombination between divergent DNA sequences is actively prevented by heteroduplex rejection mechanisms.

    "abstract": "During replication, RNA virus populations accumulate genome alterations, such as mutations and deletions. The interactions between individual variants within the population can determine the fitness of the virus and, thus, the outcome of infection. We developed an ordinary differential equation model to infer the effect of the interaction between defective interfering (DI) replicons and wild-type (WT) poliovirus. We measure production of RNA and viral particles during a single infection cycle, and use these data to infer model parameters. We find that DI replicates faster than WT, but an equilibrium is established when both WT and DI compete for resources needed for RNA replication and genome encapsidation. In the presence of DI, the concentration of WT virions at cell lysis is suppressed by the factor of 5. Multiple generations within a single cell infection provide opportunities for significant inhibition of WT replication by competition with the faster replicating DI genomes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDRetinoblastoma (RB), the commonest early childhood intraocular tumor, is most often related to mutations in the RB1 gene with an incidence of 3% of all pediatric tumors. It has good prognosis if diagnosed early but it is life-threatening when diagnosed late.\\n\\nOBJECTIVETo study the Molecular Genetic Analysis of Retinoblastoma (RB) in Sudanese families.\\n\\nMETHODSThirty one (n=31) clinically and histopathologically diagnosed cases of RB attending Makkah Eye Complex (MEC) Orbit clinic (Khartoum, Sudan) were included in this Molecular Genetic RB Analysis. Fresh blood samples extracted from seven RB patients and 15 close families for DNA extraction and PCR were sent for Genetic Sequencing and In silico approach for \\\"Exon 18 mutations\\\" which is one of the highly mutated exons worldwide.\\n\\nRESULTSThe majority of patients (41.9%) were below five years old. Females were 58.1%, males were 41.9%. Leukocoria was the commonest sign at presentation (41.9%). RB Unilaterality were in (77.4%) while Bilaterality in 19.4%. Both eyes were equally affected 50% each. The age at diagnosis time ranged from 0.02 to five years. Consanguinity of parents was very high (85.7%), the 1st degree cousins were less (28.6%) while the 2nd degree was high (57.1%). The patients ethnic background and geographical area were from seven different tribes; all belong to the Western Sudan. The molecular genetic study showed that exon 18 was free of mutation among the seven patients + their three relatives. The Functional Analysis and (SNPs) prediction study of exon 18 from NCBI data base showed that the various computational approaches used (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, I-mutant and Project hope) identified 16 reported mutations worldwide, three of which (rs137853292, rs375645171 and rs772068738) are major nsSNPs (non-synonymous) which might contribute to native RB1 protein malfunction and ultimately causing carcinoma.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONRB mainly affected children under five years and both sexes are equally affected. Unilaterality was predominant. Consanguinity plays a role in inheritance and the majority of patients were from Western Sudan. The most commonly detected deleterious mutations worldwide in exon 18 were not found in the Sudanese studies samples. Further screening for the highly reported mutations in exons 8, 10 and 14 or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) are recommended. In silico tools are useful in studying the functional analysis of SNPs.",

Although researchers argue that object shape is crucial in these cases, there are open questions as to how shape is represented for object recognition. Here we tested whether the human visual system incorporates a three-dimensional skeletal descriptor of shape to determine an objects identity. Skeletal models not only provide a compact description of an objects global shape structure, but also provide a quantitative metric by which to compare the visual similarity between shapes. Our results showed that a model of skeletal similarity explained the greatest amount of variance in participants object dissimilarity judgments when compared with other computational models of visual similarity (Experiment 1). Moreover, parametric changes to an objects skeleton led to proportional changes in perceived similarity, even when controlling for another model of structure (Experiment 2). Importantly, participants preferentially categorized objects by their skeletons across changes to local shape contours and non-accidental properties (Experiment 3). Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal structure in vision, not only as a shape descriptor, but also as a diagnostic cue of object identity.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana, canonical auxin-dependent gene regulation is mediated by 23 transcription factors from the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) family, most of which interact with 29 auxin/indole acetic acid (Aux/IAA) repressors, themselves forming, in the presence of auxin, coreceptor complexes with one of six TRANSPORT INHIBITOR1/AUXIN-SIGNALLING F-BOX PROTEINS (TIR1/AFB). Different combinations of co-receptors drive specific sensing outputs, allowing auxin to control a myriad of processes. Considerable efforts have been made to discern the temporal and spatial specificity of auxin action. However, owing to a lack of obvious phenotype in single loss-of-function mutants in Aux/IAA genes, most genetic studies have relied on gain-of-function mutants, which are highly pleiotropic. In this article, we describe a molecular framework for the role of several members of the auxin sensing machinery. Using loss-of-function mutants, we demonstrate that TIR1 and AFB2 are positive regulators, whereas IAA6, IAA9 and IAA17 are negative regulators of adventitious root (AR) formation. The three Aux/IAA proteins interact with ARF6 and/or ARF8, which we have previously shown to be positive regulators of AR formation upstream of jasmonate, and likely repress their activity. Our data also suggest a dual role for TIR1 in the control of JA biosynthesis and conjugation, as revealed by upregulation of several JA biosynthesis genes in the tir1-1 mutant. In conclusion, we propose that in the presence of auxin, TIR1 and AFB2 form specific sensing complexes with IAA6, IAA9 and/or IAA17 that modulate JA homeostasis to control AR initiation.\\n\\nSignificanceAdventitious root (AR) formation is a quantitative trait with high phenotypic plasticity and auxin plays a major role in its control. In previous studies, we have shown that, in Arabidopsis hypocotyls, AR formation is negatively regulated by jasmonate, whose homeostasis is controlled by a regulatory module composed of three AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARF), two of which are positive regulators of three auxin inducible Gretchen Hagen3 (GH3) genes. The present work demonstrates that the two F-box proteins, i.e., TIR1 and AFB2, together with at least three Aux/IAA proteins are likely to interact in a combinatorial manner to control the activity of the two activator ARFs upstream of JA biosynthesis and/or homeostasis, thereby controlling AR initiation in Arabidopsis hypocotyls.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory sensitivity is influenced by intranasal trigeminal sensation. For instance, sniffing is central to how humans and animals perceive odorants. Here, we investigated the influence of olfactory co-stimulation on the perception of intranasal somatosensory stimulation. In this study, twenty-two healthy human subjects, with normal olfactory function, performed a localization task for weak air-puff stimuli, in the presence or absence of a pure odorant, phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA; rose odor). Visual cues were used to inform participants to briefly hold their breath while weak, poorly localizable, air-puffs and/or PEA were delivered to either nostril. Although PEA alone could not be localized, when accompanied by a weak air-puff in the ipsilateral nostril, localization accuracy significantly improved, relative to presentation of the air-puff without the odorant. The enhancement of localization was absent when the air-puff and PEA were presented to opposite nostril. Since ipsilateral but not contralateral co-stimulation with PEA increased the accuracy of weak air-puff localization, the results argue against a non-specific alerting effect of PEA. These findings suggest an interaction between the olfactory and somatosensory trigeminal systems.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how individuals utilize social information while making perceptual decisions and how it affects their decision confidence is crucial in a society. Till date, very little is known about perceptual decision making in humans under the influence of social cues and the associated neural mediators. The present study provides empirical evidence of how individuals get manipulated by social cues while performing a face/car identification task. Subjects were significantly influenced by what they perceived as decisions of other subjects while the cues in reality were manipulated independently from the stimulus. Subjects in general tend to increase their decision confidence when their individual decision and social cues coincide, while their confidence decreases when cues conflict with their individual judgments often leading to reversal of decision. Using a novel statistical model, it was possible to rank subjects based on their propensity to be influenced by social cues. This was subsequently corroborated by analysis of their neural data. Neural time series analysis revealed no significant difference in decision making using social cues in the early stages unlike neural expectation studies with predictive cues. Multivariate pattern analysis of neural data alludes to a potential role of frontal cortex in the later stages of visual processing which appeared to code the effect of social cues on perceptual decision making. Specifically medial frontal cortex seems to play a role in facilitating perceptual decision preceded by conflicting cues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThird-generation single molecule sequencing technologies can sequence long reads, which is advancing the frontiers of genomics research. However, their high error rates prohibit accurate and efficient downstream analysis. This difficulty has motivated the development of many long read error correction tools, which tackle this problem through sampling redundancy and/or leveraging accurate short reads of the same biological samples. Existing studies to asses these tools use simulated data sets, and are not sufficiently comprehensive in the range of software covered or diversity of evaluation measures used.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we present a categorization and review of long read error correction methods, and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the corresponding long read error correction tools. Leveraging recent real sequencing data, we establish benchmark data sets and set up evaluation criteria for a comparative assessment which includes quality of error correction as well as run-time and memory usage. We study how trimming and long read sequencing depth affect error correction in terms of length distribution and genome coverage post-correction, and the impact of error correction performance on an important application of long reads, genome assembly. We provide guidelines for practitioners for choosing among the available error correction tools and identify directions for future research.\\n\\nConclusionsDespite the high error rate of long reads, the state-of-the-art correction tools can achieve high correction quality. When short reads are available, the best hybrid methods outperform non-hybrid methods in terms of correction quality and computing resource usage. When choosing tools for use, practitioners are suggested to be careful with a few correction tools that discard reads, and check the effect of error correction tools on downstream analysis.

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells pose significant obstacles to curative treatment contributing to tumor relapse and poor prognosis. They share many signaling pathways with normal stem cells that control cell proliferation, self-renewal and cell fate determination. One of these pathways known as Wnt is frequently implicated in carcinogenesis where Wnt hyperactivation is seen in cancer stem cells. Yet, the role of conserved genomic alterations in Wnt genes driving tumor progression across multiple cancer types remains to be elucidated. In an integrated pan-cancer study involving 21 cancers and 18,484 patients, we identified a core Wnt signature of 16 genes that showed high frequency of somatic amplifications linked to increased transcript expression. The signature successfully predicted overall survival rates in six cancer cohorts (n=3,050): bladder (P=0.011), colon (P=0.013), head and neck (P=0.026), pan-kidney (P<0.0001), clear cell renal cell (P<0.0001) and stomach (P=0.032). Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the performance of the 16-Wnt-gene signature was superior to tumor staging benchmarks in all six cohorts and multivariate Cox regression analyses confirmed that the signature was an independent predictor of overall survival. In bladder and renal cancer, high risk patients as predicted by the Wnt signature had more hypoxic tumors and a combined model uniting tumor hypoxia and Wnt hyperactivation resulted in further increased death risks. Patients with hyperactive Wnt signaling had molecular features associated with stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our study confirmed that genomic amplification underpinning pan-cancer Wnt hyperactivation and transcriptional changes associated with molecular footprints of cancer stem cells lead to increased death risks.\\n\\nList of Abbreviations",

    "abstract": "Formation of the three primary germ layers during gastrulation is an essential step in the establishment of the vertebrate body plan. Recent studies employing single cell RNA-sequencing have identified major transcriptional changes associated with germ layer specification. Global epigenetic reprogramming accompanies these changes, but the role of the epigenome in regulating early cell fate choice remains unresolved, and the coordination between different epigenetic layers is unclear. Here we describe the first single cell triple-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the exit from pluripotency and the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. We find dynamic dependencies between the different molecular layers, with evidence for distinct modes of epigenetic regulation. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of local lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements, driven by loss of methylation in enhancer marks and a concomitant increase of chromatin accessibility. In striking contrast, the epigenetic landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or epigenetically remodelled prior to overt cell fate decisions during gastrulation, providing the molecular logic for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIFirst map of mouse gastrulation using comprehensive single cell triple-omic analysis.\\nC_LIO_LIExit from pluripotency is associated with a global repressive epigenetic landscape, driven by a sharp gain of DNA methylation and a gradual decrease of chromatin accessibility.\\nC_LIO_LIDNA methylation and chromatin accessibility changes in enhancers, but not in promoters, are associated with germ layer formation.\\nC_LIO_LIMesoderm and endoderm enhancers become open and demethylated upon lineage commitment.\\nC_LIO_LIEctoderm enhancers are primed in the early epiblast and protected from the global repressive dynamics, supporting a default model of ectoderm commitment in vivo.\\nC_LI",

We found that inhibition and activation of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons decreases and increases freezing to aversively conditioned cues, respectively. We then show that locally inhibiting or activating LC terminals in CeA is sufficient to achieve this bidirectional modulation of defensive reactions.

The magnitude of this effect depended on the specific fungi present, but individual fungal effects diminished as inoculum richness increased. Above-ground microbes likely influence other plant traits as well and should be considered in any study measuring plant phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs the number of new genome assemblies continues to grow, there is increasing demand for methods to coalesce contigs from draft assemblies into pseudomolecules. Most current methods use genetic maps, optical maps, chromatin conformation (Hi-C), or other long-range linking data, however these data are expensive and analysis methods often fail to accurately order and orient a high percentage of assembly contigs. Other approaches utilize alignments to a reference genome for ordering and orienting, however these tools rely on slow aligners and are not robust to repetitive contigs.\\n\\nResultsWe present RaGOO, an open-source reference-guided contig ordering and orienting tool that leverages the speed and sensitivity of Minimap2 to accurately achieve chromosome-scale assemblies in just minutes. With the pseudomolecules constructed, RaGOO identifies structural variants, including those spanning sequencing gaps that are not reported by alternative methods. We show that RaGOO accurately orders and orients contigs into nearly complete chromosomes based on de novo assemblies of Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing from three wild and domesticated tomato genotypes, including the widely used M82 reference cultivar. We then demonstrate the scalability and utility of RaGOO with a pan-genome analysis of 103 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions by examining the structural variants detected in the newly assembled pseudomolecules. RaGOO is available open-source with an MIT license at https://github.com/malonge/RaGOO.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that with a highly contiguous assembly and a structurally accurate reference genome, reference-guided scaffolding with RaGOO outperforms error-prone reference-free methods and enable rapid pan-genome analysis.",

    "abstract": "Nephrolithiasis is a common urological trait disorder with acute pain. Although previous studies have identified various genetic variations associated with nephrolithiasis, the host genetic factors remain largely unidentified. To identify novel nephrolithiasis loci in the Japanese population, we performed large-scale GWAS (Genome wide association study) using 11,130 cases and 187,639 controls, followed by a replication analysis using 2,289 cases and 3,817 controls. The analysis identified 14 significant loci, including 9 novel loci on 2p23.2-3, 6p21.2, 6p12.3, 6q23.2, 16p12.3, 16q12.2, 17q23.2, 19p13.12, and 20q13.2. Interestingly, 10 of the 14 regions showed a significant association with any of 16 quantitative traits, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits, suggesting a common genetic background among nephrolithiasis patients and these quantitative traits. Four novel loci are related to the metabolic pathway, while the remaining 10 loci are associated with the crystallization pathway. Our findings demonstrate the crucial roles of genetic variations in the development of nephrolithiasis.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNephrolithiasis is a common urothelial disorders with frequent recurrence rate, but its genetic background is largely remained unidentified. Previous GWAS identified 6 genetic factors in total. Here we performed a GWAS using more than 200,000 samples in the Japanese populations, and identified 14 significant loci and nine of them are novel. We also found that 10 of the 14 loci showed a significant association with any of 16 quantitative traits, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits (BMI, eGFR, UA, Ca etc). All 14 significant loci are associate with either metabolic or crystallization pathways. Thus, our findings elucidated the underlying molecular pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis.",

    "abstract": "Seeking new insights into the homeostasis, modulation and plasticity of cortical synaptic networks, we have analyzed results from a single-cell RNA-seq study of 22,439 mouse neocortical neurons. Our analysis exposes transcriptomic evidence for dozens of molecularly distinct neuropeptidergic modulatory networks that directly interconnect all cortical neurons. This evidence begins with a discovery that transcripts of one or more neuropeptide precursor (NPP) and one or more neuropeptide-selective G-protein-coupled receptor (NP-GPCR) genes are highly abundant in all, or very nearly all, cortical neurons. Individual neurons express diverse subsets of NP signaling genes from palettes encoding 18 NPPs and 29 NP-GPCRs. These 47 genes comprise 37 cognate NPP/NP-GPCR pairs, implying the likelihood of local neuropeptide signaling. Here we use neuron-type-specific patterns of NP gene expression to offer specific, testable predictions regarding 37 peptidergic neuromodulatory networks that may play prominent roles in cortical homeostasis and plasticity.\\n\\nImpactSingle-cell mRNA sequencing data from mouse neocortex expose evidence for peptidergic neuromodulatory networks that locally interconnect every cortical neuron\\n\\nData HighlightsO_LIAt least 97% of mouse neocortical neurons express one or more of 18 neuropeptide precursor proteins (NPP) genes at very high levels\\nC_LIO_LIAt least 98% of cortical neurons express one or more of 29 neuropeptide-selective G-protein-coupled receptor (NP-GPCR) genes cognate to the 18 highly expressed NPP genes\\nC_LIO_LINeocortical expression of these 18 NPP and 29 NP-GPCR genes is highly neuron-type-specific and their expression patterns differentiate transcriptomic neuron types with exceptional power\\nC_LIO_LINeuron-type taxonomy and type-specific expression of 37 cognate NPP / NP-GPCR gene pairs generate testable predictions of at least 37 local intracortical neuromodulation networks\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress severely limits agricultural crop production throughout the world, and the stress is increasing particularly in the irrigated agricultural areas. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important grain legume that plays a significant role in the nutrition of the developing world. In this study, we used a chickpea subset collected from the genebank of the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Area (ICARDA). This collection was selected by using the focused identification of germplasm strategy (FIGS). The subset included 138 genotypes which have been screened in the open field (Arish, Sinai, Egypt) and in the greenhouse (Giza, Egypt) by using the hydroponic system at 100 mM NaCl concentration. The experiment was laid out in randomized alpha lattice design in two replications. The molecular characterization was done by using sixteen SSR markers (collected from QTL conferred salinity tolerance in chickpea), 2,500 SNP and 3,031 DArT markers which have been developed and used for association study. The results indicated significant differences between the chickpea genotypes. Based on the average of the two hydroponic and field experiments, seven tolerant genotypes IGs (70782, 70430, 70764, 117703, 6057, 8447 and 70249) have been identified. The data analysis indicated one SSR (TAA170), three DArT (DART2393, DART769 and DART2009) and eleven SNP markers (SNP2021, SNP1268, SNP1451, SNP1487, SNP1667, SNP2095, SNP190, SNP2247 SNP1947, SNP2331 and SNP948) were associated with salinity tolerance. The flanking regions of these markers revealed genes with a known role in the salinity tolerance, which could be candidates for marker-assisted selection in chickpea breeding programs.",
