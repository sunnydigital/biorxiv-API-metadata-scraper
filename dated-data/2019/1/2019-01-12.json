    "abstract": "The extent to which visual inference is shaped by attentional goals is unclear. Voluntary attention may simply modulate the priority with which information is accessed by higher cognitive functions involved in perceptual decision making. Alternatively, voluntary attention may influence fundamental visual processes, such as those involved in segmenting an incoming retinal signal into a structured scene of coherent objects, thereby determining perceptual organisation. Here we tested whether the segmentation and integration of visual form can be determined by an observers goals by exploiting a novel variant of the classical Kanizsa figure. We generated predictions about the influence of attention with a machine classifier, and tested these predictions with a psychophysical response classification technique. Despite seeing the same image on each trial, observers perception of illusory spatial structure depended on their attentional goals. These attention-contingent illusory contours directly conflicted with equally plausible visual form implied by the geometry of the stimulus, revealing that attentional selection can determine the perceived layout of a fragmented scene. Attentional goals, therefore, not only select pre-computed features or regions of space for prioritised processing, but, under certain conditions, also greatly influence perceptual organisation and thus visual appearance.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe extent to which higher cognitive functions can influence perceptual organisation is debated. The role of voluntary spatial attention, the ability to focus on only some parts of a scene, has been particularly controversial among neuroscientists and psychologists who aim to uncover the basic neural computations involved in grouping image features into coherent objects. To address this issue, we repeatedly presented the same novel ambiguous image to observers and changed their attentional goals by having them make fine spatial judgements about only some elements of the image. We found that observers attentional goals determine the perceived organisation of multiple illusory shapes. We thus reveal that voluntary spatial attention can control the fundamental processes that determine perceptual organisation.",

    "abstract": "Genomics offered the promise of transforming antibiotic discovery by revealing many new essential genes as good targets, but the results fell short of the promise. It is becoming clear that a major limitation was that essential genes for a bacterial species were often defined based on a single or limited number of strains grown under a single or limited number of in vitro laboratory conditions. In fact, the essentiality of a gene can depend on both genetic background and growth condition. We thus developed a strategy for more rigorously defining the core essential genome of a bacterial species by studying many pathogen strains and growth conditions. We assessed how many strains must be examined to converge on a set of core essential genes for a species. We used transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) to define essential genes in nine strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on five different media and developed a novel statistical model, FiTnEss, to classify genes as essential versus non-essential across all strain-media combinations. We defined a set of 321 core essential genes, representing 6.6% of the genome. We determined that analysis of 4 strains was typically sufficient in P. aeruginosa to converge on a set of core essential genes likely to be essential across the species across a wide range of conditions relevant to in vivo infection, and thus to represent attractive targets for novel drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Natural conversation is multisensory: when we can see the speakers face, visual speech cues influence our perception of what is being said. The neuronal basis of this phenomenon remains unclear, though there is indication that phase modulation of neuronal oscillations--ongoing excitability fluctuations of neuronal populations in the brain--provides a mechanistic contribution. Investigating this question using naturalistic audiovisual speech with intracranial recordings in humans, we show that neuronal populations in auditory cortex track the temporal dynamics of unisensory visual speech using the phase of their slow oscillations and phase-related modulations in high-frequency activity. Auditory cortex thus builds a representation of the speech streams envelope based on visual speech alone, at least in part by resetting the phase of its ongoing oscillations. Phase reset could amplify the representation of the speech stream and organize the information contained in neuronal activity patterns.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWatching the speaker can facilitate our understanding of what is being said. The mechanisms responsible for this influence of visual cues on the processing of speech remain incompletely understood. We studied those mechanisms by recording the human brains electrical activity through electrodes implanted surgically inside the skull. We found that some regions of cerebral cortex that process auditory speech also respond to visual speech even when it is shown as a silent movie without a soundtrack. This response can occur through a reset of the phase of ongoing oscillations, which helps augment the response of auditory cortex to audiovisual speech. Our results contribute to discover the mechanisms by which the brain merges auditory and visual speech into a unitary perception.",

    "abstract": "As DNA methylation is one of the key epigenetic mechanisms involved in embryonic development, elucidating its relationship with non-coding RNA and genes is essential for understanding early development. In this study, we performed single-base-resolution bisulfite sequencing together with RNA-seq to explore the genetic basis of embryonic muscle development in chicken. Comparison of methylome profiles between broilers and laying hens revealed that lower methylation in broilers might contribute to muscle development. Differential methylated region (DMR) analysis between two chicken lines showed that the majority of DMRs were hypo-DMRs for broilers. Differential methylated genes were significantly enriched in muscle development-related terms at E13 and E19. Furthermore, by constructing the network of the lncRNAs, we identified a lncRNA, which we named MYH1-AS, that potentially regulated muscle development. These findings reveal an integrative landscape of late period of embryonic myogenesis in chicken and give rise to a comprehensive understanding of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, in skeletal muscle development. Our study provides a reliable data resource for further muscle studies.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of subtypes within the Influenza A virus genus has recently expanded with the identification of H17N10 and H18N11 from bats. In order to further study the tropism and zoonotic potential of these viruses, we have successfully produced lentiviral pseudotypes bearing both haemagglutinin H17 and neuraminidase N10. These pseudotypes were shown to be efficiently neutralized by the broadly-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies CR9114 and FI6. Our studies also confirm previous reports that H17 does not use sialic acid as its cellular receptor, as pseudotypes bearing the H17 envelope glycoprotein are released into the cell supernatant in the absence of NA. However, we demonstrate that N10 facilitates heterosubtypic (H5 and H7) influenza HA-bearing pseudotype release in the absence of another source of NA, significantly increasing luciferase pseudotype production titres. Despite this, N10 shows no activity in the enzyme-linked lectin assay used for traditional sialidases. These findings suggest that this protein plays an important role in viral egress, but is perhaps involved in further accessory roles in the bat influenza lifecycle that are yet to be discovered. Thus we show the lentiviral pseudotype system is a useful research tool, and amenable for investigation of bat influenza tropism, restriction and sero-epidemiology, without the constraints or safety issues with producing a replication-competent virus, to which the human population is naive.\\n\\nSignificance statementInfluenza virus is responsible for mortality and morbidity across the globe; human populations are constantly at risk of newly emerging strains from the aquatic bird reservoir which harbors most of the subtypes of influenza A (H1-H16). Recently identified subtypes (H17N10, H18N11) from bats have broadened the reservoir from which potential pandemic strains of influenza can emerge. To evaluate the potential for these novel subtypes to cross over into human populations, their ability to establish an infection, in addition to the extent of cross-reactive immunity established by human seasonal strains needs to be investigated. This study highlights a novel platform for the study of the bat H17 and N10 envelope glycoproteins, using a lentiviral pseudotype system. Following the generation of this pseudotype it was employed in cell entry and microneutralization assays. These showed that two well-characterised monoclonal antibodies (mAb) which target avian and human influenza subtypes will also neutralize H17. Furthermore the data presented in this study show a novel aspect of the N10 glycoprotein in its ability to facilitate the budding of pseudotypes bearing different influenza HAs.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila species communicate the presence of parasitoid wasps to naive individuals. This observation suggests a rudimentary Drosophila social structure. Communication between closely related species is efficient, while more distantly related species exhibit a dampened, partial communication. Partial communication between some species is enhanced following a period of cohabitation, suggesting that species-specific variations in communication \"dialects\" can be learned through social interactions. However, it remains unclear as to how the behavioral acquisition and how learning dialects is facilitated by distinct brain regions. In this study, we have identified six regions of the Drosophila brain essential for dialect learning, including the odorant receptor Or69a. Furthermore, we pinpoint subgroups of neurons such as motion detecting neurons in the optic lobe, layer 5 of the fan-shaped body, and the D glomerulus in the antennal lobe, where activation of each are necessary for dialect learning. These results demonstrate that Drosophila can display complex social behaviors with inputs to multiple regions of the Drosophila brain and unique subsets of neurons that must integrate olfactory, visual and motion cues.",

    "abstract": "RBM10 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing (AS). It localizes to the extra-nucleolar nucleoplasm and S1-1 nuclear bodies (NBs) in the nucleus. We investigated the biological significance of this localization in relation to its molecular function. Our analyses, employing deletion mutants, revealed that RBM10 possesses two S1-1 NB-targeting sequences (NBTSs), one in the KEKE motif region and another in the C2H2 Zn finger (ZnF). These NBTSs act synergistically to localize RBM10 to S1-1 NBs. The C2H2 ZnF not only acts as an NBTS, but is also essential for AS regulation by RBM10. Moreover, RBM10 does not participate in S1-1 NB formation, and without alterations of RBM10 protein levels, its NB-localization changes, increasing as cellular transcriptional activity declines, and vice versa. These results indicate that RBM10 is a transient component of S1-1 NBs and is sequestered in NBs via its NBTSs when cellular transcription decreases. We propose that the C2H2 ZnF exerts its NB-targeting activity when RBM10 is unbound by pre-mRNAs, and that NB-localization of RBM10 is a mechanism to control its AS activity in the nucleus.\n\nNote that the previous title of this manuscript was Targeting of RBM10 to S1-1 Nuclear Bodies: Targeting Sequences and its Biological Significance.",

CIC-DUX4 transgenic fish rapidly developed aggressive soft tissue tumors with a high penetrance. RNAseq profiling revealed that fish tumors shared major common targets with human tumors and cell lines, including the overexpression of the Pea3 transcription factors, etv4 and etv5. Tumor development was strongly impaired in etv4-deficient zebrafish, implicating Etv4 as a critical effector of CIC-DUX4-mediated oncogenesis. Altogether, we report here the first in vivo model of CIC-DUX4 sarcoma in zebrafish, which will represent a major tool for future preclinical research.",

    "abstract": "The glycolytic rate in neurons is low in order to allow glucose to be metabolized through the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), which regenerates NADPH to preserve the glutathione redox status and survival. This is controlled by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3), the pro-glycolytic enzyme that forms fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a powerful allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. In neurons, PFKFB3 protein is physiologically inactive due to its proteasomal degradation. However, upon an excitotoxic stimuli, PFKFB3 becomes stabilized to activate glycolysis, thus hampering PPP mediated protection of redox status leading to neurode-generation. Here, we show that selective inhibition of PFKFB3 activity in neurons by the small molecule AZ67 prevents the NADPH oxidation, redox stress and apoptotic neuronal death caused by activation of glycolysis upon excitotoxic stimuli. Furthermore, in vivo administration of AZ67 to mice significantly alleviated the motor discoordination and brain infarct injury in the middle carotid artery occlusion ischemia/reperfusion model. These results show that pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 is a suitable neuroprotective therapeutic strategy for excitotoxic-related neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Detecting the most relevant brain regions for explaining the distinction between cognitive conditions is one of the most sought after objectives in neuroimaging research. A popular approach for achieving this goal is the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) which is commonly conducted through the searchlight procedure as well as a number of other approaches. This is due to advantages of such methods which include being intuitive and flexible with regards to size of the search space. However, these approaches suffer from a number of limitations that lead to misidentification of truly informative voxels or clusters of voxels which in turn results in imprecise information maps. The limitations of such procedures mainly stem from several factors such as the fact that the information value of the search spheres are assigned to the voxel at the center of them (in case of searchlight), the requirement for manual tuning of parameters such as searchlight radius and shape and other optimization parameters, overlooking the structure and interactions within the regions, and the drawbacks of using regularization methods in analysis of datasets with characteristics of common fMRI data. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven maximum relevance minimum redundancy search algorithm for detecting precise information value of voxel-level clusters within brain regions while alleviating the above mentioned limitations. In order to make the algorithm efficient, we propose an implementation based on principles of dynamic programming. We evaluate and compare the proposed algorithm with the searchlight procedure using both real and synthetic datasets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn New South Wales (Australia) there has been substantial long term investment in school-based child obesity prevention programs. Whether these programs have led to population level improvements in childrens adiposity and weight-related behaviours in Aboriginal children, who are at greater risk of poorer health outcomes, is yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in adiposity and weight-related behaviours of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children and to examine the equality of changes between the two groups.\\n\\nMethodsRepresentative cross-sectional population surveys conducted in 2010 and 2015 among children age 5-16 years (n=15,613), stratified by Aboriginality. Indicators of weight-related behaviour (diet, physical activity, school travel, screen-time) were measured by questionnaire with parents responding for children age <10 years and self-report by children age >10 years. Objective measurements included height, weight, waist circumference, cardiorespiratory fitness, and fundamental movement skills.\\n\\nResultsAdiposity prevalences were significantly higher in 2015, than 2010 among non-Aboriginal children only, however adiposity prevalences were consistently higher among Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal children. There were positive changes towards adopting healthier weight-related behaviours in all children between surveys, which were consistently significant among non-Aboriginal, but not Aboriginal, children. The magnitude of changes and the 2015 prevalences in weight-related behaviours were generally similar for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children, however positive changes in fruit consumption and locomotor skills were significantly larger among Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal children. The prevalence of being driven to school in 2015 was significantly higher than 2010 for both groups.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, there are signs that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children are shifting towards healthier weight-related behaviours. However, many unhealthy weight-related behaviours remain highly prevalent. Our findings may have utility for the direction of future health policy and service delivery to Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children and the development of health promotion programs to build on these improvements in health behaviours.",

This study systematically compared seven antihypertensive drug classes for this purpose, using data on over 849,000 patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.\\n\\nMethodsTreatments for hypertension were assessed in an instrumental variable (IV) analysis to address potential confounding and reverse causation. Physicians prescribing preference was used as a categorical instrument, defined by the physicians last seven prescriptions. Participants were new antihypertensive users between 1996-2016, aged 40 and over.\\n\\nFindingsWe analysed 849,378 patients with total follow up of 5,497,266 patient-years. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers and vasodilator antihypertensives were found to confer small protective effects - for example, vasodilator antihypertensives resulted in 27 (95% CI: 17 to 38; p=4.4e-7) fewer cases of any dementia per 1000 treated compared with diuretics.\\n\\nInterpretationWe found small differences in antihypertensive drug class effects on risk of dementia outcomes. However, we show the magnitude of the differences between drug classes is smaller than previously reported. Future research should look to implement other causal analysis methods to address biases in conventional observational research with the ultimate aim of triangulating the evidence concerning this hypothesis.\\n\\nFundingThis work was supported by the Perros Trust and the Integrative Epidemiology Unit. The Integrative Epidemiology Unit is supported by the Medical Research Council and the University of Bristol [grant number MC_UU_00011/1, MC_UU_00011/3].\\n\\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA recent systematic review and meta-analysis has collated the evidence for treating hypertension to prevent dementia. Seven comparable observational studies were identified that used either case-control designs with logistic regression or cohort designs with survival analysis. These studies suggested that some classes, such as angiotensin-II receptor blockers, may prevent dementia. However, conventional observational analyses, such as these, can be subject to confounding and reverse causation.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyWe have provided new evidence about the potential effects of antihypertensives on risk of dementia through the novel application of instrumental variable analysis to this research question and have shown that the magnitude of the differences between drug classes is smaller than many observational studies have previously reported.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceFurther research is needed to triangulate this evidence with other sources and to understand the inconsistencies between the studies conducted to date. Ultimately, this will inform the prioritization of antihypertensive drug classes for dementia prevention.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSurvival and health status (e.g., symptoms and quality of life) are key outcomes in clinical trials of heart failure treatment. However, health status can only be recorded on survivors, potentially biasing treatment effect estimates when there is differential survival across treatment groups. Joint modeling of survival and health status can address this bias.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe analyzed patient-level data from the PARTNER 1B trial of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) versus standard care. Health status was quantified with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) at randomization, 1, 6, and 12 months. We compared hazard ratios for survival and mean differences in KCCQ scores at 12 months using several models: the original growth curve model for KCCQ scores (ignoring death), separate Bayesian models for survival and KCCQ scores, and a Bayesian joint longitudinal-survival model fit to either 12 or 30 months of survival follow-up. The benefit of TAVR on 12-month KCCQ scores was greatest in the joint model fit to all survival data (mean difference = 33.7 points; 95% CrI: 24.2, 42.4), followed by the joint model fit to 12 months of survival follow-up (32.3 points; 95% CrI: 22.5, 41.5), a Bayesian model without integrating death (30.4 points; 95% CrI: 21.4, 39.3), and the original growth curve model (26.0 points; 95% CI: 18.7, 33.3). At 12 months, the survival benefit of TAVR was also greater in the joint model (hazard ratio = 0.50; 95% CrI: 0.32, 0.73) than in the non-joint Bayesian model (0.54; 95% CrI: 0.37, 0.75) or the original Kaplan-Meier estimate (0.55; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.74).\\n\\nConclusionsIn patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and prohibitive surgical risk, the estimated benefits of TAVR on survival and health status compared with standard care were greater in joint Bayesian models than other approaches.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCholera remains a major public health concern, particularly in refugee camps, which may contend with overcrowding and scarcity of resources. Maela, the largest long-standing refugee camp in Thailand, experienced four cholera outbreaks between 2005 and 2010. In 2013, a cholera vaccine campaign was implemented in the camp. To assist in the evaluation of the campaign and planning for subsequent campaigns, we developed a mathematical model of cholera in Maela.\n\nMethodsWe formulated a Susceptible-Infectious-Water-Recovered-based cholera transmission model and estimated parameters using incidence data from 2010. We next evaluated the reduction in cases conferred by several immunization strategies, varying timing, effectiveness, and resources (i.e., vaccine availability). Finally, we generated post-campaign case forecasts, to determine whether a booster campaign was needed.\n\nResultsWe found that preexposure vaccination can substantially reduce the risk of cholera even when the < 50% of the population is given the full two-dose series. Additionally, the preferred number of doses per person should be considered in the context of one vs. two dose effectiveness and vaccine availability. For reactive vaccination, a trade-off between timing and effectiveness was revealed, indicating that it may be beneficial to give one dose to more people rather than two doses to fewer people, given that a two-dose schedule would incur a delay in administration of the second dose. Forecasting using realistic coverage levels predicted that there was no need for a booster campaign in 2014 (consistent with our predictions, there was not a cholera epidemic in the 2014 season).\n\nConclusionsOur analyses suggest that vaccination in conjunction with ongoing water sanitation and hygiene efforts provides an effective strategy for cholera outbreaks in refugee camps. Effective preexposure vaccination depends on timing and effectiveness. If a camp is facing an outbreak, delayed distribution of vaccines can substantially alter the effectiveness of reactive vaccination, suggesting that quick distribution of vaccines may be more important than ensuring every individual receives both vaccine doses.",

In a population based study including 5496 participants, the observed gap was significantly associated with the risk of dementia.\\n\\nMeaningThe gap between MRI-brain predicted and chronological age is potentially a biomarker for dementia risk screening.\\n\\nAbstractO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSThe gap between predicted brain age using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and chronological age may serve as biomarker for early-stage neurodegeneration and potentially as a risk indicator for dementia. However, owing to the lack of large longitudinal studies, it has been challenging to validate this link.\\n\\nObjectiveWe aimed to investigate the utility of such a gap as a risk biomarker for incident dementia in a general Dutch population, using a deep learning approach for predicting brain age based on MRI-derived grey matter maps.\\n\\nDesignData was collected from participants of the cohort-based Rotterdam Study who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging between 2006 and 2015. This study was performed in a longitudinal setting and all participant were followed up for incident dementia until 2016.\\n\\nSettingThe Rotterdam Study is a prospective population-based study, initiated in 1990 in the suburb Ommoord of in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\\n\\nParticipantsAt baseline, 5496 dementia- and stroke-free participants (mean age 64.67{+/-}9.82, 54.73% women) were scanned and screened for incident dementia. During 6.66{+/-}2.46 years of follow-up, 159 people developed dementia.\\n\\nMain outcomes and measuresWe built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict brain age based on its MRI. Model prediction performance was measured in mean absolute error (MAE). Reproducibility of prediction was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) computed on a subset of 80 subjects. Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards were used to assess the association of the age gap with incident dementia, adjusted for years of education, ApoE{varepsilon}4 allele carriership, grey matter volume and intracranial volume. Additionally, we computed the attention maps of CNN, which shows which brain regions are important for age prediction.\\n\\nResultsMAE of brain age prediction was 4.45{+/-}3.59 years and ICC was 0.97 (95% confidence interval CI=0.96-0.98). Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models showed that the age gap was significantly related to incident dementia (odds ratio OR=1.11 and 95% confidence intervals CI=1.05-1.16; hazard ratio HR=1.11 and 95% CI=1.06-1.15, respectively). Attention maps indicated that grey matter density around the amygdalae and hippocampi primarily drive the age estimation.\\n\\nConclusion and relevanceWe show that the gap between predicted and chronological brain age is a biomarker associated with risk of dementia development. This suggests that it can be used as a biomarker, complimentary to those that are known, for dementia risk screening.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSoil transmitted helminths (STH) infect >1.5 billion people. Mass drug administration (MDA) reduces infection; however, drug resistance is emerging and reinfection occurs rapidly. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh (WASH Benefits, NCT01590095) to assess whether water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition interventions, alone and combined, reduce STH in a setting with ongoing MDA.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe randomized clusters of pregnant women into water treatment, sanitation, handwashing, combined water+sanitation+handwashing (WSH), nutrition, nutrition+WSH (N+WSH) or control arms. After 2.5 years of intervention, we enumerated STH infections in children aged 2-12 years with Kato-Katz. We estimated intention-to-treat intervention effects on infection prevalence and intensity. Participants and field staff were not blinded; laboratory technicians and data analysts were blinded.\n\nIn 2012-2013, we randomized 5551 women in 720 clusters. In 2015-2016, we enrolled 7795 children of 4102 available women for STH follow-up and collected stool from 7187. Prevalence among controls was 36.8% for A. lumbricoides, 9.2% for hookworm and 7.5% for T. trichiura. Most infections were low-intensity. Compared to controls, the water intervention reduced hookworm (prevalence ratio [PR]=0.69 (0.50, 0.95), prevalence difference [PD]=-2.83 (-5.16, -0.50)) but did not affect other STH. Sanitation improvements reduced T. trichiura (PR=0.71 (0.52, 0.98), PD=-2.17 (-4.03, -0.38)), had a similar borderline effect on hookworm and no effect on A. lumbricoides. Handwashing and nutrition interventions did not reduce any STH. WSH and N+WSH reduced hookworm prevalence by 29-33% (2-3 percentage points) and marginally reduced A. lumbricoides. Effects on infection intensity were similar.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceIn a low-intensity infection setting with MDA, we found modest but sustained hookworm reduction from water treatment, sanitation and combined WSH interventions. Interventions more effectively reduced STH species with no persistent environmental reservoirs. Our findings highlight waterborne transmission for hookworm and suggest that water treatment and sanitation improvements can augment MDA programs to interrupt STH transmission.\n\nAuthor summarySoil-transmitted helminths (STH) infect >1.5 billion people worldwide. Mass-administration of deworming drugs is the cornerstone of global strategy for STH control but treated individuals often rapidly get reinfected and there is also concern about emerging drug resistance. Interventions to treat drinking water, wash hands at critical times and isolate human feces from the environment through improved sanitation could reduce STH transmission by reducing the spread of ova from the feces of infected individuals into the environment and subsequently to new hosts, while nutrition improvements could reduce host susceptibility to infection. Existing evidence on the effect of these interventions on STH is scarce. In a setting with ongoing mass-drug administration, we assessed the effect of individual and combined water, sanitation, handwashing and nutrition interventions on STH infection in children. Approximately 2.5 years after delivering interventions, we found reductions in STH infection from water treatment and sanitation interventions; there was no reduction from the handwashing and nutrition interventions. While the reductions were modest in magnitude compared to cure rates achieved by deworming drugs, they indicated sustained reduction in environmental transmission. The reductions were more pronounced for STH species that do not have persistent environmental reservoirs. These findings suggest that water treatment and sanitation interventions can augment mass-drug administration programs in striving toward elimination of STH.",

    "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious pubic health concern and known to have the adverse effects on mothers perinatal wellbeing; and childs physical and codnitive development. There were limited literatures on PPD in Bangladesh, especially in urban slum context. The aim of this study was to assess the burden and risk factors of PPD among the urban slum women. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November-December 2017 in three urban slums on 376 women within first 12 months of postpartum. A validated Bangla version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to measure the depression status. Respondents socio-economic characteristics and other risk factors were collected with structured validated questionaire by trained interviewers. Unadjusted Prevalence Ratio (PR) and Adjusted Prevalence Ratio (APR) were estimated with Generalized Linear Model(GLM) and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) respectively to identify the risk factors of PPD. The prevalence of PPD was 39.4% within first 12 months following the child birth. Job involvement after child delivery (APR=1.9, 95% CI= 1.1, 3.3), job loss due to pregnancy (APR=1.5, 95% CI= 1.0, 2.1), perinatal and postnatal death (APR=1.4, 95% CI= 0.97, 2.0), unintended pregnancy (APR=1.8, 95% CI= 1.3, 2.5), management of delivery cost by borrowing, selling or mortgaging assets (APR=1.3, 95% CI= 0.94, 1.9), depressive symptom during pregnancy (APR=2.5, 95% CI= 1.7, 3.8) and intimate partner violence (APR=2.0, 95% CI= 1.2, 3.3), were identified as risk factors. PPD was not associated with poverty, mother in law and any child related factors. The burden of postpartum depression is high in the urban slum of Bangladesh. Maternal mental health services should be integrated with existing maternal health services. Research is required for the innovation of effective, low cost and culturally appropriate PPD case management and preventive intervention in urban slum of Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "The recent outbreaks of the insect-vectored Zika virus have demonstrated its potential to be sexually transmitted, which complicates modeling and our understanding of disease dynamics. Autochthonous outbreaks in the US mainland may be a consequence of both modes of transmission, which affect the outbreak size, duration, and virus persistence. We propose a novel individual-based interconnected network model that incorporates both insect-vectored and sexual transmission of this pathogen. This model interconnects a homogeneous mosquito vector population with a heterogeneous human host contact network. The model incorporates the seasonal variation of mosquito abundance and characterizes host dynamics based on age group and gender in order to produce realistic projections. We use a sexual contact network which is generated on the basis of real world sexual behavior data. Our findings suggest that for a high relative transmissibility of asymptomatic hosts, Zika virus shows a high probability of sustaining in the human population for up to 3 months without the presence of mosquito vectors. Zika outbreaks are strongly affected by the large proportion of asymptomatic individuals and their relative transmissibility. The outbreak size is also affected by the time of the year when the pathogen is introduced. Although sexual transmission has a relatively low contribution in determining the epidemic size, it plays a role in sustaining the epidemic and creating potential endemic scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Electro-transfection is an essential workhorse tool for regulating cellular responses and engineering cellular materials in tissue engineering. However, existing approaches, including microfluidic platforms and bench top methods, are only able to study monolayer cell suspensions in vitro, and are incapable of clinical translation within in vivo tissue microenvironment. Knowledge regarding the three-dimensional (3D) electric field distribution and mass transport in a tissue microenvironment is lacking. However, building a 3D electro-transfection system that is compatible with 3D cell culture for mimicking in vivo tissue microenvironment is challenging, due to the substantial difficulties in control of 3D electric field distribution as well as the cellular growth. To address such challenges, we introduce a novel 3D micro-assembling strategy assisted by 3D printing, which enables the molding of 3D microstructures as LEGO(R) parts from 3D-printed molds. The molded PDMS LEGO(R) bricks are then assembled into a 3D-cell culture chamber interconnected with vertical and horizontal perfusion microchannels as a 3D channel network. Such 3D perfusion microchannel network is unattainable by direct 3D printing or other microfabrication approaches, which can facilitate the high-efficient exchange of nutrition and waste for 3D cell growth. Four flat electrodes are mounted into the 3D culture chamber via a 3D-printed holder and controlled by a programmable power sequencer for multi-directional electric frequency scanning (3D -electro-transfection). This multi-directional scanning not only can create transient pores all over the cell membrane, but also can generate local oscillation for enhancing mass transport and improving cell transfection efficiency. As a proof-of-concept, we electro-delivered pAcGFP1-C1 vector to 3D cultured HeLa cells within peptide hydrogel scaffolding. The expressed GFP level from transfected HeLa cells reflects the transfection efficiency. We found two key parameters including electric field strength and plasmid concentration playing more important roles than manipulating pulse duration and duty cycles. The results showed an effective transfection efficiency of ~15% with ~85% cell viability, which is a 3-fold increase compared to the conventional benchtop 3D cell transfection. This 3D -electrotransfection system was further used for genetically editing 3D-cultured Hek-293 cells via direct delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid which showed successful transfection with GFP expressed in the cytoplasm as the reporter. The 3D-printing enabled micro-assembly allows facile creation of novel 3D culture system for electro-transfection which can be employed for versatile gene delivery and cellular engineering, as well as building in-vivo like tissue models for fundamentally studying cellular regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "RationaleKinematic behavior during fast cervical rotations is a useful parameter for assessing sensorimotor control performances in neck-pain patients. However, in asymptomatic individuals from children to seniors, the influence of age still needs to be explored.\n\nAim and methodWe assessed the impact of age on sensorimotor control performance of the head-neck with execution time and kinematic variables (time of task, mean speed/acceleration/deceleration, overshoots, minimum/maximum speed) during standardized fast rotation target task using the DidRen Laser test. Eighty volunteers were stratified in four different age-groups: Children [8-14y]: n=16; Young Adults [18-35y]: n=29; Old Adults [36-64y]: n=18; Seniors [65-85y]: n=17.\n\nResultsTo perform the test, Children were slower compared to Young Adults (p<0.001) and Old Adults (p<0.001). It was also slower in Seniors compared to Young Adults (p<0.013). Mean speed was slower in Children and Seniors compared to Young Adults (p<0.001) and Old Adults (p<0.001). Mean acceleration was slower for Children compared to Young Adults (p<0.016) and Old Adults (p<0.015). Mean deceleration was slower for Children compared to Young Adults (p<0.001) and Old Adults (p<0.003).\n\nConclusionThe DidRen Laser test allows us to discriminate age-specific performances for mean speed, acceleration and deceleration. Seniors and Children needed to be slower to become as precise as Young and Old people, no difference was observed for overshoots which assesses accuracy of movement. Age must therefore be considered as a key parameter when analyzing execution time and kinematic results during DidRen Laser test.",

    "abstract": "A plethora of biological functions are performed through various types of protein-peptide binding. Prime examples include the protein kinase phosphorylation on peptide substrates and the binding of major histocompatibility complex to neoantigens in the immune system. Understanding the specificity of protein-peptide interactions is critical for unraveling the architectures of functional pathways and the mechanisms of cellular processes in human cells. Despite mass-spectrometric techniques were developed for the identification of protein-peptide interactions, our understanding of the preferences of proteins on their binding peptides is still rudimentary. As a complementary direction, a line of computational prediction methods has been recently proposed to predict protein-peptide bindings which efficiently provide rich functional annotations on a large scale. To achieve a high prediction accuracy, these computational methods require a sufficient amount of data to build the prediction model. However, the number of experimentally verified protein-peptide bindings is often limited in real cases. For example, a majority of protein kinases have very few experimentally verified phosphorylation sites (e.g., less than 30 sites) in existing databases. These methods are thus limited to building accurate prediction models for only well-characterized proteins with a large volume of known binding peptides and cannot be extended to predict new binding peptides for less-studied proteins. In this paper, we introduce a generic framework to address this issue of data scarcity in protein binding prediction. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. Our method uses an effective training strategy to build a prediction model with robust transferability. The model is able to predict the phosphorylation sites of a less-studied kinase, even if there is only a small number of phosphorylation sites known for this kinase. To achieve this, we train the model via a meta-learning phase followed by a few-shot learning phase. We demonstrate our framework has better transferability than state-of-the-art methods and is effective in utilizing limited data to accurately predict phosphorylation sites for less-characterized kinases. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/luoyunan/MetaKinase.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered to be a highly immunosuppressive and heterogenous neoplasm. Despite improved knowledge regarding the genetic background of the tumor and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1) has not been very successful against PDAC.\\n\\nThe robust desmoplastic stroma, along with an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in hyaluronan, plays an integral role in this immune evasion. Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), a shunt pathway of glycolysis, is a metabolic node in cancer cells that can promote survival pathways on one hand and influence the hyaluronan synthesis in the ECM on the other. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, glutamine-fructose amidotransferase (GFAT1), uses glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate to eventually synthesize UDP-GlcNAc.\\n\\nIn the current manuscript, we target this glutamine-utilizing enzyme by a small molecule glutamine analog (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine or DON). Our results show that DON decreases the self-renewal potential and metastatic ability of tumor cell. Further, treatment with DON results in a decrease in hyaluronan and collagen in the tumor microenvironment, leading to an extensive remodeling of the ECM. this in turn, increases CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells infiltration, and makes the tumors tumors more amenable and sensitive to anti-PD1 therapy.",

    "abstract": "During quiet wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and anesthesia, mammalian cortex exhibits a synchronised state during which transient changes in the local field potential (LFP) accompany periods of increased single neuron firing, known as UP-states. While UP-state genesis is still debated (Crunelli and Hughes, 2010) such transitions may constitute the default activity pattern of the entire cortex (Neske, 2016). Recent findings of preserved firing order between UP-state transitions and stimulus processing in high-firing rate (>2Hz) rat auditory and barrel cortex neurons (Luczak et al., 2015) support this hypothesis. Yet it is unknown whether UP-states are homogeneous and whether neurons with firing rates <2Hz in visual cortex or other species exhibit spiking order. Using extracellular recordings during anesthetized states in cat visual cortex and mouse visual, auditory and barrel cortex, we show that UP-states can be tracked and clustered based on the shape of the LFP waveform. We show that LFP event clusters (LECs) have current-source-density profiles that are common across different recordings or animals and using simultaneous electrophysiology and widefield voltage and calcium imaging in mouse we confirm that LEC transitions are cortex-wide phenomena. Individual LEC events can be resolved in time to within 1 - 4 ms and they elicit synchronous firing of over 75% of recorded neurons with most neurons synchronizing their firing to within {+/-}5 - 15 ms relative LECs. Firing order of different neurons during LEC events was preserved over periods of ~30 minutes enabling future studies of UP-state transitions and firing order with near millisecond precision.\\n\\nSignificant StatementDuring sleep and anesthetic states mammalian cortex undergoes substantial changes from awake active states. Recent studies show that single neurons in some cortical areas in rats undergo increased spiking during sleep and anesthetic states (called UP-state transitions) with some neurons firing in an order similar to awake states. This suggests that sensory processing may be similar across all states and that firing order is important for stimulus processing. Yet UP-state transitions remain poorly understood and it is unclear whether firing order is present in other cortical areas or species. Here we describe multiple classes of UP-state transitions and show most neurons in visual cortex in cats and visual, barrel and auditory cortex in mice exhibit firing order during such transitions.",

    "abstract": "Cross frequency coupling (CFC) is emerging as a fundamental feature of brain activity, correlated with brain function and dysfunction. Many different types of CFC have been identified through application of numerous data analysis methods, each developed to characterize a specific CFC type. Choosing an inappropriate method weakens statistical power and introduces opportunities for confounding effects. To address this, we propose a statistical modeling framework to estimate high frequency amplitude as a function of both the low frequency amplitude and low frequency phase; the result is a measure of phase-amplitude coupling that accounts for changes in the low frequency amplitude. We show in simulations that the proposed method successfully detects CFC between the low frequency phase or amplitude and the high frequency amplitude, and outperforms an existing method in biologically-motivated examples. Applying the method to in vivo data, we illustrate how CFC evolves during seizures and is affected by electrical stimuli.",
