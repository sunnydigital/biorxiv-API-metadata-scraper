    "abstract": "Astyanax mexicanus is a well-established and widely used fish model system for evolutionary and developmental biology research. These fish exist as surface forms that inhabit rivers and 30 different populations of cavefish. The establishment of A. mexicanus as an emergent model organism for understanding the evolutionary basis of development and behavior has been accelerated by an increasing availability of genomic approaches to identify genotype-phenotype associations. Despite important progress in the deployment of new technologies, deep mechanistic insights into A. mexicanus evolution and development have been limited by a lack of transgenic lines commonly used in genetic model systems. Here, we expand the toolkit of transgenesis by characterizing two novel stable transgenic lines that were generated using the highly efficient Tol2 system, commonly used to generate transgenic zebrafish. A stable transgenic line consisting of the zebrafish ubiquitin promoter fused to eGFP expressed eGFP ubiquitously throughout development in a surface population of Astyanax. To define specific cell-types, we injected fish with a Cntnap2-mCherry construct that labels lateral line mechanosensory neurons in zebrafish. Strikingly, both constructs appear to label the predicted cell types, suggesting many genetic tools and defined promoter regions in zebrafish are directly transferrable to cavefish. The lines provide proof-of-principle for the application of Tol2 transgenic technology in A. mexicanus. Expansion on these initial transgenic lines will provide a platform to address broadly important problems in the quest to bridge the genotype to phenotype gap.",

    "abstract": "O_LIMeasurement error and other forms of uncertainty are commonplace in ecology and evolution and may bias estimates of parameters of interest. Although a variety of approaches to obtain unbiased estimators are available, these often require that errors are explicitly modeled and that a latent model for the unobserved error-free variable can be specified, which in practice is often difficult.\nC_LIO_LIHere we propose to generalize a heuristic approach to correct for measurement error, denoted as simulation extrapolation (SIMEX), to situations where explicit error modeling fails. We illustrate the application of SIMEX using the example of estimates of quantitative genetic parameters, e. g. inbreeding depression and heritability, in the presence of pedigree errors. Following the original SIMEX idea, the error in the pedigree is progressively increased to determine how the estimated quantities are affected by error. The observed trend is then extrapolated back to a hypothetical error-free pedigree, yielding unbiased estimates of inbreeding depression and heritability. We term this application of the SIMEX idea to pedigrees \"PSIMEX\". We tested the method with simulated pedigrees with different pedigree structures and initial error proportions, and with real field data from a free-living population of song sparrows.\nC_LIO_LIThe simulation study indicates that the accuracy and precision of the extrapolated error-free estimate for inbreeding depression and heritability are good. In the application to the song sparrow data, the error-corrected results could be validated against the actual values thanks to the availability of both an error-prone and an error-free pedigree, and the results indicate that the PSIMEX estimator is close to the actual value. For easy accessibility of the method, we provide the novel R-package PSIMEX.\nC_LIO_LIBy transferring the SIMEX philosophy to error in pedigrees, we have illustrated how this heuristic approach can be generalized to situations where explicit latent models for the unobserved variables or for the error of the variables of interest are difficult to formulate. Thanks to the simplicity of the idea, many other error problems in ecology and evolution might be amenable to SIMEX-like error correction methods.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Some images are easy to remember while others are easily forgotten. While variation in image memorability is consistent across individuals, we lack a full account of its neural correlates. By analyzing data collected from inferotemporal cortex (IT) as monkeys performed a visual memory task, we demonstrate that a simple property of the visual encoding of an image, its population response magnitude, is strongly correlated with its memorability. These results establish a novel behavioral role for the magnitude of the IT response, which lies largely orthogonal to the coding scheme that IT uses to represent object identity. To investigate the origin of IT memorability modulation, we also probed convolutional neural network models trained to categorize objects. We found brain-analogous correlates of memorability that grew in strength across the hierarchy of these networks, suggesting that this memorability correlate is likely to arise from the optimizations required for visual as opposed to mnemonic processing.",

    "abstract": "How animal neural system addresses the object identity-preserving recognition problem is largely unknown. Artificial neural network such as convolution network (CNN) has reached human level performance in recognition tasks, however, animal neural system does not support such kernel scanning operation across retinal neurons, and thus the neuronal responses do not match that of CNN units. Here, we used an alternative recognition-reconstruction network (RRN) architecture as an analogy to animal-like system, and the resulting neural characteristics agreed fairly well with electrophysiological measurements in monkey studies. First, in network development study, the RRN also experienced critical developmental stages characterized by specificities in neuronal types, connectivity strength and firing pattern, from early stage of coarse salience map recognition to mature stage of fine structure recognition. In digit recognition study, we witnessed that the RRN could maintain object invariance representation under various viewing conditions by coordinated adjustment of responses of population neurons. And such concerted population responses contained untangled object identity and properties information that could be accurately extracted via a simple weighted summation decoder. In the learning and forgetting study, novel structure recognition was implemented by adjusting entire synapses in low magnitude while pattern specificities of original synaptic connectivity were preserved, which guaranteed a learning process without disrupting the existing functionalities. This work benefits the understanding of human neural mechanism and the development of humane-like intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Even if all external circumstances are kept equal, the oculomotor system shows intra-individual variability over time, affecting measures such as microsaccade rate, blink rate, pupil size, and gaze position. Recently, some of these measures have been associated with ADHD on a between-subject level. However, it remains unclear to what extent these measures constitute stable individual traits. In the current study, we investigate the intra-individual reliability of these oculomotor features. Combining results over three experiments (> 100 healthy participants), we find that most measures show good intra-individual reliability over different time points (repeatability) as well as over different conditions (generalisation). However, we find evidence against any correlation with self-assessed ADHD tendencies, mind wandering, and impulsivity. As such, the oculomotor system shows reliable intra-individual reliability, but its benefit for investigating self-assessed individual differences in healthy subjects remains unclear. With our results, we highlight the importance of reliability and statistical power when studying between-subject differences.",

Studies on the correlation between Brucella antibody titers and clinical outcomes are limited. Therefore, this study assessed such correlation and evaluated the correlation between baseline serologic results with culture positivity and clinical picture. Patients tested positive for Brucella antibodies at baseline and diagnosed with brucellosis between January 2008 and December 2018 were included. Collected data included clinical outcomes, baseline culture positivity, arthralgia, baseline and EOT temperature, white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Of 695 patients tested for Brucella antibodies, only 94 had positive baseline serology and diagnosed with brucellosis, among whom 63 had EOT serology. No significant correlations were found between EOT antibody titers of both Brucella spp. and clinical cure, mortality, length of stay, and duration of therapy. Additionally, no correlations were found between baseline serology and culture positivity, arthralgia, temperature, and other lab values. Brucella serology does not correlate with clinical outcomes at EOT nor with culture positivity at baseline. Therefore, healthcare providers are advised to consider the whole clinical picture of a brucellosis patient without relying solely on serologic results during follow up and not replace culturing with serology testing alone at the time of diagnosis.",

The distribution of these isoforms in different cell types, as well as their role in AD pathology still remains unclear. Utilizing antibodies targeting specific BIN1 epitopes in human postmortem tissue and analyzing RNA expression data from purified microglia, we identified three isoforms expressed specifically in neurons (isoforms 1, 2 and 3) and four isoforms expressed in microglia (isoforms 6, 9, 10 and 12). The abundance of selected peptides, which correspond to groups of BIN1 protein isoforms, was measured in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and their relation to neuropathological features of AD was assessed. Peptides contained in exon 7 of BIN1s N-BAR domain were found to be significantly associated with AD-related traits and, particularly, tau pathology. Since only isoforms 1, 2 and 3 contain exon 7, it appears that decreased protein expression of the N-BAR domain of BIN1 is associated with greater accumulation of tau pathology and subsequent cognitive decline, with astrocytic rather than neuronal BIN1 being the more likely culprit. These effects are independent of the BIN1 AD risk variant, suggesting that targeting specific BIN1 isoforms might be a novel therapeutic approach to prevent the accumulation of tau pathology.",

To close this gap between invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology we developed and recorded human-comparable EEG in macaque monkeys during visual stimulation with colored dynamic random dot patterns. Furthermore, we performed simultaneous microelectrode recordings from 6 areas of macaque cortex and human MEG. Motion direction and color information were accessible in all signal types. Tuning of the non-invasive signals was similar to V4 and IT, but not to dorsal and frontal areas. Thus, MEG and EEG were dominated by early visual and ventral stream sources. Source level analysis revealed corresponding information and latency gradients across the cortex. We show how information-based methods and monkey EEG can identify analogous properties of visual processing in signals spanning spatial scales from single units to MEG - a valuable framework for relating human and animal studies.",

We demonstrate that live cells are ~80 times less susceptible to the 660 nm incident light compared to 532 nm light, which overall allows Brillouin imaging of up to more than 30 times higher SNR. We show that this improvement enables Brillouin imaging of live biological samples with improved accuracy, higher speed and/or larger fields of views with denser sampling.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with episodic memory decline and alterations in memory-related brain function. However, it remains unclear if age-related memory decline is associated with similar patterns of brain aging in women and men. In the current task fMRI study, we tested the hypothesis that there are sex differences in the effect of age and memory performance on brain activity during episodic encoding and retrieval of face-location associations (spatial context memory). Forty-one women and 41 men between the ages of 21 to 76 years participated in this study. Between-group multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis of the fMRI data was conducted to directly test for sex-group differences and similarities in age-related and performance-related patterns of brain activity. Our behavioural analysis indicated no significant sex differences in retrieval accuracy on the fMRI tasks. In relation to performance effects, we observed similarities and differences in how retrieval accuracy related to brain activity in women and men. Both sexes activated dorsal and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) at encoding and this supported subsequent memory performance. However, there were sex differences in retrieval activity in these same regions and in lateral occipital-temporal and ventrolateral PFC. In relation to age effects, we observed sex differences in the effect of age on memory-related activity within PFC, IPC, PHG and lateral occipital-temporal cortices. Overall, our findings suggest that the neural correlates of age-related spatial context memory decline differ in women compared to men.",

    "abstract": "Countermanding behavior has long been seen as a cornerstone of executive control - the human ability to selectively inhibit undesirable responses and change plans. In recent years, however, scattered evidence has emerged that stopping behavior is entangled with simpler automatic stimulus-response mechanisms. Here we give flesh to this idea by merging the latest conceptualization of saccadic countermanding with a versatile neural network model of visuo-oculomotor behavior that integrates bottom-up and top-down drives. This model accounts for all fundamental qualitative and quantitative features of saccadic countermanding, including neuronal activity. Importantly, it does so by using the same architecture and parameters as basic visually guided behavior and automatic stimulus-driven interference. Using simulations and new data, we compare the temporal dynamics of saccade countermanding with that of saccadic inhibition (SI), a hallmark effect thought to reflect automatic competition within saccade planning areas. We demonstrate how SI accounts for a large proportion of the saccade countermanding process when using visual signals. We conclude that top-down inhibition acts later, piggy-backing on the quicker automatic inhibition. This conceptualization fully accounts for the known effects of signal features and response modalities traditionally used across the countermanding literature. Moreover, it casts different light on the concept of top-down inhibition, its timing and neural underpinning, as well as the interpretation of stop-signal reaction time, the main behavioral measure in the countermanding literature.",

Maintenance of genomic stability and proper regulation of cell cycle checkpoints play a critical role in preventing the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Perturbations in the expression or activity of mediators of cell cycle progression or checkpoint activation represent important events that may increase susceptibility to the onset of carcinogenesis. The atypical cyclin-like protein Spy1 was isolated in a screen for novel genes that could bypass the DNA damage response. Clinical data demonstrates that protein levels of Spy1 are significantly elevated in ductal and lobular carcinoma of the breast. Using a transgenic mouse driving expression of Spy1 in the mammary epithelium we demonstrate that sustained elevation of Spy1 leads to enhanced proliferation and an increased susceptibility to mammary tumour formation. We find that Spy1 is targeted for degradation by the tumour suppressor p53 to protect checkpoint control. When crossed with p53 deficient mice, elevation of Spy1 leads to an increase in hyperplastic alveolar nodules. Targeting cyclin-like protein activity may therefore represent a mechanism of re-sensitizing cells to important cell cycle checkpoints in a therapeutic setting.",

    "abstract": "The world population aged 60 years and older is expected to double between 2015 and 2050. Aging is associated with a decline in cognitive and motor performances which are a part of geriatric syndromes. Aging is also associated with the loss of cerebellar volume where the cerebellum has a considerable contribution in cognitive and motor functions. Therefore, cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) has been proposed to study and facilitate cerebellar function during aging. However, the one-size-fits-all approach used for ctDCS can lead to variability in the cerebellar lobule-specific dosing due to age-related changes in the cerebellar structure. Therefore, we investigated lobular electric field (EF) distribution during healthy aging for age groups of 18 to 89 years where computational modeling was based on age-appropriate human brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) templates (http://jerlab.psych.sc.edu/NeurodevelopmentalMRIDatabase/). A fully automated open-source pipeline (Realistic vOlumetric-Approach to Simulate Transcranial Electric Stimulation - ROAST) was used for the age-group specific EF modeling. Then, we extracted the EF distribution at the 28 cerebellar lobules based on a spatially unbiased atlas (SUIT) for the cerebellum. Our computational results showed that the EF strength increased significantly at certain important cerebellar lobules (e.g., Crus I and Crus II relevant for cognitive function) contralateral (contra) to the targeted (ipsi) cerebellar hemisphere at an older age that reduced the ctDCS specificity. Specifically, two-way ANOVA showed that the lobules as well as the age-group (and their interaction term) had a significant effect (p<0.01). Post-hoc multiple comparison tests at Alpha=0.01 using Bonferroni critical values showed that Right (Ipsi) Crus I, Right (Ipsi) Crus II, Right (Ipsi) VI, Vermis VIIb, Vermis VIIIa, Right (Ipsi) VIIb, Left (Contra) VIIIb, Left (Contra) IX, Right (Ipsi) VIIIa, Right (Ipsi) VIIIb, Vermis VIIIb, Right (Ipsi) IX, and Vermis IX, and the age-group 18, 18.5, 19, 20-24, 45-49, 50-54, 70-74, 75-79, 85-89 years experienced higher electric field strength (>0.11V/m). Since there is a dichotomy between the sensorimotor cerebellum and the cognitive cerebellum, therefore, subject-specific MRI based head modeling for lobule-specific dosage considerations will be necessary for clinical translation of ctDCS to address geriatric cerebellar syndromes.",
