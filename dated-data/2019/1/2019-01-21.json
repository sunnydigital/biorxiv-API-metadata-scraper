    "abstract": "Cost-effective next-generation sequencing has made unbiased gene expression analysis possible. Single-neuron gene expression studies may be especially important for understanding nervous system structure and function because of the neuron-specific functionality and plasticity that defines functional neural circuits. Cellular dissociation is a prerequisite technical manipulation for single-cell and single cell-population studies, but the extent to which the cellular dissociation process cells affects neural gene expression has not been determined, nor has it been determined how gene expression is altered by the stress that accompanies many of the behavioral manipulations that are required to study learning and memory and other cognitive functions. Here, we determined to which extent cellular dissociation-induced changes in hippocampal gene expression might confound studies on the behavioral and physiological functions of the hippocampus. We processed tissue punch samples from the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 hippocampus subfields using either a tissue homogenization protocol or a cellular dissociation protocol in preparation for RNA sequencing analysis to evaluate the impact of the tissue preparation. Then, we evaluated the effect of stressful experience and cognitive training on hippocampus subfield specific gene expression and determined to which extent these response overlap with the cellular dissociation response. Finally, we assessed the extent to which the subfield-specific gene expression patterns are consistent with those identified in a recently published hippocampus subfield-specific gene expression database. We report substantial differences in baseline subfield-specific gene expression, that 1% of the hippocampal transcriptome is altered by the process of cellular dissociation, that an even weaker alteration is detected 24 h after stressful experience, and that while these alterations are largely distinct from the subfield specific response of the hippocampus transcriptome to cognitive training, there is nonetheless some important confounding overlap. These findings of the concordant and discordant effects of technical and behavioral manipulations should inform the design of future neural transcriptome studies and thus facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of hippocampal function.",

    "abstract": "Complexity is a fundamental attribute of life. Complex systems are made of parts that together perform functions that a single component, or subsets containing individual components, cannot. Examples of complex molecular systems include protein structures such as the F1Fo-ATPase, the ribosome, or the flagellar motor: each one of these structures requires most or all of its components to function properly. Given the ubiquity of complex systems in the biosphere, understanding the evolution of complexity is central to biology. At the molecular level, operons are a classic example of a complex system. An operons genes are co-transcribed under the control of a single promoter to a polycistronic mRNA molecule, and the operons gene products often form molecular complexes or metabolic pathways. With the large number of complete bacterial genomes available, we now have the opportunity to explore the evolution of these complex entities, by identifying possible intermediate states of operons. In this work, we developed a maximum parsimony algorithm to reconstruct ancestral operon states, and show a simple vertical evolution model of how operons may evolve from the individual component genes. We describe several ancestral states that are plausible functional intermediate forms leading to the full operon. We also offer Reconstruction of Ancestral Gene blocks Using Events or ROAGUE as a software tool for those interested in exploring gene block and operon evolution.\\n\\nThe software accompanying this paper is available under GPLv3 license in: https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/Ancestral-Blocks-Reconstruction.\\n\\nAll figures in this paper are available in enlarged downloadable form from:https://github.com/nguyenngochuy91/Ancestral-Blocks-Reconstruction/tree/master/images",

    "abstract": "AbstractsThe spatial and temporal dynamics of cell contractility plays a key role in tissue morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer invasion. Here we report a simple, single cell resolution, optochemical method to induce reversible minute-scale cell contractions in vivo during morphogenesis. We employed the photolabile Ca2+ chelator o-nitrophenyl EGTA to induce bursts of intracellular free Ca2+ by laser photolysis. Ca2+ bursts appear within seconds and are restricted to individual target cells. Cell contraction reliably followed within a minute, to about half of the cross-sectional area. Increased Ca2+ levels and contraction were reversible and the target cells further participated in tissue morphogenesis. Cell contractions are paralleled with non-muscle myosin-II accumulation in the apico-medial cortex, indicating that Ca2+ bursts trigger non-muscle myosin II activation. Our approach can be easily adapted to many experimental systems and species, as no specific genetic elements are required and a widely used reagent is employed.",

    "abstract": "Heterochrony, defined as differences in the timing of developmental processes, impacts organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration. The molecular basis of heterochrony in mammalian tissues is poorly understood. We report that Hedgehog signaling activates a heterochronic pathway that controls differentiation timing in multiple lineages. A differentiation trajectory from second heart field cardiac progenitors to first heart field cardiomyocytes was identified by single-cell transcriptional profiling in mouse embryos. A survey of developmental signaling pathways revealed specific enrichment for Hedgehog signaling targets in cardiac progenitors. Removal of Hh signaling caused loss of progenitor and precocious cardiomyocyte differentiation gene expression in the second heart field in vivo. Introduction of active Hh signaling to mESC-derived progenitors, modelled by transient expression of the Hh-dependent transcription factor GLI1, delayed differentiation in cardiac and neural lineages in vitro. A shared GLI1-dependent network in both cardiac and neural progenitors was enriched with FOX family transcription factors. FOXF1, a GLI1 target, was sufficient to delay onset of the cardiomyocyte differentiation program in progenitors, by epigenetic repression of cardiomyocyte-specific enhancers. Removal of active Hh signaling or Foxf1 expression from second heart field progenitors caused precocious cardiac differentiation in vivo, establishing a mechanism for resultant Congenital Heart Disease. Together, these studies suggest that Hedgehog signaling directly activates a gene regulatory network that functions as a heterochronic switch to control differentiation timing across developmental lineages.",

    "abstract": "The phenotype of one individual can be affected not only by the individuals own genotypes (direct genetic effects, DGE) but also by genotypes of interacting partners (indirect genetic effects, IGE). IGE have been detected using polygenic models in multiple species, including laboratory mice and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Genome-wide association studies of IGE (igeGWAS) can point to IGE genes, but have not yet been applied to non-familial IGE arising from \"peers\" and affecting biomedical phenotypes. In addition, the extent to which igeGWAS will identify loci not identified by dgeGWAS remains an open question. Finally, findings from igeGWAS have not been confirmed by experimental manipulation.\n\nWe leveraged a dataset of 170 behavioural, physiological and morphological phenotypes measured in 1,812 genetically heterogeneous laboratory mice to study IGE arising between same-sex, adult, unrelated laboratory mice housed in the same cage. We developed methods for igeGWAS in this context and identified 24 significant IGE loci for 17 phenotypes (FDR < 10%). There was no overlap between IGE loci and DGE loci for the same phenotype, which was consistent with the moderate genetic correlations between DGE and IGE for the same phenotype estimated using polygenic models. Finally, we fine-mapped seven significant IGE loci to individual genes and confirmed, in an experiment with a knockout model, that Epha4 gives rise to IGE on stress-coping strategy and wound healing.\n\nOur results demonstrate the potential for igeGWAS to identify IGE genes and shed some light into the mechanisms of peer influence.",

    "abstract": "The brain demands constant supply of glucose-derived energy for cell metabolism and survival, and brain hypoglycemia may compromise synaptic functions. The brainstem nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) is an integrative center for autonomic counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia, and recent evidences have demonstrated that NTS neurons can also sense fluctuations in glucose levels in the extracellular milieu. Glucose-sensing neurons rely on glucose metabolism to respond to changes in glucose availability, but the ionic mechanisms underlying the low-glucose sensitivity are not well elucidated in NTS neurons. Therefore, this work aimed to investigate the effect of low extracellular glucose (0.5 mM) on the electrophysiological properties of NTS neurons of rats, by whole-cell patch-clamp. We showed that in NTS neurons maintained in 5 mM extracellular glucose, low glucose induces a depolarization in most neurons, which was correlated with membrane potential, decreased with depolarization. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels contribute to the hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) of NTS neurons, and blockage of KATP channels produced depolarization of the membrane and occludes the effect of low glucose, thus acting as modulators of low-glucose sensing in NTS neurons. However, this effect is caused by depolarization, since membrane hyperpolarization after KATP blockage restores the effect of low glucose. Additionally, we demonstrated that the incubation of NTS neurons in high glucose (10 mM) prior to recordings leads to more depolarized RMP in these neurons, what contributes to increase the number of neurons unresponsive to a low-glucose challenge, possibly via depolarization by inhibition of KATP channels following increased amounts of high glucose-derived intracellular ATP. We conclude that NTS neurons depolarize the membrane in response to the application of a low-glucose solution, but this effect is occluded by membrane depolarization triggered by KATP blockage. This suggests a homeostatic regulation of the membrane potential by glucose.",

    "abstract": "Calcium imaging has revolutionized systems neuroscience, providing the ability to image large neural populations with single-cell resolution. The resulting datasets are quite large (with scales of TB/hour in some cases), which has presented a barrier to routine open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem, and are highly effective when good initializations are available, but can break down e.g. in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail.\\n\\nHere we introduce an improved approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD) of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated) noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon, widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets): in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of 20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our new approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from the video data.",

    "abstract": "Active sensing has been well documented in animals that use echolocation and electrolocation. Active photolocation, or active sensing using light, has received much less attention, and only in bioluminescent nocturnal species. Recently, however, evidence has suggested the diurnal triplefin Tripterygion delaisi uses controlled iris radiance, termed ocular sparks, for prey-detection. While this form of diurnal active photolocation was behaviourally described, a study exploring the complete physical and theoretical process would provide a more compelling case supporting this mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which diurnal active photolocation could assist T. delaisi in detecting potential prey items. In the field, we sampled prey gammarids (Genus Cheirocratus) from foraging substrates, and characterized the spectral properties of their body and eyes, which possess strong reflectors between the ommatidia. In the laboratory, we quantified ocular spark sizes and the angular dependence of their radiance. Together with environmental light measurements and the visual properties of T. delaisi, we modeled diurnal active photolocation under various scenarios. Our results corroborate that diurnal active photolocation can help T. delaisi detect gammarids at distances relevant to foraging, 4.5 cm under favourable conditions and up to 2.5 cm under average conditions. Because ocular sparks are widespread across many different fish species, diurnal active photolocation for micro-prey may be a common predation strategy.",

    "abstract": "In perceptual decision making the brain extracts and accumulates decision evidence from a stimulus over time and eventually makes a decision based on the accumulated evidence. Several characteristics of this process have been observed in human electrophysiological experiments, especially an average build-up of motor-related signals supposedly reflecting accumulated evidence, when averaged across trials. A more direct approach to investigate the representation of decision evidence in brain signals is to correlate the trial-to-trial fluctuations of a model-based prediction of evidence with the measured signals. We here report results for an experiment in which we applied this approach to human magnetoencephalographic recordings. These results consolidate a range of previous findings and suggest that decision evidence is processed in three consecutive phases in the human brain: In an early phase around 120 ms after the evidence became visible on the screen, in a transition phase around 180 ms and a plateau phase roughly from 300 to 500 ms. We located sources of evidence representations in these phases in early visual (early), parietal (transition) and motor (plateau) regions of the brain while signals in posterior cingulate cortex represented decision evidence in all three phases. These findings imply that parietal cortex is only transiently involved in the processing of decision evidence, that motor areas represent accumulated evidence throughout decision making and that posterior cingulate cortex may have a central role in processing and maintaining decision evidence.",

By visualizing chromosome architecture and gene expression simultaneously in single nuclei, we were able to unveil the changes in 3D chromatin organization occurring upon transcriptional activation and homologous chromosome un-pairing. Excitingly, the ability of Hi-M to explore the multi-scale chromosome architecture in time and space will be key to understand the mechanisms and consequences of the 4D organization of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Our brain processes information through the coordinated efforts of billions of individual neurons, each of which transforms a small part of the overall information stream. Central to this is how neurons integrate and transform complex patterns of synaptic inputs. The neuronal membrane impedance determines the change in membrane potential in response to input currents, and therefore sets the gain and timing for synaptic integration. Using single and dual dendritic recordings in vivo, pharmacology, and computational modeling, we characterized the role of two active conductances gH and gM, meditated respectively by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channels and by muscarine sensitive M-channels, in shaping the membrane impedance of a collision detection neuron in female Schistocerca americana grasshoppers. The neuron is known by its acronym LGMD, which stands for lobula giant movement detector. In contrast to other neurons where these conductances have been studied, we found that gH and gM promote broadband, synchronous integration over the LGMDs functional range of membrane potentials and input frequencies. Additionally, we found that the branching morphology of the LGMD helped increase both the gain and synchrony associated with the neurons membrane impedance. The same result held for a wide range of dendritic morphologies, including those of mammalian neocortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Thus, these findings further our understanding of the integration properties of individual neurons by showing the unexpected role played by two widespread active conductances and by dendritic morphology in shaping synaptic integration.\\n\\nSignificance StatementInformation in the brain is processed by neurons that receive thousands of synaptic inputs. Understanding how neurons integrate these inputs is critical to neuroscience. Neuronal integration depends on complex interactions of synaptic input patterns and the electrochemical properties of dendrites. Although examining the input patterns and dendritic processing in vivo is not yet possible in the mammalian brain, it is within simpler nervous systems. Here, we used an identified collision detection neuron in grasshoppers to examine how its morphology and membrane properties determine the gain and synchrony of synaptic integration in relation to the computations it performs. The neuronal properties examined are ubiquitous and therefore will further a general understanding of neuronal computations, including those in our own brain.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial focused ultrasound has the promise to evolve into a transformative noninvasive way to modulate activity of neuronal circuits deep in the brain. The approach may enable systematic and causal mapping of how individual brain circuits are involved in specific behaviors and behavioral disorders. Previous studies demonstrated neuromodulatory potential, but the effect polarity, size, and spatial specificity have been difficult to assess. Here, we engaged non-human primates (macaca mulatta) in an established task that provides a well defined framework to characterize the neuromodulatory effects. In this task, subjects decide whether to look at a right or a left target, guided by one the targets appearing first. Previous studies showed that excitation/inhibition of oculomotor circuits leads to contralateral/ipsilateral biases in this choice behavior. We found that brief, low-intensity ultrasound stimuli (300 ms, 0.6 MPa, 270 kHz) delivered to the animals left/right frontal eye fields bias the animals decisions to the right/left visual hemifield. The effect was modest, about on the order of that produced when injecting moderate amounts of potent neuromodulatory drugs into the same regions in this task. The polarity of the effects suggested a neuronal excitation within the stimulated regions. No effects were observed when we applied the same stimuli to control brain regions not involved in oculomotor target selection. Together, using an established paradigm, we found that transcranial ultrasound is capable of modulating neurons to the extent of biasing choice behavior of non-human primates. A demonstration of tangible, double-dissociated effects on behavior of primates constitutes a critical step toward applying this noninvasive neuromodulation method in investigations of how specific neural circuits are involved in specific behaviors or disease signs.",

Here, we propose a biologically realistic and unifying approach to emergent pattern formation. Our biphasic model of multicellular tissues incorporates turnover and transport of morphogens controlling cell differentiation and tissue mechanics in a single framework, where one tissue phase consists of a poroelastic network made of cells and the other is the extracellular fluid permeating between cells. While this model encompasses previous theories approximating tissues to inert monophasic media, such as Turings reaction-diffusion model, it overcomes some of their key limitations permitting pattern formation via any two-species biochemical kinetics thanks to mechanically induced cross-diffusion flows. Moreover, we unravel a qualitatively different advection-driven instability which allows for the formation of patterns with a single morphogen and which single mode pattern scales with tissue size. We discuss the potential relevance of these findings for tissue morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) have been widely studied, yet there is a lack of understanding with regards to the final size and properties of these networks, mainly due to no network is currently complete. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of GRN structural properties across a large set of distinct prokaryotic organisms and found a set of constrained characteristics such as network density and number of regulators. Our results allowed us to estimate the number of interactions that complete networks would have, a valuable insight that could aid in the daunting task of network curation, prediction, and validation. Using state-of-the-art statistical approaches, we also provided new evidence to settle a previously stated controversy that raised the possibility of complete biological networks being random. Therefore, attributing the observed scale-free properties to an artifact emerging from the sampling process during network discovery. Furthermore, we identified a set of properties that enabled us to assess the consistency of the connectivity distribution for various GRNs against different alternative statistical distributions. Our results favor the hypothesis that highly connected nodes (hubs) are not a consequence of network incompleteness. Finally, an interaction coverage computed for the GRNs as a proxy for completeness revealed that high-throughput based reconstructions of GRNs could yield biased networks with a low average clustering coefficient, showing that classical targeted discovery of interactions is still needed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project contain data on profiling of thousands of tumors with different-omics approaches, providing a valuable source of information which may be used to decipher cancer signaling and related alterations. Managing and analyzing data from large-scale projects such as TCGA is a demanding task. Indeed, it is difficult to dissect the high complexity hidden in genomic data and to adequately account for tumor heterogeneity.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we used a robust statistical framework along with the integration of diverse bioinformatic tools to analyze next-generation sequencing data from more than 1000 patient samples from two different lung cancer subtypes, i.e., the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and the squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In particular, we used RNA-Seq gene expression data to identify both co-expression modules and differentially expressed genes to accurately discriminate between LUAD and LUSC. Moreover, we identified a group of genes which could act as specific oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in one of the two lung cancer types, as well as two dual role genes. Our results have also been cross-validated against other transcriptomics data of lung cancer patients.\\n\\nConclusionsOur integrative approach allowed to identify two key features: a substantial up-regulation of genes involved in O-glycosylation of mucins in LUAD, and a compromised immune response in LUSC. The immune-profile associated with LUSC is linked to the activation of three specific oncogenic pathways which promote the evasion of antitumor immune response, providing new future directions for the design of target therapies.",

    "abstract": "An ideal model of perceptual processing would be congruent with experimentally-observed perceptual performance and be theoretically generalizable. In the extant models with experimental predictive power, the most-invoked signal processing paradigms are rate-distortion theory, efficient coding, and Bayesian inference. A theoretical reconciliation of these alternatives has yet to emerge. Here I endeavor to constrain the model space by clarifying which processing paradigms align with natural selection objectives. I find that signal processing and fitness objectives often deviate; for example, in a finite game where risk-avoidant bet-hedging beats maximization of average performance. When these objectives do align, the specific signal processing performance metric that aligns with fitness over the most general set of circumstances is the minimization of utility-weighted signal distortion. Together, these results reveal that selection favors perceptual system adaptations to (at least) three types of noise; environmental, encoding, and decoding; and establish utility-weighted distortion minimization as the optimal adaptation to the second.",

    "abstract": "Despite 50+ years of clinical use as anxiolytics, anti-convulsants, and sedative/hypnotic agents, the mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine (BZD) tolerance are poorly understood. BZDs potentiate the actions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, through positive allosteric modulation of {gamma}2 subunit containing GABA type A receptors (GABAARs). Here we define key molecular events impacting {gamma}2 GABAAR and the inhibitory synapse gephyrin scaffold following initial sustained BZD exposure in vitro and in vivo. Using immunofluorescence and biochemical experiments, we found that cultured cortical neurons treated with the classical BZD, diazepam (DZP), presented no substantial change in surface or synaptic levels of {gamma}2-GABAARs. In contrast, both {gamma}2 and the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin showed diminished total protein levels following a single DZP treatment in vitro and in mouse cortical tissue. We further identified DZP treatment enhanced phosphorylation of gephyrin Ser270 and increased generation of gephyrin cleavage products. Selective immunoprecipitation of {gamma}2 from cultured neurons revealed enhanced ubiquitination of this subunit following DZP exposure. To assess novel trafficking responses induced by DZP, we employed a {gamma}2 subunit containing an N terminal fluorogen-activating peptide (FAP) and pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein ({gamma}2pHFAP). Live-imaging experiments using {gamma}2pHFAP GABAAR expressing neurons identified enhanced lysosomal targeting of surface GABAARs and increased overall accumulation in vesicular compartments in response to DZP. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements between 2 and {gamma}2 subunits within a GABAAR in neurons, we identified reductions in synaptic clusters of this subpopulation of surface BZD sensitive receptor. Moreover, we found DZP simultaneously enhanced synaptic exchange of both {gamma}2-GABAARs and gephyrin using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) techniques. Finally we provide the first proteomic analysis of the BZD sensitive GABAAR interactome in DZP vs. vehicle treated mice. Collectively, our results indicate DZP exposure elicits down-regulation of gephyrin scaffolding and BZD sensitive GABAAR synaptic availability via multiple dynamic trafficking processes.",

Whereas its membrane proximal and cytoplasmic domains have been functionally and structurally characterized, the role of ICA512 N-terminal segment named  regulated endocrine-specific protein 18 homology domain (RESP18HD), which encompasses residues 35-131, remains largely unknown. Here we show that ICA512 RESP18HD residues 91-131 encode for an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which in vitro acts as a condensing factor for the reversible aggregation of insulin and other {beta}-cell proteins in a pH and Zn2+regulated fashion. At variance with what has been shown for other granule cargoes with aggregating properties, the condensing activity of ICA512 RESP18HD is displayed at pH close to neutral, i.e. in the pH range found in the early secretory pathway, while it is resolved at acidic pH and Zn2+ concentrations resembling those present in mature SGs. Moreover, we show that ICA512 RESP18HD residues 35-90, preceding the IDR, inhibit insulin fibrillation in vitro. Finally, we found that glucose-stimulated secretion of RESP18HD upon exocytosis of SGs from insulinoma INS-1 cells is associated with cleavage of its IDR, conceivably to prevent its aggregation upon exposure to neutral pH in the extracellular milieu. Taken together, these findings point to ICA512 RESP18HD being a condensing factor for protein sorting and granulogenesis early in the secretory pathway, and for prevention of amyloidogenesis.",

Here, we utilize a human norovirus replicon in epithelial human gastric tumor (HGT) cells to identify host factors involved in promoting or inhibiting HuNoV replication. We observed that an IFN-cured population of replicon-harboring HGT cells (HGT-cured) was enhanced in their ability to replicate transfected HuNoV RNA compared to parental HGT cells, suggesting that differential gene expression in HGT-cured cells created an environment favouring the replication of viral RNA. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes differentially regulated in HGT-NV and HGT-cured compared to parental HGT cells. We found that the IFN lambda receptor alpha (IFNLR1) expression was highly reduced in HGT-NV and HGT-cured cells. All three cell lines responded to exogenous IFN-{beta} by inducing interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), however, HGT-NV and HGT-cured failed to respond to exogenous IFN-{lambda}. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine partially reactivated IFNLR1 expression in HGT-NV and IFN-cured cells suggesting that host adaptation occurred via epigenetic reprogramming. In line with this observation, ectopic expression of the IFN-{lambda} receptor alpha rescued HGT-NV and HGT-cured cells response to IFN-{lambda}. We conclude that type III IFN is important in inhibiting HuNoV replication in vitro and that the loss of IFNLR1 enhances replication of HuNoV. To the best of our knowledge, this study unravels for the first time epigenetic reprograming of the interferon lambda receptor as a new mechanism of cellular adaptation during long-term RNA virus replication and shows that an endogenous level of interferon lambda signalling is able to control human norovirus replication.",

Conversely, patients with bipolar disorder might smoke more (often) as a result of the psychiatric disorder. Research that investigates causality and the direction of the relationship between smoking and bipolar disorder has been lacking.\\n\\nObjectiveTo investigate the direction and causal nature of the relationship between smoking and bipolar disorder we conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study.\\n\\nData sourcesPublicly available summary statistics from genome-wide association studies on bipolar disorder, smoking initiation, smoking heaviness, smoking cessation and lifetime smoking (i.e., a compound measure of heaviness, duration and cessation). We applied multiple analytical methods with different, orthogonal assumptions to triangulate results, including inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger or Egger SIMEX, weighted median, weighted mode, and Steiger filtered analyses.\\n\\nResultsAcross different methods of MR, consistent evidence was found for a positive effect of smoking on the odds of bipolar disorder (smoking initiation ORIVW=1.46, 95% CI=1.28-1.66, P=1.44x10-8, lifetime smoking ORIVW=1.72, 95% CI=1.29-2.28, P=1.8x10-4). The MR analyses of the liability of bipolar disorder on smoking provided no clear evidence of a strong causal effect (smoking initiation betaIVW= -0.008, 95% CI= -0.026-0.009, P=0.35; P=0.94; smoking heaviness betaIVW=0.028, 95% CI= 0.003-0.053, P=2.9x10-2; smoking cessation ORIVW= 0.997, 95% CI= 0.981-1.014, P=0.74; lifetime smoking betaIVW= -0.001, 95%CI=-0.022-0.020, P=0.95).\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that smoking initiation and lifetime smoking are likely to be a causal risk factor for developing bipolar disorder. We found some evidence that liability to smoking increased smoking heaviness. Given that smoking is a modifiable risk factor, these findings further support investment into smoking prevention and treatment in order to reduce mental health problems in future generations.",

Although evidence exists that in some cases selection favors more stable RNA secondary structures, we currently lack a concrete idea of how many genes are affected within a species, and if this is a universal phenomenon in nature.\n\nWe searched for signs of structural selection in a global manner, analyzing a set of one million coding sequences from 73 species representing all domains of life, as well as viruses, by means of our newly developed software PACKEIS. We show that codon composition and amino acid identity are main determinants of RNA secondary structure. In addition, we show that the arrangement of synonymous codons within coding sequences is non-random, yielding extremely high, but also extremely low secondary structures significantly more often than expected by chance.\n\nTogether, we demonstrate that selection for high and low secondary structure is a widespread phenomenon. Our results provide another line of evidence that synonymous mutations are less neutral than commonly thought, which is of importance for many evolutionary models.",

    "abstract": "During disease, cells experience various stresses that manifest as an accumulation of misfolded proteins and eventually lead to cell death. To combat this stress, cells activate a pathway called UPR (Unfolded Protein Response) that functions to maintain ER (endoplasmic reticulum) homeostasis and determines cell fate. We recently reported a hitherto unknown mechanism of regulating ER stress via a novel post-translational modification (PTM) called Fic-mediated Adenylylation/AMPylation. Specifically, we showed that the human Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) protein, HYPE/FicD, catalyzes the addition of an AMP (adenosine monophosphate) to the ER chaperone, BiP, to alter the cells UPR-mediated response to misfolded proteins. Here, we report that we have now identified a second target for HYPE - alpha-Synuclein (Syn), a presynaptic protein involved in Parkinsons disease (PD). Aggregated Syn has been shown to induce ER stress and elicit neurotoxicity in PD models. We show that HYPE adenylylates Syn and reduces phenotypes associated with Syn aggregation in vitro, suggesting a possible mechanism by which cells cope with Syn toxicity.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIAggregated forms of the presynaptic protein Syn cause neurotoxicity and induce ER stress in cellular and animal models of Parkinsons disease.\\nC_LIO_LIWe have identified Syn as a novel target for the human Fic protein, HYPE, a key regulator of ER homeostasis.\\nC_LIO_LIHYPE adenylylates Syn and reduces the aggregation of recombinant Syn\\nC_LIO_LIFic-mediated adenylylation/AMPylation is a possible mechanism by which cells cope with Syn toxicity.\\nC_LI\\n\\nGraphic Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Human telomerase functions in maintaining genome stability by adding telomeric repeats to the termini of linear chromosomes. Past studies have revealed profound insights into telomerase functions. However, low abundance of functional telomerase and difficulty in quantifying its activity leave partially characterized its thermodynamic and kinetic properties. Using a newly developed method to count individual extension products, we demonstrate that human telomerase holoenzymes contain fast- and slow-acting catalytic sites. Surprisingly, both active sites become inactive after two consecutive rounds of catalysis. The fast active sites turn off ~40-fold quicker than the slow ones and exhibit higher affinity to substrates. In dimeric enzymes, the two sites work in tandem with the faster site functioning before the slower one. In monomeric enzymes, the active sites also perform single-run catalysis. Interestingly, the inactive enzymes can be reactivated by intracellular telomerase-activating factors (iTAFs) available in multiple cell types. Together, the single-run catalysis and the iTAF-triggered reactivation serve as a novel control circuit to ensure that the telomerase holoenzymes are dynamically controlled to match their number of active sites with the number of telomeres they extend. Such exquisite kinetic control of telomerase activity is expected to play important roles in cell division and ageing.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian DNA replication is initiated at numerous replication origins, which are clustered into thousands of replication domains (RDs) across the genome. However, it remains unclear whether the replication origins within each RD are activated stochastically. To understand how replication is regulated at the sub-RD level, we directly visualized the spatio-temporal organization, morphology, and in situ epigenetic signatures of individual replication foci (RFi) across S-phase using super-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Importantly, we revealed a hierarchical radial pattern of RFi propagation that reverses its directionality from early to late S-phase, and is diminished upon caffeine treatment or CTCF knockdown. Together with simulation and bioinformatic analyses, our findings point to a  CTCF-organized REplication Propagation (CoREP) model. The CoREP model suggests a non-random selection mechanism for replication activation mediated by CTCF at the sub-RD level, as well as the critical involvement of local chromatin environment in regulating replication in space and time.",

Here we integrated multi-omics profiles, including the transcriptome, transcription factor DNA-binding and chromatin accessibility, in skin keratinocytes isolated from EEC syndrome patients carrying p63 mutations to examine the role of p63 in shaping the chromatin architecture. We found decreased chromatin accessibility in p63- and CTCF-bound open chromatin regions that potentially contributed to gene deregulation in mutant keratinocytes. Cooperation of p63 and CTCF seemed to assist chromatin interactions between p63-bound enhancers and gene promoters in skin keratinocytes.

    "abstract": "Substitution of lysine 27 with methionine in histone H3.3 is a recently discovered driver mutation of pediatric high-grade gliomas. Mutant tumor cells show decreased levels and altered distribution of H3K27me3. How these chromatin changes are established genome-wide and lead to tumorigenesis only in specific tissues remains unclear. Here we show that H3.3K27M-mediated alterations in H3K27me3 distribution result in ectopic DNA replication and cell cycle progression of germ cells in Caenorhabditis elegans. By genetically inducing changes in the H3.3 distribution, we demonstrate that both H3.3K27M oncohistone incorporation and pre-existing H3K27me3 act locally and antagonistically on Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in a concentration-dependent manner, explaining the observed H3K27me3 distribution in mutant cells. The altered heterochromatin patterns lead to extensive misregulation of gene expression. Through unbiased genetic screening, we found that inhibiting JNK pathway components, which are overexpressed in H3.3K27M cells, suppresses the ectopic DNA replication and cell cycle progression without rescuing the altered H3K27me3 distribution. Moreover, we show that JNK inhibition suppresses the replicative fate in human tumor-derived H3.3K27M cells, thus establishing C. elegans as a powerful model for the identification of potential drug targets for treatment of H3.3K27M tumors.",

To facilitate stratification of patients with this disease into similar molecular subtypes, we developed and validated a simple, mutually exclusive classification.\\n\\nMethodsMutational status of EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 was used to define six mutually exclusive molecular subtypes. A development cohort of 283 cytology specimens of lung adenocarcinoma was used to evaluate the associations between the proposed classification and clinicopathologic variables including demographic characteristics, smoking history, fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular results. For validation and prognostic assessment, 63 of the 283 cytology specimens with available survival data were combined with a separate cohort of 428 surgical pathology specimens of lung adenocarcinoma.\\n\\nResultsThe proposed classification yielded significant associations between these molecular subtypes and clinical and prognostic features. We found better overall survival in patients who underwent surgery and had tumors enriched for EGFR mutations. Worse overall survival was associated with older age, stage IV disease, and tumors with comutations in KRAS and TP53. Interestingly, neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy showed benefit to overall survival.\\n\\nConclusionsThe mutational status of EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 can be used to easily classify lung adenocarcinoma patients into six subtypes that show a relationship with prognosis, especially in patients who underwent surgery, and these subtypes are similar to classifications based on more complex genomic methods reported previously.",

However, our current understanding of 3D genome organization does not include PCH domains because of technical challenges associated with repetitive sequences enriched in PCH genomic regions. We investigated the 3D architecture of Drosophila melanogaster PCH domains and their spatial associations with euchromatic genome by developing a novel analysis method that incorporates genome-wide Hi-C reads originating from PCH DNA. Combined with cytogenetic analysis, we reveal a hierarchical organization of the PCH domains into distinct \\\"territories.\\\" Strikingly, H3K9me2/3-enriched regions embedded in the euchromatic genome show prevalent 3D interactions with the PCH domain. These spatial contacts require H3K9me2/3 enrichment, are likely mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation, and may influence organismal fitness. Our findings have important implications for how PCH architecture influences the function and evolution of both repetitive heterochromatin and the gene-rich euchromatin.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe three dimensional (3D) organization of genomes in cell nuclei can influence a wide variety of genome functions. However, most of our understanding of this critical architecture has been limited to the gene-rich euchromatin, and largely ignores the gene-poor and repeat-rich pericentromeric heterochromatin, or PCH. PCH comprises large part of most eukaryotic genomes, forms 3D PCH domains in nuclei, and plays vital role in chromosome dynamics and genome stability. In this study, we developed a new method that overcomes the technical challenges imposed by the highly repetitive PCH DNA, and generated a comprehensive picture of its 3D organization. Combined with image analyses, we revealed a hierarchical organization of the PCH domains. Surprisingly, we showed that distant euchromatic regions enriched for repressive epigenetic marks also dynamically interact with the main PCH domains. These 3D interactions are mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation mechanisms, similar to how oil and vinegar separate in salad dressing, and can influence the fitness of individuals. Our discoveries have strong implications for how seemingly \\\"junk\\\" DNA could impact functions in the gene-rich euchromatin.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization has greatly reduced the extent of high quality habitat available to wildlife with detrimental consequences documented across a range of taxa. Roads and artificial lighting regimes are dominant features of the modern environment, and there is currently a rapid worldwide transition towards energy-efficient, broad-spectrum white-light streetlight technologies such as metal halide (MH) and more recently, light-emitting diode (LED), despite little being known about their broad ecological impacts. Here, in a five-year citizen science study across the island of Jersey, we combine detailed lighting and habitat data with ultrasonic bat survey data collected from 2011 to 2015 (before and after a LED lighting technology transition), to analyse the landscape-scale effects of different broad-spectrum streetlight technologies on activity of a widespread, generalist bat species. In contrast to many experimental studies, we show that the local density of both traditional yellow high-pressure sodium (HPS) and more modern LED streetlights have significant negative effects on activity of the common pipistrelle (Pipistrelluspipistrellus) compared to unlit areas, while accounting for spatial bias, bat population trends over time, surrounding habitat type and road-type. In contrast, we find no discernable impact of the density of ultra-violet emitting MH lighting on bat activity. This is the first large-scale evidence that emerging artificial lighting technologies have differential impacts on activity, even for a bat species generally characterised as light-tolerant and commonly found in urban areas. Importantly, our landscape-level approach also demonstrates that the degree of urbanization and road type have even larger negative impacts on bat activity, independent of artificial lighting regime. Our findings emphasise the need for improving landscape-scale understanding of the ecological impacts of new lighting technologies prior to widespread uptake, and have important implications for future streetlight installation programmes and urban planning more generally.",

The samples of the data may be individual samples or the means - or some overall summary statistic - of independently acquired subsets of data (e.g. data from individual observers, neurons, or baseball games). The various subsets of data acquired that go into computing the t-statistic are likely to be of differing reliability on account of either different variances or of different numbers of subsamples corresponding to each subset; while all data are given equal weight in a standard t-test, the variation in data reliability across subsets of data needs to be accounted for. Solutions based on mixed model methods and Monte Carlo simulations exist, which do factor data reliability in computing statistics. However, no such extension exists for the ubiquitous students t-test. Our proposal is a novel variant of the students t-test that incorporates these issues and adopts a simple but effective alteration in the design that accounts for differing levels of data reliability. Specifically, we weighted each data subset by the inverse of the variance of the data contained therein, a measure that has been used in studies of Bayesian cue combination, or, in the absence of information about variance, by the relative proportion of the overall data contained in the subset.

However, toxic chemotherapy or radiation is necessary to ablate an animals existing blood system prior to HSC transplantation, leading to significant morbidity. To accomplish safer blood-system replacement we developed a combination of six monoclonal antibodies to safely and specifically deplete the HSCs, T cells and NK cells of immune-competent mice. Remarkably, immunologically-foreign (allogeneic) HSCs mismatched at half or all the MHC genes could engraft these antibody-treated mice, generating donor blood systems that stably co-existed with host blood cells. These chimeric immune systems were immunologically tolerant to heart tissue from the HSC donor, providing a safe platform for HSC transplantation as a means to solid organ transplantation. The ability to transplant MHC-mismatched HSCs without chemotherapy or radiation has significant ramifications for regenerative medicine.",

Paradigms based on electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may detect covert consciousness in unresponsive patients but are subject to logistical challenges and the need for advanced statistical analysis.\\n\\nMethodsTo assess the feasibility of automated pupillometry for the detection of command following, we enrolled 20 healthy volunteers and 48 patients with a wide range of neurological disorders, including 7 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), who were asked to engage in mental arithmetic.\\n\\nResultsFourteen of 20 (70%) healthy volunteers and 17 of 43 (39.5%) neurological patients, including 1 in the ICU, fulfilled prespecified criteria for command following by showing pupillary dilations during [&ge;]4 of 5 arithmetic tasks. None of the 5 sedated and unconscious ICU patients passed this threshold.\\n\\nConclusionsAutomated pupillometry combined with mental arithmetic appears to be a promising paradigm for the detection of covert consciousness in people with brain injury. We plan to build on this study by focusing on non-communicating ICU patients in whom the level of consciousness is unknown. If some of these patients show reproducible pupillary dilation during mental arithmetic, this would suggest that the present paradigm can reveal conscious awareness in unresponsive patients in whom standard investigations have failed to detect signs of covert consciousness.",

The diversity center of this species is in the Fertile Crescent and in central Asia and could also be found in many places in Iran. In this experiment, 359 accessions provided by National Plant Gene Bank of Iran (NPGBI) were used. Based on the geographical distribution, the highest distribution of Ae. cylindrica are from North, West and North West regions of Iran. The distribution data of Ae. cylindrica showed that the distribution centers in Iran are more than those reported in previous studies in Iran. Chromosome counting showed that all Ae. cylindrica accessions are tetraploid (2n=4x=28). Results of factor analysis for 9 morphological chromosome traits showed that karyotypic variation within accessions are related to the length of chromosomes and there is difference between accessions for their total chromosome length, but the karyotype of different accessions were almost the same for the symmetry. Low coefficient of variation in morphological traits as well as symmetric karyotypes of Ae. cylindrica species observed in this study could lead us to more confidently say that Ae. cylindrica could be a recently evolved species among remote relatives of bread wheat.",

    "abstract": "A guide RNA (gRNA) directs the function of a CRISPR protein effector to a target gene of choice, providing a versatile programmable platform for engineering diverse modes of synthetic regulation (edit, silence, induce, bind). However, the fact that gRNAs are constitutively active places limitations on the ability to confine gRNA activity to a desired location and time. To achieve programmable control over the scope of gRNA activity, here we apply principles from dynamic RNA nanotechnology to engineer conditional guide RNAs (cgRNAs) whose activity is dependent on the presence or absence of an RNA trigger. These cgRNAs are programmable at two levels, with the trigger-binding sequence controlling the scope of the effector activity and the target-binding sequence determining the subject of the effector activity. We demonstrate molecular mechanisms for both constitutively active cgRNAs that are conditionally inactivated by an RNA trigger (ON[-&gt;]OFF logic) and constitutively inactive cgRNAs that are conditionally activated by an RNA trigger (OFF[-&gt;]ON logic). For each mechanism, automated sequence design is performed using the reaction pathway designer within NUPACK to design an orthogonal library of three cgRNAs that respond to different RNA triggers. In E. coli expressing cgRNAs, triggers, and silencing dCas9 as the protein effector, we observe programmable conditional gene silencing with a median dynamic range of {approx}6-fold for an ON[-&gt;]OFF \\\"terminator switch\\\" mechanism, {approx}15-fold for an ON[-&gt;]OFF \\\"splinted switch\\\" mechanism, and {approx}3.6-fold for an OFF[-&gt;]ON \\\"toehold switch\\\" mechanism; the median crosstalk within each cgRNA library is <2%, <2%, and {approx}20% for the three mechanisms. By providing programmable control over both the scope and target of protein effector function, cgRNA regulators offer a promising platform for synthetic biology.\\n\\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Current single-cell RNA sequencing approaches gives a snapshot of a cellular phenotype but convey no information on the temporal dynamics of transcription. Moreover, the stochastic nature of transcription at molecular level is not recovered. Here, we present single-cell SLAM-seq (scSLAM-seq), which integrates metabolic RNA labeling, biochemical nucleoside conversion and single-cell RNA-seq to directly measure total transcript levels and transcriptional activity by differentiating newly synthesized from pre-existing RNA for thousands of genes per single cell. scSLAM-seq recovers the earliest virus-induced changes in cytomegalovirus infection and reveals a so far hidden phase of viral gene expression comprising promiscuous transcription of all kinetic classes. It depicts the stochastic nature of transcription and demonstrates extensive gene-specific differences. These range from stable transcription rates to on-off dynamics which coincide with gene-/promoter-intrinsic features (Tbp-TATA-box interactions and DNA methylation). Gene but not cell-specific features thus explain the heterogeneity in transcriptomes between individual cells and the transcriptional response to perturbations.",

We determined the theoretical relationship between read depth and expected genotype quality (EGQ) for tetraploid vs. diploidized genotype calls. If the GBS method has 1% error, then 17 reads are needed to classify tetraploid samples as heterozygous vs. homozygous with 95% accuracy, compared with 63 reads to determine allele dosage. We developed an R script to convert tetraploid GBS data in Variant Call Format (VCF) into diploidized genotype calls and applied it to 267 interspecific hybrids of the tetraploid forage grass Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria). When reads were aligned to a mock reference genome created from GBS data of the U. brizantha cultivar  Marandu, 25,678 bi-allelic SNPs were discovered, compared to approximately 3000 SNPs when aligning to the closest true reference genomes, Setaria viridis and S. italica. Crossvalidation revealed that missing genotypes were imputed by the Random Forest method with a median accuracy of 0.85, regardless of heterozygote frequency. Using the Urochloa spp. hybrids, we illustrated how filtering samples based only on GQ creates genotype bias; a depth threshold with corresponding EGQ equal to the GQ threshold is also needed, regardless of whether genotypes are called using a diploidized or allele dosage model.",

    "abstract": "The clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia are clinically and neuropathologically heterogeneous, but processes such as neuroinflammation may be common across the disease spectrum. We investigated how neuroinflammation relates to the aggregation of Tau and TDP-43 in frontotemporal dementia, and to the heterogeneity of clinical disease. We used positron emission tomography in vivo with (a) [11C]PK-11195, a marker of activated microglia and a proxy index of neuroinflammation, and (b) [18F]AV-1451, a radioligand with increased binding to pathologically affected regions in tauopathies and diseases associated with TDP-43 protein aggregation, and which is used as a surrogate marker of non-{beta}-amyloid protein aggregation. We assessed 31 patients with frontotemporal dementia (10 with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 11 with the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia and 10 with the non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia), 28 of whom underwent both [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK-11195 PET, and matched controls (14 for [18F]AV-1451 and 15 for [11C]PK-11195). We used univariate region-of-interest analyses, and multivariate analysis of the distribution of binding that explicitly control for individual differences in ligand affinity for TDP-43 and different Tau isoforms. We found differences between patients and controls in frontotemporal regions for both neuroinflammation and protein aggregation, and a strong positive correlation between these two processes in all disease groups. Despite this regional co-localisation, the multivariate distribution of [11C]PK-11195 binding related better to clinical heterogeneity than did the distribution of [18F]AV-1451: distinct spatial modes of neuroinflammation were associated with different frontotemporal dementia syndromes and supported accurate group classification of participants. These in vivo findings indicate a close association between neuroinflammation and protein aggregation in frontotemporal dementia. The inflammatory component may be important in shaping the clinical and neuropathological patterns of the diverse clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia.",

K means cluster modelling for longitudinal data (kml3d) was used to identify distinct, homogeneous clusters of functional outcome trajectories. Patients with at least 3 assessments were included in the trajectory analyses (N=129).

In the current study, we explored whether a similar interaction could be observed between adjacent, contralateral and remote muscles. Indeed, widespread muscle pain-hypersensitivity is a hallmark of chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia.\\n\\nMethods5% HS was infused into the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscle to develop a stable baseline pain (n=30). In separate experiments, each of the three test locations (n=10 per site), the adjacent abductor digiti minimi (ADM), contralateral FCU and contralateral tibialis anterior (TA) (part 1-3, respectively), 50L of 0.9% normal saline (NS) was infused (in triplicate) prior to, during and following HS-induced muscle pain.\\n\\nResultsUnder control conditions (no background pain), the infusion of NS was imperceptible by all subjects. In the presence of HS-induced background pain (FCU), in part 1 the NS co-infusion into ADM increased overall pain by 17%. This was replicated in the contralateral FCU (part 2) with a 12% pain increase, and in the TA (part 3) with a 15% pain increase in response to the NS co-infusions. Notably, over 80% of subjects perceived the NS-induced increase in pain at the HS-infusion location (FCU) rather than the NS-infusion location (adjacent, contralateral and remote).\\n\\nConclusionsIntramuscular infusion of HS results in pain-hypersensitivity to sub-perceptual stimulation of muscle afferents in a somatotopically unrestricted manner, indicating the involvement of a central (likely supra-spinal) mechanism.\\n\\nSignificanceThis work provides evidence for a regionally diffuse type of pain hypersensitivity, manifesting as a painful response to normally sub-perceptual stimulation in the context of acute experimentally induced muscle pain.

Although depletion of raft component glycoshpingolipids causes abnormality particularly in ectoderm layer formation, it remains unclear whether rafts play a role in lineage determination, a critical but less-known stage in lineage commitment. Here, inducing mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation with retinoic acid (RA), we observed lipid rafts increased since early stage, especially in ectoderm-like cells. Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy characterized at super-resolution the distinct raft features in mESCs and the derived differentiated cells. Furthermore, RA-induced commitment of ectoderm-like cells was significantly diminished not only by genetic ablation of rafts but by applying inhibitor for glycosphingolipids or cholesterol at early differentiation stages. Meanwhile, raft inhibition delayed RA-induced pluripotency exit, an early step required for differentiation. Therefore, lipid rafts increase and facilitate ectoderm lineage specification as well as pluripotency exit during mESC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial bones. The goal of this study was to determine if delivery of recombinant tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) could prevent or diminish the severity of craniosynostosis in a C57BL/6 FGFR2C342Y/+ model of neonatal onset craniosynostosis or a BALB/c FGFR2C342Y/+ model of postnatal onset craniosynostosis. Mice were injected with a lentivirus encoding a mineral targeted form of TNAP immediately after birth. Cranial bone fusion as well as cranial bone volume, mineral content and density were assessed by micro computed tomography. Craniofacial shape was measured with calipers. Alkaline phosphatase, alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) activity levels were measured in serum. Neonatal delivery of TNAP diminished craniosynostosis severity from 94% suture obliteration in vehicle treated mice to 67% suture obliteration in treated mice, p<0.02) and the incidence of malocclusion from 82.4% to 34.7% (p<0.03), with no effect on cranial bone in C57BL/6 FGFR2C342Y/+ mice. In contrast, treatment with TNAP improved cranial bone volume (p< 0.01), density (p< 0.01) and mineral content (p< 0.01) but had no effect on craniosynostosis or malocclusion in BALB/c FGFR2C342Y/+ mice. These results indicate that perinatal recombinant TNAP enzyme therapy diminishes craniosynostosis severity in the C57BL/6 FGFR2C342Y/+ neonatal onset mouse model of Crouzon syndrome, and that effects of exogenous TNAP are genetic background dependent.",

    "abstract": "In several sawfly taxa strong mitonuclear discordance has been observed, with nuclear genes supporting species assignments based on morphology, whereas the barcode region of the mitochondrial COI gene suggesting different relationships. As previous studies were based on only few nuclear genes, the causes and the degree of mitonuclear discordance remain ambiguous. Here, we obtain genomic-scale ddRAD data together with Sanger sequencing of mitochondrial COI and two to three nuclear protein coding genes to investigate species limits and mitonuclear discordance in two closely related species groups within the sawfly genus Empria. As found previously based on nuclear ITS and mitochondrial COI sequences, species are in most cases supported as monophyletic based on previous and new nuclear data reported here, but not based on mitochondrial COI. This mitonuclear discordance can be explained by occasional mitochondrial introgression with little or no nuclear gene flow, a pattern that might be common in haplodiploid taxa with slowly evolving mitochondrial genomes. Some species in E. immersa group are not recovered as monophyletic also based on nuclear data, but this could partly be because of unresolved taxonomy. Preliminary analyses of ddRAD data did not recover monophyly of E. japonica within E. longicornis group (three Sanger sequenced nuclear genes strongly supported monophyly), but closer examination of the data and additional Sanger sequencing suggested that both specimens were substantially (possibly 10-20% of recovered loci) cross-contaminated. A reason could be due to specimen identification tag jumps during sequencing library preparation of pooled specimens that in previous studies have been shown to affect up to 2.5% of the sequenced reads. We provide an R script to examine patterns of identical loci among the specimens and estimate that cross-contamination rate is not unusually high for our ddRAD dataset as a whole (based on counting identical sequences between immersa and longicornis groups that are well separated from each other and probably do not hybridise). The high rate of cross-contamination for both E. japonica specimens might be explained by small number of recovered loci (~1000) compared to most other specimens (>10 000 in some cases) because of poor sequencing results. We caution drawing unexpected biological conclusions when closely related specimens are pooled before sequencing and tagged only at one end of the molecule or at both ends using unique combination of limited number of tags (less than the number of specimens).",

    "abstract": "Background women with diabetes are at increased risk of sexual problems, however, this problem is under reported hence the need for this study. Methods This was a cross sectional case-controlled study. Seventy-five consenting females with type 2 DM were enrolled from the Diabetes Clinic of the Federal Medical Center, Umuahia, while Seventy-five persons which included hospital workers and female companions of subjects were recruited as control. Sexual dysfunction in both groups was diagnosed and characterized using the female sexual function index (FSFI). Data obtained from this study was presented as Mean{+/-}SD and analyzed using SPSS 17 software. Results The mean age of the T2DM group and control were 44.5 years and 38.9 years respectively. The mean total female sexual score (TFSS) was 22.10{+/-}6.66 in the T2DM subjects, while in the control subjects, it was 22.43{+/-}5.29. This was not statistically significant. The FSF scores in the desire, lubrication and orgasm domains were all lower in the diabetic women and this was statistically significant (P< 0.05). The domains of pain and arousal were also lower in the diabetic women although this was not statistically significant (P >0.05). The proportion of diabetic females who reported problems in the arousal, lubrication, orgasm and pain domains were higher (40.0, 36.4, 32.7, 29.1) than the controls (27.9, 16.2, 14.7, 19.1) {p<0.05}. Conclusion The prevalence of female sexual dysfunction was high from our study. Similarly, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score was low in women with diabetes when compared with controls. The domains of arousal, pain, orgasm and satisfaction were the most affected domains in subjects with DM Age, marital status, BMI, FBS and hypertension were predictive of sexual dysfunction in the diabetic women.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial surface attachment is mediated by rotary flagella and filamentous appendages called pili. Here, we describe the role of Tad pili during surface colonization of Caulobacter crescentus. Using an optical trap and microfluidic controlled flow conditions as a mimic of natural environments, we demonstrate that Tad pili undergo repeated cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds after establishing surface contact, pili reorient cells into an upright position promoting walking-like movements against the medium flow. Pili-mediated positioning of the flagellated pole close to the surface facilitates motor-mediated mechanical sensing and promotes anchoring of the holdfast, an adhesive substance that affords long-term attachment. We present evidence that the second messenger c-di-GMP regulates pili dynamics during surface encounter in distinct ways, promoting increased activity at intermediate levels and retraction of pili at peak concentrations. We propose a model, in which flagellum and Tad pili functionally interact and together impose a ratchet-like mechanism that progressively drives C. crescentus cells towards permanent surface attachment.",

The small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and intergenic spacers (IGS) of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were cloned from the strain and sequenced. By means of multiple sequence alignment, we found that the three gene regions had different levels of polymorphism. There was greater polymorphism in ITS (74 variable sites) and IGS (55.59%) regions than in the SSU rDNA (17 variable sites). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Kimura 2-parameter with neighbor joining and the results showed that LEP9557 had a close relationship with Nosema bombycis. Sequences of each clone were submitted to Genbank (Accession number: MF150254-MF150258). All of the results indicated the presence of genetic diversity in LEP9557, which established the foundation for identifying the phylogeny and relationships with other microsporidian strains, and had significant biological meaning for maintaining the survival and population continuity of the strain.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning can bias decision-making towards the option with the highest expected outcome. Cognitive learning theories associate this bias with the constant tracking of stimulus values and the evaluation of choice outcomes in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Decisions however first require processing of sensory input, and to-date, we know far less about the interplay between learning and perception. This fMRI study (N=43), relates visual BOLD responses to value-beliefs during choice, and, signed prediction errors after outcomes. To understand these relationships, which co-occurred in the striatum, we sought relevance by evaluating the prediction of future value-based decisions in a separate transfer phase where learning was already established. We decoded choice outcomes with a 70% accuracy with a supervised machine learning algorithm that was given trial-by-trial BOLD from visual regions alongside more traditional motor, prefrontal, and striatal regions. Importantly, this decoding of future value-driven choice outcomes again highligted an important role for visual activity. These results raise the intriguing possibility that the tracking of value in visual cortex is supportive for the striatal bias towards the more valued option in future choice.",

    "abstract": "The medial thalamus (MThal), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum play important roles in affective-motivational pain processing and reward learning. Opioids affect both pain and reward through uncharacterized modulation of this circuitry. This study examined opioid actions on glutamate transmission between these brain regions in mouse. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists potently inhibited MThal inputs without affecting ACC inputs to individual striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). MOR activation also inhibited MThal inputs to the pyramidal neurons in the ACC. In contrast, delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonists disinhibited ACC pyramidal neuron responses to MThal inputs by suppressing local feed-forward GABA signaling from parvalbumin-positive interneurons. As a result, DOR activation in the ACC facilitated poly-synaptic (thalamo-cortico-striatal) excitation of MSNs by MThal inputs. These results suggest that opioid effects on pain and reward may be shaped by the relative selectivity of opioid drugs to the specific circuit components.",

    "abstract": "Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are pathological voltage oscillations in cardiomyocytes that have been observed in response to a number of pharmacological agents and disease conditions. Phase-2 EADs consist of small voltage fluctuations that occur during the plateau of an action potential, typically under conditions in which the action potential is elongated. Although a single-cell behavior, EADs can lead to tissue-level arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. Much is currently known about the biophysical mechanisms (i.e., the roles of ion channels and intracellular Ca2+ stores) for the various forms of EADs, due partially to the development and analysis of mathematical models. This includes the application of slow/fast analysis, which takes advantage of timescale separation inherent in the system to simplify its analysis. We take this further, using a minimal 3D model to demonstrate that the phase-2 EADs are canards that are formed in the neighborhood of a folded node singularity. This knowledge allows us to determine the number of EADs that can be produced for a given parameter set without performing computer simulations, and provides guidance on parameter changes that can facilitate or inhibit EAD production. With this approach, we demonstrate why periodic stimulation, as would occur in an intact heart, preferentially facilitates EAD production when applied at low frequencies. We also explain the origin of complex alternan dynamics that can occur with intermediate-frequency stimulation, in which varying numbers of EADs are produced with each stimulation. These revelations fall out naturally from an understanding of folded node singularities, but are hard or impossible to glean from a knowledge of the biophysical mechanism for EADs alone. Therefore, an understanding of the canard mechanism is a useful complement to an understanding of the biophysical mechanism that has been developed over years of experimental and computational investigations.",

This occurs in low-dose radiation as well as doses within hypofractionated range usually used in radiotherapy.

In this study, we analyzed transcriptome data available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database related to B cells isolated from whole blood of 95 donors and then irradiated with 10 Gy. The aim of this study is to investigate the regulation of genes and pathways of the immune system considering the B7-CD28/CTLA4 superfamily, CD40-CD40LG molecules, and cytokines expressed by B cells irradiated. The connection between genes and pathways is established by the Reactome database. Relative activity and diversity of pathways were calculated to determine the modulation of the immune system response to irradiation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures and Bonferronis method were used to determine differentially expressed genes. It was observed that IR up-modulates the response of pathways and genes considered in this study, which indicates that 10 Gy can enhance antitumor immune responses.",

Although, advances in genome-wide technologies have enabled the discovery of hundreds of genes associated with blood lipid phenotypes, most of the heritability remains unexplained. Here we performed targeted resequencing of 13 bona fide candidate genes of dyslipidemia to identify the underlying biological functions. We sequenced 940 Sikh subjects with extreme serum levels of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and 2,355 subjects were used for replication studies; all 3,295 participants were part of the Asian Indians Diabetic Heart Study. Gene-centric analysis revealed a burden of variants for increasing HTG risk in GCKR (p=2.1x10-5), LPL (p=1.6x10-3) and MLXIPL (p=1.6x10-2) genes. Of these, three missense and damaging variants within GCKR were further examined for functional consequences in vivo using a transgenic zebrafish model. All three mutations were South Asian population-specific and were largely absent in other multiethnic populations of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. We built different transgenic models of human GCKR with and without mutations and analyzed the effects of dietary changes in vivo. Despite the short-term feeding, profound phenotypic changes were apparent in hepatocyte histology and fat deposition associated with increased expression of GCKR in response to a high fat diet (HFD). Liver histology of the GCKRmut showed severe fatty metamorphosis which correlated with ~7 fold increase in the mRNA expression in the GCKRmut fish even in the absence of a high fat diet. These findings suggest that functionally disruptive GCKR variants not only increase the risk of HTG but may enhance ectopic lipid/fat storage defects in the absence of obesity and HFD. To our knowledge, this is the first transgenic zebrafish model of a putative human disease gene built to accurately assess the influence of rare genetic changes and their phenotypic consequences in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis and trauma are frequent and challenging health problems in critical care. The diversity of patient response to these conditions complicates both disease management and outcome prediction. Whole blood transcriptomics allows the analysis of response in the critically ill at a molecular level. Prior results in this field demonstrate robust and diverse genomic response in the acute phase and others have shown shared biological mechanisms across wide disease aetiologies. We hypothesize that specific biological mechanisms, particularly those related to immune processes, are shared between sepsis and trauma cohorts. These may serve as universal markers for patients vulnerable to a complicated clinical course and/or mortality. We present a systems level analysis of gene expression for a total of 317 patients with abdominal sepsis (51), pulmonary sepsis (108) or trauma (158) and compare them to healthy controls (68). Our results confirm that immune processes are shared across disease aetiologies in critical illnesses. We identify two consistent and distinct subgroups of critical illness: 1) increased dendritic cell and CD4 T helper fractions but suppressed neutrophils and 2) high neutrophils and otherwise suppressed leukocyte fractions. These subgroups validate in an independent cohort of 181 paediatric patients suffering from septic shock of diverse aetiologies. Furthermore, we found immune and inflammatory processes derived from gene co-expression networks were downregulated in subgroup 1. This paralleled prior results which find similar leukocyte configuration by deconvolving whole blood transcriptomics, and this leukocyte configuration associates with greater susceptibility to multi organ failure. We are the first to identify a patient subgroup with a preserved leukocyte configuration across aetiologies of critical illness, which may serve as a universal predictor of complicated clinical course/poor outcome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReptile-associated Salmonella are a major, but often neglected cause of both gastrointestinal and bloodstream infection globally. The diversity of Salmonella enterica has not yet been determined in venomous snakes, however other cold-blooded animals have been reported to carry a broad range of Salmonella bacteria. We investigated the prevalence and assortment of Salmonella in a collection of venomous snakes in comparison with non-venomous reptiles.\\n\\nMethodology/Principle FindingsWe used a combination of selective enrichment techniques and whole-genome sequencing. We established a unique dataset of reptilian isolates to study Salmonella enterica species-level evolution and ecology and investigated differences between phylogenetic groups. We observed that 91% of venomous snakes carried Salmonella, and found substantial diversity between the serovars (n=58) carried by reptiles. The Salmonella serovars belonged to four of the six Salmonella enterica subspecies: diarizonae, enterica, houtanae and salamae. Subspecies enterica isolates were distributed among two distinct phylogenetic clusters, previously described as clade A (52%) and clade B (48%). We identified metabolic differences between S. diarizonae, S. enterica clade A and clade B involving growth on lactose, tartaric acid, dulcitol, myo-inositol and allantoin.\\n\\nSignificanceWe present the first whole genome-based comparative study of the Salmonella bacteria that colonise venomous and non-venomous reptiles and shed new light on Salmonella evolution. The findings raise the possibility that venomous snakes are a reservoir for human Salmonellosis in Africa. The proximity of venomous snakes to human dwellings in rural Africa may result in contaminated faecal matter being shed on surfaces and in water sources used for human homes and to irrigate salad crops. Because most of the venomous snakes had been captured in Africa, we conclude that the high level of Salmonella diversity reflects the African environmental niches where the snakes have inhabited.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySalmonella enterica is a remarkable bacterial species that causes Neglected Tropical Diseases globally. The burden of disease is greatest in some of the most poverty-afflicted regions of Africa, where salmonellosis frequently causes bloodstream infection with fatal consequences. The bacteria have the ability to colonise the gastrointestinal tract of a wide range of animals including reptiles. Direct or indirect contact between reptiles and humans can cause Salmonellosis. In this study, we determined the prevalence and diversity of Salmonella in a collection of African venomous snakes for the first time. Using the power of genomics, we showed that the majority of venomous snakes (91%) carry Salmonella, two thirds of which belonged to a subspecies of S. enterica called enterica, which is associated with most cases of human salmonellosis. Within the S. enterica subspecies we identified two evolutionary groups which display distinct growth patterns on infection relevant carbon sources. Our findings could have particular significance in Africa where venomous snakes wander freely around human dwellings and potentially shed contaminated faecal matter in water sources and on surfaces in rural homes.",

Despite rapid and widespread growth of this approach, at present we lack neuroimaging processing pipelines suited to address the unique challenges inherent in this data type. Here, we solve the most challenging processing step, rapid and accurate isolation of the fetal brain from surrounding tissue across thousands of non-stationary 3D brain volumes. Leveraging our library of 1,241 manually traced fetal fMRI images from 207 fetuses (gestational age 24-39 weeks, M=30.9, SD=4.2), we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieved excellent performance across two held-out test sets from separate scanners and populations. Furthermore, we unite the auto-masking model with additional fMRI preprocessing steps from existing software and provide insight into our adaptation of each step. This work represents an initial advancement towards a fully comprehensive, open source workflow for fetal functional MRI data preprocessing.",

    "abstract": "The improvement of crop productivity under abiotic stress is one of the biggest challenges faced by the agricultural scientific community. Despite extensive research, the research-to-commercial transfer rate of abiotic stress-resistant crops remains very low. This is mainly due to the complexity of genotype{square}x{square}environment interactions and in particular, the ability to quantify the dynamic plant physiological response profile to a dynamic environment.\\n\\nMost existing phenotyping facilities collect information using robotics and automated image acquisition and analysis. However, their ability to directly measure the physiological properties of the whole plant is limited. We demonstrate a high-throughput functional phenotyping system (HFPS) that enables comparing plants dynamic responses to different ambient conditions in dynamic environments due to its direct and simultaneous measurement of yield-related physiological traits of plants under several treatments. The system is designed as one-to-one (1:1) plant-[sensors+controller] units, i.e., each individual plant has its own personalized sensor, controller and irrigation valves that enable (i) monitoring water-relation kinetics of each plant-environment response throughout the plants life cycle with high spatiotemporal resolution, (ii) a truly randomized experimental design due to multiple independent treatment scenarios for every plant, and (iii) reduction of artificial ambient perturbations due to the immobility of the plants or other objects. In addition, we propose two new resilience-quantifying-related traits that can also be phenotyped using the HFPS: transpiration recovery rate and night water reabsorption.\\n\\nWe use the HFPS to screen the effects of two commercial biostimulants (a seaweed extract--ICL-SW, and a metabolite formula--ICL-NewFo1) on Capsicum annuum under different irrigation regimes. Biostimulants are considered an alternative approach to improving crop productivity. However, their complex mode of action necessitates cost-effective pre-field phenotyping. The combination of two types of treatment (biostimulants and drought) enabled us to evaluate the precision and resolution of the system in investigating the effect of biostimulants on drought tolerance. We analyze and discuss plant behavior at different stages, and assess the penalty and trade-off between productivity and survivability. In this test case, we suggest a protocol for the screening of biostimulants physiological mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "One of the most challenging tasks of the post-genome-wide association studies (GWAS) research era is the identification of functional variants among those associated with a trait for an observed GWAS signal. Several methods have been developed to evaluate the potential functional implications of genetic variants. Each of these tools has its own scoring system which forces users to become acquainted with each approach to interpret their results. From an awareness of the amount of work needed to analyze and integrate results for a single locus, we proposed a flexible and versatile approach designed to help the prioritization of variants by aggregating the predictions of their potential functional implications. This approach has been made available through a web interface called DSNetwork which acts as a single-point of entry to almost 60 reference predictors for both coding and non-coding variants and displays predictions in an easy-to-interpret visualization. We confirmed the usefulness of our methodology by successfully identifying functional variants in four breast cancer susceptibility loci. DSNetwork is an integrative web application implemented through the Shiny framework and available at: http://romix.genome.ulaval.ca/dsnetwork.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOver the past years, GWAS have enabled the identification of numerous susceptibility loci associated with complex traits (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). However, many of those signals contain hundreds or even thousands of significantly associated variants among which only a few are really responsible of the phenotype. Substantial efforts have been made in the development of prediction methods to prioritize variants within GWAS-associated regions to go from statistical associations, to the identification of functional variants modulating gene expression, in order to ultimately gain insight into disease pathophysiology. Unfortunately, these numerous prediction tools generate contradictory predictions rendering the interpretation of results challenging. Some tools such as VEP [McLaren et al., 2016] report their scores using a color scheme, thus acknowledging the need to assist the user in the interpretation of predictor results. Nonetheless, the multiplication of approaches can often result in an extensive amount of data that is hard to synthesize. Aware of the challenge of evaluating the potential deleteriousness of variants in the context of fine mapping analyses, we created a customizable visualization approach that was implemented it in the decision support tool called DSNetwork for Decision Support Network. This tool enables quick access to gold standard and new predictors for both coding and non-coding variants through an easily interpretable visualization of these predictions for a set of variants.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing-based studies have identified novel risk genes for rare, severe epilepsies and revealed a role of rare deleterious variation in common epilepsies. To identify the shared and distinct ultra-rare genetic risk factors for rare and common epilepsies, we performed a whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis of 9,170 epilepsy-affected individuals and 8,364 controls of European ancestry. We focused on three phenotypic groups; the rare but severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE), and the commoner phenotypes of genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) and non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE). We observed that compared to controls, individuals with any type of epilepsy carried an excess of ultra-rare, deleterious variants in constrained genes and in genes previously associated with epilepsy, with the strongest enrichment seen in DEE and the least in NAFE. Moreover, we found that inhibitory GABAA receptor genes were enriched for missense variants across all three classes of epilepsy, while no enrichment was seen in excitatory receptor genes. The larger gene groups for the GABAergic pathway or cation channels also showed a significant mutational burden in DEE and GGE. Although no single gene surpassed exome-wide significance among individuals with GGE or NAFE, highly constrained genes and genes encoding ion channels were among the top associations, including CACNA1G, EEF1A2, and GABRG2 for GGE and LGI1, TRIM3, and GABRG2 for NAFE. Our study confirms a convergence in the genetics of common and rare epilepsies associated with ultra-rare coding variation and highlights a ubiquitous role for GABAergic inhibition in epilepsy etiology in the largest epilepsy WES study to date.",

Both mutations accelerate age-dependent changes in hypoxia-sensitive gene expression supporting that ageing is necessary, but insufficient, for AD occurrence. Curiously, the responses to acute hypoxia become inverted in extremely aged fish. This is associated with an apparent inability to upregulate glycolysis. Wild type PSEN1 allele expression is reduced in post-mortem brains of human EOfAD mutation carriers (and extremely aged fish), possibly contributing to EOfAD pathogenesis.

    "abstract": "Cells interacting through an extracellular matrix (ECM) exhibit emergent behaviors resulting from collective intercellular interaction. In wound healing and tissue development, characteristic compaction of ECM gel is induced by multiple cells that generate tensions in the ECM fibers and coordinate their actions with other cells. Computational prediction of collective cell-ECM interaction based on first principles is highly complex especially as the number of cells increase. Here, we introduce a computationally-efficient method for predicting nonlinear behaviors of multiple cells interacting mechanically through a 3-D ECM fiber network. The key enabling technique is superposition of single cell computational models to predict multicellular behaviors. While cell-ECM interactions are highly nonlinear, they can be linearized accurately with a unique method, termed Dual-Faceted Linearization. This method recasts the original nonlinear dynamics in an augmented space where the system behaves more linearly. The independent state variables are augmented by combining auxiliary variables that inform nonlinear elements involved in the system. This computational method involves a) expressing the original nonlinear state equations with two sets of linear dynamic equations b) reducing the order of the augmented linear system via principal component analysis and c) superposing individual single cell-ECM dynamics to predict collective behaviors of multiple cells. The method is computationally efficient compared to original nonlinear dynamic simulation and accurate compared to traditional Taylor expansion linearization. Furthermore, we reproduce reported experimental results of multi-cell induced ECM compaction.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCollective behaviors of multiple cells interacting through an ECM are prohibitively complex to predict with a mechanistic computational model due to its highly nonlinear dynamics and high dimensional space. We introduce a methodology where nonlinear dynamics of single cells are superposed to predict collective multi-cellular behaviors through a developed linearization method. We represent nonlinear single cell dynamics with linear state equations by augmenting the independent state variables with a set of auxiliary variables. We then transform the linear augmented state equations to a low-dimensional latent model and superpose the linear latent models of individual cells to predict collective behaviors that emerge from multi-cellular interactions. The method successfully reproduced experimental results of cell-induced ECM compaction.",

Although several studies have demonstrated the significance of the SA and synaptopodin in calcium homeostasis and plasticity of dendritic spines, it is still unclear what factors contribute to its stability at the synapse and whether the SA is locally formed or it is actively delivered to the spines. In this study we show that synaptopodin clusters are stable at their locations. We found no evidence of active microtubule-based transport for synaptopodin. Instead new clusters were emerging in the spines, which we interpret as the SA being assembled on-site. Furthermore, using super-resolution microscopy we show a tight association of synaptopodin with actin filaments. We identify the actin-based motor proteins myosin V and VI as novel interaction partners of synaptopodin and demonstrate that myosin V is important for the formation and/or maintenance of the SA.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have innate abilities to resist even the harshest of therapies. To eradicate CSCs, parallels can be drawn from signalling modules that orchestrate pluripotency. Notch-Hedgehog hyperactivation are seen in CSCs, yet, not much is known about their conserved roles in tumour progression across cancers. Methods: Employing a comparative approach involving 21 cancers, we uncovered clinically-relevant, pan-cancer drivers of Notch and Hedgehog. GISTIC datasets were used to evaluate copy number alterations. Receiver operating characteristic and Cox regression were employed for survival analyses. Results: We identified a Notch-Hedgehog signature of 13 genes exhibiting high frequencies of somatic amplifications leading to transcript overexpression. The signature successfully predicted patients at risk of death in five cancers(n=2,278): glioma(P<0.0001), clear cell renal cell(P=0.0022), papillary renal cell(P=0.00099), liver(P=0.014) and stomach(P=0.011). The signature was independent of other clinicopathological parameters and offered additional resolution to stratify similarly-staged tumours. High-risk patients exhibited features of stemness and had more hypoxic tumours, suggesting that hypoxia may influence CSC behaviour. Notch-Hedgehog+ CSCs had an immune privileged phenotype associated with increased regulatory T cell function. Conclusion: This study will set the stage for exploring adjuvant therapy targeting the Notch-Hedgehog axis to help optimise therapeutic regimes leading to successful CSC elimination.",

    "abstract": "The most mineralized tissue of the mammalian body is tooth enamel. Especially in species with thick enamel, three-dimensional (3D) tomography data has shown that the distribution of enamel varies across the occlusal surface of the tooth crown. Differences in enamel thickness among species and within the tooth crown have been used to examine taxonomic affiliations, life history, and functional properties of teeth. Before becoming fully mineralized, enamel matrix is secreted on the top of a dentine template, and it remains to be explored how matrix thickness is spatially regulated. To provide a predictive framework to examine enamel distribution, we introduce a computational model of enamel matrix secretion that maps the dentine topography to the enamel surface topography. Starting from empirical enamel-dentine junctions, enamel matrix deposition is modeled as a diffusion-limited free boundary problem. Using laboratory microCT and synchrotron tomographic data of pig molars that have markedly different dentine and enamel surface topographies, we show how diffusion-limited matrix deposition accounts for both the process of matrix secretion and the final enamel distribution. Simulations reveal how concave and convex dentine features have distinct effects on enamel surface, thereby explaining why the enamel surface is not a straightforward extrapolation of the dentine template. Human molar simulations show that even subtle variation in dentine topography can be mapped to the enamel surface features. Mechanistic models of extracellular matrix deposition can be used to predict occlusal morphologies of teeth.",

    "abstract": "Premature ovarian failure and infertility are adverse effects of cancer therapies. The mechanism underlying chemotherapy-mediated depletion of the ovarian reserve remains unclear. Here, we aim to identify the signaling pathways involved in the loss of the ovarian reserve to prevent the damaging effects of chemotherapy. We evaluated the effects of cyclophosphamide, one of the most damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, against follicle reserve. In vivo studies showed that the cyclophosphamide-induced loss of ovarian reserve occurred through a sequential mechanism. Cyclophosphamide exposure induced the activation of both DNAPK-{gamma}H2AX-checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2)-p53/TAp63 isoform and protein kinase B (AKT)-forkhead box O3 (FOXO3a) signaling axes in the nucleus of oocytes. Concomitant administration of an allosteric ABL inhibitor and cyclophosphamide modulated both pathways while protecting the ovarian reserve from chemotherapy assaults. As a consequence, the fertility of the treated mice was prolonged. On the contrary, the administration of an allosteric ABL activator enhanced the lethal effects of cyclophosphamide while shortening mouse fertility. Therefore, kinase-independent inhibition may serve as an effective ovarian-protective strategy in women under chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Mucormycosis - an emergent, deadly fungal infection - is difficult to treat, in part because the causative species demonstrate broad clinical antifungal resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in these infections remain poorly understood. Our previous work demonstrated that one major agent of mucormycosis, Mucor circinelloides, can develop resistance to the antifungal agents FK506 and rapamycin through a novel, transient RNA interference-dependent mechanism known as epimutation. Epimutations silence the drug target gene and are selected by drug exposure; the target gene is re-expressed and sensitivity is restored following passage without drug. This silencing process involves generation of small RNA (sRNA) against the target gene via core RNAi pathway proteins. To further elucidate the role of epimutation in the broad antifungal resistance of Mucor, epimutants were isolated that confer resistance to another antifungal agent, 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). We identified epimutant strains that exhibit resistance to 5-FOA without mutations in PyrF or PyrG, enzymes which convert 5-FOA into the active toxic form. Using sRNA hybridization as well as sRNA library analysis, we demonstrate that these epimutants harbor sRNA against either pyrF or pyrG, and further show that this sRNA is lost after reversion to drug sensitivity. We conclude that epimutation is a mechanism capable of targeting multiple genes, enabling Mucor to develop resistance to a variety of antifungal agents. Elucidation of the role of RNAi in epimutation affords a fuller understanding of mucormycosis. Furthermore, it improves our understanding of fungal pathogenesis and adaptation to stresses, including the evolution of drug resistance.",

One of the challenges associated with applying this technique to zebrafish in a high-throughput manner is the absence of a cost-effective method by which to identify mutants. To address this, we optimized the high-throughput, high-resolution fluorescent PCR-based fragment analysis method to develop MultiFRAGing, a robust and cost-effective method for genotyping of multiple targets in a single reaction. Our approach can identify indels in 4 targets from a single reaction, which represents a four-fold increase in genotyping throughput.

    "abstract": "EPAC2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPase activity of the small GTPase Rap and Ras) and is highly enriched at synapses. Activation of EPAC2 has been shown to induce dendritic spine shrinkage and increase spine motility, effects that are necessary for synaptic plasticity. These morphological effects are dysregulated by rare mutations of EPAC2 associated with autism spectrum disorders. In addition, EPAC2 destabilizes synapses through the removal of synaptic GluA2/3-containing AMPA receptors. Previous work has shown that Epac2 knockout mice (Epac2-/-) display abnormal social interactions, as well as gross disorganization of the frontal cortex and abnormal spine motility in vivo. In this study we sought to further understand the cellular consequences of knocking out Epac2 on the development of neuronal and synaptic structure and organization of cortical neurons. Using primary cortical neurons generated from Epac2+/+ or Epac2-/- mice, we confirm that EPAC2 is required for cAMP-dependent spine shrinkage. Neurons from Epac2-/- mice also displayed increased synaptic expression of GluA2/3-containing AMPA receptors, as well as of the adhesion protein N-cadherin. Intriguingly, analysis of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins revealed that loss of EPAC2 resulted in altered of expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), indicating a potential imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory inputs onto neurons. Finally, examination of cortical neurons located within the anterior cingulate cortex further revealed subtle deficits in the establishment of dendritic arborization in vivo. These data provide evidence that EPAC2 is required for the correct composition of synapses and that loss of this protein could result in an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses.",

    "abstract": "The cell's dense three-dimensional (3D) actin filament network presents numerous challenges to vesicular transport by teams of myosin Va (MyoVa) molecular motors. These teams must navigate their cargo through diverse actin structures ranging from Arp2/3-branched lamellipodial networks to the dense, unbranched cortical networks. To define how actin filament network organization affects MyoVa cargo transport, we created two different 3D actin networks in vitro. One network was comprised of randomly oriented, unbranched actin filaments; the other was comprised of Arp2/3-branched actin filaments, which effectively polarized the network by aligning the actin filament plus-ends. Within both networks, we defined each actin filament's 3D spatial position, using STORM microscopy, and its polarity by observing the movement of single fluorescent, reporter MyoVa. We then characterized the 3D trajectories of fluorescent, 350 nm fluid-like, liposomes transported by MyoVa teams (~10 motors) moving within each of the two networks. Compared to the unbranched network, we observed more liposomes with directed and fewer with stationary motion on the Arp2/3-branched network. This suggests that the modes of liposome transport by MyoVa motors are influenced by changes in the local actin filament polarity alignment within the network. This mechanism was supported by an in silico 3D model that provides a broader platform to understand how cellular regulation of the actin cytoskeletal architecture may fine-tune MyoVa-based intracellular cargo transport.",

    "abstract": "While the structure of a variety of viruses has been resolved at atomistic detail, their assembly pathways remain largely elusive. Key unresolved issues in assembly are the nature of the critical nucleus starting particle growth, the subsequent self-assembly reaction and the manner in which the viral genome is compacted. These issues are difficult to address in bulk approaches and are effectively only accessible by tracking the dynamics of assembly of individual particles in real time, as we show here. With a combination of single-molecule techniques we study the assembly into rod-shaped virus-like particles (VLPs) of artificial capsid polypeptides, de-novo designed previously. Using fluorescence optical tweezers we establish that oligomers that have pre-assembled in solution bind to our DNA template. If the oligomer is smaller than a pentamer, it performs one-dimensional diffusion along the DNA, but pentamers and larger oligomers are essentially immobile and nucleate VLP growth. Next, using real-time multiplexed acoustic force spectroscopy, we show that DNA is compacted in regular steps during VLP growth. These steps, of [~]30 nm of DNA contour length, fit with a DNA packaging mechanism based on helical wrapping of the DNA around the central protein core of the VLP. By revealing how real-time, single particle tracking of VLP assembly lays bare nucleation and growth principles, our work opens the doors to a new fundamental understanding of the complex assembly pathways of natural virus particles.",

    "abstract": "Tetraploidy has long been of interest to both cell and cancer biologists, partly because of its documented role in tumorigenesis. A common model proposes that the extra centrosomes that are typically acquired during tetraploidization are responsible for driving tumorigenesis. However, this model is inconsistent with the observation that tetraploid cells evolved in culture lack extra centrosomes. This observation raises questions about how tetraploid cells evolve and more specifically about the mechanisms(s) underlying centrosome loss. Here, using a combination of fixed cell analysis, live cell imaging, and mathematical modeling, we show that populations of newly formed tetraploid cells rapidly evolve in vitro to retain a near-tetraploid chromosome number while losing the extra centrosomes gained at the time of tetraploidization. This happens through a process of natural selection in which tetraploid cells that inherit a single centrosome during a bipolar division with asymmetric centrosome clustering are favored for long-term survival.",

This process occurs through the action of molecular motors, cytoskeletal networks and the nucleus. How the combined activity of these different components is spatiotemporally regulated to ensure efficient spindle assembly remains unclear. Here we show that during prophase the centrosomes-nucleus axis reorients, so that centrosomes are positioned on the shortest nuclear axis at nuclear envelope (NE) breakdown. This centrosomes-nucleus configuration depends on mechanical cues generated by mitotic chromosome condensation on the prophase nucleus. We further show these mechanosensitive cues act through SUN1/2 and NudE+NudEL to enable the polarized loading of Dynein on the NE. Finally, we observe this centrosome configuration favors the establishment of an initial bipolar spindle scaffold, facilitating chromosome capture and accurate segregation, without compromising division plane orientation. We propose that chromosome segregation fidelity depends on the mechanical properties of the prophase nucleus that facilitate spindle assembly by regulating NE-Dynein localization.",

While Klf genes have been shown to functionally specify various cell types in non-bilaterian animals, their role in early diverging animal lineages has not been assessed. Thus, the ancestral activity of these transcription factors in animal development is not well understood. The ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi has emerged as an important non-bilaterian model system for understanding early animal evolution.

Abrogation of zygotic Klf expression during M. leidyi embryogenesis results in abnormal development of several organs including the pharynx, tentacle bulbs, and apical organ. Our data suggest an ancient role for Klf genes in regulating endodermal patterning, possibly through regulation of cell proliferation.\n\nSummary StatementUsing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown, this study shows that tissues derived from the endoderm are dependent upon Klf5 ortholog expression for proper development and patterning in the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi.",
