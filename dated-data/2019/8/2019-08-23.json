    "abstract": "Methylated amines are ubiquitous in the environment and play a role in regulating the earths climate via a set of complex biological and chemical reactions. Microbial degradation of these compounds is thought to be a major sink. Recently we isolated a facultative methylotroph, Gemmobacter sp. LW-1, an isolate from the unique environment Movile Cave, Romania, which is capable of methylated amine utilisation as a carbon source. Here, using a comparative genomics approach, we investigate how widespread methylated amine utilisation trait is within the member of the bacterial genus Gemmobacter. Five genomes of different Gemmobacter species isolated from diverse environments, such as activated sludge, fresh water, sulphuric cave waters (Movile Cave) and the marine environment were available from the public repositories and used for the analysis. Our results indicate that some members of the genus Gemmobacter, namely G. aquatilis, G. caeni and G. sp. LW-1 have the genetic potential of methylated amine utilisation while others (G. megaterium and G. nectariphilus) have not.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe use of DNA data is ubiquitous across animal sciences. DNA may be obtained from an organism for a myriad of reasons including identification and distinction between cryptic species, sex identification, comparisons of different morphocryptic genotypes or assessments of relatedness between organisms prior to a behavioural study. DNA should be obtained while minimizing the impact on the fitness, behaviour or welfare of the subject being tested, as this can bias experimental results and cause long-lasting effects on wild animals. Furthermore, minimizing impact on experimental animals is a key Refinement principle within the  3Rs framework which aims to ensure that animal welfare during experimentation is optimised. The term  non-invasive DNA sampling has been defined to indicate collection methods that do not require capture or cause disturbance to the animal, including any effects on behaviour or fitness. In practice this is not always the case, as the term  non-invasive is commonly used in the literature to describe studies where animals are restrained or subjected to aversive procedures. We reviewed the non-invasive DNA sampling literature for the past six years (380 papers published in 2013-2018) and uncovered the existence of a significant gap between the current use of this terminology (i.e.  non-invasive DNA sampling) and its original definition. We show that 58% of the reviewed papers did not comply with the original definition. We discuss the main experimental and ethical issues surrounding the potential confusion or misuse of the phrase  non-invasive DNA sampling in the current literature and provide potential solutions. In addition, we introduce the terms  non-disruptive and  minimally disruptive DNA sampling, to indicate methods that eliminate or minimise impacts not on the physical integrity/structure of the animal, but on its behaviour, fitness and welfare, which in the literature reviewed corresponds to the situation for which an accurate term is clearly missing. Furthermore, we outline when these methods are appropriate to use.",

    "abstract": "Can human listeners use strictly implicit temporal contingencies in auditory input to form temporal predictions, and if so, how are these predictions represented endogenously? To assess this question, we implicitly manipulated foreperiods in an auditory pitch discrimination task. Unbeknownst to participants, the pitch of the standard tone could either be deterministically predictive of the onset of the target tone, or convey no predictive information. Both conditions were presented interleaved in one stream, and separated by variable inter-stimulus intervals such that there was no dominant stimulus rhythm throughout. Even though participants were unaware of the implicit temporal contingencies, pitch discrimination sensitivity (i.e. the slope of the psychometric function) increased when the onset of the target tone was predictable in time (N = 49). Concurrently recorded EEG data (N = 24) revealed that standard tones which initiated temporal predictions evoked a more negative N1 component than non-predictive standards, and were followed by an increase in delta power during the foreperiod. Furthermore, the phase angle of delta oscillations (1-3Hz) evoked by the standard tone predicted pitch discrimination sensitivity at the target tone (1.75 s later on average), which suggests that temporal predictions can be initiated by an optimized delta phase reset. In sum, we show that auditory perception benefits from implicit temporal contingencies, and provide evidence for a role of slow neural oscillations in the endogenous representation of temporal predictions, in absence of exogenously driven entrainment to rhythmic input.\n\nSignificance StatementTemporal contingencies are ubiquitous in sensory environments, especially in the auditory domain, and have been shown to facilitate perception and action. Yet, how these contingencies in exogenous inputs are transformed into an endogenous representation of temporal predictions is not known. Here, we implicitly induced temporal predictability in the absence of a rhythmic input structure, that is without exogenously driven entrainment of neural oscillations. Our results show that even implicit and non-rhythmic temporal predictions are extracted and used by human observers, underlining the role of timing in sensory processing. Furthermore, our EEG results point towards an instrumental role of delta oscillations in initiating temporal predictions by an optimized phase reset in response to a temporally predictive cue.",

We evaluated sixteen pipelines for reconstructing the evolutionary histories of 293 localized prostate cancers from single samples, and eighteen pipelines for the reconstruction of 10 tumours with multi-region sampling. We show that predictions of subclonal architecture and timing of somatic mutations vary extensively across pipelines. Pipelines show consistent types of biases, with those incorporating SomaticSniper and Battenberg preferentially predicting homogenous cancer cell populations and those using MuTect tending to predict multiple populations of cancer cells. Subclonal reconstructions using multi-region sampling confirm that single-sample reconstructions systematically underestimate intra-tumoural heterogeneity, predicting on average fewer than half of the cancer cell populations identified by multi-region sequencing. Overall, these biases suggest caution in interpreting specific architectures and subclonal variants.",

    "abstract": "Mitophagy is an important quality control mechanism in eukaryotic cells, and defects in mitophagy correlate with aging phenomena and neurodegenerative disorders. It is known that different mitochondrial matrix proteins undergo mitophagy with very different rates, but to date the mechanism underlying this selectivity at the individual protein level has remained obscure. We now present evidence indicating that protein phosphorylation within the mitochondrial matrix plays a mechanistic role in regulating selective mitophagic degradation in yeast, via involvement of the Aup1 mitochondrial protein phosphatase, as well as two known matrix-localized protein kinases, Pkp1 and Pkp2. By focusing on a specific matrix phosphoprotein reporter, we also demonstrate that phospho-mimetic and non-phosphorylatable point mutations at known phosphosites in the reporter increased or decreased its tendency to undergo mitophagy. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of the reporter protein is dynamically regulated during mitophagy, in an Aup1-dependent manner. Our results indicate that structural determinants on a mitochondrial matrix protein can govern its mitophagic fate, and that protein phosphorylation regulates these determinants.\\n\\nSignificance statementMitochondrial dysfunction underlies many age-related human pathologies. In normal cells, defective mitochondria are often degraded by mitophagy, a process in which these mitochondria are engulfed in autophagosomes and sent for degradation in the lysosome/vacuole. Surprisingly, studies on mitophagy in diverse eukaryotic organisms reveal an unexpected dimension of protein-level selectivity, wherein individual protein species exhibit divergent rates of mitophagic degradation. In this manuscript, we show that this surprising intra-mitochondrial selectivity can be generated by differential phosphorylation of individual mitochondrial protein species, and we identify mitochondrial phosphatases and kinases which contribute to this regulation. By identifying a mechanism which regulates the intra-mitochondrial selectivity of mitophagic degradation, our findings open the door to potential manipulation of the quality control process in the future.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCholera remains a major public health concern, particularly in refugee camps, which may contend with overcrowding and scarcity of resources. Maela, the largest long-standing refugee camp in Thailand, experienced four cholera outbreaks between 2005 and 2010. In 2013, a cholera vaccine campaign was implemented in the camp. To assist in the evaluation of the campaign and planning for subsequent campaigns, we developed a mathematical model of cholera in Maela.\n\nMethodsWe formulated a Susceptible-Infectious-Water-Recovered-based cholera transmission model and estimated parameters using incidence data from 2010. We next evaluated the reduction in cases conferred by several immunization strategies, varying timing, effectiveness, and resources (i.e., vaccine availability). Finally, we generated post-campaign case forecasts, to determine whether a booster campaign was needed.\n\nResultsWe found that preexposure vaccination can substantially reduce the risk of cholera even when the < 50% of the population is given the full two-dose series. Additionally, the preferred number of doses per person should be considered in the context of one vs. two dose effectiveness and vaccine availability. For reactive vaccination, a trade-off between timing and effectiveness was revealed, indicating that it may be beneficial to give one dose to more people rather than two doses to fewer people, given that a two-dose schedule would incur a delay in administration of the second dose. Forecasting using realistic coverage levels predicted that there was no need for a booster campaign in 2014 (consistent with our predictions, there was not a cholera epidemic in the 2014 season).\n\nConclusionsOur analyses suggest that vaccination in conjunction with ongoing water sanitation and hygiene efforts provides an effective strategy for cholera outbreaks in refugee camps. Effective preexposure vaccination depends on timing and effectiveness. If a camp is facing an outbreak, delayed distribution of vaccines can substantially alter the effectiveness of reactive vaccination, suggesting that quick distribution of vaccines may be more important than ensuring every individual receives both vaccine doses.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis may be accelerated by oxidative stress, which produces lipid peroxidation. Among the products of lipid peroxidation are highly reactive dicarbonyls including isolevuglandins (IsoLGs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) that covalently modify proteins. We investigated the impact of treatment with the dicarbonyl scavenger, 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) on HDL function and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic Ldlr-/- mice, a model of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Compared to mice treated with vehicle, 2-HOBA significantly decreased atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic Ldlr-/- mice by 31% in the proximal aortas and 60% in en face aortas, in the absence of changes in blood lipid levels. 2-HOBA reduced MDA content in HDL and LDL. Consuming a western diet increased plasma MDA-apoAI adduct levels in Ldlr-/- mice. 2-HOBA inhibited MDA-apoAI formation and increased the capacity of the mouse HDL to reduce macrophage cholesterol stores. Importantly, 2-HOBA reduced the MDA- and IsoLG-lysyl content in atherosclerotic aortas in Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, 2-HOBA diminished oxidative stress-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages, reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in atherosclerotic lesions by 72%, and decreased serum proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, 2-HOBA enhanced efferocytosis and promoted characteristics of stable plaque formation in mice as evidenced by a 69% (p<0.01) reduction in necrotic core and by increased collagen content (2.7-fold) and fibrous cap thickness (2.1-fold). HDL from patients with FH had increased MDA content resulting in a reduced ability of FH-HDL to decrease macrophage cholesterol content versus controls. Our results demonstrate that dicarbonyl scavenging with 2-HOBA has multiple atheroprotective effects on lipoproteins and reduces atherosclerosis in a murine model of FH, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nAbbreviations2-HOBA, 2-hydroxybenzylamine; 4-HOBA, 4-hydroxybenzylamine; MDA, malondialdehyde; 4-HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; IsoLGs, isolevuglandins; HDL, high-density lipoproteins; LDL, lowdensity lipoprotein; LDLR, low-density lipoprotein receptor; ApoAI, apolipoprotein AI; ApoB, apolipoprotein B; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IL, interleukin.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORCl) plays an important role in dendritic translation, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. We previously showed that heavy alcohol use activates mTORC1 in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of rodents. Here, we set out to determine the consequences of alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation in the OFC. We found that although inhibition of mTORC1 in the OFC does not alter rat alcohol intake per se, it attenuates alcohol seeking. We then tested whether mTORC1 in the OFC is required for goal-directed or habitual alcohol seeking. To do so, rats were trained self-administer alcohol under a random ratio (RR) or a random interval (RI) schedule of reinforcement, which biases toward goal-directed or habitual responding, respectively, and tested whether mTORC1 inhibition alters lever presses following alcohol devaluation. We found that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 or knockdown of the adaptor protein, Raptor, did not affect goal-directed alcohol responding but restored sensitivity to devaluation in RI-trained rats. In contrast, habitual responding for sucrose was unaltered by mTORC1 inhibition. These data suggest that mTORC1 in the OFC drives alcohol habit. We then elucidate the mechanism by which mTORC1 is activated by alcohol, and found that the recruitment of GluN2B during alcohol withdrawal stimulates mTORC1 in OFC cFos-positive neurons. Finally, we show that inhibition of GluN2B in the OFC attenuates both alcohol seeking and habitual responding for alcohol. Together, our data suggest that alcohol withdrawal promotes an NMDAR-dependent activation of mTORC1 which in turn drives habitual alcohol seeking.",

    "abstract": "Human-mediated transport creates secondary contacts between genetically differentiated lineages, bringing new opportunities for gene exchange. When similar introductions occur in different places, they provide informally replicated experiments for studying hybridisation. We here examined 4279 Mytilus mussels, sampled in Europe and genotyped with 77 ancestry informative markers. We identified a type of introduced mussels, called  dock mussels, associated with port habitats and displaying a particular genetic signal of admixture between M. edulis and the Mediterranean lineage of M. galloprovincialis. These mussels exhibit similarities in their ancestry compositions, regardless of the local native genetic backgrounds and the distance separating colonised ports. We observed fine-scale genetic shifts at the port entrance, at scales below natural dispersal distance. Such sharp clines do not fit with migration-selection tension zone models, and instead suggest habitat choice and early stage adaptation to the port environment, possibly coupled with connectivity barriers. Variations in the spread and admixture patterns of dock mussels seem to be influenced by the local native genetic backgrounds encountered. We next examined departures from the average admixture rate at different loci, and compared human-mediated admixture events, to naturally admixed populations and experimental crosses. When the same M. galloprovincialis background was involved, positive correlations in the departures of loci across locations were found; but when different backgrounds were involved, no or negative correlations were observed. While some observed positive correlations might be best explained by a shared history and saltatory colonisation, others are likely produced by parallel selective events. Altogether, genome-wide effect of admixture seems repeatable, and more dependent on genetic background than environmental context. Our results pave the way towards further genomic analyses of admixture, and monitoring of the spread of dock mussels both at large and fine spacial scales.",

    "abstract": "Deep sequencing of transposon mutant libraries (or TnSeq) is a powerful method for probing essentiality of genomic loci under different environmental conditions. Various analytical methods have been described for identifying conditionally essential genes whose tolerance for insertions varies between two conditions. However, for large-scale experiments involving many conditions, a method is needed for identifying genes that exhibit significant variability in insertions across multiple conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical method for identifying genes with significant variability of insertion counts across multiple conditions based on Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression. Using likelihood ratio tests, we show that the ZINB fits TnSeq data better than either ANOVA or a Negative Binomial (in a generalized linear model). We use ZINB regression to identify genes required for infection of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in C57BL/6 mice. We also use ZINB to perform a retrospective analysis of genes conditionally essential in H37Rv cultures exposed to multiple antibiotics. Our results show that, not only does ZINB generally identify most of the genes found by pairwise resampling (and vastly out-performs ANOVA), but it also identifies additional genes where variability is detectable only when the magnitudes of insertion counts are treated separately from local differences in saturation, as in the ZINB model.",

    "abstract": "Amblyopia, a disorder in which vision through one of the eyes is degraded, arises because of defective processing of information by the visual system. Amblyopia often develops in humans after early misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), and can be simulated in macaque monkeys by artificially inducing strabismus. In such amblyopic animals, single-unit responses in primary visual cortex (V1) are appreciably reduced when evoked by the amblyopic eye compared to the other (fellow) eye. However, this degradation in single V1 neuron responsivity is not commensurate with the marked losses in visual sensitivity and resolution measured behaviorally. Here we explored the idea that changes in patterns of coordinated activity across populations of V1 neurons may contribute to degraded visual representations in amblyopia, potentially making it more difficult to read out evoked activity to support perceptual decisions. We studied the visually-evoked activity of V1 neuronal populations in three macaques (M. nemestrina) with strabismic amblyopia and in one control. Activity driven through the amblyopic eye was diminished, and these responses also showed more interneuronal correlation at all stimulus contrasts than responses driven through the fellow eye or responses in the control. A decoding analysis showed that responses driven through the amblyopic eye carried less visual information than other responses. Our results suggest that part of the reduced visual capacity of amblyopes may be due to changes in the patterns of functional interaction among neurons in V1.\\n\\nNew and noteworthyAmblyopia is a developmental disorder of visual processing that reduces visual function and changes the visual responses of cortical neurons in macaque monkeys. The neuronal and behavioral changes are not always well correlated. We found that the interactions among neurons in the visual cortex of monkeys with amblyopia are also altered. These changes may contribute to amblyopic visual deficits by diminishing the amount of information relayed by neuronal populations driven by the amblyopic eye.",

    "abstract": "Several million traumatic brain injury (TBI) events are reported in the United States annually. However, mild TBI events often go unreported, and mild and repetitive mild TBI conditions are challenging to model. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) have gained traction for the study of TBI. The best-characterized fly TBI model is the high-impact trauma (HIT) method. We replicated the HIT method and confirmed several previous findings at the standard level of injury severity. We then expanded upon the HIT model by characterizing mortality across three reduced levels of injury severity. Importantly, we found reduced mortality with reduced injury severity and synergistic effects on mortality in response to repetitive TBI by our moderate injury conditions. Last, we compared moderate, repetitive TBI to a single severe TBI via assessment of the pattern of mortality and geotaxis performance in the 24 h following TBI. We found the number and severity of injuries could result in different patterns of death, while all TBI conditions led to impaired geotaxis compared to uninjured flies at 0.5 h and 6 h post-TBI. Thus, we have extended a well-characterized model of TBI in flies, and shown the utility of this model for making unique insights into TBI across various severities, injury numbers, and time-points post-injury.",

Goal-trackers attribute predictive value to reward-cues, and sign-trackers attribute both predictive and incentive value. Using chemogenetics and microdialysis, we show that, in sign-trackers, stimulation of the neuronal pathway from the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) decreases the incentive value of a reward-cue. In contrast, in goal-trackers, inhibition of the PrL-PVT pathway increases both the incentive value and dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens shell. The PrL-PVT pathway, therefore, exerts top-down control over the dopamine-dependent process of incentive salience attribution. These results highlight PrL-PVT pathway as a potential target for treating psychopathologies associated with the attribution of excessive incentive value to reward-cues, including addiction.",

    "abstract": "Motion of the pelvis throughout a step predicts step width during human walking. This behavior is often considered an important component of ensuring bipedal stability, but can be disrupted in populations with neurological injuries. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a novel force-field that exerts mediolateral forces on the legs can manipulate the relationship between pelvis motion and step width, providing proof-of-concept for a future clinical intervention. We designed a force-field able to: 1) minimize the delivered mediolateral forces (Transparent mode); 2) apply mediolateral forces to assist the leg toward mechanically-appropriate step widths (Assistive mode); and 3) apply mediolateral forces to perturb the leg away from mechanically-appropriate step widths (Perturbing mode). Neurologically-intact participants were randomly assigned to either the Assistive group (n=12) or Perturbing group (n=12), and performed a series of walking trials in which they interfaced with the force-field. We quantified the step-by-step relationship between mediolateral pelvis displacement and step width using partial correlations. Walking in the Transparent force-field had a minimal effect on this relationship. However, force-field assistance directly strengthened the relationship between pelvis displacement and step width, whereas force-field perturbations weakened this relationship. Both assistance and perturbations were followed by short-lived effects during a wash-out period, in which the relationship between pelvis displacement and step width differed from the baseline value. The present results demonstrate that the link between pelvis motion and step width can be manipulated through mechanical means, which may be useful for retraining gait balance in clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "Variability of neural activity is regarded as a crucial feature of healthy brain function, and several neuroimaging approaches have been employed to assess it noninvasively. Studies on the variability of both evoked brain response and spontaneous brain signals have shown remarkable changes with aging but it is unclear if the different measures of brain signal variability - identified with either hemodynamic or electrophysiological methods - reflect the same underlying physiology. In this study, we aimed to explore age differences of spontaneous brain signal variability with two different imaging modalities (EEG, fMRI) in healthy younger (25{+/-}3 years, N=135) and older (67{+/-}4 years, N=54) adults. Consistent with the previous studies, we found lower blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) variability in the older subjects as well as less signal variability in the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations (1-12 Hz), measured in source space. These age-related reductions were mostly observed in the areas that overlap with the default mode network. Moreover, age-related increases of variability in the amplitude of beta-band frequency EEG oscillations (15-25 Hz) were seen predominantly in temporal brain regions. There were significant sex differences in EEG signal variability in various brain regions while no significant sex differences were observed in BOLD signal variability. Bivariate and multivariate correlation analyses revealed no significant associations between EEG- and fMRI-based variability measures. In summary, we show that both BOLD and EEG signal variability reflect aging-related processes but are likely to be dominated by different physiological origins, which relate differentially to age and sex.",

    "abstract": "Body ownership relies on spatiotemporal correlations between multisensory signals and visual cues specifying oneself such as body form and orientation. The mechanism for the integration of bodily signals remains unclear. One approach to model multisensory integration that has been influential in the multisensory literature is Bayesian causal inference. This specifies that the brain integrates spatial and temporal signals coming from different modalities when it infers a common cause for inputs. As an example, the rubber hand illusion shows that visual form and orientation cues can promote the inference of a common cause (ones body) leading to spatial integration shown by a proprioceptive drift of the perceived location of the real hand towards the rubber hand. Recent studies investigating the effect of visual cues on temporal integration, however, have led to conflicting findings. These could be due to task differences, variation in ecological validity of stimuli and/or small samples. In this pre-registered study, we investigated the influence of visual information on temporal integration using a visuo-tactile temporal order judgement task with realistic stimuli and a sufficiently large sample determined by Bayesian analysis. Participants viewed videos of a touch being applied to plausible or implausible visual stimuli for ones hand (hand oriented plausibly, hand rotated 180 degrees, or a sponge) while also being touched at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. Participants judged which stimulus came first: viewed or felt touch. Results show that visual cues do not modulate visuo-tactile temporal order judgements. This is not in line with the idea that bodily signals indicating oneself influence the integration of multisensory signals in the temporal domain. The current study emphasises the importance of rigour in our methodologies and analyses to advance the understanding of how properties of multisensory events affect the encoding of temporal information in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Treatment options are limited for the approximately 40% of postmenopausal women worldwide who suffer from female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Neural stimulation has shown potential as a treatment for genital arousal FSD, however the mechanisms for its improvement are unknown. One potential cause of some cases of genital arousal FSD are changes to the composition of the vaginal microbiota, which is associated with vulvovaginal atrophy. The primary hypothesis of this study was that neural stimulation may induce healthy changes in the vaginal microbiome, thereby improving genital arousal FSD symptoms. In this study we used healthy rats, which are a common animal model for sexual function, however the rat vaginal microbiome is understudied. Thus this study also sought to examine the composition of the rat vaginal microbiota. Treatment rats (n=5) received 30 minutes of cutaneous electrical stimulation targeting the genital branch of the pudendal nerve, and Control animals (n=4) had 30-minute sessions without stimulation. Vaginal lavage samples were taken during a 14-day baseline period including multiple estrous periods and after twice-weekly 30-minute sessions across a six-week trial period. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences was used to characterize the rat vaginal microbiota in baseline samples and determine the effect of stimulation. We found that the rat vaginal microbiota is dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, which changed in relative abundance during the estrous cycle and in relationship to each other. While the overall stimulation effects were unclear in these healthy rats, some Treatment animals had less alteration in microbiota composition between sequential samples than Control animals, suggesting that stimulation may help stabilize the vaginal microbiome. Future studies may consider additional physiological parameters, in addition to the microbiome composition, to further examine vaginal health and the effects of stimulation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate prediction of exacerbation risk enables personalised chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) care. We developed and validated a generalisable model to predict the individualised rate and severity of COPD exacerbations.\n\nMethodsWe pooled data from three COPD trials on patients with a history of exacerbations. We developed a mixed-effect model to predict exacerbations over one-year. Severe exacerbations were those requiring inpatient care. Predictors were a history of exacerbations, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, domiciliary oxygen therapy, lung function, symptom burden, and current medication use. ECLIPSE, a multicentre cohort study, was used for external validation.\n\nResultsThe development dataset included 2,380 patients (mean 64{middle dot}7 years, 1373 [57{middle dot}7%] men, mean exacerbation rate 1{middle dot}42/year, 0{middle dot}29/year [20{middle dot}5%] severe). When validated against all COPD patients in ECLIPSE (n=1819, mean 63{middle dot}3 years, 1186 [65{middle dot}2%] men, mean exacerbation rate 1{middle dot}20/year, 0{middle dot}27/year [22{middle dot}2%] severe), the area-under-curve was 0{middle dot}81 (95%CI 0{middle dot}79-0{middle dot}83) for [&ge;]2 exacerbations and 0{middle dot}77 (95%CI 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}80) for [&ge;]1 severe exacerbation. Predicted rates were 0{middle dot}25/year for severe and 1{middle dot}31/year for all exacerbations, close to the observed rates (0{middle dot}27/year and 1{middle dot}20/year, respectively). In ECLIPSE patients with a prior exacerbation history (n=996, mean 63{middle dot}6 years, 611 (61{middle dot}3%) men, mean exacerbation rate 1{middle dot}82/year, 0{middle dot}40/year [22{middle dot}0%] severe), the area-under-curve was 0{middle dot}73 (95%CI 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}76) for [&ge;]2 exacerbations and 0{middle dot}74 (95%CI 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}78) for [&ge;]1 severe exacerbation. Calibration was accurate for severe exacerbations (predicted=0{middle dot}37/year, observed=0{middle dot}40/year) and all exacerbations (predicted=1{middle dot}80/year, observed=1{middle dot}82/year). The model is accessible at http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/accept.\n\nInterpretationThis model can be used as a decision tool to personalise COPD treatment and prevent exacerbations.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPreventing future exacerbations is a major goal in COPD care. Because of adverse effects, preventative treatments should be reserved for those at a higher risk of future exacerbations. Predicting exacerbation risk in individual patients can guide these clinical decisions. A 2017 systematic review reported that of the 27 identified COPD exacerbation prediction tools, only two had reported external validation and none was ready for clinical implementation. To find the studies that were published afterwards, we searched PubMed for articles on development and validation of COPD exacerbation prediction since 2015, using the search terms \"COPD\", \"exacerbation\", \"model\", and \"validation\". We included studies that reported prediction of either the risk or the rate of exacerbations and excluded studies that did not report external validation. Our literature search revealed two more prediction models neither of which was deemed generalisable due to lack of methodological rigour, or local and limited nature of the data available to investigators.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe used data from three randomised trials to develop ACCEPT, a clinical prediction tool based on routinely available predictors for COPD exacerbations. We externally validated ACCEPT in a large, multinational prospective cohort. To our knowledge, ACCEPT is the first COPD exacerbation prediction tool that jointly estimates the individualised rate and severity of exacerbations. Successful external validation of ACCEPT showed that its generalisability can be expanded across geography and beyond the setting of therapeutic trials. ACCEPT is designed to be easily applicable in clinical practice and is readily accessible as a web application.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceCurrent guidelines rely on a history of exacerbations as the sole predictor of future exacerbations. Simple clinical and demographic variables, in aggregate, can be used to predict COPD exacerbations with improved accuracy. ACCEPT enables a more personalised approach to treatment based on routinely collected clinical data by allowing clinicians to objectively differentiate risk profiles of patients with similar exacerbation history. Care providers and patients can use individualised exacerbation risk estimates to decide on preventive therapies based on objectively-established or patient-specific thresholds for treatment benefit and harm. COPD clinical researchers can use this tool to target enriched populations for enrolment in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "A subanesthetic dose of ketamine causes acute psychotomimetic symptoms and then more sustained antidepressant effects. A key targeted brain region is the prefrontal cortex, and the prevailing disinhibition hypothesis posits that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine may act preferentially on GABAergic neurons. However, cortical GABAergic neurons are heterogeneous. In particular, somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons selectively inhibit dendrites and regulate synaptic inputs, yet their response to systemic NMDAR antagonism is unknown. Here, we report that administration of ketamine acutely suppresses the activity of SST interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of the awake mouse. The deficient dendritic inhibition leads to greater synaptically evoked calcium transients in the apical dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons. By manipulating NMDAR signaling via GluN2B knockdown, we show that ketamines actions on the dendritic inhibitory mechanism has ramifications for frontal cortex-dependent behaviors and cortico-cortical connectivity. Collectively, these results demonstrate dendritic disinhibition and elevated calcium levels in dendritic spines as important local-circuit alterations driven by the administration of subanesthetic ketamine.",

We establish sequence-based correlates to tRNA gene expression and develop a tRNA gene classification method that does not require, but benefits from comparative genomic information, and achieves accuracy comparable to molecular assays. We observe that guanine+cytosine (G+C) content and CpG density surrounding tRNA loci is exceptionally well correlated with tRNA gene activity, supporting a prominent regulatory role of the local genomic context in combination with internal sequence features. We use our tRNA gene activity predictions in conjunction with a comprehensive tRNA gene ortholog set spanning 29 placental mammals to infer the frequency of changes to tRNA gene expression among orthologs. Our method adds an important new dimension to tRNA annotation and will help focus the study of natural tRNA variants. Its simplicity and robustness enables facile application to other clades and timescales, as well as exploration of functional diversification of tRNAs and other large gene families.",

    "abstract": "Despite a very effective vaccine, active conflict and community distrust during the ongoing DRC Ebola epidemic are undermining control efforts, including a ring vaccination strategy that requires the prompt immunization of close contacts of infected individuals. However, in April 2019, it was reported 20% or more of close contacts cannot be reached or refuse vaccination [1], and it is predicted that the ring vaccination strategy would not be effective with such a high level of inaccessibility [2]. The vaccination strategy is now incorporating a \"third ring\" community-level vaccination that targets members of communities even if they are not known contacts of Ebola cases. To assess the impact of vaccination strategies for controlling Ebola epidemics in the context of variable levels of community accessibility, we employed an individual-level stochastic transmission model that incorporates four sources of heterogeneity: a proportion of the population is inaccessible for contact tracing and vaccination due to lack of confidence in interventions or geographic inaccessibility, two levels of population mixing resembling household and community transmission, two types of vaccine doses with different time periods until immunity, and transmission rates that depend on spatial distance. Our results indicate that a ring vaccination strategy alone would not be effective for containing the epidemic in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts even for low levels of household inaccessibility and affirm the positive impact of a supplemental community vaccination strategy. Our key results are that as levels of inaccessibility increase, there is a qualitative change in the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy. For higher levels of vaccine access, the probability that the epidemic will end steadily increases over time, even if probabilities are lower than they would be otherwise with full community participation. For levels of vaccine access that are too low, however, the vaccination strategies are not expected to be successful in ending the epidemic even though they help lower incidence levels, which saves lives, and makes the epidemic easier to contain and reduces spread to other communities. This qualitative change occurs for both types of vaccination strategies: ring vaccination is effective for containing an outbreak until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 10% in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts, a combined ring and community vaccination strategy is effective until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 50%. More broadly, our results underscore the need to enhance community engagement to public health interventions in order to enhance the effectiveness of control interventions to ensure outbreak containment.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the context of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in DRC, active conflict and community distrust are undermining control efforts, including vaccination strategies. In this paper, we employed an individual-level stochastic structured transmission model to assess the impact of vaccination strategies on epidemic control in the context of variable levels of household inaccessibility. We found that a ring vaccination strategy of close contacts would not be effective for containing the epidemic in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts even for low levels of household inaccessibility and evaluate the impact of a supplemental community vaccination strategy. For lower levels of inaccessibility, the probability of epidemic containment increases over time. For higher levels of inaccessibility, even the combined ring and community vaccination strategies are not expected to contain the epidemic even though they help lower incidence levels, which saves lives, makes the epidemic easier to contain and reduces spread to other communities. We found that ring vaccination is effective for containing an outbreak until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 10%, a combined ring and community vaccination strategy is effective until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 50%.

    "abstract": "Marine microbial primary production is influenced by the availability and uptake of essential nutrients, including iron. Although marine microbes have evolved mechanisms to scavenge sub-nanomolar concentrations of iron, recent observations suggest that viruses may co-opt these very same mechanisms to facilitate infection. The \\\"Ferrojan Horse Hypothesis\\\" proposes that viruses incorporate iron atoms into their tail fiber proteins to adsorb to target host receptors. Here, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic approach to consider the joint strategies of hosts and viruses in environments with limited nutrients (like iron). We analyze the bimatrix game and find that evolutionarily stable strategies depend on the stability and quality of nutrient conditions. For example, in highly stable iron conditions, virus pressure does not change host uptake strategies. However, when iron levels are dynamic, virus pressure can lead to fluctuations in the extent to which hosts invest in metabolic machinery that increases both iron uptake and susceptibility to viral infection. Altogether, this evolutionary game model provides further evidence that viral infection and nutrient dynamics jointly shape the fate of microbial populations.",

    "abstract": "The steady state distributions of phenotypic responses within an isogenic population of cells result from both deterministic and stochastic characteristics of biochemical networks. A biochemical network can be characterized by a multidimensional potential landscape based on the distribution of responses and a diffusion matrix of the correlated dynamic fluctuations between N-numbers of intracellular network variables. The Boltzmann H-function defines the rate of free energy dissipation of a network system and provides a framework for determining the heat associated with the nonequilibrium steady state and its network components. We conjecture that there is an upper limit to the rate of dissipative heat produced by a biological system, and we show that the dissipative heat has a lower bound. The magnitudes of the landscape gradients and the dynamic correlated fluctuations of network variables are experimentally accessible, and through an analysis that we refer to as Thermo-Fokker-Planck (Thermo-FP), provide insight into the composition of the network and the relative thermodynamic contributions from network components. We surmise that these thermodynamic quantities allow determination of the relative importance of network components to overall network control.",

    "abstract": "Life expectancy and obesity rates have drastically increased in recent years. An unhealthy weight is related to long-lasting biological deregulations that might compromise the normal course of aging. The aim of the current study was to test whether the network composition of young adults with obesity would show signs of premature aging. To this end, subjects with obesity (N = 30, mean age 32.8 {+/-} 5.68), healthy-weight controls (N = 33, mean age 30.9 {+/-} 6.24) as well as non-demented seniors (N = 30, mean age 67.1 {+/-} 6.65) all underwent a resting-state MRI acquisition. Functional connectivity was studied by means of graph-theory measurements (i.e., small-world index, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and mean degree). Contrary to what expected, obesity in adults was related to disruptions in small-world properties driven by increases in network segregation (i.e., clustering coefficient) as compared to elders. Also, this group showed alterations in global and regional centrality metrics (i.e., degree) relative to controls and seniors. Despite not mimicking what was here shown by seniors, the topological organization linked to an obesity status may represent a flaw for cognitive functions depending on the rapid combination between different modular communities.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the family Togaviridae, has recently emerged in the Americas from lineages from two continents, Asia and Africa. Historically, CHIKV circulated as at least four lineages worldwide with both enzootic and epidemic transmission cycles. To understand the recent patterns of emergence and the current status of the CHIKV spread, updated analyses of the viral genetic data and metadata are needed. Here, we performed phylogenetic and comparative genomics screens of CHIKV genomes, taking advantage of the public availability of many recently sequenced isolates. Based on these new data and analyses, we derive a revised phylogeny from nucleotide sequences in coding regions. Using this phylogeny, we uncover the presence of several distinct lineages in Africa that were previously considered a single one. In parallel, we performed thermodynamic modeling of CHIKV untranslated regions (UTRs), which revealed evolutionarily conserved structured and unstructured RNA elements in the 3UTR. We provide evidence for duplication events in recently emerged American isolates of the Asian CHIKV lineage and propose the existence of a flexible 3UTR architecture among different CHIKV lineages.",

    "abstract": "Telomere maintenance by telomerase is essential for continuous proliferation of human cells and is vital for the survival of stem cells and 90% of cancer cells. To compensate for telomeric DNA lost during DNA replication, telomerase processively adds GGTTAG repeats to chromosome ends by copying the template region within its RNA subunit. Between repeat additions, the RNA template must be recycled. How telomerase remains associated with substrate DNA during this critical translocation step remains unknown. Using a newly developed single-molecule telomerase activity assay utilizing high-resolution optical tweezers, we demonstrate that stable substrate DNA binding at an anchor site within telomerase facilitates the processive synthesis of telomeric repeats. After release of multiple telomeric repeats from telomerase, we observed folding of product DNA into G-quadruplex structures. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into telomerase catalysis, a process of critical importance in aging and cancer.",

Evidence suggests that T cells that target neoantigens are the main mediators of effective cancer immunotherapies. Although algorithms have been used to predict neoantigens, only a minority are immunogenic. The factors that influence neoantigen immunogenicity are not completely understood. Here, we classified human neoantigen/neopeptide data into three categories based on their TCR-pMHC binding events. We observed a conservative mutant orientation of the anchor residue from immunogenic neoantigens which we termed the \"NP\" rule. By integrating this rule with an existing prediction algorithm, we found improved performance in neoantigen prioritization. To better understand this rule, we solved several neoantigen/MHC structures. These structures showed that neoantigens that follow this rule not only increase peptide-MHC binding affinity but also create new TCR-binding features. These molecular insights highlight the value of immune-based classification in neoantigen studies and may enable the design of more effective cancer immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "The liver X receptor (LXR) is a key transcriptional regulator of cholesterol, fatty acid, and phospholipid metabolism. Dynamic remodeling of immunometabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism, is a crucial step in T cell activation. Here we explored the role of LXR-regulated metabolic processes in primary human CD4+ T cells, and their role in controlling plasma membrane lipids (glycosphingolipids and cholesterol) which strongly influence T cell immune signaling and function. Crucially, we identified the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (UGCG) as a direct transcriptional LXR target. LXR activation by agonist GW3965 or endogenous oxysterol ligands significantly altered the glycosphingolipid:cholesterol balance in the plasma membrane by increasing glycosphingolipid levels and reducing cholesterol. Consequently, LXR activation lowered plasma membrane lipid order (stability), and an LXR antagonist could block this effect. LXR stimulation also reduced lipid order at the immune synapse and accelerated activation of proximal T cell signaling molecules. Ultimately, LXR activation dampened pro-inflammatory T cell function. Finally, compared to responder T cells, regulatory T cells had a distinct pattern of LXR-target gene expression corresponding to reduced lipid order. This suggests LXR-driven lipid metabolism could contribute to functional specialization of these T cell subsets. Overall, we report a novel mode of action for LXR in T cells involving the regulation of glycosphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism, and demonstrate its relevance in modulating T cell function.",

This allows one-time learning to take place through strengthening entire patterns of activation at one go. We present a model that accepts a salience signal, and returns a reverse salience signal. We demonstrate that we can tag an image with salience with only a single training iteration, and that the same image will then produces the highest reverse salience signal during classification. We explore the effects of salience on learning via its effect on the activation functions of each node, as well as on the strength of weights in the network. We demonstrate that a salience signal improves classification accuracy of the specific image that was tagged with salience, as well as all images in the same class, while penalizing images in other classes. Results are validated using 5-fold validation testing on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. This research serves as a proof of concept, and could be the first step towards introducing salience tagging into Deep Learning Networks and robotics.",

Interestingly, Ctf4 binds only one Pol -primase. Thus, Ctf4 may have evolved as a trimer to organize two helicases and one Pol -primase into a replication factory. In the 2CMG-Ctf43-1Pol -primase factory model, the two CMGs nearly face each other, placing the two lagging strands toward the center and two leading strands out the sides. The single Pol -primase is centrally located and may prime both sister replisomes. The Ctf4-coupled-sister replisome model is consistent with cellular microscopy studies revealing two sister forks of an origin remain attached and are pushed forward from a protein platform.

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) cause yearly epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality. When zoonotic IAVs enter the human population, the viral hemagglutinin (HA) requires adaptation to achieve sustained virus transmission. In contrast, IBV has been circulating in humans, its only host, for a long period of time. Whether this entailed adaptation of IBV HA to the human airways is unknown. To address this question, we compared seasonal IAV (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and IBV viruses (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage) with regard to host-dependent activity of HA as the mediator of membrane fusion during viral entry. We first investigated proteolytic activation of HA, by covering all type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) and kallikrein enzymes, many of which proved present in human respiratory epithelium. Compared to IAV, the IBV HA0 precursor is cleaved by a broader panel of TTSPs and activated with much higher efficiency. Accordingly, knockdown of a single protease, TMPRSS2, was sufficient to abrogate spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial cells. Second, the HA fusion pH proved similar for IBV and human-adapted IAVs (one exception being HA of 1918 IAV). Third, IBV HA exhibited higher expression at 33{degrees}C, a temperature required for membrane fusion by B/Victoria HA. This indicates pronounced adaptation of IBV HA to the mildly acidic pH and cooler temperature of human upper airways. These distinct and intrinsic features of IBV HA are compatible with extensive host-adaptation during prolonged circulation of this respiratory virus in the human population.\\n\\nImportanceInfluenza epidemics are caused by influenza A (IAV) and influenza B (IBV) viruses. IBV causes substantial disease, however it is far less studied than IAV. While IAV originates from animal reservoirs, IBV circulates in humans only. Virus spread requires that the viral hemagglutinin (HA) is active and sufficiently stable in human airways. We here resolve how these mechanisms differ between IBV and IAV. Whereas human IAVs rely on one particular protease for HA activation, this is not the case for IBV. Superior activation of IBV by several proteases should enhance shedding of infectious particles. IBV HA exhibits acid-stability and a preference for 33{degrees}C, indicating pronounced adaptation to the human upper airways, where the pH is mildly acidic and a cooler temperature exists. These adaptive features are rationalized by the long existence of IBV in humans, and may have broader relevance for understanding the biology and evolution of respiratory viruses.",

These features may be intrinsic to the protein or induced by the presence of a partner.

To generalize this approach, we introduce a deep neural network architecture that transforms the raw atomic densities of each protein into complex three-dimensional representations. Each point in the volume containing the protein is described by 48 learned features, which are correlated and combined with the features of a second protein to produce a score dependent on the relative position and orientation of the two proteins. The architecture is based on multiple layers of SE(3)-equivariant convolutional neural networks, which provide built-in rotational and translational invariance of the score with respect to the structure of the complex.

Physiological, genetic, transcriptomics and bioinformatics analyses were integrated to study the salt stress adaptation response in bread wheat. A comparative analysis to uncover the dynamic transcriptomic response of contrasting genotypes from two wheat populations was performed at both osmotic and ionic phases in time points defined by physiologic measurements. The differential stress effect on the expression of photosynthesis, calcium binding and oxidative stress response genes in the contrasting genotypes supported the greater photosynthesis inhibition observed in the susceptible genotype at the osmotic phase. At the ionic phase genes involved in metal ion binding and transporter activity were up-regulated and down-regulated in the tolerant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. The stress effect on mechanisms related with protein synthesis and breakdown was identified at both stress phases. Based on the linkage disequilibrium blocks it was possible to select salt-responsive genes as potential components operating in the salt stress response pathways leading to salt stress resilience specific traits.

For part 1, evidence of entrainment or any influence of the embedding rhythm were examined on the stability or attractor location. The estimations from the dynamics of the relative phase between the two oscillations show that while (i) circadian effects under the artificially perturbed manipulation were not straightforward along the day-night temperature cycle, (ii) the circadian effect divided by the ordinary circadian seems to be constant along the day-night cycle. Corresponding to this evidence related to performance consequences depending on the organism and environmental interaction, the part 2 determined the impact of circadian (mis)alignment on biological functions and raised the possibility that the disruption of circadian systems may contribute to physical complications. The observations entail rules that self-attunement of current performance may develop not at a single component but across many nested, inter-connected scales. These inter-dependencies from different object phase may allow a potential context-dependent explanation for goal-oriented movements and the emergent assumption of a principle of organisms embedded into their environmental contexts.",

    "abstract": "Reindeer are semi-domesticated ruminants that have adapted to the challenging northern Eurasian environment characterized by long winters and marked annual fluctuations in daylight. We explored the genetic makeup behind their unique characteristics by de novo sequencing the genome of a male reindeer and conducted gene family analyses with nine other mammalian species. We performed a population genomics study of 23 additional reindeer representing both domestic and wild populations and several ecotypes from various geographic locations. We assembled 2.66 Gb (N50 scaffold of 5 Mb) of the estimated 2.92 Gb reindeer genome, comprising 27,332 genes. The results from the demographic history analysis suggested marked changes in the effective population size of reindeer during the Pleistocene period. We detected 160 reindeer-specific and expanded genes, of which zinc finger proteins (n=42) and olfactory receptors (n=13) were the most abundant. Comparative genome analyses revealed several genes that may have promoted the adaptation of reindeer, such as those involved in recombination and speciation (PRDM9), vitamin D metabolism (TRPV5, TRPV6), retinal development (PRDM1, OPN4B), circadian rhythm (GRIA1), immunity (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, IFNW1), tolerance to cold-triggered pain (SCN11A) and antler development (SILT2). The majority of these characteristic reindeer genes have been reported for the first time here. Moreover, our population genomics analysis suggested at least two independent reindeer domestication events with genetic lineages originating from different refugial regions after the Last Glacial Maximum. Taken together, our study has provided new insights into the domestication, evolution and adaptation of reindeer and has promoted novel genomic research of reindeer.",

    "abstract": "Botanists have long identified bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic) flowers with more specialized pollination interactions than radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) flowers. Zygomorphic flowers facilitate more precise contact with pollinators, guide pollinator behaviour, and exclude less effective pollinators. However, whether zygomorphic flowers are actually visited by a smaller subset of available pollinator species has not been broadly evaluated. We compiled 53,609 floral visitation records in 159 communities and classified the plants floral symmetry. Globally and within individual communities, plants with zygomorphic flowers are indeed visited by fewer species. At the same time, zygomorphic flowers share a somewhat larger proportion of their visitor species with other co-occurring plants, and have particularly high sharing with co-occurring plants that also have zygomorphic flowers. Visitation sub-networks for zygomorphic species also show differences that may arise from reduced visitor diversity, including greater connectance, greater web asymmetry, and lower coextinction robustness of both plants and visitor species -- but these changes do not necessarily translate to whole plant-visitor communities. These results provide context for widely documented associations between zygomorphy and diversification and imply that species with zygomorphic flowers may face greater risk of extinction due to pollinator loss.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDue to the recent advances in sequencing technologies and species tree estimation methods capable of taking gene tree discordance into account, notable progress has been achieved in constructing large scale phylogenetic trees from genome wide data. However, substantial challenges remain in leveraging this huge amount of molecular data. One of the foremost among these challenges is the need for efficient tools that can handle missing data. Popular distance-based methods such as neighbor joining and UPGMA require that the input distance matrix does not contain any missing values.\n\nResultsWe introduce two highly accurate machine learning based distance imputation techniques. One of our approaches is based on matrix factorization, and the other one is an autoencoder based deep learning technique. We evaluate these two techniques on a collection of simulated and biological datasets, and show that our techniques match or improve upon the best alternate techniques for distance imputation. Moreover, our proposed techniques can handle substantial amount of missing data, to the extent where the best alternate methods fail.\n\nConclusionsThis study shows for the first time the power and feasibility of applying deep learning techniques for imputing distance matrices. The autoencoder based deep learning technique is highly accurate and scalable to large dataset. We have made these techniques freely available as a cross-platform software (available at https://github.com/Ananya-Bhattacharjee/ImputeDistances).",

The main idea of this new software named \\\"Brazilian Mapping for Agricultural Zoning System\\\" (BRAMAZOS) is to transform scientific knowledge into useful information for crop climate risk management, indicating the risk of crop failure and which is the limiting meteorological element for the area unsuitability. The software was developed based on user experience design, focusing on the users facilities with a friendly interface. We simulated these fruits climate risk in current and future scenarios of climate change using ETAHadgem ES Regional Climate Models (RCM), which is a downscaling of the Global Climate Model HadGEM2-ES, based on the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5). We observed changes in the climate risk zone distribution for Persimmon and Papaya cultivation, which could lose almost 30% and 9% of the suitable area respectively. On the other hand, fig did not present significant reduction in the climate risk zone. The results presented here suggested that the temperate fruit examples used here seem to be more sensible to the temperature increase and, the tropical example seems to be more precipitation decrease sensitive. We discussed the significance of BRAMAZOS software as tool to support efficient information to climate risk management, providing agroclimatic information that are efficient to assist decision making, increase food security with the intention to reduce the climate impact on smallholders development and resources management issues.",

Specialised boundary cells form at segment borders that act as a source or regulator of neuronal differentiation. In zebrafish, there is spatial patterning of neurogenesis in which non-neurogenic zones form at bounderies and segment centres, in part mediated by Fgf20 signaling. To further understand the control of neurogenesis, we have carried out single cell RNA sequencing of the zebrafish hindbrain at three different stages of patterning. Analyses of the data reveal known and novel markers of distinct hindbrain segments, of cell types along the dorsoventral axis, and of the transition of progenitors to neuronal differentiation. We find major shifts in the transcriptome of progenitors and of differentiating cells between the different stages analysed. Supervised clustering with markers of boundary cells and segment centres, together with RNA-seq analysis of Fgf-regulated genes, has revealed new candidate regulators of cell differentiation in the hindbrain. These data provide a valuable resource for functional investigations of the patterning of neurogenesis and the transition of progenitors to neuronal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Domestication dramatically alters phenotypes. Standing variation among ancestral populations often drives phenotypic change during domestication, but some changes are caused by novel mutations. Dogs (Canis familiaris) engage in interspecific play with humans and it has specifically been suggested that the ability to interpret social-communicative behaviour expressed by humans is a novel dog-specific skill. Thus, wolves (Canis lupus) are not expected to engage in interspecific play with a human based on social-communicative cues. Here we report the observation of three eight week-old wolf puppies spontaneously responding to social-communicative behaviours from a stranger by retrieving a ball. This unexpected and novel observation has significant implications for our understanding and expectations of the genetic foundations of dog behaviour. Importantly, our observations indicate that behavioural responses to human social-communicative cues are not unique to dogs. This suggests that, while probably rare, standing variation in the expression of human-directed behaviour in ancestral populations could have been an important target for early selective pressures exerted during dog domestication.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence, a permanent state of replicative arrest in otherwise proliferating cells, is a hallmark of ageing and has been linked to ageing-related diseases like cancer. Senescent cells have been shown to accumulate in tissues of aged organisms which in turn can lead to chronic inflammation. Many genes have been associated with cell senescence, yet a comprehensive understanding of cell senescence pathways is still lacking. To this end, we created CellAge (http://genomics.senescence.info/cells), a manually curated database of 279 human genes associated with cellular senescence, and performed various integrative and functional analyses. We observed that genes promoting cell senescence tend to be overexpressed with age in human tissues and are also significantly overrepresented in anti-longevity and tumour-suppressor gene databases. By contrast, genes inhibiting cell senescence overlapped with pro-longevity genes and oncogenes. Furthermore, an evolutionary analysis revealed a strong conservation of senescence-associated genes in mammals, but not in invertebrates. Using the CellAge genes as seed nodes, we also built protein-protein interaction and co-expression networks. Clusters in the networks were enriched for cell cycle and immunological processes. Network topological parameters also revealed novel potential senescence-associated regulators. We then used siRNAs and observed that of 26 candidates tested, 19 induced markers of senescence. Overall, our work provides a new resource for researchers to study cell senescence and our systems biology analyses provide new insights and novel genes regarding cell senescence.",

    "abstract": "Giant Plasma Membrane Vesicles (GPMVs) are a widely used model system for biochemical and biophysical analysis of the isolated mammalian plasma membrane (PM). A core advantage of these vesicles is that they maintain the native lipid and protein diversity of the plasma membrane while affording the experimental flexibility of synthetic giant vesicles. In addition to fundamental investigations of PM structure and composition, GPMVs have been used to evaluate the binding of proteins and small molecules to cell-derived membranes, and the permeation of drug-like molecules through them. An important assumption of such experiments is that GPMVs are sealed; i.e. that permeation occurs by diffusion through the hydrophobic core rather than through hydrophilic pores. Here we demonstrate that this assumption is often incorrect. We find that most GPMVs isolated using standard preparations are passively permeable to various hydrophilic solutes as large as 40 kDa, in contrast to synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We attribute this leakiness to relatively large and heterogeneous pores formed by rupture of vesicles from cells. These pores are stable and persist throughout experimentally relevant time scales. Finally, we identify preparation conditions that minimize poration and allow evaluation of sealed GPMVs. These unexpected observations of GPMV poration are of critical importance for interpreting experiments utilizing GPMVs as plasma membrane models, particularly for drug permeation and membrane asymmetry.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEA critical assumption in using Giant Plasma Membrane Vesicles to study membrane penetration and interactions is that these vesicles maintain the permeability barrier of the native membrane from which they form. Using large fluorescently-labeled hydrophilic probes, we demonstrate that this assumption is often incorrect and conclude that macromolecular solutes permeate GPMVs through stable pores formed during shear-induced rupture of vesicles from cells. Using these insights into the mechanisms of poration, we demonstrate an approach to isolate sealed GPMVs.",

    "abstract": "The Kruppel-like Factors 4 and 2 (KLF4/2) are transcription factors and master regulators of endothelial cells (ECs) phenotype and homeostasis. KLF4/2 are important blood-flow-responsive genes within ECs that differentially regulate the expression of factors that confer anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and antiproliferative effects in ECs. Genetic inactivation of endothelial KRIT1 (Krev interaction trapped protein 1) or HEG1 (Heart of glass) lead to upregulation of KLF4/2 expression levels. Furthermore, increased expression of thrombomodulin (THBD) and suppression of thrombospondin (THBS1) was ascribed to elevation of KLF4/2 as a result of loss of endothelial KRIT1. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the HEG1-KRIT1 interaction and identified, HEG1-KRIT1 inhibitor 1 (HKi1), as a promising hit inhibitor. The crystal structure of HKi1 bound to the KRIT1 FERM domain confirmed the primary screening results and ultimately led to the identification of a fragment-like inhibitor (HKi3), which occupies the HEG1 pocket producing comparable activity. These findings suggest that these inhibitors block the interaction by competing with the HEG1 for binding to KRIT1 FERM domain. Moreover, our results demonstrate that HKi3 upregulates KLF4/2 gene expression in two types of human ECs. These results reveal that acute pharmacological inhibition of the HEG1-KRIT1 interaction rapidly induces expression of KLF4/2 and their important transcriptional targets thrombomodulin and thrombospondin.",

    "abstract": "Posttranslational protein modification by ubiquitin (Ub) is a central eukaryotic mechanism that regulates a plethora of physiological processes. Recent studies unveiled an unconventional type of ubiquitination mediated by the SidE family of Legionella pneumophila effectors, such as SdeA, that catalyzes the conjugation of Ub to a serine residue of target proteins via a phosphoribosyl linker (hence named PR-ubiquitination). Comparable to the deubiquitinases (DUBs) in the canonical ubiquitination pathway, here we show that two Legionella effectors, named DupA (deubiquitinase for PR-ubiquitination) and DupB, reverse PR-ubiquitination by specific removal of phosphoribosyl-Ub (PR-Ub) from substrates. Both DupA and DupB are fully capable of rescuing the Golgi fragmentation phenotype caused by exogenous expression of SdeA in mammalian cells. We further show that deletion of these two genes results in significant accumulation of PR-ubiquitinated species in host cells infected with Legionella. In addition, we have identified a list of specific PR-ubiquitinated host targets and show that DupA and DupB play a role in modulating the association of PR-ubiquitinated host targets with Legionella containing vacuoles (LCV). Together, our data establish a complete PR-ubiquitination and deubiquitination cycle and demonstrate the intricate control that Legionella has over this unusual Ub-dependent posttranslational modification.\\n\\nStatement of significanceUbiquitination is a vital posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. A variety of microbial pathogens exploit this pathway during their infection. Legionella pneumophila, the causative bacterial pathogen of Legionnaires disease, has been show to hijack host ubiquitination pathway via a large number of effectors. Recent studies revealed a family of effectors catalyzing a novel type of Ub-dependent posttranslational modification, namely PR-ubiquitination. Here we report two new players, DupA and DupB, involved in this unconventional pathway. We found that DupA and DupB function as PR-Ub specific DUBs and play a role in regulating the PR-ubiquitination levels of host targets.

    "abstract": "mRNA levels are determined by the balance between mRNA synthesis and decay. Factors that mediate both processes, including the 5 to 3 exonuclease Xrn1, are responsible for the cross talk between the two processes in a manner that buffers steady-state mRNA levels. However, these proteins roles in transcription remain elusive and controversial. Applying NET-seq to yeast cells, we show that Xrn1 functions mainly as a transcriptional activator and that its disruption manifests via the reduction of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy downstream of transcription start sites. We combine our data and novel mathematical modeling of transcription to suggest that transcription initiation and elongation of targeted genes is modulated by Xrn1. Furthermore, Pol II occupancy markedly increases near cleavage and polyadenylation sites in xrn1{Delta} cells while its activity decreases, a characteristic feature of backtracked Pol II. We also provide indirect evidence that Xrn1 is involved in transcription termination downstream of polyadenylation sites. Two additional decay factors, Dhh1 and Lsm1, seem to function similarly to Xrn1 in transcription, perhaps as a complex, while the decay factors Ccr4 and Rpb4 also perturb transcription in other ways. Interestingly, DFs are capable of differentiating between SAGA- and TFIID-dominated promoters. These two classes of genes respond differently to XRN1 deletion in mRNA synthesis and differentially utilize mRNA decay pathways, raising the possibility that one distinction between the two types of genes lies in the mechanism(s) that balance these processes.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWhether immunotherapy improves long-term disability in multiple sclerosis has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. This study examined the effect of immunotherapy on long-term disability outcomes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\\n\\nMethodsWe studied patients from MSBase followed for [&ge;]1 year, with [&ge;]3 visits, [&ge;]1 visit per year and exposed to a multiple sclerosis therapy, and a subset of patients with [&ge;]15-year follow-up. Marginal structural models were used to compare the hazard of 12-month confirmed increase and decrease in disability, EDSS step 6 and the incidence of relapses between treated and untreated periods. Marginal structural models were continuously re-adjusted for patient age, sex, pregnancy, date, disease course, time from first symptom, prior relapse history, disability and MRI activity.\\n\\nResults14,717 patients were studied. During the treated periods, patients were less likely to experience relapses (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.82, p=0.0016), worsening of disability (0.56, 0.38-0.82, p=0.0026) and progress to EDSS step 6 (0.33, 0.19-0.59, p=0.00019). Among 1085 patients with [&ge;]15-year follow-up, the treated patients were less likely to experience relapses (0.59, 0.50-0.70, p=10-9) and worsening of disability (0.81, 0.67-0.99, p=0.043).\\n\\nConclusionsContinued treatment with multiple sclerosis immunotherapies reduces disability accrual (by 19-44%), the risk of need of a walking aid by 67% and the frequency of relapses (by 40-41%) over 15 years. A proof of long-term effect of immunomodulation on disability outcomes is the key to establishing its disease modifying properties.",

    "abstract": "Transferrin is an attractive candidate for drug delivery due to its ability to cross the blood brain barrier. However, in order to be able to use it for therapeutic purposes, it is important to investigate how its stability depends on different formulation conditions. Combining high-throughput thermal and chemical denaturation studies with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it was possible to connect the stability of transferrin with its conformational changes. The release of iron induces opening of transferrin, which results in a negative effect on its stability. Presence of NaCl, arginine, and histidine leads to opening of the transferrin N-lobe and has a negative impact on the overall protein stability.\\n\\nStatement of significanceProtein-based therapeutics have become an essential part of medical treatment. They are highly specific, have high affinity and fewer off-target effects. However, stabilization of proteins is critical, time-consuming, and expensive, and it is not yet possible to predict the behavior of proteins under different conditions. The current work is focused on a molecular understanding of the stability of human serum transferrin; a protein which is abundant in blood serum, may pass the blood brain barrier and therefore with high potential in drug delivery. Combination of high throughput unfolding techniques and structural studies, using small angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamic simulation, allows us to understand the behavior of transferrin on a molecular level.",

    "abstract": "Eating disorders and substance use disorders frequently co-occur. Twin studies reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa (BN) and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [rg], twin-based=0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge-eating, AN without binge-eating, and a BN factor score), and eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Total sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2,400 to ~537,000 individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder and substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN (rg=0.18; false discovery rate q=0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN (rg=0.23; q<0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge-eating (rg=0.27; q=0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic correlations were observed between three non-diagnostic smoking phenotypes (smoking initiation, current smoking, and cigarettes per day) and AN without binge-eating (rgs=-0.19 to -0.23; qs<0.04). The genetic correlation between AUD and AN was no longer significant after co-varying for MDD loci. The patterns of association between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes highlights the potentially complex and substance-specific relationships between these behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The electroencephalogram (EEG) of schizophrenia patients is known to exhibit a reduction of signal-to-noise ratio and of phase locking, as well as a facilitation of excitability, in response to a variety of external stimuli. Here we demonstrate these effects in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials and in the resting-state EEG. To ensure veracity we used three weekly sessions and analyzed both resting state and TMS-EEG data. For the TMS responses our analysis verifies known results. For the resting state we introduce the methodology of mean-normalized variation to the EEG analysis (quartile-based coefficient of variation), which allows for a comparison of narrow-band EEG amplitude fluctuations to narrow-band Gaussian noise. This reveals that amplitude fluctuations in the delta, alpha and beta bands of healthy controls are different from those in schizophrenia patients, on time scales of tens of seconds. We conclude that the EEG-measured cortical activity patterns of schizophrenia patients are more similar to noise, both in alpha and beta resting state and in TMS responses. Our results suggest that the ability of neuronal populations to form stable, locally and temporally correlated activity is reduced in schizophrenia, a conclusion that is in accord with previous experiments on TMS-EEG and on resting-state EEG.",

But still, some of the mechanisms how distinct stimuli are detected and transduced are not entirely understood. Over the past decade major progress has increased our understanding in areas such as mechanotransduction or sensory neuron classification. Additionally, the accessibility to human pluripotent stem cells and the possibility to generate and study human sensory neurons has enriched the somatosensory research field.\\n\\nBased on our previous work, the generation of functional human mechanoreceptors, we describe here the generation of hESC-derived nociceptor-like cells. We show that by varying the differentiation strategy, we can produce different nociceptive subpopulations. One protocol in particular allowed the generation of a sensory neuron population, homogeneously expressing TRPV1, a prototypical marker for nociceptors. Accordingly, we find the cells to homogenously respond to capsaicin, to become sensitized upon inflammatory stimuli, and to respond to temperature stimulation.\\n\\nSurprisingly, all of the generated subtypes show mechano-nociceptive characteristics and, quite unexpectedly, loss of mechanotransduction in the absence of PIEZO2.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) disproportionately affects females with steeper cognitive decline and more neuropathology compared to males, which is exacerbated in females carrying the APOE{varepsilon}4 allele. The risk of developing AD is also higher in female APOE{varepsilon}4 carriers in earlier age groups (aged 65-75), and the progression from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to AD may be influenced by sex. Inflammation is observed in AD and is related to aging, stress, and neuroplasticity, and although studies are scarce, sex differences are noted in inflammation. The objective of this study was to investigate underlying physiological inflammatory mechanisms that may help explain why there are sex differences in AD and APOE{varepsilon}4 carriers. We investigated, using the ADNI database, the effect of sex and APOE genotype (non-carriers or carriers of 1 and 2 APOE{varepsilon}4 alleles) and sex and diagnosis (cognitively normal (CN), MCI, AD) on CSF (N= 279) and plasma (N= 527) markers of stress and inflammation. We found CSF IL-16 and IL-8 levels were significantly lower in female non-carriers of APOE{varepsilon}4 alleles compared to males, whereas levels were similar between the sexes among carriers of APOE{varepsilon}4 alleles. Furthermore, females had on average higher levels of plasma CRP and ICAM1 but lower levels of CSF ICAM1, IL-8, IL-16, and IgA than males. Carrying APOE{varepsilon}4 alleles and diagnosis (MCI and AD) decreased plasma CRP in both sexes. Sex differences in inflammatory biomarkers support that the underlying physiological changes during aging differ by sex and tissue origin.",

In the present study, we wanted to gain further insight into the roles of desmin which expression is increased in the muscle from the mouse Mdx DMD model. We show that a deletion of the desmin gene (Des) in Mdx mice (DKO, Mdx:desmin-/-) induces a marked worsening of the weakness (reduced maximal force production) as compared to Mdx mice. Fragility (higher susceptibility to contraction-induced injury) was also aggravated and fatigue resistance was reduced in DKO mice. Moreover, in contrast to Mdx mice, the DKO mice did not undergo a muscle hypertrophy because of smaller and less numerous fibers, with reduced percentage of centronucleated fibres. Interestingly, Desmin cDNA transfer with adeno-associated virus in 1-month-old DKO mice and newborn Mdx mice improved muscle weakness. Overall, desmin plays important and beneficial roles on muscle performance, fragility and remodelling in dystrophic Mdx mice.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of a specific cell fate is one of the core aims of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Significant evidence shows that aggregate cultures have a positive influence on fate decisions, presumably through cell-cell interactions, but little is known about the specific mechanisms. To investigate the difference between cells cultured as a monolayer and as aggregates, we started by looking at cadherin expression, an important protein involved in cell adhesion, during the differentiation of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in aggregate and monolayer cultures. We observed that proliferating hMSCs in monolayer culture express cadherin-2 and undergo a switch to cadherin-11 over time, which was not evident in the aggregate cultures. By knocking down cadherin-2 and cadherin-11, we found that both cadherins were required for adipogenic differentiation in a monolayer as well as aggregate culture. However, during osteogenic differentiation, low levels of cadherin-2 were found to be favorable for cells cultured as a monolayer and as aggregates, whereas cadherin-11 was dispensable for cells cultured as aggregates. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for the important role that cadherins play in regulating the differentiation of hMSCs and how this is affected by the dimensionality of cell culture.",

    "abstract": "Traction forces are generated by cellular actin-myosin system and transmitted to the environment through adhesions. They are believed to drive cell motion, shape changes, and extracellular matrix remodeling [1-3]. However, most of the traction force analysis has been performed on stationary cells, investigating forces at the level of individual focal adhesions or linking them to static cell parameters such as area and edge curvature [4-10]. It is not well understood how traction forces are related to shape changes and motion, e.g. forces were reported to either increase or drop prior to cell retraction [11-15]. Here, we analyze the dynamics of traction forces during the protrusion-retraction cycle of polarizing fish epidermal keratocytes and find that forces fluctuate in concert with the cycle, increasing during the protrusion phase and reaching maximum at the beginning of retraction. We relate force dynamics to the recently discovered phenomenological rule [16] that governs cell edge behavior during keratocyte polarization: both traction forces and the probability of switch from protrusion to retraction increase with the distance from the cell center. Diminishing traction forces with cell contractility inhibitor leads to decreased edge fluctuations and abnormal polarization, while externally applied force can induce protrusion-retraction switch. These results suggest that forces mediate distance-sensitivity of the edge dynamics and ultimately organize cell-edge behavior leading to spontaneous polarization. Actin flow rate did not exhibit the same distance-dependence as traction stress, arguing against its role in organizing edge dynamics. Finally, using a simple model of actin-myosin network, we show that force-distance relationship may be an emergent feature of such networks.",

Despite ca. seven decades of theoretical elaboration aiming to explain the problem since Medawar first outlined it, we argue that this fundamental problem of biology remains unsolved. Here, we utilise demographic information2, 3 for 308 multicellular species to derive age-based trajectories of mortality and reproduction that provide evidence against the predictions of the classical, still prevailing, theories of ageing1, 4, 5, 6. These theories predict the inescapability of senescence1, 4, or its universality at least among species with a clear germ-soma barrier5, 6. The patterns of senescence in animals and plants that we report contradict both of these predictions. With the largest ageing comparative dataset of these characteristics to date, we build on recent evidence7, 8 to show that senescence is not the rule, and highlight the discrepancy between existing evidence and theory7, 8, 9. We also show that species age patterns of mortality and reproduction often follow divergent patterns, suggesting that organisms may display senescence for one component but not the other. We propose that ageing research will benefit from widening its classical theories beyond merely individual chronological age; key life history traits such as size, the ecology of the organism, and kin selection, may together play a hidden, yet integral role in shaping senescence outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a critical tool in the surveillance of the pathogen and development and evaluation of vaccines. Whole-genome DNA sequencing and analysis is becoming increasingly common and is an effective method for pneumococcal serotype identification of pure isolates. However, because of the complexities of the pneumococcal capsular loci, current analysis software requires samples to be pure (or nearly pure) and only contain a single pneumococcal serotype. We introduce a new software tool called SeroCall, which can identify and quantitate the serotypes present in samples, even when several serotypes are present. The sample preparation, library preparation and sequencing follow standard laboratory protocols. The software runs as fast or faster than existing identification tools on typical computing servers and is freely available under an open source license at https://github.com/knightjimr/serocall. Using samples with known concentrations of different serotypes as well as blinded samples, we were able to accurately quantify the abundance of different serotypes of pneumococcus in mixed cultures, with 100% accuracy for detecting the major serotype and up to 86% accuracy for detecting minor serotypes. We were also able to track changes in serotype frequency over time in an experimental setting. This approach could be applied in both epidemiologic field studies of pneumococcal colonization as well as in experimental lab studies and could provide a cheaper and more efficient method for serotyping than alternative approaches.",

    "abstract": "Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is often elevated in cancers, and exists in alternative states of phosphorylation. A motif centered on PGRMC1 Y180 was evolutionarily acquired concurrently with the embryological gastrulation organizer that orchestrates vertebrate tissue differentiation. Here, we show that mutagenic manipulation of PGRMC1 phosphorylation alters cell metabolism, genomic stability, and CpG methylation. Each of several mutants elicited distinct patterns of genomic CpG methylation. Mutation of S57A/Y180/S181A led to increased net hypermethylation, reminiscent of embryonic stem cells. Pathways enrichment analysis suggested modulation of processes related to animal cell differentiation status and tissue identity, as well as cell cycle control and ATM/ATR DNA damage repair regulation. We detected different genomic mutation rates in culture. A companion manuscript shows that these cell states dramatically affect protein abundances, cell and mitochondrial morphology, and glycolytic metabolism. We propose that PGRMC1 phosphorylation status modulates cellular plasticity mechanisms relevant to early embryological tissue differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In primates and most carnivores, neurons in primary visual cortex are spatially organized by their functional properties. For example, neurons with similar orientation preferences are grouped together in iso-orientation domains that smoothly vary over the cortical sheet. In rodents, on the other hand, neurons with different orientation preferences are thought to be spatially intermingled, a feature which has been termed \\\"salt-and-pepper\\\" organization. The apparent absence of any systematic structure in orientation tuning has been considered a defining feature of the rodent visual system for more than a decade, with broad implications for brain development, visual processing, and comparative neurophysiology. Here, we revisited this question using new techniques for wide-field two-photon calcium imaging that enabled us to collect nearly complete population tuning preferences in layers 2-4 across a large fraction of the mouse visual hierarchy. Examining the orientation tuning of these hundreds of thousands of neurons, we found a global map spanning multiple visual cortical areas in which orientation bias was organized around a single pinwheel centered in V1. This pattern was consistent across animals and cortical depth. The existence of this global organization in rodents has implications for our understanding of visual processing and the principles governing the ontogeny and phylogeny of the visual cortex of mammals.",

    "abstract": "Chronic loss of sleep damages health and disturbs quality of life. The long-lasting sleep deprivation (SD) as well as sleep abnormalities is a substantial risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD), although the underlying mechanisms are not clear. In our previous studies, we report the activation of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome induced by long-term SD is P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) dependent, and antidepressant fluoxetine could alleviate this neuroinflammasome via 5-HT2B receptors (5-HT2BR) in astrocytes. Here, we discovered that the chronic SD activates astroglial P2X7 receptors, which in turn selectively down-regulated expression of 5-HT2BR in astrocytes. Stimulation of P2X7R induced by SD suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT and FoxO3a selectively in astrocytes, but not in neurones. The over-expression of FoxO3a in astrocytes inhibited expression of 5-HT2BR. Down-regulation of 5-HT2BR instigated by SD suppressed activation of STAT3 and relieved the inhibition of Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). This latter cascade promoted the release of arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The depressive-like behaviours induced by SD were alleviated in P2X7R-KO mice. Our study reveals the mechanism underlying chronic SD-induced depressive-like behaviors and highlights that blocking P2X7 receptors or activating 5-HT2BR in astrocytes could play a key role for exploring the therapeutic strategies aimed at the depression evoked by sleep disorders.\\n\\nMain PointsChronic SD selectively down-regulates expression of 5-HT2BR through activation of P2X7R in astrocytes.

    "abstract": "Although the underlying molecular mechanism of unloading-induced bone loss has been broadly elucidated, the pathophysiological role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this process is unknown. Here, we identified a novel lncRNA, OGRU, a 1816-nucleotide transcript with significantly decreased levels in bone specimens from hindlimb-unloaded mice and in MC3T3-E1 cells under clinorotation unloading conditions. OGRU overexpression promoted osteoblast activity and matrix mineralization under normal loading conditions and attenuated the suppression of MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation induced by clinorotation unloading. Furthermore, this study found that supplementation of pcDNA3.1(+)-OGRU via (DSS)6-liposome delivery to the bone formation surfaces of hindlimb-unloaded (HLU) mice partially alleviated unloading-induced bone loss. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that OGRU can function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to facilitate the protein expression of Hoxa10 by competitively binding miR-320-3p and subsequently promote osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Taken together, the results of our study provide the first clarification of the role of the OGRU in unloading-induced bone loss through the miR-320-3p/Hoxa10 axis, suggesting an efficient anabolic strategy for osteoporosis treatment.",

    "abstract": "Summary Marker pigments are used as a proxy for biomass of distinct phytoplankton classes in different oceanic regions. However, sometimes disagreements are observed between microscopy and accessory-pigment based approaches in distinct regions mainly due to changing environmental factors governing diversity and structure of community composition. In this study, concordance between microscopy and HPLC-CHEMTAX methods were investigated first time in coastal waters of Erdemli, Turkey, in the Levantin Basin of the northeastern Mediterranean Sea by weekly intervals during 2015-2016. According to our results, marker pigment of diatoms, fucoxanthin, which was the most prominent pigment in the study area during most of the year, was a better indicator of diatom abundance than diatom carbon biomass. CHEMTAX derived values of diatom chlorophyll a (Chl a) were not in concert with either abundance or carbon biomass of this group. Contribution of dinoflagellates and cryptophytes to the phytoplankton community was underestimated with pigment based approach. Accessory pigment of cyanophytes, zeaxanthin, was also an important pigment in the samples. Biomass of haptophytes seemed to be overestimated by HPLC-CHEMTAX analysis. In contrast to diatoms, CHEMTAX derived chlorophyll a values of cryptophytes were correlated with abundance of this group but not with alloxanthin. Inclusion of live counts of nanoplanktic cryptophytes, haptophytes and prasinophytes provided a better correlation between microscopy and pigment based results. According to CHEMTAX analysis, nanoplankton and picoplankton constituted [~]55% of Chl a in the region.",

    "abstract": "Most existing cancer treatments involve high-cost chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with major side effects, prompting effort to develop alternative treatment modalities. In this study, we propose a novel non-invasive treatment calling for exposure of cells to CGA, coupled with thermal-cycling hyperthermia (TC-HT) and low-intensity pulsed electric field (LIPEF). The study finds that this triple combination can significantly impede the proliferation of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells, with only about 20% viable cells left after 24h, whereas being non-toxic to normal cells. The synergistic activity against the PANC-1 cells was achieved by inducing G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, which were associated with up-regulation of p53 and coupled with increased expression of downstream proteins p21 and Bax. Further mechanism investigations revealed that the cytotoxic activity could be related to mitochondrial apoptosis, characterized by the reduced level of Bcl-2, mitochondrial dysfunction, and sequential activation of caspase-9 and PARP. Also, we found that the triple treatment led to the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Notably, the triple treatment-induced cytotoxic effects and the elevated expression of p53 and p21 proteins as well as the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, all could be alleviated by the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). These findings indicate that the combination of CGA, TC-HT, and LIPEF may be a promising modality for cancer treatment, as it can induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through accumulation of ROS in PANC-1 cells.",

We show that this putative Gq-inhibiting pepducin lacks inhibitory effects on signaling downstream of the Gq-coupled receptors for ATP (P2Y2R) and PAF (PAFR) expressed in human neutrophils. P4Pal10 inhibited however, signaling in neutrophils activated with agonists for the Gi-coupled formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) but not the closely related FPR1. In addition, the P4Pal10 pepducin was turned into an activating agonist in the presence of an allosteric modulator selective for free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2R). The results presented thus reveal Gq-independent effects of P4Pal10 in modulating FPR2- and FFA2R-mediated neutrophil activation.",
