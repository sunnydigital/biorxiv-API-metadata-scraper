    "abstract": "Bacteriophage lambda makes a decision between lysis and lysogeny based on the number of coinfecting phages, namely the multiplicity of infection (MoI): lysis at low MoIs; lysogeny at high MoIs. Here, by evaluating various rationally designed models on their ability a) to make the lytic decision at MoI of 1 and the lysogeny decision at MoI of 2, b) to exhibit bistability at both MoIs, and c) to perform accurately in the presence of noise, it is demonstrated that lambdas lysis/lysogeny decision is based on three features, namely a) mutual repression, b) cooperative positive autoregulation of CI, and c) cooperative binding of the activator protein, not basal expression, triggering positive autoregulatory loop of CI. Cro and CI are sufficient to acquire the first two features. CII is required to acquire the third feature. The quasi-minimal two-protein model for the switch is justified by showing its qualitative equivalence, except for Cro repression of pRM, to the lambdas gene regulatory network responsible for the decision. A three-protein simplified version of the lambdas switch is shown to possess all the three design features. Bistability at MoI of 1 is responsible for lysogen stability, whereas bistability at MoI of 2 imparts stability to lytic development post-infection and especially during prophage induction.",

    "abstract": "Spermatozoa of marine invertebrates are attracted to their conspecific female gamete by diffusive molecules, called chemoattractants, released from the egg investments in a process known as chemotaxis. The information from the egg chemoattractant concentration field is decoded into intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes that regulate the internal motors that shape the flagellum as it beats. By studying sea urchin species-specific differences in sperm chemoattractant-receptor characteristics we show that receptor density constrains the steepness of the chemoattractant concentration gradient detectable by spermatozoa. Through analyzing different chemoattractant gradient forms, we demonstrate for the first time that Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sperm are chemotactic and this response is consistent with frequency entrainment of two coupled physiological oscillators: i) the stimulus function and ii) the [Ca2+]i changes. We demonstrate that the slope of the chemoattractant gradients provides the coupling force between both oscillators, arising as a fundamental requirement for sperm chemotaxis.",

    "abstract": "Polarised targeting of diverse mRNAs to motile cellular protrusions is a hallmark of cell migration1-3. Although a widespread phenomenon, definitive functions for endogenous targeted mRNAs and their relevance to modulation of in-vivo tissue dynamics remain elusive. Here, using single-molecule analysis, endogenous gene-edited mRNAs and zebrafish in-vivo live-cell imaging, we report that mRNA polarisation acts as a molecular compass that orients motile cell polarity and spatially directs tissue movement. Clustering of protrusion-derived RNAseq datasets defined a core 192 bp localisation element underpinning precise mRNA targeting to incipient sites of filopodia formation at cell protrusions. Such targeting of the small GTPase, RAB13, generated tight spatial coupling of mRNA localisation, translation and protein activity, achieving precise subcellular compartmentalisation of RAB13 protein function to create a polarised domain of filopodia extension. Consequently, genomic excision of this localisation element and specific perturbation of endogenous RAB13 targeting - but not translation - depolarised filopodial dynamics in motile endothelial cells and induced miss-patterning of nascent blood vessels in-vivo. Hence, mRNA polarisation, not expression, is the primary spatial determinant of the site of RAB13 action, preventing ectopic functionality at inappropriate subcellular loci and orienting tissue morphogenesis. Considering the unexpected spatial diversity of other polarised mRNA clusters we identified, mRNA-mediated compartmentalisation of protein function at distinct subcellular sites likely coordinates broad aspects of in-vivo tissue behaviour.",

Forces transmit to the nucleus through the Linker of Nucleo- and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex and are thought to influence the organization of chromatin that is related to cell differentiation; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated chromatin reorganization during murine cardiac development and found that cardiomyocytes establish a distinct architecture characterized by relocation of H3K9me3-modified chromatin from the nuclear interior to the periphery and co-localization to myofibrils. This effect was abrogated in stiff environments that inhibited cardiomyocyte contractility, or after LINC complex disruption, and resulted in the relocation of H3K27me3-modified chromatin instead. By generating high-resolution intra-nuclear strain maps during cardiomyocyte contraction, we discovered that the reorganization of H3K9me3-marked chromatin is influenced by tensile, but not compressive, nuclear strains. Our findings highlight a new role for nuclear mechanosensation in guiding cell fate through chromatin reorganization in response to environmental cues.",

Behavioral responses to novel stimuli, or exploratory behavior, can differ strongly between closely related species; however, the ecological and evolutionary factors underlying these differences are not well understood, in part because most comparative investigations have focused on only two species. In this study, we investigate exploratory behavior across 23 species in a previously untested vertebrate system, Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, which comprises hundreds of phenotypically diverse species that have diverged in the past one million years. We investigate behavioral variation across species, across microhabitats, and across environmental contexts. We find strong species differences in behavior that are associated with microhabitat, demonstrate that intermediate microhabitats are associated with higher levels of exploratory behavior, show that patterns of behavioral covariation across contexts are characteristic of modular complex traits, and contrast Malawi cichlid data with behavioral data from selectively bred high-and low-exploratory zebrafish. Taken together, our results tie ecology to species differences in behavior, and highlight Lake Malawi cichlids as a powerful system for understanding the evolution, ecology, and biology of natural behavioral variation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMalawi cichlids exhibit high phenotypic variance in exploratory behaviors\nC_LIO_LISpecies differences in exploratory behavior are explained by microhabitat\nC_LIO_LIRock-dwelling species exhibit strong edge preferences across assays\nC_LIO_LIIntermediate habitats are associated with \"high exploratory\" open field behavior\nC_LIO_LIPatterns of behavioral covariance across contexts are modular in Malawi cichlids\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cancer is the most complex genetic disease known, with mutations implicated in more than 250 genes. However, it is still elusive which specific mutations found in human patients lead to tumorigenesis. Here we show that a combination of oncogenes that is characteristic of liver cancer (CTNNB1, TERT, MYC) induces senescence in human fibroblasts and primary hepatocytes. However, reprogramming fibroblasts to a liver progenitor fate, induced hepatocytes (iHeps), makes them sensitive to transformation by the same oncogenes. The transformed iHeps are highly proliferative, tumorigenic in nude mice, and bear gene expression signatures of liver cancer. These results show that tumorigenesis is triggered by a combination of three elements: the set of driver mutations, the cellular lineage, and the state of differentiation of the cells along the lineage. Our results provide direct support for the role of cell identity as a key determinant in transformation, and establish a paradigm for studying the dynamic role of oncogenic drivers in human tumorigenesis.",

However, the entry, dispersal, and detection of terrestrial species DNA within waterbodies is understudied.\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluated eDNA metabarcoding of pond water for monitoring semi-aquatic, ground-dwelling, and arboreal mammals, and examined spatiotemporal variation in mammal eDNA signals using experiments in captive and wild conditions.\nC_LIO_LIWe selected nine focal species of conservation and management concern: European water vole, European otter, Eurasian beaver, European hedgehog, European badger, red deer, Eurasian lynx, red squirrel, and European pine marten. We hypothesised that eDNA signals (i.e. proportional read counts) would be stronger for semi-aquatic than terrestrial species, and at sites where mammals exhibited behaviours (e.g. swimming, urination). We tested this by sampling waterbodies in enclosures of captive focal species at specific sites where behaviours had been observed ( directed sampling) and at equidistant intervals along the shoreline ( stratified sampling). We then surveyed natural ponds (N = 6) where focal species were present using stratified water sampling, camera traps, and field signs. eDNA samples were metabarcoded using vertebrate-specific primers.\nC_LIO_LIAll focal species were detected in captivity. eDNA signal strength did not differ between directed and stratified samples across or within species, between species lifestyles (i.e. semi-aquatic, ground-dwelling, arboreal), or according to behaviours. Therefore, eDNA was evenly distributed within artificial waterbodies. Conversely, eDNA was unevenly distributed in natural ponds. eDNA metabarcoding, camera trapping, and field signs detected beaver, red deer, and roe deer. Badger and red fox were recorded with cameras and field signs, but not eDNA metabarcoding. However, eDNA metabarcoding detected small mammals missed by cameras and field signs, e.g. water vole. Terrestrial mammal eDNA signals were weaker and detected in fewer samples than semi-aquatic mammal eDNA signals.\nC_LIO_LIeDNA metabarcoding has potential for inclusion in mammal monitoring schemes by enabling large-scale, multi-species distribution assessment for priority and difficult to survey species, and could provide early indication of range expansions or contractions. However, eDNA surveys need high spatiotemporal resolution and metabarcoding biases require further investigation before this tool is routinely implemented.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Excitatory synaptic transmission in many neurons is mediated by two co-expressed ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes, AMPA and NMDA receptors, that differ in their kinetics, ion-selectivity, and voltage-sensitivity. AMPA receptors have fast kinetics and are voltage-insensitive, while NMDA receptors have slower kinetics and increased conductance at depolarized membrane potentials. Here we report that the voltage-dependency and kinetics of NMDA receptors act synergistically to stabilize synaptic integration of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) across spatial and voltage domains. Simulations of synaptic integration in simplified and morphologically realistic dendritic trees revealed that the combined presence of AMPA and NMDA conductances reduces the variability of somatic responses to spatiotemporal patterns of excitatory synaptic input presented at different initial membrane potentials and/or in different dendritic domains. This moderating effect of the NMDA conductance on synaptic integration was robust across a wide range of AMPA-to-NMDA ratios, and results from synergistic interaction of NMDA kinetics (which reduces variability across membrane potential) and voltage-dependence (which favors stabilization across dendritic location). When combined with AMPA conductance, the NMDA conductance balances voltage- and impedance-dependent changes in synaptic driving force, and distance-dependent attenuation of synaptic potentials arriving at the axon, to increase the fidelity of synaptic integration and EPSP-spike coupling across neuron state (i.e., initial membrane potential) and dendritic location of synaptic input. Thus, synaptic NMDA receptors convey advantages for synaptic integration that are independent of, but fully compatible with, their importance for coincidence detection and synaptic plasticity.\n\nSignificance StatementGlutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that, at many synapses, gates two coexpressed receptor subtypes (AMPA and NMDA receptors). Computational simulations reveal that the combined synaptic presence of AMPA and NMDA receptors reduces variability in synaptic integration in response to identical patterns of synaptic input delivered to different dendritic locations and/or at different initial membrane potentials. This results from synergistic interaction of the slower kinetics and voltage-dependence of NMDA receptors, which combine to enhance synaptic currents when synaptic driving forces are otherwise reduced (e.g., at depolarized membrane potentials or in distal, high-impedance dendrites). By stabilizing synaptic integration across dendritic location and initial membrane potential, NMDA receptors provide advantages independent of, but fully compatible with, their well-known contribution to synaptic plasticity.",

When people monitor a rapid stream of visual items for two targets, they can typically report the first, but not the second target, if these appear within 200-500 ms of each other, a phenomenon known as the attentional blink (AB). No work has determined the neural basis for the AB, partly because conventional neuroimaging approaches lack the temporal resolution to adequately characterise the neural activity elicited by each item in a rapid stream. Here we introduce a new approach that can identify the precise effect of the AB on behaviour and neural activity. Specifically, we employed a multivariate encoding approach to extract feature-selective information carried by randomly-oriented gratings within a rapid serial stream. We show that feature selectivity is enhanced for correctly reported targets and suppressed when the same items are missed. By contrast, no such effects were apparent for irrelevant distractor items. Our findings point to a new theoretical account that involves both short- and long-range temporal interactions between visual items competing for consciousness.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes an ER-resident glycoprotein, UL148, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) but is fully dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells. Hence, its previously ascribed roles in immune evasion and modulation of viral cell tropism are hypothesized to cause ER stress. Here, we show that UL148 is necessary and sufficient to drive the formation of large ER-derived structures that occupy up to 7% of the infected cell cytosol. The structures are found to be sites where UL148 coalesces with cellular proteins involved in ER quality control, such as Hrd1 and EDEM1. Transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal the structures to be comprised of tortuous, densely packed and apparently collapsed ER membranes that connect to distended cisternae. During induced ectopic expression of UL148-GFP fusion protein, punctate signals traffic to accumulate at prominent structures that exhibit poor recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching. Small molecule blockade of the integrated stress response (ISR) prevents the formation of puncta, leading to a uniform reticular fluorescent signal. Accordingly, ISR inhibition during HCMV infection abolishes the coalescence of UL148 and Hrd1 into discrete structures, which argues that UL148 requires the ISR to cause ER reorganization. Given that UL148 stabilizes immature forms of a receptor binding subunit for a viral envelope glycoprotein complex important for HCMV infectivity, our results imply that stress-dependent ER remodeling contributes to viral cell tropism.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPerturbations to ER morphology occur during infection with various intracellular pathogens and in certain genetic disorders. We identify that an HCMV gene product, UL148, profoundly reorganizes the ER during infection, and is sufficient to do so when expressed on its own. Our results reveal that UL148-dependent reorganization of the ER is a prominent feature of HCMV infected cells. Moreover, we find that this example of virally induced organelle remodeling requires the integrated stress response (ISR), a stress adaptation pathway that contributes to a number of disease states. Since ER reorganization accompanies the roles of UL148 in HCMV cell tropism and intracellular retention of the immune cell co-stimulatory ligand CD58, our results may have implications for understanding the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, our findings provide a basis to utilize UL148 as a tool to investigate organelle responses to stress and to identify novel drugs targeting the ISR.",

    "abstract": "Estimating past population dynamics from molecular sequences that have been sampled longitudinally through time is an important problem in infectious disease epidemiology, molecular ecology and macroevolution. Popular solutions, such as the skyline and skygrid methods, infer past effective population sizes from the coalescent event times of phylogenies reconstructed from sampled sequences, but assume that sequence sampling times are uninformative about population size changes. Recent work has started to question this assumption by exploring how sampling time information can aid coalescent inference. Here we develop, investigate, and implement a new skyline method, termed the epoch sampling skyline plot (ESP), to jointly estimate the dynamics of population size and sampling rate through time. The ESP is inspired by real-world data collection practices and comprises a flexible model in which the sequence sampling rate is proportional to the population size within an epoch but can change discontinuously between epochs. We show that the ESP is accurate under several realistic sampling protocols and we prove analytically that it can at least double the best precision achievable by standard approaches. We generalise the ESP to incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty in a new Bayesian package (BESP) in BEAST2. We re-examine two well-studied empirical datasets from virus epidemiology and molecular evolution and find that the BESP improves upon previous coalescent estimators and generates new, biologically-useful insights into the sampling protocols underpinning these datasets. Sequence sampling times provide a rich source of information for coalescent inference that will become increasingly important as sequence collection intensifies and becomes more formalised.",

    "abstract": "Natural scenes often contain multiple objects and surfaces. However, how neurons in the visual cortex represent multiple visual stimuli is not well understood. Previous studies have shown that, when multiple stimuli compete in one feature domain, the evoked neuronal response is biased toward the stimulus that has a stronger signal strength. Here we investigate how neurons in the middle temporal (MT) cortex of macaques represent multiple stimuli that compete in more than one feature domain. Visual stimuli were two random-dot patches moving in different directions. One stimulus had low luminance contrast and moved with high coherence, whereas the other had high contrast and moved with low coherence. We found that how MT neurons represent multiple stimuli depended on the spatial arrangement of the stimuli. When two stimuli were overlapping, MT responses were dominated by the stimulus component that had high contrast. When two stimuli were spatially separated within the receptive fields, the contrast dominance was abolished. We found the same results when using contrast to compete with motion speed. Our neural data and computer simulations using a V1-MT model suggest that the contrast dominance found with overlapping stimuli is due to normalization occurring at an input stage fed to MT, and MT neurons cannot overturn this bias based on their own feature selectivity. The interaction between spatially separated stimuli can largely be explained by normalization within MT. Our results revealed new rules on stimulus competition and highlighted the impact of hierarchical processing on representing multiple stimuli in the visual cortex.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPrevious studies have shown that the neural representation of multiple visual stimuli can be accounted for by a divisive normalization model. By using multiple stimuli that compete in more than one feature domain, we found that luminance contrast has a dominant effect in determining competition between multiple stimuli when they were overlapping but not spatially separated. Our results revealed that neuronal responses to multiple stimuli in a given cortical area cannot be simply predicted by the population neural responses elicited in that area by the individual stimulus components. To understand the neural representation of multiple stimuli, rather than considering response normalization only within the area of interest, one must consider the computations including normalization occurring along the hierarchical visual pathway.",

    "abstract": "The importance of social hierarchies has led to the development of many techniques for inferring social ranks, leaving researchers with an overwhelming array of options to choose from. Many of our research questions involve longitudinal analyses, so we were interested in a method that would provide reliable ranks across time. But how does one determine which method performs best?\\n\\nWe attempt to answer this question by using a training-testing procedure to compare 13 different approaches for calculating dominance hierarchies (seven methods, plus 6 analytical variants of these). We assess each methods performance, its efficiency, and the extent to which the calculated ranks obtained from the training dataset accurately predict the outcome of observed aggression in the testing dataset.\\n\\nWe found that all methods tested performed well, despite some differences in inferred rank order. With respect to the need for a \\\"burn-in\\\" period to enable reliable ranks to be calculated, again, all methods were efficient and able to infer reliable ranks from the very start of the study period (i.e., with little to no burn-in period). Using a common 6-month burn-in period to aid comparison, we found that all methods could predict aggressive outcomes accurately for the subsequent 10 months. Beyond this 10-month threshold, accuracy in prediction decreased as the testing dataset increased in length. The decay was rather shallow, however, indicating overall rank stability during this period.\\n\\nIn general, a training-testing approach allows researchers to determine the most appropriate method for their dataset, given sampling effort, the frequency of agonistic interactions, the steepness of the hierarchy, and the nature of the research question being asked. Put simply, we did not find a single best method, but our approach offers researchers a valuable tool for identifying the method that will work best for them.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAll ranking methods tested performed well at predicting future aggressive outcomes, despite some differences in inferred rank order.\\nC_LIO_LIAll ranking methods appear to be efficient in inferring reliable ranks from the very start (i.e., with little to no burn-in period), but all showed improvement as the burn-in period increased.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing a common 6-month burn-in period, we found that all methods could predict aggressive outcomes accurately for the subsequent 10 months.

As they are not connected by vesicular transport, the exchange of lipids between ER and mitochondria occurs at sites of close organelle apposition called membrane contact sites. However, the mechanisms and proteins involved in these processes are only beginning to emerge. Here, we show that the main physiological localization of the lipid transfer proteins ORP5 and ORP8 is at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) subdomains, physically linked to the MIB/MICOS complexes that bridge the two mitochondrial membranes. We also show that ORP5/8 mediate non-vesicular transport of phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids from the ER to mitochondria by cooperating with the MIB/MICOS complexes. Overall our study reveals a novel physical and functional link between ER-mitochondria contacts involved in lipid transfer and intra-mitochondrial membranes contacts maintained by the MIB/MICOS complexes.",

Here we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure brain activity from instructor-learner dyads simultaneously during dynamic conceptual learning. We report that brain-to-brain coupling is correlated with learning outcomes, and, crucially, appears to be driven by specific scaffolding behaviors on the part of the instructors (e.g., asking guiding questions or providing hints). Brain-to-brain coupling enhancement is absent when instructors use an explanation approach (e.g., providing definitions or clarifications). Finally, we find that machine-learning techniques are more successful when decoding instructional approaches (scaffolding vs. explanation) from brain-to-brain coupling data than when using a single-brain method. These findings suggest that brain-to-brain coupling as a pedagogically relevant measure tracks the naturalistic instructional process during instructor-learner interaction throughout constructive engagement, but not information clarification.",

However, because HL-60 cells proliferate in an incompletely differentiated state, they must undergo differentiation before they acquire the functional properties of neutrophils. Here we provide evidence of swarming and chemotaxis in HL-60 neutrophil-like cells using precision microfluidic assays. We found that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) differentiated HL-60 cells have larger size, increased length, and lower ability to squeeze through narrow channels compared to primary neutrophils. They migrate through tapered microfluidic channels slower than primary neutrophils, but faster than HL60s differentiated by other protocols, e.g. using all-trans retinoic acid. We found that differentiated HL-60 can swarm toward zymosan particle clusters, though they display disorganized migratory patterns and produce swarms of smaller size compared to primary neutrophils.",

By re-evaluating each gene-term annotation, a consensus dataset is produced with high-scoring confident annotations and low-scoring rejected annotations. Applying CrowdGO to results from a deep learning-based, a sequence similarity-based, and two protein domain-based methods, delivers consensus annotations with improved precision and recall. Furthermore, using standard evaluation measures CrowdGO performance matches that of the communitys best performing individual methods.\n\nConclusionCrowdGO offers a model-informed approach to leverage strengths of individual predictors and produce comprehensive and accurate gene functional annotations.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationCrowdGO is implemented in Python3, and is freely available from https://gitlab.com/mreijnders/CrowdGO, with a Snakemake workflow and pre-trained models.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional repression needs to be rapidly reversible during embryonic development. This extends to the Hedgehog pathway, which primarily serves to counter GLI repression by processing GLI proteins into transcriptional activators. In investigating the mechanisms underlying GLI repression, we find that a subset of these regions, termed HH-responsive enhancers, specifically loses acetylation in the absence of HH signaling. These regions are highly enriched around HH target genes and primarily drive HH-specific limb activity. They also retain H3K27ac enrichment in limb buds devoid of GLI activator and repressor, indicating that their activity is primarily regulated by GLI repression. The Polycomb repression complex is not active at most of these regions, suggesting it is not a major mechanism of GLI repression. We propose a model for tissue-specific enhancer activity in which an HDAC-associated GLI repression complex regulates target gene expression by altering the acetylation status at enhancers.",

    "abstract": "Plants have a highly sophisticated endomembrane system targeted by plant viruses for cell-to-cell movement. The movement protein (MP) of ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is delivered to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Although several functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP have been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach the PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Glycine substitutions in these motifs result in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at the PD. Taken together, these results suggest that both motifs are indispensable for targeting OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection but show differences in functionality. Co-immunoprecipitation assays coupled with mass spectrometry identified a series of host factors that could interact with the OuMV MP and link the MP with various pathways, in particular vesicle trafficking and membrane lipids. This study provides new insights into the intracellular targeting of MPs and pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.",

We compared Improvising musicians, Classical musicians, and Minimally Musically Trained (MMT) controls in seed-based functional connectivity and network analyses in resting state functional MRI. We also examined the functional correlates of behavioral performance in musical improvisation and divergent thinking. Seed-based analysis consistently showed higher connectivity in ventral DMN (vDMN) and bilateral ECN in both groups of musically trained individuals as compared to MMT controls, with additional group differences in primary visual network, precuneus network, and posterior salience network. In particular, primary visual network connectivity to DMN and ECN was highest in Improvisational musicians, whereas within-network connectivity of vDMN and precuneus network was higher in both Improvisational and Classical musicians than in MMT controls; in contrast, connectivity between posterior salience network and superior parietal lobule was highest in Classical musicians. Furthermore, graph-theoretical analysis indicated heightened betweenness centrality, clustering, and local efficiency in Classical musicians.

Their growth coincides with a local increase in anammox power supply. The genome of the dominant anammox bacterium from the NATZ was reconstructed and showed an increased index of replication confirming in situ active growth. The genome belongs to a new Scalindua species so far exclusively found in marine environments, which has the genetic capacity of urea and cyanate utilization and is enriched in genes allowing it to cope with external environmental stressors, such as energy limitation. Our results suggest that specific microbial groups are not only able to survive over geological timescales, but also thrive in the deep subsurface when encountering favorable conditions.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian cerebral cortex is recapitulated during embryonic development in large mammals, but the underlying genetic mechanisms remain mostly unknown. Previous transcriptomic analyses of the developing ferret cortex identify candidate genes related to the expansion of germinal layers and cortex size. Here we focused on MIR3607, a microRNA differentially expressed between germinal layers of the large human and ferret cortex, not expressed in the small mouse cortex. Expression of MIR3607 in mouse embryos at E14.5 leads to increased progenitor cell proliferation. This is reflected in transcriptomic changes, which also reveal increased Wnt/{beta}Catenin signaling. Expression of MIR3607 at E12.5, when progenitor cells expand, causes amplification and severe delamination of apical progenitors, leading to rosette formation. This is rescued by co-expressing Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. A similar phenotype is produced in human cerebral organoids. Our findings demonstrate that MIR3607 expands and delaminates apical progenitor cells via activating Wnt/{beta}Catenin, and suggest that a secondary loss of expression in mouse may underlie their reduction in cortex size during recent evolution.",

    "abstract": "Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are Ca2+-regulated Ca2+ channels of 2.2-megadalton in muscles and neurons for calcium signaling. How Ca2+ regulates ion conduction in the RyR channels remains elusive. We determined a 2.6-[A] cryo-EM structure of rabbit skeletal muscle RyR1, and used multiscale dynamics simulations to elucidate cation interactions with RyR1. We investigated 21 potential cation-binding sites that may together rationalize biphasic Ca2+ response of RyR1. The selectivity filter captures a cation hydration complex by hydrogen-bonding with both the inner and outer hydration shells of water molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that adjacent Ca2+ ions moving in concert along ion-permeation pathway are separated by at least two cation-binding sites. Our analysis reveals that RyR1 has been evolved to favor its interactions with two hydration shells of cations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease is a major health problem, affecting ~4*5% of people aged 60 and older in 2016 with over 43 million affected globally1. The traditional approach for detection evaluates an individual in the presence of symptoms. However, it has been established that amyloid deposits begin to accumulate years before symptoms begin to appear2,3. With improved technology, there is increased focus on risk reduction, timely diagnosis, and early intervention. Early identification of at-risk individuals may enable patients and their families to better prepare for and reduce the impact of this condition.\\n\\nMethodsWe obtained data for patients from two longitudinal retrospective cohorts (Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: ADNI and National Alzheimers Coordinating Center: NACC), including T1-weighted MRI and genetics data. The polygenic risk score (PRS) used in this study was built based on a published Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) that identified variants associated with Alzheimers disease. Quantitative MRI features were obtained using a 3D U-Net neural network for brain segmentation. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) regression models were used with subjects censored at death or the last evaluation. Time-to-event was defined as the time it takes for an individual who is dementia-free at the baseline MRI to progress to dementia as defined by the criteria described by ADNI. Time-dependent ROC areas under curve (AUCs) were estimated in the presence of censored data. The time-dependent AUCs were compared among models using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for dependent samples. Data was binned into three groups according to survival probability to eight years after baseline and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the probability of surviving at least to time t. Calibration for both training and validation cohorts was evaluated using the predicted survival probability, splitting samples into five risk groups of equal size based on the predicted survival probability.\\n\\nFindingsWe developed a model that predicts the onset of dementia over an eight-year time window in individuals with genetics data and a T1-weighted MRI who were dementia-free at baseline. We then validated the model in an independent multisite cohort.\\n\\nWe observed that models using PRS in addition to MRI-derived features performed significantly better as measured by time-varying AUC up to eight years in both the training (p = 0*0071) and validation (p = 0*050) cohorts. We observed improved performance of the two modalities versus MRI alone when compared with more invasive amyloid measures. The combined MRI and PRS model showed equivalent performance to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid measurement up to eight years prior to disease onset (p = 0*181) and while the MRI only model performed worse (p = 0*040). Finally, we compared to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) three to four years prior to disease onset with favorable results.\\n\\nInterpretationOur finding suggests that the two modalities are complementary measures, in that MRI reflects near-term decline and the addition of genetics extends the prediction scope of quantitative MRI by adding additional long-term predictive power.\\n\\nThe proposed multimodal model shows potential as an alternate solution for early risk assessment given the concordance with CSF amyloid and amyloid PET. Future work will include further comparison with amyloid PET (greater than four years) and with CSF (greater than eight years) as additional long-term data becomes available. Also, the model will be evaluated for its clinical utility in the \\\"active surveillance\\\" of individuals who may be concerned about their risk of developing dementia but are not yet eligible for assessment by amyloid PET or CSF.\\n\\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT\\n\\nEvidence before this studyThe most significant known genetic factor in Alzheimers disease (AD) is the {varepsilon}4 allele for the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Carriers of the allele have a three-fold increased risk of developing AD, whereas individuals who are homozygous have a 15-fold increased risk. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many additional genetic variants that are associated with AD. Recent studies have shown that the risk for AD is better predicted by combining effects from several genetic variants into \\\"polygenic risk scores\\\" (PRS). Studies have also demonstrated that the age of onset for AD is better predicted using PRS rather than APOE status alone. Regional brain atrophy, as measured using volumetric MRI, is also an important biomarker for evaluating an individuals risk of developing dementia. Previous predictions have shown that medial temporal lobe atrophy, as measured by a Hippocampal Occupancy Score (HOC) is highly associated with progression from MCI to AD.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyIn the proposed model, the addition of genetics to MRI data lengthens the time over which the model can predict onset of dementia. The two measures appear to be complementary, with MRI showing near-term decline and genetics providing additional predictive power in the long-term. When compared to more invasive measures of amyloid, which have been shown to have long-term predictive power, we observed equivalent performance to CSF amyloid up to 8 years prior to disease onset and equivalent performance to amyloid PET three to four years prior to disease onset.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceAlthough MRI remains relatively expensive, it is less expensive, less invasive, more accessible, and more commonly available than amyloid PET. Furthermore, MRI is already part of standard clinical practice and this model may be applied to standard clinical MRIs with no additional acquisition required. A recent survey of patients and their caregivers has highlighted a desire for access to better diagnostics, such as amyloid PET, to aid them in long-term legal, financial and healthcare planning. Our model, given the concordance with CSF and amyloid PET could be an alternate solution to fulfill this need. Furthermore, our model could facilitate the \\\"active surveillance\\\" of individuals who are high-risk and thereby enhance the possibility of early intervention.",
