    "abstract": "Dissecting the cellular heterogeneity embedded in single-cell transcriptomic data is challenging. Although a large number of methods and approaches exist, robustly identifying underlying cell states and their associations is still a major challenge; given the nonexclusive and dynamic influence of multiple unknown sources of variability, the existence of state continuum at the time-scale of observation, and the inevitable snapshot nature of experiments. As a way to address some of these challenges, here we introduce ACTIONet, a comprehensive framework that combines archetypal analysis and network theory to provide a ready-to-use analytical approach for multiresolution single-cell state characterization. ACTIONet uses multilevel matrix decomposition and network reconstruction to simultaneously learn cell state patterns, quantify single-cell states, and reconstruct a reproducible structural representation of the transcriptional state space that is geometrically mapped to a color space. A color-enhanced quantitative view of cell states enables novel visualization, prediction, and annotation approaches. Using data from multiple tissues, organisms, and developmental conditions, we illustrate how ACTIONet facilitates the reconstruction and exploration of single-cell state landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Coupling among neural rhythms is one of the most important mechanisms at the basis of cognitive processes in the brain. In this study we consider a neural mass model, rigorously obtained from the microscopic dynamics of an inhibitory spiking network with exponential synapses, able to autonomously generate collective oscillations (COs). These oscillations emerge via a super-critical Hopf bifurcation, and their frequencies are controlled by the synaptic time scale, the synaptic coupling and the excitability of the neural population. Furthermore, we show that two inhibitory populations in a master-slave configuration with different synaptic time scales can display various collective dynamical regimes: namely, damped oscillations towards a stable focus, periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations, and chaos. Finally, when bidirectionally coupled the two inhibitory populations can exhibit different types of{theta} -{gamma} cross-frequency couplings (CFCs): namely, phase-phase and phase-amplitude CFC. The coupling between{theta} and{gamma} COs is enhanced in presence of a external{theta} forcing, reminiscent of the type of modulation induced in Hippocampal and Cortex circuits via optogenetic drive.\\n\\nIn healthy conditions, the brains activity reveals a series of intermingled oscillations, generated by large ensembles of neurons, which provide a functional substrate for information processing. How single neuron properties influence neuronal population dynamics is an unsolved question, whose solution could help in the understanding of the emergent collective behaviors arising during cognitive processes. Here we consider a neural mass model, which reproduces exactly the macroscopic activity of a network of spiking neurons. This mean-field model is employed to shade some light on an important and ubiquitous neural mechanism underlying information processing in the brain: the{theta} -{gamma} cross-frequency coupling. In particular, we will explore in detail the conditions under which two coupled inhibitory neural populations can generate these functionally relevant coupled rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Phospholipase D3 (PLD3) is a protein of unclear function that structurally resembles other members of the phospholipase D superfamily. A coding variant in this gene confers increased risk for the development of Alzheimers disease (AD), although the magnitude of this effect has been controversial. Because of the potential significance of this obscure protein, we undertook a study to determine whether PLD3 is relevant to memory and cognition in sporadic AD, to observe its distribution in normal human brain and AD-affected brain, to describe its subcellular localization, and to evaluate its molecular function. PLD3 mRNA levels in the human pre-frontal cortex inversely correlated with {beta}-amyloid pathology severity and rate of cognitive decline in 531 participants enrolled in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. PLD3 levels across genetically diverse BXD mouse strains and strains crossed with 5xFAD mice correlated strongly with learning and memory performance in a fear conditioning task. In human neuropathological samples, PLD3 was primarily found within neurons and colocalized with lysosome markers (LAMP2, progranulin, and cathepsins D and B). This colocalization was also present in AD brain with prominent enrichment on lysosomal accumulations within dystrophic neurites surrounding {beta}-amyloid plaques. This pattern of protein distribution was conserved in mouse brain in wild type and the 5xFAD mouse model of cerebral {beta}-amyloidosis. We discovered PLD3 has phospholipase D activity in lysosomes. A coding variant in PLD3 reported to confer AD risk significantly reduced enzymatic activity compared to wild-type PLD3. In summary, this study identified a new functional mammalian phospholipase D isoform which is lysosomal and closely associated with both {beta}-amyloid pathology and cognition.",

    "abstract": "From typing on a keyboard to playing the piano, many everyday skills require the ability to quickly and accurately perform sequential movements. It is well-known that the availability of rewards leads to increases in motivational vigor whereby people enhance both the speed and force of their movements. However, in the context of motor skills, it is unclear whether rewards also lead to more effective motor planning and action selection. Here, we trained human participants to perform four separate sequences in a skilled motor sequencing task. Two of these sequences were trained explicitly and performed with pre-cues that allow for the planning of movements, while the other two were trained implicitly. Immediately following the introduction of performance-contingent monetary incentives, participants improved their performance on all sequences consistent with enhancements in motivational vigor. However, there was a much larger performance boost for explicitly trained sequences. We replicated these results in a second, pre-registered experiment with an independent sample. We conclude from these experiments that rewards enhance both the planning of movements as well as motivational vigor.",

It is unclear what the critical conditions for learning are. Here, we ask how reward-based sensorimotor learning depends on the number of factors that are task-relevant. In a task that involves two factors, we test whether learning improves by giving feedback on each factor in a separate phase of the learning. Participants learned to perform a 3D trajectory matching task on the basis of binary reward-feedback in three phases. In the first and second phase, the reward could be based on the produced slant, the produced length or the combination of the two. In the third phase, the feedback was always based on the combination of the two factors. The results showed that reward-based learning did not depend on the number of factors that were task-relevant. Consistently, providing feedback on a single factor in the first two phases did not improve motor learning in the third phase.",

Introns are known to both increase expression levels and provide means for making different protein products from the same gene via alternative splicing. It is thought that evolution has selected for these functions of introns. Here we present evidence for an additional reason why so many metazoan genes have introns, and why some do not. We found that introns control stochasticity in metazoan gene expression. They do this by controlling stochastic autosomal allele bias. We determined this by measuring the expression of differently colored reporter alleles with and without introns. We find that introns control stochastic autosomal allele biases using a 5-position dependent mechanism. Intron control of allele expression noise provides an additional mechanism to consider when pondering why so many metazoan genes have introns and why some have lost them.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRibosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription by the RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is a rate-limited step for ribosome synthesis, which is critical for cell growth, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Meanwhile rDNA transcription is modulated by DNA methylation and histone epigenetic modification. Though with great progress in epigenetic research recently, it still remains much uncertain about the relationship of histone variant epigenetic modification and rDNA transcription.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, epigenetic profiles of silent rDNA in next-generation sequencing datasets were examined. We found that the chaperone of histone variant H3.3, the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked syndrome protein (ATRX)/death domain-associated protein (DAXX) complex, and methyltransferase SET domain bifurcated 1 (Setdb1, also known as ESET) help maintain H3.3K9me3 modifications among the promoter and coding regions of silent rDNA. Our experiments further confirmed that DAXX depletion leads to the conversion of silent rDNA into upstream binding factor-bound active rDNA and the release of rDNA transcriptional potency. Support for this model is provided by data from a low-grade glioma in which ATRX is lost and a higher level of ribosomal biosynthesis, nucleolus activity, and proliferation are observed.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate a model of epigenetic regulation for rDNA with roles for the ATRX/DAXX complex and H3.3/H3K9me3 modifications identified. Thus, loss of ATRX/DAXX may represent a driving force for tumorigenesis due to its contribution to the release of rDNA transcriptional potency.",

    "abstract": "NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are key players in the initiation of synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses require an increased calcium current via NMDA channels to trigger modifications in postsynaptic density (PSD). It is generally believed that the amount of NMDARs on the postsynaptic surface remains stationary, whereas their subunit composition is dynamically fluctuated during this plasticity process. However, the molecular machinery underlying this subunit-specific regulation remains largely elusive. Here, by detecting the time-lapse changes of surface GluN2A and GluN2B subunit levels using biochemical approaches, surface immunostaining, live-imaging and super-resolution microscopy, we uncovered a transient increase of surface GluN2A-type NMDARs shortly after the induction of chemical long term potentiation (cLTP). These augmented sub-diffraction-limited GluN2A clusters predominantly exist in extrasynaptic domains. We also showed that the spine-enriched SNARE associated protein SNAP-23, and to a minor extent its homologue SNAP-25, control both the basal and regulated surface level of GluN2A receptors. Using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) based live-imaging assay, we resolved and analyzed individual exocytic events of NMDARs in live neurons and found that cLTP raised the frequency of NMDAR exocytosis at extrasynaptic regions, without altering the duration or the package size of these events. Our study thereby provides direct evidence that synaptic plasticity controls the postsynaptic exocytosis machinery, which induces the insertion of more GluN2A receptors into the extrasynaptic area.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMemory formation involves the long-term modification of synapses, which is called synaptic plasticity. In the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excited neurons, this modification process occurs on a minute timescale, initiated by the opening of NMDARs that trigger downstream cascades to fix the potentiation (LTP) at specific synapses for longer timescales. Here, using a novel live-imaging assay we resolved the dynamic delivery of NMDARs to the cell surface, and found that only the insertion frequency, not the duration of individual insertion or number of GluN2A subunits each of these NMDAR vesicles contains, was altered during the synaptic potentiation process. We also identified SNAP-23 as the key molecule mediating this activity dependent NMDAR surface delivery. This study provides a novel mechanism of how NMDARs are regulated in the short window to initiate the long-lasting synaptic modifications.",

Precisely timed neural oscillations interacting within and between these brain structures are thought to mediate this sleep-dependent memory consolidation, but exactly which sleep oscillations instantiate the HPC-NC dialog, and via what mechanisms, remains elusive. Employing invasive electroencephalography in ten neurosurgical patients across a full night of sleep, we identified three broad classes of phase-based HPC-NC communication. First, we observed interregional phase synchrony for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) spindles, N2 and rapid eye movement (REM) theta, and N3 beta activity. Second, and most intriguingly, we found asymmetrical N3 cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling between HPC SOs and NC activity spanning the delta to high-gamma/ripple bands, but not in the opposite direction. Lastly, N2 theta and NREM spindle synchrony were themselves modulated by HPC SOs. These novel forms of phase-based interregional communication emphasize the role of HPC SOs in the HPC-NC dialog, and may offer a physiological basis for the sleep-dependent reorganization of mnemonic content.",

    "abstract": "Natural populations are exposed to seasonal variation in environmental factors that simultaneously affect several demographic rates (survival, development, reproduction). The resulting covariation in these rates determines population dynamics, but accounting for its numerous biotic and abiotic drivers is a significant challenge. Here, we use a factor-analytic approach to capture partially unobserved drivers of seasonal population dynamics. We use 40 years of individual-based demography from yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) to fit and project population models that account for seasonal demographic covariation using a latent variable. We show that this latent variable, by producing positive covariation among winter demographic rates, depicts a measure of environmental quality. Simultaneous, negative responses of winter survival and reproductive-status change to declining environmental quality result in a higher risk of population quasi-extinction, regardless of summer demography where recruitment takes place. We demonstrate how complex environmental processes can be summarized to understand population persistence in seasonal environments.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen-mediated damage to the intestinal epithelium activates compensatory growth and differentiation repair programs in progenitor cells. Accelerated progenitor growth replenishes damaged tissue and maintains barrier integrity. Despite the importance of epithelial renewal to intestinal homeostasis, we know little about the effects of pathogen-commensal interactions on progenitor growth. We found that the enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae, blocks critical growth and differentiation pathways in Drosophila progenitors despite extensive damage to the epithelial tissue. We showed that inhibition of epithelial repair requires interactions of the Vibrio cholerae type six secretion system with a complex community of symbiotic bacteria, and that elimination of the gut microbiome is sufficient to restore homeostatic growth in infected intestines. Together, this work highlights the importance of pathogen-symbiont interactions on intestinal immune responses and outlines a previously undescribed impact of the type six secretion system on pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Organisms living in temperate regions are sensitive to seasonal variations in the environment; they are known to accumulate energy as fat in their livers during the winter when days are shorter, temperatures are lower, and food is scarce. However, the impact of variations in photoperiod alone on hepatic lipid metabolism has not been well-studied. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed lipid metabolism in the liver of medaka, Oryzias latipes, while varying the length of days at constant temperature. Larger amounts of fatty acids accumulated in the liver after 14 days under short-day conditions than under long-day conditions. Metabolome analysis showed no accumulation of the long-chain unsaturated fatty acids required at low temperatures, but showed a significant accumulation of long-chain saturated fatty acids. Short-day conditions induced decreased levels of succinate, fumarate, and malate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, decreased expression of PPAR, and decreased accumulation of acylcarnitine, which suggested inhibition of lipolysis. In addition, when a high-fat diet was administered to transparent medaka under short-day conditions, larger amounts of fat accumulated and medaka with fatty liver were efficiently produced. Detailed analysis of the relationship between seasonal changes and hepatic steatosis will be important in the future as hepatic diseases become more prevalent in modern society; the findings obtained in our study will be useful for research studies pertaining to the relationship between photoperiod and disorders such as hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.",

    "abstract": "Standardised Type IIS DNA assembly methods are becoming essential for biological engineering and research. Although a  common syntax has been proposed to enable higher interoperability between DNA libraries, Golden Gate (GG)-based assembly systems remain specific to target organisms. Furthermore, these GG assembly systems become laborious and unnecessarily complicated beyond the assembly of 4 transcriptional units. Here, we describe \\\"universal Loop\\\" (uLoop) assembly, a simple system based on Loop assembly that enables hierarchical fabrication of large DNA constructs (> 30 kb) for any organism of choice. uLoop comprises two sets of four plasmids that are iteratively used as odd and even levels to compile DNA elements in an exponential manner (4n-1). The elements required for transformation/maintenance in target organisms are also assembled as standardised parts, enabling customisation of host-specific plasmids. Thus, this species-agnostic method decouples efficiency of assembly from the stability of vectors in the target organism. As a proof-of-concept, we show the engineering of multi-gene expression vectors in diatoms, yeast, plants and bacteria.

    "abstract": "We present the Chemical Checker (CC), a resource that provides processed, harmonized and integrated bioactivity data on 800,000 small molecules. The CC divides data into five levels of increasing complexity, ranging from the chemical properties of compounds to their clinical outcomes. In between, it considers targets, off-targets, perturbed biological networks and several cell-based assays such as gene expression, growth inhibition and morphological profilings. In the CC, bioactivity data are expressed in a vector format, which naturally extends the notion of chemical similarity between compounds to similarities between bioactivity signatures of different kinds. We show how CC signatures can boost the performance of drug discovery tasks that typically capitalize on chemical descriptors, including target identification and library characterization. Moreover, we demonstrate and experimentally validate that CC signatures can be used to reverse and mimic biological signatures of disease models and genetic perturbations, options that are otherwise impossible using chemical information alone.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinins are effective against a variety of parasites and provide the first line of treatment for malaria. Laboratory studies have identified several mechanisms for artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, including mutations in Kelch13 that are associated with delayed clearance in some clinical isolates, although other mechanisms are likely involved. To explore other potential mechanisms of resistance in parasites, we took advantage of the genetic tractability of T. gondii, a related apicomplexan parasite that shows moderate sensitivity to artemisinin. Resistant populations of T. gondii were selected by culture in increasing drug concentrations and whole genome sequencing identified several non-conservative point mutations that emerged in the population and were fixed over time. Genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 was used to introduce point mutations conferring amino acids changes in a serine protease homologous to DegP and a serine/threonine protein kinase of unknown function. Single and double mutations conferred a competitive advantage over wild type parasites in the presence of drug, despite not changing EC50 values. Additionally, the evolved resistant lines showed dramatic amplification of the mitochondrial genome, including genes encoding cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase I. Consistent with prior studies in yeast and mammalian tumor cells that implicate the mitochondrion as a target of artemisinins, treatment of wild type parasites with artemisinin decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and resistant parasites showed altered morphology and decreased membrane potential. These findings extend the repertoire of mutations associated with artemisinin resistance and suggest that the mitochondrion may be an important target of inhibition in T. gondii.\\n\\nSignificanceArtemisinins provide important therapeutic agents for treatment of malaria and have potential for use in other infections and in cancer. Their use is threatened by the potential for resistance development, so understanding their mechanism of action and identifying genetic changes that alter sensitivity are important for improving clinical outcomes. Our findings suggest that mutations in novel targets can contribute to the emergence of parasites with increased tolerance to artemisinin treatment and that such mutations can confer a fitness advantage even in the absence of a notable shift in EC50. Our findings also support the idea that inhibition of mitochondrial function may be an important target in T. gondii, as previously suggested by studies in yeast and human cancer cells.",

The design also presents an improvement over many existing designs in terms of robustness and ease of use. We describe two variants: a 16 tetrode implant weighing [~]2 g for mice, bats, tree shrews and similar animals, and a 64 tetrode implant weighing [~]16 g for rats, and similar animals.These designs were co-developed and optimized alongside a new class of drive-mounted feature-rich amplifier boards with ultra-thin RF tethers, as described in an upcoming paper (Newman, Zhang et al., in prep).

    "abstract": "Implantable neural microelectrodes are integral components of neuroprosthetic technologies and can transform treatments for many neural-mediated disorders. However, dielectric material degradation during long-term (> 1 year) indwelling periods restricts device functional lifetimes to a few years. This comprehensive work carefully investigates in vivo material degradation and also explores the ability of in vitro Reactive Accelerated Aging (RAA) to evaluate implant stability. Parylene C-coated Utah electrode arrays (UEAs) implanted in feline peripheral nerve for 3.25 years were explanted and compared to RAA-processed devices, aged in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) + 20 mM H2O2 at either 67 or 87 {degrees}C (28 or 7 days, respectively). Electron microscopy revealed similar physical damage characteristics between explants and RAA (87{degrees} C) devices. Parylene C degradation was overwhelmingly apparent for UEAs from both RAA cohorts. Controls aged in PBS alone displayed almost no damage. Spectroscopic characterization (EDX, XPS, FTIR) found clear indications of oxidation and chlorine abstraction for parylene C aged in vivo. While in vitro aging was also accompanied by signs of oxidation, changes in the chemistry in vivo and in vitro were statistically different. Analysis of RAA- aged devices identified UEA fabrication approaches that may greatly improve device resistance to degradation. This work underscores the need for an improved understanding of in vivo damage mechanisms, to facilitate the critical need for representative in vitro accelerated testing paradigms for long-term implants.",

    "abstract": "BK Polyomavirus (BKPyV), belongs to the same family as SV40 and JC Virus and has recently been associated with both Sjogrens Syndrome and HIV associated Salivary Gland Disease. BKPyV was previously only known for causing the rejection of kidney transplants. As such, BKPyV infection of salivary gland cells implicates oral transmission of the virus. BKPyV replicates slowly in salivary gland cells, producing infectious virus after 72-96 hours. However, it remains unclear how this virus infects or replicates within salivary gland cells, blocking the development of therapeutic strategies to inhibit the virus. Thus, an intracellular, computational model using agent-based modeling was developed to model BKPyV replication within a salivary gland cell. In addition to viral proteins, we modeled host cell machinery that aids transcription, translation and replication of BKPyV. The model has separate cytosolic and nuclear compartments, and represents all large molecules such as proteins, RNAs, and DNA as individual computer \\\"agents\\\" that move and interact within the simulated salivary gland cell environment. An application of the Boids algorithm was implemented to simulate molecular binding and formation of BKPyV virions and BKPyV virus-like particles (VLPs). This approach enables the direct study of spatially complex processes such as BKPyV virus self-assembly, transcription, and translation. This model reinforces experimental results implicating the processes that result in the slow accumulation of viral proteins. It revealed that the slow BKPyV replication rate in salivary gland cells might be explained by capsid subunit accumulation rates. BKPyV particles may only form after large concentrations of capsid subunits have accumulated. In addition, salivary gland specific transcription factors may enable early region transcription of BKPyV.",

    "abstract": "Liposomes are an important tool and have gained much attention for their promise as an effective means of delivering small therapeutic compounds to targeted sites. In an effort to establish an effective method to produce liposomes from the lipid, dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine or DPPC, we have found important aspects that must be taken into consideration. Here, we used probe-tip sonication to prepare liposomes on a batch scale. During this process we uncovered interesting steps in their preparation that altered the thermodynamic properties and phase transitions of the resulting liposome mixtures. Using differential scanning calorimetry to assess this we found that increasing the sonication time had the most dramatic effect on our sample, producing almost an entirely separate phase transition relative to the main phase transition. This result is consistent with reports from the current literature. We also highlight a smaller transition, which we attribute to traces of unincorporated lipid that seems to gradually disappear as the total lipid concentration decreases. Overall, sonication is an effective means of producing liposomes, but we cannot assert this method is optimal in producing them with precise physical properties. Here we highlight the physical effects at play during this process.",

Tissue macrophages (M{phi}s), dependent on signals from the M{phi} colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), have been shown to regulate the generation, regression and regeneration of this organ, which is central for mammalian offspring survival. However, the distribution of M{phi}s in the pre- and post-natal mammary gland, as it undergoes distinct phases of development and regression, is unknown or has been inferred from immunostaining of thin tissue sections. Here, we used optical tissue clearing and 3-dimensional imaging of mammary tissue obtained from Csf1r-EGFP mice. Whilst tissue M{phi}s were observed at all developmental phases, their abundance, morphology, localization and association with luminal and basal epithelial cells exhibited stage-specific differences. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism was observed at E14.5, when the male mammary bud is severed from the overlying epidermis. These findings provide new insights into the localization and possible functions of heterogeneous tissue M{phi} populations in mammogenesis.",
