    "abstract": "Efficient precision genome editing requires a quick, quantitative, and inexpensive assay of editing outcomes. Here we present ICE (Inference of CRISPR Edits), which enables robust analysis of CRISPR edits using Sanger data. ICE proposes potential outcomes for editing with guide RNAs (gRNAs) and then determines which are supported by the data via regression. Additionally, we develop a score called ICE-D (Discordance) that can provide information on large or unexpected edits. We empirically confirm through over 1,800 edits that the ICE algorithm is robust, reproducible, and can analyze CRISPR experiments within days after transfection. We also confirm that ICE strongly correlates with next-generation sequencing of amplicons (Amp-Seq). The ICE tool is free to use and offers several improvements over current analysis tools. For instance, ICE can analyze individual experiments as well as multiple experiments simultaneously (batch analysis). ICE can also detect a wider variety of outcomes, including multi-guide edits (multiple gRNAs per target) and edits resulting from homology-directed repair (HDR), such as knock-ins and base edits. ICE is a reliable analysis tool that can significantly expedite CRISPR editing workflows. It is available online at ice.synthego.com, and the source code is at github.com/synthego-open/ice",

    "abstract": "In genomics, transcriptomics, and related biological fields (collectively known as omics), it is common to work with n << p datasets with the dimensionality much larger than the sample size. In recent years, combinations of experimental techniques began to yield multiple sets of features for the same set of biological replicates. One example is Patch-seq, a method combining single-cell RNA sequencing with electrophysiological recordings from the same cells. Here we present a framework based on sparse reduced-rank regression for obtaining an interpretable visualization of the relationship between the transcriptomic and the electrophysiological data. We use an elastic net regularization penalty that yields sparse solutions and allows for an efficient computational implementation. Using several publicly available Patch-seq datasets, we show that sparse reduced-rank regression outperforms both sparse full-rank regression and non-sparse reduced-rank regression in terms of predictive performance, and can outperform existing methods for sparse partial least squares and sparse canonical correlation analysis in terms of out-of-sample correlations. We introduce a bibiplot visualization in order to display the dominant factors determining the relationship between transcriptomic and electrophysiological properties of neurons. We believe that sparse reduced-rank regression can provide a valuable tool for the exploration and visualization of paired multivariate datasets, including Patch-seq.",

    "abstract": "MotivationInferring properties of biological sequences--such as determining the species-of-origin of a DNA sequence or the function of an amino-acid sequence--is a core task in many bioinformatics applications. These tasks are often solved using string-matching to map query sequences to labeled database sequences or via Hidden Markov Model-like pattern matching. In the current work we describe and assess an deep learning approach which trains a deep neural network (DNN) to predict database-derived labels directly from query sequences.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate this DNN performs at state-of-the-art or above levels on a difficult, practically important problem: predicting species-of-origin from short reads of 16S ribosomal DNA. When trained on 16S sequences of over 13,000 distinct species, our DNN achieves read-level species classification accuracy within 2.0% of perfect memorization of training data, and produces more accurate genus-level assignments for reads from held-out species than k-mer, alignment, and taxonomic binning baselines. Moreover, our models exhibit greater robustness than these existing approaches to increasing noise in the query sequences. Finally, we show that these DNNs perform well on experimental 16S mock community dataset. Overall, our results constitute a first step towards our long-term goal of developing a general-purpose deep learning approach to predicting meaningful labels from short biological sequences.\n\nAvailabilityTensorFlow training code is available through GitHub (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research).

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscription in mammalian cells is a complex stochastic process involving shuttling of polymerase between genes and phase-separated liquid condensates. It occurs in bursts, which results in vastly different numbers of an mRNA species in isogenic cell populations. Several factors contributing to transcriptional bursting have been identified, usually classified as intrinsic, in other words local to single genes, or extrinsic, relating to the macroscopic state of the cell. However, some possible contributors have not been explored yet. Here, we focus on processes at the 3 and 5 ends of a gene that enable reinitiation of transcription upon termination.\n\nResultsUsing Bayesian methodology, we measure the transcriptional bursting in inducible transgenes, showing that perturbation of polymerase shuttling typically reduces burst size, increases burst frequency, and thus limits transcriptional noise. Analysis based on paired-end tag sequencing (PolII ChIA-PET) suggests that this effect is genome wide. The observed noise patterns are also reproduced by a generative model that captures major characteristics of the polymerase flux between the ends of a gene and a phase-separated compartment.\n\nConclusionsInteractions between the 3 and 5 ends of a gene, which facilitate polymerase recycling, are major contributors to transcriptional noise.",

    "abstract": "Short-term synaptic plasticity is widely found in many areas of the central nervous system. In particular, it is believed that synaptic depression can act as a mechanism to allow simple networks to generate a range of different firing patterns. The locomotor circuit of hatchling Xenopus tadpoles produces two types of behaviours: swimming and the slower, stronger struggling movement that is associated with rhythmic bends of the whole body. Struggling is accompanied by anti-phase bursts in neurons on each side of the spinal cord and is believed to be governed by a short-term synaptic depression of commissural inhibition. To better understand burst generation in struggling, we study a minimal network of two neurons coupled through depressing inhibitory synapses. Depending on the strength of the synaptic conductance between the two neurons, such a network can produce symmetric n - n anti-phase bursts, where neurons fire n spikes in alternation, with the period of such solutions increasing with the strength of the synaptic conductance. Relying on the timescale disparity in the model, we reduce the eight-dimensional network equations to a fully explicit scalar Poincare burst map. This map tracks the state of synaptic depression from one burst to the next, and captures the complex bursting dynamics of the network. Fixed points of this map are associated with stable burst solutions of the full network model, and are created through fold bifurcations of maps. We derive conditions that describe period increment bifurcations between stable n - n and (n + 1) - (n + 1) bursts, producing a full bifurcation diagram of the burst cycle period. Predictions of the Poincare map fit excellently with numerical simulations of the full network model, and allow the study of parameter sensitivity for rhythm generation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundObservational studies suggest that lower educational attainment may be associated with risky alcohol consumption behaviors. However, these findings may be biased by confounding and reverse causality. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), we can determine whether education is causally related to alcohol consumption behaviors and alcohol dependence (AD).\n\nMethodsWe performed two-sample MR using summary statistics from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 784,726 study participants to assess the causal effects of educational attainment on alcohol consumption behaviors, including intake frequency, total weekly drinks, beverage preferences, whether alcohol is consumed with meals, as well as AD risk. Of 53 independent (linkage disequilibrium R2=0.001, kb distance<10,000) nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that predict educational attainment, and after removal of palindromes with intermediate allele frequency, 51 were present in the alcohol consumption behaviors, and 44 were present in the AD GWAS. Complementary MR techniques accommodating different assumptions about genetic pleiotropy (inverse variance weighted (IVW), Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode MR) tested the sensitivity of our results.\n\nResultsWe found strong evidence of a causal effect between years of education and alcohol consumption behaviors generally. Higher educational attainment decreased alcohol intake frequency (IVW odds ratio (ORIVW), 0.718, 95% CI, 0.673-0.765, PIVW=4.62E-24), as well as weekly distilled spirits intake (ORIVW, 0.874, 95% CI, 0.833-0.917, PIVW=3.91E-08), and weekly beer plus cider intake (ORIVW, 0.837, 95% CI, 0.805-0.869, P=5.58E-20), but increased weekly white wine (ORIVW, 1.220, 95% CI, 1.172-1.269, PIVW=7.96E-23), red wine (ORIVW, 1.227, 95% CI, 1.174-1.282, PIVW=6.67E-20), and fortified wine intake (ORIVW, 1.051, 95% CI, 1.027-1.075, PIVW] =1.87E-07). We also found evidence educational attainment reduced AD risk (ORIVW.508, 95% CI, .315-.819, PIVW=5.51E-03). We found no evidence for total weekly consumption (ORIVW.508, 95% CI.315-.819, PIVW=5.51E-03). Consistency of results across complementary MR methods strengthens our causal inferences.\n\nConclusionsOur findings show low educational attainment is causally associated with increased alcohol consumption frequency, increased preference for beer, cider, and spirits, and AD risk, indicating a potential mechanism explaining reported associations between educational attainment and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest increased educational attainment might be a useful prevention strategy to reduce risky alcohol behaviors and AD.",

    "abstract": "Proteinase 3 (PR3) is a neutrophil serine protease targeted by anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in the autoimmune disease granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)1-5. PR3 mutants were developed to investigate how PR3 interacts with the ANCAs and whether the interactions can be intervened by therapeutics. One mutant with a Ser195Ala mutation (iPR3-Val103) recognized as many ANCAs as wild-type PR3 (PR3-Val103)6-9, indicating that PR3-Val103 and iPR3-Val103 have equivalent ANCA-binding capabilities. A triple mutant of the latter (iHm5-Val103) bound a monoclonal antibody (moANCA518) from a patient with GPA on an epitope remote from the mutation sites. Unexpectedly, the corresponding epitope of iPR3-Val103 was inaccessible to moANCA518 under the same experimental conditions10,11. These observations demonstrate that a latent epitope of PR3 can be activated surprisingly by remote mutations in PR311. Here we report a comparative analysis of simulated B-factors (i.e., measurements of local mobility) of PR3-Val103, iPR3-Val103, and iHm5-Val103, demonstrating that the binding of moANCA518 to iHm5-Val103 is enabled by an increase in main-chain flexibility in the latent epitope caused by the remote muta-tions in iHm5-Val103. This epitope activation--achieved in vitro by remote mutations as we demonstrated or in vivo conceivably by remote protein>>protein interactions12 or remote po-lymorphisms--may be a fundamental feature of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. Rigidifying B-cell epitopes on an autoantigen with therapeutics designed using the B-factor analysis disclosed here may lead to effective treatments for these autoimmune diseases by making the autoantigen inaccessible to existing autoantibodies. This analysis may also be used to predict and characterize epitopes and remote mutation effects.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal influenza viruses are constantly changing, and produce a different set of circulating strains each season. Small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in antigenically different viruses; this may prevent the bodys immune system from recognizing those viruses. Due to rapid mutations, in particular in the hemagglutinin gene, seasonal influenza vaccines must be updated frequently. This requires choosing strains to include in the updates to maximize the vaccines benefits, according to estimates of which strains will be circulating in upcoming seasons. This is a challenging prediction task. In this paper we use longitudinally sampled phylogenetic trees based on hemagglutinin sequences from human influenza viruses, together with counts of epitope site polymorphisms in hemagglutinin, to predict which influenza virus strains are likely to be successful. We extract small groups of taxa (subtrees) and use a suite of features of these subtrees as key inputs to the machine learning tools. Using a range of training and testing strategies, including training on H3N2 and testing on H1N1, we find that successful prediction of future expansion of small subtrees is possible from these data, with accuracies of 0.71-0.85 and a classifier  area under the curve (AUC) 0.75-0.9.",

This personalized learning and mass spectrometry-based approach enables comprehensive and accurate identification of neoantigens. We applied the workflow to datasets of five melanoma patients and substantially improved the accuracy and identification rate of de novo HLA peptides by 14.3% and 38.9%, respectively. This subsequently led to the identification of 10,440 HLA-I and 1,585 HLA-II new peptides that were not presented in existing databases. Most importantly, our workflow successfully discovered 17 neoantigens of both HLA-I and HLA-II, including those with validated T cell responses and those novel neoantigens that had not been reported in previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common genetic disorder that typically involves left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac hypercontractility. Mutations in {beta} cardiac myosin heavy chain ({beta}-MyHC) are a major cause of HCM, but the specific mechanistic changes to myosin function that lead to the disease remain incompletely understood. Predicting the severity of any single {beta}-MyHC mutation is hindered by a lack of detailed evaluation at the molecular level. In addition, since the cardiomyopathy can take 20 or more years to develop, the severity of the mutations must be somewhat subtle. We hypothesized that mutations which result in early onset disease may show more severe molecular changes in function compared to later onset mutations. In this work, we performed steady-state and transient kinetic analyses of myosins carrying 1 of 7 missense mutations in the motor domain. Of these 7, 4 have been identified in early onset cardiomyopathy screens. The derived parameters were used to model the ATP driven cross-bridge cycle. Contrary to our hypothesis, the results show no clear differences between early and late onset HCM mutations. Despite the lack of distinction between early and late onset HCM, the predicted occupancy of the force-holding actin.myosin.ADP complex at [Actin] = 3 Kapp along with the closely related Duty Ratio (DR; fraction of myosin in strongly attached force-holding states) and the measured ATPases all change in parallel (in both sign and degree of change) compared to wild type (WT) values. Six of the 7 HCM mutations are clearly distinct from a set of DCM mutations previously characterized.",

Further, we present a temporal extension to the participation coefficient measure (temporal participation coefficient) that circumnavigates this problem by jointly considering all community partitions assigned to a node through time.

Yet, how agricultural practices, such as the application of either mineral or organic nitrogen fertilisers, impact on the composition and functions of these communities remains to be fully elucidated. By deploying a two-pronged 16S rRNA gene sequencing and predictive metagenomics approach we demonstrated that the bacterial microbiota of field-grown tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants is the product of a selective process that progressively differentiates between rhizosphere and root microhabitats. This process initiates as early as plants are in a nursery stage and it is then more marked at late developmental stages, in particular at harvest. This selection acts on both the bacterial relative abundances and phylogenetic assignments, with a bias for the enrichment of members of the phylum Actinobacteria in the root compartment. Digestate-based and mineral-based nitrogen fertilisers trigger a distinct bacterial enrichment in both rhizosphere and root microhabitats. This compositional diversification mirrors a predicted functional diversification of the root-inhabiting communities, manifested predominantly by the differential enrichment of genes associated to ABC transporters and the two-component system. Together, our data suggest that the microbiota thriving at the tomato root-soil interface is modulated by and in responses to the type of nitrogen fertiliser applied to the field.",

As such, they provide valuable information for supporting memory-guided behavior. Here, we employed single-photon calcium imaging in freely moving mice to investigate the emergence and fate of trajectory-dependent activity through learning and mastery of a continuous spatial alternation task. We found that the quality of trajectory-dependent information in hippocampal neurons correlated with task performance. We thus hypothesized that, due to their utility, splitter neurons would exhibit heightened stability. We found that splitter neurons were more likely to remain active and retained more consistent spatial information across multiple days than did place cells. Furthermore, we found that both splitter neurons and place cells emerged rapidly and maintained stable trajectory-dependent/spatial activity thereafter. Our results suggest that neurons with useful functional coding properties exhibit heightened stability to support memory guided behavior.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical forces control many cellular processes by eliciting a mechanotransduction response in target cells. The initial steps of mechanotransduction at hemidesmosomes remain undefined in contrast to focal adhesions and adherens junctions. Here, we focus on the C. elegans plectin homolog VAB-10A, the only evolutionary conserved hemidesmosome component. In C. elegans, muscle contractions induce a mechanotransduction pathway in the epidermis through hemidesmosomes. We used CRISPR to precisely remove spectrin repeats (SR) or a partially hidden Src-homology-3 (SH3) domain within the VAB-10 plakin domain. Deleting the SH3 or SR8 domains in combination with mutations affecting mechanotransduction, or just part of SR5 shielding the SH3 domain induced embryonic elongation arrest because hemidesmosomes collapse. Notably, recruitment of GIT-1, the first mechanotransduction player, requires the SR5 domain and the hemidesmosome transmembrane receptor LET-805. Furthermore, Molecular Dynamics simulations confirmed that forces acting on VAB-10 can render the central SH3 domain, otherwise in contact with SR4, available for interaction. Collectively, our data strongly argue that the plakin domain plays a central role in mechanotransduction and raise the possibility that VAB-10/plectin might act as a mechanosensor.\\n\\nSummary statementCRISPR-derived deletions reveal the roles of three spectrin repeats and an atypical SH3 domain from the plakin domain of the VAB-10 hemidesmosome component in mechanotransduction during C. elegans morphogenesis",

    "abstract": "Although single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is newly invented and promising one, because of lack of enough information that labels individual cells, it is hard to interpret the obtained gene expression of each cell. Because of this insufficient information available, unsupervised clustering, e.g., t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, is usually employed to obtain low dimensional embedding that can help to understand cell-cell relationship. One possible drawback of this strategy is that the outcome is highly dependent upon genes selected for the usage of clustering. In order to fulfill this requirement, there are many methods that performed unsupervised gene selection. In this study, a tensor decomposition (TD) based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) was applied to the integration of two scRNA-seq expression profiles that measure human and mouse midbrain development. TD based unsupervised FE could not only select coincident genes between human and mouse, but also biologically reliable genes. Coincidence between two species as well as biological reliability of selected genes is increased compared with principal component analysis (PCA) based FE applied to the same data set in the previous study. Since PCA based unsupervised FE outperformed other three popular unsupervised gene selection methods, highly variable genes, bimodal genes and dpFeature, TD based unsupervised FE can do so as well. In addition to this, ten transcription factors (TFs) that might regulate selected genes and might contribute to midbrain development are identified. These ten TFs, BHLHE40, EGR1, GABPA, IRF3, PPARG, REST, RFX5, STAT3, TCF7L2, and ZBTB33, were previously reported to be related to brain functions and diseases. TD based unsupervised FE is a promising method to integrate two scRNA-seq profiles effectively.",

    "abstract": "According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, nearly 115,000 people in the U.S needed a lifesaving organ transplant in 2018, while only [~]10% of them have received it. Yet, almost no artificial FDA-approved products are commercially available today - three decades after the inception of tissue engineering. It is hypothesized here that the major bottlenecks restricting its progress stem from lack of access to the inner pore space of the scaffolds. Specifically, the inability to deliver nutrients to, and clear waste from, the center of the scaffolds limits the size of the products that can be cultured. Likewise, the inability to monitor, and control, the cells after seeding them into the scaffold results in nonviable tissue, with an unacceptable product variability. To resolve these bottlenecks, we present a prototype addressable microfluidics device capable of minimally disruptive fluid and cell manipulations within living cultures. As proof-of-concept, we demonstrate its ability to perform additive manufacturing by seeding cells in spatial patterns (including co-culturing multiple cell types); and subtractive manufacturing by removing surface adherent cells via focused flow of trypsin. Additionally, we show that the device can sample fluids and perform cell \"biopsies\" (which can be subsequently sent for ex-situ analysis), from any location within its Culture Chamber. Finally, the on-chip plumbing is completely automated using external electronics. This opens the possibility to perform long-term computer-driven tissue engineering experiments, where the cell behavior is modulated in response to the minimally disruptive observations (e.g. fluid sampling and cell biopsies) throughout the entire duration of the cultures. It is expected that the proof-of-concept technology will eventually be scaled up to 3D addressable microfluidic scaffolds, capable of overcoming the limitations bottlenecking the transition of tissue engineering technologies to the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "The small GTPase Cdc42 is critical for cell polarization. Scaffold-mediated positive feedback regulation was proposed to mediate symmetry-breaking to a single active zone in budding yeast cells. In rod-shaped fission yeast S. pombe cells, active Cdc42-GTP localizes to both cell poles, where it promotes bipolar growth. Here, we implement the CRY2-CIBN optogenetic system for acute light-dependent protein recruitment to the plasma membrane, which allowed to directly demonstrate positive feedback. Indeed, optogenetic recruitment of constitutively active Cdc42 leads to co-recruitment of the GEF Scd1, in a manner dependent on the scaffold protein Scd2. We show that Scd2 function is completely bypassed and positive feedback restored by an engineered interaction between the GEF and a Cdc42 effector, the Pak1 kinase. Remarkably, such re-wired cells are viable and grow in a bipolar manner even when lacking otherwise essential Cdc42 activators. Interestingly, these cells reveal that Ras1 GTPase plays a dual role in localizing and activating the GEF, thus potentiating the feedback. We conclude that scaffold-mediated positive feedback, gated by Ras activity, is minimally required for rod-shape formation.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine is well known to regulate movement through the differential control of direct and indirect pathways in the striatum that express D1 and D2 receptors respectively. The spinal cord also expresses all dopamine receptors however; how the specific receptors regulate spinal network output in mammals is poorly understood. We explore the receptor-specific mechanisms that underlie dopaminergic control of spinal network output of neonatal mice during changes in spinal network excitability. During spontaneous activity, which is a characteristic of developing spinal networks operating in a low excitability state, we found that dopamine is primarily inhibitory. We uncover an excitatory D1-mediated effect of dopamine on motoneurons and network output that also involves co-activation with D2 receptors. Critically, these excitatory actions require higher concentrations of dopamine; however, analysis of dopamine concentrations of neonates indicates that endogenous levels of spinal dopamine are low. Because endogenous levels of spinal dopamine are low, this excitatory dopaminergic pathway is likely physiologically-silent at this stage in development. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of dopamine, at low physiological concentrations is mediated by parallel activation of D2, D3, D4 and 2 receptors which is reproduced when endogenous dopamine levels are increased by blocking dopamine reuptake and metabolism. We provide evidence in support of dedicated spinal network components that are controlled by excitatory D1 and inhibitory D2 receptors that is reminiscent of the classic dopaminergic indirect and direct pathway within the striatum. These results indicate that network state is an important factor that dictates receptor-specific and therefore dose-dependent control of neuromodulators on spinal network output and advances our understanding of how neuromodulators regulate neural networks under dynamically changing excitability.\\n\\nSignificance statementMonoaminergic neuromodulation of neural networks is dependent not only on target receptors but also on network state. We studied the concentration-dependent control of spinal networks of the neonatal mouse, in vitro, during a low excitability state characterized by spontaneous network activity. Spontaneous activity is an essential element for the development of networks. Under these conditions, we defined converging receptor and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the diverse, concentration-dependent control of spinal motor networks by dopamine, in vitro. These experiments advance understanding of how monoamines modulate neuronal networks under dynamically changing excitability conditions and provide evidence of dedicated D1 and D2 regulated network components in the spinal cord that are consistent with those reported in the striatum.",

The prediction method is based on geometric morphometrics, image analysis, and kernel partial least squares regression. The inputs required are answers to three closed-ended questions and a passport photo. Prediction accuracy was tested with the 3D body scan dataset of the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource project. Results from the test dataset showed that approximately 82% of the error expectations of landmarks followed a log-normal distribution with an expectation of 8.816 mm and standard deviation of 1.180 mm. The remaining 18% of the error expectations of landmarks followed a log-normal distribution with an expectation of 18.454 mm and standard deviation of 8.844 mm, which may herald future research. Benchmarked with another method, the proposed method features much less input. In addition to high accuracy, the method in this paper allows for visualisation of results as real-size meshes in millimeters.",

    "abstract": "The application of statistical methods to comparatively framed questions about protein dynamics can potentially enable investigations of biomolecular function beyond the current sequence and structural methods in bioinformatics. However, chaotic behavior in single protein trajectories requires statistical inference be obtained from large ensembles of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations representing the comparative functional states of a given protein. Meaningful interpretation of such a complex form of big data poses serious challenges to users of MD. Here, we announce DROIDS v3.0, a molecular dynamic (MD) method + software package for comparative protein dynamics, incorporating many new features including maxDemon v1.0, a multi-method machine learning application that trains on large ensemble comparisons of concerted protein motions in opposing functional states and deploys learned classifications of these states onto newly generated protein dynamic simulations. Local canonical correlations in learning patterns generated from self-similar MD runs are used to identify regions of functionally conserved protein dynamics. Subsequent impacts of genetic and drug class variants on conserved dynamics can also be analyzed by deploying the classifiers on variant MD runs and quantifying how often these altered protein systems display the opposing functional states. Here, we present several case studies of complex changes in functional protein dynamics caused by temperature, genetic mutation, and binding interaction with nucleic acids and small molecules. We studied the impact of genetic variation on functionally conserved protein dynamics in ubiquitin and TATA binding protein and demonstrate that our learning algorithm can properly identify regions of conserved dynamics. We also report impacts to dynamics that correspond well with predicted disruptive effects of a variety of genetic mutations. In addition, we studied the impact of drug class variation on the ATP binding region of Hsp90, similarly identifying conserved dynamics and impacts that rank accordingly with how closely various Hsp90 inhibitors mimic natural ATP binding.\\n\\nStatement of significanceWe propose a statistical method as well as offer a user-friendly graphical interfaced software pipeline for comparing simulations of the complex motions (i.e. dynamics) of proteins in different functional states. We also provide both method and software to apply artificial intelligence (i.e. machine learning methods) that enable the computer to recognize complex functional differences in protein dynamics on new simulations and report them to the user. This method can identify dynamics important for protein function, as well as to quantify how the motions of molecular variants differ from these important functional dynamic states. For the first time, this method of analysis allows the impacts of different genetic backgrounds or drug classes to be examined within the context of functional motions of the specific protein system under investigation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGrape berry ripening is influenced by climate, the main component of the \\\"terroir\\\" of a place. Light and temperature are major factors in the vineyard that affect berry development and fruit metabolite composition.\\n\\nResultsTo better understand the effect of \\\"place\\\" on transcript abundance during the late stages of berry ripening, Cabernet Sauvignon berries grown in Bordeaux and Reno were compared at similar sugar levels (19 to 26 {degrees}Brix (total soluble solids)). Day temperatures were warmer and night temperatures were cooler in Reno. {degrees}Brix was lower in Bordeaux berries compared to Reno at maturity levels considered optimum for harvest. RNA-Seq analysis identified 5528 differentially expressed genes between Bordeaux and Reno grape skins at 22{degrees}Brix. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis for all expressed transcripts for all four {degrees}Brix levels measured indicated that the majority (75%) of transcript expression differed significantly between the two locations. Top gene ontology categories for the common transcript sets were translation, photosynthesis, DNA metabolism and catabolism. Top gene ontology categories for the differentially expressed genes at 22{degrees}Brix involved response to stimulus, biosynthesis and response to stress. Some differentially expressed genes encoded terpene synthases, cell wall enzymes, kinases, transporters, transcription factors and photoreceptors. Most circadian clock genes had higher transcript abundance in Bordeaux. Bordeaux berries had higher transcript abundance with differentially expressed genes associated with seed dormancy, light, auxin, ethylene signaling, powdery mildew infection, phenylpropanoid, carotenoid and terpenoid metabolism, whereas Reno berries were enriched with differentially expressed genes involved in water deprivation, cold response, ABA signaling and iron homeostasis.\\n\\nConclusionsTranscript abundance profiles in the berry skins at maturity were highly dynamic. RNA-Seq analysis identified a smaller (25% of total) common core set of ripening genes that appear not to depend on rootstock, vineyard management, plant age, soil and climatic conditions. Much of the gene expression differed between the two locations and could be associated with multiple differences in environmental conditions that may have affected the berries in the two locations; some of these genes may be potentially controlled in different ways by the vinegrower to adjust final berry composition and reach a desired result.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods that infer the function of proteins are key to understanding life at the molecular level. In recent years, representation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to discover new patterns among entities as varied as images, words, speech, molecules. In typical representation learning, there is only one source of data or one level of abstraction at which the learned representation occurs. However, proteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure or even as nodes in protein-protein interaction networks. Given that protein function is an emergent property of all these levels of interactions in this work, we learn joint representations from both amino acid sequence and multilayer networks representing tissue-specific protein-protein interactions. Using these hybrid representations, we show that simple machine learning models trained using these hybrid representations outperform existing network-based methods on the task of tissue-specific protein function prediction on 13 out of 13 tissues. Furthermore, these representations outperform existing ones by 14% on average.",

In support of clinical translation, treatment of human monocyte and T cell co-cultures with a B7-H4 blocking antibody resulted in enhanced IFN-{gamma} secretion by CD4+ and CD8+ T cell. While the study of B7-H4 in mouse cancer models has been difficult using tumor cell lines, our findings show that B7-H4 expression increased at 3 months after exposure to BBN on CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages and delivery of anti-B7-H4 antibody resulted in decreased tumor size and increased CD8 immune cell infiltration with increased CD8+/IFN-{gamma}-producing T cells and a complimentary decrease in tumor infiltrating T regulatory cells (Tregs). Furthermore, treatment with a combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-B7-H4 antibodies resulted in a significant reduction in tumor stage. This data suggests that novel anti-B7-H4 antibodies maybe a viable target for bladder cancers unresponsive to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Achieving multiple cycles of RNA replication within a model protocell would be a critical step towards demonstrating a path from prebiotic chemistry to cellular biology. Any model for early life based on an  RNA world must account for RNA strand cleavage and hydrolysis, which would degrade primitive genetic information and lead to an accumulation of truncated, phosphate-terminated strands. We show here that cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone is not an endpoint for RNA replication. Instead, 3' -phosphate terminated RNA strands are able to participate in template-directed copying reactions with activated ribonucleotide monomers. These reactions form a pyrophosphate linkage, the stability of which we have characterized in the context of RNA copying chemistry. We found that the pyrophosphate bond is relatively stable within an RNA duplex and in the presence of chelated magnesium. Under these conditions, pyrophosphate-RNA can act as a temporary  patch to template the polymerization of canonical ribonucleotides, suggesting a plausible non-enzymatic pathway for the salvage and recovery of genetic information following strand cleavage.",

When we applied the framework to evaluate the three commercial anti-PD1 drugs (Opdivo, Keytruda, and Libtayo), the predicted binding affinities correlate with the real affinities measured in kD values.

    "abstract": "Human centromeres form over arrays of tandemly repeated DNA that are exceptionally complex (repeats of repeats) and long (spanning up to 8 Mbp). They also have an exceptionally rapid rate of evolution. The generally accepted model for the expansion/contraction, homogenization and evolution of human centromeric repeat arrays is a generic model for the evolution of satellite DNA that is based on unequal crossing over between sister chromatids. This selectively neutral model predicts that the sequences of centromeric repeat units will be effectively random and lack functional constraint. Here I used shotgun PacBio SMRT reads from a homozygous human fetal genome (female) to determine and compare the consensus sequences (and levels of intra-array variation) for the active centromeric repeats of all the chromosomes. To include the Y chromosome using the same technology, I used the same type of reads from a diploid male. I found many different forms and levels of conserved structure that are not predicted by -and sometimes contradictory to- the unequal crossing over model. Much of this structure is based on spatial organization of three types of ~170 bp monomeric repeat units that are predicted to influence centromere strength (i.e., the level of outer kinetochore proteins): one with a protein-binding sequence at its 5 end (a 17 bp b-box that binds CENP-B), a second that is identical to the first except that the b-box is mutated so that it no longer binds CENP-B, and a third lacking a b-box but containing a 19 bp conserved \"n-box\" sequence near its 5 end. The frequency and organization of these monomer types change markedly as the number of monomers per repeat unit increases, and also differs between inactive and active arrays. Active arrays are also much longer than flanking, inactive arrays, and far longer than required for cellular functioning. The diverse forms of structure motivate a new hypothesis for the lifecycle of human centromeric sequences. These multifarious levels of structures, and other lines of evidence, collectively indicate that a new model is needed to explain the form, function, expansion/contraction, homogenization and rapid evolution of centromeric sequences.",

Horseradish peroxidase, commonly used in CARD to amplify reporter signals, requires the addition of hydrogen peroxide which may perturb samples used in live-cell microscopy. Herein we describe an alternative method of performing CARD using a laccase enzyme, which does not require exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Laccase is an oxidative enzyme which can carry out single-electron oxidations of phenols and related compounds by reducing molecular oxygen. We demonstrate proof-of-concept for this technique through the non-targeted covalent labeling of bovine serum albumin using a fluorescently-labeled ferulic acid derivative as the laccase reporter substrate. We further demonstrate the viability of this approach by performing live-cell CARD with an antibody-conjugated laccase against a surface bound target. CARD using laccase produces an amplified fluorescence signal by labeling cells without the need for exogenous hydrogen peroxide.",

Regardless of experimental aims, fitness assays are a central component of this type of research, and low-throughput often limits the scope and complexity of experimental evolution studies. We created an experimental evolution system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that utilizes genetic barcoding to overcome this challenge.\n\nResultsWe first confirm that barcode insertions do not alter fitness and that barcode sequencing can be used to efficiently detect fitness differences via pooled competition-based fitness assays. Next, we examine the effects of ploidy, chemical stress, and population bottleneck size on the evolutionary dynamics and fitness gains (adaptation) in a total of 76 experimentally evolving, asexual populations by conducting 1,216 fitness assays and analyzing 532 longitudinal-evolutionary samples collected from the evolving populations. In our analysis of these data we describe the strengths of this experimental evolution system and explore sources of error in our measurements of fitness and evolutionary dynamics.\n\nConclusionsOur experimental treatments generated distinct fitness effects and evolutionary dynamics, respectively quantified via multiplexed fitness assays and barcode lineage tracking. These findings demonstrate the utility of this new resource for designing and improving high-throughput studies of experimental evolution. The approach described here provides a framework for future studies employing experimental designs that require high-throughput multiplexed fitness measurements.",

    "abstract": "Timely response to outbreak of water-borne diseases caused by bacteria requires efficient monitoring and rapid detection strategies. Herein, we report a rapid DNA-based on-site detection system for specific detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To evaluate the test performance of our method against spiked water samples, parallel tests based on real-time PCR and standard culture methods were concurrently performed. Test sensitivities of between 96.7% and 92.3% were obtained, based on the calculation obtained from qPCR and culture test, respectively, with a corresponding level of specificity of 92.9% and 83.3%. Time-to-result is around 45 min, with a detection limit of 1 CFU/100 mL. Here, a fully-deployable detection method where bacteria of-interest can be detected rapidly with high accuracy was described. This test method can be modified to detect other bacteria of-interest and can also be used in different applications. The test results can be obtained on-site and can therefore be particularly useful in public facilities health surveillance, where regulators can quickly determine if a site is safe or if other emergency response measures are required.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a well-established water quality biomarker, known to be associated to humans health risks. To ascertain the presence of this pathogen, relevant stakeholders currently rely on standard quantitative ISO methods (APHA 9213E) which require 6 days from sampling to results. This window could potentially lead to waterborne outbreaks if the contaminated water features are not shut down for proper and urgent mitigation. This manuscript describes a method to detect this disease-causing microorganism in its viable forms under 1 hour, with a sensitivity of 1 CFU/100mL. Besides providing valuable information of the quality of water system, this direct monitoring of pathogens can reduce substantial time needed from sampling to reporting. This method can be established as a platform technology for other pathogenic microorganisms. On-going work to develop economic point-of-care prototypes could facilitate quick screening of targeted waterborne pathogens and results in better assessment of public health risk and quick in devising emergency response measures and other management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in all age groups. The recent finding that HuNoV can be propagated in B cells and mucosa derived intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs), has transformed our capability to dissect the life cycle of noroviruses. Using RNA-Seq of HuNoV infected intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), we have found that replication of HuNoV in IECs results in interferon-induced transcriptional responses and that HuNoV replication in IECs is sensitive to IFN. This contrasts with previous studies that suggest that the innate immune response may play no role in the restriction of HuNoV replication in immortalised cells. We demonstrate that the inhibition of JAK1/JAK2 enhances HuNoV replication in IECs. Surprisingly, targeted inhibition of cellular RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription was not detrimental to HuNoV replication, but enhanced replication to a greater degree compared to blocking of JAK signalling directly. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that IECs generated from genetically modified intestinal organoids, engineered to be deficient in the interferon response, are more permissive to HuNoV infection. Together our work identifies the IFN-induced transcriptional responses restrict HuNoV replication in IECs and demonstrates that the inhibition of these responses by modifications to the culture conditions can greatly enhance the robustness of the norovirus culture system.\\n\\nImportanceNoroviruses are a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide yet the challenges associated with their growth culture has greatly hampered the development of therapeutic approaches and has limited our understanding of cellular pathways that control infection. Here we show that human intestinal epithelial cells, the first point of entry of human noroviruses into the host, limit virus replication by the induction of the innate responses. Furthermore we show that modulating the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to induce transcriptional responses to HuNoV infection can significantly enhance human norovirus replication in culture. Collectively our findings provide new insights into the biological pathways that control norovirus infection but also identify mechanisms to enhance the robustness of norovirus culture.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris has become a global public health threat due to its multidrug resistance and persistence in hospital and nursing home settings. Although a skin colonizer, C. auris can cause fatal bloodstream infections and most patients succumb to multi-organ failure. Currently, there are limited animal models to study the progression of C. auris infection. Here we compare two murine models of neutrophil depletion using monoclonal antibodies 1A8, anti-Ly6G+ and RB6-8C5 anti-Ly6G+-Ly6C+. We also compare inoculums of 107 and 108 as well as the intravenous and gavage routes of infection. The results reveal that neutrophil depletion in BALB/c mice is sustained long-term with the 1A8 antibody and short-term with RB6-8C5. Target organs were kidney, heart and brain as these had the highest organ fungal burden in neutrophil depleted and to some extent in infected control mice. We found that C. auris is shed in urine and feces for neutrophil depleted mice. The gavage model is not an ideal route as dissemination was not detected. Eight days post C. auris infection all surviving mice display a unique behavioral phenotype characterized by torticollis and tail spin that progresses to head bobbing and body curling like phenotype by day 22, that continues to persist even 104 days post infection. Lastly, we found C. auris remains in tissues of infected control mice, 34 plus days post infection suggesting that C. auris stays present in the host without causing disease but becomes opportunistic upon a change in the hosts immune status such as neutrophil depletion.",

We find that the hierarchy of reactions is reflected in experimental measurements of transcript, protein and flux levels of Escherichia coli under various growth conditions as well as in the catalytic rate constants of the corresponding enzymes. Our findings point at resource partitioning and a fine-tuning of enzyme levels in E. coli to respect the constraints imposed by the network structure at steady state.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an important tool to unravel cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell types, and understand cell development at single-cell resolution. However, one major challenge to scRNA-seq research is the presence of \\\"drop-out\\\" events, which usually is due to extremely low mRNA input or the stochastic nature of gene expression. In this paper, we present a novel Single-Cell RNA-seq Drop-Out Correction (scDoc) method, imputing drop-out events by borrowing information for the same gene from highly similar cells. scDoc is the first method that involves drop-out information to account for cell-to-cell similarity estimation, which is crucial in scRNA-seq drop-out imputation but has not been appropriately examined. We evaluated the performance of scDoc using both simulated data and real scRNA-seq studies. Results show that scDoc can impute the drop-out events more accurately and robustly; specifically, it outperforms all available imputation methods in reference to data visualization, cell subpopulation identification, and differential expression detection in scRNA-seq data.",

    "abstract": "Human centromeres are remarkable in four ways: they are i) defined epigenetically by an elevated concentration of the histone H3 variant CENP-A, ii) inherited epigenetically by trans-generational cary-over of nucleosomes containing CENP-A, iii) formed over unusually long and complex tandem repeats (Higher Order Repeats, HORs) that extend over exceptionally long arrays of DNA (up to 8 Mb), and iv) evolve in such a rapid and punctuated manner that most HORs on orthologous chimp and human chromosomes are in different clades. What molecular and evolutionary processes generated these distinctive characteristics? Here I motivate and construct a new model for the formation, expansion/contraction, homogenization and rapid evolution of human centromeric repeat arrays that is based on fork-collapse during DNA replication (in response to proteins bound to DNA and/or collisions between DNA and RNA polymerases) followed by out-of-register re-initiation of replication via Break-Induced Repair (BIR). The model represents a new form of molecular drive. It predicts rapid and sometimes punctuated evolution of centromeric HORs due to a new form of intragenomic competition that is based on two features: i) the rate of tandem copy number expansion, and ii) resistance to invasion by pericentric heterochromatin within a centromeres HOR array. These features determine which variant array elements will eventually occupy a pivotal region within a centromeric repeat array (switch-point) that gradually expands to populate the entire array. In humans, continuous HOR turnover is predicted due to intra-array competition between three repeat types with an intransitive hierarchy: A < B < C < A, where A = short, single-dimer HORs containing one monomer that binds centromere protein-B (CENP-B) and another that does not, B = moderately longer HORs composed of [&ge;] 2 dimers, and C = substantially longer HORs that lose their dimeric modular structure. Continuous turnover of proteins that bind centromeric DNA (but these proteins are not constituents of the kinetochore) and polygenic variation influencing position-effect variegation are predicted to cause rapid turnover of centromeric repeats in species lacking HORs and/or CENP-B binding at centromeres. Evolution at centromeres is a molecular  Game-of-Thrones because centromeric sequences  reign due to an epigenetic  crown of CENP-A that is perpetually  usurped by new sequences that more rapidly assemble large  armies of tandem repeats and/or resist  invasion from a surrounding  frontier of percentric heterochromatin. These  regal transitions occur in a backdrop of slashing and decapitation (fork-collapse generating truncated sister chromatids) in the context of promiscuous sex that is frequently incestuous (out-of-register BIR between sibling chromatids).",

    "abstract": "Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a Mendelian disease characterized by vascular malformations including visceral arteriovenous malformations and mucosal telangiectasia. HHT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one of 3 genes; ENG, ACVRL1 or SMAD4 and is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Intriguingly, the constitutional mutation causing HHT is present throughout the body, yet the multiple vascular malformations in HHT patients occur focally, rather than manifesting as a systemic vascular defect. This disconnect between genotype and phenotype suggests that a local event is necessary for the development of vascular malformations. We investigated the hypothesis that local somatic mutations seed the formation HHT-related telangiectasia in a genetic two-hit mechanism. We identified low-frequency somatic mutations in 9/19 telangiectasia using high depth next-generation sequencing. We established phase for 7 of 9 samples using long-read sequencing, which confirm that the germline and somatic mutations in all 7 samples exist in trans configuration; consistent with a genetic two-hit mechanism. These combined data suggest that biallelic loss of ENG or ACVRL1 may be a required event in the development of telangiectasia, and that rather than haploinsufficiency, vascular malformations in HHT are caused by a Knudsonian two-hit mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Attentional modulation of neuronal activity in sensory cortex could alter perception by enhancing the local representation of attended stimuli or its behavioral read-out downstream. We tested these hypotheses using a task in which mice are cued on interleaved trials to attend visual or auditory targets. Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) that encode task stimuli have larger visually-evoked responses when attention is directed toward vision. To determine whether the attention-dependent changes in V1 reflect changes in representation or read-out, we decoded task stimuli and choices from population activity. Surprisingly, both visual and auditory choices can be decoded from V1, but decoding takes advantage of unique activity patterns across modalities. Furthermore, decoding of choices, but not stimuli, is impaired when attention is directed toward the opposite modality. The specific effect on choice suggests behavioral improvements with attention are largely due to targeted read-out of the most informative V1 neurons.",

    "abstract": "Humans have the fascinating ability to achieve goals in a complex and constantly changing world, still surpassing modern machine learning algorithms in terms of flexibility and learning speed. It is generally accepted that a crucial factor for this ability is the use of abstract, hierarchical representations, which employ structure in the environment to guide learning and decision making. Nevertheless, how we create and use these hierarchical representations is poorly understood. This study presents evidence that human behavior can be characterized as hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL). We designed an experiment to test specific predictions of hierarchical RL using a series of subtasks in the realm of context-based learning, and observed several behavioral markers of hierarchical RL, such as asymmetric switch costs between changes in higher-level versus lower-level features, faster learning in higher-valued compared to lower-valued contexts, and preference for higher-valued compared to lower-valued contexts. We replicated these results across three independent samples. We simulated three models: a classic RL, a hierarchical RL, and a hierar-chical Bayesian model, and compared their behavior to human results. While the flat RL model captured some aspects of participants sensitivity to outcome values, and the hierarchical Bayesian model some markers of transfer, only hierarchical RL accounted for all patterns observed in human behavior. This work shows that hierarchical RL, a biologically-inspired and computationally simple algorithm, can capture human behavior in complex, hierarchical environments, and opens the avenue for future research in this field.",

We analyzed relationships between neurocognitive performance, symptom domains, and diagnoses, in a large sample of SMI cases (ascertained agnostic to diagnosis) and healthy controls from a single, homogeneous population.\n\nMethods2,406 participants (1,689 cases, 717 controls; mean age 39 years, 64% female) were assessed for speed and accuracy using the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB). Cases carried structured-interview based diagnoses of schizophrenia (SCZ, n=160), bipolar-I (BP-I, n=519), bipolar-II (BP-II, n=204) and major depressive disorder (MDD, n=806). Linear mixed models, using CNB tests as repeated measures, modeled neurocognition as a function of diagnosis, sex, and all interactions. Follow-up analyses, in cases, included symptom factor scores obtained from exploratory factor analysis of symptom data, as main effects.\n\nFindingsBP-I and SCZ displayed nearly identical impairments in accuracy and speed, across cognitive domains. BP-II and MDD performed similarly to controls, with subtle deficits in executive and social cognition. A three-factor model (psychosis, mania, and depression) best represented symptom data. Controlling for diagnosis, premorbid IQ, and disease severity, high lifetime psychosis scores were associated with reduced accuracy and speed across cognitive domains, while high depression scores were associated with increased social cognition accuracy.\n\nInterpretationTrans-diagnostic investigations demonstrated that neurocognitive function in SMI is characterized by two distinct profiles (BP-I/SCZ and BP-II/MDD), and is associated with specific symptom domains.

These structures revealed that the transducer module bridges the NO sensor module and the catalytic module. NO binding to the {beta}1 H-NOX domain triggers the structural rearrangement of the sensor module and the bending-straightening conformational switch of the transducer module. The resulting movement of the N-termini of the catalytic domains drives the structural changes within the catalytic module, which in turn boost sGC enzymatic activity.

    "abstract": "Variation in among-family transcriptional responses to different environmental conditions can help to identify adaptive genetic variation, even prior to a selective event. Coupling differential gene expression with formal survival analyses allows for the disentanglement of treatment effects, required for understanding how individuals plastically respond to environmental stressors, from the adaptive genetic variation responsible for among-family variation in survival and gene expression. We applied this experimental design to investigate responses to an emerging conservation issue, thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, in a threatened population of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Thiamine is an essential vitamin that is increasingly limited in many ecosystems. In Lake Champlain, Atlantic salmon cannot acquire thiamine in sufficient quantities to support natural reproduction; fertilized eggs must be reared in hatcheries and treated with supplemental thiamine. We evaluated transcriptional responses (RNA-seq) to thiamine treatment across families and found 3,616 genes differentially expressed between control (no supplemental thiamine) and treatment individuals. Fewer genes changed expression additively (i.e., equally among families) than non-additively (i.e., family-by-treatment effects) in response to thiamine. Differentially expressed genes were related to known physiological effects of thiamine deficiency, including oxidative stress, cardiovascular irregularities, and neurological abnormalities. We also identified 1,446 putatively adaptive genes that were strongly associated with among-family survival in the absence of thiamine treatment, many of which related to neurogenesis and visual perception. Our results highlight the utility of coupling RNA-seq with formal survival analyses to identify candidate genes that underlie the among-family variation in survival required for an adaptive response to natural selection.",

For example, intracellular replication of the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila in macrophages is potently curtailed by IFN{gamma}, but consistent with prior results, no individual genetic deficiency we tested compromised IFN{gamma}-mediated control. Intriguingly, however, we observed that the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) partially rescued L. pneumophila replication in IFN{gamma}-treated macrophages. 2DG inhibits glycolysis and triggers the unfolded protein response, but unexpectedly, it appears these effects are not responsible for perturbing the antimicrobial activity of IFN{gamma}. Instead, we found that 2DG rescues bacterial replication predominantly by inhibiting the induction of two key antimicrobial factors, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and immune responsive gene 1 (IRG1). Using immortalized and primary macrophages deficient in iNOS and IRG1, we confirm that loss of both iNOS and IRG1, but not individual deficiency in each gene, partially reduces IFN{gamma}-mediated restriction of L. pneumophila. Further, using a combinatorial CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis approach, we find that mutation of iNOS and IRG1 in combination with four other genes (CASP11, IRGM1, IRGM3 and NOX2) results in a total loss of L. pneumophila restriction by IFN{gamma} in primary bone marrow macrophages. There are few, if any, other examples in which the complete set of cell-intrinsic factors required for IFN{gamma}-mediated restriction of an intracellular bacterial pathogen have been genetically identified. Our results highlight the combinatorial strategy used by hosts to block the exploitation of macrophages by pathogens.\\n\\nImportanceLegionella pneumophila is one example among many species of pathogenic bacteria that replicate within mammalian macrophages during infection. The immune signaling factor interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) blocks L. pneumophila replication in macrophages and is an essential component of the immune response to L. pneumophila and other intracellular pathogens. However, to date, no study has determined the exact molecular factors induced by IFN{gamma} that are required for its activity. We generated macrophages lacking different combinations of IFN{gamma}-induced genes in an attempt to find a genetic background in which there is a complete loss of IFN{gamma}-mediated restriction of L. pneumophila. We successfully identified six genes that comprise the totality of the IFN{gamma}-dependent restriction of L. pneumophila replication in macrophages. Our results clarify the molecular basis underlying the potent effects of IFN{gamma} and highlight how redundancy downstream of IFN{gamma} is key to prevent exploitation of the macrophage niche by pathogens.",

Here, we systematically integrated extensive data recording epigenetic features and transcriptomes from many sources, including individual laboratories and consortia, to produce a comprehensive view of the regulatory landscape of differentiating hematopoietic cell types in mouse. By employing IDEAS as our Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System, we identified and assigned epigenetic states simultaneously along chromosomes and across cell types, precisely and comprehensively. Combining nuclease accessibility and epigenetic states produced a set of over 200,000 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) that efficiently capture enhancers and promoters. The transitions in epigenetic states of these cCREs across cell types provided insights into mechanisms of regulation, including decreases in numbers of active cCREs during differentiation of most lineages, transitions from poised to active or inactive states, and shifts in nuclease accessibility of CTCF-bound elements. Regression modeling of epigenetic states at cCREs and gene expression produced a versatile resource to improve selection of cCREs potentially regulating target genes.

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, forming symbiotic associations with land plants, are obligate symbionts that cannot complete their natural life cycle without a host. Recently, fatty acid auxotrophy of AM fungi is supported by studies showing that lipids synthesized by the host plants are transferred to the fungi and that the latter lack genes encoding cytosolic fatty acid synthases (1-7). Therefore, to establish an asymbiotic cultivation system for AM fungi, we tried to identify the fatty acids that could promote biomass production. To determine whether AM fungi can grow on medium supplied with fatty acids or lipids under asymbiotic conditions, we tested eight saturated or unsaturated fatty acids (C12-C18) and two {beta}-monoacylglycerols. Only myristate (C14:0) led to an increase in biomass of Rhizophagus irregularis, inducing extensive hyphal growth and formation of infection-competent secondary spores. However, such spores were smaller than those generated symbiotically. Furthermore, we demonstrated that R. irregularis can take up fatty acids in its branched hyphae and use myristate as a carbon and energy source. Myristate also promoted the growth of Rhizophagus clarus and Gigaspora margarita. Finally, mixtures of myristate and palmitate accelerated fungal growth and induced a substantial change in fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol compared with single myristate application, although palmitate was not used as a carbon source for cell wall biosynthesis in this culture system. In conclusion, here we demonstrate that myristate boosts asymbiotic growth of AM fungi and can also serve as a carbon and energy source.\n\nSignificance statementThe origins of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which form symbiotic associations with land plants, date back over 460 million years ago. During evolution, these fungi acquired an obligate symbiotic lifestyle, and thus depend on their host for essential nutrients. In particular, fatty acids are regarded as crucial nutrients for the survival of AM fungi owing to the absence of genes involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in the AM fungal genomes that have been sequenced so far. Here, we show that myristate initiates AM fungal growth under asymbiotic conditions. These findings will advance pure culture of AM fungi.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) can damage genomes, thus organisms employ a variety of mechanisms to repress TE expression. However, these mechanisms often fail over time leading to de-repression of TEs in aging tissues. The PIWI-piRNA pathway is a small RNA pathway that represses TE expression in the germline of animals. Here we explore the function of the pathway in the epithelial stem cells of Hydra, a long-lived freshwater cnidarian. Hydra have three stem cell populations; endodermal and ectodermal epithelial stem cells are strictly somatic, whereas the interstitial stem cells retain germline competence. In our previous study, we found that the PIWI proteins are expressed in all three Hydra stem cell types. In this study, we focus on the ectodermal and endodermal epithelial stem cells to understand the somatic function of the pathway. We isolated piRNAs from Hydra that lack the interstitial lineage and found that these somatic piRNAs map predominantly to TE transcripts and display the conserved sequence signatures typical of germline piRNAs. Three lines of evidence suggest that the PIWI-piRNA pathway represses TEs in Hydra epithelial stem cells. First, epithelial knockdown of the Hydra PIWI protein hywi resulted in upregulation of TE expression. Second, degradome sequencing revealed evidence of PIWI-mediated cleavage of TE RNAs in epithelial cells using the ping-pong mechanism. Finally, we demonstrated a direct association between Hywi protein and TE transcripts in epithelial cells using RNA immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, we found that RNAi knockdown of hywi leads to an upregulation of genes involved in innate immunity, which may be in response to TE upregulation; this is consistent with recent studies on TE expression in mammalian cells. Altogether, this study suggests a function for the PIWI-piRNA pathway in maintaining the long-lived somatic cell lineages of Hydra and may point to a broader role for this pathway in protecting somatic tissue from TE-induced damage.",

Here, we determined that IHCs fired asynchronous Ca2+ APs also in the absence of Ca2+ activity in the GER. Patch clamp recordings from IHCs isolated from the rest of the sensory epithelium confirmed that this firing activity is an intrinsic property of immature IHCs. However, frequency, correlation index and burst duration of IHC APs increased significantly during Ca2+ wave propagation in NSCs, and depended on wave extension in the GER. Furthermore, IHC depolarization under whole cell patch clamp conditions triggered Ca2+ signals in nearby NSCs with a delay that was proportional to the distance from the stimulated IHC. Thus the immature mammalian cochlea supports bidirectional exchange of Ca2+ signals between IHCs and NSCs.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTIn inner hair cells of the developing mammalian cochlea, Ca2+ action potentials are both intrinsic and bidirectionally coupled to the ATP-dependent Ca2+ signaling of the surrounding non-sensory cells.",

Efforts to characterize the LCs function in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging have been hampered by its small size and location near a large source of noise, the fourth ventricle. We tested whether the ability to characterize LC function is improved by employing neuromelanin-T1 weighted images (nmT1) for LC localization and multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (ME-fMRI) for estimating intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC). Analyses indicated that, relative to a probabilistic atlas, utilizing nmT1 images to individually localize the LC increases the specificity of seed time series and clusters in the iFC maps. When combined with independent components analysis (ME-ICA), ME-fMRI data provided significant gains in the temporal signal to noise ratio relative to denoised single-echo (1E) data. The effects of acquiring nmT1 images and ME-fMRI data did not appear to only reflect increases in power: iFC maps for each approach only moderately overlapped. This is consistent with findings that ME-fMRI offers substantial advantages over 1E data acquisition and denoising. It also suggests that individually identifying LC with nmT1 scans is likely to reduce the influence of other nearby brainstem regions on estimates of LC function.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIManual tracing of locus coeruleus increased specificity of seed time series\\nC_LIO_LIManual tracing of locus coeruleus increased specificity of intrinsic connectivity\\nC_LIO_LIMulti-echo fMRI increased temporal signal-to-noise ratio compared to single-echo fMRI\\nC_LIO_LIConnectivity maps across methodologies overlapped only moderately\\nC_LIO_LIMeasurement of LC function benefits from multi-echo fMRI and tracing ROIs\\nC_LI",

We have investigated the effect of sexual dimorphism on the blood lipidome profile in three large population level studies - the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative - ADNI (n =806), the GeneBank Functional Cardio-Metabolomics cohort (n= 1015) and the Genetics of Lipid lowering Drugs and Diet Network - GOLDN (n=422). In total, 355 unique lipids from 15 lipid classes were detected across all three studies using LC-MS. Sixty percent of these lipids differed between men and women in all three cohorts, and up to 87% of all lipids demonstrated sex differences in at least one cohort. ChemRICH enrichment statistics on lipid classes showed that phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, ceramides, sphingomyelins and cholesterol esters were found at higher levels in female subjects while triacylglycerols and lysophosphatidylcholines were found at higher levels in male participants across the three cohorts. This strong sex effect on the blood lipidome suggests that specific regulatory mechanisms may exist that regulate lipid metabolism in a different manner between men and women. Cohort studies involving blood lipidomics should consider separate analyses for male and female participants instead of combined analyses treating sex as a confounding factor.",

While intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of motor activity exists, what governs the overall distribution of activated motor-cargo complexes within cells remains unclear. Here, we utilize in vitro reconstitution of purified motor proteins and non-enzymatic microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to demonstrate that these MAPs exhibit distinct influences on the motility of the three main classes of transport motors: kinesin-1, kinesin-3, and cytoplasmic dynein. Further, we dissect how combinations of MAPs affect motors, and reveal how transient interactions between MAPs and motors may promote these effects. From these data, we propose a general \\\"MAP code\\\" that has the capacity to strongly bias directed movement along microtubules and helps elucidate the intricate intracellular sorting observed in highly polarized cells such as neurons.",

    "abstract": "Wind is a critical factor in the ecology of pollinating insects such as bees. However, the role of wind in determining patterns of bee abundance and floral visitation rates across space and time is not well understood. Orchid bees are an important and diverse group of neotropical pollinators that harvest pollen, nectar and resin from plants. In addition, male orchid bees collect volatile scents that they store in special chambers in their hind legs, and for which the wind-based dispersal of odors may play a particularly crucial role. Here we take advantage of this specialized scent foraging behavior to study the effects of wind on orchid bee visitation at scent sources in a fragmented tropical forest ecosystem. We find that temporal changes in wind speed and turbulence are correlated with visitation to scent stations within sites, while local landscape structure is a strong determinant of spatial variation in visitation across nearby sites. These results suggest that the increased dispersal of attractive scents provided by wind and turbulence outweighs any biomechanical or energetic costs that might deter bees from foraging in these conditions. Overall, our results highlight the significance of wind in the ecology of these important pollinators in neotropical forests.",

    "abstract": "Environmental variation along the geographical space can shape populations by natural selection. In the context of global warming, accompanied by substantial changes in precipitation regimes, it is crucial to understand the role of environmental heterogeneity in tropical trees adaptation, given their disproportional contribution to water and carbon biogeochemical cycles. Here we investigated how heterogeneity in freshwater availability along tropical wetlands has influenced molecular variations of the Black-Mangrove (Avicennia germinans). Fifty-seven trees were sampled in seven sites differing markedly on precipitation regime and riverine freshwater inputs. Using 2,297 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphic markers, we found signatures of natural selection by the genotype association with the precipitation of the warmest quarter and the annual precipitation. We also found candidate loci for selection, based on statistical deviations from neutral expectations of interpopulation differentiation. Most candidate loci present within coding sequences were functionally associated with central aspects of drought-tolerance or plant response to drought. Complementarily, our results suggest the occurrence of rapid evolution of a population, likely in response to sudden and persistent limitation in plant access to soil water, following a road construction in 1974. Observations supporting rapid evolution included reduction in tree size and changes in allele frequencies and in transcripts expression levels associated with increased drought-tolerance, through accumulation of osmoprotectants and antioxidants, biosynthesis of plant cuticle, protection against stress-induced proteins degradation, stomatal closure, photorespiration and photosynthesis. We describe a major role of spatial heterogeneity in freshwater availability in the specialization of this typically tropical tree.",

    "abstract": "The human brain can rapidly form representations of numerical magnitude, whether presented with symbolic stimuli like digits and words or non-symbolic stimuli like dot displays. Little is known about the relative time course of these symbolic and non-symbolic number representations. We investigated the emergence of number representations for three stimulus formats - digits, words, and dot arrays - by applying multivariate pattern analysis to MEG recordings from 22 participants. We first conducted within-format classification to identify the time course by which individual numbers can be decoded from the MEG signal. Peak classification accuracy for individual numbers in all three formats occurred around 110 ms after stimulus onset. Next, we used between-format classification to determine the time course of shared number representations between stimulus formats. Classification accuracy between formats was much weaker than within format classification, but it was also significant at early time points, around 100 ms for both digit / dot and digit / word comparisons. We then used representational similarity analysis to determine if we could explain variance in the MEG representational geometry using two models: a GIST feature model capturing low-level visual properties and an approximate number model capturing the numerical magnitude of the stimuli. Model RSA results differed between stimulus formats: while the GIST model explained unique variance from 100-300 ms for all number formats, the performance of the approximate number model differed between formats. Together, these results are consistent with the view that distinct, format-specific number representations, moreso than a single \\\"abstract\\\" number representation, form the basis of numerical comparison.",

Mangroves soil samples were collected from 12 locations of Arabian Sea coast of Maharashtra, India. 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region amplicon sequencing was performed using the Miseq Illumina platform to identify the microbial communities present in the mangroves ecosystem. The metagenomics analysis provided an insight into the abundance, diversity and spatial variations in the mangrove microbial communities in relation to physico-chemical parameters and revealed that Proteobacteria, Flavobacteria and Planctomycetes are abundant in mangroves system. The differences in bacterial abundance, composition and diversity can partly be attributed to the physico-chemical characteristics of the samples, geographical location and anthropogenic activities in the locality. High numbers of sulphate reducing bacteria accompanied with methanogen bacteria were characteristic of Indian mangroves. The results obtained in the current study indicate rich species diversity and add valuable insights about the diversity of microbial communities of the mangroves in Maharashtra along the west coast of India and can provide better information for effective measures for conservation of mangroves. GIS based prediction suggest that the sulphur utilizing communities are under threat from anthropogenic activities and may decline in future if immediate measures are not implemented.",
