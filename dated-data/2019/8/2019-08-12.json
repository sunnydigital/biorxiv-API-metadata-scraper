    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common pathogen that is responsible of serious illnesses hospital acquired infection as ventilator associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndrome. Also it is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistant mechanisms. generally affects the immuonocompromised but can also infect the immunocompetent as in hot tub folliculitis. There is no vaccine against it available till now. This study predicts an effective epitope-based vaccine against Fructose bisphosphate aladolase (FBA) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using immunoinformatics tools. The sequences were obtained from NCBI and prediction tests took place to analyze possible epitopes for B and T cells. Three B cell epitopes passed the antigenicity, accessibility and hydrophilicity tests. Six MHC I epitopes were the most promising, while four from MHC II. Nineteen epitopes were shared between MHC I and II. For the population coverage, the epitopes covered 95.62% of the alleles worldwide excluding certain MHC II alleles. We recommend invivo and invitro studies to prove its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHuman activities have led to increased deposition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) into soils. Nutrient enrichment of soils is known to increase plant biomass and rates of microbial litter decomposition. However, interacting effects of hydrologic position and associated changes to soil moisture can constrain microbial activity and lead to unexpected nutrient feedbacks on microbial community structure-function relationships. Examining how feedbacks of nutrient enrichment on decomposition rates is essential for predicting microbial contributions to carbon (C) cycling as atmospheric deposition of nutrients persists. This study explores how long-term nutrient addition and contrasting litter chemical quality influence soil bacterial community structure and function. We hypothesize that long-term nutrient enrichment of low fertility soils alters bacterial community structure and leads to higher rates of litter decomposition with decreasing C:N ratio of litter; but low nutrient and dry conditions limit constrain microbial decomposition of high C:N ratio litter. We leverage a long-term fertilization experiment to test how nutrient enrichment and hydrologic manipulation (due to ditches) affects decomposition and soil bacterial community structure in a nutrient poor coastal plain wetland. We conducted a litter bag experiment and characterized litter-associated and bulk soil microbiomes using 16S rRNA bacterial sequencing and quantified litter mass losses and soil physicochemical properties. Results revealed that distinct bacterial communities were involved in decomposing higher C:N ratio litter more quickly in fertilized compared to unfertilized especially under drier soil conditions, while decomposition rates of green tea litter (lower C:N ratio) were similar between fertilized and unfertilized plots. Bacterial community structure in part explained litter decomposition rates, and long-term fertilization and drier hydrologic status affected bacterial diversity and increased decomposition rates. However, community composition associated with high C:N litter was similar in wetter plots with available nitrate detected, regardless of fertilization treatment. This study provides insight into long-term fertilization effects on soil bacterial diversity and composition, decomposition, and the increased potential for soil C loss as nutrient enrichment and hydrology interact to affect historically low nutrient ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Soil health and sustainability is essential for ecosystem functioning and human well-being. Soil structure, the complex arrangement of soil into aggregates and pore spaces, is a key feature of soils under the influence of soil life. Soil biota, and among them filamentous saprobic fungi, have well-documented effects on soil aggregation. However, it is unclear what fungal properties, or traits, contribute to the overall positive effect on soil aggregation. So far, we lack a systematic investigation of a broad suite of fungal species for their trait expression and the relation of these traits to their soil aggregation capability.\\n\\nHere, we apply a trait-based approach to a set of 15 traits measured under standardized conditions on 31 fungal strains including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycota, all isolated from the same soil.\\n\\nWe found a spectrum of soil aggregate formation capability ranging from neutral to positive and large differences in trait expression among strains. We identified biomass density (positive effects), leucine aminopeptidase activity (negative effects) and phylogeny as important modulators of fungal aggregate formation capability. Our results point to a typical suite of traits characterizing fungi that are good soil aggregators; this could inform screening for fungi to be used in biotechnological applications, and illustrates the power of employing a trait-based approach to unravel biological mechanisms of soil aggregation, which could now be extended to other organism groups.",

Thus, it is important to identify major sources of these so-called \\\"batch effects\\\" to eliminate them from study design. Based on the different chemistries of \\\"classic\\\" phenol extraction of RNA compared to common commercial RNA isolation kits, we hypothesized that specific mRNAs may be preferentially extracted depending upon method, which could masquerade as differential expression in downstream RNA-seq analyses. We tested this hypothesis and found that phenol extraction preferentially isolated membrane-associated mRNAs, thus resulting in spurious signals of differential expression. Within a self-contained experimental batch (e.g. control versus treatment), the method of RNA isolation had little effect on the ability to identify differentially expressed transcripts. However, we suggest that researchers performing meta-analyses across different experimental batches strongly consider the RNA isolation methods for each experiment.",

    "abstract": "The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 in mammals evolved the capability of integrating pain arising from combinations of noxious temperature or chemical irritants. Four-fold repetition of TRPV1 subunits makes an ion channel endowed with excellent sensitivity for pain detection, assisting this ionotropic receptor to differentiate graded injuries. We manipulated the stoichiometry and relative steric coordination of capsaicin binding at the molecular level, explicating rules with which a receptor codes pain within a broad range of intensity. The first ligand binding delivers small but clear initiation of channel activation. Maximal agonist action has already been reached in a receptor-in-tandem containing two or three wild-type receptor units, displaying activity comparable to the full liganded all-wild-type tandem tetramers. When the binding sites outnumbered ligands, independent action dominates in each channel. The non-vanilloid agonist 2-APB differs from capsaicin by adopting a distinct open mechanism since it does not demand a vanilloid group to activate. The sharing of the same pore greatly simplifies synergism to transduce relevant inputs by summation for pain signaling. And questions the need to explore deeper into other aspects of nociception.",

    "abstract": "Fasting protects stem cells and increases stem cell functionality through mechanisms which are not fully understood. Planarians are not only able to regenerate their bodies, but also to stand long periods of starvation by shrinking in size. This adaptation is possible because of a large population of adult stem cells which indefinitely self-renew even under starved conditions and thus confer planarians with immortality. How starved planarians are able to maintain healthy stem cells and to fuel stem cell proliferation allowing regeneration is unknown. Here we found the TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) to be upregulated in starved stem cells. Down-regulation of TRiC impairs planarian regenerative response by inducing stem cell genome instability, mitotic defects and stem cell death which translates into stem cell exhaustion. This regulation is specific of starvation since feeding planarians prevents the phenotype. Importantly we found that TRiC activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) which allows a convergent regulation of cellular energy and lipid metabolism in starved planarians thus permitting the high energy demanding regenerative mitotic response. We identified a novel mechanism through which starvation protects the somatic stem cell genome allowing for unlimited stem cell proliferation and regeneration.",

SSA has been studied mainly with sounds that bear no behavioral meaning. We hypothesized that the acquisition of behavioral meaning by a sound should modify the amount of SSA evoked by that sound. To test this hypothesis, we used fear conditioning in rats, using two word-like stimuli, derived from the English words \\\"danger\\\" and \\\"safety\\\", as well as pure tones. One stimulus (CS+) was associated with a foot shock whereas the other stimulus (CS-) was presented without a concomitant foot shock. We recorded neural responses to the auditory stimuli using chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, recording responses telemetrically in freely moving animals before and after conditioning. Consistent with our hypothesis, SSA changed in a way that depended on the behavioral role of the sound: the contrast between standard and deviant responses remained the same or decreased for CS+ stimuli but increased for CS- stimuli, showing that SSA is shaped by experience. In most cases the sensory responses underlying these changes in SSA increased following conditioning. Unexpectedly, the responses to CS+ word-like stimuli showed a specific, substantial decrease, which we interpret as evidence for substantial inhibitory plasticity.",

Although the former property has been studied extensively, the roles of the NSC remain unexplored. The genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) provides a unique window into ACVR1/Activin A signaling because in that disease Activin can either signal through FOP-mutant ACVR1 or form NSCs with wild type ACVR1. To explore the role of the NSC, we generated  agonist-only Activin A muteins that activate ACVR1B but cannot form the NSC with ACVR1. Using one of these muteins we demonstrate that failure to form the NSC in FOP results in more severe disease pathology. These results provide the first evidence for a biological role for the NSC in vivo and pave the way for further exploration of the NSCs physiological role in corresponding knock-in mice.\n\nImpact StatementThe non-signaling complex formed by Activin A and ACVR1 is operant in vivo and is required to temper the degree of heterotopic ossification in the genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.",

How this transition is coordinated in humans is largely unknown. We show that the double homeodomain transcription factor DUX4 contributes to this transition. DUX4 knockdown in human zygotes caused insufficient transcriptome reprogramming as observed three days after fertilization. Induced DUX4 expression in human embryonic stem cells activated transcription of thousands of newly identified bi-directional transcripts, including putative enhancers for embryonic genome activation genes such as LEUTX. DUX4 protein interacted with transcriptional modifiers that are known to couple enhancers and promoters. Taken together, our results reveal that DUX4 is a pioneer regulating oocyte-to-embryo transition in human through activation of intergenic genome, especially enhancers, and hence setting the stage for early human embryo development.",

Indeed, past and current conditions influencing effective population size have important evolutionary implications for the efficacy of selection, increased accumulation of deleterious mutations, and loss of adaptive potential. Here, we gather extensive genome-wide data that represent the extant diversity of the Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to address two objectives. We demonstrate that a single glacial refugium is the source of most of the present-day genetic diversity, with detectable inputs from a putative secondary micro-refugium. We found statistical support for a scenario whereby ancestral populations located south of the ice sheets expanded in postglacial time, swamping out most of the diversity from other putative micro-refugia. Demographic inferences revealed that genetic diversity was also affected by linked selection in large parts of the genome. Moreover, we demonstrate that the recent demographic history of this species generated regional differences in the load of deleterious mutations among populations, a finding that mirrors recent results from human populations and provides increased support for models of expansion load. We propose that insights from these historical inferences should be better integrated in conservation planning of wild organisms, which currently focuses largely on neutral genetic diversity and local adaptation, with the role of potentially maladaptive variation being generally ignored.",

The Californian tree, coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.) is one of such species due to its excellent wood properties and high growth rate. It is sensitive to the freezing temperatures, but several trees of unknown origin introduced to Germany decades ago demonstrated high frost tolerance, and their propagated cuttings were planted all over German botanic gardens and arboreta. The knowledge of their origin within the natural distribution range could help us identify the potential genetic resources of frost resistant coast redwood genotypes. Therefore, both trees of unknown origin in Germany (G) and two reference data sets representing the \\\"Kuser provenance test\\\" established in 1990 in France (F) and samples collected in California (C) with known origin were genotyped using 18 microsatellite markers including 12 nuclear and six chloroplast simple sequence repeat (cpSSR) markers. The number of haplotypes found in the data sets based on six cpSSR markers was surprisingly very high. These markers were used to assign the German frost resistant trees (G) to the two reference data sets (F and C). The genetic structure among California samples (C) based on nSSR and cpSSR markers was very weak and mainly due to northern and southern clusters separated by the San Francisco Bay as a geographic barrier between coast redwood populations confirming previously published data. It was impossible to confidently assign frost tolerant trees (G) to single native populations, but rather to either the northern or southern cluster. However, the existing frost tolerant genotypes can already be used to establish commercial coast redwood plantation for future German forestry.",

Attempt also been made to assess the capability of the environmental parameters for explaining the variation in microbial community composition.\\n\\nResultsOur investigation indicates the dominancy of halophilic marine bacteria from families Flavobacteriaceae and OM1 clade in the water with lower nutrient load collected from costal regions of a small Island of Sundarban Mangroves (ISM). At higher eutrophic conditions, changes in bacterial communities in Open Marine Water (OMW) were detected, where some of the marine hydrocarbons degrading bacteria under families Oceanospirillaceae and Spongiibacteraceae were dominated. While most abundant bacterial family Rhodobacteracea almost equally (18% of the total community) dominated in both sites. Minor variation in the composition of archaeal community was also observed between OMW and ISM.

Cadavers with steatotic (>5% fat) or fibrotic (>2% collagen) control samples were excluded.\\n\\nResultsSignificantly more collagen was present in the right parafissural liver parenchyma: median 0.68% (IQR: 0.32 - 1.17%), compared to the left side 0.48% (IQR: 0.21 - 0.75%) (p 0.008), with equal fat content and CT attenuation values. The etiophysiology goes back to the demise of the umbilical venes in the early embryonic and neonatal period.\\n\\nConclusionsThe right parafissural area contains more collagen and an equal amount of fat compared to the control left side. This supports the hypothesis of delayed,  third inflow: the postnatal change in blood supply from umbilical to portal leaves the downstream parafissural area hypoperfused leading to hypoxia which in turn results in collagen accumulation and the persistence of paraumbilical veins of Sappey.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LIThe typical location for a parafissural hepatic pseudolesion contains increased collagen.\\nC_LIO_LIA change in histology is caused by physiological demise of the umbilical venes.\\nC_LIO_LIThe suboptimal blood supply of the right parafissural side leads to hypoxia and collagen deposition.\\nC_LIO_LIEmbryologic knowledge and postmortem histology can help resolve issues in radiology.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cancer affects millions of individuals worldwide. One shortcoming of traditional cancer classification systems is that, even for tumors affecting a single organ, there is significant molecular heterogeneity. Precise molecular classification of tumors could be beneficial in personalizing patients therapy and predicting prognosis. To this end, here we propose to use molecular signatures to further refine cancer classification. Molecular signatures are collections of genes characterizing particular cell types, tissues or disease. Signatures can be used to interpret expression profiles from heterogeneous samples. Large collections of gene signatures have previously been cataloged in the MSigDB database. We have developed a web-based Signature Visualization Tool (SaVanT) to display signature scores in user-generated expression data. Here we have undertaken a systematic analysis of correlations between inflammatory signatures and cancer samples, to test whether inflammation can differentiate cancer types. Inflammatory response signatures were obtained from MsigDB and SaVanT and a signature score was computed for samples associated with 7 different cancer types. We first identified types of cancers that had high inflammation levels as measured by these signatures. The correlation between signature scores and metadata of these patients (gender, age at initial cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, and vital status) was then computed. We sought to evaluate correlations between inflammation with other clinical parameters and identified four cancer types that had statistically significant association (p-value < 0.05) with at least one clinical characteristic: pancreas adenocarcinoma (PAAD), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), kidney chromophobe (KICH), and uveal melanoma (UVM). These results may allow future studies to use these approaches to further refine cancer subtyping and ultimately treatment.",

    "abstract": "Retinal organoids generated from human pluripotent stem cells exhibit considerable variability in temporal dynamics of differentiation. To assess the maturity of neural retina in vitro, we performed transcriptome analyses of developing organoids from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell lines. We show that the developmental variability in organoids was reflected in gene expression profiles and could be evaluated by molecular staging with the human fetal and adult retinal transcriptome data. We also demonstrated that addition of 9-cis retinal, instead of widely-used all-trans retinoic acid, accelerated rod photoreceptor differentiation in organoid cultures, with higher rhodopsin expression and more mature mitochondrial morphology evident by day 120. Our studies thus provide an objective transcriptome-based modality for determining the differentiation state of retinal organoids, which should facilitate disease modeling and evaluation of therapies in vitro.\\n\\nSummary StatementThree-dimensional organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells have been extensively applied for investigating organogenesis, modeling diseases and development of therapies. However, substantial variations within organoids pose challenges for comparison among different cultures and studies. We generated transcriptomes of multiple distinct retinal organoids and compared these to human fetal and adult retina gene profiles for molecular staging of differentiation state of the cultures. Our analysis revealed the advantage of using 9-cis retinal, instead of the widely-used all-trans retinoic acid, in facilitating rod photoreceptor differentiation. Thus, a transcriptome-based comparison can provide an objective method to uncover the maturity of organoid cultures across different lines and in various study platforms.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years extensive studies have been put on the analysis of genome function, especially on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) which offered promise for characterization of the functional sequencing variation and for the understanding of the basic processes of gene regulation. However, most studies of eQTL mapping have not implemented models that allow for the non-equivalence of parental alleles as so-called parent-of-origin effects (POEs); thus, the number and effects of imprinted genes remain important open questions. Imprinting is a type of POE that the expression of certain genes depends on their allelic parent-of-origin which are important contributors to phenotypic variations, such as diabetes and many cancer types. Besides, multi-collinearity is an important issue arising from modeling multiple genetic effects. To address these challenges, we proposed a statistical framework to test the main allelic effects of the candidate eQTLs along with the POE with an orthogonal model for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Using simulations, we demonstrated the desirable power and Type I error of the orthogonal model which also achieved accurate estimation of the genetic effects and over-dispersion of the RNA-seq data. These methods were applied to an existing HapMap project trio dataset to validate the reported imprinted genes and to discovery novel imprinted genes. Using the orthogonal method, we validated existing imprinting genes and discovered two novel imprinting genes with significant dominance effect.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the past decades, an unprecedented wealth of knowledge has been accumulated for understanding variations in human DNA level. However, this DNA-level knowledge has not been sufficiently translated to understanding the mechanisms of human diseases. Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is one of the most promising approaches to fill this gap, which aims to explore the genetic basis of gene expression. Genomic imprinting is an important epigenetic phenomenon which is an important contributor to phenotypic variation in human complex diseases and may explain some of the \\\"hidden\\\" heritable variability. Many imprinting genes are known to play important roles in human complex diseases such as diabetes, breast cancer and obesity. However, traditional eQTL mapping approaches does not allow for the detection of imprinting which is usually involved in gene expression imbalance. In this study, we have for the first time demonstrated the orthogonal statistical model can be applied to eQTL mapping for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. We showed by simulated and real data that the orthogonal model outperformed the usual functional model for detecting main effects in most cases, which addressed the issue of confounding between the dominance and additive effects. Application of the statistical model to the HapMap data resulted in discovery of some potential eQTLs with imprinting effects and dominance effects on expression of RB1 and IGF1R genes.\\n\\nIn summary, we developed a comprehensive framework for modeling imprinting effect for eQTL mapping, by decomposing the effects to multiple genetic components. This study is providing new insights into statistical modeling of eQTL mapping with RNA-seq data which allows for uncorrelated parameter estimation of genetic effects, covariates and over-dispersion parameter.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction causes muscle wasting (or atrophy) in many diseases and probably also during aging. The underlying mechanism is unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests that substantial levels of bioenergetic deficiency and oxidative stress are insufficient by themselves to intrinsically cause muscle wasting, raising the possibility that non-bioenergetic factors may contribute to mitochondria-induced muscle wasting. In this report, we show that chronic adaptation to mitochondria-induced proteostatic stress in the cytosol induces muscle wasting. We generated transgenic mice with unbalanced mitochondrial protein loading and import, by a two-fold increase in the expression of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial carrier protein, Ant1. We found that the ANT1-transgenic mice progressively lose muscle mass. Skeletal muscle is severely atrophic in older mice without affecting the overall lifespan. Mechanistically, Ant1 overloading induces aggresome-like structures and the expression of small heat shock proteins in the cytosol. The data support mitochondrial Precursor Overaccumulation Stress (mPOS), a recently discovered cellular stress mechanism caused by the toxic accumulation of unimported mitochondrial precursors/preproteins. Importantly, the ANT1-transgenic muscles have a drastically remodeled transcriptome that appears to be trying to counteract mPOS, by repressing protein synthesis, and by stimulating proteasomal function, autophagy and lysosomal amplification. These anti-mPOS responses collectively reduce protein content, which is known to decrease myofiber size and muscle mass. Our work therefore revealed that a subtle imbalance between mitochondrial protein load and import is sufficient to induce mPOS in vivo, and that anti-mPOS adaptation is a robust mechanism of muscle wasting. This finding may help improve the understanding of how mitochondria contribute to muscle wasting. It could have direct implications for several human diseases associated with ANT1 overexpression, including Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy (FSHD).\n\nOne Sentence SummaryProteostatic adaptations to proteostatic stress in the cytosol caused by unbalanced mitochondrial protein loading and import lead to progressive muscle wasting.",

    "abstract": "The Scar/WAVE complex is the principal catalyst of pseudopod and lamellipod formation. Here we show that Scar/WAVEs proline-rich domain is polyphosphorylated after the complex is activated. Treatments that stop activation block phosphorylation in both Dictyostelium and mammalian cells. This implies that phosphorylation modulates pseudopods after they have been formed, rather than controlling whether a protrusion is initiated. Unexpectedly, activation-dependent phosphorylation is not promoted by chemotactic signalling, or by signal-dependent kinases such as ERKs, but is greatly stimulated by cell:substrate adhesion. Scar/WAVE that has been mutated to be either unphosphorylatable or phosphomimetic is activated normally, and rescues the phenotype of scar- cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation is dispensible for activation and actin regulation. However, pseudopods and patches of Scar/WAVE complex recruitment last substantially longer in unphosphorylatable mutants, altering cell polarisation and the efficiency of migration. We conclude that pseudopod engagement with substratum is more important than extracellular signals at regulating Scar/WAVEs activity, and that phosphorylation acts as a timer, restricting pseudopod lifetime by promoting Scar/WAVE turnover.",

    "abstract": "Managing and mitigating agricultural pest resistance to control technologies is a complex system in which biological and social factors spatially and dynamically interact. We build a spatially explicit population genetics model for the evolution of pest resistance to Bt toxins by the insect Ostrinia nubilalis and an agent-based model of Bt maize adoption, emphasizing the importance of social factors. The farmer adoption model for Bt maize weighed both individual profitability and adoption decisions of neighboring farmers to mimic the effects of economic incentives and social networks. The model was calibrated using aggregate adoption data for Wisconsin. Simulation experiments with the model provide insights into mitigation policies for a high-dose Bt maize technology once resistance emerges in a pest population. Mitigation policies evaluated include increased refuge requirements for all farms, localized bans on Bt maize where resistance develops, areawide applications of insecticidal sprays on resistant populations, and taxes on Bt maize seed for all farms. Evaluation metrics include resistance allele frequency, pest population density, farmer adoption of Bt maize and economic surplus generated by Bt maize.\\n\\nBased on economic surplus, the results suggest that refuge requirements should remain the foundation of resistance management and mitigation for high-dose Bt maize technologies. For shorter planning horizons (< 16 years), resistance mitigation strategies did not improve economic surplus from Bt maize. Social networks accelerated the emergence of resistance, making the optimal policy intervention for longer planning horizons rely more on increased refuge requirements and less on insecticidal sprays targeting resistant pest populations. Overall, the importance social factors play in these results implies more social science research, including agent-based models, would contribute to developing better policies to address the evolution of pest resistance.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBt maize has been a valuable technology used by farmers for more than two decades to control pest damage to crops. Using Bt maize, however, leads to pest populations evolving resistance to Bt toxins so that benefits decrease. As a result, managing and mitigating resistance has been a serious concern for policymakers balancing the current and future benefits for many stakeholders. While the evolution of insect resistance is a biological phenomenon, human activities also play key roles in agricultural landscapes with active pest management, yet social science research on resistance management and mitigation policies has generally lagged biological research. Hence, to evaluate policy options for resistance mitigation for this complex biological and social system, we build an agent-based model that integrates key social factors into insect ecology in a spatially and dynamically explicit way. We demonstrate the significance of social factors, particularly social networks. Based on an economic surplus criterion, our results suggest that refuge requirements should remain the foundation of resistance mitigation policies for high-dose Bt technologies, rather than localized bans, areawide insecticide sprays, or taxes on Bt maize seed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDNA replication occurs on mammalian chromosomes in a cell-type distinctive temporal order known as the replication timing program. We previously found that disruption of the noncanonical lncRNA genes ASAR6 and ASAR15 results in delayed replication timing and delayed mitotic chromosome condensation of human chromosome 6 and 15, respectively. ASAR6 and ASAR15 display random monoallelic expression, and display asynchronous replication between alleles that is coordinated with other random monoallelic genes on their respective chromosomes. Disruption of the expressed allele, but not the silent allele, of ASAR6 leads to delayed replication, activation of the previously silent alleles of linked monoallelic genes, and structural instability of human chromosome 6. In this report, we describe a second lncRNA gene (ASAR6-141) on human chromosome 6 that when disrupted results in delayed replication timing in cis. ASAR6-141 is subject to random monoallelic expression and asynchronous replication, and is expressed from the opposite chromosome 6 homolog as ASAR6. ASAR6-141 RNA, like ASAR6 and ASAR15 RNAs, contains a high L1 content and remains associated with the chromosome territory where it is transcribed. Three classes of cis-acting elements control proper chromosome function in mammals: origins of replication, centromeres; and telomeres, which are responsible for replication, segregation and stability of all chromosomes. Our work supports a fourth type of essential chromosomal element, \\\"Inactivation/Stability Centers\\\", which express ASAR lncRNAs responsible for proper replication timing, monoallelic expression, and structural stability of each chromosome.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMammalian cells replicate their chromosomes during a highly ordered and cell type-specific program. Genetic studies have identified two long non-coding RNA genes, ASAR6 and ASAR15, as critical regulators of the replication timing program of human chromosomes 6 and 15, respectively. There are several unusual characteristics of the ASAR6 and ASAR15 RNAs that distinguish them from other long non-coding RNAs, including: being very long (>200 kb), lacking splicing of the transcripts, lacking polyadenylation, and being retained in the nucleus on the chromosomes where they are made. ASAR6 and ASAR15 also have the unusual property of being expressed from only one copy of the two genes located on homologous chromosome pairs. Using these unusual characteristics shared between ASAR6 and ASAR15, we have identified a second ASAR lncRNA gene located on human chromosome 6, which we have named ASAR6-141. ASAR6-141 is expressed from the opposite chromosome 6 homolog as ASAR6, and disruption of the expressed allele results in delayed replication of chromosome 6. ASAR6-141 RNA had previously been annotated as vlinc273. The very long intergenic non-coding (vlinc)RNAs represent a recently annotated class of RNAs that are long (>50 kb), non-spliced, and non-polyadenlyated nuclear RNAs. There are currently >2,700 vlincRNAs expressed from every chromosome, are encoded by >15% of the human genome, and with a few exceptions have no known function. Our results suggest the intriguing possibility that the vlinc class of RNAs may be functioning to control the replication timing program of all human chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteria use population density to control gene expression via quorum sensing. In Vibrio cholerae, quorum sensing coordinates virulence, biofilm formation, and DNA uptake by natural competence. The transcription factors AphA and HapR, expressed at low- and high-cell density respectively, play a key role. In particular, AphA triggers the entire virulence cascade upon host colonisation. In this work we have mapped genome-wide DNA binding by AphA. We show that AphA is versatile, exhibiting distinct modes of DNA binding and promoter regulation. Unexpectedly, whilst HapR is known to induce natural competence, we demonstrate that AphA also intervenes. Most notably, AphA is a direct repressor of tfoX, the master activator of competence. Hence, production of AphA markedly suppressed DNA uptake; an effect largely circumvented by ectopic expression of tfoX. Our observations suggest dual regulation of competence. At low cell density AphA is a master repressor whilst HapR activates the process at high cell density. Thus, we provide deep mechanistic insight into the role of AphA and highlight how V. cholerae utilises this regulator for diverse purposes.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCholera remains a devastating diarrhoeal disease responsible for millions of cases, thousands of deaths, and a $3 billion financial burden every year. Although notorious for causing human disease, the microorganism responsible for cholera is predominantly a resident of aquatic environments. Here, the organism survives in densely packed communities on the surfaces of crustaceans. Remarkably, in this situation, the microbe can feast on neighbouring cells and acquire their DNA. This provides a useful food source and an opportunity to obtain new genetic information. In this paper, we have investigated how acquisition of DNA from the local environment is regulated. We show that a \\\"switch\\\" within the microbial cell, known to activate disease processes in the human host, also controls DNA uptake. Our results explain why DNA scavenging only occurs in suitable environments and illustrates how interactions between common regulatory switches affords precise control of microbial behaviours.",
