    "abstract": "Protein dynamic network analysis provides a powerful tool for investigating protein allosteric regulation. We recently developed a current-flow betweenness scheme for protein network analysis and demonstrated that this method, i.e. using current-flow betweenness as edge weights, is more appropriate and more robust for investigating the signal transmission between two predefined protein residues or domains as compared with direct usage of correlation scores as edge weights. Here we seek to expand the current-flow scheme to study allosteric regulations involving protein-protein binding. Specifically, we investigated three gain-of-function mutations located at the binding interface of ALK2 (also known as ACVR1) kinase and its inhibitory protein FKBP12. We first searched for the optimal smoothing function for contact network construction and then calculated the subnetwork between FKBP12 protein and ALK2 ATP binding site using current-flow betweenness. By comparing the networks between the wild-type and three mutants, we have identified statistically significant changes in the protein-protein networks that are common among all three mutants that allosterically shift the kinase towards a catalytically competent configuration.",

    "abstract": "One view is that conceptual knowledge is organized using the circuitry in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that supports spatial processing and navigation. In contrast, we find that a domain-general learning algorithm explains key findings in both spatial and conceptual domains. When the clustering model is applied to spatial navigation tasks, so called place and grid cell-like representations emerge because of the relatively uniform distribution of possible inputs in these tasks. The same mechanism applied to conceptual tasks, where the overall space can be higher-dimensional and sampling sparser, leads to representations more aligned with human conceptual knowledge. Although the types of memory supported by the MTL are superficially dissimilar, the information processing steps appear shared. Our account suggests that the MTL uses a general-purpose algorithm to learn and organize context-relevant information in a useful format, rather than relying on navigation-specific neural circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in the balance between prior expectations and sensory evidence may account for faulty perceptions and inferences leading to psychosis. However, uncertainties remain about the nature of altered prior expectations and the degree to which they vary with the emergence of psychosis. We explored how expectations arising at two different levels - cognitive and perceptual - influenced processing of sensory information and whether relative influences of higher and lower level priors differed across people with prodromal symptoms and those with psychotic illness. In two complementary auditory perception experiments, 91 participants (30 with first episode psychosis, 29 at clinical risk for psychosis, and 32 controls) were required to decipher a phoneme within ambiguous auditory input. Expectations were generated in two ways: an accompanying visual input of lip movements observed during auditory presentation, or through written presentation of a phoneme provided prior to auditory presentation. We determined how these different types of information shaped auditory perceptual experience, how this was altered across the prodromal and established phases of psychosis, and how this relates to cingulate glutamate levels assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The psychosis group relied more on high level cognitive priors compared to both healthy controls and those at clinical risk for psychosis, and more on low level perceptual priors than the clinical risk group. The risk group were marginally less reliant on low level perceptual priors than controls. The results are consistent with previous theory that influences of prior expectations in psychosis in perception differ according to level of prior and illness phase.\\n\\nGeneral scientific summaryWhat we perceive and believe on any given moment will allow us to form expectations about what we will experience in the next. In psychosis, it is believed that the influence of these so-called perceptual and cognitive  prior expectations on perception is altered, thereby giving rise to the symptoms seen in psychosis. However, research thus far has found mixed evidence, some suggesting an increase in the influence of priors and some finding a decrease. Here we test the hypothesis that perceptual and cognitive priors are differentially affected in individuals at-risk for psychosis and individuals with a first episode of psychosis, thereby partially explaining the mixed findings in the literature. We indeed found evidence in favour of this hypothesis, finding weaker perceptual priors in individuals at-risk, but stronger cognitive priors in individuals with first episode psychosis.",

    "abstract": "FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2) is a plant immune receptor that binds bacterial flagellin to activate immune signaling. This immune signal is transduced by a heterotrimeric G protein complex at the plasma membrane and activates downstream signaling. However, it is unknown whether the heterotrimeric G proteins have functions at other subcellular locations away from the plasma membrane. Here, we show that components of the heterotrimeric G protein complex stabilize FLS2 protein levels by inhibiting the autophagic degradation of FLS2. Using genetic analysis, we determined that mutations of G protein components resulted in reduced immune signaling in part due to decreased FLS2 protein levels. Furthermore, reduction of FLS2 protein levels was caused by elevated proteasomal and autophagic degradation of FLS2. Genetic inhibition of autophagy in G protein mutants rescued FLS2 levels and immunity. Our findings suggest that the heterotrimeric G protein components, in addition to being part of the heterotrimeric G protein complex that transduces signals at the plasma membrane, also function away from the plasma membrane to control FLS2 protein levels. These results expand the functional capacity of the heterotrimeric G protein complexes in plant immunity.",

Specifically, PSM1 and PSM4 structure the S. aureus biofilm by assembling into robust cross-{beta} amyloid fibrils. PSM3, the most cytotoxic member of the family, assembles into cross- fibrils in which -helices stack into tightly mated sheets, mimicking the cross-{beta} architecture. Here we demonstrated that massive T-cell deformation and death is linked with PSM3 aggregation and co-localization with cell membranes. Our extensive mutagenesis analyses supported the role of positive charges, and especially Lys17, in interactions with the membrane, and suggested their regulation by inter- and intra-helical electrostatic interactions within the cross- fibril. We hypothesize that PSM3 cytotoxicity is governed by the ability to form cross- fibrils and involves a dynamic process of co-aggregation with cell membrane, rupturing it.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe cytotoxic S. aureus PSM3 assembles into cross- fibrils\nC_LIO_LICross- fibril polymorphism and mutations-induced secondary structure switching\nC_LIO_LIRegulation by cross- fibril inter- and intra-helical electrostatic interactions\nC_LIO_LIToxicity as a putative dynamic process of PSM3 co-aggregation with membranes\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) make up half of mammalian genomes and shape genome regulation by harboring binding sites for regulatory factors. These include architectural proteins--such as CTCF, RAD21 and SMC3--that are involved in tethering chromatin loops and marking domain boundaries. The 3D organization of the mammalian genome is intimately linked to its function and is remarkably conserved. However, the mechanisms by which these structural intricacies emerge and evolve have not been thoroughly probed. Here we show that TEs contribute extensively to both the formation of species-specific loops in humans and mice via deposition of novel anchoring motifs, as well as to the maintenance of conserved loops across both species via CTCF binding site turnover. The latter function demonstrates the ability of TEs to contribute to genome plasticity and reinforce conserved genome architecture as redundant loop anchors. Deleting such candidate TEs in human cells leads to a collapse of such conserved loop and domain structures. These TEs are also marked by reduced DNA methylation and bear mutational signatures of hypomethylation through evolutionary time. TEs have long been considered a source of genetic innovation; by examining their contribution to genome topology, we show that TEs can contribute to regulatory plasticity by inducing redundancy and potentiating genetic drift locally while conserving genome architecture globally, revealing a paradigm for defining regulatory conservation in the noncoding genome beyond classic sequence-level conservation.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryCo-option of transposable elements maintains conserved 3D genome structures via CTCF binding site turnover in human and mouse.",

Simulations of these models are computationally expensive, considerably curtailing their utility. Neuron_Reduce is a new analytical approach to reduce the morphological complexity and computational time of nonlinear neuron models. Synapses and active membrane channels are mapped to the reduced model preserving their transfer impedance to the soma; synapses with identical transfer impedance are merged into one NEURON process still retaining their individual activation times. Neuron_Reduce accelerates the simulations by 40-250 folds for a variety of cell types and realistic number (10,000-100,000) of synapses while closely replicating voltage dynamics and specific dendritic computations. The reduced neuron-models will enable realistic simulations of neural networks at unprecedented scale, including networks emerging from micro-connectomics efforts and biologically-inspired \\\"deep networks\\\".

First, we show that noise correlations decrease as cognitive engagement and task demands increase, both across tasks and within-trials. Second, we demonstrate, for the first time, rhythmic modulations of noise correlations in the alpha and beta frequency ranges that account both for overt behavioral performance and for layer specific modulations in spike-field coherence.

    "abstract": "Imputation is one of the key steps in the preprocessing and quality control protocol of any genetic study. Most imputation algorithms were originally developed for the use in human genetics and thus are optimized for a high level of genetic diversity. Different versions of BEAGLE were evaluated on genetic datasets of doubled haploids of two European maize landraces, a commercial breeding line and a diversity panel in chicken, respectively, with different levels of genetic diversity and structure which can be taken into account in BEAGLE by parameter tuning. Especially for phasing BEAGLE 5.0 outperformed the newest version (5.1) which in turn also lead to improved imputation. Earlier versions were far more dependent on the adaption of parameters in all our tests. For all versions, the parameter ne (effective population size) had a major effect on the error rate for imputation of ungenotyped markers, reducing error rates by up to 98.5%. Further improvement was obtained by tuning of the parameters affecting the structure of the haplotype cluster that is used to initialize the underlying Hidden Markov Model of BEAGLE. The number of markers with extremely high error rates for the maize datasets were more than halved by the use of a flint reference genome (F7, PE0075 etc.) instead of the commonly used B73. On average, error rates for imputation of ungenotyped markers were reduced by 8.5% by excluding genetically distant individuals from the reference panel for the chicken diversity panel. To optimize imputation accuracy one has to find a balance between representing as much of the genetic diversity as possible while avoiding the introduction of noise by including genetically distant individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBud dormancy is a crucial stage in perennial trees and allows survival over winter to ensure optimal flowering and fruit production. Recent work highlighted physiological and molecular events occurring during bud dormancy in trees. However, they usually examined bud development or bud dormancy in isolation. In this work, we aimed to further explore the global transcriptional changes happening throughout bud development and dormancy onset, progression and release.\\n\\nResultsUsing next-generation sequencing and modelling, we conducted an in-depth transcriptomic analysis for all stages of flower buds in several sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) cultivars that are characterized for their contrasted dates of dormancy release. We find that buds in organogenesis, paradormancy, endodormancy and ecodormancy stages are defined by the expression of genes involved in specific pathways, and these are conserved between different sweet cherry cultivars. In particular, we found that DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM), floral identity and organogenesis genes are up-regulated during the pre-dormancy stages while endodormancy is characterized by a complex array of signalling pathways, including cold response genes, ABA and oxidation-reduction processes. After dormancy release, genes associated with global cell activity, division and differentiation are activated during ecodormancy and growth resumption. We then went a step beyond the global transcriptomic analysis and we developed a model based on the transcriptional profiles of just seven genes to accurately predict the main bud dormancy stages.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, this study has allowed us to better understand the transcriptional changes occurring throughout the different phases of flower bud development, from bud formation in the summer to flowering in the following spring. Our work sets the stage for the development of fast and cost effective diagnostic tools to molecularly define the dormancy stages. Such integrative approaches will therefore be extremely useful for a better comprehension of complex phenological processes in many species.",

    "abstract": "Cells in microbial colonies integrate information across multiple spatial and temporal scales while sensing environmental cues. A number of photosynthetic cyanobacteria respond in a directional manner to incident light, resulting in the phototaxis of individual cells. Colonies of such bacteria exhibit large-scale changes in morphology, arising from cell-cell interactions, during phototaxis. These interactions occur through type IV pili-mediated physical contacts between cells, as well as through the secretion of complex polysaccharides ( slime) that facilitates cell motion. Here, we describe a computational model for such collective behaviour in colonies of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. The model is designed to replicate observations from recent experiments on the emergent response of the colonies to varied light regimes. It predicts the complex colony morphologies that arise as a result. We ask if changes in colony morphology during phototaxis can be used to infer if cells integrate information from multiple light sources simultaneously, or respond to these light sources separately at each instant of time. We find that these two scenarios cannot be distinguished from the shapes of colonies alone. However, we show that tracking the trajectories of individual cyanobacteria provides a way of determining their mode of response. Our model allows us to address the emergent nature of this class of collective bacterial motion, linking individual cell response to the dynamics of colony shape.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceMicrobial colonies in the wild often consist of large groups of heterogeneous cells that coordi-nate and integrate information across multiple spatio-temporal scales. We describe a computational model for one such collective behaviour, phototaxis, in colonies of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis that move in response to light. The model replicates experimental observations the response of cyanobacterial colonies to varied light regimes, and predicts the complex colony morphologies that arise as a result.

    "abstract": "Previous evidence suggests different cortical areas naturally oscillate at distinct frequencies, reflecting tuning properties of each region. The concurrent use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to perturb cortical regions, resulting in an observed post-stimulation response that is maximal at the natural frequency of that region. However, little is known about the spatial extent of TMS-induced activation differences in cortical regions when comparing resting state (passive) versus active task performance. Here, we employed TMS-EEG to directly perturb three cortical areas in the right hemisphere while measuring the resultant changes in maximal evoked frequency in healthy human subjects during a resting state (N=12) and during an active sensorimotor task (N=12). Our results revealed that the brain engages a higher dominant frequency mode when actively engaged in a task, such that the frequency evoked during a task is consistently higher across cortical regions, regardless of the region stimulated. These findings suggest that a distinct characteristic of active performance versus resting state is a higher state of natural cortical frequencies.",

However, the precise mechanism through which the prefrontal cortex, at the source of attention control signals, organizes this rhythmic exploration of space remains unknown. We show that, when decoded at a high spatial (0.1{degrees}) and temporal resolution (50ms), the prefrontal covert attentional spotlight, aka the minds eye, continuously explores space at an alpha 7-12 Hz rhythm. When sensory events are presented at a specific optimal phase (resp. anti-phase) with respect to this rhythm, sensory encoding and behavioral report are accurate (resp. poor). We propose that this rhythmic prefrontal attentional spotlight dynamics corresponds to a continuous overt exploration of space via alpha-clocked attentional saccades. These attentional saccades are highly flexible, their pattern of space exploration depending both on within-trial and across-task contingencies. These results are discussed in the context of exploration and exploitation strategies and prefrontal top-down attentional control.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe decoded prefrontal attentional spotlight samples visual space in rhythmic cycles\\nC_LIO_LIThis rhythmic attentional exploration predicts neuronal sensory processing accuracy\\nC_LIO_LIThis rhythmic attentional exploration predicts overt behavioral accuracy\\nC_LIO_LIThese rhythmic cycles define alpha-clocked attentional saccades\\nC_LIO_LISpace exploration by attentional saccades is highly flexible and under top-down control\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Studying relationships among gene-products by gene expression profile analysis is a common approach in systems biology. Many studies have generalized the outcomes to the different levels of central dogma information flow and assumed correlation of transcript and protein expression levels. All these efforts partook in the current understanding of signaling network models and expanded the signaling databases. In fact, due to the unavailability or high-cost of the experiments, most of the studies do not usually look for direct interactions, and some parts of these networks are contradictory. Besides, it is now a standard step to accomplish enrichment analysis on biological annotations, to make claims about the potentially implicated biological pathways in any perturbation. Explicitly, upon identifying differentially expressed genes, they are spontaneously presumed the corresponding dysregulated pathways. Then, molecular mechanistic insights are proposed for disease etiology and drug discovery based on statistically enriched biological processes. In this study, using four common and comprehensive databases, we extracted all relevant gene expression data and all relationships among directly linked gene pairs. We aimed to evaluate the ratio of coherency or sign consistency between the expression level and the causal relationships among the gene pairs. We illustrated that the signaling network was not more consistent or coherent with the recorded expression profile compared to the random relationships. Finally, we provided the pieces of evidence and concluded that gene-product expression data, especially at the transcript level, are not reliable or at least insufficient to infer causal biological relationships among genes and in turn, describe cellular behavior.",

Endogenous foamy viruses (EndFVs) are rare, and to date have only been described in a limited number of mammals, amphibians, reptiles and fish genomes. By screening 414 avian genomes we identified EndFVs in two bird species: the Maguari Stork (Ciconia maguari) and the Oriental Stork (C. boyciana). Analyses of phylogenetic relationships, genome structures and flanking sequences revealed a single origin of EndFVs in Ciconia species. In addition, the marked incongruence between the virus and host phylogenies suggested that this integration event occurred independently in birds. In sum, by providing evidence that birds can be infected with foamy viruses, we fill the last major gap in the taxonomic distribution of foamy viruses and their animal hosts.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. Hallmark psychotic symptoms can be considered as existing on a continuum from non-clinical to clinical populations. Assessing genetic risk and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in non-clinical populations and their associated neurobiological underpinnings can offer valuable insights into symptom-associated brain mechanisms without the potential confounds of the effects of schizophrenia and its treatment. We leveraged a large population-based cohort (UKBiobank) including information on PLEs, polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia (PRSSZ) and multi-modal brain imaging in combination with network neuroscience. Morphometric (cortical thickness, volume) and water diffusion (fractional anisotropy) properties of the regions and pathways belonging to the salience, default-mode and central-executive networks were computed. We hypothesized that these anatomical concomitants of functional dysconnectivity would be negatively associated with PRSSZ and PLEs. PRSSZ was significantly associated with a latent measure of cortical thickness across the salience network (r = -0.069, p = 0.010) and PLEs showed a number of significant associations with properties of the salience and default mode networks (involving the insular cortex, supramarginal gyrus and pars orbitalis, pFDR < 0.050); with the cortical thickness of the insula largely mediating the relationship between PRSSZ and auditory hallucinations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher genetic liability for schizophrenia is related to subtle disruptions in brain structure and predisposes to PLEs even among healthy participants. In addition, our study suggests that networks engaged during auditory hallucinations show structural associations with PLEs in the general population.",

    "abstract": "The ventral visual stream is known to be organized hierarchically, where early visual areas processing simplistic features feed into higher visual areas processing more complex features. Hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were largely inspired by this type of brain organization and have been successfully used to model neural responses in different areas of the visual system. In this work, we aim to understand how an instance of these models corresponds to temporal dynamics of human object processing. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and various similarity metrics, we compare the model representations with two electroencephalography (EEG) data sets containing responses to a shared set of 72 images. We find that there is a hierarchical relationship between the depth of a layer and the time at which peak correlation with the brain response occurs for certain similarity metrics in both data sets. However, when comparing across layers in the neural network, the correlation onset time did not appear in a strictly hierarchical fashion. We present two additional methods that improve upon the achieved correlations by optimally weighting features from the CNN and show that depending on the similarity metric, deeper layers of the CNN provide a better correspondence than shallow layers to later time points in the EEG responses. However, we do not find that shallow layers provide better correspondences than those of deeper layers to early time points, an observation that violates the hierarchy and is in agreement with the finding from the onset-time analysis. This work makes a first comparison of various response features--including multiple similarity metrics and data sets--with respect to a neural network.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary acini represent the functional gas-exchanging units of the lung. Due to technical limitations, individual acini cannot be identified on microscopic lung sections. To overcome these limitations, we imaged the right lower lobes of instillation-fixed rat lungs from postnatal days P4, P10, P21, and P60 at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source synchrotron facility at a voxel size of 1.48 m. Individual acini were segmented from the three-dimensional data by closing the airways at the transition from conducting to gas exchanging airways. For a subset of acini (N=268), we followed the acinar development by stereologically assessing their volume and their number of alveoli. We found that the mean volume of the acini increases 23 times during the observed time-frame. The coeffcients of variation dropped from 1.26 to 0.49 and the difference between the mean volumes of the fraction of the 20 % smallest to the 20 % largest acini decreased from a factor of 27.26 (day 4) to a factor of 4.07 (day 60), i.e. shows a smaller dispersion at later time points. The acinar volumes show a very large variation early in lung development and homogenize during maturation of the lung by reducing their size distribution by a factor of 7 until adulthood. The homogenization of the acinar sizes hints at an optimization of the gas-exchange region in the lungs of adult animals and that acini of different size are not evenly distributed in the lungs. This likely leads to more homogeneous ventilation at later stages in lung development.",

Here, we show that merely retrieving values from memory and making a choice between options is sufficient both to induce changes to stimulus-reward associations in the hippocampus and to bias future decision making. After allowing participants to make repeated choices between reward-conditioned stimuli, in the absence of any outcome, we observed that participants preferred stimuli they had previously chosen, and neglected previously unchosen stimuli, over otherwise identical-valued options. Using functional brain imaging, we show that decisions induced changes to hippocampal representations of stimulus-outcome associations. These changes were correlated with future decision biases. Our results indicate that choice-induced preference changes are partially driven by choice-induced modification of memory representations and suggest that merely making a choice - even without experiencing any outcomes - induces associative plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The ability to handle approximate quantities, or number sense, has been recurrently linked to mathematical skills, though the nature of the mechanism allowing to extract numerical information (i.e., numerosity) from environmental stimuli is still debated. A set of objects is indeed not only characterized by its numerosity but also by other features, such as the summed area occupied by the elements, which often covary with numerosity. These intrinsic relations between numerosity and non-numerical magnitudes led some authors to argue that numerosity is not independently processed but extracted through a weighting of continuous magnitudes. This view cannot be properly tested through classic behavioral and neuroimaging approaches due to these intrinsic correlations. The current study used a frequency-tagging EEG approach to separately measure responses to numerosity as well as to continuous magnitudes. We recorded occipital responses to numerosity, total area, and convex hull changes but not to density and dot size. We additionally applied a model predicting primary visual cortex responses to the set of stimuli. The model output was closely aligned with our electrophysiological data, since it predicted discrimination only for numerosity, total area, and convex hull. Our findings thus demonstrate that numerosity can be independently processed at an early stage in the visual cortex, even when completely isolated from other magnitude changes. The similar implicit discrimination for numerosity as for some continuous magnitudes, which correspond to basic visual percepts, shows that both can be extracted independently, hence substantiating the nature of numerosity as a primary feature of the visual scene.",

While these experiments can produce rich data, the computational analysis of these datasets is challenging. Single-cell analysis requires that cells be accurately identified in each image and subsequently tracked over time. Increasingly, deep learning is being used to interpret microscopy image with single cell resolution. In this work, we apply deep learning to the problem of tracking single cells in live-cell imaging data. Using crowdsourcing and a human-in-the-loop approach to data annotation, we constructed a dataset of over 11,000 cell nuclear trajectories that includes lineage information. Using this dataset, we successfully trained a deep learning model to perform cell tracking within a linear programming framework. Benchmarking tests demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of cell tracking with respect to multiple accuracy metrics. Further, we show that our deep learning-based method generalizes to perform cell tracking for both fluorescent and brightfield images of the cell cytoplasm, despite having never been trained those data types. This enables analysis of live-cell imaging data collected across imaging modalities. A persistent cloud deployment of our cell tracker is available at http://www.deepcell.org.",

The chordate larvae of colonial tunicates metamorphose to lose all chordate structures such as notochord, neural tube, segmented musculature, and then develop by asexual reproduction [blastogenesis], whereby stem cells form tissues and organs. These two developmental pathways establish the same body axis, morphogenetic patterning and organ formation. It is unknown if this convergent morphology implies convergent cellular and molecular mechanisms, and whether the stem cells that mediate these processes differ. Using the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri, we combined transcriptome sequencing and multiple microscopy techniques to study the molecular and morphological signatures of cells at each developmental stage of embryogenesis and blastogenesis. This revealed that the molecular programs are distinct, but the blastogenic tissue-specific stem cells and embryonic precursor populations share similar molecular profiles. By comparing embryogenesis in other chordates we found shared developmental principles, highlighting transcription factors as key evolutionary conserved elements.

    "abstract": "Stem cells are central to plant development. During root postembryonic development stem cells generating tissues are patterned in layers around a stem cell organizer or quiescent center (QC). How stem cell lineages are initially patterned is unclear. Here, we describe a role for BLUEJAY (BLJ), JACKDAW (JKD) and SCARECROW (SCR) transcription factors in patterning of cell lineages during growth and in patterning reestablishment during regeneration through regulation of number of QC cells and their regenerative capacities. In blj jkd scr mutants, QC cells are progressively lost which results in loss of tissue layers. Upon laser ablation blj jkd scr is impaired in QC division and specification resulting in severe impairment in pattern regeneration. Beyond direct regulation of QC activity by these transcription factors, reduced levels of SHORT-ROOT (SHR) and of PIN auxin transporters were observed in the vasculature of blj jkd scr, leading to strong reduction in the auxin response in the QC. We narrowed down non-cell-autonomous regulation of vascularly expressed genes in blj jkd scr to C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR 3 (CBF3). cbf3 mutant shows reduced levels of SHR in the vasculature, and in addition QC disorganization and downregulation of the QC regulator WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEODOMAIN 5 (WOX5). CBF3 gene is primarily expressed in the ground tissue downstream of BLJ, JKD and SCR, while CBF3 protein may move. Targeted-expression of CBF3 to the ground tissue of blj jkd scr recovers radial patterning and regeneration. We propose that BLJ, JKD and SCR regulate QC-mediated patterning, and that part of this regulation involves CBF3.",

    "abstract": "Epithelia have distinct cellular architectures, which are established in development, re-established after wounding, and maintained during tissue homeostasis despite cell turnover and mechanical perturbations. In turn, cell shape also controls tissue function as a regulator of cell differentiation, proliferation, and motility. Here we investigate cell shape changes in a model epithelial monolayer. After the onset of confluence, cells continue to proliferate and change shape over time, eventually leading to a final architecture characterized by arrested motion and more regular cell shapes. Such monolayer remodeling is robust, with qualitatively similar evolution in cell shape and dynamics observed across disparate perturbations. Here we quantify differences in monolayer remodeling guided by the active vertex model to identify underlying order parameters controlling epithelial architecture. When monolayers are formed atop extracellular matrix with varied stiffness, we find the cell density at which motion arrests varies significantly but the cell shape remains constant, consistent with the onset of tissue rigidity. In contrast, pharmacological perturbations can significantly alter the cell shape at which tissue dynamics is arrested, consistent with varied amounts of active stress within the tissue. Across all experimental conditions the final cell shape is well correlated to the cell proliferation rate, and cell cycle inhibition immediately arrests cell motility. Finally, we demonstrate cell-cycle variation in junctional tension as a source of active stress within the monolayer. Thus, the architecture and mechanics of epithelial tissue can arise from an interplay between cell mechanics and stresses arising from cell cycle dynamics.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe morphology of biological tissue is determined by the shape and density of constituent cells. Here we measure the dynamics of cells in model epithelial tissues to study the evolution of their shape and density over time. Guided by a mathematical model, we find that cell shape is controlled by rigidity and active stresses within the tissue. We then show that cell cycle dynamics are the source of active stress that drives epithelial remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Organoids are powerful models for studying tissue development, physiology, and disease. However, current culture systems disrupt the inductive tissue-tissue interactions needed for the complex morphogenetic processes of native organogenesis. Here we show that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be coaxed to robustly undergo the fundamental steps of early heart organogenesis with an in vivo-like spatiotemporal fidelity. These axially patterned embryonic organoids support the generation of cardiovascular progenitors, as well as first and second heart field compartments. The cardiac progenitors self-organize into an anterior domain reminiscent of a cardiac crescent before forming a beating cardiac tissue near a putative primitive gut-like tube, from which it is separated by an endocardial-like layer. These findings unveil the surprising morphogenetic potential of mESCs to execute key aspects of organogenesis through the coordinated development of multiple tissues. This platform could be an excellent tool for studying heart development in unprecedented detail and throughput.",

    "abstract": "An outstanding question in embryo development is how spatial patterns are formed robustly. In the zebrafish spinal cord, neural progenitors form stereotypic stripe-like patterns despite noisy morphogen signaling and large-scale cellular rearrangement required for tissue growth and morphogenesis. We set out to understand the mechanisms underlying this patterning robustness. Our adhesion assays revealed a preference for three neural progenitor types to stabilize contacts with cells of the same type. Genetic analysis uncovered a three-molecule adhesion code, composed of N-cadherin, Cadherin 11, and Protocadherin 19, with unique gene expression profiles for each cell type. Perturbation of the adhesion code results in loss of homotypic preference ex vivo and patterning errors in vivo. Both the cell fate and adhesion code are co-regulated by the common upstream morphogen signal Shh. We propose that robust patterning in tissues undergoing morphogenesis results from a previously unappreciated interplay between morphogen gradient-based patterning and adhesion-based self-organization.",

    "abstract": "Germ cell meiosis is one of the most finely orchestrated events during gametogenesis with distinct developmental patterns in males and females. However, in mammals, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain not well known. Here, we report detailed transcriptome analyses of cell populations present in the mouse female gonadal ridges (E11.5) and the embryonic ovaries from E12.5 to E14.5 using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq). These periods correspond with the initiation and progression of meiosis throughout the first stage of prophase I. We identified 13 transcriptionally distinct cell populations and 7 transcriptionally distinct germ cell subclusters that correspond to mitotic (3 clusters) and meiotic (4 clusters) germ cells. By comparing the signature gene expression pattern of 4 meiotic germ cell clusters, we found that the 4 cell clusters correspond to different cell status en route to meiosis progression, and therefore, our research here characterized detailed transcriptome dynamics during meiotic prophase I. Reconstructing the progression of meiosis along pseudotime, we identified several new genes and molecular pathways with potential critical roles in the mitosis/meiosis transition and early meiotic progression. Last, the heterogeneity within somatic cell populations was also discussed and different cellular states were identified. Our scRNA seq analysis here represents a new important resource for deciphering the molecular pathways driving meiosis initiation and progression in female germ cells and ovarian somatic cells.",

Here, we describe a novel mechano-sensitive component, namely barrier to autointegration factor, (BAF), which regulates DNA endocycling in Drosophila muscle fibers. We show that BAF negatively regulates DNA endoreplication by inhibiting of the nuclear entrance of E2F1 and Yap/Yorkie, two key components in cell cycle control. Furthermore, BAF localization at the nuclear membrane is mechanosensitive, as it was downregulated in LINC mutant larval muscles, or following nuclear deformation caused by disruption of nucleus-sarcomere connections. BAF forms a protein complex with E2F1, which is sensitive to BAF phosphorylation. Knockdown of BAF kinase VRK1/Ball disrupted localization of BAF at the nuclear membrane and resulted in increased E2F1 nuclear levels. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanosensitive pathway controlling BAF phosphorylation and localization at the nuclear membrane, which in turn, represses nuclear accumulation of positive cell cycle regulators.",

    "abstract": "Primordial follicle assembly in mammals occurs at perinatal ages and largely determines the ovarian reserve available to support the reproductive lifespan. The primordial follicle structure is generated by a complex network of interactions between oocytes and ovarian somatic cells that remain poorly understood. In the present research, using single-cell RNA sequencing performed over a time-series on mouse ovaries coupled with several bioinformatics analyses, the complete dynamic genetic programs of germ and granulosa cells from E16.5 to PD3 are reported for the first time. The time frame of analysis comprises the breakdown of germ cell cysts and the assembly of primordial follicles. Confirming the previously reported expression of genes by germ cells and granulosa cells, our analyses identified ten distinct gene clusters associated to germ cells and eight to granulosa cells. Consequently, several new genes expressed at significant levels at each investigated stage were assigned. Building single-cell pseudo temporal trajectories five states and two branch points of fate transition for the germ cells, and three states and one branch point for the granulosa cells were revealed. Moreover, GO and ClueGO term enrichment enabled identifying biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components more represented in germ cells and granulosa cells or common to both cell types at each specific stage. Finally, by SCENIC algorithm, we were able to establish a network of regulons that can be postulated as likely candidates for sustaining germ cell specific transcription programs throughout the investigated period.",

    "abstract": "Proliferating cells, typically considered \\\"non-excitable,\\\" nevertheless exhibit regulation by bioelectrical signals. Notably, voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) that are crucial for neuronal excitability, are also found in progenitors and upregulated in cancer. Here, we identify a role for VGSC in proliferation of Drosophila neuroblast (NB) lineages within the central nervous system. Loss of paralytic (para), the sole gene that encodes Drosophila VGSC, reduces neuroblast progeny cell number. The type II neuroblast lineages, featuring a transit-amplifying intermediate neural progenitors (INP) population similar to that found in the developing human cortex, are particularly sensitive to para manipulation. Following a series of asymmetric divisions, INPs normally exit the cell cycle through a final symmetric division. Our data suggests that loss of para induces apoptosis in this population, whereas overexpression leads to an increase in INPs and overall neuroblast progeny cell numbers. These effects are cell autonomous and depend on Para channel activity. Reduction of Para not only affects normal NB development, but also strongly suppresses brain tumor mass, implicating a role for Para in cancer progression. To our knowledge, our studies are the first to identify a role for VGSC in neural progenitor proliferation. Elucidating the contribution of VGSC in proliferation will advance our understanding of bioelectric signaling within development and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Directed cell migration in response to chemical and mechanical gradients plays a crucial role in physiological and pathological conditions. One such mechanical cues that is known to influences cell migration is the gradient of substrate elastic modulus (E). However, the elastic modulus alone cannot fully define the material properties of the cellular microenvironment, which often has both elastic and viscous characteristics. In this study, we investigated the influence of the gradient of viscous nature, as defined by loss modulus, G\\\", on cell migration. We cultured human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on a collagen-coated polyacrylamide gel with constant elastic property, as defined by the storage modulus G, but with the gradient of loss modulus G\\\". We found hMSCs to migrate from high to low loss modulus. We have termed this, thus far unreported, directional cellular migration as \\\"Viscotaxis\\\". We have confirmed uniform collagen density and constant storage modulus of the gel by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy to eliminate the possibilities of haptotaxis and durotaxis. We hypothesize that material creep in the high loss modulus region hinders the building up of the cellular traction, leading to a force asymmetry that drives the observed viscotaxis. To verify our hypothesis, we estimated the cellular traction on gels with high and low loss moduli. We indeed found that cells apply higher traction force on more elastic materials i.e. materials with low loss modulus. On the disruption of actomyosin contractility with myosin inhibitor blebbistatin and ROCK inhibitor Y27632, directional migration was lost. Further, we showed that cells can maintain a stable morphology on a low loss modulus substrate but due to its inability to build up stable cellular traction on a substrate with high loss modulus, the cell spreading remains in a dynamic state. Our findings in this paper highlight the importance of considering the viscous modulus while preparing stiffness-based substrates for the field of tissue engineering.",

ATP/ADP binding to Kir6.2 shuts KATP. Mg-nucleotide binding to SUR1 stimulates KATP. In the absence of Mg2+, SUR1 increases the apparent affinity for nucleotide inhibition at Kir6.2 by an unknown mechanism. We simultaneously measured channel currents and nucleotide binding to Kir6.2. Fits to combined data sets suggest that KATP closes with only one nucleotide molecule bound. A Kir6.2 mutation (C166S) that increases channel activity did not affect nucleotide binding, but greatly perturbed the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit KATP. Mutations at position K205 in SUR1 affected both nucleotide affinity and the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit KATP. This suggests a dual role for SUR1 in KATP inhibition, both in directly contributing to nucleotide binding and in stabilising the nucleotide-bound closed state.",

    "abstract": "Extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs during preimplantation embryo development and is accompanied by zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and first cell fate specification. Recent studies using single-cell epigenome sequencing techniques have provided global views of the dynamics of different epigenetic layers during this period. However, it remains largely unclear how the drastic epigenetic reprogramming contributes to transcriptional regulatory network. Here, we developed a single-cell multiomics sequencing technology (scNOMeRe-seq) that enables profiling of genome-wide chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression in the same individual cell with improved performance compared to that of earlier techniques. We applied this method to analyze the global dynamics of different molecular layers and their associations in mouse preimplantation embryos. We found that global DNA methylation remodeling facilitates the reconstruction of genetic lineages in early embryos and revealed that the gradual increases in heterogeneity among blastomeres are driven by asymmetric cleavage. Allele-specific DNA methylation pattern is maintained throughout preimplantation development and is accompanied by allele-specific associations between DNA methylation and gene expression in the gene body that are inherited from oocytes and sperm. Through integrated analyses of the collective dynamics between gene expression and chromatin accessibility, we constructed a ZGA-associated regulatory network and revealed coordination among multiple epigenetic layers, transcription factors (TFs) and repeat elements that instruct the proper ZGA process. Moreover, we found that inner cell mass (ICM)/trophectoderm (TE) lineage-associated cis-regulatory elements are stepwise activated in blastomeres during post-ZGA embryo stages. TE lineage-specific TFs play dual roles in promoting the TE program while repressing the ICM program, thereby separating the TE lineage from the ICM lineage. Taken together, our findings not only depict the first single-cell triple-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during mouse preimplantation development but also enhance the fundamental understanding of epigenetic regulation in early embryos.",

Here, we report how runx1 is specifically upregulated at the injury site during zebrafish heart regeneration, but unexpectedly, absence of runx1 results in enhanced regeneration. Using single cell sequencing, we found that the wild-type injury site consists of Runx1-positive endocardial cells and thrombocytes that induce expression of smooth muscle and collagen genes without differentiating into myofibroblasts. Both these populations are absent in runx1 mutants, resulting in a less collagenous and fibrinous scar. The reduction in fibrin in the mutant is further explained by reduced myofibroblast formation and by upregulation of components of the fibrin degradation pathway, including plasminogen receptor Annexin 2A as well as downregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor serpine1 in myocardium and endocardium, resulting in increased levels of Plasminogen. In addition, we find enhanced myocardial proliferation as well as increased myocardial survival in the mutant.

    "abstract": "An understanding of the structure-dynamics relationship is essential for understanding how a protein works. Prior research has shown that the activity of a protein correlates with intra-domain dynamics occurring at picosecond to millisecond timescales. However, the correlation between inter-domain dynamics and the function of a protein is poorly understood. Here we show that communications between the catalytic and hemopexin domains of matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP1) on type-1 collagen fibrils correlate with its activity. Using single-molecule FRET (smFRET), we identified functionally relevant open conformations where the two MMP1 domains are well-separated, which were significantly absent for catalytically inactive point mutant (E219Q) of MMP1 and could be modulated by an inhibitor or an enhancer of activity. The observed relevance of open conformations resolves the debate about the roles of open and closed MMP1 structures in function. A sum of two Gaussians fitted histograms, whereas an exponential fitted autocorrelations of smFRET values. We used a two-state Poisson process to describe the dynamics and used histograms and autocorrelations of conformations to calculate the kinetic rates between the two states. All-atom and coarse-grained simulations reproduced some of the experimental features and revealed substrate-dependent MMP1 dynamics. Our results suggest that an inter-domain separation facilitates opening up the catalytic pocket so that the collagen chains come closer to the MMP1 active site. Coordination of functional conformations at different parts of MMP1 occurs via allosteric communications that can take place via interactions mediated by collagen even if the linker between the domains is absent. Modeling dynamics as a Poisson process enables connecting the picosecond timescales of molecular dynamics simulations with the millisecond timescales of single molecule measurements. Water-soluble MMP1 interacting with water-insoluble collagen fibrils poses challenges for biochemical studies that the single molecule tracking can overcome for other insoluble substrates. Inter-domain communications are likely important for multidomain proteins.\n\nStatement of SignificanceIt is often challenging to distinguish functionally important dynamics because proteins are inherently flexible. MMP1 is a model enzyme because both the catalytic and hemopexin domains are necessary to degrade triple-helical type-1 collagen, the highly proteolysis-resistant structural component of the extracellular matrix. We report, for the first time, measurements of MMP1 inter-domain dynamics on type-1 collagen fibrils. We have identified functionally relevant MMP1 conformations where the two domains are far apart. Mutations and ligands can allosterically modulate the dynamics that correlate with activity. The dynamics follow a two-state Poisson process that connects the picosecond timescales of MD simulations with the millisecond timescales of experiments. The two domains can functionally communicate via collagen even when the physical linker is absent.",

    "abstract": "Temperature plays a fundamental role in biology, influencing cellular function, affecting chemical reaction rates, molecular structures, and interactions. While the temperature dependence of many biochemical reactions is well defined in vitro, the effect of temperature on metabolic function at the network level is not well understood but remains an important challenge in optimizing the storage of cells and tissues at lower temperatures. Here, we have used time-course metabolomics data and systems biology approaches to characterize the effects of storage temperature on human platelets (PLTs) in platelet additive solution. We observed that changes to the metabolome with storage time do not simply scale with temperature but instead display complex temperature dependence, with only a small subset of metabolites following an Arrhenius-type. Investigation of PLT energy metabolism through integration with computational modeling revealed that oxidative metabolism is more sensitive to temperature changes than is glycolysis. The increased contribution of glycolysis to ATP turnover at lower temperature indicates a stronger glycolytic phenotype with decreasing storage temperature. More broadly, these results demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the PLT metabolic network is not uniform, suggesting that efforts to improve the health of stored PLTs could be targeted at specific pathways.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceThe temperature dependence of cellular metabolism is difficult to study due to regulatory events that are activated upon deviation from the optimal temperature range. Platelets are blood components used in transfusion medicine but also serve as a model cell to study human energy metabolism in the absence of genetic regulation. We investigated changes in platelet metabolism at temperatures spanning from 4 {degrees}C-37 {degrees}C using a quantitative metabolic systems biology approach as opposed to assessing individual reactions. We found that energy producing metabolic pathways have different temperature sensitivities. The results define the metabolic response to temperature on the metabolic pathway level and are of importance for understanding the cryopreservation of human platelets and more complex human cells used in cellular therapy.",

    "abstract": "Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum depends on the presence of mature gametocytes that can be ingested by mosquitoes taking a bloodmeal when feeding on human skin. It has long been hypothesised that skin sequestration contributes to efficient transmission. Although skin sequestration would have major implications for our understanding of transmission biology and the suitability of mosquito feeding methodologies to measure the human infectious reservoir, it has never been formally tested. In two populations of naturally infected gametocyte carriers from Burkina Faso, we assessed transmission potential to mosquitoes and directly quantified male and female gametocytes and asexual parasites in: i) finger prick blood, ii) venous blood, iii) skin biopsies, and in pools of mosquitoes that fed iv) on venous blood or, v) directly on the skin. Whilst more mosquitoes became infected when feeding directly on the skin compared to venous blood, concentrations of gametocytes in the subdermal skin vasculature were identical to that in other blood compartments. Asexual parasite densities, gametocyte densities and sex ratios were identical in the mosquito blood meals taken directly from the skin of parasite carriers and their venous blood.\\n\\nWe also observed sparse gametocytes in skin biopsies from legs and arms of gametocyte carriers by microscopy. Taken together, we provide conclusive evidence for the absence of significant skin sequestration of P. falciparum gametocytes. Gametocyte densities in peripheral blood are thus informative for predicting onward transmission potential to mosquitoes. Quantifying this human malaria transmission potential is of pivotal importance for the deployment and monitoring of malaria elimination initiatives.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEOur observations settle a long-standing question in the malaria field and close a major knowledge gap in the parasite cycle. By deploying mosquito feeding experiments and stage-specific molecular and immunofluorescence parasite detection methodologies in two populations of naturally infected parasite carriers, we conclusively reject the hypothesis of gametocyte skin sequestration. Our findings provide novel insights in parasite stage composition in human blood compartments, mosquito bloodmeals and their implications for transmission potential. We demonstrate that gametocyte levels in venous or finger prick blood can be used to predict onward transmission potential to mosquitoes. Our findings thus pave the way for methodologies to quantify the human infectious reservoir based on conventional blood sampling approaches to support the deployment and monitoring of malaria elimination efforts for maximum public health impact.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of senescent cells is an important contributor to chronic inflammation upon aging. While cytoplasmic DNA was shown to drive the inflammatory phenotype of senescent cells, an equivalent role for RNA has never been explored. Here, we show that some senescent cells accumulate long promoter RNAs and 3 gene extensions, rich in retrotransposon sequences. Accordingly, these cells display increased expression of genes involved in detecting double stranded RNA of viral origin downstream of the interferon pathway. The RNA accumulation is correlated with signs of reduced RNA turn-over, including in some cases, reduced expression of RNA exosome subunits. Reciprocally, engineered inactivation of RNA exosome subunit Exosc3 induces expression of multiple senescence markers. A senescence-like RNA accumulation is also observed in cells exposed to oxidative stress, an important trigger of cellular senescence. Altogether, we propose that in a subset of senescent cells, repeat-containing transcripts stabilized by oxidative stress or reduced RNA exosome activity participate, possibly in combination with cytoplasmic DNA, in driving and maintaining the permanent inflammatory state characterizing cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "Protein ubiquitination is a very diverse post-translational modification leading to protein degradation or delocalization, or altering protein activity. In Arabidopsis thaliana, two E3 ligases, BIG BROTHER (BB) and DA2, activate the latent peptidases DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 by mono-ubiquitination at multiple sites. Subsequently, these activated peptidases destabilize various positive regulators of growth. Here, we show that two ubiquitin-specific proteases, UBP12 and UBP13, deubiquitinate DA1, DAR1 and DAR2, hence reducing their peptidase activity. Overexpression of UBP12 or UBP13 strongly decreased leaf size and cell area, and resulted in lower ploidy levels. Mutants in which UBP12 and UBP13 were downregulated produced smaller leaves that contained fewer and smaller cells. Remarkably, neither UBP12 nor UBP13 were found to be cleavage substrates of the activated DA1. Our results therefore suggest that UBP12 and UBP13 work upstream of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 to restrict their protease activity and hence fine-tune plant growth and development.",

In particular, with the advent of new and cheap additive manufacturing technologies, the open-source design of lab hardware enables others to perform research that would be difficult otherwise. This manuscript describes an air-jet system designed to be open-source and simple to produce with 3D printing. The fully 3D printed air-jet was designed for the generation of hydrogel microbeads of a controllable size. Alginate microbeads were used as a working model, given that it has many promising research applications due to their injectability and highly reproducible properties. A fit definitive design of experiments was performed to determine critical factors affecting diameter, index of dispersity, and circularity of microbeads from this air-jet design. By regulating alginate concentration, air pressure, pump speed, and needle diameter could achieve control over microbeads size from 200-800 {micro}m with low variance. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential probiotic research applications of the open-source air-jet through the encapsulation of bacteria in alginate microbeads with controllable degradation. The results of this study exhibit an open-source platform for making microscale biomaterials with controllable properties that can be achieved through budget 3D printers.",

    "abstract": "Tropical regions are subjected to rapid land use changes altering species composition and diversity in communities. The non-Apis bees are vital invertebrates continued to be highly neglected in the tropics. We compared their diversity status, richness and composition across natural areas and agroecosystems in Doon valley, a subtropical-temperate landscape situated at the foothills of outer Himalayas in India. We investigated how two major habitats relate to non-Apis bee diversity, specifically seeking answers to (1) Whether natural habitat is a refuge to richer and rarer bee communities than agroecosystems? (2) Are natural habitats important for supporting wild bee populations in agroecosystems? (3) Do polyculture farms behave similar to natural habitats and therefore support richer bee communities than monoculture? Observation and pantrap sampling were used to collect data. We recorded 43 species belonging to bees of five families. The findings of our investigation demonstrate the importance of natural habitats as a potential refuge for non-Apis bees. The findings highlighted that Doon valley harboured twenty-five rare species of non-Apis bees, and natural habitats are a refuge to 11 rare specialist species (clamtest; Specialization threshold K = 2/3, Alpha level = 0.005). Natural habitat diversity in Doon valley supports bee communities in nearby agroecosystems (R2 = 0.782, SE = 0.148, P = 0.004). Polyculture practices in agroecosystems (<100m from forest H = 2.15; >100m from forest = 2.08) in the valley mimic natural habitats (H = 2.37) and support diverse non-Apis bee communities (2.08) in comparison to monocultures (<100m from forest H = 2.13; >100m from forest =1.56). Bees evolved with flowering plants over 120 million years and they suffice an ever-growing anthropogenic nutrition needs with their services through enhanced agricultural production in pursuit of forage. We finally recommend similar assessments of bee diversity and plants they support in different habitats and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Chronic wasting disease is a prion disease affecting both free-ranging and farmed cervids in North America and Scandinavia. A range of cervid species have been found to be susceptible, each with variations in the gene for the normal prion protein, PRNP, reportedly influencing both disease susceptibility and progression in the respective hosts. Despite the finding of several different PRNP alleles in whitetail deer, the majority of past research has focused on two of the more common alleles identified - the 96G and 96S alleles. In the present study, we evaluate both infection status and disease stage in nearly 2100 farmed deer depopulated in the United States and Canada, including 714 CWD-positive deer and correlate our findings with PRNP genotype, including the more rare 95H, 116G, and 226K alleles. We found significant differences in either likelihood of being found infected or disease stage (and in many cases both) at the time of depopulation in all genotypes present, relative to the most common 96GG genotype. Despite high prevalence in many of the herds examined, infection was not found in several of the reported genotypes. These findings suggest that additional research is necessary to more properly define the role that these genotypes may play in managing CWD in both farmed and free-ranging whitetail deer, with consideration for factors including relative fitness levels, incubation periods, and the kinetics of shedding in animals with these rare genotypes.",

    "abstract": "The global HIV-1 pandemic comprises many genetically divergent subtypes. Most of our understanding of drug resistance in HIV-1 derives from subtype B, which predominates in North America and western Europe. However, about 90% of the pandemic represents non-subtype B infections. Here, we use deep sequencing to analyze HIV-1 from infected individuals in Uganda who were either treatment-naive or who experienced virologic failure on ART without the expected patterns of drug resistance. Our objective was to detect potentially novel associations between mutations in HIV-1 integrase and treatment outcomes in Uganda, where most infections are subtypes A or D. We retrieved a total of 380 archived plasma samples from patients at the Joint Clinical Research Centre (Kampala), of which 328 were integrase inhibitor-naive and 52 were raltegravir (RAL)-based treatment failures. Next, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline for alignment and variant calling of the deep sequence data obtained from these samples from a MiSeq platform (Illumina). To detect associations between within-patient polymorphisms and treatment outcomes, we used a support vector machine (SVM) for feature selection with multiple imputation to account for partial reads and low quality base calls. Candidate point mutations of interest were experimentally introduced into the HIV-1 subtype B NL4-3 backbone to determine susceptibility to RAL in U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells. Finally, we carried out replication capacity experiments with wild-type and mutant viruses in TZM-bl cells in the presence and absence of RAL. Our analyses not only identified the known major mutation N155H and accessory mutations G163R and V151I, but also novel mutations I203M and I208L as most highly associated with RAL failure. The I203M and I208L mutations resulted in significantly decreased susceptibility to RAL (44.0-fold and 54.9-fold, respectively) compared to wild-type virus (EC50=0.32 nM), and may represent novel pathways of HIV-1 resistance to modern treatments.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThere are many different types of HIV-1 around the world. Most of the research on how HIV-1 can become resistant to drug treatment has focused on the type (B) that is the most common in high-income countries. However, about 90% of infections around the world are caused by a type other than B. We used next-generation sequencing to analyze samples of HIV-1 from patients in Uganda (mostly infected by types A and D) for whom drug treatment failed to work, and whose infections did not fit the classic pattern of adaptation based on B. Next, we used machine learning to detect mutations in these virus populations that could explain the treatment outcomes. Finally, we experimentally added two candidate mutations identified by our analysis to a laboratory strain of HIV-1 and confirmed that they conferred drug resistance to the virus. Our study reveals new pathways that other types of HIV-1 may use to evolve resistance to drugs that make up the current recommended treatment for newly diagnosed individuals.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining cognitive health across the lifespan has been the focus of a multi-billion-dollar industry. In order to guide treatment and interventions, a clear understanding of the way that proficiency in different cognitive domains develops and declines across the lifespan is necessary. Additionally, there are gender differences in a range of other factors, such as anxiety and substance use, that are also known to affect cognition, although the scale of this interaction is unknown. Our objective was to assess differences in cognitive function across the lifespan in men and women in a large, representative sample. Leveraging online cognitive testing, a sample of 18,902 men and women ranging in age from 12-69 matched on socio-demographic factors were studied. Segmented regression was used to model three cognitive domains - short-term memory, verbal abilities, and reasoning. Gender differences in all three domains were minimal; however, after broadening the sample in terms of socio-demographic factors, gender differences appeared. These results suggest that cognition across the lifespan differs for men and women, but is greatly influenced by environmental factors. We discuss these findings within a framework that describes gender differences in cognition as likely guided by a complex interplay between biology and environment.",

Parents completed the ADHD Rating Scale IV, a norm-referenced checklist that evaluates ADHD symptomatology according to diagnostic criteria, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version. Children completed the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence and the Forward Digit Span task. Longitudinal data including perinatal clinical, qualitative MRI classification, socio-demographic variables and neurodevelopmental disabilities were investigated in relation to ADHD symptomatology. All results were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate. Results showed that although the proportion of very preterm children with clinically significant ADHD did not differ from normative data after excluding those with neurodevelopmental disabilities, 32.7% met criteria for subthreshold ADHD inattentive type and 33.6% for combined type, which was higher than the expected 20% in normative samples. Higher ADHD symptom scores (all) were associated with greater executive dysfunction (inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and emergent metacognition, corrected p<0.001 for all tests). Higher inattentive ADHD symptom scores were associated with lower IQ ({rho}=-0.241, p=0.036) and higher perinatal clinical risk (more days on mechanical ventilation ({rho}=0.206, p=0.025) and more days on parenteral nutrition ({rho}=0.223, p=0.015)). Higher hyperactive ADHD symptom scores instead were associated with lower socio-economic status ({rho}=0.278, p=0.002). These results highlight the importance of monitoring and supporting the development of very preterm children throughout the school years, as subthreshold ADHD symptoms represent risk factors for psychosocial problems and for receiving a future clinical diagnosis of ADHD.",

    "abstract": "A key event in the development of both major forms of diabetes is the loss of functional pancreatic islet {beta}-cell mass. Strategies aimed at enhancing {beta}-cell regeneration have long been pursued, but methods for reliably inducing human {beta}-cell proliferation with full retention of key functions such as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) are still very limited. We have previously reported that overexpression of the homeobox transcription factor Nkx6.1 stimulates {beta}-cell proliferation, while also enhancing GSIS and providing protection against {beta}-cell cytotoxicity through induction of the VGF prohormone. We developed an Nkx6.1 pathway screen by stably transfecting 832/13 rat insulinoma cells with a VGF promoter-luciferase reporter construct, using the resultant cell line to screen a 630,000 compound chemical library. We isolated three compounds with consistent effects to stimulate human islet cell proliferation. Further studies of the most potent of these compounds, GNF-9228, revealed that it selectively activates human {beta}-cell relative to -cell proliferation and has no effect on {delta}-cell replication. In addition, pre-treatment, but not short term exposure of human islets to GNF-9228 enhances GSIS. GNF-9228 also protects 832/13 insulinoma cells against ER stress- and inflammatory cytokine-induced cytotoxicity. In contrast to recently emergent Dyrk1a inhibitors that stimulate human islet cell proliferation, GNF-9228 does not activate NFAT translocation. These studies have led to identification of a small molecule with pleiotropic positive effects on islet biology, including stimulation of human {beta}-cell proliferation and insulin secretion, and protection against multiple agents of cytotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "Although climate change is altering the productivity and distribution of marine fisheries, climate-adaptive fisheries management could mitigate many of the negative impacts on human society. We forecast global fisheries biomass, catch, and profits to 2100 under three climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and five levels of management reform to (1) determine the impact of climate change on national fisheries and (2) quantify the national-scale benefits of implementing climate-adaptive fisheries reforms. Management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and shifting distributions would yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today for 60-65% of countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but for only 35% of countries under the most severe scenario. Furthermore, these management reforms would yield higher cumulative catch and profits than business-as-usual management for nearly all countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but would yield lower cumulative catch for 40% of countries under the most severe scenario. Fortunately, perfect fisheries management is not necessary to achieve these benefits: transboundary cooperation with 5-year intervals between adaptive interventions would result in comparable outcomes. However, the ability for realistic management reforms to offset the negative impacts of climate change is bounded by changes in underlying biological productivity. Although realistic reforms could generate higher catch and profits for 23-50% of countries experiencing reductions in productivity, the remaining countries would need to develop, expand, and reform aquaculture and other food production sectors to offset losses in capture fisheries. Still, climate-adaptive management is more profitable than business-as-usual management in all countries and we provide guidance on implementing - and achieving the benefits of - climate-adaptive fisheries reform along a gradient of scientific, management, and enforcement capacities.",

    "abstract": "Biodeterioration, the alteration caused by living organisms, on historical buildings and stone monuments is a well-known problem affecting two-thirds of the worlds cultural heritage. The study of the flora growing on wall surface is of particular importance for the assessment of the risk of biodeterioration of stone artifacts by vascular plants, and for maintenance planning. In this study, we investigate how rock type, exposure and inclination of the wall affect the biodeteriogenic flora at 13 sites of the Archaeological Park of the Phlegraean Fields located in the province of Naples, in southern Italy. For each site, we analysed randomly selected square areas with 2 x 2 m size, representing the different vegetation types in terms of vascular plant species cover. The total number of plant species recorded was 129, belonging to 43 families. Erigeron sumatrensis, Sonchus tenerrimus, and Parietaria judaica are the most commonly reported species, while Capparis orientalis is the species with the highest average coverage. Substrate type, exposure and surface inclination affect the floristic composition, with the average plant cover significantly higher on vertical surfaces and at western and southern exposure. All the main biodeteriogenic vascular plant species grow on more or less porous lythotype like yellow tufa, conglomerate and bricks. Finally, woody plants eradications methods are proposed by the tree cutting and local application of herbicides, to avoid stump and root sprouting and to minimize the dispersion of chemicals in the surrounding environment.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodelling complexes of the SWI/SNF family function in the formation of nucleosome-depleted regions and transcriptionally active promoters in the eukaryote genome. The structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SWI/SNF family member RSC in complex with a nucleosome substrate reveals five protein modules and suggests key features of the remodelling mechanism. A DNA-interacting module grasps extra-nucleosomal DNA and helps to recruit RSC to promoters. The ATPase and arm modules sandwich the nucleosome disc with their  SnAC and  finger elements, respectively. The translocase motor engages with the edge of the nucleosome at superhelical location +2 to pump DNA along the nucleosome, resulting in a sliding of the histone octamer along DNA. The results elucidate how nucleosome-depleted regions are formed and provide a basis for understanding human chromatin remodelling complexes of the SWI/SNF family and the consequences of cancer mutations that frequently occur in these complexes.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration research has become a high-content field. However, the quantitative information encapsulated in these complex and high-dimensional datasets is not fully exploited due to the diversity of experimental protocols and non-standardised output formats. In addition, typically the datasets are not open for reuse. Making the data open and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) will enable meta-analysis, data integration, and data mining. Standardised data formats and controlled vocabularies are essential for building a suitable infrastructure for that purpose but are not available in the cell migration domain. We here present standardisation efforts by the Cell Migration Standardisation Organization, CMSO, an open community-driven organisation to facilitate the development of standards for cell migration data. This work will foster the development of improved algorithms and tools, and enable secondary analysis of public datasets, ultimately unlocking new knowledge of the complex biological process of cell migration.",
