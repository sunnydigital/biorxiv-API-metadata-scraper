    "abstract": "Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a polyphagous gram-negative bacterial plant pathogen that can infect more than 300 plant species. It is endemic in America while, in 2013, Xf subsp. pauca was for the first time reported in Europe on olive tree in the Southern Italy. The availability of fast and reliable diagnostic tools is indispensable for managing current and future outbreaks of Xf.\n\nIn this work, we used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) device MinION platform for detecting and identifying Xf at species, subspecies and Sequence Type (ST) level straight from infected plant material. The study showed the possibility to detect Xf by direct DNA sequencing and identify the subspecies in highly infected samples. In order to improve sensitivity, Nanopore amplicon sequencing was assessed. Using primers within the set of the seven MLST officially adopted for identifying Xf at type strain level, we developed a workflow consisting in a multiple PCR and an ad hoc pipeline to generate MLST consensus after Nanopore-sequencing of the amplicons. The here-developed combined approach achieved a sensitivity higher than real-time PCR allowing within few hours, the detection and identification of Xf at ST level in infected plant material, also at low level of contamination.\n\nOriginality Significance StatementIn this work we developed a methodology that allows the detection and identification of Xylella fastidiosa in plant using the Nanopore technology portable device MinION. The approach that we develop resulted more sensitive than methods currently used for detecting X. fastidiosa, like real-time PCR. This approach can be extensively used for X. fastidiosa detection and it may pave the road for the detection of other tedious vascular pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is pivotal for their development, physiology and disease treatment. A single cell on a 2D surface can utilize continuous or discontinuous migration modes. To comprehend the cell migration, an adequate quantification for single cell-based analysis is crucial. An automatized approach could alleviate tedious manual analysis, facilitating large-scale drug screening. Supervised deep learning has shown promising outcomes in computerized microscopy image analysis. However, their implication is limited due to the scarcity of carefully annotated data and uncertain deterministic outputs. We compare three deep learning models to study the problem of learning discriminative morphological representations using weakly annotated data for predicting the cell migration modes. We also estimate Bayesian uncertainty to describe the confidence of the probabilistic predictions. Amongst three compared models, DenseNet yielded the best results with a sensitivity of 87.91% {+/-} 13.22 at a false negative rate of 1.26% {+/-} 4.18.",

Mandrills looked most frequently at foraging individuals and least frequently at sleeping invividuals. Mandrills also looked at grooming individuals more than at individuals that were simply sitting in contact. Grooming dyads were looked at regardless of the social rank and kinship of the individuals involved. These results contribute to our understanding of how primates obtain their social knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Disturbed biological oscillations often represent pathology and thus have a prognostic character. The most studied are 24-h (circadian) and shorter (ultradian) oscillations from them. A cosinor analysis often evaluates the presence and significance of circadian and ultradian rhythms. Skilled researchers can use MATLAB, R, Python, or other programming languages, while those less experienced often use outdated applications that require a specific operating system version or outdated add-ons. Therefore, we developed CosinorOnline, a simple web-based application coded in PHP and JavaScript to evaluate the presence and significance of different oscillations. Users can set the period length on the applications page and insert their data. The results consist of a numerical evaluation and an adjustable plot. There is also a unique identifier to reload or immediately delete data analysis within one month. After this period, all data are automatically deleted from the app. We compared the functionality of CosinorOnline with Cosinor2 (R package) and Chronos-Fit (Windows app). The 24-h variability analysis was identical for all three applications. The evaluation of ultradian variability was the same for CosinorOnline and Cosinor2 and slightly different for Chronos-Fit. CosinorOnline and Chronos-Fit result in acrophase in units of time (decimal form), while Cosinor2 is in radians. In conclusion, CosinorOnline is a simple, easy-to-use web application to inspect time data that provides reliable results without additional installation and runs in modern web browsers. The application does not track users and aims to help users quickly decide whether their data is suitable for more profound analysis using cosinor analysis.",

However, larger-scale changes in the kinetochore architecture may also affect Delta. To test this possibility, we measure Delta in long kinetochores of Indian muntjac (IM) whose shape, size, and orientation are discernable in conventional light microscopy. We find that architecture of IM kinetochores and the value of Delta change minimally when microtubule-mediated forces are suppressed by Taxol. In contrast, large decreases of Delta observed in Taxol-treated human cells coincide with prominent changes in length and shape of the kinetochore. We also find that inner and outer kinetochore proteins intermix within a common spatial compartment instead of forming separate thin layers. These observations, supported by computational modelling, suggest that changes in Delta reflect changes in the kinetochore shape rather than the level of IKT.",

Although components used to build these complexes have been well defined, we still have only a limited understanding of the structure of the Sin3/HDAC subunits as they are assembled around the scaffolding protein SIN3A. To characterize the spatial arrangement of Sin3 subunits, we combined Halo affinity capture, chemical cross-linking and high-resolution mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to determine intersubunit distance constraints, identifying 66 high-confidence interprotein and 63 high-confidence self cross-links for 13 Sin3 subunits. To validate our XL-MS data, we first mapped self cross-links onto existing structures to verify that cross-link distances were consistent with cross-linker length and subsequently deleted crosslink hotspot regions within the SIN3A scaffolding protein which then failed to capture crosslinked partners. Having assessed cross-link authenticity, we next used distance restraints from interprotein cross-links to guide assembly of a Sin3 complex substructure. We identified the relative positions of subunits SAP30L, HDAC1, SUDS3, HDAC2, and ING1 around the SIN3A scaffold. The architecture of this subassembly suggests that multiple factors have space to assemble to collectively influence the behavior of the catalytic subunit HDAC1.",

    "abstract": "Structural and spectroscopic analysis of iron-sulfur [Fe-S] cluster-containing proteins is often limited by the occupancy and yield of recombinantly produced proteins. Here we report that Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), a strain routinely used to overexpress [Fe-S] cluster-containing proteins, has a nonfunctional Suf pathway, one of two E. coli [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis pathways. We confirmed that BL21(DE3) and commercially available derivatives carry a deletion that results in an inframe fusion of sufA and sufB genes within the sufABCDSE operon. We show that this fusion protein accumulates in cells but is - inactive in [Fe-S] biogenesis. Restoration of an intact Suf pathway combined with enhanced suf operon expression led to a remarkable (~3-fold) increase in the production of the [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing BchL protein, a key component of the dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxido-reductase complex. These results show that this engineered  SufFeScient derivative of BL21(DE3) is suitable for enhanced large-scale synthesis of an [Fe-S] cluster-containing protein.\\n\\nIMPORTANCELarge quantities of recombinantly overexpressed iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins are necessary for their in-depth biochemical characterization. Commercially available E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and its derivatives have a mutation that inactivates the function of one of the two native pathways (Suf pathway) responsible for cluster biogenesis. Correction of the mutation, combined with sequence changes that increase Suf expression can increase yield and cluster occupancy of [Fe-S] cluster-containing enzymes, facilitating the biochemical analysis of this fascinating group of proteins.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that SLC19A1 is an importer of the immunotransmitter 23-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP)1 by performing a genome wide screen in U937 cells. Soon after, Lutejin et al. reported similar findings by conducting a screen in THP-1 cells2. While the conclusions of these two studies largely overlap, we arrived at significantly different conclusions regarding how broadly SLC19A1 is used by different cell types. Our study suggests that in addition to SLC19A1, many cultured and primary cell types use alternative, unidentified transporters to import cGAMP and other cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). This conclusion was based on our findings that inhibition of SLC19A1 did not significantly reduce extracellular cGAMP signaling in multiple cell types, including primary CD14+peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from most donors. In contrast, Luteijn et al. concluded that SLC19A1 is the major CDN importer in humans, largely based on their use of a radiolabeled [32P] cGAMP uptake assay. Using this assay, they showed that inhibition of SLC19A1 abolishes [32P] uptake in total PBMCs. However, they did not test whether inhibition of SLC19A1 affects extracellular cGAMP signaling in these cells. Here, we highlight an important issue with the [32P] cGAMP uptake assay used by Luteijn et al. and demonstrate that measuring extracellular cGAMP signaling through the STING pathway is currently the best method for evaluating cGAMP import. We also show that inhibition of SLC19A1 has no effect on extracellular cGAMP signaling in total PBMCs, confirming that this cell type relies on other transport mechanisms for cGAMP import.",

    "abstract": "To gain insight into crystalline protein dynamics, we performed molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of a periodic 2x2x2 supercell of staphylococcal nuclease. We used the resulting MD trajectories to simulate X-ray diffraction and to study collective motions. The agreement of simulated X-ray diffraction with the data is comparable to previous MD simulation studies. We studied collective motions by analyzing statistically the covariance of alpha-carbon position displacements. The covariance decreases exponentially with the distance between atoms, which is consistent with a liquid-like motions (LLM) model, in which the protein behaves like a soft material. To gain finer insight into the collective motions, we examined the covariance behavior within a protein molecule (intra-protein) and between different protein molecules (inter-protein). The inter-protein atom pairs, which dominate the overall statistics, exhibit LLM behavior; however, the intra-protein pairs exhibit behavior that is consistent with a superposition of LLM and rigid-body motions (RBM). Our results indicate that LLM behavior of global dynamics is present in MD simulations of a protein crystal. They also show that RBM behavior is detectable in the simulations but that it is subsumed by the LLM behavior. Finally the results provide clues about how correlated motions of atom pairs both within and across proteins might manifest in diffraction data. Overall our findings increase our understanding of the connection between molecular motions and diffraction data, and therefore advance efforts to extract information about functionally important motions from crystallography experiments.",

    "abstract": "Various diseases cause over-expression of the serum amyloid A protein (SAA), which leads in some, but not all, cases to amyloidosis as a secondary disease. The response to the over-expression involves dissociation of SAA hexamer and subsequent cleavage of the released monomers, most commonly yielding fragments SAA1-76 of the full-sized SAA1-104. We report results from molecular dynamic simulations that probe the role of this cleavage for down-regulating activity and the concentration of SAA. We propose a mechanism that relies on two elements. First, the probability to assemble into hexamers is lower for the fragments than it is for the full-sized protein. Second, unlike other fragments SAA1-76 can switch between two distinct configurations. The first kind is easy to proteolyze (allowing a fast reduction of SAA concentration) but prone to aggregation, while the situation is opposite for the second kind. If the time scale for amyloid formation is longer than the one for proteolysis, the aggregation-prone species dominates. However, if environmental conditions such as low pH increase the risk of amyloid formation, the ensemble shifts toward the more protected form. We speculate that SAA amyloidosis is a failure of the switching mechanism leading to accumulation of the aggregation-prone species and subsequent amyloid formation.",

    "abstract": "Tensor factorization has emerged as a powerful method to address the challenges of high dimensionality regarding disease development and comorbidity. Chronic diseases have a high likelihood to co-occur, making patients suffering from one chronic disease to have an elevated risk for the other diseases in the course of aging. Individualized prediction of chronic diseases can help patients prevent new diseases and reduce the healthcare costs. Despite rich results of risk assessment models for chronic diseases, individualized risk prediction considering the complex mechanisms of disease development and comorbidity remains to be under-researched. This research aims to develop tensor factorization-based machine learning models to predict the onset of new chronic diseases for individual patients through incorporating the comorbidity patterns with the clinical and sequential factors revealed in the electronic health records (EHR) data. We propose two tensor factorization-based methods to incorporate the clinical and sequential factors to reveal the latent patterns of co-occurring chronic diseases. The efficacy of the proposed methods was validated through predicting the onset of new chronic diseases for individual patients using the EHR data for 23 years from a major hospital in Hong Kong. The proposed methods consistently outperform benchmark predictive models. The top 10 predictions of new chronic diseases have approximately 60% recall. Tensor factorization is an appropriate method for predicting the onset of chronic diseases at the individual level. The proposed predictive models could inform proactive health management programs for at-risk patients with different chronic conditions at discharge.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe existing risk assessment models mainly focused on the prediction of single diseases in the population base. Chronic disease risk prediction considering the complex mechanisms of disease development and comorbidity is under-researched. To support and inform clinical decision making for healthcare professionals in the aging society, this study provides an innovative approach to mapping an interconnected web of chronic illnesses and investigated the performance of chronic disease prediction using 2 years worth of patient assessment records and 23 years admission history data from a major hospital in Hong Kong. We proposed matrix and tensor-based methods to represent the high-order interrelations of patients, chronic diseases and additional features, which can reveal the latent patterns of co-occurring chronic diseases to enable more effective prediction. The proposed methods exhibit state-of-the-art performance in predicting the onset of new chronic diseases for individual patients.",

It was also predicted that 35 genes variations were related to the multidrug and toxic efflux (MATE) transporter, chalcone synthase (CHS), ATPase isoform 10 (AHA10) transporter, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR), the laccase 15 (LAC15), flavonol 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), O-methyltransferase (OMT), flavonoid 3'5' hydroxylase (F3'5'H), UDP-glucose:sterol-glucosyltransferase (SGT), flavonol synthase (FLS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI) involved in the tannin synthesis. These results would provide theoretical supports for the molecular markers developments and gene function studies related to the liquor-making traits, and the genetic improvement of waxy sorghum based on the genome editing technology.",

    "abstract": "Kisspeptin along with its receptor GPR54 or KISS1R regulates the secretion of hormones involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, which is one of the contributing factors of adolescent spermatogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between serum kisspeptin concentration and spermatogenic function, and its predictive value in azoospermia. We retrospectively analyzed data of 196 males who visited the Reproductive Medicine Center of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University from June-November 2018; 20 were fertile and 176 were infertile. The following semen tests were performed: serum kisspeptin level by enzyme immunoassay; and levels of follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones, and testosterone by chemiluminescence assay. Percutaneous testicular sperm aspiration was performed on males with azoospermia. Subjects were divided into 5 groups: azoospermia (group A: 22 men with obstructive azoospermia; group B: 54 men with non-obstructive azoospermia), oligospermia (group C: 56 men), infertility with normal semen concentration (group D: 44 men), and fertility with normal semen concentration (group E: 20 men). Kisspeptin levels in the fertile group were higher than those in the infertile group. Levels of serum hormones, testosterone, and kisspeptin correlated with sperm concentration, with the strongest correlation between kisspeptin and sperm concentration (correlation coefficient=0.692). Levels of kisspeptin in obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia groups were analyzed using Receiver-Operating-Curve analysis. A serum kisspeptin level [&ge;]80.655 was classified as obstructive azoospermia; otherwise, the classification was non-obstructive azoospermia. Serum kisspeptin levels in the fertility group were significantly higher than that in the infertility group; this suggests kisspeptin may be associated with male fertility. Moreover, kisspeptin had a stronger correlation with sperm concentration than the hormones. A serum kisspeptin level of 80.655 can be used to differentiate obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and water are four crucial factors that have significant effects on strawberry yield and fruit quality. A quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination experiment that involved 36 treatments with five levels of the four variables (N, P, and K fertilizers and water) was executed to optimize the fertilization and water combination for high yield and quality. SSC/TA ratio (the ratio of soluble solid content to titratable acid) was selected as the index of quality. Results showed that the N fertilizer was the most important factor, followed by water and P fertilizer, and the N fertilizer had a significant effect on yield and SSC/TA ratio. By contrast, the K fertilizer had a significant effect only on yield. NxK fertilizer interaction had a significant effect on yield, whereas the other interactions among the four factors had no significant effects on yield and SSC/TA ratio. The effects of the four factors on the yield and SSC/TA ratio were ranked as N fertilizer > water > K fertilizer > P fertilizer and N fertilizer > P fertilizer > water > K fertilizer, respectively. The yield and SSC/TA ratio increased and then decreased when NPK fertilizer and water increased. The optimal fertilizer and water combination was 22.28-24.61 g/plant Ca (NO3)2*4H2O, 1.75-2.03 g/plant NaH2PO4, 12.41-13.91 g/plant K2SO4, and 12.00- 13.05 L/plant water for yields of more than 110 g/plant and optimal SSC/TA ratio of 8.5-14.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA relatively simple life history allows us to derive an expression for the extinction probability of populations of tsetse, vectors of African sleeping sickness. We present the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of extinction probability for tsetse population, to offer key insights into parameters in the control/eradication of tsetse populations.\n\nMethodsWe represent tsetse population growth as a branching process, and derive closed form estimates of population extinction from that model. Statistical and mathematical techniques are used to analyse the uncertainties in estimating extinction probability, and the sensitivity of the extinction probability to changes in input parameters representing the natural life history and vital dynamics of tsetse populations.\n\nResultsFor fixed values of input parameters, the sensitivity of extinction probability depends on the baseline parameter values. For example, extinction probability is more sensitive to the probability that a female is inseminated by a fertile male when daily pupal mortality is low, whereas the extinction probability is more sensitive to daily mortality rate for adult females when daily pupal mortality, and extinction probabilities, are high. Global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis showed that daily mortality rate for adult females has the highest impact on the extinction probability.\n\nConclusionsThe strong correlation between extinction probability and daily female adult mortality gives a strong argument that control techniques to increase daily female adult mortality may be the single most effective means of ensuring eradication of tsetse population.\n\nAuthor summaryTsetse flies (Glossina spp) are vectors of Trypanosomiasis, a deadly disease commonly called sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock. The relatively simple life history of tsetse enabled us to model its population growth as a stochastic branching process. We derived a closed-form expression for the probability that a population of tsetse goes extinct, as a function of death, birth, development and insemination rates in female tsetse. We analyzed the sensitivity of the extinction probability to the different input parameters, in a bid to identify parameters with the highest impact on extinction probability. This information can, potentially, inform policy direction for tsetse control/elimination. In all the scenarios we considered, the daily mortality rate for adult females has the greatest impact on the magnitude of extinction probability. Our findings suggest that the mortality rate in the adult females is the weakest link in tsetse life history, and this fact should be exploited in achieving tsetse population control, or even elimination.",

    "abstract": "Pitch perception provides important information for musical and vocal communication. Numerous studies have shown that musical training and expertise are associated with better pitch processing, however, it is unclear what types of pitch percepts are plastic with music training. The current study addresses this issue by measuring discrimination thresholds of Musicians (n=20) and Non-musicians (n=18) to diotic (same sound to both ears) and dichotic (different sounds to each ear) stimuli created from four types of acoustic computations:1) pure sinusoidal tones, PT; 2) four-harmonic complex tones, CT; 3) iterated rippled noise, IRN; and 4) interaurally correlated broadband noise, called \\\"Huggins\\\" or \\\"dichotic\\\" pitch sounds, DP. Frequency Difference Limens (DLF) in each condition were obtained via a 3-alternative-forced-choice adaptive task requiring selection of the interval with the highest pitch, yielding the smallest perceptible fundamental frequency (F0) distance (in Hz) between two sounds. Music skill was measured by an online test of musical Pitch, Melody and Timing (International Laboratory for Brain Music and Sound Research, https://www.brams.org/en/onlinetest/). Musicianship, length of music experience and self-evaluation of musical skill were assessed by questionnaire. Results showed musicians had smaller DLFs in all four conditions and that thresholds were related to subjective and objective musical ability. In addition, self-report of musical ability was shown to be a significant variable in group classification, suggesting that the neurobehavioral profile of musicians includes self-evaluation of musical competence.",
