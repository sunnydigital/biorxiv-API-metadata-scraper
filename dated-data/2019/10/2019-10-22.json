    "abstract": "Opposite neurons, found in macaque dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) and ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas, combine visual and vestibular cues of self-motion in opposite ways. A neural circuit recently proposed utilizes opposite neurons to perform causal inference and decide whether the visual and vestibular cues in MSTd and VIP should be integrated or segregated. However, it is unclear how these opposite connections can be formed with biologically realistic learning rules. We propose a network model capable of learning these opposite neurons, using Hebbian and Anti-Hebbian learning rules. The learned neurons are topographically organized and have von Mises-shaped feedforward connections, with tuning properties characteristic of opposite neurons. Our purpose is two-fold: on the one hand, we provide a circuit-level mechanism that explains the properties and formation of opposite neurons; on the other hand, we present a way to extend current theories of multisensory integration to account for appropriate segregation of sensory cues.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning applied to MRI for Alzheimers classification is hypothesized to improve if the deep learning model implicates diseases pathophysiology. The challenge in testing this hypothesis is that large-scale data are required to train this type of model. Here, we overcome this challenge by using a novel data augmentation strategy and show that our MRI-based deep learning model classifies Alzheimers dementia with high accuracy. Moreover, a class activation map was found dominated by signal from the hippocampal formation, a site where Alzheimers pathophysiology begins. Next, we tested the models performance in prodromal Alzheimers when patients present with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We retroactively dichotomized a large cohort of MCI patients who were followed for up to 10 years into those with and without prodromal Alzheimers at baseline and used the dementia-derived model to generate individual  deep learning MRI scores. We compared the two groups on these scores, and on other biomarkers of amyloid pathology, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration. The deep learning MRI scores outperformed nearly all other biomarkers, including--unexpectedly--biomarkers of amyloid or tau pathology, in classifying prodromal disease and in predicting clinical progression. Providing a mechanistic explanation, the deep learning MRI scores were found to be linked to regional tau pathology, through investigations using cross-sectional, longitudinal, premortem and postmortem data. Our findings validate that a diseases known pathophysiology can improve the design and performance of deep learning models. Moreover, by showing that deep learning can extract useful biomarker information from conventional MRIs, the advantages of this model extend practically, potentially reducing patient burden, risk, and cost.",

    "abstract": "Sensory stimuli are represented by the joint activity of large populations of neurons across the mammalian cortex. Information in such responses is limited by trial-to-trial variability. Because that variability is not independent between neurons, it has the potential to improve or degrade the amount of sensory information in the population response. How visual information scales with population size remains an open empirical question. Here, we use Neuropixels to simultaneously record tens to hundreds of single neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of mice and estimate population information. We found a mix of synergistic and redundant coding: synergy predominated in small populations (2-12 cells) before giving way to redundancy. The shared variability of this coding regime included global shared spike count variability at longer timescales, layer specific shared spike count variability at finer timescales, and shared variability in spike timing (jitter) that linked ensembles that span layers. Such ensembles defined by their shared variability carry more information. Our results suggest fine time scale stimulus encoding may be distributed across physically overlapping but distinct ensembles in V1.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) are widely studied using liquid biopsy methods that analyze single, fractionally-small peripheral blood (PB) samples. However, little is known about fluctuations in CTC numbers that occur over short timescales in vivo, and how these may affect accurate enumeration from blood samples.\n\nMethodsWe recently developed an instrument called  diffuse in vivo flow cytometry (DiFC) that allows continuous, non-invasive counting of rare, green fluorescent protein expressing CTCs in large deeply-seated blood vessels in mice. Here, we used DiFC to study short-term changes in CTC numbers in multiple myeloma and Lewis lung carcinoma xenograft models. We analyzed 35- to 50-minute data sets, with intervals corresponding to approximately 1, 5, 10 and 20% of the PB volume, as well as changes over 24-hour periods.\n\nResultsFor rare CTCs, the use of short DiFC intervals (corresponding to small PB samples) frequently resulted in no detections. For more abundant CTCs, CTC numbers frequently varied by an order of magnitude or more over the time-scales considered. This variability far exceeded that expected by Poisson statistics, and instead was consistent with rapidly changing mean numbers of CTCs in the PB.\n\nConclusionsBecause of these natural temporal changes, accurately enumerating CTCs from fractionally small blood samples is inherently problematic. The problem is likely to be compounded for multicellular CTC clusters or specific CTC subtypes. However, we also show that enumeration can be improved by averaging multiple samples, analysis of larger volumes, or development of new methods for enumeration of CTCs directly in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year survival of less than 5%. Transcriptomic analysis has identified two clinically relevant molecular subtypes of PDAC: Classical and Basal-like. The Classical subtype is characterized by a more favorable prognosis and better response to chemotherapy than the Basal-like subtype. The Classical subtype also expresses higher levels of lineage specifiers that regulate endodermal differentiation, including the nuclear receptor HNF4. Using in vitro and in vivo PDAC models, we show that HNF4 restrains tumor growth and drives tumor cells toward an epithelial identity. Gene expression analysis from murine models and human tumors shows that HNF4 activates expression of genes associated with the Classical subtype. Although HNF4 loss is not sufficient for complete conversion to the Basal-like subtype gene expression profile, HNF4 directly represses SIX4 and SIX1, mesodermal lineage specifiers expressed in the Basal-like subtype. Finally, HNF4-negative PDAC cells rely on expression of SIX4 and SIX1 for proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our data show that HNF4 regulates the growth and molecular subtype of PDAC by multiple mechanisms, including activation of the Classical gene expression program and repression of SIX4 and SIX1, which may represent novel dependencies of the Basal-like subtype.",

The occurrence of one type of cancer over another varies from animals to human individuals. Further, clinical data suggest that specific cancer types such as mammary and colorectal cancer are rare in ruminant like goat.\\n\\nMethodsFresh urine samples were collected from healthy ruminates including cow, goat, buffalo, ox, horse, jenny and human and subjected to fractionation using drying, vortexing, centrifugation and sterile filtration in DMSO solvent. Collected urine DMSO fraction (UDF) samples from all sources were subjected DNA metabolizing assay with plasmid DNA pBR322 and genomic DNA of MCF-7 cells. Further, based on the discernible DNA metabolizing effects, goat UDF was tested for anti-proliferative effects upon HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells using Trypan blue due exclusion assay.\\n\\nResultsThis paper reports that goat UDF possesses very clear DNA metabolizing effects (up to 95%) upon plasmid and genomic DNA compared to other ruminants and human UDF samples. Interestingly autoclaving of goat UDF and other sample results in the significant loss of DNA metabolizing effects. In this way, data potentially indicate that the goat UDF sample contains metabolite or similar organic compounds. Further, in vitro treatment of the goat UDF sample shows discernible anti-proliferative effects upon HCT-116 (up to 75%) and MCF-7 (up to 40%).\\n\\nConclusionThis study signifies the clear differences in DNA metabolizing effects of goat UDF and well correlated with anti-proliferative effects upon HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells.

    "abstract": "Nitrogen deposition (Ndep) is considered a significant threat to plant diversity in grassland ecosystems around the world. The evidence supporting this conclusion comes from both observational and experimental research, with \"space-for-time\" substitution surveys of pollutant gradients a significant portion of the former. However, estimates of regression coefficients for Ndep impacts on species richness, derived with a focus on causal inference, are hard to locate in the observational literature. Some influential observational studies have presented estimates from univariate models, overlooking the effects of omitted variable bias, and/or have used P-value-based stepwise variable selection (PSVS) to infer impacts, a strategy known to be poorly suited to the accurate estimation of regression coefficients. Broad-scale spatial autocorrelation has also generally been unaccounted for. We re-examine two UK observational datasets that have previously been used to investigate the relationship between Ndep and plant species richness in acid grasslands, a much-researched habitat in this context. One of these studies (Stevens et al. 2004, Science, 303:1876-1879) estimated a large negative impact of Ndep on richness through the use of PSVS; the other reported smaller impacts (Maskell et al. 2010, Glob. Change Biol., 16:671-679), but did not explicitly report regression coefficients or partial effects, making the actual size of the estimated Ndep impact difficult to assess. We reanalyse both datasets using a spatial Bayesian linear model estimated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). Contrary to previous results, we found similar-sized estimates of the Ndep impact on plant richness between studies, both with and without bryophytes, albeit with some disagreement over the most likely direction of this effect. Our analyses suggest that some previous estimates of Ndep impacts on richness from space-for-time substitution studies are likely to have been over-estimated, and that the evidence from observational studies could be fragile when confronted with alternative model specifications, although further work is required to investigate potentially nonlinear responses. Given the growing literature on the use of observational data to estimate the impacts of pollutants on biodiversity, we suggest that a greater focus on clearly reporting important outcomes with associated uncertainty, the use of techniques to account for spatial autocorrelation, and a clearer focus on the aims of a study, whether explanatory or predictive, are all required.",

    "abstract": "Certain therapies (i.e. daclizumab) that promote expansion of natural killer (NK) cells are associated with clinical amelioration of disease in the context of multiple sclerosis and associated mouse models. The clinical benefits are putatively attributable to an enhanced capacity of NK cells to kill activated pathogenic T cells. Whether a parallel approach will also be effective in systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a multi-organ autoimmune disease driven by aberrant responses of self-reactive T and B cells, is unclear. In the present study we assess the therapeutic impact of IL-2 and IL-15-based strategies for expanding NK cells on measures of lupus-like disease in a mouse model. Unexpectedly, cytokine-mediated expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes aggravated immunological measures of lupus-like disease. Depletion studies reveal that the negative effects of these cytokine-based regimens can largely be attributed to expansion of CD8 T cells rather than NK cells. These results provoke caution in the use of cytokine-based therapeutics to treat co-morbid cancers in patients with lupus and highlight the need for new methods to selectively expand NK cells in order to further assess their clinical value in autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs the individual ages, the immune system decreases in activity while chronic systemic inflammation increases. The microbiome is also affected by age, decreasing in beneficial microbes while increasing in pathogenic, inflammation inducing microbes with corresponding changes in their metabolic profile. While aging is known to affect both, links between the two have been hard to uncover.\n\nMethodsFour young (age 3-6 years) and 12 old (age>18 years) Rhesus macaques were recruited for the study. PBMCs and plasma were collected to investigate immune cell subsets by flow cytometry and plasma cytokines by bead based multiplex cytokine analysis respectively. Stool samples were collected by ileal loop for microbiome analysis by shotgun metagenomics and serum, gut microbial lysate and microbe-free fecal extract was used to determine metabolomics by mass-spectrometry.\n\nResultsOur aging NHP model recaptured many of the features of the age-associated immune alterations, with increased inflammation and alterations in immune cells subsets with lower number of CD4 T cells and a trend of age associated alterations in maturation subsets in older animals with lower naive and higher central memory CD4 T cells. Older animals showed a significantly different microbiome from young animals with lower abundance of Firmicutes and higher Archaeal and Proteobacterial species. Correlation analysis showed a link between microbes in older animals with systemic inflammation. Analysis of metabolites in the serum and feces showed significant differences between specific metabolites between young and older animals that can influence age-associated morbidities.\n\nConclusionThese data support the age associated alterations in microbiome profile and its association with persistent systemic inflammation and metabolome changes. Further mechanistic studies are needed to understand the relationship between inflammation and microbiome. Nevertheless, this NHP model recapitulates human age associated changes in immune, inflammatory and microbiome profiles and can be useful for designing future studies targeting microbiome modulations in aging.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria that infect the respiratory tract of individuals with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF); in fact, S. aureus has recently overtaken P. aeruginosa to become the most common. Substantial research has been performed on the epidemiology of S. aureus in CF; however, there appears to be a gap in knowledge in regard to the pathogenesis of S. aureus in the context of CF lung infections. Most studies have focused on a few S. aureus isolates, often exclusively laboratory adapted strains, and how they are killed by P. aeruginosa. Because of this, little is known about the diversity of S. aureus CF lung isolates in both virulence and interaction with P. aeruginosa. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, we recently sequenced 65 clinical S. aureus isolates from the Emory CF Biospecimen Registry and Boston Childrens Hospital, including the reference isolate JE2, a USA300 strain. Here, we analyzed antibiotic resistance genotypes, sequence type, clonal complex, spa type, and agr type of these isolates. We hypothesized that major virulence phenotypes of S. aureus that may be associated with CF lung infections, namely toxin production and mucoid phenotype, would be retained in these isolates. To test our hypothesis, we plated on specific agars and found that most isolates can hemolyze both rabbit and sheep blood (67.7%) and produce polysaccharide (69.2%), consistent with virulence retention in CF lung isolates. We also identified three distinct phenotypic groups of S. aureus based on their survival in the presence of nonmucoid P. aeruginosa laboratory strain PAO1 and its mucoid derivative. Altogether, our work provides greater insight into the diversity of S. aureus CF isolates, specifically the distribution of important virulence factors and their interaction with P. aeruginosa, all of which have implications in patient health.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStaphylococcus aureus is now the most frequently detected pathogen in the lungs of individuals who have cystic fibrosis (CF), followed closely by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When these two pathogens are found to coinfect the CF lung, patients have a significantly worse prognosis. While P. aeruginosa has been rigorously studied in the context of bacterial pathogenesis in CF, less is known about S. aureus. Here we present an in-depth study of 64 S. aureus CF clinical isolates where we investigated genetic diversity utilizing whole genome sequencing, virulence phenotypes, and interactions with P. aeruginosa. We have found that S. aureus isolated from the CF lung are phylogenetically diverse, most retain known virulence factors, and they vary in interactions with P. aeruginosa from highly sensitive to completely tolerant. Deepening our understanding of how S. aureus responds to its environment and other microbes in the CF lung will enable future development of effective treatments and preventative measures against these formidable infections.",

Violacein, a naturally occurring indole pigment with antibiotic properties, can be biosynthetically engineered in Escherichia coli expressing its non-native synthesis pathway. To explore whether this synthetic biosynthesis platform could be used for drug discovery, here we have screened bacterially-derived violacein against the main causative agent of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum. We show the antiparasitic activity of bacterially-derived violacein against the P. falciparum 3D7 laboratory reference strain as well as drug-sensitive and resistant patient isolates, confirming the potential utility of this drug as an antimalarial. We then screen a biosynthetic series of violacein derivatives against P. falciparum growth. The demonstrated varied activity of each derivative against asexual parasite growth points to potential for further development of violacein as an antimalarial. Towards defining its mode of action, we show that biosynthetic violacein affects the parasite actin cytoskeleton, resulting in an accumulation of actin signal that is independent of actin polymerization. This activity points to a target that modulates actin behaviour in the cell either in terms of its regulation or its folding. More broadly, our data show that bacterial synthetic biosynthesis is a suitable platform for antimalarial drug discovery with potential applications in high-throughput and cost-effective drug screening with otherwise chemically-intractable natural products.",

    "abstract": "Genes implicated in bacterial stress responses have been used to construct models that infer the growth outcome of a bacterium in the presence of antibiotics with the objective to develop novel diagnostic methods in the clinic. Current models are trained on data specific to a species or type of stress, making them potentially limited in their application. It is unclear if a generalizable response-signature exists that can predict bacterial fitness independent of strain, species or type of stress. Here we present a substantial RNA-Seq and experimental evolution dataset for 9 strains and species, under multiple antibiotic and non-antibiotic stress conditions. We show that gene panel-based models can accurately predict antibiotic mechanism of action, as well as the fitness outcome of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the presence of antibiotics or under nutrient depletion. However, these models quickly become species-specific as gene homology is limited. Instead, we define a new concept, transcriptomic entropy, which we use to quantify the amount of transcriptional disruption that occurs in a bacterium when responding to the environment. With entropy at the center, we train a suite of predictive (machine learning) models enabling generalizable fitness and antibiotic sensitivity predictions. These entropy-based models that predict bacterial fitness are validated for 7 Gram-positive and -negative species under antibiotic and non-antibiotic conditions indicating that transcriptomic entropy can be used as a generalizable stress signature. Moreover, rather than being a binary indicator of fitness, an entropy-based model was developed and validated to predict the minimum inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic. Lastly, we show that the inclusion of a varied-set of multi-omics features of a bacterial stress response further enhances fitness predictions by reducing ambiguity. By demonstrating the feasibility of generalizable predictions of bacterial fitness, this work establishes the fundamentals for potentially new approaches in infectious disease diagnostics, including antibiotic susceptibility testing.\\n\\nSignificance statementAccurate predictions of bacterial fitness outcome could potentially have clinical diagnostic value, such as predicting optimum antibiotic choice and dosage for treating infectious diseases. Existing models of fitness predictions rely mainly on gene panel approaches, which may be species- and stress-specific due to a lack of gene and response conservation. In order to overcome this limitation, we generated a substantial experimental dataset and identified entropy as a universal stress response signature that quantifies the level of transcriptional disruption that is indicative of fitness outcome under a stressful condition. We present and validate for Gram-positive and negative species a suite of entropy-based models that enable accurate predictions of fitness outcome and the level of antibiotic sensitivity in a species and stress-type independent manner.",

    "abstract": "Organisms are constantly challenged by pathogens and pests which can drive the evolution of growth-defense strategies. Plant stomata are essential for gas-exchange during photosynthesis and conceptually lie at the intersection of the physiological demands of growth and exposure to foliar fungal. Generations of natural selection for locally adapted growth-defense strategies can eliminate variation between traits, potentially masking trade-offs and selection conflicts that may have existed in the past. Hybrid populations offer a unique opportunity to reset the clock on selection and to study potentially maladaptive trait variation before selection removes it. We study the interactions of growth, stomatal, ecopysiological, and disease resistance traits in Poplars (Populus) after infection by the leaf rust Melampsora medusae. Phenotypes were measured in a common garden and genotyped at 227K SNPs. We isolate the effects of hybridization on trait variance, discover correlations between stomatal, ecophysiology and disease resistance, examine trade-offs and selection conflicts, and explore the evolution of growth-defense strategies potentially mediated by selection for stomatal traits on the upper leaf surface. These results suggest an important role for stomata in determining growth-defense strategies in organisms susceptible to foliar pathogens, and reinforces the contribution of hybridization studies towards our understanding of trait evolution.",

    "abstract": "In light of the low signal-to-noise nature of many large biological data sets, we propose a novel method to learn the structure of association networks using Gaussian graphical models combined with prior knowledge. Our strategy includes two parts. In the first part, we propose a model selection criterion called structural Bayesian information criterion (SBIC), in which the prior structure is modeled and incorporated into Bayesian information criterion (BIC). It is shown that the popular extended BIC (EBIC) is a special case of SBIC. In the second part, we propose a two-step algorithm to construct the candidate model pool. The algorithm is data-driven and the prior structure is embedded into the candidate model automatically. Theoretical investigation shows that under some mild conditions SBIC is a consistent model selection criterion for high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model. Simulation studies validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the existing ones and show the robustness to the model misspecification. Application to relative concentration data from infant feces collected from subjects enrolled in a large molecular epidemiological cohort study validates that metabolic pathway involvement is a statistically significant factor for the conditional dependence between metabolites. Furthermore, new relationships among metabolites are discovered which can not be identified by the conventional methods of pathway analysis. Some of them have been widely recognized in biological literature.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific hybridization and allopolyploidization merges evolutionarily distinct parental genomes (subgenomes) into a single nucleus. A frequent observation is that one subgenome is \"dominant\" over the other subgenome, having a greater number of reatined duplicate genes and being more highly expressed. Which subgenome becomes dominantly expressed in allopolyploids remains poorly understood. Here we \"replayed the evolutionary tape\" with six isogenic resynthesized Brassica napus (rapeseed) allopolyploid lines and investigated subgenome dominance patterns over the first ten generations. We found that the same subgenome was consistently more dominantly expressed in all lines and generations. Furthermore, DNA methylation differences between subgenomes mirrored the observed gene expression bias towards the Brassica oleracea derived  C subgenome in all lines and generations. These differences in gene expression and methylation were also found when comparing the progenitor genomes, suggesting subgenome dominance is related to inherited parental genome differences rather than a byproduct of allopolyploidization. Gene network analyses indicated an enrichment for network interactions and several biological functions for  C subgenome biased pairs, but no enrichment was observed for  A subgenome biased pairs. These findings demonstrate that \"replaying the evolutionary tape\" in allopolyploids results in repeatable and predictable subgenome expression dominance patterns based on preexisting genetic differences among the parental species. These findings have major implications regarding the genotypic and phenotypic diversity observed following plant hybridization in both ecological and agricultural contexts.",

    "abstract": "Using CRISPR/Cas9 to simultaneously induce mutations in two or more target genes, commonly referred to as multiplexing, may result in chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions or translocations. While this may be undesirable in some contexts, the ability to recover chromosomal rearrangements targeted to specific sites in the genome is potentially a powerful tool. Before developing such tools, however, it is first important to measure the frequency with which chromosome rearrangements are induced by CRISPR/Cas9 multiplexing. To do this, we have developed a self-selecting screening system using a Drosophila line that carries an autosomal pericentric inversion in what is known as the autosynaptic form. All progeny of normal females crossed to males of this autosynaptic stock are lethal due to excessive aneuploidy. If an inversion is induced within the female germline, and if it is analogous to the inversion in the male autosynaptic line, then it is possible to recover progeny in which aneuploidy is reduced and viability is restored. Using this self-selection method, we screened 130 females and recovered one new autosynaptic element. Salivary gland polytene chromosome analysis, PCR, and sequencing confirmed the recovery of a breakpoint induced precisely between the two sgRNA target sites. Overall, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 multiplexing can induce chromosomal rearrangements in Drosophila. Also, in using this particular system, the recovery of chromosomal rearrangements was not a high frequency event.",

    "abstract": "Activation of type 1 interferon response is extensively connected with the antiviral immunity and pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Here, we found that IRGM, whose deficiency is linked with the genesis of several autoimmune disorders, is a master negative regulator of the interferon response. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with nucleic acid sensor proteins, including cGAS and RIG-I, and mediates their autophagic degradation to restrain activation of interferon signaling. Further, IRGM maintains mitophagy flux, and its deficiency results in the accumulation of defunct leaky mitochondria that releases cytosolic DAMPs triggering activation of interferon responses via cGAS-STING and RIG-I-MAVS signaling axis. Due to an enduring type 1 IFN response in IRGM-deficient cells and mice, they were intrinsically resistant to infection of the Japanese Encephalitis virus, Herpes Simplex virus, and Chikungunya virus. Altogether, this study defines the molecular mechanisms by which IRGM maintains interferon homeostasis and protects from autoimmune diseases. Further, it identifies IRGM as a broad therapeutic target for defense against viruses.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/815506v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (48K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4822org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6aebbcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19a9b72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1539195_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The widespread bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) regulates a variety of processes, including protein secretion, motility, cell development, and biofilm formation. C-di-GMP-dependent responses are often mediated by its binding to the cytoplasmic receptors that contain the PilZ domain. We present here comparative structural and sequence analysis of various PilZ-related domains and describe three principal types of them: (i) the canonical PilZ domain, whose structure includes a six-stranded beta-barrel and a C-terminal alpha-helix; (ii) an atypical PilZ domain that contains two extra alpha-helices and forms stable tetramers, and (iii) divergent PilZ-related domains, which include the eponymous PilZ protein and PilZN (YcgR_N) and PilZNR (YcgR_2) domains. We refine the second c-di-GMP binding motif of PilZ as [D/N]hSxxG and show that the hydrophobic residue h of this motif interacts with a cluster of conserved hydrophobic residues, helping maintain the PilZ domain fold. We describe several novel PilZN-type domains that are fused to the canonical PilZ domains in specific taxa, such as spirochetes, actinobacteria, cellulosolytic clostridia, deltaproteobacteria, and aquificae. We propose that the evolution of three major groups of PilZ domains included (i) fusion of pilZ with other genes, which produced Alg44, cellulose synthase, and other multidomain proteins; (ii) insertion of a [~]200-bp fragment, which resulted in the formation of tetramer-forming PilZ proteins, and (iii) tandem duplication of pilZ genes, which led to the formation of PilZ dimers and YcgR-like proteins.\\n\\nIMPORTANCECyclic di-GMP is a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates motility, biofilm formation and virulence of many bacterial pathogens. The PilZ domain is a widespread c-di-GMP receptor that binds c-di-GMP through its RxxxR and [D/N]xSxxG motifs; some PilZ domains lack these motifs and are unable to bind c-di-GMP. We used structural and sequence analysis to assess the diversity of PilZ-related domains and define their common features. We show that the hydrophobic residue h in the second motif is highly conserved; it may serve as a readout for c-di-GMP binding. We describe three principal classes of PilZ-related domains: canonical, tetramer-forming, and divergent PilZ domains, and propose the evolutionary pathways that led to the emergence of these PilZ types.",

    "abstract": "While the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood, little is known about the post-fusion events that precede RNA replication, such as nucleocapsid disassembly. We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFV{Delta}SK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFV{Delta}SK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E expression; however, as expected, gene expression from the defective reporter virus was insensitive to a small molecule inhibitor of YFV RNA replication. YFV{Delta}SK/Nluc gene expression was also shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur, as well as valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large macromolecular complexes. RNA transfection and washout experiments showed that VCP/p97 functions at a post-fusion, pre-translation step in YFV entry. Together, these data support a critical role for VCP/p97 in the disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a post-fusion step in virus entry.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEFlaviviruses are an important group of RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. The mechanisms by which flavivirus nucleocapsids are disassembled during virus entry remain unclear.

    "abstract": "Salient auditory stimuli typically exhibit rhythmic temporal patterns. A growing body of evidence suggests that, in primary auditory cortex (A1), attention is associated with entrainment of delta rhythms (1 - 4 Hz) by these auditory stimuli. It is thought that this entrainment involves phase reset of ongoing spontaneous oscillations in A1 by thalamus matrix afferents, but precise mechanisms are unknown. Furthermore, naturalistic stimuli can vary widely in terms of their rhythmicity: some cycles can be longer than others and frequency can drift over time. It is not clear how the auditory system accommodates this natural variability. We show that in rhesus macaque monkey A1 in vivo, bottom-up gamma (40 Hz) click trains influence ongoing spontaneous delta rhythms by inducing an initial delta-timescale transient response, followed by entrainment to gamma and suppression of delta. We then construct a computational model to reproduce this effect, showing that transient thalamus matrix activation can reset A1 delta oscillations by directly activating deep (layer 5) IB cells, promoting bursting, and beginning a new delta cycle. In contrast, long duration gamma-rhythmic input stimuli induce a steady-state containing entrainment of superficial RS and FS cells at gamma, and suppression of delta oscillations. This suppression is achieved in the model by two complementary pathways. First, long-duration thalamus matrix input causes IB cells to switch from bursting to sparse firing, which disrupts the IB bursts associated with delta. Second, thalamus core input activates deep FS cells (by way of layer 4), which fire at gamma frequency and actively inhibit the delta oscillator. Together, these two fundamental operations of reset and suppression can respectively advance and delay the phase of the delta oscillator, allowing it to follow rhythms exhibiting the type of variability found in the natural environment. We discuss these findings in relation to functional implications for speech processing.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeurons organize their firing into synchronous, rhythmic patterns. These neural oscillations have been shown to entrain to rhythmic stimuli in the external world, such as patterns of speech or patterns of movement. By entraining to a particular input stimulus, these oscillations are thought to help us attend to that stimulus and to exclude others. To understand how this synchronization emerges, we constructed a physiologically detailed mathematical model of the primary auditory cortex. By fitting this model to a variety of experimental data, we suggest fundamental mechanisms by which neurons of the auditory cortex can synchronize their activity to rhythmic external stimuli. This result will be useful for understanding the mechanism and limitations of oscillatory entrainment, which are thought to underlie the processing of naturalistic auditory inputs like speech or music. Furthermore, this model, though simplified, was shown to generalize and reproduce a wide range of experimental results, and can thus be used as a starting point for building more complex models of auditory cortex.",

Participants performed foveal and parafoveal face and house discrimination tasks for upright or inverted stimuli ([&le;] 4{degrees}) while their eye movements were monitored. Low-level visual tasks were also measured. The eccentricity-related accuracy reductions were evident for all categories. Through detailed analyses we found (i) a robust face inversion effect across the parafovea, while for houses an opposite effect was found, (ii) higher eccentricity-related sensitivity for face performance than for house performance (via inverted vs. upright within-category eccentricity-driven reductions), (iii) within-category but not across-category performance associations across eccentricities, and (iv) no hemifield biases.

    "abstract": "The axonal projections of the adrenergic system to the neocortex, originating from the locus coeruleus (LC), form a dense network. These axons release the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) which is involved in many cognitive functions such as attention, arousal, and working memory. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging of NE axons in the cortex of awake mice, we investigated what drives their phasic activity. We discovered that NE axons in the primary somatosensory cortex responded robustly and reliably to somatosensory stimulation. Surprisingly, the same axons also responded to stimuli of other modalities (auditory and visual). Similar responses to all three modalities were observed in the primary visual cortex as well. These results indicate that phasic responses of NE axons to sensory stimuli provide a robust multimodal signal. However, despite the robustness, we also noticed consistent variations in the data. For example, responses to whisker stimulations were larger than to auditory and visual stimulations in both the barrel and the visual cortices. To test whether the variations in NE axonal responses can carry behaviorally meaningful information, we trained mice in an associative auditory fear conditioning paradigm. We found that following conditioning the response of NE axons increased only for CS+, namely the signal undergoes experience-dependent plasticity and is specific to meaningful sounds. To test if variations in NE axonal responses can differentially affect the cortical microcircuit, we used dual-color two-photon Ca2+ imaging and studied the relationship between the activity of NE axons and local dendrites. We found dendritic Ca2+ signals in barrel cortex in response to auditory stimuli, but these responses were variable and unreliable. Strikingly, the probability of such dendritic signals increased nonlinearly with the Ca2+ signals of NE axons. Our results demonstrate that the phasic activity of the noradrenergic neurons may serve as a robust multimodal and plastic signal in sensory cortices. Furthermore, the variations in the NE axonal activity carry behaviorally meaningful signals and can predict the probability of local dendritic Ca2+ events.",

    "abstract": "Elevated hearing thresholds in hearing impaired adults are usually compensated by providing amplification through a hearing aid. In spite of restoring hearing sensitivity, difficulties with understanding speech in noisy environments often remain. One main reason is that sensorineural hearing loss not only causes loss of audibility but also other deficits, including peripheral distortion but also central temporal processing deficits. To investigate the neural consequences of hearing impairment in the brain underlying speech-in-noise difficulties, we compared EEG responses to natural speech of 14 hearing impaired adults with those of 14 age-matched normal-hearing adults. We measured neural envelope tracking to sentences and a story masked by different levels of a stationary noise or competing talker. Despite their sensorineural hearing loss, hearing impaired adults showed higher neural envelope tracking of the target than the competing talker, similar to their normal-hearing peers. Furthermore, hearing impairment was related to an additional increase in neural envelope tracking of the target talker, suggesting that hearing impaired adults may have an enhanced sensitivity to envelope modulations or require a larger differential tracking of target versus competing talker to neurally segregate speech from noise. Lastly, both normal-hearing and hearing impaired participants showed an increase in neural envelope tracking with increasing speech understanding. Hence, our results open avenues towards new clinical applications, such as neuro-steered prostheses as well as objective and automatic measurements of speech understanding performance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAdults with hearing impairment can neurally segregate speech from background noise\nC_LIO_LIHearing loss is related to enhanced neural envelope tracking of the target talker\nC_LIO_LINeural envelope tracking has potential to objectively measure speech understanding\nC_LI",

While ataxic gait and its treatment-induced improvements can be captured in laboratory-based assessments, quantitative markers of ataxic gait in real life will help to determine ecologically meaningful improvements.\\n\\nOBJECTIVESTo unravel and validate markers of ataxic gait in real life by using wearable sensors.\\n\\nMETHODSWe assessed gait characteristics of 43 patients with degenerative cerebellar disease (SARA:9.4{+/-}3.9) compared to 35 controls by 3 body-worn inertial sensors in three conditions: (1) laboratory-based walking; (2) supervised free walking; (3) real-life walking during everyday living (subgroup n=21). Movement analysis focussed on measures of movement smoothness and spatio-temporal step variability.\\n\\nRESULTSA set of gait variability measures was identified which allowed to consistently identify ataxic gait changes in all three conditions. Lateral step deviation and a compound measure of step length categorized patients against controls in real life with a discrimination accuracy of 0.86. Both were highly correlated with clinical ataxia severity (effect size {rho}=0.76). These measures allowed detecting group differences even for patients who differed only 1 point in the SARAp&g subscore, with highest effect sizes for real-life walking (d=0.67).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWe identified measures of ataxic gait that allowed not only to capture the gait variability inherent in ataxic gait in real life, but also demonstrate high sensitivity to small differences in disease severity - with highest effect sizes in real-life walking. They thus represent promising candidates for quantitative motor markers for natural history and treatment trials in ecologically valid contexts.",

However, interpreting the one-dimensional scattering profiles in terms of three-dimensional structures and ensembles remains challenging, partly because it is poorly understood how structural information is encoded along the measured scattering angle. We combined all-atom SAXS-restrained ensemble simulations, simplified continuum models, and SAXS experiments of a n-dodecyl-{beta}-D-maltoside (DDM) micelle to decipher the effects of model asymmetry, shape fluctuations, atomic disorder, and atomic details on SAXS curves. Upon interpreting the small-angle regime, we find remarkable agreement between (i) a two-component tri-axial ellipsoid model fitted against the data with (ii) a SAXS-refined all-atom ensemble. However, continuum models fail at wider angles, even if they account for shape fluctuations, disorder, and asymmetry of the micelle. We conclude that modelling atomic details is mandatory for explaining SAXS curves at wider angles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious phylogeographic studies of the lion (Panthera leo) have improved our insight into the distribution of genetic variation, as well as a revised taxonomy which now recognizes a northern (Panthera leo leo) and a southern (Panthera leo melanochaita) subspecies. However, existing whole range phylogeographic studies on lions either consist of very limited numbers of samples, or are focused on mitochondrial DNA and/or a limited set of microsatellites. The geographic extent of genetic lineages and their phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain, clouded by massive sampling gaps, sex-biased dispersal and incomplete lineage sorting.\n\nResultsIn this study we present results of low depth whole genome sequencing and subsequent variant calling in ten lions sampled throughout the geographic range, resulting in the discovery of >150,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Phylogenetic analyses revealed the same basal split between northern and southern populations as well as four population clusters on a more local scale. Further, we designed a SNP panel, including 125 autosomal and 14 mitochondrial SNPs, which was tested on >200 lions from across their range. Results allow us to assign individuals to one of these four major clades (West & Central Africa, India, East Africa, or Southern Africa) and delineate these clades in more detail.\n\nConclusionsThe results presented here, particularly the validated SNP panel, have important applications, not only for studying populations on a local geographic scale, but also for tracing samples of unknown origin for forensic purposes, and for guiding conservation management of ex situ populations. Thus, these genomic resources not only contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history of the lion, but may also play a crucial role in conservation efforts aimed at protecting the species in its full diversity.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTaxonomic analysis of microbiomes based on 16S rRNA amplicons has so far been usually restricted to abundance analysis of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are usually mapped to genus, as the furthest level for a balance between accuracy and speed. Biodiversity within taxa has been little studied, due to lack of proper computational tools. Within-taxon diversity reflects genetic polymorphism within the taxa to reveal whether there are potentially more variants/lineages for some microbiome-associated traits, e.g., diseases or bioconversion efficiency. The diversity will aid diagnosis decisions.\\n\\nResultsHere we introduce a tool, WITOD, for the WIthin-Taxon Operational taxonomic unit Diversity analysis. WITOD works on the alignment of all the OTU sequences within a taxon to get a non-redundant alignment with consensus regions on both ends (due to the conservation of the 16S regions used). Then the relative abundance of identical OTUs is combined; more specific taxonomy is obtained through BLASTn of these OTU sequences against the Silva database. One of the outputs is an OTU table with these unique OTUs with new taxonomy, combined relative abundance. In addition, another table can be constructed which we call the diversity table that associates the number of OTUs for a specific Taxa and the relative abundance in that environment. This can be used to further discover the importance of differing diversity in a given environment.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this paper, we have introduced a python program WITOD which is a computational tool to analyze the within-taxon biodiversity of microbiome composition. It will be useful in revealing the genetic polymorphism in general and aiding identifying the causative human pathogens or environmental disease vectors.

We demonstrate, by qRT-PCR analysis on individual and pooled CFCs, that leukemic clonogenic progenitor expansion in the peripheral blood represents the first cellular event before any evidence of cytological change.

It is known that the composition of the microbiome and bacterial species abundances can have a major impact on host health and Darwinian fitness, but the processes that lead to these microbial patterns have not yet been identified. We here apply the niche concept and trait-based approaches as a first step in understanding the patterns underlying microbial community assembly and structure in the simple metaorganism Hydra. We find that the carrying capacities in single associations do not reflect microbiota densities as part of the community, indicating a discrepancy between the fundamental and realized niche. Whereas in most cases, the realized niche is smaller than the fundamental one, as predicted by theory, the opposite is observed for Hydra\u2019s two main bacterial colonizers. Both, Curvibacter sp. and Duganella sp. benefit from association with the other members of the microbiome and reach higher fractions as compared to when they are the only colonizer. This cannot be linked to any particular trait that is relevant for interacting with the host or by the utilization of specific nutrients but is most likely determined by metabolic interactions between the individual microbiome members.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePsychotic symptoms are an important feature of severe neuropsychiatric disorders, but are also common in the general population, especially in youth. The genetic etiology of psychosis symptoms in youth remains poorly understood. To characterize genetic risk for psychosis spectrum symptoms (PS), we leverage a community-based multi-ethnic sample of children and adolescents aged 8-22 years, the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n = 7,225, 20% PS).\\n\\nMethodsUsing an elastic net regression model, we aim to classify PS status using polygenic scores (PGS) based on a range of heritable psychiatric and brain-related traits in a multi-PGS model. We also perform univariate PGS associations and evaluate age-specific effects.\\n\\nResultsThe multi-PGS analyses do not improve prediction of PS status over univariate models, but reveal that the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) PGS is robustly and uniquely associated with PS (OR 1.12 (1.05, 1.18) P = 0.0003). This association is: i) driven by subjects of European ancestry (OR=1.23 (1.14, 1.34), P=4.15x10-7) but is not observed in African American subjects (P=0.65) and ii) independent of phenotypic overlap. We also find a significant interaction with age (P=0.01), with a stronger association in younger children. In an independent sample, we replicate an increased ADHD PGS in 328 youth at clinical high risk for psychosis, compared to 216 unaffected controls (OR 1.06, CI(1.01, 1.11), P= 0.02).\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that PS in youth may reflect a different genetic etiology than psychotic symptoms in adulthood, one more akin to ADHD, and shed light on how genetic risk can be investigated across early disease trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Different fish species employ a conditional approach strategy during predator inspection; the risk of approaching a predator is distributed across all inspectors, but is not shared with the animals which keep its distance. Zebrafish, a highly social fish, is increasingly being used in behavioural neuroscience, but it is not known whether it displays conditional approach. In the predator inspection task, animals are observed in a tank with a refuge in one extremity, and an animated image of a predator in the other extremity, with a mirror positioned in parallel to the tank, simulating a perfectly reciprocating conspecific. In Experiment 1, animals spent more time in an inspection zone when the image was turned on, but also displayed more erratic swimming, suggesting cooperation under fear. In Experiment 2, animals spent more time inspecting predators when the mirror was parallel to the tank (\"cooperating mirror\") than when the mirror was in an angle (\"defecting mirror\"), suggesting retaliatory behaviour; in both conditions, animals displayed more freezing and erratic swimming. In Experiment 3, no changes in behaviour were observed, regardless of mirror position, when the image was turned off, suggesting that the choice of specific zones in Experiment 2 was not due to shoaling tendencies. These results suggest that predator inspection is associated with conditional approach, while at the same time inducing fear-like behaviour in the animal.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe extracellular matrix (ECM) initiates mechanical cues and transduces intracellular signaling through matrix-cell interactions. In the blood vessels, additional mechanical cues derived from the pulsatile blood flow and pressure play a pivotal role in homeostasis and disease development. Currently, the nature of the cues from ECM and how they coordinate with a mechanical microenvironment in large blood vessels to maintain the integrity of the vessel wall are not fully understood.\\n\\nObjectiveThe aim of this study was to elucidate the crucial mediator(s) and molecular signaling pathway(s) involved in matrix mechanotransduction during remodeling of the vessel wall.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe performed secretome analysis using rat vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) under cyclic stretch and examined matrix-cell interactions and cell behavior. We found that the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1) was secreted upon cyclic stretch and bound to integrin v{beta}1, thereby recruiting vinculin and establishing focal adhesions. RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that deletion of Thbs1 in vitro markedly affected the target gene expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP). Consistently, we found that Thbs1 promotes nuclear shuttling of YAP in response to cyclic stretch, which depends on the small GTPase Rap2 and Hippo pathway, and is not influenced by alteration of actin fibers. Deletion of Thbs1 in mice inhibited Thbs1/integrin/YAP signaling, leading to maladaptive remodeling of the aorta in response to pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), whereas it suppressed neointima formation upon carotid artery ligation, exerting context-dependent effects on the vessel wall.\\n\\nConclusionsThbs1 serves as a mechanical stress-triggered extracellular mediator of mechanotransduction that acts via integrin v{beta}1 to establish focal adhesions and promotes nuclear shuttling of YAP. We thus propose a novel mechanism of matrix mechanotransduction centered on Thbs1, connecting mechanical stimuli to YAP signaling during vascular remodeling in vivo.\\n\\nSubject codesO_LIVascular Disease\\nC_LIO_LIGenetically Altered and Transgenic Models\\nC_LIO_LIVascular Biology\\nC_LIO_LICell Signaling/Signal Transduction\\nC_LI",

Our previous works found that SA could delay methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced leaf senescence in a concentration-dependent manner. Here, the effect of low concentration of SA (LCSA) application on MeJA-induced leaf senescence was further assessed. High-throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq) results showed that LCSA did not have dominant effects on the genetic regulatory pathways of basal metabolism like nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis and glycolysis. The ClusterONE was applied to identify discrete gene modules based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Interestingly, an autophagy-related (ATG) module was identified in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that exclusively induced by MeJA together with LCSA. RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression of most of the determined ATG genes were upregulated by LCSA. Remarkably, in contrast to wild type (Col-0), LCSA cannot alleviate the leaf yellowing phenotype in autophagy defective mutants (atg5-1 and atg7-2) upon MeJA treatment. Confocal and western blot results showed that LCSA increased the number of autophagic bodies and autophagic flux during MeJA-induced leaf senescence.

    "abstract": "miR-375 is a highly abundant miRNA in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), in other cancers it acts either as a tumor suppressor or oncogene. While free-circulating miR-375 serves as surrogate marker for tumor burden in patients with advanced MCC, its function within MCC cells has not been established. Nearly complete miR-375 knockdown in MCC cell lines was achieved using antagomiRs via nucleofection. Neither cell viability, growth characteristics nor morphology were altered by this knockdown. miR-375 target genes and related signaling pathways were determined using ENCORI revealing Hippo signaling and EMT-related genes likely to be regulated. Thus, their expression was analyzed by multiplexed qRT-PCR after miR-375 knockdown demonstrating only a limited change in expression. In summary, highly effective miR-375 knockdown in classical MCC cell lines did neither significantly change cell viability, morphology, nor oncogenic signaling pathways. These observations render miR-375 an unlikely intracellular oncogene in MCC cells, thus suggesting to address likely functions of miR-375 for intercellular communication of MCC.",

    "abstract": "Slow developing complex diseases are a clinical diagnostic challenge. Since genetic information is increasingly available prior to a patients first visit to a clinic, it might improve diagnostic accuracy. We aimed to devise a method to convert genetic information into simple probabilities discriminating between multiple diagnoses in patients presenting with inflammatory arthritis.\\n\\nWe developed G-Prob, which calculates for each patient the genetic probability for each of multiple possible diseases. We tested this for inflammatory arthritis-causing diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis and gout). After validating in simulated data, we tested G-Prob in biobank cohorts in which genetic data were linked to electronic medical records: - 1,200 patients identified by ICD-codes within the eMERGE database (n= 52,623);\\n- 245 patients identified through ICD codes and review of medical records within the Partners Biobank (n=12,604);\\n- 243 patients selected prospectively with final diagnoses by medical record review within the Partners Biobank (n=12,604).\\nThe calibration of G-Prob with the disease status was high (with regression coefficients ranging from 0.90-1.08 (ideal would be 1.00) in all cohorts. G-Probs discriminative ability was high in all cohorts with pooled Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.69 [95%CI 0.67-0.71], 0.81 [95%CI 0.76-0.84] and 0.84 [95%CI 0.81-0.86]. For all patients, at least one disease could be ruled out, and in 45% of patients a most likely diagnosis could be identified with an overall 64% positive predictive value. In 35% of instances the clinicians initial diagnosis was incorrect. Initial clinical diagnosis explained 39% of the variance in final disease prediction which improved to 51% (P<0.0001) by adding G-Prob genetic data.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by converting genotypes into an interpretable probability value for five different inflammatory arthritides, we can better discriminate and diagnose rheumatic diseases. Genotypes available prior to a clinical visit could be considered part of patients medical history and potentially used to improve precision and diagnostic efficiency in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Proteobacteria constitute the most diverse and abundant group of microbes on Earth. In productive marine environments like deep-sea hydrothermal systems, Proteobacteria have been implicated in autotrophy coupled to sulfur, methane, and hydrogen oxidation, sulfate reduction, and denitrification. Beyond chemoautotrophy, little is known about the ecological significance of novel Proteobacteria that are globally distributed and active in hydrothermal systems. Here we apply multi-omics to characterize 51 metagenome-assembled genomes from three hydrothermal vent plumes in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans that are affiliated with nine novel Proteobacteria lineages. Metabolic analyses revealed these organisms to contain a diverse functional repertoire including chemolithotrophic ability to utilize sulfur and C1 compounds, and chemoorganotrophic ability to utilize environment-derived fatty acids, aromatics, carbohydrates, and peptides. Comparative genomics with marine and terrestrial microbiomes suggests that lineage-associated functional traits could explain niche specificity. Our results shed light on the ecological functions and metabolic strategies of novel Proteobacteria in hydrothermal systems and beyond, and highlight the relationship between genome diversification and environmental adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The traditional brain mapping approach has greatly advanced our understanding of the localized effect of the brain on behavior. However, the statistically significant brain regions identified by standard mass univariate models only explain minimal variance in behavior despite increased sample sizes and statistical power. This is potentially due to the generalizable explanatory signal in the brain being non-sparse, therefore not captured by the thresholded, localized model. Here we introduced the Bayesian polyvertex score (PVS-B), a whole-brain prediction framework that aggregates the effect sizes across all vertices to predict individual variability in behavior. The PVS-B estimates the posterior mean effect size at each vertex with mass univariate summary statistics and the correlation structure of the imaging phenotype, and weights the imaging phenotype of participants from an independent sample with these posterior mean effect sizes to estimate the generalizable effect of a brain-behavior association. Empirical data showed that the PVS-B was able to double the variance explained in general cognitive ability by an n-back fMRI contrast when compared to prediction models based on the mass univariate parameter estimates as well as models in which only vertices thresholded based on p-value were included. A fivefold improvement in variance explained by the PVS-B was observed using a stop signal task fMRI contrast to predict individual variability in the stop signal reaction time. We believe that the PVS-B can shed light on the multivariate investigation of brain-behavioral associations and will empower small scale neuroimaging studies with more reliable and accurate effect size estimates.",

    "abstract": "Members of the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, suggesting their dysregulation plays a critical role. The synthetic lethality between SWI/SNF catalytic subunits BRM/SMARCA2 and BRG1/SMARCA4 has instigated great interest in targeting BRM. Here we have performed a critical and in-depth investigation of novel dual inhibitors (BRM011 and BRM014) of BRM and BRG1 in order to validate their utility as chemical probes of SWI/SNF catalytic function, while obtaining insights into the therapeutic potential of SWI/SNF inhibition. In corroboration of on-target activity, we discovered compound resistant mutations through pooled screening of BRM variants in BRG1-mut cancer cells. Strikingly, genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin profiling (ATAC-Seq) provided further evidence of pharmacological perturbation of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling as BRM011 treatment induced specific changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression similar to genetic depletion of BRM. Finally, these compounds have the capacity to inhibit the growth of tumor-xenografts, yielding important insights into the feasibility of developing BRM/BRG1 ATPase inhibitors for the treatment of BRG1-mut lung cancers. Overall, our studies not only establish the feasibility of inhibiting SWI/SNF catalytic function, providing a framework for SWI/SNF therapeutic targeting, but have also yielded successful elucidation of small-molecule inhibitors that will be of importance in probing SWI/SNF function in various disease contexts.",

    "abstract": "Micro-structured surfaces provide a unique framework to probe cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics in a standardized manner. Here, we report on the steady-state occupancy probability of cells in asymmetric two-state microstructures that consist of two fibronectin-coated adhesion sites connected by a thin guidance cue. In these dumbbell-like structures, cells transition between the two sites in a repeated and stochastic manner and average dwell times in the respective microenvironments are determined from the cell trajectories. We study the dynamics of human breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) in these microstructures as a function of area, shape and orientation of the adhesion sites. On square adhesive sites with different areas, we find that the occupancy probability ratio is directly proportional to the ratio of corresponding adhesion site areas. Sites of equal area but different shape lead to equal occupancy, if shapes are isotropic, e.g. squared or circular. In contrast, an asymmetry in the occupancy is induced by anisotropic shapes like rhombi, triangles or rectangles that enable motion in the direction perpendicular to the transition axis. Analysis of the 2D motion of cells between two rectangles with orthogonal orientation suggests that cellular transition rates depend on the cell polarisation induced by anisotropic micropatterns. Taken together, our results illustrate how two-state-micropatterns provide a dynamic migration assay with distinct dwell times and relative cell occupancy as readouts, which may potentially be useful to probe cell-microenvironment interactions.",

Although the {beta}-PV load is considered a determinant for allergenicity, fish species express distinct {beta}-PV isoforms with unknown pathogenic contributions. To identify the role various parameters play in allergenicity, we have taken Gadus morhua and Scomber japonicus models, determined their {beta}-PV isoform composition and analyzed the interaction of the IgE from fish-allergic patient sera with these different conformations. We found that each fish species contains a major and a minor isoform, with the total PV content four times higher in Gadus morhua than in Scomber japonicus. The isoforms showing the best IgE recognition displayed protease-sensitive globular folds, and if forming amyloids, they were not immunoreactive. Of the isoforms displaying stable globular folds, one was not recognized by IgE under any of the conditions, and the other formed highly immunoreactive amyloids. The results showed that Gadus morhua muscles are equipped with an isoform combination and content that ensures the IgE recognition of all PV folds, whereas the allergenic load of Scomber japonicus is under the control of proteolysis. We conclude that the consideration of isoform properties and content may improve the explanation of fish species allergenicity differences.",

    "abstract": "In Fishers model of sexual selection, a female preference for a male trait spreads together with the trait because their genetic bases become correlated. This can be interpreted as a  greenbeard system: a preference gene, by inducing a female to mate with a trait-bearing male, favors itself because the male is disproportionately likely also to carry the preference gene. Here, we use this logic to argue that Fisherian sexual selection in diploids proceeds via two channels, corresponding to two reasons that trait-bearing males disproportionately carry preference genes: (i) trait-bearing males are disproportionately the product of matings between preference-bearing mothers and trait-bearing fathers, and thus trait and preference genes are correlated  in trans; (ii) trait and preference genes come into gametic phase disequilibrium, and thus are correlated  in cis. Gametic phase disequilibrium is generated by three distinct mechanisms: a  recombination mechanism, a  dominance mechanism, and a  sexual admixture mechanism. The trans channel does not operate when sexual selection is restricted to the haploid phase, and therefore represents a fundamental difference between haploid and diploid models of sexual selection. We use simulation experiments to artificially eliminate the cis channel, and show that a preference gene can spread in its absence in the diploid model, but not in the haploid model. We further show that the cis and trans channels contribute equally to the spread of the preference when recombination between the preference and trait loci is free, but that the trans channel becomes substantially more important when linkage is tight.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains a significant infectious lung disease that affects millions of patients worldwide. Despite numerous existing drug regimens for tuberculosis, Drug-Induced Liver Injury is a major challenge that limits the effectiveness of these therapeutics. Two drugs that form the backbone of the commonly administered quadruple antitubercular regimen, i.e. pyrazinamide (PZA) and isoniazid (INH), are associated with such hepatotoxicity. The problem is compounded by the lack of safe and effective alternatives to the antitubercular regimen. Consequently, current research largely focuses on exploiting the hepatoprotective effect of nutraceutical compounds as complementary therapy. Silibinin, a herbal product widely believed to protect against various liver diseases, potentially provides a useful solution given its hepatoprotective mechanisms. In our study, we identified silibinins role in mitigating PZA- and INH-induced hepatotoxicity and elucidated a deeper mechanistic understanding of silibinins hepatoprotective ability. 25 M silibinin preserved the viability of human foetal hepatocyte line LO2 when co-administered with 80 mM INH and decreased apoptosis induced by a combination of 40 mM INH and 10 mM PZA by reducing oxidative damage to mitochondria, proteins, and lipids. Taken together, this proof-of-concept forms the rational basis for the further investigation of silibinins hepatoprotective effect in subsequent preclinical studies and clinical trials.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/815241v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7dde5borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1914a77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aff684org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1616fa5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Gene essentiality estimation is a popular empirical approach to link genotypes to phenotypes. In humans, essentiality is estimated based on loss-of-function (LoF) mutation intolerance, either from population exome sequencing (in vivo) data or CRISPR-based in vitro perturbation experiments. Both approaches identify genes presumed to have strong detrimental consequences on the organism upon mutation. Are these genes functionally distinct and constrained by having key roles? Do in vivo and in vitro estimations equally recover these constraints? To address these questions, here we integrated disparate genome-scale datasets and compared structural, functional, and evolutionary features of essential genes versus genes with extremely high mutational tolerance and proteome expectation. We found that essentiality estimates do recover functional constraints. However, the organismal or cellular context of estimation leads to functionally contrasting properties underlying the constraint. Our results suggest that depletion of LoF mutations in human populations effectively captures developmental, organismal-level functional constraints not experimentally accessible through CRISPR-based screens. Finally, we identify a new set of genes (OrgEssential), which are intolerant of LoF mutation in vivo but highly tolerant in vitro. These genes drive observed functional constraint differences and have an unexpected preference for nervous system expression.",

In complex environments, organisms must remain responsive to specific inputs even as other internal or external factors fluctuate. Here we show how Caenorhabditis elegans can discriminate between food levels to modulate lifespan despite temperature perturbations. While robustness of fixed outputs has been described, our findings uncover a more complex robustness process that maintains food-responsiveness. This end-to-end robustness from environment to physiology is mediated by food-sensing neurons that communicate via TGF-{beta} and serotonin signals to form a multicellular gene network. Mechanistically, specific regulations in this network change with temperature to maintain similar food-responsiveness in the lifespan output. Together, our findings provide a basis for gene-environment interactions and unveil computations that integrate environmental cues to govern physiology.",

    "abstract": "When listening to natural speech, our neural activity tracks the speech envelope. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated that this neural envelope tracking can be affected by top-down processes. The present study was designed to examine if neural envelope tracking is modulated by the effort that a person expends during listening. Five measures were included to quantify listening effort: two behavioral measures based on a novel dual-task paradigm, a self-report effort measure and two neural measures related to neural phase synchronization and alpha power. Electroencephalography responses to sentences, presented at a wide range of subject-specific signal-to-noise ratios, were recorded in thirteen young, normal-hearing adults. A comparison of the five measures revealed different effects of listening effort as a function of speech understanding. Reaction times on the primary task and self-reported effort decreased with increasing speech understanding. In contrast, reaction times on the secondary task and alpha power showed a peak-shaped behavior with highest effort at intermediate speech understanding levels. We found a positive association between envelope tracking and speech understanding. While a significant effect of listening effort was found on theta-band envelope tracking, the effect size was negligible. Therefore, our results suggest that listening effort is not a confound when using envelope tracking to objectively measure speech understanding in young, normal-hearing adults.",

    "abstract": "The eyespot patterns found on the wings of nymphalid butterflies are novel serial homologous traits that originated first in hindwings and subsequently in forewings, suggesting that eyespot development might be dependent on Hox genes. Hindwings differ from forewings in the expression of Ultrabithorax (Ubx), but the function of this Hox gene in eyespot development as well as that of another Hox gene Antennapedia (Antp), expressed specifically in eyespots centers on both wings, are still unclear. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to target both genes in Bicyclus anynana butterflies. We show that Antp is essential for eyespot development on the forewings and for the differentiation of white centers and larger eyespots on hindwings, whereas Ubx is essential for the development of at least some hindwing eyespots but also for repressing the size of other eyespots. Additionally, Antp is essential for the development of silver scales in male wings. In summary, Antp and Ubx, in addition to their conserved roles in modifying serial homologous traits along the anterior-posterior axis of animals, have acquired a novel role in promoting the development of a new set of serial homologs, the eyespot patterns, in both forewings (Antp) and hindwings (Antp and Ubx) of B. anynana butterflies. We propose that the peculiar pattern of eyespot origins on hindwings first, followed by forewings, could be due to an initial co-option of Ubx into eyespot development, followed by a later, partially redundant co-option of Antp into the same network.",

Using the haplotype algorithm for FBATs to compute the conditional genotype distribution under the null hypothesis of Mendelian transmissions, virtually any association test statistics can be implemented in our approach and simulation-based or exact p-values can be computed without the need for asymptotic settings. Using simulations, we compare the features of the proposed test statistics in our framework with the existing region-based methodology for family-based studies under various scenarios. The tests of our framework outperform the existing approaches. We provide general guidelines for which scenarios, e.g., sparseness of the signals or local LD structure, which test statistic will have distinct power advantages over the others. We also illustrate our approach in an application to a whole-genome sequencing dataset with 897 asthmatic trios.",

In the mammalian brain, the DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt3a, is the sole \\\"writer\\\" of atypical non-CpG methylation (mCH), and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is the only known \\\"reader\\\" for mCH. We set out to determine if MeCP2 is the sole reader for Dnmt3a dependent methylation by comparing mice lacking either Dnmt3a or MeCP2 in GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Loss of either the writer or the reader causes overlapping and distinct features from the behavioral to the molecular level. Loss of Dnmt3a results in global loss of mCH and a small subset of mCG sites resulting in more widespread transcriptional alterations and severe neurological dysfunction than seen upon MeCP2 loss. These data indicate that MeCP2 is responsible for reading part of the Dnmt3a dependent methylation in the brain. Importantly, the impact of MeCP2 on genes differentially expressed in both cKO models shows a strong dependence on mCH, but not Dnmt3a dependent mCG, consistent with mCH playing a central role in the pathogenesis of Rett Syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Aphids are sap-feeding insects that colonize a broad range of plant species and often cause feeding damage and transmit plant pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and viroids. These insects feed from the plant vascular tissue, predominantly the phloem. However, it remains largely unknown how aphids, and other sap-feeding insects, establish intimate long-term interactions with plants. To identify aphid virulence factors, we took advantage of the ability of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae to colonize divergent plant species. We found that a M. persicae clone of near-identical females establishes stable colonies on nine plant species of five representative plant eudicot and monocot families that span the angiosperm phylogeny. Members of the novel aphid Ya family are differentially expressed in aphids on the nine plant species, are co-regulated and organized as tandem repeats in aphid genomes. Interestingly, aphids translocate Ya transcripts into plants and some transcripts migrate systemically within several plant species. RNAi-mediated knock down of Ya genes reduces M. persicae fecundity and M. persicae produces more progeny on transgenic plants that heterologously produce one of the systemically migrating Ya transcripts as a long non-coding (lnc)RNA. Taken together, our work led to the discovery of a new host-responsive aphid gene family that operate as virulence factors. Transcripts of this family translocate into plants, including a lncRNA that migrates systemically and promotes aphid reproduction.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe green peach aphid Myzus persicae causes yield losses of a diverse range of economically important crops primarily as a vector of more than 100 different plant pathogens. We found that a single genotype of M. persicae is able to colonize nine plant species, including diverse dicots and maize, indicating that this aphid is truly polyphagous. Members of a new aphid Ya family undergoes coordinated expression changes in M. persicae depending on the plant species. The aphids translocate Ya transcripts into plants during feeding and these RNAs migrate to systemic leaves. Moreover, heterologous in planta expression of M. persicae Ya1 as a long non-coding RNA promotes aphid reproduction. Our findings indicate that cross kingdom deployment of RNA is more common than thought.",

Less is known about neural network connectivity during social interactions involving trust, however, particularly as a function of closeness between an investor and a trustee. We examined network reactivity and connectivity in participants who played an economic trust game with close friends, strangers and a computer. Network reactivity analyses showed enhanced activation of the DMN to social relative to non-social outcomes. A novel network psychophysiological interaction analysis (nPPI) revealed enhanced connectivity between the DMN and the superior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule when experiencing reciprocated vs. violated trust from friends relative to strangers. Such connectivity tracked with differences in self-reported social closeness with these partners. Interestingly, reactivity of the executive control network (ECN), involved in decision processes, demonstrated no social vs. non-social preference, and ECN-ventral striatum (VS) connectivity did not track social closeness. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that DMN interacts with components of attention and control networks to signal the relative importance of positive experiences with close others vs. strangers.",

In order to address this inverse problem, a transform is proposed to map the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of each PPG cycle to those of the corresponding ECG cycle based on our proposed cardiovascular signal model. The proposed method is evaluated with different morphologies of the PPG and ECG signals on three benchmark datasets with a variety of combinations of age, weight, and health conditions using different training setups. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a high prediction accuracy greater than 0.92 in averaged correlation for each dataset when the model is trained subject-wise. With a signal processing and learning system that is designed synergistically, we are able to reconstruct ECG signals by exploiting the relation of these two types of cardiovascular measurement. The reconstruction capability of the proposed method can enable low-cost ECG screening from affordable wearable IoT devices for continuous and long-term monitoring.

Nine NAE and sixteen CER species were analysed in plasma samples from 999 members of 196 British Caucasian families, using targeted mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Heritability was estimated and GWAS analyses were undertaken; all target lipids were significantly heritable (h2 = 36%-62%). A missense variant (rs324420) in the gene encoding the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which degrades NAEs, associated at GWAS significance (P<2.15x10-8) with four NAEs (DHEA, PEA, LEA, VEA). The A allele of this SNP was associated with a 0.23 SD per-allele increase in plasma NAE species. Additionally, we found association between rs680379 in the SPTLC3 gene, which encodes a subunit of the rate limiting enzyme in CER biosynthesis, and a range of CER species (e.g. CER[N(24)S(19)]; P =4.82x10-27).

We apply sciMAP-ATAC to the adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex, where we profile cortical lamination and demonstrate the ability to analyze data from a single tissue position or compare a single cell type in adjacent positions. We also profile the human primary visual cortex, where we produce spatial trajectories through the cortex.

    "abstract": "Antibody repertoire sequencing (Ig-seq) has been widely used in studying humoral responses, with promising results. However, the promise of Ig-seq has not yet been fully realized, and key features of the antibody repertoire remain elusive or controversial. To clarify these key features, we analyzed 2,152 high-quality heavy chain antibody repertoires, representing 582 donors and a total of 360 million clones. Our study revealed that individuals exhibit very similar gene usage patterns for germline V, D, and J genes and that 53 core V genes contribute to more than 99% of the heavy chain repertoire. We further found that genetic background is sufficient but not necessary to determine usage of V, D, and J genes. Although gene usage pattern is not affected by age, we observed a significant sex preference for 24 V genes, 9 D genes and 5 J genes, but found no positional bias for V-D and D-J recombination. In addition, we found that the number of observed clones that were shared between any two repertoires followed a linear model and noted that the mutability of hot/cold spots and single nucleotides within antibody genes suggested a strand-specific somatic hypermutation mechanism. This population-level analysis resolves some critical characteristics of the antibody repertoire and thus may serve as a reference for research aiming to unravel B cell-related biology or diseases. The metrics revealed here will be of significant value to the large cadre of scientists who study the antibody repertoire.",

Wildlife disease hosts vary in characteristics related to pathogen transmission, which can increase the spread and intensity of disease outbreaks. The consequences of home range size variation on wildlife disease dynamics are poorly understood, but could help to predict disease spread and determine more effective disease management strategies.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a spatially-explicit individual-based model to examine the effect of variation in host home range size on the spatial spread rate, persistence, and incidence of rabies virus (RABV) in raccoons (Procyon lotor). We tested the hypothesis that host home range area variation decreases vaccination effectiveness in wildlife host populations following pathogen invasion into a vaccination zone.\\nC_LIO_LIWe simulated raccoon demography and RABV dynamics across a range of magnitudes and variances in weekly home range radius distributions for raccoons, and compared results to conditions that assumed a fixed host home range area. We examined how variable host home range radius distributions influenced the relative effectiveness of three components of orally-baited raccoon RABV vaccination (ORV) programs--timing and frequency of bait delivery, width of the zone where ORV baits were delivered, and proportion of hosts immunized.\\nC_LIO_LIVariability in home range radius distributions increased RABV spread rates by 1.2 - 5.2-fold compared to simulations with fixed radii. More variable host home range radius distributions decreased relative vaccination effectiveness by 71% compared to less variable host home range radius distributions under conventional vaccination conditions. We found that vaccination timing was more influential for vaccination effectiveness than vaccination frequency or vaccination zone width.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that variation in wildlife home range exploration increases the spatial spread and incidence of wildlife disease. Our vaccination results underscore the importance of prioritizing individual-level space use data collection to understand the dynamics of wildlife diseases and plan their effective control and elimination.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The coordination of tissue-level polarity with organism-level polarity is crucial in development, disease, and regeneration. Exploiting the flexibility of the body plan in regenerating planarians, we used mirror duplication of the primary axis to show how established tissue-level polarity adapts to new organism-level polarity. Tracking of cilia-driven flow to characterize planar cell polarity of the epithelium revealed a remarkable reorientation of tissue polarity in double-headed planarians. This reorientation is driven by signals produced by the intact brain and is not hampered by radiation-induced removal of stem cells. The nervous system itself adapts its polarity to match the new organismal anatomy in these animals as revealed by distinct regenerative outcomes driven by polarized nerve transport. Thus, signals from the central nervous system can dynamically control and re-orient tissue-level polarity to match the organism-level anatomical configuration, illustrating a novel role of the nervous system in the regulation of patterning.",

Pluripotent cells are capable of extensive self-renewal, yet remain highly sensitive to environmental perturbations in vitro, posing challenges to their therapeutic use. Here, we deployed innovative high-throughput screening strategies to identify a small molecule cocktail that dramatically improves viability of hPSCs and their differentiated progeny. We discovered that the combination of Chroman 1, Emricasan, Polyamines, and Trans-ISRIB (CEPT) enhanced cell survival of genetically stable hPSCs by simultaneously blocking several stress mechanisms that otherwise compromise cell structure and function. In proof-of-principle experiments we then demonstrated the strong improvements that CEPT provided for several key applications in stem cell research, including routine cell passaging, cryopreservation of pluripotent and differentiated cells, embryoid body and organoid formation, single-cell cloning, genome editing, and new iPSC line generation. Thus, CEPT represents a unique polypharmacology strategy for comprehensive cytoprotection, providing a new rationale for efficient and safe utilization of hPSCs. Conferring cell fitness by multi-target drug combinations may become a common approach in cryobiology, drug development, and regenerative medicine.",

The collagen bundles are remodeled during tumor progression: first tangential to the tumor boundary (indicating growth) and later perpendicular to the tumor boundary (indicating likely metastasis). Current reconstituted-collagen in vitro tumor models are unable to recapitulate the in vivo structural features of collagen bundling and alignment. Here, we present a rapid yet simple procedure to fabricate collagen bundles with an average thickness of 9 m, compared to the reticular dense collagen nanofiber ([~]900 nm-diameter, on average) prepared using common protocols. The versatility of the collagen bundles was demonstrated with their incorporation into two in vitro models where the thickness and alignment of the collagen bundles resembled the various in vivo arrangements. First, collagen bundles aligned by a microfluidic device elicited cancer cell contact guidance and enhanced their directional migration. Second, the presence of the collagen bundles in a bio-inert agarose hydrogel was shown to provide a highway for cancer cell invasion. The unique structural features of the collagen bundles advance the physiological relevance of in vitro collagen-based tumor models for accurately capturing cancer cell-stroma interactions.",

    "abstract": "Yeast and fast-growing human tumor cells share metabolic similarities in that both cells use fermentation of glucose for energy and both are highly sensitive to the glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose. Spontaneous mutations in S. cerevisiae that conferred resistance to 2-deoxyglucose were identified by whole genome sequencing. In addition to three aneuploid strains, we detected missense alleles of the HXK2, REG1, GLC7 and SNF1 genes that were shown to confer significant resistance to 2-deoxyglucose. All three missense alleles in HXK2 resulted in significantly reduced catalytic activity. Missense alleles affecting the Snf1 kinase pathway (REG1, GLC7 and SNF1) exhibited different capacities to affect the regulation of invertase expression. Of the seven missense alleles identified in this study, all but one affected hexose transporter endocytosis by increasing plasma membrane occupancy of the Hxt3 protein. Increased expression of the DOG (deoxyglucose) phosphatases has been associated with resistance to 2-deoxyglucose. Expression of both the DOG1 and DOG2 mRNA was elevated after treatment with 2-deoxyglucose. Deletion of the HXK2 and REG1 genes confers resistance to 2-deoxyglucose and causes increased expression of the DOG2 mRNA. We conclude that Snf1 kinase-mediated regulation of the endocytosis of the hexose transporters and regulation of DOG2 expression are important mechanisms for resistance to 2-deoxyglucose. However, the dominant SNF1-G53R allele can confer additional 2-deoxyglucose resistance in cells that are genetically compromised in both the endocytosis and DOG pathways. Thus at least one more mechanism for conferring resistance to this glucose analog remains to be discovered.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryYeast and fast-growing human tumor cells share metabolic similarities in that both cells use fermentation of glucose for energy and both are highly sensitive to the glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose. Another similarity between yeast cells and human tumor cells is that both cells can acquire resistance to 2-deoxyglucose, an outcome that can limit the usefulness of some cancer therapeutics. In this study, we used bakers yeast as a model organism to better understand the mechanism of toxicity and acquisition of resistance to 2-deoxyglucose. Spontaneous mutations in S. cerevisiae that conferred resistance to 2-deoxyglucose were isolated and identified by whole genome sequencing, a technology that was not available until recently. Our studies indicate that 2-deoxyglucose becomes toxic after it is phosphorylated by an enzyme called hexokinase. One important route to resistance is to reduce hexokinase activity. Other parallel pathways to resistance include increased expression of a hydrolase that degrades the toxic metabolite, altered localization of glucose transporters and altered glucose signal transduction pathways.",

    "abstract": "A lot of evidence demonstrates that sheep could represent an experimental model to set up medical procedures in a view of their application on humans. Sheep are chosen as model for human biomechanical studies because their skeleton has some similarities with humans. Sheep are gyrencephalic so the cerebral cortex can show valuable signposts to identify particular cortical regions, unlike rats that are lissencephalic animals. The aim of this work was to set up sheep primary cultures from ovine fetuses at different ages, from pregnant uteri retrieved at local abattoirs. Cell characterization demonstrated that one cell population was immunopositive to GFAP and identifiable as astrocytes, whereas a second cell type was III {beta}-tubulin-positive, and hence classified as neurons. A 60 day old fetus is suitable to obtain neurons, whereas in a 90 day old fetus the cell culture is predominantly characterized by glial cells. The procedure here proposed is inexpensive. Indeed, the fetuses casually found during sheep slaughtering have no cost, unlike the classical experimental animals, such as mice, rats, rabbits, that require very high economical efforts. Finally, our protocol fully eliminates the need of animal killing, being living animals replaced by a validated in vitro model in agreement with the 3Rs statement.",

    "abstract": "The potential of feed ingredients to serve as vehicles for African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) introduction to the US is a significant concern. ASFV DNA has been detected in the Chinese feed system; raw grains and meals drying on the ground and milling facilities and feed delivery vehicles. Experimental evidence of ASFV survival in multiple soy-based feed ingredients during a simulated 30-day transoceanic journey and the transmission of ASFV through the natural consumption of contaminated feed has been published. Therefore, its important to understand the quantity of soy-based ingredients that enter the US from ASFV-positive countries via ocean shipping and rank sea ports of Entry (POEs) according to annual volume of these products to manage this risk.\n\nThe quantity of soy-based feed ingredients and their specific ports of entry was obtained at the International Trade Commission Harmonized Tariff Schedule website (www.hs.usitc.gov), a publically available website that provides a transaction of specific trade commodities between the US and its international trading partners. A close review of this database identified 10 HTS codes pertaining to soy-based feed ingredients, including soybeans, soybean meal, soy oil cake and soy oil. Specific queries on these 10 HTS codes were designed to provide information on country of origin, quantity of product, date of entry, and POE into the US. Data were exported into Microsoft Excel, then organized into pivot tables that described the quantity of specific product by country of origin and POE. The analysis focused on the 43 ASFV-positive countries on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Watch List.\n\nIn 2018, 104,707 metric tons (MT) of soy-based ingredients were imported to the US from a total of nine foreign countries that are included on the CFIA Watch List. 52.6 % of this volume that was imported, or 55,101 MT, originated from China. These soy-based products from China entered the US from a total of 13 separate ports of entry (POEs). Of these POEs, a total of 4 POEs received greater than 88% of all of soy-based ingredients originating from CHina, including San Francisco/Oakland, CA (60.36%), Seattle, WA (20.54%), Baltimore, MD (4.13%), and Los Angeles, CA (3.78%).\n\nThis is a new approach to analyze the risk management of feed imports, focusing on seaport of highest risk and quantity of product received. This work represents an initial step towards building a comprehensive listing of imported products introduced into the pork supply chain, and provide a roadmap to understanding risks involved in global livestock feed ingredient sourcing.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the resting behavior, host preference and infection with Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites by malaria vectors in different ecological settings of western Kenya with different levels of insecticide resistance.\n\nMethodsIndoor and outdoor resting Anopheline mosquitoes were sampled during the dry and rainy seasons in Kisian (lowland site) and Bungoma (highland site), both in western Kenya. WHO tube bioassay was used to determine levels of phenotypic resistance of first generation offspring (F1 progeny) of malaria vectors resting indoors and outdoors to deltamethrin. PCR-based molecular diagnostics were used for mosquito speciation, genotype for resistance mutations and to determine specific host blood meal origins. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to determine mosquito sporozoite infections.\n\nResultsOverall, 3,566 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected with Anopheles gambiae s.l [In Bungoma, An. gambiae s.s (90.9%), An arabiensis (7.6%) and in Kisian, An. gambiae s.s (38.9%), An. arabiensis (60.2%)] being the most abundant species (74.7%) followed by An. funestus s.l (25.3%). The majority of An. gambiae s.l (85.4 and 58%) and An. funestus (96.6 and 91.1%) were caught resting indoors in Bungoma and Kisian respectively.Vgsc-1014S was observed at a slightly higher frequency in An. gambiae s.s hereafter(An. gambiae) resting indoor than outdoor (89.7 vs 84.6% and 71.5 vs 61.1%) in Bungoma and Kisian respectively. For An. arabiensis, Vgsc-1014S was 18.2% indoor and outdoor (17.9%) in Kisian. In Bungoma, the Vgsc-1014S was only detected in An. arabiensis resting indoors with a frequency of 10%. The Vgsc-1014F mutation was only present in An. gambiae resting indoors from both sites, but at very low frequencies in Kisian compared to Bungoma (0.8 and 9.2% respectively. In Bungoma, the sporozoite rates for An. funestus, An. gambiae, and An. arabiensis resting indoors were 10.9, 7.6 and 3.4 % respectively. For outdoor resting, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis in Bungoma, the sporozoite rates were 4.7 and 2.9 % respectively.Overall, in Bungoma, the sporozoite rate for indoor resting mosquitoes was 8.6% and 4.2% for outdoors. In Kisian the sporozoite rate was 0.9% for indoor resting An. gambiae. None of the outdoor collected mosquitoes in Kisian tested positive for sporozoite infections.\n\nConclusionThe study reports high densities of insecticide-resistant An. gambiae and An. funestus resting indoors and the persistence of malaria transmission indoors with high entomological inoculation rates (EIR) regardless of the use of Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). These findings underline the difficulties of controlling malaria vectors resting and biting indoors using the current interventions. Supplemental vector control tools and implementation of sustainable insecticide resistance management strategies are needed in western Kenya.",

In laboratory animals IRI can be ameliorated by ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) and pharmacological preconditioning (PPC) with dexmedetomidine. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PPC with dexmedetomidine or IPC in an equine model of small intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion (IR).\\n\\nIn a randomized controlled experimental trial, 15 horses were assigned to three groups: control (C), IPC, and PPC with dexmedetomidine (DEX). All horses were placed under general anaesthesia and 90% jejunal ischaemia was induced for 90 minutes, followed 30 minutes of reperfusion. In group IPC, three short bouts of ischaemia and reperfusion were implemented, and group DEX received a continuous rate infusion of dexmedetomidine prior to the main ischaemia. Jejunal biopsies were collected before ischaemia (P), and at the end of ischaemia (I) and reperfusion (R). Mucosal injury was assessed by the Chiu-Score, inflammatory cells were stained by cytosolic calprotectin. The degree of apoptosis and cell necrosis was assessed by cleaved-caspase-3 and TUNEL.\\n\\nParametric data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements followed by Dunnetts t-test. Non parametric data were compared between groups at the different time points by a Kruskal-Wallis-Test and a Wilcoxon-2-Sample-test.\\n\\nThe mucosal injury score increased during I in all groups. After reperfusion, IRI further progressed in group C, but not in IPC and DEX. In all groups the number of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positive cells increased from P to I. The number of TUNEL positive cells were lower in group DEX compared to group C after I and R. Infiltration with calprotectin positive cells was less pronounced in group DEX compared to group C, whereas in group IPC more calprotectin positive cells were seen.\\n\\nIn conclusion, IPC and DEX exert protective effects in experimental small intestinal ischaemia in horses.",

Data were analysed using inductive content analysis.\n\nResultsA total of 14 Indigenous Australian and 14 non-Indigenous pregnant women participated in this study. Analysis identified five main influences on pregnant womens alcohol use: the level and detail of womens understanding of harm; womens information sources on alcohol use in pregnancy; how this information influenced their choices; how women conceptualised their pregnancy; and whether the social and cultural environment supported abstinence.\n\nConclusions for practiceThis study provides insight into how Indigenous Australian and non-Indigenous pregnant women understand and conceptualise the harms from drinking alcohol, including how their social and cultural environments impact their ability to abstain.

    "abstract": "Atrial metabolic disturbance contributes to the onset and development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Autophagy plays a role in maintaining the cellular energy balance. We examined whether the altered atrial expression of genes related to fatty acid metabolism is linked to that related to autophagy in chronic AF. Right atrial tissue was obtained during heart surgery from 51 patients with sinus rhythm (SR, n=38) or chronic AF (n=13). Preoperative fasting serum free-fatty-acid levels were significantly higher in the AF patients. The atrial gene expression of fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), which is involved in the cells fatty acid uptake and intracellular fatty acid transport, was significantly increased in AF patients compared to SR patients; in the SR patients it was positively correlated with the right atrial diameter and intra-atrial EMD, parameters of structural and electrical atrial remodeling that was evaluated by an echocardiography. In contrast, the two groups atrial contents of diacylglycerol (DAG), a toxic fatty acid metabolite, were comparable. Importantly, the atrial gene expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) was significantly increased in the AF patients, and autophagy-related genes including LC3 were positively correlated with the atrial expression of FABP3. In conclusion, in chronic AF patients, the atrial expression of FABP3 was upregulated in association with autophagy-related genes without altered atrial DAG content. Our findings may support the hypothesis that dysregulated cardiac fatty acid metabolism contributes to the progression of AF and induction of autophagy has a cardioprotective effect against cardiac lipotoxicity in chronic AF.",

    "abstract": "Habits are automated behaviors that are insensitive to changes in behavioral outcomes. Habitual responding is thought to be mediated by striatum, with medial striatum guiding goal-directed action and lateral striatum promoting habits. However, interspersed throughout the striatum are neurochemically differing subcompartments known as patches, which are characterized by distinct molecular profiles relative to the surrounding matrix tissue. These structures have been thoroughly characterized neurochemically and anatomically, but little is known regarding their function. Patches have been shown to be selectively activated during inflexible motor stereotypies elicited by stimulants, suggesting that patches may subserve habitual behaviors. To explore this possibility, we utilized transgenic mice (Sepw1 NP67) expressing Cre recombinase in striatal patches to target these neurons for selective ablation with a virus driving Cre-dependent expression of caspase 3. Mice were then trained to press a lever for sucrose rewards on a variable interval schedule to elicit habitual responding. Mice were not impaired on the acquisition of this task, but lesioning striatal patches disrupted behavioral stability across training and lesioned mice utilized a more goal-directed behavioral strategy during training. Similarly, when mice were forced to omit responses to receive sucrose rewards, habitual responding was impaired in lesioned mice. To rule out effects of lesion on motor behaviors, mice were then tested for impairments in motor learning on a rotarod and locomotion in an open field. We found that patch lesions specifically impaired initial performance on the rotarod without modifying locomotor behaviors in open field. This work indicates that patches promote behavioral stability and habitual responding, adding to a growing literature implicating striatal patches in stimulus-response behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Although statistics play a significant role in the medical profession, studying medical statistics is challenging because this topic is more difficult to comprehend than other subjects included in medical curricula. Therefore, improving the teaching of medical statistics to meet the requirements of modern medical students/physicians is an essential task. In this study, based on responses about studying medical statistics completed by medical students, we developed a novel approach to teaching medical statistics named \"purpose, database, types of variable, and relationship between variables (PDTR)\", which emphasizes how to simply master statistical applications and reduces class hours for students. Also, pilot course was implemented. We discovered that the participants using PDTR performed better on examinations of medical statistics than did graduates of institutions using traditional teaching methods (86.39{+/-}3.72 vs 73.72{+/-}6.58, P < 0.001). In addition, positive feedback was received by participants (>80%). Altogether, as a completely novel pedagogical method of teaching medical statistics, PDTR overcomes the negative attitudes of students towards medical statistics, enhances enthusiasm for learning statistics, and remarkably simplifies the process of studying statistical applications. These advantages are undoubtedly conductive to improving the effective use of medical statistics in physicians professional work.",

    "abstract": "Brazilian hair sheep constitute a genetic diversity hotspot of sheep breeds. These locally adapted genetic resources developed in harsh environments of the Brazilian Northwest (semi-arid) and maintained important traits for this region, such as parasite resistance, heat tolerance and high pelt quality. Genotypes (50K SNP chip) from seven Brazilian sheep breeds (5 hair and 2 coarse wool types) and 87 worldwide breeds were used to verify population structure, admixture and genetic diversity, using PCA and ADMIXTURE analyses. We constructed a phylogenetic tree and evaluated migration events between genetic groups using TREEMIX software. Brazilian Somali, a fat-tailed breed, was the unique breed with high relationship with East African breeds and formed a distinct cluster from other Brazilian breeds. This breed seems to contribute to formation of Santa Ines, Morada Nova and Brazilian Fat-tail breeds. Brazilian Blackbelly had a clear relationship with Barbados Blackbelly, which appeared as another group. Other Brazilian breeds seem to form a further genetic group with some recent admixtures. Morada Nova remained as a separate group, not showing a strong relationship with European or African breeds, only revealing a migration event from Sidaoun, an Algerian hair breed. Brazilian Fat-tail and Morada Nova share a common ancestor, but the first received introgressions from Brazilian Somali and Afrikaner breeds, explaining the fat-tail phenotype. Santa Ines received strong contribution from Bergamasca and had an admixed origin with recent introgressions from other breeds, mainly from Suffolk animals. In conclusion, Brazilian Somali and Brazilian Fat-tail are the most endangered sheep genetic resources in Brazil.",
