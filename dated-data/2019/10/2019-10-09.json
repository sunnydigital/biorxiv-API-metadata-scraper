    "abstract": "1.Rhizobium nitrogen-fixing bacteria are a well studied microorganism family in the scientific community and its effects have been investigated thoroughly since its initial identification. This study aimed to research further the interactions of this bacteria with members of non-legume plant families, i.e. the poaceae grass species. This multi-year experimental series focuses on the germination stage of these plants, with varying treatments being applied to the seeds pre-germination in order to first test for a quantifiable effect taking place, and later to characterise the mechanism due to which an effect was noted. The identifier used to establish the presence of an effect was the germination rate of the seeds, which was found by examining the testa of each seed for the emergence of a radicle or plumule. Approximately 15,000 samples were tested during this process, the results of which were subsequently statistically analysed at a 95% confidence level. A conclusive increase of 40% (p<0.0001) was noted in the germination of barley seeds when treated with R. leguminosarum. Following tests which confirmed increase enzymatic activity, tests using a different bacterium (A. tumefaciens) and further review of existing literature, it was deemed likely that this effect was due to the release of lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) by the bacteria. It has been established that synthetically isolated LCOs can positively effect barley germination. It is believed that this is the first time it has been demonstrated that free Rhizobium bacteria in suspension can stimulate faster germination in the poaceae species due to the natural release of LCOs by the bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for tissue repair and regeneration has garnered great attention. While MSC interaction with microbes at sites of tissue damage and inflammation is likely, especially in the gut, the consequences of bacterial association have yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the effect of Salmonella enterica ssp enterica serotype Typhimurium on MSC trilineage differentiation path and mechanism. Through examination of key markers of differentiation, immunomodulatory regulators, and inflammatory cytokines, we demonstrated that Salmonella altered osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation pathways in human and goat adipose-derived MSCs. Gene expression profiles defined signaling pathway alterations in response to Salmonella association not observed in epithelial cells. We uncovered significant differential expression (P < 0.05) of genes associated with anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative responses in MSCs during Salmonella challenge. These observations led us to conclude that bacteria, specifically Salmonella, induce pathways that influence functional differentiation trajectories in MSCs, thus implicating substantial microbial influence on MSC physiology and immune activity.",

    "abstract": "Compulsions, defined by debilitating repetitive actions, permeate many mental illnesses and are challenging to treat partly because of a limited understanding of their neurobiological underpinnings. Accumulating evidence suggests the rodent model of Schedule-Induced Polydipsia (SIP) as a promising pre-clinical assay to elucidate the neurobiological and behavioural manifestations of compulsivity. In the rodent SIP paradigm, susceptible rats develop adjunctive excessive drinking when they are chronically food restricted and presented with food pellets according to a fixed-time schedule. We found that normally, bi-directional plasticity of GABA synapses in the oval bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) tightly followed the rats satiety state where low-frequency stimulation-induced potentiation (LTPO_SCPCAPGABAC_SCPCAP) prevailed in sated rats whilst food restriction uncovered long-term depression (LTDO_SCPCAPGABAC_SCPCAP). In rats that developed excessive drinking during SIP, removing the caloric restriction failed at reverting LTDO_SCPCAPGABAC_SCPCAP to LTPO_SCPCAPGABAC_SCPCAP whereas bi-directional plasticity at ovBNST GABA synapses was unaltered in low-drinking SIP-trained rats. Excessive drinking ceased in polydipsic rats removed from their caloric restriction; however, these rats retained a form of compulsive schedule-induced checking (SIC) and impaired plasticity at ovBNST GABA synapses for several days following termination of the caloric restriction. We conclude that altered bi-directional plasticity at ovBNST GABA synapses is a neurophysiological trace of compulsivity in susceptible rats in the SIP model.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput in vitro drug assays have been impacted by recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) technology and by contact-free all-optical systems simultaneously measuring action potential (AP) and Ca2+ transient (CaTr). Parallel computational advances have shown that in silico models can predict drug effects with high accuracy. In this work, we combine these in vitro and in silico technologies and demonstrate the utility of high-throughput experimental data to refine in silico hiPS-CM populations, and to predict and explain drug action mechanisms. Optically-obtained hiPS-CM AP and CaTr were used from spontaneous activity and under pacing in control and drug conditions at multiple doses.\n\nAn updated version of the Paci2018 model was developed to refine the description of hiPS-CM spontaneous electrical activity; a population of in silico hiPS-CMs was constructed and calibrated using the optically-recorded AP and CaTr. We tested five drugs (astemizole, dofetilide, ibutilide, bepridil and diltiazem), and compared simulations against in vitro optical recordings.\n\nOur simulations showed that physiologically-accurate population of models can be obtained by integrating AP and CaTr control records. Thus constructed population of models predicted correctly the drug effects and occurrence of adverse episodes, even though the population was optimized only based on control data and in vitro drug testing data were not deployed during its calibration. Furthermore, the in silico investigation yielded mechanistic insights, e.g. through simulations, bepridils more pro-arrhythmic action in adult cardiomyocytes compared to hiPS-CMs could be traced to the different expression of ion currents in the two.\n\nTherefore, our work: i) supports the utility of all-optical electrophysiology in providing high-content data to refine experimentally-calibrated populations of in silico hiPS-CMs, ii) offers insights into certain limitations when translating results obtained in hiPS-CMs to humans and shows the strength of combining high-throughput in vitro and population in silico approaches.\n\nSignificanceWe demonstrate the integration of human in silico drug trials and optically-recorded simultaneous action potential and calcium transient data from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) for prediction and mechanistic investigations of drug action. We propose a population of in silico models i) based on a new hiPS-CM model recapitulating the mechanisms underlying hiPS-CM automaticity and ii) calibrated with all-optical measurements. We used our in silico population to predict and evaluate the effects of 5 drugs and the underlying biophysical mechanisms, obtaining results in agreement with our experiments and one independent dataset. This work supports the use of high-content, high-quality all-optical electrophysiology data to develop, calibrate and validate computer models of hiPS-CM for in silico drug trials.",

    "abstract": "Due to the overlapping emission spectra of fluorophores, fluorescence microscopy images often have bleed-through problems, leading to a false positive detection. This problem is almost unavoidable when the samples are labeled with three or more fluorophores, and the situation is complicated even further when imaged under a multiphoton microscope. Several methods have been developed and commonly used by biologists for fluorescence microscopy spectral unmixing, such as linear unmixing, non-negative matrix factorization, deconvolution, and principal component analysis. However, they either require pre-knowledge of emission spectra or restrict the number of fluorophores to be the same as detection channels, which highly limits the real-world applications of those spectral unmixing methods. In this paper, we developed a robust and flexible spectral unmixing method: Learning Unsupervised Means of Spectra (LUMoS), which uses an unsupervised machine learning clustering method to learn individual fluorophores spectral signatures from mixed images, and blindly separate channels without restrictions on the number of fluorophores that can be imaged. This method highly expands the hardware capability of two-photon microscopy to simultaneously image more fluorophores than is possible with instrumentation alone. Experimental and simulated results demonstrated the robustness of LUMoS in multi-channel separations of two-photon microscopy images. We also extended the application of this method to background/autofluorescence removal and colocalization analysis. Lastly, we integrated this tool into ImageJ to offer an easy to use spectral unmixing tool for fluorescence imaging. LUMoS allows us to gain a higher spectral resolution and obtain a cleaner image without the need to upgrade the imaging hardware capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Capicua (CIC), a member of the high mobility group (HMG)-box superfamily of transcriptional repressors, is frequently mutated in human oligodendrogliomas. But its function in brain development and tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we report that brain-specific deletion of Cic compromises developmental transition of neuroblast to immature neurons in mouse hippocampus and compromises normal neuronal differentiation. Combined gene expression and ChIP-seq analyses identified VGF as an important CIC-repressed transcriptional surrogates involved in neuronal lineage regulation. Aberrant VGF expression promotes neural progenitor cell proliferation by suppressing their differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CIC represses VGF expression by tethering SIN3-HDAC to form a transcriptional corepressor complex. Mass spectrometry analysis of CIC-interacting proteins further identified BRG1 containing mSWI/SNF complex of which function is necessary for transcriptional repression by CIC. Together, this study uncovers a novel regulatory pathway of CIC-dependent neuronal differentiation and provides molecular insights into the etiology of CIC-dependent brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "The steroid hormone progesterone, acting through the progesterone receptor (PR), a ligand-activated DNA-binding transcription factor, plays an essential role in regulating nearly every aspect of female reproductive biology. While many reproductive traits regulated by PR are conserved in mammals, Catarrhine primates evolved several derived traits including spontaneous decidualization, menstruation, and a divergent (and unknown) parturition signal, suggesting that PR may also have evolved divergent functions in Catarrhines. There is conflicting evidence, however, whether the progesterone receptor gene (PGR) was positively selected in the human lineage. Here we show that PGR evolved rapidly in the human stem-lineage (as well as other Catarrhine primates), which likely reflects an episode of relaxed selection intensity rather than positive selection. Coincident with the episode of relaxed selection intensity, ancestral sequence resurrection and functional tests indicate that the major human PR isoforms (PR-A and PR-B) evolved divergent functions in the human stem-lineage. These results suggest that the regulation of progesterone signaling by PR-A and PR-B may also have diverged in the human lineage and that non-human animal models of progesterone signaling may not faithfully recapitulate human biology.",

    "abstract": "Seeds are complex biological systems comprising three genetically distinct tissues nested one inside another (embryo, endosperm and maternal tissues). However, the complexity of the kernel makes it difficult to understand inter compartment interactions without access to spatially accurate information. Here we took advantage of the large size of the maize kernel to characterize genome-wide expression profiles of tissues at embryo/endosperm interfaces. Our analysis identifies specific transcriptomic signatures in two interface tissues compared to whole seed compartments: The scutellar aleurone layer (SAL), and the newly named endosperm adjacent to scutellum (EAS). The EAS, which appears around 9 days after pollination and persists for around 11 days, is confined to one to three endosperm cell layers adjacent to the embryonic scutellum. Its transcriptome is enriched in genes encoding transporters. The absence of the embryo in an embryo specific (emb) mutant can alter the expression pattern of EAS marker genes. The detection of cell death in some EAS cells together with an accumulation of crushed cell walls suggests that the EAS is a dynamic zone from which cell layers in contact with the embryo are regularly eliminated, and to which additional endosperm cells are recruited as the embryo grows.",

    "abstract": "Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) persists within hosts via infectious spread (de novo infection) and mitotic spread (infected cell proliferation), creating a population structure of multiple clones (infected cell populations with identical genomic proviral integration sites). The relative contributions of infectious and mitotic spread to HTLV-1 persistence are unknown, and will determine the efficacy of different approaches to treatment.\\n\\nThe prevailing view is that infectious spread is negligible in HTLV-1 proviral load maintenance beyond early infection. However, in light of recent high-throughput data on the abundance of HTLV-1 clones, and recent estimates of HTLV-1 clonal diversity that are substantially higher than previously thought (typically between 104 and 105 HTLV-1+ T cell clones in the body of an asymptomatic carrier or patient with HAM/TSP), ongoing infectious spread during chronic infection remains possible.\\n\\nWe estimate the ratio of infectious to mitotic spread using a hybrid model of deterministic and stochastic processes, fitted to previously published HTLV-1 clonal diversity estimates. We investigate the robustness of our estimates using two alternative methods. We find that, contrary to previous belief, infectious spread persists during chronic infection, even after HTLV-1 proviral load has reached its set point, and we estimate that between 100 and 200 new HTLV-1 clones are created and killed every day. We find broad agreement between all three methods.\\n\\nThe risk of HTLV-1-associated malignancy and inflammatory disease is strongly correlated with proviral load, which in turn is correlated with the number of HTLV-1-infected clones, which are created by de novo infection. Our results therefore imply that suppression of de novo infection may reduce the risk of malignant transformation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThere are no effective antiretroviral treatments against Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), which causes a range of inflammatory diseases and the aggressive malignancy Adult T-cell Leukaemia/Lymphoma (ATL) in approximately 10% of infected people. Within hosts the virus spreads via infectious spread (de novo infection) and mitotic spread (infected cell division). The relative contributions of each mechanism are unknown, and have major implications for drug development and clinical management of infection. We estimate the ratio of infectious to mitotic spread during the infections chronic phase using three methods. Each method indicates infectious spread at low but persistent levels after proviral load has reached set point, contrary to the prevailing view that infectious spread features in early infection only. Risk of disease in HTLV-1 infection is known to increase with proviral load, via mutations accrued from repeated infected cell division. Our analyses suggest that ongoing infectious spread may provide an additional mechanism whereby chronic infection becomes malignant. Further, because antiretroviral drugs against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) inhibit HTLV-1 infectious spread, they may reduce the risk of HTLV-1 malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Recovery from perturbations during walking is primarily mediated by reactive control strategies that coordinate multiple body segments to maintain balance. Balance control is often impaired in clinical populations who walk with spatiotemporally asymmetric gait, and, as a result, rehabilitation efforts often seek to reduce asymmetries in these populations. Previous work has demonstrated that the presence of spatiotemporal asymmetries during walking does not impair the control of whole-body dynamics during perturbation recovery. However, it remains to be seen how the neuromotor system adjusts intersegmental coordination patterns to maintain invariant whole-body dynamics. Here, we determined if the neuromotor system generates stereotypical coordination patterns irrespective of the level of asymmetry or if the neuromotor system allows for variance in intersegmental coordination patterns to stabilize whole-body dynamics. Nineteen healthy participants walked on a dual-belt treadmill at a range of step length asymmetries, and they responded to unpredictable, slip-like perturbations. We used principal component analysis of segmental angular momenta to characterize intersegmental coordination patterns before, during, and after imposed perturbations. We found that two principal components were sufficient to explain ~ 95% of the variance in segmental angular momentum during both steading walking and responses to perturbations. Our results also revealed that walking with asymmetric step lengths led to changes in intersegmental coordination patterns during the perturbation and during subsequent recovery steps without affecting whole-body angular momentum. These results suggest that the nervous system allows for variance in segment-level coordination patterns to maintain invariant control of whole-body angular momentum during walking. Future studies exploring how these segmental coordination patterns change in individuals with asymmetries that result from neuromotor impairments can provide further insight into how the healthy and impaired nervous system regulates dynamic balance during walking.",

    "abstract": "Disease development and cell differentiation both involve dynamic changes; therefore, the reconstruction of dynamic gene regulatory networks (DGRNs) is an important but difficult problem in systems biology. With recent technical advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), large volumes of scRNA-seq data are being obtained for various processes. However, most current methods of inferring DGRNs from bulk samples may not be suitable for scRNA-seq data. In this work, we present scPADGRN, a novel DGRN inference method using time-series scRNA-seq data. scPADGRN combines the preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers with cell clustering for DGRN reconstruction. It exhibits advantages in accuracy, robustness and fast convergence. Moreover, a quantitative index called Differentiation Genes Interaction Enrichment (DGIE) is presented to quantify the interaction enrichment of genes related to differentiation. From the DGIE scores of relevant subnetworks, we infer that the functions of embryonic stem (ES) cells are most active initially and may gradually fade over time. The communication strength of known contributing genes that facilitate cell differentiation increases from ES cells to terminally differentiated cells. We also identify several genes responsible for the changes in the DGIE scores occurring during cell differentiation based on three real single-cell datasets. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analyses based on network inference coupled with quantitative computations can reveal key transcriptional regulators involved in cell differentiation and disease development.\\n\\nAuthor summarySingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are gaining popularity for providing access to cell-level measurements. Currently, time-series scRNA-seq data allow researchers to study dynamic changes during biological processes. This work proposes a novel method, scPADGRN, for application to time-series scRNA-seq data to construct dynamic gene regulatory networks, which are informative for investigating dynamic changes during disease development and cell differentiation. The proposed method shows satisfactory performance on both simulated data and three real datasets concerning cell differentiation. To quantify network dynamics, we present a quantitative index, DGIE, to measure the degree of activity of a certain set of genes in a regulatory network. Quantitative computations based on dynamic networks identify key regulators in cell differentiation and reveal the activity states of the identified regulators. Specifically, Bhlhe40, Msx2, Foxa2 and Dnmt3l might be important regulatory genes involved in differentiation from mouse ES cells to primitive endoderm (PrE) cells. For differentiation from mouse embryonic fibroblast cells to myocytes, Scx, Fos and Tcf12 are suggested to be key regulators. Sox5, Meis2, Hoxb3, Tcf7l1 and Plagl1 critically contribute during differentiation from human ES cells to definitive endoderm cells. These results may guide further theoretical and experimental efforts to understand cell differentiation processes and explore cell heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Recent discussions in the literature, along with the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) [2], suggest aetiological commonalities between the highly comorbid Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Addressing this discussion requires studying these disorders together by comparing constructs typical to each of them. In the present study, we investigate global processing, known to be difficult for participants with ASD, and Intra-Subject Variability (ISV), known to be consistently increased in participants with ADHD, in groups, aged 10-13 years, with ADHD (n=25), ASD without comorbid ADHD (ASD-) (n=13) and ASD with ADHD (ASD+) (n=18) in comparison with a typically developing group (n=22). A Copying task, typically requiring global processing and in this case particularly designed using equally complex stimuli to also measure ISV across trials, was selected. Oculomotor measures in this task proved to be particularly sensitive to group differences. While increased ISV was not observed in the present task in participants with ADHD, both ASD groups needed to look longer on the figure to be drawn, indicating that global processing takes longer in ASD. However, the ASD+ group needed to fixate on the figure only between drawing movements, whereas the ASD-group needed to do this throughout the drawing process. The present study provides evidence towards ASD and ADHD being separate, not-overlapping, disorders. Since the pure ASD-group was affected more by central coherence problems than the ASD+ group, it may suggest that neuropsychological constructs interact differently in different clinical groups and sub-groups.",

    "abstract": "A total of 130 lepidopteran larvae were selected from 37 fogging samples at the Panguana station, district Yuyapichis, province Puerto Inca, department Huanuco, Peru. Target trees were pre-identified and subsequently submitted to molecular confirmation of identity with three markers (rbcL, psbA and trnL-F). Identification of 119 lepidopteran larvae (92 species) was successful through DNA barcoding: Comparison of COI barcodes with the reference database of adult moths resulted in 65 (55%) matches at species level, 32 (27%) at genus level and 19 (16%) at subfamily or family level. Three larvae could not be assigned to a family. For these larvae the fogged target tree now suggests a potential host-plant relationship. Molecular gut content analysis, based on High-Throughput-Sequencing was successfully tested for ten larvae corroborating feeding on the target plant in some cases but elucidating several other cases of potential  alternative feeding. We propose a larger-scale approach using this rapid and efficient method including molecular gut-content analyses for comprehensively testing the ratio of  alternative feeders and pitfalls caused by collateral fogging of larvae from neighboring trees.",
