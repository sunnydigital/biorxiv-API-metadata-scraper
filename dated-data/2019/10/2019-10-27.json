    "abstract": "SignificanceWe propose a novel video-based, motion-resilient, and fast method for estimating the position of optodes on the scalp.\n\nAimMeasuring the exact placement of probes (e.g., electrodes, optodes) on a participants head is a notoriously difficult step in acquiring neuroimaging data from methods which rely on scalp recordings (e.g., EEG and fNIRS), and is particularly difficult for any clinical or developmental population. Existing methods of head measurements require the participant to remain still for a lengthy period of time, are laborious, and require extensive training. Therefore, a fast and motion-resilient method is required for estimating the scalp location of probes.\n\nApproachWe propose an innovative video-based method for estimating the probes positions relative to the participants head, which is fast, motion-resilient, and automatic. Our method builds on capitalizing the advantages, and understanding the limitations, of cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning tool. We validate our method on 10 adult subjects and provide proof of feasibility with infant subjects.\n\nResultsWe show that our method is both reliable and valid compared to existing state-of-the-art methods by estimating probe positions in a single measurement, and by tracking their translation and consistency across sessions. Finally, we show that our automatic method is able to estimate the position of probes on an infant head without lengthy offline procedures, a task which is considered challenging until now.\n\nConclusionsOur proposed method allows, for the first time, the use of automated spatial co-registration methods on developmental and clinical populations, where lengthy, motion-sensitive measurement methods routinely fail.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMouse lemurs (Microcebus) are a radiation of morphologically cryptic primates distributed throughout Madagascar for which the number of recognized species has exploded in the past two decades. This taxonomic explosion has prompted understandable concern that there has been substantial oversplitting in the mouse lemur clade. Here, we take an integrative approach to investigate species diversity in two pairs of sister lineages that occur in a region in northeastern Madagascar with high levels of microendemism and predicted habitat loss. We analyzed RADseq data with multispecies coalescent (MSC) species delimitation methods for three named species and an undescribed lineage previously identified to have divergent mtDNA. Marked differences in effective population sizes, levels of gene flow, patterns of isolation-by-distance, and species delimitation results were found among them. Whereas all tests support the recognition of the presently undescribed lineage as a separate species, the species-level distinction of two previously described species, M. mittermeieri and M. lehilahytsara is not supported - a result that is particularly striking when using the genealogical discordance index (gdi). Non-sister lineages occur sympatrically in two of the localities sampled for this study, despite an estimated divergence time of less than 1 Ma. This suggests rapid evolution of reproductive isolation in the focal lineages, and in the mouse lemur clade generally. The divergence time estimates reported here are based on the MSC and calibrated with pedigree-based mutation rates and are considerably more recent than previously published fossil-calibrated concatenated likelihood estimates, however. We discuss the possible explanations for this discrepancy, noting that there are theoretical justifications for preferring the MSC estimates in this case.",

    "abstract": "Indigenous peoples have occupied the island of Puerto Rico since at least 3000 B.C. Due to the demographic shifts that occurred after European contact, the origin(s) of these ancient populations, and their genetic relationship to present-day islanders, are unclear. We use ancient DNA to characterize the population history and genetic legacies of pre-contact Indigenous communities from Puerto Rico. Bone, tooth and dental calculus samples were collected from 124 individuals from three pre-contact archaeological sites: Tibes, Punta Candelero and Paso del Indio. Despite poor DNA preservation, we used target enrichment and high-throughput sequencing to obtain complete mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) from 45 individuals and autosomal genotypes from two individuals. We found a high proportion of Native American mtDNA haplogroups A2 and C1 in the pre-contact Puerto Rico sample (40% and 44%, respectively). This distribution, as well as the haplotypes represented, support a primarily Amazonian South American origin for these populations, and mirrors the Native American mtDNA diversity patterns found in present-day islanders. Three mtDNA haplotypes from pre-contact Puerto Rico persist among Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean islanders, indicating that present-day populations are reservoirs of pre-contact mtDNA diversity. Lastly, we find similarity in autosomal ancestry patterns between pre-contact individuals from Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, suggesting a shared component of Indigenous Caribbean ancestry with close affinity to South American populations. Our findings contribute to a more complete reconstruction of pre-contact Caribbean population history and explore the role of Indigenous peoples in shaping the biocultural diversity of present-day Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean islanders.",

    "abstract": "Although mRNA is a necessary precursor to protein, several studies have argued that the relationship between mRNA and protein levels is often weak. This claim undermines the functional relevance of conclusions based on quantitative analyses of mRNA levels, which are ubiquitous in modern biology from the single gene to the whole genome scale. Furthermore, if post-translational processes vary between strains and species, then comparative studies based on mRNA alone would miss an important driver of diversity. However, gene expression is dynamic, and most studies examining relationship between mRNA and protein levels at the genome scale have analyzed single timepoints. We measure yeast gene expression after pheromone exposure and show that, for most genes, protein timecourses can be predicted from mRNA timecourses through a simple, gene-specific, generative model. By comparing model parameters and predictions between strains, we find that while mRNA variation often leads to protein differences, evolution also manipulates protein-specific processes to amplify or buffer transcriptional regulation.",

Additionally, we generated a  UAS:RiboTag transgenic line to allow for the study of a wider array of zebrafish cell and tissue types using TRAP-RNAseq methods.

    "abstract": "The relationship between compartmentalisation of the genome and epigenetics is long and hoary. In 1928 Heitz defined heterochromatin as the largest differentiated chromatin compartment in eukaryotic nuclei. Mullers (1930) discovery of position-effect variegation (PEV) went on to show that heterochromatin is a cytologically-visible state of heritable (epigenetic) gene repression. Current insights into compartmentalisation have come from a high-throughput top-down approach where contact frequency (Hi-C) maps revealed the presence of compartmental domains that segregate the genome into heterochromatin and euchromatin. It has been argued that the compartmentalisation seen in Hi-C maps is due to the physiochemical process of phase separation. Oddly, the insights provided by these experimental and conceptual advances have remained largely silent on how Hi-C maps and phase separation relate to epigenetics. Addressing this issue directly in mammals, we have made use of a bottom-up approach starting with the hallmarks of constitutive heterochromatin, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and its binding partner the H3K9me2/3 determinant of the histone code. They are key epigenetic regulators in eukaryotes. Both hallmarks are also found outside mammalian constitutive heterochromatin as constituents of larger (0.1-5Mb) heterochromatin-like domains and smaller (less than 100Kb) complexes. The well-documented ability of HP1 proteins to function as bridges between H3K9me2/3-marked nucleosomes enables cross-linking within and between chromatin fibres that contributes to polymer-polymer phase separation (PPPS) that packages epigenetically-heritable chromatin states during interphase. Contacts mediated by HP1 \\\"bridging\\\" are likely to have been detected in Hi-C maps, as evidenced by the B4 heterochromatic sub-compartment that emerges from contacts between large KRAB-ZNF heterochromatin-like domains. Further, mutational analyses have revealed a finer, innate, compartmentalisation in Hi-C experiments that likely reflect contacts involving smaller domains/complexes. Proteins that bridge (modified) DNA and histones in nucleosomal fibres - where the HP1-H3K9me2/3 interaction represents the most evolutionarily-conserved paradigm - could drive and generate the fundamental compartmentalisation of the interphase nucleus. This has implications for the mechanism(s) that maintains cellular identity, be it a terminally-differentiated fibroblast or a pluripotent embryonic stem cell.",

We demonstrated that our ROGUE metric is generalizable across datasets, and enables accurate, sensitive and robust assessment of cluster purity on a wide range of simulated and real datasets. Applying this metric to fibroblast and B cell datasets, we identified additional subtypes and demonstrated the application of ROGUE-guided analyses to detect true signals in specific subpopulations.

    "abstract": "Hundreds of loci have been associated with blood pressure traits from many genome-wide association studies. We identified an enrichment of these loci in aorta and tibial artery expression quantitative trait loci in our previous work in [~]100,000 Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) study participants. In the present study, we subsequently focused on determining putative regulatory regions for these and other tissues of relevance to blood pressure, to both fine-map these loci by pinpointing genes and variants of functional interest within them, and to identify any novel genes.\\n\\nWe constructed maps of putative cis-regulatory elements using publicly available open chromatin data for the heart, aorta and tibial arteries, and multiple kidney cell types. Sequence variants within these regions may be evaluated quantitatively for their tissue- or cell-type-specific regulatory impact using deltaSVM functional scores, as described in our previous work. In order to identify genes of interest, we aggregate these variants in these putative cis-regulatory elements within 50Kb of the start or end of genes considered as \\\"expressed\\\" in these tissues or cell types using publicly available gene expression data, and use the deltaSVM scores as weights in the well-known group-wise sequence kernel association test (SKAT). We test for association with both blood pressure traits as well as expression within these tissues or cell types of interest, and identify several genes, including MTHFR, C10orf32, CSK, NOV, ULK4, SDCCAG8, SCAMP5, RPP25, HDGFRP3, VPS37B, and PPCDC. Although our study centers on blood pressure traits, we additionally examined two known genes, SCN5A and NOS1AP involved in the cardiac trait QT interval, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), as a positive control, and observed an expected heart-specific effect. Thus, our method may be used to identify variants and genes for further functional testing using tissue- or cell-type-specific putative regulatory information.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySequence change in genes (\\\"variants\\\") are linked to the presence and severity of different traits or diseases. However, as genes may be expressed in different tissues and at different times and degrees, using this information is expected to more accurately identify genes of interest. Variants within the genes are essential, but also in the sequences (\\\"regulatory elements\\\") that control the genes expression in different tissues or cell types. In this study, we aim to use this information about expression and variants potentially involved in gene expression regulation to better pinpoint genes and variants in regulatory elements of interest for blood pressure regulation. We do so by taking advantage of such data that are publicly available, and use methods to combine information about variants in aggregate within a genes putative regulatory elements in tissues thought to be relevant for blood pressure, and identify several genes, meant to enable experimental follow-up.",
