    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a central role in regulating various developmental and biological processes. The expression of miRNAs is differentially modulated in response to various stresses. Based on the recent findings, it has been shown that some of the pri-miRNAs encode small regulatory peptides, microRNA-encoded peptides (miPEP). miPEPs are reported to regulate the growth and development of plants by modulating corresponding miRNA expression; however, the role of these peptides in different stresses has not been explored yet. Here, we reported that pri-miR408 encodes a small peptide, miPEP408, that regulates the expression of miR408, its targets, and associated phenotype in Arabidopsis. Plants overexpressing miR408 showed severe sensitivity under low sulphur (LS), Arsenite As(III) and LS+As(III) stress, while miR408 mutant developed through the CRISPR/Cas9 approach showed tolerance. Transgenic lines showed phenotypic alteration and modulation in the expression of genes involved in the sulphur reduction pathway and affect sulphate and glutathione accumulation. Similar to miR408 overexpressing lines, the exogenous application of synthetic miPEP408 or miPEP408 overexpression led to sensitivity in plants under LS, As(III) and combined LS+As(III) stress compared to control. This study suggests the involvement of miR408 and miPEP408 in heavy metal and nutrient deficiency responses.\n\nOne-sentence summarymiR408 and peptide encoded by miR408, miPEP408, regulate arsenic stress and low sulphur responses in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen is an essential element required for plant growth and productivity. Understanding the mechanisms and natural genetic variation underlying nitrogen use in plants will facilitate engineering plant nitrogen use to maximize crop productivity while minimizing environmental costs. To understand the scope of natural variation that may influence nitrogen use, we grew 1135 Arabidopsis thaliana natural genotypes on two nitrogen sources, nitrate and ammonium, and measured both developmental and defense metabolite traits. By using different environments and focused on multiple traits, we identified a wide array of different nitrogen responses. These responses are associated with a large number of genes, most of them not previously associated with nitrogen responses. Only a small portion of these genes appear to be shared between environments or traits while most of the detected genes are predominantly specific to a developmental or defense trait under a specific nitrogen source. Finally, by using a large population we were able to identify unique nitrogen responses, like preferring ammonium or nitrate, that appear to be generated by combinations of loci rather than a few large effect loci. This suggests that it may be possible to obtain novel phenotypes in complex nitrogen responses by manipulating sets of genes with small effects rather than solely focusing on large effect single gene manipulations.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUsing a large collection of natural genotypes, and studying both developmental and metabolic responses, we found a large number of genes that are involved in the plants nitrogen response.",

    "abstract": "Proper plant growth and development requires spatial coordination of cell divisions. Two unrelated microtubule-binding proteins, TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-ROOT-CULTURES9 (AIR9), are together required for normal growth and division-plane orientation in Arabidopsis. tan1 air9 double mutants have synthetic growth and division-plane orientation defects while single mutants lack obvious defects. Here we show that the division-site localized protein, PHRAGMOPLAST-ORIENTING-KINESIN1 (POK1), was aberrantly lost from the division site during metaphase and telophase in tan1 air9 mutants. Since TAN1 and POK1 interact via the first 132 amino acids of TAN1 (TAN11-132), we assessed its localization and function in the tan1 air9 double mutant. TAN11-132 rescued tan1 air9 mutant phenotypes and localized to the division site in telophase. However, replacing six amino-acid residues within TAN11-132 that disrupts POK1-TAN1 interaction in the yeast-two-hybrid system caused loss of both rescue and division-site localization of TAN11-132 in tan1 air9 mutants. Full-length TAN1 with the same alanine substitutions had defects in phragmoplast guidance and reduced TAN1 and POK1 localization at the division site but rescued most tan1 air9 mutant phenotypes. Together, these data suggest that TAN1 and AIR9 are required for POK1 localization, and yet unknown proteins may stabilize TAN1-POK1 interactions.\n\nOne sentence summarySpecific amino acids within TAN1 are required for its correct localization and function partially through interaction with POK1; both TAN1 and AIR9 mediate POK1 division site localization.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is constantly challenged by the presence of contaminant background signals. In particular, protein contaminants from reagents and sample handling are often abundant and almost impossible to avoid. For data-dependent acquisition (DDA) proteomics, exclusion list can be used to reduce the influence of protein contaminants. However, protein contamination has not been evaluated and is rarely addressed in data-independent acquisition (DIA). How protein contaminants influence proteomics data is also unclear. In this study, we established protein contaminant FASTA and spectral libraries that are applicable to all proteomic workflows and evaluated the impact of protein contaminants on both DDA and DIA proteomics. We demonstrated that including our contaminant libraries can reduce false discoveries and increase protein identifications, without influencing the quantification accuracy in various proteomic software platforms. With the pressing need to standardize proteomic workflow in the research community, we highly recommend including our contaminant FASTA and spectral libraries in all bottom-up proteomics workflow. Our contaminant libraries and a step-by-step tutorial to incorporate these libraries in different DDA and DIA data analysis platforms can be valuable resources for proteomics researchers, which are freely accessible at https://github.com/HaoGroup-ProtContLib.",

Performance is better at the fovea, decreases with eccentricity, and is better along the horizontal than vertical meridian and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. However, all neurophysiological and virtually all behavioral studies of cortical magnification have investigated eccentricity effects without considering polar angle. Most performance differences due to eccentricity are eliminated when stimulus size is cortically magnified (M-scaled) to equate the size of its cortical representation in primary visual cortex (V1). But does cortical magnification underlie performance differences around the visual field? Here, to assess contrast sensitivity, human adult observers performed an orientation discrimination task with constant stimulus size at different locations as well as when stimulus size was M-scaled according to stimulus eccentricity and polar angle location. We found that although M-scaling stimulus size eliminates differences across eccentricity, it does not eliminate differences around the polar angle. This finding indicates that limits in contrast sensitivity across eccentricity and around the visual field are mediated by different anatomical and computational constraints.",

The transcription of ENT3 is directly under the regulation of IFN-induced signaling, positioning this metabolite transporter as an Interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Moreover, we unveil that several viruses, including SARS-CoV2, require ENT3 to facilitate their entry into the cytoplasm. The removal or suppression of ENT3 expression is sufficient to significantly decrease viral replication in vitro and in vivo.",

To obtain high-resolution structural information, samples need to be thin to minimize inelastic scattering which blurs images. During data collection sessions, time spent on finding areas on the cryo-EM grid with optimal ice thickness should be minimized as imaging time on high-end Transmission Electron Microscope TEM systems is costly. Recently, grids covered with thin gold films have become popular due to their stability and reduced beam-induced motion of the sample. Gold foil grids have substantially different densities between the gold foil and ice, effectively resulting in the loss of dynamic range between thin and thick regions of ice, making it challenging to find areas with suitable ice thickness efficiently during grid screening and thus increase expensive imaging time. Here, an energy filter-based plasmon imaging is presented as a fast and easy method for grid screening of the gold grids.",

Here, we selectively inhibited Rac and Rho in mouse embryonic fibroblasts cultured on deformable substrata and used RNA sequencing to elucidate and compare the contribution of these GTPases to the early transcriptional response to ECM stiffness. Surprisingly, we found that Rac activation is almost exclusively responsible for the initial transcriptional response to ECM stiffness.

Thus, stabilization of desmosome integrity may provide potential new treatment options. Desmosomes, apart from cellular cohesion, provide the structural framework of a signaling hub. Here, we investigated the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cardiomyocyte cohesion. We inhibited EGFR under physiological and pathophysiological conditions using the murine plakoglobin knockout AC model, in which EGFR was upregulated. EGFR inhibition enhanced cardiomyocyte cohesion. Immunoprecipitation showed an interaction of EGFR and desmoglein 2 (DSG2). Immunostaining and AFM revealed enhanced DSG2 localization and binding at cell borders upon EGFR inhibition. Enhanced area composita length and desmosome assembly were observed upon EGFR inhibition, confirmed by enhanced DSG2 and desmoplakin (DP) recruitment to cell borders. Erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, activated ROCK. Erlotinib mediated desmosome assembly and cardiomyocyte cohesion were abolished upon ROCK inhibition. Thus, inhibiting EGFR, thereby stabilizing desmosome integrity, might provide new treatment options for AC.\n\nSummaryShoykhet et al. show that EGFR inhibition led ROCK activation enhances cardiomyocyte cohesion via enhanced desmosomal assembly which is evidenced by enhanced DP/DSG2 localization at cell borders.

    "abstract": "Wastewater treatment plant effluents can impact microbial communities in receiving streams. However, little is known about the role of microorganisms in wastewater as opposed to other wastewater constituents, such as nutrients and micropollutants. We aimed therefore at determining the impact of wastewater microorganisms on the microbial diversity and function of periphyton, key microbial communities in streams. Periphyton was grown in flow-through channels that were continuously alimented with a mixture of stream water and unfiltered or ultra-filtered wastewater. Impacts were assessed on periphyton biomass, activities and tolerance to micropollutants, as well as on microbial diversity. Our results showed that wastewater microorganisms colonized periphyton and modified its community composition, resulting for instance in an increased abundance of Chloroflexi and a decreased abundance of diatoms and green algae. This led to shifts towards heterotrophy, as suggested by the changes in nutrient stoichiometry and the increased mineralization potential of carbon substrates. An increased tolerance towards micropollutants was only found for periphyton exposed to unfiltered wastewater but not to ultra-filtered wastewater, suggesting that wastewater microorganisms were responsible for this increased tolerance. Overall, our results highlight the need to consider the role of wastewater microorganisms when studying potential impacts of wastewater on the receiving water body.\n\nEnvironmental implicationThe present study investigates the impact of wastewater microorganisms on periphyton, i.e. communities forming the microbial skin of streambeds. We were able to disentangle specific effects of wastewater microorganisms in the context of the complex wastewater matrix. Indeed, wastewater microorganisms induced strong changes in periphyton community composition and function, suggesting the need to consider wastewater microbial communities as a stressor per se, similarly to, e.g., nutrients and micropollutants. Moreover, since periphyton is at the basis of the food web in streams, these changes may have consequences for higher trophic levels.",

    "abstract": "Carbon and nitrogen are the two most abundant nutrients in all living things, and their metabolism maintains normal plant growth. However, the molecular mechanism underlying carbon and nitrogen metabolism remains largely unknown. Here, we found that HSP90.6 is involved in the metabolism of carbon and nitrogen. We performed gene cloning and functional characterization of a maize EMS mutant ehsp90.6, whose kernels were small. HSP90.6 encodes heat shock protein 90.6, which has a single-amino acid mutation within its HATPase_c domain. Transcriptome profiling showed that the expression of amino acid biosynthesis- and carbon metabolism-related genes was significantly downregulated in hsp90.6. HSP90.6 is involved in the 26S proteasome degradation pathway, which affects nitrogen recycling to regulate amino acid synthesis; this occurs by interactions between HSP90.6 and the 26S proteasome subunits RPN6 and PBD2 (PRC2). The loss of HSP90.6 significantly reduced the activity of the 26S proteasome, resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and defects in nitrogen recycling. Moreover, HSP90.6 interacted with the 14-3-3 protein GF14-6 to participate in carbon metabolism.

To identify new genes involved in maize grain filling, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) was used to induce mutations, and the ehsp90.6 mutant, which exhibited abnormal kernel development, was isolated by bulked segregant analysis RNA sequencing (BSR).\n\nQuestionWhy does the single-amino acid mutation of HSP90.6 affect grain size, and how does the loss of HSP90.6 affect grain filling?\n\nFindingsA single-amino acid mutant (ehsp90.6) and knockout mutant (hsp90.6) were obtained. We found that HSP90-6 was involved in the regulation of maize grain filling. A single-single amino acid mutation in the HATPase_c domain reduced the ATPase activity of HSP90.6, resulting in smaller grains. The functional loss of HSP90.6 resulted in the expression of amino acid biosynthesis- and carbon metabolism-related genes being significantly downregulated in hsp90.6. We indicated that HSP90.6 is involved in the 26S proteasome degradation pathway, which affects nitrogen recycling to regulate amino acid synthesis by interacting with the 26S proteasome subunits RPN6 and PBD2 (PRC2). Moreover, HSP90.6 was found to interact with the 14-3-3 protein GF14-6 to participate in carbon metabolism.\n\nNext stepsTo further verify that the interaction between HSP90.6 and 26S proteasome subunits and GF14-6 affects grain filling, knockout validation of RPN6, PBD2 (PRC2) and GF14-6 will be performed. In addition, since GF14-6 interacts with the phosphorylated proteins, we will determine the phosphorylation site of HSP90.6. Due to the important role of HSP90 family proteins in plant development, there are other regulatory pathways that need to be explored.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline with age is associated with brain atrophy and reduced brain activations, but the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are unclear, especially in deeper brain structures primarily affected by healthy aging or neurodegenerative processes. Here, we characterize time-resolved, resting-state magnetoencephalography activity of the hippocampus and subcortical brain regions in a large cohort of healthy young and older volunteers from the Cam-CAN open repository. The data show age-related changes in both rhythmic and arrhythmic signal strength and temporal variability in multiple deeper brain regions, including the hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. We observe a slowing of neural activity in deeper brain regions, which echoes previous reports of cortical slowing. We also report reduced occipito-parietal alpha peak associated with increased theta-band activity and signal variability in the hippocampus, an effect that may reflect compensatory processes as theta activity and variability were more strongly expressed when cognitive performances are preserved. Overall, this study advances the understanding of the biological nature of inter-individual variability in aging. The data provide new insight of how hippocampus and subcortical neurophysiological activity evolve with biological age, and highlight frequency-specific effects associated with cognitive decline vs. cognitive maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Rod photoreceptor degeneration causes deterioration in the morphology and physiology of cone photoreceptors along with changes in retinal circuits. These changes could diminish visual signaling at cone-mediated light levels, thereby limiting the efficacy of treatments such as gene therapy for rescuing normal, cone-mediated vision. However, the impact of progressive rod death on cone-mediated signaling remains unclear. A mouse model of rod degeneration was used to investigate the fidelity of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) signaling throughout disease progression. Despite clear deterioration of cone morphology with rod death, cone-mediated signaling among RGCs remained surprisingly robust: spatiotemporal receptive fields changed little and the mutual information between stimuli and spiking responses was relatively constant. This relative stability held until nearly all rods had died and cones had completely lost well-formed outer segments. Interestingly, RGC information rates were higher and more stable for natural movies than checkerboard noise as degeneration progressed. The main change in RGC responses with photoreceptor degeneration was a decrease in response gain. These results suggest that gene therapies for rod degenerative diseases are likely to successfully prolong cone-mediated vision even if there are changes to cone morphology and density.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection results in wide-ranging disease manifestation from asymptomatic to potentially lethal. Infection poses an increased threat of severity to at-risk populations including those with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), is characterized, in part, by insulin insensitivity and impaired glucose regulation. T2DM patients have increased disease severity and poorer outcomes with COVID-19. We utilized the diet-induced obesity (DIO) model of Type 2 Diabetes in SARS-CoV-2-susceptible K18-hACE2 transgenic mice to better understand the obesity co-morbidity. Female DIO, but not male DIO mice challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were observed to have shortened time to morbidity compared to normal diet mice. Increase in susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 in female DIO was associated with increased total viral RNA burden compared to male mice. RNAseq analysis was performed on the lungs of non-challenged, challenged, females, males, of either normal diet or DIO cohorts to determine the disease specific transcriptional profiles. DIO female mice had more total activated genes than normal diet mice after challenge; however, male mice experienced a decrease. GO term analysis revealed the DIO condition increased interferon response signatures and interferon gamma production following challenge. Male challenged mice had robust expression of antibody-related genes suggesting antibody producing cell localization in the lung. DIO reduced antibody gene expression in challenged males. Collectively this study establishes a preclinical T2DM/obesity co-morbidity model of COVID-19 in mice where we observed sex and diet specific responses that begin to explain the effects of obesity and diabetes on COVID-19 disease.",

Resistance to vaccination and limitations in the current treatments available require the ongoing development of therapies especially for those with severe disease. The plant lectin Galanthus nivalis binds to mannose structures in the viral envelope. We hypothesized that viral binding should be unaffected by spike protein mutations.

    "abstract": "The essential function of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in mediating transcriptional response to xenobiotic and oxidative stimuli has been well established. However, the mechanisms whereby Keap1 and Nrf2 regulate developmental genes remains unclear. We hypothesized that Drosophila Keap1 (dKeap1) and Nrf2 (CncC) proteins regulate transcription through controlling high-order chromatin structure. Here, we describe evidence supporting that dKeap1 can regulate chromatin through interaction with lamin, the intermediate filament proteins that form nuclear lamina and organize the overall chromatin architecture. dKeap1 and lamin Dm0, the B-type lamin in Drosophila, interact with each other and form complexes in the nucleus. Overexpression of dKeap1 resulted in a redistribution of lamin Dm0 to the intra-nuclear area and consistently, caused a spreading of the heterochromatin marker H3K9me2 from the pericentromeric region to chromosome arms. Overexpression of dKeap1 fusion proteins in the dKeap1 null background significantly disrupted the nuclear lamina morphology, indicating that dKeap1 is required for the maintenance of a normal nuclear lamina. Knock down of dKeap1 partially rescued the lethality caused by lamin Dm0 overexpression, suggesting that dKeap1 and lamin Dm0 function in the same pathway during development. Taken together, these results support a model where dKeap1 regulates chromatin structure and developmental transcription through interaction with lamin proteins, revealing a novel epigenetic function of the Keap1 oxidative/xenobiotic response factor.",

    "abstract": "Following a whole genome duplication (WGD) event approximately 100 million years ago, the yeast lineage from which the model Saccharomyces cerevisiae derives maintained two copies of genes where it was necessary to synthesise proteoforms with different sub-cellular localisation. In contrast, yeasts that did not undergo the WGD event have a single gene that must encode both proteoforms. We adopted an integrated in silico and experimental approach to study how this is achieved with BAT1, a gene that encodes mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of a branched chain aminotransferase (BCAT) in pre-WGD yeast such as Kluyveromyces marxianus. We determined that condition-specific regulation of alternative transcription sites gives rise to mRNA isoforms that differ at the 5end and that, when decoded, generate a mitochondrial or cytosolic proteoform. Furthermore, targeted mutants lacking specific transcription factors were generated to establish how this differentiation was regulated. As in S. cerevisiae, Gcn4 and Leu3 activated expression of the mRNA encoding the mitochondrial proteoform under conditions when branched chain amino acid synthesis was required. Unlike S. cerevisiae, however, K. marxianus lacked tight regulation of the mRNA encoding the cytosolic proteoform supporting the hypothesis that maintaining paralogous genes in post-WGD yeasts facilitated development of more sophisticated expression control mechanisms.",

Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the AnkG in complex with a fragment from Nfasc cytoplasmic tail that shows, in conjunction with binding affinity assays, the molecular basis of AnkG-Nfasc binding. We confirm AnkG interacts with the FIGQY motif in Nfasc, and identify another region required for their high affinity binding. Structural analysis revealed that ANK repeats form four hydrophobic or hydrophilic layers in the AnkG inner groove that coordinate interactions with Nfasc. Moreover, disruption of the AnkG-Nfasc complex abolishes Nfasc enrichment at the AIS in hippocampal neurons. Finally, structural and biochemical analysis indicated that L1 syndrome-associated mutations in L1CAM compromise binding with ankyrins.

As the wealth of bioactivity data accumulates, it provides opportunities for the development of deep learning (DL) models with increasing predictive powers. Conventionally, such models were either limited to the use of very simplified representations of proteins or ineffective voxelization of their 3D structures. Herein, we present the development of the PSG-BAR (Protein Structure Graph -Binding Affinity Regression) approach that utilizes 3D structural information of the proteins along with 2D graph representations of ligands. The method also introduces attention scores to selectively weight protein regions that are most important for ligand binding.\n\nResultsThe developed approach demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on several binding affinity benchmarking datasets. The attention-based pooling of protein graphs enables identification of surface residues as critical residues for protein-ligand binding. Finally, we validate our model predictions against an experimental assay on a viral main protease (Mpro)- the hallmark target of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.\n\nAvailabilityThe code for PSG-BAR is made available at https://github.com/diamondspark/PSG-BAR\n\nContactacherkasov@prostatecentre.com",

We evaluated the proposed methods results by analysing ST datasets available on the 10x Genomics website and comparing clustering performances with state-of-the-art approaches by measuring the spots stability in the clusters and their biological coherence.

In subalpine Abies veitchii trees, the fraction of closed pits and embolized tracheids as well as conductivity losses were measured to examine pit aspiration and its effects, triggered by natural and artificial stem freezing. When trees incurred mild drought stress in February and early March, 70% to 80% of stem conductivity was lost. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy indicated <20% embolized tracheids but [~]90% closed pits. Severe drought stress in late March caused 96 {+/-} 1.2% (mean {+/-} SE) loss of stem conductivity, while the fraction of embolized tracheids increased to 64 {+/-} 6.6%, and aspirated pit fraction decreased to 23 {+/-} 5.6%. Experimental freeze-thaw cycles also induced from 7.1 {+/-} 0.89% to 49 {+/-} 10% pit aspiration, and the fraction of closed pits was positively correlated to the percent loss of stem hydraulic conductivity.

This research model is wet-dry-wet; it originated in genomic sequencing laboratories, evolved to computational modeling, and the candidate result now require validation back in a wet lab.\n\nObjectivesThis studys purpose was to test the hypothesis that machine learning applied to sequenced coronaviruses genomes could identify which amino acid substitutions likely attenuate the viruses to produce a safe and effective pan-coronavirus vaccine candidate. This candidate is now eligible to be pre-clinically then clinically tested and proven. If validated, it would constitute a traditional attenuated virus vaccine to protect against hundreds of coronaviruses, including the many future variants of SARS-CoV-2 predicted from continuously recombining in unvaccinated populations and spreading by modern mass travel.\n\nMethodsUsing machine learning, this was an in silico comparative effectiveness research study on trinucleotide functions in nonstructural proteins of 365 novel coronavirus genomes. Sequences of 7,097 codons in the ORF1ab gene were collected from 65 global locations infecting 68 species and reported to the US National Institute of Health. The data were proprietarily transformed twice to enable machine learning ingestion, mapping, and interpretation. The set of 2,590,405 data points was randomly divided into three cohorts: 255 (70%) observations for training; and two cohorts of 55 (15%) observations each for testing. Machine learning models were trained in the statistical programming language R and compared to identify which mixture of the 7.097 x 1023 possible amino-acid-location combinations would attenuate SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that have infected humans.\n\nResultsContests of machine-learning algorithms identified nine amino-acid point substitutions in the ORF1ab gene that likely attenuate 98.98% of 365 (361) novel coronaviruses. Notably, seven substitutions are for the amino acid alanine. Most of the locations (5 of 9) are in nonstructural proteins (NSPs) 2 and 3. The substitutions are alanine to (1) valine at codon 4273; (2) leucine at codon 5077; (3) phenylalanine at codon 2001; (4) leucine at codon 372; (5) proline at codon 354; (6) phenylalanine at codon 2811; (7) phenylalanine at codon 4703; (8) leucine to serine at codon 2333; and, (9) threonine to alanine at codon 5131.\n\nConclusionsThe primary outcome is a new, highly promising, pan-coronavirus vaccine candidate based on nine amino-acid substitutions in the ORF1ab gene. The secondary outcome was evidence that sequences of wet-dry lab collaborations - here machine learning analysis of viral genomes informing codon functions -- may discover new broader and more stable vaccines candidates more quickly and inexpensively than traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Based on analyses of TCR sequences from over 1,000 individuals, we report that the TCR repertoire is composed of two ontogenically and functionally distinct types of TCRs. Their production is regulated by variations in thymic output and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT) activity. Neonatal TCRs derived from TDT-negative progenitors persist throughout life, are highly shared among subjects, and are polyreactive to self and microbial antigens. Thus, >50% of cord blood TCRs are responsive to SARS-CoV2 and other common pathogens. TDT- dependent TCRs present distinct structural features and are less shared among subjects. TDT- dependent TCRs are produced in maximal numbers during infancy when thymic output and TDT activity reach a summit, are more abundant in subjects with AIRE mutations, and seem to play a dominant role in graft-versus-host disease. Factors decreasing thymic output (age, male sex) negatively impact TCR diversity. Males compensate for their lower repertoire diversity via hyperexpansion of selected TCR clonotypes.",

    "abstract": "T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are specialized CD4+ T cells that regulate humoral immunity by providing B cell help. Tfh1 sub-population was recently identified and associated with severity in infection and autoimmune diseases. The cellular and molecular requirements to induce human Tfh1 differentiation are unknown. Our work investigated the role of human dendritic cells (DC) in promoting Tfh1 differentiation and their physiopathological implication in mycobacterium tuberculosis and mild COVID-19 infection.\n\nActivated human blood CD1c+ DC were cocultured with allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing was then used alongside protein validation to define the induced Tfh lineage. DC signature and correlation with Tfh1 cells in infected patients was established through bioinformatic analysis.\n\nOur results show that GM-CSF-activated DC drove the differentiation of Tfh1 cells, displaying typical Tfh molecular features, including 1) high levels of PD-1, CXCR5, and ICOS expression; 2) BCL6 and TBET co-expression; 3) IL-21 and IFN-{gamma} secretion. Mechanistically, GM-CSF triggered the emergence of two distinct DC sub-populations defined by their differential expression of CD40 and ICOS-ligand (ICOS-L), and distinct phenotype, morphology, transcriptomic signature, and function. We showed that Tfh1 differentiation was efficiently and specifically induced by CD40highICOS-Llow DC in a CD40-dependent manner. Tfh1 cells were positively associated with a CD40highICOS-LLow DC signature in patients with latent mycobacterium tuberculosis and mild COVID-19 infection.\n\nOur study uncovers a novel CD40-dependent human Tfh1 axis. Immunotherapy modulation of Tfh1 activity might contribute to control diseases where Tfh1 are known to play a key role, such as infections.\n\nSignificance StatementDendritic cells (DC) play a central role in triggering the adaptive immune response due to their T cell priming functions. Among different T cell subsets, it is still not clear how human type1 T follicular helper cells (Tfh1) differentiate. Tfh1 cells are implicated in several physiopathological conditions, including infections. Here we show that GM-CSF induces diversification of human DC. Only CD40highICOS-LLow DC were able to drive Tfh1 cell differentiation. We found that CD40highICOS-LLow DC signature was associated to Tfh1 cells in mycobacterium tuberculosis and COVID-19 patients. Our data reveal a previously undescribed pathway leading to human Tfh1 cell differentiation and highlight the importance of GM-CSF and CD40 as potential targets for the design of anti-infective therapies.",

We have characterized structural, functional and antigenic properties of the full-length BA.2 spike (S) protein and compared replication of the authentic virus in cell culture and animal model with previously prevalent variants. BA.2 S can fuse membranes more efficiently than Omicron BA.1, mainly due to lack of a BA.1-specific mutation that may retard the receptor engagement, but still less efficiently than other variants. Both BA.1 and BA.2 viruses replicated substantially faster in animal lungs than the early G614 (B.1) strain in the absence of pre-existing immunity, possibly explaining the increased transmissibility despite their functionally compromised spikes. As in BA.1, mutations in the BA.2 S remodel its antigenic surfaces leading to strong resistance to neutralizing antibodies. These results suggest that both immune evasion and replicative advantage may contribute to the heightened transmissibility for the Omicron subvariants.",

    "abstract": "Variant of concern (VOC) Omicron-BA1 has achieved global predominance in early 2022. Therefore, surveillance and comprehensive characterization of Omicron-BA.1 in advanced primary cell culture systems and multiple animal models is urgently needed. Here, we characterized Omicron-BA.1 and recombinant Omicron-BA.1 spike gene mutants in comparison with VOC Delta in well-differentiated primary human nasal and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, followed by in vivo fitness characterization in naive hamsters, ferrets and hACE2-expressing mice, and in immunized hACE2-mice. We demonstrate a spike-mediated enhancement of early replication of Omicron-BA.1 in nasal epithelial cultures, but limited replication in bronchial epithelial cultures. In Syrian hamsters, Delta showed dominance over Omicron-BA.1 and in ferrets, Omicron-BA.1 infection was abortive. In mice expressing the authentic hACE2-receptor, Delta and a Delta spike clone also showed dominance over Omicron-BA.1 and an Omicron-BA.1 spike clone, respectively. Interestingly, in naive K18-hACE2 mice, we observed Delta spike-mediated increased replication and pathogenicity and Omicron-BA.1 spike-mediated reduced replication and pathogenicity, suggesting that the spike gene is a major determinant of both Delta and Omicron-BA.1 replication and pathogenicity. Finally, the Omicron-BA.1 spike clone was less well controlled by mRNA-vaccination in K18-hACE2-mice and became more competitive compared to the progenitor and Delta spike clones, suggesting that spike gene-mediated immune evasion is another important factor that led to Omicron-BA.1 dominance.",

These network deficits are mediated by early alterations in neuronal firing rates that coincide with amyloid plaque accumulation. Mounting evidence supports that inhibitory networks are impaired in AD, but the mechanisms driving these inhibitory deficits are poorly understood. Here we use in vivo multiphoton calcium imaging to determine the relationship between amyloid accumulation and the spontaneous activity of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimers disease. We show that somatostatin-expressing (SOM) interneurons are hyperactive, while parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are hypoactive in APP/PS1 mice. Only SOM interneuron hyperactivity correlated with proximity to amyloid plaque. These inhibitory deficits were accompanied by decreased excitatory neurons activity and decreased pairwise activity correlations in APP/PS1 mice. Our study identifies cell-specific interneuronal firing deficits driven by amyloid pathology in APP/PS1 mice and provides new insights for targeting inhibitory circuits in Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Sensory systems are dynamically adjusted according to the animals ongoing needs by neuromodulators, such as neuropeptides. Although many neuropeptides are often widely-distributed throughout sensory networks, it is unclear whether such neuropeptides uniformly modulate network activity. Here, we leverage the numerically tractable primary olfactory center of Drosophila (the antennal lobe, AL) to resolve whether one such widely-distributed neuropeptide (myoinhibitory peptide, MIP) uniformly modulates AL processing. We find that despite being uniformly distributed across the AL, MIP decreases olfactory input to some glomeruli, while simultaneously increasing olfactory input to other glomeruli. We reveal that a heterogeneous ensemble of local interneurons (LNs) are the sole source of MIP within the AL. Through high-resolution connectomic analyses, as well as in vivo physiology, we find that the non-uniform effects of MIP are not likely due to MIPergic LN intrinsic properties (e.g., synaptic inputs/outputs, odor-evoked responses, etc.). Instead, we show that differential expression of the inhibitory MIP receptor (sex peptide receptor, SPR) across glomeruli allows MIP to act on distinct intraglomerular substrates, thus enabling differential modulation of olfactory input. Our findings demonstrate how even a seemingly simple case of modulation (i.e., a single neuropeptide acting through a single receptor) can have complex consequences on network processing by acting non-uniformly within different components of the overall network.",

    "abstract": "It is not clear if the bacterial strains which comprise our microbiota are mostly long-term colonizers or transient residents. Studies have demonstrated decades long persistence of bacterial strains within the gut, but persistence at other body sites has yet to be determined. The vaginal microbiota (VMB) is often dominated by Lactobacillus, although it is also commonly comprised of a more diverse set of other facultative and obligate anaerobes. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that these communities can be stable over several menstrual cycles or can fluctuate temporally in species composition. We sought to determine whether the bacterial strains which comprise the VMB were capable of persisting over longer time-periods. We performed shotgun metagenomics on paired samples from 10 participants collected 1 and 2 years apart. The resulting sequences were de novo assembled and binned into high-quality metagenome assembled genomes. Persistent strains were identified based on the sequence similarity between the genomes present at the two timepoints and were found in the VMB of six of the participants, three of which had multiple. The VMB of the remaining four participants was similar in species composition at the two timepoints but was comprised of different strains. For the persistent strains, we were able to identify the mutations which fixed in the populations over the observed time period, giving insight into the evolution of these bacteria. These results indicate that bacterial strains can persist in the vagina for extended periods of time, providing an opportunity for them to evolve in the host microenvironment.\n\nImportanceThe persistence of strains within the vaginal microbiota has not yet been characterized. Should these strains be capable of persisting for extended periods of time, they could evolve within their host in response to selective pressures exerted by the host or by other members of the community. Here, we present preliminary findings which demonstrate that bacterial strains can persist in the vagina for at least one year and evolve over time. In several cases, multiple strains persisted together in a community, indicating that co-evolution between bacterial strains could occur in the vagina. Our observations motivate future studies which collect samples from more participants, at more timepoints and over even longer periods of time. Understanding which strains persist, what factors drive their persistence, and what selective pressures they face will inform the development and delivery of rationally designed live biotherapeutics for the vagina.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative gastrointestinal pathogen responsible for the diarrheal disease cholera. Expression of key virulence factors, cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus, is regulated indirectly by two single-pass membrane-localized transcription regulators (MLTR), ToxR and TcpP, that promote expression of the transcription activator toxT. TcpP abundance and activity are controlled by TcpH, a single-pass transmembrane protein, which protects TcpP from a two-step proteolytic process known as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). The mechanism of TcpH mediated protection of TcpP represents a major gap in our understanding of V. cholerae pathogenesis. Absence of tcpH leads to unimpeded degradation of TcpP in vitro and a colonization defect in a neonate mouse model of V. cholerae colonization. Here, we show that TcpH protects TcpP from RIP via direct interaction. We also demonstrate that a dietary fatty acid, -linolenic acid, promotes TcpH-dependent inhibition of RIP via co-association of TcpP and TcpH molecules within detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs; also known as lipid rafts) in a mechanism requiring the TcpH transmembrane domain. Taken together our data support a model where V. cholerae cells use exogenous -linolenic acid to remodel the phospholipid bilayer in vivo, leading to co-association of TcpP and TcpH within DRMs where RIP of TcpP is inhibited by TcpH, thereby promoting V. cholerae pathogenicity.\n\nSignificance StatementV. cholerae continues to pose a significant global burden on health infection millions of people every year resulting in [~]100,000 deaths annually. The importance of toxT gene expression in V. cholerae pathogenesis has been well established. Our results show that TcpP, one of the major regulators of toxT gene expression, is protected from proteolysis by TcpH, via direct interaction, in the presence of -linolenic acid, an essential dietary fatty acid. Here we identify a physiological relevant host factor that stimulates V. cholerae pathogenicity via TcpH-dependent antagonism of TcpP proteolysis.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial stress response signaling systems, like the Rcs system, can be triggered by membrane and cell wall damaging compounds including antibiotics and innate immune system factors. These regulatory systems help bacteria survive envelope stress by altering the transcriptome resulting in protective phenotypic changes that may also the influence the virulence of the bacterium. This study investigated the role of the Rcs stress response system using a clinical keratitis isolate of S. marcescens with a mutation in the gumB gene. GumB, an IgaA ortholog, inhibits activation of the Rcs system, such that mutants have overactive Rcs signaling. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that approximately 15% of all S. marcescens genes were significantly altered with two-fold or greater changes in expression in the {Delta}gumB mutant compared to the wild type indicating a global transcriptional regulatory role for GumB. We further investigated the phenotypic consequences of two classes of genes with altered expression in the {Delta}gumB mutant expected to contribute to infections: serralysin metalloproteases PrtS, SlpB and SlpE, and type I pili coded by fimABCD. Secreted fractions from the {Delta}gumB mutant had reduced cytotoxicity to a corneal cell line, and could be complemented by induced expression of prtS, but not cytolysin shlBA, phospholipase phlAB, or flagellar master regulator flhDC operons. Proteomic analysis, qRT-PCR, and type I pili dependent yeast agglutination indicated an inhibitory role for the Rcs system in adhesin production. Together these data demonstrate that GumB and the Rcs stress response system control S. marcescens virulence factors beyond the ShlA cytolysin.\n\nIMPORTANCEPrevious studies indicate that the bacterial Rcs system is a key regulator of envelope stress. This study demonstrated that activation of the Rcs system had a global impact on the transcriptome of a clinical isolate of S. marcescens including decreased expression of cytotoxic serralysin metalloproteases and biofilm promoting type I pili. These results give mechanistic insight into how the Rcs system contributes to pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal barrier derangement allows intestinal bacteria and their products to translocate to the systemic circulation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) superimposed infection in critically ill patients increases gut permeability and leads to gut-driven sepsis. PA infections are challenging due to multi-drug resistance (MDR), biofilms, and/or antibiotic tolerance. Inhibition of the quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator MvfR(PqsR) is a desirable anti-PA strategy as MvfR controls multiple acute and chronic virulence functions. Here we show that MvfR promotes intestinal permeability and report novel potent anti-MvfR compounds, the N-Aryl Malonamides (NAMs) resulting from extensive structure-activity-relationship studies and thorough assessment of the inhibition of MvfR-controlled virulence functions. This novel class of anti-virulence non-native ligand-based agents has a half-maximal inhibitory concentration in the nanomolar range and strong target engagement. Using a NAM lead in monotherapy protects murine intestinal barrier function, abolishes MvfR-regulated small molecules, ameliorates bacterial dissemination, and lowers inflammatory cytokines. This study demonstrates the importance of MvfR in PA-driven intestinal permeability. It underscores the utility of anti-MvfR agents in maintaining gut mucosal integrity, which should be part of any successful strategy to prevent/treat PA infections and associated gut-derived sepsis in critical illness settings. NAMs provide for the development of crucial preventive/therapeutic monotherapy options against untreatable MDR PA infections.",

    "abstract": "Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) may be most important in methanogenic environments, but studies to date that have examined the mechanisms for electron transfer from electron-donating partners have primarily focused on co-cultures in which fumarate was the terminal electron acceptor. To better understand DIET with methanogens, the transcriptome of Geobacter metallireducens during DIET-based growth with Geobacter sulfurreducens reducing fumarate was compared with the transcriptome of G. metallireducens grown in co-culture with diverse Methanosarcina species. The transcriptome of G. metallireducens co-cultured with G. sulfurreducens was significantly different from those with Methanosarcina. Furthermore, the transcriptome of G. metallireducens grown with Methanosarcina barkeri, which lacks outer-surface cytochromes, was different from the transcriptome of G. metallireducens co-cultured with Methanosarcina acetivorans or Methanosarcina subterranea, which have an outer-surface c-type cytochrome that serves as an electrical connect for DIET. Differences in G. metallireducens expression patterns for c-type cytochrome genes were particularly notable. The impact of deleting G. metallireducens c-type cytochrome genes depended upon the electron-accepting partner. Multiple cytochromes that G. metallireducens required for DIET with G. sulfurreducens and for Fe(III) oxide reduction were not required for DIET with the Methanosarcina species. Porin-cytochrome complexes and e-pili were required for optimal DIET with all partners. Shewanella oneidensis, another electroactive microbe with abundant outer-surface c-type cytochromes, did not grow via DIET. The results demonstrate that the presence of outer-surface cytochromes does not necessarily confer the capacity for DIET, and also emphasize the substantial impact of the physiology of the electron-accepting partner on the physiology of the electron-donating DIET partner.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella spp. commonly cause both uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and recurrent UTI (rUTI). Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, a relatively newly defined species of Klebsiella, has been shown to be metabolically distinct from Klebsiella pneumoniae, but its urovirulence mechanisms have not been defined. K. pneumoniae uses both type 1 and type 3 fimbriae to attach to host epithelial cells. The type 1 fimbrial operon is well-conserved between Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae with the exception of fimK, which is unique to Klebsiella spp. FimK contains an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a C-terminal phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain that has been hypothesized to cross-regulate type 3 fimbriae expression via modulation of cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP. Here, we find that a conserved premature stop codon in K. quasipneumoniae fimK results in truncation of the C-terminal PDE domain and that the bladder epithelial cell association and invasion of uropathogenic K. quasipneumoniae strain KqPF9 is dependent on type 3 but not type 1 fimbriae. Further, we show that basal expression of both type 1 and type 3 fimbrial operons as well as bladder epithelial cell association is elevated in KqPF9 relative to uropathogenic K. pneumoniae TOP52 and that complementation of KqPF9{Delta}fimK with the TOP52 fimK allele reduced type 3 fimbrial expression and bladder epithelial cell attachment. Taken together these data suggest that the C-terminal PDE of FimK can modulate type 3 fimbrial expression in K. pneumoniae and its absence in K. quasipneumoniae may lead to a loss of type 3 fimbrial cross-regulation.\n\nImportanceK. quasipneumoniae is often indicated as the cause of many opportunistic infections including urinary tract infection (UTI), which affects >50% of women worldwide. However, virulence mechanisms of K. quasipneumoniae remain uninvestigated. Prior to this work, K. quasipneumoniae and K. pneumoniae had only been distinguished phenotypically by metabolic differences. This work contributes to the understanding of K. quasipneumoniae virulence phenotypes by evaluating the contribution of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, which are critical colonization factors encoded by all Klebsiella spp., to K. quasipneumoniae bladder epithelial cell attachment. We identify clear phenotypic differences in both bladder epithelial cell attachment between uropathogenic K. pneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae. Importantly, we find that a structural difference in the fimbrial regulatory gene fimK may contribute to differential co-regulation of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae between the two Klebsiella species.",

    "abstract": "Glucose homeostasis is maintained by insulin. It has been observed that hyperinsulinemia precedes insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is caused by multiple factors including genetic and diet. The molecular mechanism underlying insulin resistance (IR) is not completely understood. Using Glut4 and insulin receptor-expressing CHO cells we had previously shown that prolonged exposure of these cells to insulin in the absence of high levels of glucose led to insulin resistance in the cells. In the present study, we have shown that the underlying cause for the impaired GLUT4 trafficking is the defective PI3K/AKT pathway. This insulin resistance is likely due to epigenetic alterations as it is stable and can be maintained for several generations even when insulin is not provided, and epigenetic modifiers can reverse the insulin resistance. We extended these studies to liver cell line (BRL-3A) and show that these cells also develop impaired insulin signaling upon exposure to insulin in the absence of high levels of glucose. Transcriptomic analysis of the insulin-sensitive and -resistance cells uncover altered signaling networks involved in chromatin remodelling, Rho GTPases, and ubiquitination. Pathway analysis reveals the role of demethylase Kdm5b and lysine methyltransferase (Kmt2a and Kmt2e) in the development of insulin resistance. It is also observed that trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is increased in insulin resistance cellular models. We further showed that mice injected with low doses of insulin when fasting develop insulin resistance with impaired glucose tolerance and increased HOMA-IR index. Altogether, these findings suggest dysregulated synthesis of insulin in the absence of glucose stimulus could lead to epigenetic alterations that may lead to insulin resistance.\n\nSummary StatementInsulin stimulation in the absence of glucose leads to insulin resistance. We have developed a cell and mouse model of insulin resistance in this study to characterise the molecular signalling involved in insulin resistance and early onset of type 2 diabetes. The transcriptomic analysis provides new insights on epi-transcriptomic regulation in insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Phazolicin (PHZ) is a peptide antibiotic exhibiting narrow-spectrum activity against rhizobia closely related to its producer Rhizobium sp. Pop5. Using genetic and biochemical techniques, we here identified BacA and YejABEF as two importers of PHZ in a sensitive model strain Sinorhizobium meliloti Sm1021. BacA and YejABEF are members of SLiPT and ABC transporter families of non-specific peptide importers, respectively. The uptake of PHZ by two distinct families of transporters dramatically decreases the naturally occurring rate of resistance. Moreover, since both BacA and YejABEF are essential for the development of functional symbiosis of rhizobia with leguminous plants, the acquisition of PHZ resistance via the inactivation of transporters is further disfavoured since single bacA or yejABEF mutants are unable to propagate in root nodules. Crystal structures of the periplasmic subunit YejA from S. meliloti and Escherichia coli revealed fortuitous bound peptides, suggesting a non-specific peptide-binding mechanism that facilitates the uptake of PHZ and other antimicrobial peptides.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMany bacteria produce antimicrobial peptides to eliminate competitors and create an exclusive niche. These peptides kill bacteria by either membrane disruption or inhibiting essential intracellular processes. The Achilles heel of the latter type of antimicrobials is their dependence on transporters to enter the susceptible bacteria since mutations in such transporters result in resistance. We describe here how the ribosome-targeting peptide phazolicin, produced by Rhizobium sp. Pop5, uses two different transporters, BacA and YejABEF, to get into the cells of the symbiotic bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. This dramatically reduces the probability of resistance acquisition. Both transporters need to be inactivated for phazolicin resistance acquisition. Since these transporters are also crucial in S. meliloti for its symbiotic association with host plants, their inactivation in biological settings is highly unlikely. This makes PHZ an attractive lead for the development of a biocontrol agent with potential for use in agriculture.",

Here we identify the 2,3 cyclic phosphatase Angel1 as a rate-limiting factor for this process in human cells. Angel1 associates with proteins of the RQC pathway and with mRNA coding regions, consistent with a factor that monitors the translation process. Depletion of Angel1 causes stabilization of reporter mRNAs that are targeted for RQC by the absence of stop codons, but not an mRNA targeted for nonsense-mediated decay. Angel1 catalytic activity is critical for its function in RQC, as a catalytic inactivating mutation causes loss of RQC function. We also identify N4BP2 as the human RQC endonuclease. Given the biochemical activity of Angel1 as a 2,3 cyclic phosphatase, our findings suggest that a rate-limiting step in RQC-mediated mRNA decay is the resolution of a cyclic phosphate, possibly one generated upon N4BP2 cleavage.",

    "abstract": "Human limbs emerge during the fourth post-conception week as mesenchymal buds which develop into fully-formed limbs over the subsequent months. Limb development is orchestrated by numerous temporally and spatially restricted gene expression programmes, making congenital alterations in phenotype common. Decades of work with model organisms has outlined the fundamental processes underlying vertebrate limb development, but an in-depth characterisation of this process in humans has yet to be performed. Here we detail the development of the human embryonic limb across space and time, using both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We demonstrate extensive diversification of cells, progressing from a restricted number of multipotent progenitors to myriad mature cell states, and identify several novel cell populations, including neural fibroblasts and multiple distinct mesenchymal states. We uncover two waves of human muscle development, each characterised by different cell states regulated by separate gene expression programmes. We identify musculin (MSC) as a key transcriptional repressor maintaining muscle stem cell identity and validate this by performing MSC knock down in human embryonic myoblasts, which results in significant upregulation of late myogenic genes. Through integration of multiple anatomically continuous spatial transcriptomic samples, we spatially map single-cell clusters across a sagittal section of a whole fetal hindlimb. We reveal a clear anatomical segregation between genes linked to brachydactyly and polysyndactyly, and uncover transcriptionally and spatially distinct populations of mesenchyme in the autopod. Finally, we perform scRNA-seq on murine embryonic limbs to facilitate cross-species developmental comparison at single-cell resolution, finding substantial homology between the two species.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is prevalent in nature and can facilitate the acclimation of organisms to changing environments. Recombination rate is plastic in a diversity of organisms and under a variety of stressful conditions. However, the recent finding that Wolbachia pipientis induces plastic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster was surprising because Wolbachia is not strictly considered a stressor to this host. We investigate the molecular mechanisms of Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination by comparing the ovarian transcriptomes of D. melanogaster infected and uninfected with Wolbachia. Our data suggest that infection explains a small amount of transcriptional variation but specifically affects genes related to cell cycle, translation, and metabolism. We also find enrichment of cell division and recombination processes among genes with infection-associated differential expression. Broadly, the transcriptomic changes identified in this study provide insight for the mechanisms of microbe-mediated plastic recombination, an important but poorly understood facet of host-microbe dynamics.\n\nSignificance StatementThough it is documented that Wolbachia is associated with increased recombination in D. melanogaster, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we use ovarian transcriptomics in Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies to identify candidate genes underlying Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination. We find that infection alters ovarian gene expression in subtle ways, and also identify exciting candidate genes for functional analysis in subsequent work. These candidate genes may be the first step in determining the molecular mechanisms underlying Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination. Moreover, our data contribute to the growing body of knowledge surrounding how Wolbachia affects host gene expression, and highlights how context-dependent these effects are.",

External validation of the model derived from a separate trial, exhibited even better results (R2 = 0.99; RMSE = 0.45).

    "abstract": "Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) are key mediators of the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway that regulates biological functions as diverse as smooth muscle contraction, cardiac function, and axon guidance. Campaigns targeting nitric oxide synthases and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in this signaling axis suggest that understanding how cGMP differentially triggers mammalian PKG isoforms could lead to new therapeutics that inhibit or activate PKGs. Alternate splicing of PRKG1 transcripts confers distinct leucine zippers, linkers, and auto-inhibitory pseudo-substrate sequences to PKG I and I{beta} that result in isoform-specific activation properties, but the mechanism of enzyme auto-inhibition and its alleviation by cGMP is still not well understood. Here we present a crystal structure of PKG I{beta} in which the auto-inhibitory sequence and the cyclic nucleotide binding domains are bound to the catalytic domain, providing a snapshot of the auto-inhibited state. Specific contacts between the PKG I{beta} auto-inhibitory sequence and the enzyme active site help explain isoform-specific activation constants and the effects of phosphorylation in the linker. We also present a crystal structure of a PKG I cyclic nucleotide binding domain with an activating mutation linked to Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections. Similarity of this structure to wild type cGMP-bound domains and differences with the auto-inhibited enzyme provide a mechanistic basis for constitutive activation. We show that PKG I{beta} auto-inhibition is mediated by contacts within each monomer of the native full-length dimeric protein, and using the available structural and biochemical data we develop a model for the regulation and activation of PKGs.",

    "abstract": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a natural genetic engineer that transfers DNA into plants and this is the most frequently applied process for the generation of genetically modified plants. DNA transfer is mediated by a type IV secretion system localized in the cell envelope and extracellular T-pili. We here report the cryo-electron microscopic structures of the T-pilus at 3.2[A] resolution and that of the related plasmid pKM101-determined N-pilus at 3[A] resolution. Both pili contain a main pilus protein (VirB2 in A. tumefaciens and TraM in pKM101) and phospholipids arranged in a 5-start helical assembly. They contain positively charged amino acids in the pilus lumen and the lipids are positively charged in the T-pilus (phosphatidylcholine) conferring overall positive charge to the lumen. Mutagenesis of the lumen-exposed Arg91 residue in VirB2 resulted in protein destabilization and loss of pilus formation. Our results reveal that different phospholipids can be incorporated into type IV secretion system pili and that the charge of the lumen is of functional importance.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is an important intermediate for the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, histidine, tryptophan, and cofactors NAD and NADP. Abnormal regulation of PRPP synthase (PRPS) has been associated with human disorders including Arts syndrome, retinal dystrophy and gouty arthritis. Recent studies have revealed that PRPS can form filamentous cytoophidia in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we resolve two distinct filament structures of E. coli PRPS at near-atomic resolution under Cryo-EM. Formation of two types of filaments is controlled by the binding of different ligands. While the type A filament attenuates the allosteric inhibition of PRPS by ADP, the type B filament enhances the inhibition. In addition, a novel conformation of the regulatory flexible loop of PRPS was found occupying the ATP binding site. AMP/ADP bound at a noncanonical allosteric site interacts with the regulatory flexible loop and facilitates the binding of ATP. Our findings not only reveal molecular mechanisms of the regulation of PRPS with structural basis, but also suggest a distinctive bidirectional regulatory system for PRPP production via PRPS polymerization.",

    "abstract": "Across bacteria, protein-based organelles called bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) encapsulate key enzymes to regulate their activities. The model BMC is the carboxysome that encapsulates enzymes for CO2 fixation to increase efficiency and is found in many autotrophic bacteria, such as cyanobacteria. Despite their importance in the global carbon cycle, little is known about how carboxysomes are spatially regulated. We recently identified the two-factor system required for the maintenance of carboxysome distribution (McdAB). McdA drives the equal spacing of carboxysomes via interactions with McdB, which associates with carboxysomes. McdA is a ParA/MinD ATPase, a protein family well-studied in positioning diverse cellular structures in bacteria. However, the adaptor proteins like McdB that connect these ATPases to their cargos are extremely diverse. In fact, McdB represents a completely unstudied class of proteins. Despite the diversity, many adaptor proteins undergo phase separation, but functional roles remain unclear. Here, we define the domain architecture of McdB from the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and dissect its mode of biomolecular condensate formation. We identify an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that modulates condensate solubility, a central coiled-coil dimerizing domain that drives condensate formation, and a C-terminal domain that trimerizes McdB dimers and provides increased valency for condensate formation. We then identify critical basic residues in the IDR, which we mutate to fine-tune condensate solubility. Finally, we find that a condensate-defective mutant of McdB has altered association with carboxysomes and influences carboxysome enzyme content. The results have broad implications for understanding spatial organization of BMCs and the molecular grammar of protein condensates.",

To reduce microbial bioburden and surface-based transmission of infectious disease, the use of antibacterial and self-sanitizing surfaces, such as copper (Cu), is being explored in clinical settings. Cu has long been known to have antimicrobial activity. However, Gram-positive microorganisms, a class that includes pathogens commonly responsible for hospital-acquired infection such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridioides difficile, are more resilient to its biocidal effect. Inspired by inherently bactericidal nanostructured surfaces found in nature, we have developed an improved Cu coating, engineered to contain nanoscale surface features and thus increase its antibacterial activity against a broader range of organisms. In addition, we have established a new method for facilitating the rapid and continuous release of biocidal metal ions from the coating, through incorporation of an antibacterial metal salt (ZnCl2) with a lower reduction potential than Cu. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was used to fabricate our coatings, which serves as a low-cost and scalable route for modifying existing conductive surfaces with complex shape. By tuning both the surface morphology and chemistry, we were able to create a nanocomposite Cu coating that decreased the microbial bioburden of Gram-positive S.aureus by 94% compared to unmodified Cu.\n\nTable of Contents O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY Antimicrobial copper (Cu) products are being deployed in clinical settings to decrease microbial bioburden and prevent surface-based transmission of infectious disease.

Here, we present a methodology for quantitatively analyzing such Min patterns, aiming for reproducibility, user-independence, and easy usage. After introducing pattern-feature definitions and image-processing concepts, we present an analysis pipeline where we use autocorrelation analysis to extract global parameters such as the average spatial wavelength and oscillation period.

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that {Delta}40p53, the translational isoform of p53, can inhibit cell growth independently of p53 by regulating microRNAs. Here, we explored the role of {Delta}40p53 in regulating the long non-coding RNA-microRNA-cellular process axis, specifically focusing on LINC00176. Interestingly, LINC00176 levels were predominantly affected by the overexpression/stress-mediated induction and knockdown of {Delta}40p53 rather than p53 levels. Additional assays revealed that {Delta}40p53 transactivates LINC00176 transcriptionally and could also regulate its stability. RNA immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LINC00176 sequesters several putative microRNA targets, which could further titrate several mRNA targets involved in different cellular processes. To understand the downstream effects of this regulation, we ectopically overexpressed and knocked down LINC00176 in HCT116 p53-/- (harboring only {Delta}40p53) cells, which affected their proliferation, cell viability, and expression of epithelial markers. Our results provide essential insights into the pivotal role of {Delta}40p53 in regulating the novel LINC00176 RNA-microRNA-mRNA axis independent of FL-p53 and in maintaining cellular homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a highly aggressive disease associated with sickle hemoglobinopathies and universal loss of the tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1. RMC has a relatively low rate of incidence compared with other renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) that has hitherto made molecular profiling difficult. To probe this rare disease in detail we performed an in-depth characterization of the RMC tumor microenvironment using a combination of genomic, metabolic and single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments on tissue from a representative untreated RMC patient, complemented by retrospective analyses of archival tissue and existing published data. Our study of the tumor identifies a heterogenous population of malignant cell states originating from the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle within the renal medulla, displaying the hallmarks of increased resistance to cell death by ferroptosis and proteotoxic stress driven by MYC-induced proliferative signals. Specifically, genomic characterization of RMC tumors provides substantiating evidence for the recently proposed dependence of SMARCB1-difficient cancers on an intact CDKN2A-p53 pathway and we suggest increased cystine-mTORC-GPX4 signaling also plays a role within transformed RMC cells. We further propose that RMC has an immune landscape comparable to that of untreated RCCs, including heterogenous expression of the immune ligand CD70 within a sub-population of tumor cells, which could provide an immune-modulatory role that serves as a viable candidate for therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "The role of aberrant glycosylation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains an under-investigated area of research. In this study, we determined that the ST6GAL1 sialyltransferase, which adds 2,6-linked sialic acids to N-glycosylated proteins, is upregulated in patients with early-stage PDAC, and further increased in advanced disease. A tumor-promoting function for ST6GAL1 was elucidated using tumor xenograft models with human PDAC cells. Additionally, we developed a genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) with transgenic expression of ST6GAL1 in the pancreas, and found that mice with dual expression of ST6GAL1 and oncogenic KRASG12D have greatly accelerated PDAC progression and mortality compared with mice expressing KRASG12D alone. As ST6GAL1 imparts progenitor-like characteristics, we interrogated ST6GAL1s role in acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM), a process that fosters neoplasia by reprogramming acinar cells into ductal, progenitor-like cells. We confirmed that ST6GAL1 promotes ADM using multiple models including the 266-6 cell line, GEM-derived organoids and tissues, and an in vivo model of inflammation-induced ADM. EGFR is a key driver of ADM and is known to be activated by ST6GAL1-mediated sialylation. Importantly, EGFR activation was dramatically increased in acinar cells and organoids from mice with transgenic ST6GAL1 expression. These collective results highlight a novel glycosylation-dependent mechanism involved in early stages of pancreatic neoplasia.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome analysis via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a standard technique employed across various biological fields of study. This rapid adoption of the RNA-seq approach has been mediated, in part, by the development of different commercial RNA-seq library preparation kits compatible with standard next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms. Generally, the essential steps of library preparation such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion and first-strand cDNA synthesis are tailored to a specific group of organisms (e.g. eukaryotes vs. prokaryotes) or genomic GC content. Therefore, the selection of appropriate commercial products is of crucial importance to capture the transcriptome of interest as closely to the native state as possible without introduction of technical bias. However, researchers rarely have the resources and time to test various commercial RNA-seq kits for their samples. This work reports a side-by-side comparison of RNA-seq data from Clostridium autoethanogenum obtained using three commercial rRNA removal and strand-specific library construction products by NuGEN Technologies, Qiagen, and Zymo Research and assesses their performance relative to published data. While all three vendors advertise their products as suitable for prokaryotes, we found significant differences in their performance regarding rRNA removal, strand-specificity, and, most importantly, transcript abundance distribution profiles. Notably, RNA-seq data obtained with Qiagen products were most similar to published data and delivered the best results in terms of library strandedness and transcript abundance distribution range. Our results highlight the importance of finding appropriate organism-specific workflows and library preparation products for RNA-seq studies.\n\nImportanceRNA-seq is a powerful technique for transcriptome profiling while involving elaborate sample processing before library sequencing. Our work is important as we show that RNA-seq library preparation kits can strongly affect the outcome of the RNA-seq experiment. Although library preparation benefits from the availability of various commercial kits, choosing appropriate products for the specific samples can be challenging for new users or for users working with unconventional organisms. Evaluating the performance of different commercial products requires significant financial and time investment infeasible to most researchers. Therefore, users are often guided in their choice of kits by published data involving similar input samples. We conclude that important consideration should be given to selecting of sample processing workflows for any given organism.",

Recent studies have revealed that inhibitory neurons in the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus and excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons are two key subcortical players in generating SWD. However, the signals that drive SWD-related thalamic activity remain elusive. Here, we show that SWD predominately occurs during wakefulness in several mouse models of absence epilepsy. In more focused studies of Gnb1 mutant mice, we found that sensory input regulates SWD. Using in vivo recording, we demonstrate that TC cells are activated prior to the onset of SWD and then inhibited during SWD. On the contrary, RT cells are slightly inhibited prior to SWD, but are strongly activated during SWD. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of TC cells leads to the enhancement of SWD in Gnb1 mice. Together, our results indicate that sensory input in the periphery can regulate SWD by activating the thalamocortical pathway.",

    "abstract": "Human anelloviruses are acquired universally in infancy, highly prevalent, abundant in blood, and extremely diverse. Their apparent lack of pathogenicity indicates that they are a major component of the commensal human virome. Despite their being extensively intertwined with human biology, these viruses are poorly understood. A major impediment in studying anelloviruses is the lack of an in vitro system for their production and/ or propagation. Here we show that the T cell-derived human cell line MOLT-4 can be transfected with plasmids comprising tandem anellovirus genomes to produce viral particles visualized by electron microscopy. We found that a previously described human anellovirus of the Betatorquevirus genus (LY2), as well as a second Betatorquevirus detected by sequencing DNA extracted from a human retinal pigmental epithelium (nrVL4619), can be synthesized and produced by these means, enabling further molecular virology studies. Southern blot was used to demonstrate replication, and site-directed mutagenesis of the viral genome was performed to show that the production of anellovirus in this cell line is dependent on the expression of certain viral proteins. Finally, experiments performed in mice using purified nrVL4619 particles produced in MOLT-4 cells demonstrated infectivity in vivo in the tissue of origin. These results indicate that anelloviruses can be produced in vitro and manipulated to improve our understanding of this viral family which is ubiquitous in humans and many other mammals. Applications of this work to gene therapy and other therapeutic modalities are currently under investigation.\n\nIMPORTANCEAnelloviruses are a major component of the human virome. However, their biology is not well understood mainly due to the lack of an in vitro system for anellovirus production and/or propagation.

Additionally, we show that anellovirus particles generated in this in vitro system demonstrate infectivity in vivo.

    "abstract": "Forty-three myxobacterial strains were isolated and identified from 20 soil samples collected in Vietnam. The information on morphological characteristics and 16S ribosomal gene sequencing showed that these strains were designated to seven genera belonging to Angiococcus, Archangium, Chondromyces, Corallococcus, Cystobacter, Melittangium, and Myxococcus, in suborder Cystobacterineae and Sorangiineae. The phylogenetic tree was constructed to clarify the genetic relationship between myxobacterial isolates. Myxobacteria were cultured, and crude extracts were obtained after 10-day fermentation in P-medium in the presence of the Amberlite XAD 16N adsorbent resin. Elution was carried out with acetone and methanol to obtain the crude extracts. Evaluation of antioxidant activity used the DPPH and ABTS assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration values were determined by the microdilution method. The total extract from CT21 had the highest total antioxidant activity (IC50 = 52.34 {+/-} 1.47 {micro}g/mL, 30.28 {+/-} 0.74 {micro}g/mL for DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively).

The highest active strains were members of Myxococcus sp. genus.",

    "abstract": "Biogenesis of different classes of eukaryotic RNAs proceeds via different pathways that require strict spatiotemporal resolution. The intracellular organization has evolved to provide order for RNA processing to coordinate different maturation steps with specific enzymatic reaction. In higher eukaryotes, processing of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) is postulated to be almost entirely intranuclear, while in lower eukaryotes like yeast, tRNA maturation is both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Here, we show that tRNA processing is largely cytosolic event in human cells. After transcription, unprocessed precursors of tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) bound by La protein are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Using cell fractionation analysis and pre-tRNA-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol, we show tRNA splicing/ligation and end-processing takes place in the cytoplasm where majority of processing enzymes is also located. We propose here a model where processing of intron-less and intron-containing pre-tRNAs is cytoplasmic similarly to the observed in lower eukaryotes, although tRNA splicing precedes 5- and 3-end processing in human cells unlike in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination plays a critical evolutionary role in maintaining fitness in response to selective pressures due to changing environments. Variation in recombination rate has been observed amongst and between species and populations and within genomes across numerous taxa. Studies have demonstrated a link between changes in recombination rate and selection but the extent to which fine scale recombination rate varies between evolved populations during the evolutionary period in response to selection is under active research. Here we utilize a set of three temperature-evolved Drosophila melanogaster populations that were shown to have diverged in several phenotypes including recombination rate based on the temperature regime in which they evolved. Using whole genome sequencing data of these populations, we generated fine scale recombination maps of the three populations. We compare recombination rates and patterns among the three populations and show that they have diverged at fine scales but are conserved at broader scales. We further demonstrate a correlation between recombination rates and genomic variation in the three populations and observe variation in putative warm-spots between the populations with these enhanced areas and associated genes overlapping areas previously shown to have diverged in the three populations due to selection. These data support the existence of recombination modifiers in these populations which are subject to selection during evolutionary change.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a systemic vascular disease of the legs that results in a blockage of blood flow from the heart to the lower extremities. Now one of the most common causes of mortality in the U.S., the first line of therapy for PAD is to mechanically open the blockages using balloon angioplasty. Coating the balloons with antiproliferative agents can potentially reduce vessel re-narrowing, or restenosis after surgical intervention, but current drug-coated balloons releasing chemotherapy agents like paclitaxel have in some cases shown increased mortality long-term. Our aim was to design a novel drug-coated balloon using a polymeric nanodelivery system for a sustained release of polyphenols that reduce restenosis but with reduced toxicity compared to chemotherapy agents. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with entrapped quercetin, a dimethoxy quercetin (rhamnazin), as well as quercetin conjugated to PLGA, were developed. Balloon catheters were coated with polymeric nanoparticles using an ultrasonic method, and nanoparticle characteristics, drug loading, coating uniformity and drug release were determined. The adhesion of nanoparticles to vascular smooth muscle cells and the antiproliferative effect of nano-delivered polyphenols were also assessed. Of the nanoparticle systems tested, those with covalently attached quercetin provided the most sustained release over a 6-day period. Although these particles adhered to cells to a smaller extent compared to other nanoparticle formulations, their attachment was resistant to washing. These particles also exhibited the greatest anti-proliferative effect. In addition, their attachment was not altered when the cells were grown in calcifying conditions, and in PAD tissue calcification is typically a condition that impedes drug delivery. Moreover, the ultrasonic coating method generated a uniform balloon coating. The polymeric nanoparticle system with covalently attached quercetin developed herein is thus proposed as a promising platform to reduce restenosis post-angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "A key question in biology is why genomic variation persists in a population for extended periods. Recent studies have identified examples of genomic deletions that have remained polymorphic in the human lineage for hundreds of millennia, ostensibly owing to balancing selection. Nevertheless, genome-wide investigations of ancient and possibly adaptive deletions remain an imperative exercise. Here, we used simulations to show an excess of ancient allele sharing between modern and archaic human genomes that cannot be explained solely by introgression or ancient structure under neutrality. We identified 63 deletion polymorphisms that emerged before the divergence of humans and Neanderthals and are associated with GWAS traits. We used empirical and simulation-based analyses to show that the haplotypes that harbor these functional ancient deletions have likely been evolving under time- and geography-dependent balancing selection. Collectively, our results suggest that balancing selection may have maintained at least 27% of the functional deletion polymorphisms in humans for hundreds of thousands of years.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control improves into young adulthood after specialization of relevant brain systems during adolescence. However, the biological mechanisms supporting this unique transition are not well understood. Given that adolescence is defined by pubertal maturation, we examined relative contributions of chronological age and pubertal maturation to inhibitory control development. 105 8-19-year-olds completed 1-5 longitudinal visits (227 visits total) in which pubertal development was assessed via self-reported Tanner stage and inhibitory control was assessed with an in-scanner antisaccade task. As expected, percent and latency of correct antisaccade responses improved with age and pubertal stage. When controlling for pubertal stage, chronological age was distinctly associated with correct response rate. In contrast, pubertal stage was uniquely associated with antisaccade latency even when controlling for age. Chronological age was associated with fMRI task activation in several regions including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while puberty was associated with right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activation. Furthermore, task-related connectivity between VLPFC and cingulate was associated with both pubertal stage and response latency. These results suggest that while age-related developmental processes may support maturation of brain systems underlying the ability to inhibit a response, puberty may play a larger role in the effectiveness of generating cognitive control responses.",

Two concentrations of insect chitosan were considered in order to assess the role of the insect chitosan concentration during the heat process as an antimicrobial replacement for crustacean chitosan.\n\nResults of the study indicated that the DT values were clearly higher in the substrate without chitosan than in the substrate containing chitosan thus indicating a greater heat resistance to heat treatment of the microorganism inoculated in the substrate without chitosan. This behaviour was also evidenced in the survival curves. There were no great differences between either of the insect chitosan concentrations tested regarding the DT values. The z values were 9.8 {o}C on rice substrate. 8.9 {o}C on rice substrate supplemented with insect chitosan at 150 {micro}g/mL and 10.7 {o}C on rice substrate supplemented with 250 {micro}g/mL of insect chitosan, the chitosan concentration appears to affect the z value of the microorganism. Our results indicate that the combination of heat with insect chitosan as an antimicrobial on foodstuffs subjected to cooking is feasible and can improve the safety of rice derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Brain development requires the intricate balance between division, death, and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we report the discovery of Snip1 as a key regulator of these NPC phases. The conditional deletion of Snip1 in the mouse embryonic brain causes dysplasia with robust induction of caspase 9-dependent apoptosis. In NPCs, Snip1 suppresses the genetic programs of apoptosis and developmental signaling pathways and promotes the genetic programs of cell cycle, neurogenesis, and cortical development. Mechanistically, Snip1 binds to the Polycomb complex PRC2, co-occupies gene targets with PRC2, and regulates H3K27 marks. Deletion of PRC2 is sufficient to reduce apoptosis and brain dysplasia and partially restore genetic programs and tissue development in the Snip1-depleted brain. Our findings suggest that Snip1 exerts loci-dependent regulation of PRC2 and H3K27me3 to toggle between cell fates in the developing brain.",

    "abstract": "Escalating climatic and anthropogenic pressures expose ecosystems worldwide to increasingly frequent disturbances. Yet, our ability to forecast the responses of natural populations to these disturbances is impeded by a limited understanding for how exposure to stochastic environments shapes population resilience. Instead, the resilience, and vulnerability, of natural populations to ongoing global change is often presumed based on their contemporary exposure to environmental stochasticity. To test the validity of this assumption, we investigated the association between the resilience attributes (e.g., resistance and recovery) of natural animal and plant populations, and measures of local environmental stochasticity (e.g., spectral frequency and abiotic range); collating data from 2,242 populations across 369 animal, plant, and algal species. Unexpectedly, recent abiotic stochasticity regimes from the past 50 years do not predict the inherent ability of populations to resist or recover from disturbances. Instead, population resilience is strongly affected by phylogenetic relationships among species, with survival and developmental investments shaping their responses to stochastic regimes. Contrary to the classical assumption that exposure to recent environmental shifts confers a greater ability to cope with current and future global change, our findings suggest that population resilience is a consequence of evolutionary processes and/or deep-time environmental regimes.\n\nSignificance statementPopulations that currently endure more variable abiotic conditions are often expected to be less vulnerable to future increases in climatic variability. However, without defining the link between abiotic variability and the capacity for populations to resist and recover following disturbances (i.e., their resilience), we cannot predict the consequences of ongoing community reassembly. Evaluating the association between measures of abiotic variability and the resilience attributes of 2,242 animal, plant, and algae populations, we discredit the assumption that contemporary exposure to more frequent environmental shifts confers a greater ability to cope with future global change. Instead, the resilience attributes of natural populations appear to have been moulded over longer-term evolutionary timeframes and are thus not a response to more recent experiences.",

While habits have been hypothesized to be a key aspect of motor skill acquisition, there has been little empirical work investigating the relationship between skills and habits. To better understand this relationship, we examined whether and when peoples behavior would become habitual as they learned a challenging new motor skill. After up to ten days of practice, we altered the structure of the task to assess whether participants would flexibly adjust their behavior or habitually persist in performing the task the way they originally learned. We found that participants behavior became habitual early in practice--after only two days--at which point they were still relatively unskilled. These data demonstrate that motor skills become habitual after relatively little training, but can nevertheless further improve with practice.",
