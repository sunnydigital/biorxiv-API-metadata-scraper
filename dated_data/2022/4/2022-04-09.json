    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is difficult to diagnose in early stages. Without homeostatic control, urine was reported to have the ability to accumulate early changes in the body. We expect that urinary proteome can reflect early changes in the nervous system. In this study, the early urinary proteome changes in a most employed multiple sclerosis rat model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)) were analyzed to explore early urinary candidate biomarkers, and early treatment of methylprednisolone were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect. Compare with controls, twenty-five urinary proteins were altered at day 7 when there were no clinical symptoms and no obvious histological changes. Among them, twenty-three have human homologs and fourteen were reported to be differently expressed in the serum/cerebrospinal fluid/brain tissues of multiple sclerosis patients or animal models. Functional analysis showed that the dysregulated proteins were associated with asparagine degradation, neuroinflammation and lipid metabolism. After the early treatment of methylprednisolone, the incidence of encephalomyelitis in the intervention group was only 1/13. This study demonstrates that urine may be a good source of biomarkers for the early detection of multiple sclerosis and early treatment can significantly delay disease progression. These findings may provide important information for early diagnosis and intervention of multiple sclerosis in the future.",

    "abstract": "Glucose transporter GLUT1 is ubiquitously expressed in the human body from the red cells to the blood-brain barrier to the skeletal muscles. It is physiologically relevant to understand how GLUT1 facilitates diffusion of glucose across the cell membrane. It is also pathologically relevant because GLUT1 deficiency causes neurological disorders and anemia and because GLUT1 overexpression fuels the abnormal growth of cancer cells. This article presents a quantitative investigation of GLUT1 based on all-atom molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of the transporter embedded in lipid bilayers of asymmetric inner-and-outer-leaflet lipid compositions, subject to asymmetric intra-and-extra-cellular environments. This is in contrast with the current literature of MD studies that have not considered both of the aforementioned asymmetries of the cell membrane. The equilibrium (unbiased) dynamics of GLUT1 shows that it can facilitate glucose diffusion across the cell membrane without undergoing large-scale conformational motions. The Gibbs free-energy profile, which is still lacking in the current literature of GLUT1, quantitatively characterizes the diffusion path of glucose from the periplasm, through an extracellular gate of GLUT1, on to the binding site, and off to the cytoplasm. This transport mechanism is validated by the experimental data that GLUT1 has low water-permeability, uptake-efflux symmetry, and 10 kcal/mol Arrhenius activation barrier around 37{degrees}C.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT (or TABLE OF CONTENTS ENTRY)\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/787259v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@287ab0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ecd68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4fa531org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e63b4e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Speech perception requires the binding of spatiotemporally disjoint auditory-visual cues. The corresponding brain network-level information can be characterized by two complementary mechanisms, functional segregation which refers to the localization of processing, and integration which pertains to cooperation among relevant functional modules. Here, we demonstrate using fMRI recordings that subjective perceptual experience of multisensory speech stimuli, real and illusory, are represented in differential states of segregation-integration balance. We controlled the inter-subject variability of illusory/cross-modal perception parametrically, by introducing temporal lags in the incongruent auditory-visual articulations of speech sounds using the McGurk paradigm. The functional segregation-integration balance was captured using two alternative computational approaches. First, the module responsible for cross-modal binding of sesnory signals defined as the perceptual binding network (PBN) was identified using standardized parametric statistical approaches and their temporal correlations with all other brain areas were computed. With increasing illusory perception, the majority of the nodes of PBN showed decreased cooperation with the rest of the brain, reflecting high local segregation but reduced global integration. Second, using graph theoretic measures, the altered patterns of local segregation-global integration were cross-validated.",

The choice of such references --i.e., templates-- and atlases is one relevant source of methodological variability across studies, which has recently been brought to attention as an important challenge to reproducibility in neuroscience. TemplateFlow is a publicly available framework for human and nonhuman brain models. The framework combines an open database with software for access, management, and vetting, allowing scientists to distribute their resources under FAIR --findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable-- principles.

    "abstract": "High-throughput experimental methods in neuroscience have led to an explosion of techniques for measuring complex interactions and multi-dimensional patterns. However, whether sophisticated measures of emergent phenomena can be traced back to simpler low-dimensional statistics is largely unknown. To explore this question, we examine resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data using complex topology measures from network neuroscience. We show that spatial and temporal autocorrelation are reliable statistics which explain numerous measures of network topology. Surrogate timeseries with subject-matched spatial and temporal autocorrelation capture nearly all reliable individual and regional variation in these topology measures. Network topology changes during aging are driven by spatial autocorrelation, and multiple serotonergic drugs causally induce the same topographic change in temporal autocorrelation. This reductionistic interpretation of widely-used complexity measures may help link them to neurobiology.",

Here, we test the null hypothesis that bams differentiation function is conserved between D. melanogaster and four additional Drosophila species in the melanogaster species group spanning approximately 30 million years of divergence. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that bam is not necessary for oogenesis or spermatogenesis in D. teissieri nor is bam necessary for spermatogenesis in D. ananassae. Remarkably bam function may change on a relatively short time scale. We further report tests of neutral sequence evolution at bam in additional species of Drosophila and find a positive, but not perfect, correlation between evidence for positive selection at bam and its essential role in GSC regulation and fertility for both males and females. Further characterization of bam function in more divergent lineages will be necessary to distinguish between bams critical gametogenesis role being newly derived in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, and D. ananassae females or it being basal to the genus and subsequently lost in numerous lineages.",

Despite this significant role, dynamic thalamic gating and the consequences for downstream cortical sensory representations have not been well studied in the awake brain. We optogenetically modulated the ventro-posterior medial thalamus in the vibrissa pathway of the awake mouse, and measured spiking activity in the thalamus, and activity in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) using extracellular electrophysiology and genetically encoded voltage imaging. Thalamic hyperpolarization significantly enhanced thalamic sensory-evoked bursting, yet surprisingly the S1 cortical response was not amplified, but instead timing precision was significantly increased, spatial activation more focused, and there was an increased synchronization of cortical inhibitory neurons. A thalamocortical network model implicates the modulation of precise timing of feedforward thalamic population spiking, presenting a highly sensitive, timing-based gating of sensory signaling to cortex.",

    "abstract": "Embodied theories of semantic cognition predict that brain regions involved in motion perception are engaged when people comprehend motion concepts expressed in language. Left lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) is implicated in both motion perception and motion concept processing but prior studies have produced mixed findings on which parts of this region are engaged by motion language. We scanned participants performing semantic judgements about sentences describing motion events and static events. We performed univariate analyses, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses to investigate the effect of motion on activity and connectivity in different parts of LOTC. In multivariate analyses that decoded whether a sentence described motion or not, the middle and posterior parts of LOTC showed above-chance level performance, with performance exceeding that of other brain regions. Univariate ROI analyses found the middle part of LOTC was more active for motion events than static ones. Finally, PPI analyses found that when processing motion events, the middle and posterior parts of LOTC (overlapping with motion perception regions), increased their connectivity with cognitive control regions. Taken together, these results indicate that the more posterior parts of LOTC, including motion perception cortex, respond differently to motion vs. static events. These findings are consistent with embodiment accounts of semantic processing, and suggest that understanding verbal descriptions of motion engages areas of the occipitotemporal cortex involved in perceiving motion.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a large, enveloped DNA virus and its assembly in the cell is a complex multi-step process during which viral particles interact with numerous cellular compartments such as the nucleus and organelles of the secretory pathway. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy are commonly used to study HSV-1 infection. However, 2D imaging limits our understanding of the 3D geometric changes to cellular compartments that accompany infection and sample processing can introduce morphological artefacts that complicate interpretation. In this study, we used soft X-ray tomography to observe differences in whole-cell architecture between HSV-1 infected and uninfected cells. To protect the near-native structure of cellular compartments we used a non-disruptive sample preparation technique involving rapid cryopreservation, and a fluorescent reporter virus was used to facilitate correlation of structural changes with the stage of infection in individual cells. We observed viral capsids and assembly intermediates interacting with nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. Additionally, we observed differences in the morphology of specific organelles between uninfected and infected cells. The local concentration of cytoplasmic vesicles at the juxtanuclear compartment increased and their mean width decreased as infection proceeded, and lipid droplets transiently increased in size. Furthermore, mitochondria in infected cells were elongated and highly branched, suggesting that HSV-1 infection alters the dynamics of mitochondrial fission/fusion. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution 3D images of cellular compartments can be captured in a near-native state using soft X-ray tomography and have revealed that infection causes striking changes to the morphology of intracellular organelles.\n\nImportanceUltrastructural changes to the morphology and organization of cellular compartments during herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection have not previously been studied under near-physiological conditions. In this study, soft X-ray tomography was used to image the ultrastructure of vitrified cells during HSV-1 infection, identifying striking changes to the abundance and organization of cytoplasmic vesicles and mitochondria. The concentration of vesicles in the juxtanuclear region increased with time post infection, which could represent an increasing supply of vesicles to support capsid envelopment, and there is a transient increase in the size of lipid droplets in infected cells. Furthermore, we show that mitochondria elongate and form highly-branched networks as infection progresses. These findings offer insight into stages of virion morphogenesis and the cellular response to infection, highlighting the utility of cryo-soft-X-ray tomography for monitoring the near-native state ultrastructure of infected cells.",

The presence of BSEs affects leaf hydraulics and photosynthetic rate. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) obscuravenosa (obv) mutant lacks BSEs. Here we identify the obv gene and the causative mutation, a non-synonymous amino acid change that disrupts a C2H2 zinc finger motif in a putative transcription factor. This mutation exists as a rare polymorphism in the natural range of wild tomatoes, but has increased in frequency in domesticated tomatoes, suggesting that the latter diversified into heterobaric and homobaric leaf types. The obv mutant displays reduced vein density, leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic assimilation rate. We show that these and other effects on plant development, including changes in leaf insertion angle, leaf margin serration, minor vein density and fruit shape, are controlled by OBV via changes in auxin signalling. Loss of function of the transcriptional regulator AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF4) also results in defective BSE development, revealing an additional component of a novel genetic module controlling aspects of leaf development important for ecological adaptation and subject to breeding selection.\n\nOne sentence summarydistribution of tomato heterobaric and homobaric leaves is controlled by a single-nucleotide polymorphism in an auxin-related transcription factor",

Photosynthetic processes are governed by the circadian clock in both flowering plants and some cyanobacteria, but it is unclear how extensively this is conserved throughout the green lineage. We investigated the contribution of circadian regulation to aspects of photosynthesis in Marchantia polymorpha, a liverwort that diverged from flowering plants early in the evolution of land plants. First, we identified in M. polymorpha the circadian regulation of photosynthetic biochemistry, measured using two approaches (delayed fluorescence, PAM fluorescence). Second, we identified that light-dark cycles synchronize the phase of 24 h cycles of photosynthesis in M. polymorpha, whereas the phases of different thalli desynchronize under free running conditions. This might also be due to masking of the underlying circadian rhythms of photosynthesis by light-dark cycles. Finally, we used a pharmacological approach to identify that chloroplast translation might be necessary for clock control of light harvesting in M. polymorpha. We infer that the circadian regulation of photosynthesis are well-conserved amongst terrestrial plants.",

The point mutation M1875T in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the -subunit of the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5, has been associated with increased atrial excitability and familial AF.\n\n(2) MethodsWe designed a new murine model carrying the Scn5a-M1875T mutation enabling us to study the effects of the Nav1.5 mutation in detail in vivo and in vitro using patch clamp and microelectrode recording of atrial cardiomyocytes, optical mapping, ECG, echocardiography, gravimetry, histology and biochemistry.\n\n(3) ResultsAtrial cardiomyocytes from newly generated adult Scn5a-M1875T+/- mice showed a selective increase in the early (peak) cardiac sodium current, larger action potential amplitude and a faster peak upstroke velocity. Conduction slowing caused by the sodium channel blocker flecainide was less pronounced in Scn5a-M1875T+/- compared to wildtype atria. Overt hypertrophy or heart failure in Scn5a-M1875T+/- mice could be excluded.\n\n(4) ConclusionThe Scn5a-M1875T point mutation causes gain-of-function of the cardiac sodium channel. Our results suggest increased atrial peak sodium current as a potential trigger for increased atrial excitability and thus AF.\n\nWhats newO_LIThe point mutation M1875T in the C-terminal domain of the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 causes an increase in early peak sodium current in left atria.\nC_LIO_LIThe observed changes induced by this point mutation suggest an increase in peak sodium current as a cause of familial atrial fibrillation (AF).\nC_LIO_LIOur findings provide a possible explanation for the variable effectiveness of sodium channel blockers in patients with AF.

    "abstract": "Lifelong learning is the ability to continually acquire new information and build upon existing knowledge. Biological and artificial neurons gain and refine internal representations by modifying synaptic weights, but it is unclear how previous knowledge remains stable in spite of ongoing plasticity. Here we show that cortical pyramidal neurons solve this plasticity-stability dilemma by differentially regulating synaptic plasticity within dendritic compartments. We found that oblique dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in adult mouse primary visual cortex (V1) selectively receive monosynaptic input from dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), integrate linearly, and--surprisingly--lack synaptic potentiation. In contrast, basal dendrites, which do not receive dLGN input, exhibit conventional NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated supralinear integration and synaptic potentiation. Both dendritic compartments initially express NMDAR-mediated supralinear integration and synaptic potentiation during development, but oblique dendritic properties diverge after a critical period of early visual experience. This developmental transition was accompanied by a decrease in relative NMDAR receptor activity and expression at spiny synapses on oblique dendrites. Our results demonstrate a new biological mechanism for how single neurons can safeguard inputs from ongoing experience-dependent plasticity by altering synaptic properties of dendritic domains.",

    "abstract": "While genome databases are nearing a complete catalog of species commonly inhabiting the human gut, their representation of intraspecific diversity is lacking for all but the most abundant and frequently studied taxa. Statistical deconvolution of allele frequencies from shotgun metagenomic data into strain genotypes and relative abundances is a promising approach, but existing methods are limited by computational scalability. Here we introduce StrainFacts, a method for strain deconvolution that enables inference across tens of thousands of metagenomes. We harness a \"fuzzy\" genotype approximation that makes the underlying graphical model fully differentiable, unlike existing methods. This allows parameter estimates to be optimized with gradient-based methods, speeding up model fitting by two orders of magnitude. A GPU implementation provides additional scalability. Extensive simulations show that StrainFacts can perform strain inference on thousands of metagenomes and has comparable accuracy to more computationally intensive tools. We further validate our strain inferences using single-cell genomic sequencing from a human stool sample. Applying StrainFacts to a collection of more than 10,000 publicly available human stool metagenomes, we quantify patterns of strain diversity, biogeography, and linkage-disequilibrium that agree with and expand on what is known based on existing reference genomes. StrainFacts paves the way for large-scale biogeography and population genetic studies of microbiomes using metagenomic data.",

    "abstract": "At present, prioritizing cancer treatments at the individual patient level remains challenging, and performing co-clinical studies using patient-derived models in real-time is often not feasible. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OncoLoop, a precision medicine framework to predict and validate drug sensitivity in human tumors and their pre-existing high-fidelity (cognate) model(s) by leveraging perturbational profiles of clinically-relevant oncology drugs. As proof-of-concept, we applied OncoLoop to prostate cancer (PCa) using a series of genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that recapitulate a broad spectrum of disease states, including castration-resistant, metastatic, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Interrogation of published cohorts using Master Regulator (MR) conservation analysis revealed that most patients were represented by at least one cognate GEMM-derived tumor (GEMM-DT). Drugs predicted to invert MR activity in patients and their cognate GEMM-DTs were successfully validated, including in two cognate allografts and one cognate patient-derived xenograft (PDX). OncoLoop is a highly generalizable framework that can be extended to other cancers and potentially other diseases.\n\nSignificance StatementOncoLoop is a transcriptomic-based experimental and computational framework that can support rapid-turnaround co-clinical studies to identify and validate drugs for individual patients, which can then be readily adapted to clinical practice. This framework should be applicable in many cancer contexts for which appropriate models and drug perturbation data are available.",

    "abstract": "KIF5A is a kinesin superfamily motor protein that transports various cargos in neurons. Mutations in Kif5a cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These ALS mutations are in the intron of Kif5a and induce mis-splicing of KIF5A mRNA, leading to splicing out of exon 27, which in human KIF5A encodes the cargo-binding tail domain of KIF5A. Therefore, it has been suggested that ALS is caused by loss of function of KIF5A. However, the precise mechanisms regarding how mutations in KIF5A cause ALS remain unclear. Here, we show that an ALS-associated mutant of KIF5A, KIF5A({Delta}exon27), is predisposed to form oligomers and aggregates in cultured mouse cell lines. Interestingly, purified KIF5A({Delta}exon27) oligomers showed more active movement on microtubules than wild type KIF5A in vitro. Purified KIF5A({Delta}exon27) was prone to form aggregates in vitro. Moreover, KIF5A({Delta}exon27)-expressing Caenorhabditis elegans neurons showed morphological defects. These data collectively suggest that ALS-associated mutations of KIF5A are toxic gain-of-function mutations rather than simple loss-of-function mutations.",

We used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize a long-lived misfolded state in the folding pathway of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, a paradigmatic RNA structure-function model system. The structure revealed how this state forms native-like secondary structure and tertiary contacts but contains two incorrectly crossed strands, consistent with a previous model. This incorrect topology mispositions a critical catalytic domain and cannot be resolved locally, as extensive refolding is required.

    "abstract": "During cell division, the spindle generates force to move chromosomes. In mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et al. 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fibers response to force remain unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes, but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 m length scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles. Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at poles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose are key for function.",

    "abstract": "Sloths have a dense coat on which insects, algae, and fungi coexist in a symbiotic relationship. This complex ecosystem requires different levels of control, however, most of these mechanisms remain unknown. We investigated the bacterial communities inhabiting the hair of two- (Choloepus Hoffmani) and three-toed (Bradypus variegatus) sloths and evaluated their potential for producing antibiotic molecules capable of exerting control over the hair microbiota. The analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) revealed that the communities in both host species are dominated by Actinobacteriota and Firmicutes. The most abundant genera were Brevibacterium, Kocuria/Rothia, Staphylococcus, Rubrobacter, Nesterenkonia, and Janibacter. In addition, we isolated nine strains of Brevibacterium and Rothia able to produce substances that inhibited the growth of common mammalian pathogens. The analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BCGs) of these nine isolates suggests that the pathogen-inhibitory activity could be mediated by the presence of siderophores, terpenes, beta-lactones, Type III polyketide synthases (T3PKS), ribosomally synthesized, and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), non-alpha poly-amino acids (NAPAA) like e-Polylysin, ectoine or nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). Our data suggest that Micrococcales inhabiting sloth hair could have a role in controlling microbial populations in that habitat, improving our understanding of this highly complex ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Photoperiod drives metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT), and affects food intake and weight gain in mammals. Sympathetic innervation in BAT controls thermogenesis and facilitates physiological adaption to seasons, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Previous studies show that the central opioid signaling tunes BAT heating and the brain muopioid receptor (MOR) levels have seasonal patterns. It is hence intriguing to know whether the peripheral MOR signaling shows seasonal variation. Here, we examined the effect of photoperiod on BAT MOR availability using [11C]carfentanil positron emission topography (PET). Adult rats (n = 9) were repeatedly imaged under changing photoperiods which simulates the local seasons. Long photoperiod downregulated MOR availability in BAT, while MOR availability in the muscles was unaffected. We confirmed the expression of MOR in BAT and muscle using immunofluorescence imaging. We conclude that photoperiod causally affects MOR availability in BAT, and sympathetic innervation of BAT may influence thermogenesis via the peripheral MOR system.\n\nSignificance of the studyPhotoperiod impacts the metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) with the exact mechanism still unclear. The current study shows that photoperiod causally affects the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) levels in BAT, with longer photoperiod leading to lower MOR availability. This possibly indicates down-regulated innervation during bright seasons. Immunofluorescence staining data reveal expression of MOR in both brain and peripheral tissues, drawing attention to the under-investigated peripheral MOR system. Also, the study highlights the feasibility of [11C]carfentanil PET in studying the peripheral MOR signaling.",

    "abstract": "Francisella tularensis is an extremely infectious pathogen and a category A bioterrorism agent. It causes the highly contagious zoonosis, Tularemia. Currently, FDA approved vaccines against tularemia are unavailable. F. tularensis outer membrane protein A (FopA) is a well-studied virulence determinant and protective antigen against tularemia. It is a major outer membrane protein (Omp) of F. tularensis. However, FopA-based therapeutic intervention is hindered due to lack of complete structural information for membrane localized mature FopA. In our study, we established recombinant expression, monodisperse purification, crystallization and X-ray diffraction ([~]6.5 [A]) of membrane localized mature FopA. Further, we performed bioinformatics and biophysical experiments to unveil its structural organization in the outer membrane. FopA consists of 393 amino acids and has less than 40% sequence identity to known bacterial Omps. Using comprehensive sequence alignments and structure predictions together with existing partial structural information, we propose a two-domain organization for FopA. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and heat modifiability assay confirmed FopA has a {beta}-barrel domain consistent with alphafold2s prediction of an eight stranded {beta}-barrel at the N-terminus. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed FopA purified in detergent micelles is predominantly dimeric. Molecular density derived from SAXS at 31 [A] shows putative dimeric N-terminal {beta}-barrels surrounded by detergent corona and connected to C-terminal domains via flexible linker. Disorder analysis predicts N- and C-terminal domains are interspersed by a long intrinsically disordered region and alphafold2 predicts this region to be largely unstructured. Taken together, we propose a dimeric, two-domain organization of FopA in the outer membrane: the N-terminal {beta}-barrel is membrane embedded, provides dimerization interface and tethers to membrane extrinsic C-terminal domain via long flexible linker. Structure determination of membrane localized mature FopA is essential to understand its role in pathogenesis and develop anti-tularemia therapeutics. Our results pave the way towards it.",

The mechanisms whereby pancreatic {beta} cells adapt to pubertal insulin resistance, and how they are affected by the metabolic status, have not been investigated. Here we show that puberty is associated with a transient increase in {beta}-cell proliferation in rats and humans of both sexes. In rats, {beta}-cell proliferation correlated with a rise in growth hormone (GH) levels. Serum from pubertal rats and humans promoted {beta}-cell proliferation, suggesting the implication of a circulating factor. In pubertal rat islets, expression of genes of the GH/serotonin (5-HT) pathway underwent changes consistent with proliferative effect. Inhibition of the pro-proliferative 5-HT receptor isoform HTR2b blocked the increase in {beta}-cell proliferation in pubertal islets ex vivo and in vivo. Peri-pubertal metabolic stress blunted {beta}-cell proliferation during puberty and led to altered glucose homeostasis later in life. This study identifies a role of GH/GHR/5-HT/HTR2b signaling in the control of {beta}-cell mass expansion during puberty and a mechanistic link between pubertal obesity and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state fMRI studies have revealed that individuals exhibit stable, functionally meaningful divergences in large-scale network organization. The locations with strongest deviations (called network  variants) have a characteristic spatial distribution, with qualitative evidence from prior reports suggesting that this distribution differs across hemispheres. Hemispheric asymmetries can inform us on constraints guiding the development of these idiosyncratic regions. Here, we used data from the Human Connectome Project to systematically investigate hemispheric differences in network variants. Variants were significantly larger in the right hemisphere, particularly along the frontal operculum and medial frontal cortex. Variants in the left hemisphere appeared most commonly around the temporoparietal junction. We investigated how variant asymmetries vary by functional network and how they compare with typical network distributions. For some networks, variants seemingly increase group-average network asymmetries (e.g., the group-average language network is slightly bigger in the left hemisphere and variants also appeared more frequently in that hemisphere). For other networks, variants counter the group-average network asymmetries (e.g., the default mode network is slightly bigger in the left hemisphere, but variants were more frequent in the right hemisphere). Intriguingly, left- and right-handers differed in their network variant asymmetries for the cinguloopercular and frontoparietal networks, suggesting that variant asymmetries are connected to lateralized traits. These findings demonstrate that idiosyncratic aspects of brain organization differ systematically across the hemispheres. We discuss how these asymmetries in brain organization may inform us on developmental constraints of network variants, and how they may relate to functions differentially linked to the two hemispheres.",

    "abstract": "Antibody CIS43 binds Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and protects against malaria, as recently demonstrated clinically. To improve the efficacy of CIS43, we developed an in silico pipeline to optimize the interaction energy of CIS43 to its junctional epitope (peptide 21: PfCSP residues 101-115). Starting from two improved CIS43 variants, recently elicited from a CIS43-germline knock-in mice, single and double amino acid substitutions in the peptide 21-proximal heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable regions were introduced. CIS43-variants, selected on the basis of improved in silico interface and stability energies, showed increased affinity to peptide 21 and superior malaria-protective efficacy. The best designed variant, antibody P3-43, was significantly more protective than its template antibody m43.151, with greater liver-burden protection than the current best-in-class (antibody iGL-CIS43.D3). Crystal structures of improved antibodies revealed atomic-level interactions explaining gains in binding affinity. The reported pipeline provides a powerful in silico approach to improve antibody functionality.",

    "abstract": "Cholera is an acute watery diarrheal disease that causes high rates of morbidity and mortality without treatment. Early detection of the etiologic agent of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae is important to mobilize treatment and mitigate outbreaks. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) enable early detection in settings without laboratory capacity. However, the odds of an RDT testing positive are reduced by nearly 90% when the common virulent bacteriophage ICP1 is present. We hypothesize that adding a mAb for the common, and specific, virulent bacteriophage ICP1 as a proxy for V. cholerae to an RDT will increase diagnostic sensitivity when virulent ICP1 phage are present. In this study, we used an in-silico approach to identify immunogenic ICP1 protein targets that were conserved across disparate time periods and locations. Specificity of targets to cholera patients with known ICP1 was determined, and specific targets were used to produce mAbs in a murine model. Candidate mAbs to the head protein demonstrated specificity to ICP1 by ELISA and an ICP1 phage neutralization assay. The limit of detection of the final mAb candidate for ICP1 phage particles spiked into cholera stool matrix was 8 x 105 plaque forming units by Western blot analysis. This mAb will be incorporated into a RDT prototype for evaluation in a future diagnostic study to test the guiding hypothesis behind this study.",

Machine learning showed an outstanding performance, explaining up to 80.9% of species richness and 83.3% of phylogenetic richness. Current climate and environmental heterogeneity emerged as the primary drivers, while past environmental conditions left only small but detectable imprints on plant diversity. Finally, we combined predictions from multiple modelling techniques (ensemble predictions) to reveal global patterns and centres of plant diversity at multiple resolutions down to 7,774 km2. Our predictive maps provide the most accurate estimates of global plant diversity available to date at grain sizes relevant for conservation and macroecology.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Fusarium root rot (FRR) are important diseases of small-grained cereals caused by Fusarium species. While host response to FHB has been subject to extensive study, very little is known about response to FRR and the transcriptome responses of FHB and FRR have not been thoroughly compared. Brachypodium distachyon (Bd) is an effective model for investigating host responses to both FHB and FRR. In this study the transcriptome response of Bd to F. graminearum (Fg) infection of heads and roots was investigated. An RNA-seq analysis was performed on both Bd FHB and FRR during the early infection. Additionally, an RNA-seq analysis was performed on in vitro samples of Fg for comparison with Fg gene expression in planta. Differential gene expression and gene-list enrichment analyses were used to compare FHB and FRR transcriptome responses in both Bd and Fg. Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed using RT-qPCR. Most genes associated with receptor signalling, cell-wall modification, oxidative stress metabolism, and cytokinin and auxin biosynthesis and signalling genes were generally upregulated in FHB or were downregulated in FRR. In contrast, Bd genes involved in jasmonic acid and ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, and antimicrobial production were similarly differentially expressed in both tissues in response to infection. A transcriptome analysis of predicted Fg effectors with the same infected material revealed elevated expression of both core tissue- independent genes including cell-wall degradation enzymes and the gene cluster for DON production but also several tissue-dependent genes including those for aurofusarin production and cutin degradation. This evidence suggests that Fg modulates its transcriptome to different tissues of the same host.",

As a result, a large amount of eQTL data has been generated for this model plant; however, only a few causal eQTL genes have been identified, and experimental validation is costly and laborious. A prioritization method could help speed up the identification of causal eQTL genes. This study extends the machine-learning-based QTG-Finder2 method for prioritizing candidate causal genes in phenotype QTLs to be used for eQTLs by adding gene structure, protein interaction, and gene expression. Independent validation shows that the new algorithm can prioritize sixteen out of twenty-five potential eQTL causal genes within the 20% rank percentile. Several new features are important in prioritizing causal eQTL genes, including the number of protein-protein interactions, unique domains, and introns. Overall, this study provides a foundation for developing computational methods to prioritize candidate eQTL causal genes. The prediction of all genes is available in the AraQTL workbench (https://www.bioinformatics.nl/AraQTL/) to support the identification of gene expression regulators in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Leaf margins are complex plant morphological features and contribute to the diversity of leaf shapes which effect on plant structure, yield and adaptation. Although several regulators of leaf margins have been identified, the genetic basis of natural variation therein has not been fully elucidated. We first profiled two distinct types (serration and smooth) of leaf morphology using the persistent homology mathematical framework (PHMF) in poplar. Combined genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait nucleotide (eQTN) mapping to create a module of leaf morphology controlling using data from Populus tomentosa and P. simonii association population, respectively. Natural variation of leaf margins is associated with transcript abundances of YABBY11 (YAB11) in poplar. In P. tomentosa, PtoYAB11 carries premature stop codon (PtoYAB11PSC) resulting in lost its positive regulation in PtoNGAL-1, PtoRBCL, PtoATPA, PtoATPE, and PtoPSBB. Overexpression of PtoYAB11PSC serrated leaf margin, enlarged leaves, promoted photosynthesis and increased biomass. Overexpression of PsiYAB11 in P. tomentosa could rescue leaf margin serration and increase stomatal density and light damage repair ability. In poplar, YAB11-NGAL1is sensitive to environmental conditions and play positive regulator of leaf margin serration. It might be important regulator which bridge environment signaling to leaf morphological plasticity.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most toxic DNA damage for cells. Homologous recombination (HR) is a precise DSB repair mechanism as well as a basis for gene targeting using genome-editing techniques. Despite the importance of HR, the HR mechanism in plants is poorly understood. In a genetic screen for DNA Damage Response Mutants (DDRMs), we find that the Arabidopsis ddrm2 mutant is hypersensitive to DSB-inducing reagents. DDRM2 encodes a protein with four BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains and is highly conserved in plants including the earliest land plant linage, bryophytes. The plant-specific transcription factor SOG1 binds to the promoter of DDRM2 and activates its expression, suggesting that DDRM2 is a direct target of SOG1. In consistence, the expression of DDRM2 is induced by DSBs in a SOG1-dependent manner. Epistasis analysis indicates that DDRM2 functions downstream of SOG1. Similar to the sog1 mutant, the ddrm2 mutant shows dramatically reduced HR efficiency. Our study suggests that the SOG1-DDRM2 module is required for HR, providing new insights into the HR mechanisms in plants and a potential target for improving the efficiency of gene targeting.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA genetic screen in Arabidopsis reveals that the multi-BRCT domain protein DDRM2 is required for homologous recombination and is targeted by the master DNA damage response regulator SOG1.",

Outside of spawning the populations form mixed aggregations, which are the subject of acoustic surveys. The inability to distinguish the populations has prevented the development of separate survey indices and separate stock assessments. A panel of 45 SNPs, derived from whole genome sequencing, were used to genotype 3,480 baseline spawning samples (2014-2021). A temporally stable baseline comprising 2,316 herring from populations known to inhabit Division 6.a was used to develop a genetic assignment method, with a self-assignment accuracy >90%. The long-term temporal stability of the assignment model was validated by assigning archive (2003-2004) baseline samples (270 individuals) with a high level of accuracy. Assignment of non-baseline samples (1,514 individuals) from Division 6.a, 7.b-c indicated previously unrecognised levels of mixing of populations outside of the spawning season. The genetic markers and assignment models presented constitute a  toolbox that can be used for the assignment of herring caught in mixed survey and commercial catches in Division 6.a into their population of origin with a high level of accuracy.",

Here we investigated byproduct benefits, which occur when traits that increase the fitness of one species provide incidental benefits to another species with no direct cost to the provider species. In experimental mesocosms, microbial traits predicted plant responses to soil moisture such that bacteria with self-beneficial traits in drought increased plant early growth, size at reproduction, and chlorophyll concentration under drought, while bacteria with self-beneficial traits in well-watered environments increased these same plant traits in well-watered environments. Thus, microbial traits that promote microbial success in different soil moisture environments also promote plant success in these same environments. Our results show that the concept of byproduct benefits, originally conceived to explain the evolution of cooperation in pairwise mutualisms, also applies to interactions between plants and non-symbiotic soil microbes.",

    "abstract": "Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) result in blindness due to apoptotic cell death of rods and cones, but spare other retinal neurons, providing a potential that delivery of a light-activated signaling protein to surviving neurons may restore vision. We previously demonstrated that aspects of vision could be restored by introduction into surviving cells of a G protein-coupled receptor for glutamate (mGluR) bearing a tethered photoswitchable agonist. However, this system, containing one photoswitchable agonist per glutamate binding site, yielded low sensitivity, responding only to visual stimuli at the intensity of bright outdoor light, similar to channelrhodopsins. To increase sensitivity, we designed a multi-branched photoswitch, bearing four light-activatable glutamates for each glutamate binding site. When tethered to a modified mGluR2 expressed in retinal ganglion cells via intravitreal AAV gene delivery, this photoswitch boosted sensitivity by ~100-fold compared to the unbranched (single photo-ligand) photoswitch. This improvement in sensitivity enabled an IRD mouse model (rd1) to perform visually-guided object recognition under incidental room light and pattern recognition using standard LCD computer displays. The restored line pattern differentiation approached the acuity reported for normal mouse vision. Pattern recognition functioned as well as wildtype vision with line patterns moving at speeds of up to 36{degrees}/s. In summary, this two-component chemical-optogenetic approach combines high sensitivity and high acuity with superior motion vision, and, unlike optogenetic gene therapy, can be adjusted for dose, upgraded, as new photoswitches are developed, and discontinued at will.",

We made nine CRISPR/Cas9 constructs with various promoters driving the expression of a Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) or a plant codon-optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (pcoCas9). We developed a fast and efficient system for evaluating the variety and frequency of mutations caused by each construct using Brassica napus hairy roots. We showed that pcoCas9 is more efficient in mutating the targeted loci than SaCas9 and the presence of the NLS signal enhanced the chance of mutagenesis by 25%. The mutations were studied further in regenerated lines, and we determined the BnaTAA1 gene expression and heritability of the gene modifications in transgenic plants. Hairy root transformation combined with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing represents a fast and straightforward system for studying target gene function in the important oilseed crop Brassica napus.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThe hairy root transformation system of Brassica napus generates stable transformants and is a tool for efficiently identifying CRISPR/Cas9-induced genome editing.",

    "abstract": "The exchange of bacterial extracellular vesicles facilitates molecular exchange between cells, including the horizontal transfer of genetic material. Given the implications of such transfer events on cell physiology and adaptation, some bacterial cells have likely evolved mechanisms to regulate vesicle exchange. Past work has identified mechanisms that regulate the formation of extracellular vesicles, including the production of small molecules that modulate membrane structure, however whether these mechanisms also regulate vesicle uptake and have an overall impact on the rate of vesicle exchange is unknown. Here we show that membrane-binding molecules produced by microbes regulate both the formation and uptake of extracellular vesicles and have the overall impact of increasing the vesicle exchange rate within a bacterial coculture. In effect, production of compounds that influence vesicle exchange rates enable cells to steal genes from neighboring cells. The ability of several membrane-binding compounds to regulate vesicle exchange was demonstrated. Three of these compounds, nisin, colistin, and polymyxin B, are antimicrobial peptides added at sub-inhibitory concentrations. These results suggest that a key function of exogenous compounds that bind to membranes may be the regulation of vesicle exchange between cells.\n\nImportanceThe exchange of bacterial extracellular vesicles is one route of gene transfer between bacteria, although it was unclear if bacteria developed strategies to regulate the rate of gene transfer within vesicles. In eukaryotes, there are many examples of specialized molecules that have evolved to facilitate the production, loading, and uptake of vesicles. Recent work with bacteria has shown that some small molecules influence membrane curvature and induce vesicle formation. Here we show that similar compounds facilitate vesicle uptake, thereby regulating the overall rate of vesicle exchange within bacterial populations. The addition of membrane-binding compounds, several of them antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations, to a bacterial co-culture increased the rate of horizontal gene transfer via vesicle exchange.",

Using a bovine model, we profiled changes in two activating (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) and two repressive (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) marks in oocytes, 2-, 4- and 8-cell embryos (that developed in the presence or absence of the transcription inhibitor a-amanitin), morula, blastocysts, inner cell mass cells and trophectoderm. In oocytes, we find that broad bivalent domains of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 mark developmental genes, and that prior to genome activation, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 co-occupy gene bodies. During genome activation, chromatin accessibility is established before canonical H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and although embryonic transcription is required for this active remodeling, it is dispensable for maintenance of pre-established histone marks. Finally, blastocyst lineages are defined by differential Polycomb repression and transcription factor activity.

They are confined from the cytosol by an envelope consisting of two membranes. Signals, metabolites, proteins and lipids have to be transferred across these membranes via proteinaceous contact sites to keep mitochondria functional. In the present study we identified a novel mitochondrial contact site that is formed by the inner membrane protein Cqd1 and the outer membrane proteins Por1 and Om14. Similar to the mitochondrial porin, Por1, Cqd1 is highly conserved, suggesting that this complex is conserved in form and function from yeast to human. Cqd1 is a member of the UbiB protein kinase-like family (also called aarF domain containing kinases). It was recently shown that Cqd1 in cooperation with Cqd2 controls the cellular distribution of coenzyme Q by a yet unknown mechanism. Our data suggest that Cqd1 in addition is involved in the homeostasis of phospholipids and contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and architecture.\n\nSummary statementHere, we show that the conserved mitochondrial inner membrane protein Cqd1 interacts with the outer membrane proteins Por1 and Om14.

    "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have great potential in cell-based therapies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their self-renewal and multipotent properties. Recent studies indicate that Notch1-Dll4 signaling is an important pathway in regulating osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. However, the fundamental mechanisms that govern osteogenic differentiation are poorly understood due to a lack of effective tools to detect gene expression at single cell level. Here, we established a double-stranded locked nucleic acid (LNA)/DNA (LNA/DNA) nanobiosensor for gene expression analysis in single hMSC in both 2D and 3D microenvironments. We first characterized this LNA/DNA nanobiosensor and demonstrated the Dll4 mRNA expression dynamics in hMSCs during osteogenic differentiation. By incorporating this nanobiosensor with live hMSCs imaging during osteogenic induction, we performed dynamic tracking of hMSCs differentiation and Dll4 mRNA gene expression profiles of individual hMSC during osteogenic induction. Our results showed the dynamic expression profile of Dll4 during osteogenesis, indicating the heterogeneity of hMSCs during this dynamic process. We further investigated the role of Notch1-Dll4 signaling in regulating hMSCs during osteogenic differentiation. Pharmacological perturbation is applied to disrupt Notch1-Dll4 signaling to investigate the molecular mechanisms that govern osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the effects of Notch1-Dll4 signaling on hMSCs spheroids differentiation were also investigated. Our results provide convincing evidence supporting that Notch1-Dll4 signaling is involved in regulating hMSCs osteogenic differentiation. Specifically, Notch1-Dll4 signaling is active during osteogenic differentiation. Our results also showed that Dll4 is a molecular signature of differentiated hMSCs during osteogenic induction. Notch inhibition mediated osteogenic differentiation with reduced Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity. Lastly, we elucidated the role of Notch1-Dll4 signaling during osteogenic differentiation in a 3D spheroid model. Our results showed that Notch1-Dll4 signaling is required and activated during osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs spheroids. Inhibition of Notch1-Dll4 signaling mediated osteogenic differentiation and enhanced hMSCs proliferation, with increased spheroid sizes. Taken together, the capability of LNA/DNA nanobiosensor to probe gene expression dynamics during osteogenesis, combined with the engineered 2D/3D microenvironment, enables us to study in detail the role of Notch1-Dll4 signaling in regulating osteogenesis in 2D and 3D microenvironment. These findings will provide new insights to improve cell-based therapies and organ repair techniques.",

Their ability to load and deliver small molecule drugs has not been reported yet. We propose that the delivery of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to brain endothelial cells (BECs) lining the blood-brain barrier may increase cellular energetics of the injured BECs. We formulated and studied the physicochemical characteristics of ATP-loaded LNPs using the C12-200 ionizable cationic lipid and other helper lipids. Polyethylene glycol-dimyristoyl glycerol (PEG-DMG), one of the helper lipids, played a crucial role in maintaining colloidal stability of LNPs over time whereas the inclusion of both ATP and PEG-DMG maintained the colloidal stability of LNPs in the presence of serum proteins. ATP-LNPs formulated with PEG-DMG resulted in a 7.7- and 6.6-fold increased uptake of ATP into normoxic and hypoxic BECs, respectively.

While potential design strategies exist to address translational challenges, including the lack of unique tumor antigens and the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, testing all possible design choices in vitro and in vivo is prohibitively expensive, time consuming, and laborious. To address this gap, we extended the modeling framework ARCADE (Agent-based Representation of Cells And Dynamic Environments) to include CAR T-cell agents (CAR T-cell ARCADE, or CARCADE). We conducted in silico experiments to investigate how clinically relevant design choices and inherent tumor features--CAR T-cell dose, CD4+:CD8+ CAR T-cell ratio, CAR-antigen affinity, cancer and healthy cell antigen expression--individually and collectively impact treatment outcomes. Our analysis revealed that tuning CAR affinity modulates IL-2 production by balancing CAR T-cell proliferation and effector function. It also identified a novel multi-feature tuned treatment strategy for balancing selectivity and efficacy and provided insights into how spatial effects can impact relative treatment performance in different contexts. CARCADE facilitates deeper biological understanding of treatment design and could ultimately enable identification of promising treatment strategies to accelerate solid tumor CAR T-cell design-build-test cycles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRandom Forests (RF) are a widely used modelling tool, enabling feature-selection via a variable importance measure. For this, a threshold is required that separates label-associated features from false positives. In the absence of a good understanding of the characteristics of the variable importance measures, current approaches attempt to select features by training multiple RFs to generate statistical power via a permutation null, employ recursive feature elimination or a combination of both. However, for high-dimensional datasets, such as genome data with millions of variables, this is computationally infeasible.\n\nMethodWe present RFlocalfdr, a statistical approach for thresholding that identifies which features are significantly associated with the prediction label and reduces false positives. It builds on the empirical Bayes argument of Efron (2005) and models the variable importance as mixture of two distributions - null and non-null \"genes.\"\n\nResultWe demonstrate on synthetic data that RFlocalfdr has an equivalent accuracy to computationally more intensive approaches, while being up to 100 times faster. RFlocalfdr is the only tested method able to successfully threshold a dataset with 6 Million features and 10,000 samples. RFlocalfdr performs analysis in real-time and is compatible with any RF implementation that returns variable importance and counts, such as ranger or VariantSpark.\n\nConclusionRFlocalfdr allows for robust feature selection by placing a confidence value on the predicted importance score. It does so without repeated fitting of the RF or the use of additional shadow variables and is thus usable for data sets with very large numbers of variables.",

We present a method for estimating the genotype error rate from parent-offspring trios and a method for estimating the bias in the observed switch error rate that is caused by genotype error. We apply these methods to 485,301 genotyped UK Biobank samples that include 899 White British trios and to 38,387 sequenced TOPMed samples that include 217 African Caribbean trios and 669 European American trios. We show that genotype error inflates the observed switch error rate and that the relative bias increases with sample size. For the UK Biobank White British trios, we estimate that the observed switch error rate in the trio offspring is 2.4 times larger than the true switch error rate (1.41 x 10-3 vs 5.79 x 10-4) and that the average distance between phase errors is 64 megabases.",

    "abstract": "The consequences of perinatal brain injury can be devastating but currently there are few effective treatments. We sought to determine if tactile stimulation (TS) or exogenous application of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) following injury could reverse the behavioral loss. Infant rats received frontal cortex removals on postnatal day 4 (P4) or a sham surgery. The TS animals received thrice-daily 15-minute bouts of stimulation (Experiment 1) on the day following surgery until weaning. In Experiment 2, treated animals received subcutaneous injections of FGF-2 once daily for one week, postsurgery. Behavioral testing began on postnatal day 60. Brains were later processed for Golgi analysis. We show in Experiment 1, that tactilely stimulating infant rats with perinatal cortical injury stimulates functional recovery and reverses injury-related changes in neuronal morphology in the cerebral cortex. The TS induction of recovery is associated with changes in expression of FGF-2 in both the skin and brain. Direct administration of FGF-2 (Experiment 2) is also effective in facilitating recovery, although not as completely as TS. These results suggest that early behavioral intervention after perinatal cortical injury can stimulate plastic neuronal changes that can underlie functional recovery and that these changes are mediated, in part, through an upregulation of FGF-2.",

Neural principles that govern these transitions are not well understood. C. elegans spontaneously switch between two opposite motor states, forward and backward movement, a phenomenon long thought to reflect the reciprocal inhibition between two interneurons that separately gate the forward and backward motor circuits, AVB and AVA. Combining experimental data and mathematical modeling, we report that spontaneous forward and backward locomotion and their corresponding motor circuits are not separately controlled. AVA and AVB are neither functionally equivalent nor strictly reciprocally inhibitory. Instead, while AVA phasically inhibits the forward promoting interneuron AVB at a fast timescale, it maintains a tonic, extrasynaptic excitation on AVB over the longer timescale. AVAs depolarized spontaneous membrane potential is necessary for this tonic excitation. We propose a new, master neuron model for locomotion. AVA, with tonic and phasic activity of opposite polarities on different time scales, acts as a master neuron to break the symmetry between the underlying forward and backward motor circuits. This offers a parsimonious solution for sustained locomotion consisted of mutually exclusive motor states.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMutually exclusive forward and backward motor states are inherently asymmetric\nC_LIO_LIForward and backward motor states are not separately controlled\nC_LIO_LIA master neuron underlies continuous modulation and transitions of opposing states\nC_LIO_LIA tonically active premotor interneuron functions as the master neuron\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The mediodorsal thalamus is a higher-order thalamic nucleus involved in a variety of cognitive behaviors, including olfactory attention, odor discrimination, and the hedonic perception of flavors. Although it forms connections with principal regions of the olfactory and gustatory networks, its role in processing olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth remains unclear. Here, we recorded single-unit activity in the mediodorsal thalamus of behaving rats during the intraoral delivery of individual odors, individual tastes, and odor-taste mixtures. Our results are the first to demonstrate that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus dynamically encode chemosensory signals originating from the mouth. This chemoselective population is broadly tuned, responds with excitation and suppression, and represents odor-taste mixtures differently than their odor and taste components. Furthermore, a subset of chemoselective neurons encoded taste palatability. Our results further demonstrate the multidimensionality of the mediodorsal thalamus and provides additional evidence of its involvement in processing chemosensory information important for consummatory behaviors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe perception of food relies upon the concurrent processing of olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth. The mediodorsal thalamus is a higher-order thalamic nucleus involved in a variety of chemosensory-dependent behaviors and connects the olfactory and gustatory cortices with prefrontal cortex. However, it is unknown how neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus process intraoral chemosensory signals. Using tetrode recordings in alert rats, our results are the first to show that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus dynamically represent olfactory and gustatory signals from the mouth. Our findings suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus is a key node between sensory and higher-order cortical areas for processing chemosensory information underlying consummatory behavior.",

    "abstract": "The lack of understanding as to the cellular and molecular basis of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) has hindered the search for new effective therapies and biomarkers. Here, to address this gap, we analysed 740,000 single nuclei RNAseq profiles of 165 samples of white matter (WM) lesions, normal appearing WM, grey matter (GM) lesions and normal appearing GM from 55 MS patients and 28 controls. We find that gene expression changes in response to MS are highly cell-type specific in WM and GM lesions but are largely shared within an individual cell-type across lesions, following a continuum rather than discrete lesion-specific molecular programs. The major biological determinants of variability in gene expression in MS samples relate to individual patient effects, rather than to lesion types or other metadata. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA+), we identify three subgroups of MS patients with distinct oligodendrocyte composition and WM glial gene expression signatures, suggestive of engagement of different pathological/regenerative processes. The discovery of these three patterns significantly advances our mechanistic understanding of progressive MS, provides a framework to use molecular biomarkers to stratify patients for best therapeutic approaches for progressive MS, and highlights the need for precision-medicine approaches to address heterogeneity among MS patients.",

    "abstract": "Corticospinal neurons (CSN) are centrally required for skilled voluntary movement, which necessitates that they establish precise subcerebral connectivity with the brainstem and spinal cord. However, molecular controls regulating specificity of this projection targeting remain largely unknown. We previously identified that developing CSN subpopulations exhibit striking axon targeting specificity in the spinal white matter. These CSN subpopulations with segmentally distinct spinal projections are also molecularly distinct; a subset of differentially expressed genes between these distinct CSN subpopulations function as molecular controls regulating differential axon projection targeting. Rostrolateral CSN extend axons exclusively to bulbar-cervical segments (CSNBC-lat), while caudomedial CSN (CSNmedial) are more heterogeneous, with distinct, intermingled subpopulations extending axons to either bulbar-cervical or thoraco-lumbar segments. Here, we report that Cerebellin 1 (Cbln1) is expressed specifically by CSN in medial, but not lateral, sensorimotor cortex. Cbln1 shows highly dynamic temporal expression, with Cbln1 levels in CSN highest during the period of peak axon extension toward thoraco-lumbar segments. Using gain-of-function experiments, we identify that Cbln1 is sufficient to direct thoraco-lumbar axon extension by CSN. Mis-expression of Cbln1 in CSNBC-lat either by in utero electroporation, or in postmitotic CSNBC-lat by AAV-mediated gene delivery, re-directs these axons past their normal bulbar-cervical targets toward thoracic segments. Further, Cbln1 overexpression in postmitotic CSNmedial increases the number of CSNmedial axons that extend past cervical segments into the thoracic cord. Collectively, these results identify that Cbln1 functions as a potent molecular control over thoraco-lumbar CSN axon extension, part of an integrated network of controls over segmentally-specific CSN axon projection targeting.\n\nSignificance StatementCorticospinal neurons (CSN) exhibit remarkable diversity and precision of axonal projections to targets in the brainstem and distinct spinal segments; the molecular basis for this targeting diversity is largely unknown. CSN subpopulations projecting to distinct targets are also molecularly distinguishable. Distinct subpopulations degenerate in specific motor neuron diseases, further suggesting that intrinsic molecular differences might underlie differential vulnerability to disease. Here, we identify a novel molecular control, Cbln1, expressed by CSN extending axons to thoraco-lumbar spinal segments. Cbln1 is sufficient, but not required, for CSN axon extension toward distal spinal segments, and Cbln1 expression is controlled by recently identified, CSN-intrinsic regulators of axon extension. Our results identify that Cbln1, together with other regulators, coordinates segmentally precise CSN axon targeting.",

Although single and complex spikes co-occur in the same neuron, their contribution to information processing remains unclear. We analyzed hippocampal CA1 neurons in awake mice and in behaving rats, combining cellular membrane voltage imaging with optogenetics and extracellular recordings. We found that network-driven subthreshold membrane rhythms in the theta versus gamma frequencies preferably entrained complex versus single spikes in individual neurons. Optogenetic membrane perturbation revealed a causal link between subthreshold theta and gamma power and the initiation of complex versus single spikes. Further, single and complex spikes exhibited different place field properties and frequency-dependent coding during spatial navigation. Thus, individual hippocampal neurons do not integrate theta and gamma rhythms into a combined spike timing code, but instead, transmit frequency-specific information as distinct output modes of single versus complex spikes during spatial cognition.",

However, questions have recently been raised about the accuracy of studies claiming efficient glia-to-neuron reprogramming in retina that were conducted using GFAP mini promoter-driven adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. In this study, we have addressed these questions using GFAP mini promoter-driven AAV constructs to simultaneously overexpress the mCherry reporter and candidate transcription factors predicted to induce glia-to-neuron conversion, in combination with prospective genetic labeling of retinal Muller glia using inducible Cre-dependent GFP reporters. We find that, while control GFAP-mCherry constructs express faithfully in Muller glia, 5 out of 7 transcription factor overexpression constructs tested are predominantly expressed in amacrine and retinal ganglion cells. However, genetic cell lineage analysis shows no evidence for glia-to-neuron conversion. These findings demonstrate strong insert-dependent effects on AAV-based GFAP mini promoter specificity that preclude its use in inferring cell lineage relationships when studying glia-to-neuron conversion in retina.",

Unfortunately, due to the frequent use of crude chitin preparations of unknown purity and degree of polymerization there is still great uncertainty how chitin activates different parts of the human immune system.\n\nObjectiveWe recently identified chitin oligomers of six GlcNAc units as the smallest immunologically active chitin motif and the innate immune receptor TLR2 as primary chitin sensor on human and murine myeloid cells, but the response of lymphoid cells to oligomeric chitin has not been investigated and was addressed here.\n\nMethodsFlow cytometric analysis of primary human immune cells upon stimulation with oligomeric chitin.

At the protein level, enhanced platelet activation was found in non-frail older adults, compared to young individuals both prior to and post-vaccine; but frail adults showed decreased platelet activation compared to non-frail that could reflect the influence of decreased translation RNA expression.

    "abstract": "While the human gut microbiome has been intensely studied, we have yet to obtain a sufficient understanding of the genetic diversity that it harbors. Research efforts have demonstrated that a considerable fraction of within-host genetic variation in the human gut is driven by the ecological dynamics of co-occurring strains belonging to the same species, suggesting that an ecological lens may provide insight into empirical patterns of genetic diversity. Indeed, an ecological model of self-limiting growth and environmental noise known as the Stochastic Logistic Model (SLM) was recently shown to successfully predict the temporal dynamics of strains within a single human host. However, its ability to predict patterns of genetic diversity across human hosts has yet to be tested. In this manuscript I determine whether the predictions of the SLM explain patterns of genetic diversity across unrelated human hosts for 22 common microbial species. Specifically, the stationary distribution of the SLM explains the distribution of allele frequencies across hosts and predicts the fraction of hosts harboring a given allele (i.e., prevalence) for a considerable fraction of sites. The accuracy of the SLM was correlated with independent estimates of strain structure, suggesting that patterns of genetic diversity in the gut microbiome follow statistically similar forms across human hosts due to the existence of strain-level ecology.",

    "abstract": "In fragmented forest landscapes, population persistence of arboreal species with limited dispersal ability may strongly depend on the quality of the remaining forest habitat. Using the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) as a model species, we studied habitat selection at two spatial scales (home range and within home range) in intensely managed woodlands at its northern distributional range in Denmark. We modelled selection at home range level as the conditional probability of occupancy of 588 nest boxes and nest tubes in 15 managed forests relative to habitat variables measured within 25 m radius. Habitat selection within home ranges was modelled by comparing habitat variables within 3 m radius of triangulated locations by 19 radio-tracked individuals (12 M, 7 F) when active at night with regularly distributed available locations within their home ranges.\n\nAt both spatial scales, hazel dormice strongly selected sites with high abundance-weighted species richness and high vegetation density of woody plants. On home range level, they furthermore selected for young tree vegetation, while they within home ranges selected for intermediate aged tree stands (maximum trunk circumference: 1.50 m). The predicted probability of presence in nest boxes or nest tubes varied from less than 1% to more than 99% as a combined function of three habitat variables. From May to October, selection for abundance-weighted species richness of woody plants of radio-tagged individuals decreased with date and body weight, suggesting that a diverse food base is particularly important early in their season of activity and for lean and small (growing) individuals. Selection for dense vegetation increased with body mass and mean available vegetation density within home ranges, indicating behavioural variability related to changes in energy expenditure and need for safety among individuals.\n\nThe study demonstrates that the hazel dormouse has specific habitat requirements related to food and safety that can be accommodated with relatively simple means in managed forests.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=73 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487322v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@649356org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104f975org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@195803borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e2ed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance poses a rising threat to global health, making it crucial to understand the routes of bacterial survival during antimicrobial treatments. Treatment failure can result from genetic or phenotypic mechanisms, which diminish the effect of antibiotics. By assembling empirical data, we find that, for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients frequently contain persisters, transiently non-growing and antibiotic-refractory subpopulations, and hyper-mutators, mutants with elevated mutation rates and thus higher probability of genetic resistance emergence. Resistance, persistence and hyper-mutation dynamics are difficult to disentangle experimentally. Hence, we use stochastic population modelling and deterministic fitness calculations of bacterial evolution under antibiotic treatment to investigate how genetic resistance and phenotypic mechanisms affect treatment success. We find that treatment failure is caused by resistant mutants at lower antibiotic concentrations (with high final bacterial numbers), but by persistence phenotypes at higher antibiotic concentrations (with low final bacterial numbers). Facilitation of resistance occurs through hyper-mutators during treatment, but through persistence only after treatment is discontinued, which allows for persisters to resume growth and evolve resistance in the absence of antibiotics. Our findings highlight the time- and concentration-dependence of different bacterial mechanisms to escape antibiotic killing, which should be considered when designing  resistance-proof antimicrobial treatments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFlavonols are the largest subgroup of flavonoids, possessing multiple functions in plants including protection against ultraviolet radiation, antimicrobial activities, and flower pigmentation together with anthocyanins. They are of agronomical and economical importance because the major off-taste component in rapeseed protein isolates is a flavonol derivative, which limits rapeseed protein use for human consumption. Flavonol production in Arabidopsis thaliana is mainly regulated by the subgroup 7 (SG7) R2R3-MYB transcription factors MYB11, MYB12, and MYB111. Recently, the SG19 MYBs MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57 were shown to regulate flavonol accumulation in pollen and stamens. The members of each subgroup are closely related, showing gene redundancy and tissue-specific expression in A. thaliana. However, the evolution of these flavonol regulators inside the Brassicaceae, especially inside the Brassiceae, which include the rapeseed crop species, is not fully understood.\n\nResultsWe studied the SG7 and SG19 MYBs in 44 species, including 31 species of the Brassicaceae, by phylogenetic analyses followed by synteny and gene expression analyses. Thereby we identified a deep MYB12 and MYB111 duplication inside the Brassicaceae, which likely occurred before the divergence of Brassiceae and Thelypodieae. These duplications of SG7 members were followed by the loss of MYB11 after the divergence of Eruca vesicaria from the remaining Brassiceae species. Similarly, MYB21 experienced duplication before the emergence of the Brassiceae family, where the gene loss of MYB24 is also proposed to have happened. Due to the overlapping spatio-temporal expression patterns of the SG7 and SG19 MYB members in B. napus, the loss of MYB11 and MYB24 is likely to be compensated by the remaining homologs.\n\nConclusionsWe identified a duplication of MYB12, MYB111, and MYB21 inside the Brassicaceae which is associated with MYB11 and MYB24 gene loss inside the tribe Brassiceae. We propose that gene redundancy and meso-polyploidization events have shaped the evolution of the flavonol regulators in the Brassicaceae, especially in the Brassiceae.",

We identified 21,392 cis-QTLs associated with expression and splicing changes across all five brain regions and validated their effects using allele specific expression data. We identified 80 cases where eQTLs were colocalized with genome-wide association study (GWAS) results from nine physiological traits. Comparing our dataset to human data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we found that the HS rat data yields twice as many significant eQTLs as a similarly sized human dataset. We also identified a modest but highly significant correlation between genetic regulatory variation among orthologous genes. Surprisingly, we found less genetic variation in gene regulation in HS rats relative to humans, though we still found eQTLs for the orthologs of many human genes for which eQTLs had not been found.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play key roles in cellular health and metabolism and are a critical determinant of the activation of multiple cell death processes. Although several pathways for regulating and re-establishing mitochondrial homeostasis have been identified within the past twenty years, large gaps remain in our understanding of how cells keep mitochondria healthy.\n\nTo address this limitation, have developed a network of genes that underlie mitochondrial health. We began by compiling a list of frequently mutated genes using publicly available data from multiple human cancer cell lines. RNAi was used to disrupt orthologous genes in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans in a series of assays to evaluate these genes ability to support mitochondrial health, as evidenced by precocious activation of mitochondrial autophagy and sensitivity to acute mitochondrial damage. Iterative screening of ~1000 genes yielded a network of 139 genes showing significant connectivity.\n\nFunctional validation of a panel of genes from the network indicated that disruption of each gene triggered at least one phenotype consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction, including increased fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, abnormal steady-state levels of ATP, NADH, or ROS, and altered oxygen consumption. Importantly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of these genes often exacerbated -synuclein aggregation in a C. elegans model of Parkinsons disease, indicating significant changes to cellular health. Additionally, human orthologs of the final mitochondrial health gene network showed enrichment for roles in a number of human disorders identified in the OMIM database. This gene network provides a foundation for identifying new mechanisms that support mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "In mitosis, sequences on sister chromatids are preferred as DNA repair templates, whereas in meiosis interhomolog-based repair is promoted. The switch of template preference during homologous recombinational (HR) repair of DNA breaks is a defining event in sexual reproduction. This preference is needed to establish linkages between homologous chromosomes that support meiotic chromosome segregation. In budding yeast, a central activity that enforces meiotic interhomolog bias is encoded in a meiosis-specific protein kinase complex, consisting of Red1, Hop1 and Mek1 (i.e., the RHM complex). Activation of Mek1 kinase in meiosis - dictated by complex formation and upstream DNA break-dependent signaling - leads to modification of HR factors and the establishment of interhomolog HR repair bias. How meiotic repair bias is established is a central question with implications for sexual reproduction, genetic diversity and genome stability. Studying the role of the RHM complex in DNA repair is complicated by the fact that Red1 and Hop1 are required for efficient meiotic DNA break formation. Here, we conditionally express RHM components in mitotically-dividing cells to show that these factors can autonomously establish the RHM complex outside of its physiological environment. In vivo analysis is complemented with in vitro biochemical reconstitution to analyze the composition of a Red1-Hop1 subcomplex. The RHM complex can be activated under DNA damaging conditions in mitotically-dividing cells, and activation depends on upstream Mec1 kinase function. We use this system to perform a structure-function analysis of RHM complex formation and Mek1 activation. Finally, we demonstrate that expressing active Mek1 in mitosis leads to rad51{Delta}-like DNA break sensitivity, suggesting that activation of the RHM complex is sufficient to reconstitute (parts of) its physiological function in mediating HR-based repair. This system should enable querying downstream effects of RHM complex action on DNA repair dynamics and template bias. Human homologs of Red1 and Hop1 are often aberrantly re-expressed in cancer cells. Our system has the potential to inform on (dys)functional effects of these genes on genome stability during human tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "O_LIA preference to associate with kin facilitates inclusive fitness benefits, and increased tolerance or cooperation between kin may be an added benefit of group living. Many species exhibit preferred associations with kin, however it is often hard to disentangle active preferences from passive overlap, for example caused by limited dispersal or inheritance of social position.\nC_LIO_LIMany parrots exhibit social systems consisting of pair-bonded individuals foraging in variably sized fission-fusion flocks within larger communal roosts of hundreds of individuals. Previous work has shown that, despite these fission-fusion dynamics, individuals can exhibit long-term preferred foraging associations outside their pair-bonds. Yet the underlying drivers of these social preferences remains largely unknown.\nC_LIO_LIIn this study, we use a network approach to examine the influence of kinship on social associations and interactions in wild, communally roosting sulphur-crested cockatoos, Cacatua galerita. We recorded roost co-membership, social associations and interactions in 561 individually marked birds across three neighbouring roosts. We then collected genetic samples from 205 cockatoos, and conducted a relationship analysis to construct a kinship network. Finally, we tested correlations between kinship and four social networks: association, affiliative, low-intensity aggression, and high-intensity aggression.\nC_LIO_LIOur result showed that while roosting groups were clearly defined, they showed little genetic differentiation or kin structuring. Between roost movement was high, with juveniles, especially females, repeatedly moving between roosts. Both within roosting communities, and when visiting different roosts, individuals preferentially associated with kin. Supporting this, individuals were also more likely to allopreen kin. However, contrary to expectation, individuals preferred to direct aggression towards kin, with this effect only observed when individuals shared roost membership.\nC_LIO_LIBy measuring social networks within and between large roosting groups, we could remove potential effects of passive spatial overlap on kin structuring. Our study reveals that sulphur-crested cockatoos actively prefer to associate with kin, both within and between roosting groups. By examining this across different interaction types, we further demonstrate that sulphur-crested cockatoos exhibit behavioural and context-dependent interaction rules towards kin. Our results help reveal the drivers of social association in this species, while adding to the evidence for social complexity in parrots.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke, the second leading cause of death worldwide, results from occlusion of a cerebral artery by a blood clot. Application of cyclic aspiration using an aspiration catheter is a current therapy for the removal of lodged clots. In this study, we perform finite element simulations to analyze deformation of long clots, having length to radius ratio of 2 to 10, which corresponds to clot-length of 2.85-14.25 mm, under peak-to-peak cyclic aspiration pressures of 10 to 50mmmHg, and frequencies of 0.5, 1 and 2 Hz. Our computational system comprises of a nonlinear viscoelastic solid clot, a hyperelastic artery, and a nonlinear viscoelastic cohesive zone, the latter modeling the clot-artery interface. We observe that clots having length-to-radius ratio approximately greater than two separate from the inner arterial surface somewhere between the axial and distal ends, irrespective of the cyclic aspiration loading conditions. The stress distribution within the clot shows large tensile stresses in the clot interior, indicating the possibility of simultaneous fragmentation of the clot. Thus, this study shows us the various failure mechanisms simultaneously present in the clot during cyclic aspiration. Similarly, the stress distribution within the artery implies a possibility of endothelial damage to the arterial wall near the end where the aspiration pressure is applied.

    "abstract": "MotivationHigh-dimension cytometry assays can simultaneously measure dozens of markers, enabling the investigation of complex phenotypes. However, as manual gating relies on previous biological knowledge, few marker combinations are often assessed. This results in complex phenotypes with potential for biological relevance being overlooked. Here we present PhenoComb, an R package that allows agnostic exploration of phenotypes by assessing all combinations of markers.\n\nDesignPhenoComb uses signal intensity thresholds to assign markers to discrete states (e.g. negative, low, high) and then counts the number of cells per sample from all possible marker combinations in a memory-safe manner. Time and disk space are the only constraints on the number of markers evaluated. PhenoComb also provides several approaches to perform statistical comparisons, evaluate the relevance of phenotypes, and assess the independence of identified phenotypes. PhenoComb allows users to guide analysis by adjusting several function arguments such as identifying parent populations of interest, filtering of low-frequency populations, and defining a maximum complexity of phenotypes to evaluate. We have designed PhenoComb to be compatible with local computer or server-based use.\n\nResultsIn testing of PhenoCombs performance on synthetic datasets, computation on 16 markers was completed in the scale of minutes and up to 26 markers in hours. We applied PhenoComb to two publicly available datasets: an HIV flow cytometry dataset (12 markers and 421 samples) and the COVIDome CyTOF dataset (40 markers and 99 samples). In the HIV dataset, PhenoComb identified immune phenotypes associated with HIV seroconversion, including those highlighted in the original publication. In the COVID dataset, we identified several immune phenotypes with altered frequencies in infected individuals relative to healthy individuals. Collectively, PhenoComb represents a powerful discovery tool for agnostically assessing high-dimension, single-cell data.\n\nAvailabilityThe PhenoComb R package can be downloaded from https://github.com/SciOmicsLab/PhenoComb",

While many in silico predictors have already been developed, their performance varies for different genes and diseases.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe evaluate 31 in silico predictors using a dataset of 1627 variants in HBA1, HBA2, and HBB. Through varying the decision threshold for each tool, we analyse their performance (a) as binary classifiers of pathogenicity, and (b) using different nonoverlapping pathogenic and benign thresholds for their optimal use in the ACMG/AMP framework.\n\nResultsCADD, Eigen-PC, and REVEL are the overall top performers, with the former reaching moderate strength level for pathogenic prediction. Eigen-PC and REVEL achieve the highest accuracies for missense variants, while CADD is also a reliable predictor of nonmissense variants. Moreover, SpliceAl is the top performing splicing predictor, reaching strong level of evidence, while GERP++ and phyloP are the most accurate conservation tools.\n\nDiscussionThis study provides evidence about the optimal use of computational evidence in globin gene clusters under the ACMG/AMP framework.",

The typical antidepressant fluoxetine is known to induce plasticity in the adult rodent visual cortex, as assessed by a shift in ocular dominance, a classical model of brain plasticity, and a similar effect has been described for ketamine and its metabolite 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (R,R-HNK). Here, we demonstrate that ketamine (at 3 or 20 mg/kg) and R,R-HNK facilitated the shift in ocular dominance in monocularly deprived mice, after 3 injections, throughout the 8-days regimen. Notably, the comparison between the treatments indicates a higher effect size of R,R-HNK compared to ketamine. Treatment with ketamine or R,R-HNK failed to influence the levels of perineuronal nets (PNNs) surrounding parvalbumin-positive interneurons. However, we observed in vitro that both ketamine and R,R-HNK are able to disrupt the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) interaction with the protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP{sigma}), which upon binding to PNNs dephosphorylates TRKB. These results support a model where diverse drugs promote the reinstatement of juvenile-like plasticity by directly binding TRKB and releasing it from PTP{sigma} regulation, without necessarily affecting PNNs deposits.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1A elicitics cardioprotection from ischemia and reperfusion injury. Here, we investigated tissue-specific pathways that are critical for HIF1A-elicited tissue protection. Initial studies showed that mice with induced global deletion of Hif1a (Hif1aloxP/loxP UbiquitinCre+) have exaggerated myocardial injury during in situ ischemia and reperfusion. Surprisingly, this phenotype was mirrored only in mice with myeloid-specific Hif1a deletion (Hif1aloxP/loxP LysM Cre+). In contrast, mice with myocardial specific (Hif1aloxP/loxP Myosin Cre+), or vascular Hif1a deletion (Hif1aloxP/loxP VEcadherin Cre+) experienced similar injury levels as controls. Subsequent studies using adoptive transfer of Hif1a-deficient polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) prior to myocardial injury demonstrated increased reperfusion injury. In contrast, adoptive transfer of PMNS treated ex-vivo with the HIF stabilizer dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) was associated with attenuated myocardial injury. Moreover, cardioprotection mediated by DMOG was abolished in Hif1aloxP/loxP LysM Cre+ mice, but not in Hif2aloxP/loxP LysM Cre+ mice. Finally, studies of PMN-dependent HIF1A target genes implicated the neuronal guidance molecule netrin-1 in mediating the cardioprotective effects of myeloid HIF1A. Taken together, the present studies identified a functional role for myeloid-expressed HIF1A in providing cardio-protection during ischemia and reperfusion injury, which - at least in part - is mediated by the induction of neuronal guidance molecule netrin-1 in neutrophils.",

ATX/LPA promote several (patho)physiological processes, including in pulmonary fibrosis, thus serving as attractive drug targets. However, it remains unclear if clinical outcome depends on how different ATX inhibitors modulate the ATX/LPA signaling axis. Here, we show that inhibitors binding to the ATX \"tunnel\" specifically abrogate key aspects of ATX/LPA signaling. We find that the tunnel is essential for signaling efficacy and dictates cellular responses independent of ATX catalytic activity, with a preference for activation of P2Y LPA receptors. These responses are abrogated by tunnel-binding inhibitors, such as ziritaxestat, but not by inhibitors that exclusively target the active site, as shown in primary lung fibroblasts and a murine model of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our results uncover a receptor-selective signaling mechanism for ATX, implying clinical benefit for tunnel-targeting ATX inhibitors.\n\nHighlightsATX is a dual-function protein acting as an LPA-producing enzyme and LPA chaperone.\n\nStructural integrity of the ATX tunnel is essential to mediate signaling functions.\n\nATX-bound LPA signals preferentially via P2Y family LPA receptors.\n\nOccupancy of the ATX tunnel is crucial for ziritaxestat to exert inhibition in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary transition of vertebrates from water to land during the Devonian period was accompanied by major changes in animal respiratory systems in terms of physiology and morphology. Indeed, the fossil record of the early tetrapods has revealed the existence of internal gills, which are vestigial fish-like traits used underwater. However, the fossil record provides only limited data on the process of the evolutionary transition of gills from fish to early tetrapods. This study investigated the gills of Polypterus senegalus, a basal ray-finned/amphibious fish which shows many ancestral features of stem Osteichthyes. Based on scanning electron microscopy observations and transcriptome analysis, the existence of motile cilia in the gills was revealed which may create a flow on the gill surface leading to efficient ventilation or remove particles from the surface. Interestingly, these cilia were observed to disappear after rearing in terrestrial or high CO2 environments, which mimics the environmental changes in the Devonian period. The cilia re-appeared after being returned to the original aquatic environment. The ability of plastic changes of gills in Polypterus revealed in this study may allow them to survive in fluctuating environments, such as shallow swamps. The ancestor of Osteichthyes is expected to have possessed such plasticity in the gills, which may be one of the driving forces behind the transition of vertebrates from water to land.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes the mono-, di, and trimethylation of histone protein H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27), which is strongly associated with transcriptionally silent chromatin. The functional core of PRC2 is highly conserved in animals and consists of four subunits. One of these, SUZ12, has not been identified in the genetic model Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas C. elegans PRC2 contains the clade-specific MES-3 protein. Through unbiased sensitive sequence similarity searches complemented by high-quality structure predictions of monomers and multimers, we here demonstrate that MES-3 is a highly divergent ortholog of SUZ12. MES-3 shares protein folds and conserved residues of key domains with SUZ12 and is predicted to interact with core PRC2 members similar to SUZ12 in human PRC2. Thus, in agreement with previous genetic and biochemical studies, we provide evidence that C. elegans contains a diverged yet evolutionary conserved core PRC2, like other animals.",

    "abstract": "The bacteriophage {lambda} red recombination system catalyzes the single-strand annealing homologous DNA recombination reaction, in which Red{beta} annealase protein plays a critical role. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we were able to determine a structure of a C-terminally truncated Red{beta} with the residues 1-177 bound to two complementary 27mer oligonucleotides forming an annealing intermediate, to a final resolution of 3.3 [A]. This structure validates and rationalizes decades of experimental observations on the biochemistry of Red{beta}. Definition of the interaction surfaces between subunits explains not only the DNA binding properties of Red{beta}, but also its propensity to oligomerize into long helical filaments, which are also formed by almost all annealases and are known to be functionally important. In addition, this annealing intermediate structure provides a detailed picture of the hydrogen bonding network that positions the DNA strands in a planar orientation to facilitate base pairing. Residues 133-138, which are missing from our structure, form a flexible loop. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to model the range of motion of the flexible loop, which suggested that it has a crucial role in keeping the DNA strands in the DNA-binding groove long enough to allow homology searching. The combination of structural and computational observations has allowed us to propose a detailed mechanism for the action of Red{beta}. More than half a century after its discovery, our work shines a light not only on the structure and mechanisms of Red{beta}, but also of other proteins within the annealase superfamilies.\n\nSignificance StatementSingle-strand annealing homologous DNA recombination is a process that is conserved throughout evolution from bacteriophages to humans, highlighting its importance and indispensability. It is a process that repairs double-stranded DNA breaks and is particularly vital in dsDNA viruses. The Red{beta} protein from the bacteriophage lambda is the archetypal annealase protein, forming the basis of our knowledge about this class of proteins. Along with the exonuclease {lambda}Exo, these two proteins not only form the model system for single-strand annealing homologous recombination, but are also used in thousands of laboratories worldwide for performing genetic manipulations. After its discovery in 1966, we report the first structure of the DNA-binding and oligomerization domain of Red{beta}, providing details about the mechanism of homologous DNA annealing.",

    "abstract": "The bottleneck in drug discovery for central nervous system diseases is the absence of effective systemic drug delivery technology for delivering therapeutic drugs into the brain. Although some Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) serotype can cross blood brain barrier and deliver virus genome packaged therapeutic DNA (gene) or RNA molecules to brain cells along with other organs, several hurdles have emerged in the AAV9 vector gene transfer technology in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. In order to overcome some of the hurdles, we have developed a workflow to generate a novel brain targeted drug delivery system (DDS) that involves generation of genetically engineering exosomes by first selecting various functional AAV capsid specific peptides (collectively called CAP) known to be involved in brain targeted high expression gene delivery, and then expressing the CAP in frame with lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (Lamp2b) followed by expressing CAP-Lamp2b fusion protein on the surface of mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes, generating CAP-exosomes. Intravenous injection of green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene loaded CAP-exosomes in mice transfer GFP gene throughout the CNS as measured by monitoring brain sections for GFP expression with confocal microscopy. GFP gene transfer efficiency is at least 20-fold greater than that of control Lamp2b-exosomes. GFP gene transduction to mouse liver was low. CAP-exosome has advantage over AAV-vector including, 1) no restriction in gene size to be delivered, 2) expected reduced production of neutralizing antibody, and 3) can be used separately for drug repurposing and/or in combination with therapeutic genes.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487362v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f70823org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@376183org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e30fc8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@21167c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
