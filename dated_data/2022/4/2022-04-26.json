    "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) can prevent and treat infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, continuously emerging variants, such as Omicron, have significantly reduced the potency of most known NAbs. The selection of NAbs with broad neutralizing activities and the identification of conserved critical epitopes are still urgently needed. Here, we identified an extremely potent antibody (55A8) by single B-cell sorting from convalescent SARS-CoV-2-infected patients that recognized the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. 55A8 could bind to wild-type SARS-CoV-2, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 simultaneously with 58G6, a NAb previously identified by our group. Importantly, an antibody cocktail containing 55A8 and 58G6 (2-cocktail) showed synergetic neutralizing activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the picomolar range in vitro and prophylactic efficacy in hamsters challenged with Omicron (BA.1) through intranasal delivery at an extraordinarily low dosage (25 g of each antibody daily) at 3 days post-infection. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that 55A8 is a Class III NAb that recognizes a highly conserved epitope. It could block angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding to the RBD in the S protein trimer via steric hindrance. The epitopes in the RBD recognized by 55A8 and 58G6 were found to be different and complementary, which could explain the synergetic mechanism of these two NAbs. Our findings not only provide a potential antibody cocktail for clinical use against infection with current SARS-CoV-2 strains and future variants but also identify critical epitope information for the development of better antiviral agents.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of late-onset Parkinsons disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), whose kinase activity is regulated by Rab29, a membrane-anchored GTPase. However, molecular mechanisms underlying Rab29-dependent recruitment and activation of LRRK2 remain unclear. Here we report cryo-EM structures of LRRK2-Rab29 complexes in three oligomeric states, illustrating snapshots of key steps during LRRK2 membrane recruitment and activation. Rab29 binds to the ARM domain of LRRK2, and disruption at the interface abrogates LRRK2 kinase activity. Activation of LRRK2 is underpinned by the formation of an unexpected Rab29-induced super-assembly containing two central kinase-active and two peripheral kinase-inactive LRRK2 protomers. Central protomers undergo pronounced oligomerization-associated rearrangements and adopt an active conformation. Our work reveals the structural mechanism for LRRK2s spatial regulation controlled by Rab GTPases, provides mechanistic insights into pathogenic mutations and identifies new opportunities to design LRRK2 inhibitors for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "We discovered an enhanced functionality hammerhead ribozyme (EhhRz), designed to act in trans against human rod opsin (RHO) mRNA, with turnover activity >300 nM min-1 under substrate-excess conditions and physiological Mg2+ levels (1 mM). We developed a real-time moderate-throughput fluorescence quantitative hhRz kinetic assay, which is linear with substrate and product moles and supported by gel-based measures. The EhhRz targets a CUC{downarrow} cleavage site in a substrate with no predicted secondary/tertiary structure and demonstrates classic Michaelis-Menten turnover behavior when the substrate is in 10-fold excess (Vmax/Km up to 1.60 x 108 min-1 M-1), which is comparable to RNase A. EhhRzs show cooperative titration with a Kd of 0.73 {+/-} 0.02 mM at cellular Mg2+ concentrations and a Hill coefficient of 1.73 {+/-} 0.07. The upstream EhhRz antisense flank (bound to a downstream substrate flank) interacts with stem-loop II, and examinations of different variants revealed that a U7 residue in the downstream flank of the substrate is not essential for enhanced activity. Under single-turnover conditions with substrate pre-annealed to enzyme, reaction rates exceeded 1,000 min-1. These findings show that RNA catalysis approaches the efficiency of the ribosome and suggests EhhRz in trans is a druggable nucleic acid therapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Gut-liver axis is the interaction between the gut, its microbiome and the liver. The crosstalk and interaction between these organs plays an important role in their individual health and disease. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a case in point where dysfunction of intestine actively promotes liver damage by alcohol. A flashpoint in ALD is the breach of intestinal integrity caused by gut bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (E.Faecalis). More specifically, Cytolysin, a toxin secreted by this bacteria may have a central role in the genesis of ALD. 3-D bioprinted human simulations of the gut-liver axis may help better understand the genesis of ALD.\n\nHere we developed a 3 dimensional bioprinted in vitro model composed of human origin intestinal and liver cells to explore the role of Cytolysin and ethanol in intestinal and liver damage. We find that neither Cytolysin or ethanol are sufficient for cell damage but a combination of the two act in concert to cause maximum breach in intestinal integrity. Secondly we find that enhanced transport of macromolecules thru the intestinal layer is not caused by overt cell toxicity but occurs through potentially paracellular/transcellular pathways. Our model will be used to test repurposed and new drugs/ biologics for treatment of ALD as well as other intestinal inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIsolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) is associated with increased BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) inflammation and lung allograft injury in lung transplant recipients (LTR). However, the effect of PsA on macrophage responses in this population is incompletely understood. We examined human alveolar macrophage (AM) responses to PsA and Pseudomonas dominant microbiome in healthy lung transplant recipients (LTR).\n\nMethodsWe stimulated THP-1 derived macrophages (THP-1M) and human AM from LTR with different bacteria and LTR BAL derived microbiome characterized as Pseudomonas-dominant. Macrophage responses were assessed by high dimensional flow cytometry, including their intracellular production of cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{beta}, IL-10, IL-1RA, and TGF-{beta}). Pharmacological inhibitors were utilized to evaluate the role of the inflammasome in PsA-macrophages interaction.\n\nResultsWe observed upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{beta}) following stimulation by PsA compared to other bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus pneumoniae) in both THP-1 derived and LTR AM, predominated by IL-1{beta}. IL-1{beta} production from THP-1 was sustained after PsA stimulation for up to 96 hours and 48 hours in LTR AM. Treatment with the inflammasome inhibitor BAY11-7082 abrogated macrophage IL-1{beta} and IL-18 production after PsA exposure. BAL Pseudomonas-dominant microbiota elicited an increased IL-1{beta}, similar to PsA, an effect abrogated by the addition of antibiotics.\n\nConclusionPsA and PsA-dominant lung microbiota induce sustained IL-1{beta} production in LTR AM. Pharmacological targeting of the inflammasome reduces PsA-macrophage-IL1{beta} responses, underscoring their use in lung transplant recipients.",

In this study, we investigated C1q binding and subsequent complement activation by anti-spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific antibodies produced following vaccination with either the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 or the inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV.\n\nMethodsSerum samples were collected in the period July 2021-March 2022. Participants demographic data, type of vaccine, date of vaccination, as well as adverse effects of the vaccine were recorded. The serum samples were incubated with S protein RBD-coated plates. Levels of human IgG, IgM, and C1q, that were bound to the plate, as well as formed C5b-9, were compared between different groups of participants.\n\nResultsA total of 151 samples were collected from vaccinated (n=116) and non-vaccinated (n=35) participants. Participants who received either one or two doses of BNT162b2 formed higher levels of anti-RBD IgG than participants who received BBIBP-CorV. The anti-RBD IgG formed following either vaccine bound C1q, but significantly more C1q binding was observed in participants who received BNT162b2. Subsequently, C5b-9 formation was significantly higher in participants who received BNT162b2, while no significant difference in C5b-9 formation was found between the non-vaccinated and BBIBP-CorV groups. Formation of C5b-9 was strongly correlated to C1q binding, additionally, the ratio of formed C5b-9/ bound C1q was significantly higher in the BNT162b2 group.\n\nConclusionAnti-RBD IgG formed following vaccination can bind C1q with subsequent complement activation, the degree of terminal complement pathway activation differed between vaccines, which could play a role in in the protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines. Further investigation into the correlation between vaccine protection and the ability of vaccine generated antibodies to activate complement is required.",

    "abstract": "The dimorphic fungus Candida albicans is the one of the most important opportunistic pathogen of human. The use of fungicides against candida encounters sub-inhibitory effects, which are fungal stress response and undesirable for the host. In this work we investigated antifungal action of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 with focus on they biofilm forming ability under the treatment.\n\nIt was found that 2,4-DAPG reduced ability of candida cells to form biofilm, but complete inhibition or irradiation did not achieve. Moreover, Candida albicans cells in the adherent state have been characterized by reduced susceptibility to 2,4-DAPG comparing to planktonic cells.\n\nInvestigation of mechanisms which could be explain the antibiofilm action of 2,4-DAPG has revealed the reduction in cells surface hydrophobicity and inhibition of yeast-to-hyphae transition. Biofilms formed under the sub-inhibitory concentrations of 2,4-DAPG were depleted in protein and carbohydrate content. Furthermore, we microscopically visualized the treated biofilms and have revealed numerous cannels localized on hyphae and associated with secretion of aspartyl proteases (Sap).\n\nWe assumed what excretion of Sap is triggered by reactive oxygen generated upon affecting of mitochondrion respiration by 2,4-DAPG. Introducing of antioxidant Trolox simultaneously with 2,4-DAPG lead to reducing of Sap production. Thus, production of aspartyl proteases is a one of undesirable side effect of Candida albicans treatment, but using 2,4-DAPG in combination with antioxidants is the solution to overcome it.",

    "abstract": "Although picornaviruses are conventionally considered  nonenveloped, members of multiple picornaviral genera are released nonlytically from infected cells in extracellular vesicles. The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.\n\nAuthors SummaryMechanisms underlying nonlytic release of canonical nonenveloped viruses from infected cells are poorly understood. We show here that release of hepatitis A virus from cells in exosome-like vesicles requires nonredundant activities of two distinct Bro1-domain proteins associated with host cell machinery (ESCRT) for endosomal sorting, HD-PTP and ALIX. We demonstrate both Bro1 domain proteins are recruited to the viral capsid by the pX segment of the 1D capsid protein, and that they act in a non-redundant manner to mediate virus release. Fusing pX to a self-assembling nanocage protein resulted in ESCRT-dependent release mediated by a short pX peptide sequence conserved in hepatoviruses from bats to humans. Mutations within the pX sequence ablate release and result in noncytolytic virus accumulating intracellularly. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows nonlytic release of quasi-enveloped virus is an ancient evolutionary trait of hepatoviruses.",

To identify genomic features and biochemical pathways of rhizobia that could foster improved symbiotic function under low temperatures, we isolated and characterized three Mesorhizobium strains from legume nodules collected at two distant northern Canadian sites. Whereas the classical determinants of nodulation and nitrogen fixation are located on the chromosome of most mesorhizobia, whole genome sequencing revealed that these genes are on a large symbiotic megaplasmid in all three of the newly isolated strains. A pangenome-wide association study identified 25 genes putatively associated with mesorhizobia isolated from arctic or subarctic environments, with the genomic location of many of these genes implying a relationship with legume symbiosis. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses of the common nodulation genes revealed alleles that are highly conserved amongst mesorhizobia isolated from northern climates but uncommon in mesorhizobia isolated from similar plant hosts in other climatic regions, suggesting potential functional adaptive differences and the horizontal transfer of these alleles between northern rhizobia. We speculate that nod sequence divergence was driven by climatic factors, and that the encoded proteins may be particularly stable and/or active at low temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The concept of a nucleic acid barcode applied to pathogen genomes is easy to grasp and the many possible uses are straightforward. But implementation may not be easy, especially when growing through multiple generations or assaying the pathogen long-term. The potential problems include: the barcode might alter fitness, the barcode may accumulate mutations, and construction of the marked pathogens may result in unintended barcodes that are not as designed. Here, we generate approximately 5000 randomized barcodes in the genome of the prototypic small DNA virus murine polyomavirus. We describe the challenges faced with interpreting the barcode sequences obtained from the library. Our Illumina NextSeq sequencing recalled much greater variation in barcode sequencing reads than the expected 5000 barcodes - necessarily stemming from the Illumina library processing and sequencing error. Using data from defined control virus genomes cloned into plasmid backbones we develop a vetted post-sequencing method to cluster the erroneous reads around the true virus genome barcodes. These findings may foreshadow problems with randomized barcodes in other microbial systems and provide a useful approach for future work utilizing nucleic acid barcoded pathogens.",

Culture media of Aspergillus fumigatus Af293, Aspergillus tubingensis CBS 133792 and the non-acidifying mutant strain Aspergillus niger D15#26 contained components that showed competition for binding to a total of 13 receptors, of which PSGL-1, CXCR1, and CXCR2, were shared between the three species. Filtration experiments showed that most, if not all, interacting components were [&le;] 3 kDa. Production of the components that competed with antibodies to bind to CD88 and CXCR2 was shown to be regulated by LaeA.

    "abstract": "Public health emergencies like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have prioritized surveillance of zoonotic coronaviruses, resulting in extensive genomic characterization of coronavirus diversity in bats. Sequencing viral genomes directly from animal specimens remains a laboratory challenge, however, and most bat coronaviruses have been characterized solely by PCR amplification of small regions from the best-conserved gene. This has resulted in limited phylogenetic resolution and left viral genetic factors relevant to threat assessment undescribed.\n\nIn this study, we evaluated whether a technique called hybridization probe capture can achieve more extensive genome recovery from surveillance specimens. Using a custom panel of 20,000 probes, we captured and sequenced coronavirus genomic material in 21 swab specimens collected from bats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For 15 of these specimens, probe capture recovered more genome sequence than had been previously generated with standard amplicon sequencing protocols, providing a median 6.1-fold improvement (ranging up to 69.1-fold). Probe capture data also identified five novel alpha- and betacoronaviruses in these specimens, and their full genomes were recovered with additional deep sequencing. Based on these experiences, we discuss how probe capture could be effectively operationalized alongside other sequencing technologies for high-throughput, genomics-based discovery and surveillance of bat coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Conflicts between transcription and cohesin-mediated loop extrusion can majorly influence 3D chromatin architecture but whether these structural changes affect biological function is unknown. Here, we show that a critical step in antibody class switch recombination (CSR) in activated B cells, namely, the juxtaposition (synapsis) of donor and acceptor switch (S) recombination sequences at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (Igh), occurs at the interface of a de novo topologically associating domain (TAD) boundary formed via transcriptional activity at acceptor S regions. Using Tri-C to capture higher-order multiway chromatin conformations, we find that synapsis occurs predominantly in the proximity of distal 3 CTCF-binding sites and that this multiway conformation is abolished upon downregulation of transcription and loss of the TAD boundary at the acceptor S region. Thus, an insulating de novo TAD boundary created by the conflict between transcription and loop extrusion plays a direct role in the mechanism of CSR.",

    "abstract": "The human Na+/H+ antiporter NHA2 (SLC9B2) transports Na+ or Li+ across the plasma membrane in exchange for protons, and is implicated in various pathologies. It is a 537 amino acids protein with an 82 residues long hydrophilic cytoplasmic N-terminus followed by a transmembrane part comprising 14 transmembrane helices. We optimized the functional expression of HsNHA2 in the plasma membrane of a salt-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain and characterized a set of mutated or truncated versions of HsNHA2 in terms of their substrate specificity, transport activity, localization and protein stability. We identified a highly conserved proline 246, located in the core of the protein, as being crucial for ion selectivity. The replacement of P246 with serine or threonine resulted in antiporters with altered substrate specificity and increased resistance to the HsNHA2-specific inhibitor phloretin that were not only highly active at an acidic pH of 4.0 (like the native antiporter), but also at neutral pH. We also experimentally confirmed the importance of a putative salt bridge between E215 and R432 for antiporter function and structural integrity. Truncations of the first 50 - 70 residues of the N-terminus doubled the transport activity of HsNHA2, whilst changes in the charge at positions E47, E56, K57, or K58 decreased the antiporters transport activity. Thus, the hydrophilic N-terminal part of the protein appears to allosterically autoinhibit its cation transport. Our data also show this in vivo approach to be useful for a rapid screening of SNPs effect on HsNHA2 activity.",

    "abstract": "Hox genes encode transcription factors that specify segmental identities along the Antero-Posterior body axis. These genes are organized in clusters, where their order corresponds to their activity along the body axis, an evolutionary conserved feature known as collinearity. In Drosophila, the BX-C cluster contains the three most posterior Hox genes, where their collinear activation incorporates progressive replacement of histone modifications, reorganization of 3D chromatin architecture and sequential activation of boundary elements and cis-regulatory regions. To dissect functional hierarchies, we compared chromatin organization in larvae and in cell lines, with a focus on the Abd-B gene. Our work establishes the importance of the Fab-7 boundary element for insulation between 3D domains marked by different histone modifications. Interestingly, we detected a non-canonical inversion of collinear chromatin dynamics at the Abd-B gene, with the active histone domain decreasing in size. This chromatin organization differentially instructed alternative Abd-B promoter use, thereby expanding the possibilities to regulate transcriptional output.",

    "abstract": "Host genetics can shape microbiome composition, but to what extent it does, remains unclear. Like any other complex trait, this question can be addressed by estimating the heritability (h2) of the microbiome - the proportion of variance in the abundance of each taxon that is attributable to host genetic variation. However, unlike most complex traits, microbiome heritability is typically based on relative abundance data, where taxon-specific abundances are expressed as the proportion of the total microbial abundance in a sample. We derived an analytical approximation for the heritability that one obtains when using such relative abundances and we uncovered three problems: 1) The interdependency between taxa leads to imprecise heritability estimates. 2) Large sample size leads to high false discovery rates, overestimating the number of heritable taxa. 3) Microbial co-abundances lead to biased heritability estimates. We conclude that caution must be taken when interpreting heritability estimates and comparing values across studies.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is widely recognized as a serious global public health problem. To combat this threat, a thorough understanding of bacterial genomes is necessary. The current wide availability of bacterial genomes provides us with an in-depth understanding of the great variability of dispensable genes and their relationship with antimicrobials. Some of these accessory genes are those involved in CRISPR-Cas systems, which are acquired immunity systems that are present in part of bacterial genomes. They prevent viral infections through small DNA fragments called spacers. But the vast majority of these spacers have not yet been associated with the virus they recognize, and this has been named CRISPR dark matter. By analyzing the spacers of tens of thousands of genomes from six bacterial species highly resistant to antibiotics, we have been able to reduce the CRISPR dark matter from 80-90% to as low as 15% in some of the species. In addition, we have observed that, when a genome presents CRISPR-Cas systems, this is accompanied by particular collections of membrane proteins. Our results suggest that when a bacterium presents membrane proteins that make it compete better in its environment, and these proteins are in turn receptors for specific phages, it would be forced to acquire CRISPR-Cas immunity systems to avoid infection by these phages.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring activating mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are sensitive to therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Despite remarkable clinical responses using EGFR TKI, surviving drug tolerant cells serve as a reservoir from which drug resistant tumors may emerge. This study addresses the need for improved efficacy of EGFR TKI by identifying targets involved in functional drug tolerance against them. To this aim, a high-throughput siRNA kinome screen was performed using two EGFR TKI-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines in the presence/absence of the second-generation EGFR TKI afatinib. From the screen, Serine/Threonine/Tyrosine Kinase 1 (STYK1) was identified as a target that when downregulated potentiates the effects of EGFR inhibition in vitro. We found that chemical inhibition of EGFR combined with the siRNA-mediated knockdown of STYK1 led to a significant decrease in cancer cell viability and anchorage-independent cell growth. Further, we show that STYK1 selectively interacts with mutant EGFR and that the interaction is disrupted upon EGFR inhibition. Finally, we identified fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) as a downstream effector of STYK1 in NSCLC cells. Accordingly, downregulation of STYK1 counteracted the afatinib-induced upregulation of FGF1. Altogether, we unveil STYK1 as a valuable target to repress the pool of surviving drug tolerant cells arising upon EGFR inhibition. Co-targeting of EGFR and STYK1 could lead to a better overall outcome for NSCLC patients.",

However, the response rate to immune checkpoint blockade is only 13% for recurrent HNSCC, highlighting the urgent need to better understand tumor-immune interplay, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes.

CSC exhibit singular properties that enable them to avoid immune detection and eradication. The immune cell types that directly engage with CSC to allow immune escape and cancer recurrence are still unknown. Here, we genetically engineered CSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to perform sortase-mediated in vivo proximity labeling. We identified specific immune cell subsets recruited into the CSC niche. We demonstrated that unmanipulated CSC-EVs preferentially target MHC-II- macrophages and PD1+ T cells, and that such EV-mediated intercellular communication between CSC and these immune cells contributed to the observed spatial interactions and niche sharing. These results suggest that combination therapies targeting CSC, tumor macrophages and PD1 may synergize and lower local recurrence rates in HNSCC patients.",

    "abstract": "Light signals perceived by a group of photoreceptors have profound effects on the physiology, growth, and development of plants. The red/far-red light absorbing phytochromes modulate these aspects by intricately regulating gene expression at multiple levels. Previously, we reported that two splicing factors SFPS (SPLICING FACTOR FOR PHYTOCHROME SIGNALING) and RRC1 (REDUCED RED LIGHT RESPONSES IN CRY1CRY2 BACKGROUND 1), interact with photoactivated phyB to regulate light-mediated pre-mRNA alternative splicing (AS). Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of an RNA binding splicing factor, SWAP1 (SUPPRESSOR-OF-WHITE-APRICOT/SURP RNA-BINDING DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN1). Loss-of-function swap1-1 mutant is hyposensitive to red light and exhibits a day light-independent early flowering phenotype. SWAP1 physically interacts with both SFPS and RRC1 in a light-independent manner and forms a ternary complex. In addition, SWAP1 also physically interacts with photoactivated phyB and colocalizes with nuclear phyB photobodies. Deep RNA-seq analyses show that SWAP1 regulates the gene expression and pre-mRNA alternative splicing of a large number of genes including those involved in plant responses to light signaling. A comparison with SFPS- and RRC1-regulated events shows that all three splicing factors coordinately regulate the alternative splicing of a subset of genes. Collectively, our study uncovered the function of a new splicing factor, which interacts with photoactivated phyB, in modulating light-regulated development in plants.\n\nSIGNIFICANCERegulation of transcription and pre-mRNA alternative splicing is essential for the transcript diversity and modulation of light signaling in plants. Although several transcription factors involved in light signaling have been discovered and characterized in-depth, only a few splicing factors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of light signaling pathways. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a new splicing factor SWAP1, which interact with two previously characterized splicing factors, SFPS and RRC1, forming a ternary complex. We show that, like SFPS and RRC1, SWAP1 also interacts with photoactivated phyB, and consistently, swap1 seedlings are hyposensitive to red light. SWAP1 modulates alternative splicing of a large number of genes and a subset of these genes are coordinately regulated by SFPS, RRC1 and SWAP1. These results highlight the importance of not only the transcription factors but also the phyB-interacting splicing factors in light-regulated plant development.",

    "abstract": "UFMylation mediates the covalent modification of substrate proteins with UFM1 (Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1) and regulates the selective degradation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via autophagy (ER-phagy) to maintain ER homeostasis. Specifically, collisions of the ER-bound ribosomes trigger ribosome UFMylation, which in turn activates C53-mediated autophagy that clears the toxic incomplete polypeptides. C53 has evolved non-canonical shuffled ATG8 interacting motifs (sAIMs) that are essential for ATG8 interaction and autophagy initiation. Why these non-canonical motifs were selected during evolution, instead of canonical ATG8 interacting motifs remains unknown. Here, using a phylogenomics approach, we show that UFMylation is conserved across the eukaryotes and secondarily lost in fungi and some other species. Further biochemical assays have confirmed those results and showed that the unicellular algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a functional UFMylation machinery, overturning the assumption that this process is linked to multicellularity. Our conservation analysis also revealed that UFM1 co-evolves with the sAIMs in C53, reflecting a functional link between UFM1 and the sAIMs. Using biochemical and structural approaches, we confirmed the interaction of UFM1 with the C53 sAIMs and found that UFM1 and ATG8 bound to the sAIMs in a different mode. Conversion of sAIMs into canonical AIMs prevented binding of UFM1 to C53, while strengthening ATG8 interaction. This led to the autoactivation of the C53 pathway and sensitized Arabidopsis thaliana to ER stress. Altogether, our findings reveal an ancestral toggle switch embodied in the sAIMs that regulates C53-mediated autophagy to maintain ER homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal migration is one of the fundamental processes during brain development. Several neurodevelopmental disorders can be traced back to dysregulated migration. Although substantial efforts have been placed in identifying molecular signals that stimulate migration, little is known about potential mechanisms that restrict migration. These restrictive mechanisms are essential for proper development since it helps coordinate the timing for each neuronal population to arrive and establish proper connections. Moreover, preventing migration away from a proliferative niche is necessary to maintain a pool of proliferating cells until the proper number of neuronal progenitors is attained.\n\nHere, we identify an anti-migratory role for the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in cerebellar development. Our results show that granule cell precursors robustly express p75NTR in the external granule layer (EGL) when they are proliferating during postnatal development, however, they do not express p75NTR when they migrate either from the rhombic lip during embryonic development or from the EGL during postnatal development. We show that p75NTR prevented GCP migration by maintaining elevated levels of active RhoA. The expression of p75NTR was sufficient to prevent the migration of the granule cells even in the presence of BDNF, a well-established chemotactic signal for this cell population. Our findings suggest that the expression of p75NTR might be a critical signal that stops and maintains the GCPs in the proliferative niche of the EGL, promoting the clonal expansion of cerebellar granule neurons.",

    "abstract": "Viruses depend on cellular metabolic resources to supply the energy and biomolecular building blocks necessary for their replication. Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a leading cause of birth defects and morbidity in immunosuppressed individuals, induces numerous metabolic activities that are important for productive infection. However, many of the mechanisms through which these metabolic activities are induced and how they contribute to infection are unclear. We find that HCMV infection of fibroblasts induces a neuronal gene signature, as well as the expression of several metabolic enzyme isoforms that are typically expressed in other tissue types. Of these, the most substantially induced gene was the neuron-specific isoform of enolase (ENO2). Induction of ENO2 expression is important for HCMV-mediated glycolytic activation, as well as for the virally-induced remodeling of pyrimidine-sugar metabolism, which provides the glycosyl subunits necessary for protein glycosylation. Inhibition of ENO2 expression or activity reduced UDP-sugar pools, attenuated the accumulation of viral glycoproteins, and induced the accumulation of non-infectious viral particles. In addition, our data indicate that the induction of ENO2 expression depends on the HCMV UL38 protein. Collectively, our data indicate that HCMV infection induces a tissue atypical neuronal glycolytic enzyme to activate glycolysis and UDP-sugar metabolism to provide the glycosyl building blocks necessary for viral protein glycosylation and the production of infectious virions.\n\nSignificance StatementViruses are obligate parasites that obtain energy and mass from their host cell. Control over the metabolic resources of the cell has emerged as an important host-pathogen interaction that can determine infectious outcomes. We find that the Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a major cause of birth defects and morbidity in immunosuppressed patient populations, induces a neuronal gene signature in fibroblasts including the expression of neuronal-specific enolase (ENO2). Our data indicate that ENO2 is important for HCMV-mediated metabolic remodeling including glycolytic activation and the production of pyrimidine sugars, as well as for viral infectivity. These findings indicate that viruses are capable of tapping into alternative tissue-specific metabolic programs to support infection, highlighting an important viral mechanism of metabolic modulation.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe goal of this study was to test whether histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) restore somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) expression in models of high-grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), thereby facilitating effective treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy.\n\nMethodsTo assess tumor grade correlation with SSTR2 expression, we assessed human SSTR2 promoter methylation and expression levels in 96 NIH patient samples and merged the GSE149395 and GSE117852 datasets. We used three NET cell lines (QGP-1, BON-1, GOT-1) characterized by variable SSTR2 expression profiles for functional in vitro studies using HDACis. Finally, the QGP-1 xenograft mouse model, with low basal SSTR2 expression, was used to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of combined HDACi and 177Lu-DOTATATE therapies.\n\nResultsHuman PNET SSTR2 promoter methylation showed a significant positive correlation with higher tumor grades (P = 0.000014). We also found a significant negative correlation (P < 0.0001) between SSTR2 promoter methylation and SSTR2 expression in three NET cell lines. In vitro, SSTR2 expression increased significantly in BON-1 and QGP-1 cells at 48 and 72 hours in a dose-dependent fashion using two different HDACis, valproic acid and CI-994. In vivo studies demonstrated a significant increase in 177Lu-DOTATATE tumor uptake in QGP-1-engrafted mice after 10 days of CI-994 pretreatment (P = 0.0175). Treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE reduced tumor size in mice pretreated with CI-994 compared to 177Lu-DOTATATE alone (at 15 days, P = 0.0028).\n\nConclusionHDACis increase SSTR2 surface expression in models of high-grade, SSTR2-deficient PNETs. This approach has the potential to improve tumor response to targeted therapy with 177 Lu-DOTATATE in patients with receptor-negative, metastatic PNETs.\n\nTranslational Relevance StatementPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) express high levels of somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), a unique target for both tumor imaging and therapy. Unfortunately, high-grade PNETs lose SSTR2 surface expression and thus become ineligible for SSTR2-targeted 177Lu-DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Restoring SSTR2 expression through the reversal of inhibitory epigenetic gene silencing mechanisms has the potential for improving tumor responsiveness to PRRT. We demonstrate that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) upregulate SSTR2 surface expression in three NET cell lines in vitro. In an in vivo PNET xenograft model with low basal SSTR2 expression, our studies validate a significantly higher tumor uptake of SSTR2-targeted 177Lu-DOTATATE in animals pretreated with HDACis compared to controls. Furthermore, we show that this higher tumor uptake results in significant anti-tumor response when compared to standard PRRT alone. Our preclinical results thus provide a rationale for utilizing HDACi pretreatment to improve targeted radionuclide therapy in patients with SSTR2-negative, metastatic PNETs.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome analysis is quickly moving towards high-throughput methods such as metagenomic sequencing. Accurate taxonomic classification of metagenomic data relies on reference sequence databases, and their associated taxonomy. However, for understudied environments such as the rumen microbiome many sequences will be derived from novel or uncultured microbes that are not present in reference databases. As a result, taxonomic classification of metagenomic data from understudied environments may be inaccurate. To assess the accuracy of taxonomic read classification, this study classified metagenomic data that had been simulated from cultured rumen microbial genomes from the Hungate collection. To assess the impact of reference databases on the accuracy of taxonomic classification, the data was classified with Kraken 2 using several reference databases. We found that the choice and composition of reference database significantly impacted on taxonomic classification results, and accuracy. In particular, NCBI RefSeq proved to be a poor choice of database. Our results indicate that inaccurate read classification is likely to be a significant problem, affecting all studies that use insufficient reference databases. We observe that adding cultured reference genomes from the rumen to the reference database greatly improves classification rate and accuracy. We also demonstrate that metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) have the potential to further enhance classification accuracy by representing uncultivated microbes, sequences of which would otherwise be unclassified or incorrectly classified. However, classification accuracy was strongly dependent on the taxonomic labels assigned to these MAGs. We therefore highlight the importance of accurate reference taxonomic information and suggest that, with formal taxonomic lineages, MAGs have the potential to improve classification rate and accuracy, particularly in environments such as the rumen that are understudied or contain many novel genomes.",

Here we investigated the predictions of this hypothesis using a range of published datasets. We failed to detect enrichment of cytosine modification at genomic CA repeat arrays in mouse brain regions and found no evidence for preferential MeCP2 binding at CA repeats. Moreover, we did not observe a correlation between the CA repeat density near genes and their degree of transcriptional deregulation when MeCP2 was absent. Our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that CA repeats are key mediators of MeCP2 function. Instead, we found that CA repeats are subject to CAC methylation to a degree that is typical of the surrounding genome and contribute modestly to MeCP2-mediated modulation of gene expression in accordance with their content of this canonical target motif.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are essential organelles that play a key role in cellular energy metabolism. Transitions between glycolytic and respiratory conditions induce considerable adaptations of the cellular proteome. These metabolism-dependent changes are particularly pronounced for the protein composition of mitochondria. Here we show that the yeast cytosolic ubiquitin conjugase Ubc8 plays a crucial role in the remodeling process when cells transition from respiratory to fermentative conditions. Ubc8 is a conserved and well-studied component of the catabolite control system that is known to regulate the stability of gluconeogenesis enzymes. Unexpectedly, we found that Ubc8 also promotes the assembly of the translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria (TOM) and stabilizes its cytosol-exposed receptor subunit Tom22. Ubc8 deficiency results in a compromised protein import into mitochondria and a subsequent accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol. Our observations show that Ubc8, which is controlled by the prevailing metabolic conditions, promotes the switch from glucose synthesis to glucose usage in the cytosol and induces the biogenesis of the mitochondrial TOM machinery in order to improve mitochondrial protein import during phases of metabolic transition.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is a cancer predisposition syndrome driven by mutation of the tumor suppressor fumarate hydratase (FH). Inactivation of FH causes accumulation of the electrophilic oncometabolite fumarate. In the absence of methods for reactivation, tumor suppressors can be targeted via identification of synthetic lethal interactions using genetic screens. Inspired by recent advances in chemoproteomic target identification, here we test the hypothesis that the electrophilicity of the HLRCC metabolome may produce unique susceptibilities to covalent small molecules, a phenomenon we term conditional covalent lethality. Screening a panel of chemically diverse electrophiles we identified a covalent ligand, MP-1, that exhibits FH-dependent cytotoxicity. Synthesis and structure-activity profiling identified key molecular determinants underlying the molecules effects. Chemoproteomic profiling of cysteine reactivity together with clickable probes validated the ability of MP-1 to engage an array of functional cysteines, including one lying in the Zn-finger domain of the tRNA methyltransferase enzyme TRMT1. TRMT1 overexpression rescues tRNA methylation from inhibition by MP-1 and partially attenuates the covalent ligands cytotoxicity. Our studies highlight the potential for covalent metabolites and small molecules to synergistically produce novel synthetic lethal interactions and raise the possibility of applying phenotypic screening with chemoproteomic target identification to identify new functional oncometabolite targets.",

    "abstract": "DNA cytosine methylation is an epigenetic modification that has a critical role in gene regulation and genome stability. DNA methylation can be detected and measured using sequencing instruments after sodium bisulfite conversion, but experiments can be expensive for large eukaryotic genomes. Sequencing non-uniformity and mapping biases can leave parts of the genome with low or no coverage, thus hampering the ability of obtaining DNA methylation levels for all cytosines. To address these limitations, several computational methods have been proposed that can predict DNA methylation from the DNA sequence around the cytosine, or from the methylation level of nearby cytosines. Most of these methods are, however, entirely focused on CG methylation in humans and other mammals. In this work, we study for the first time the problem of predicting cytosine methylation for CG, CHG, and CHH contexts on five plant species, either from the DNA primary sequence around the cytosine or the methylation levels of neighboring cytosines. In this framework, we also study (1) the cross-species prediction problem, i.e., the classification performance when training on one species and testing on another species, and the (2) the cross-context prediction problem, i.e., the classification performance when training on one context and testing on another context (within the same species). Finally, we show that providing the classifier with gene annotation information allows our classifier to outperform the prediction accuracy of state-of-the-art methods.",

Since mechanical strength of proteins is a critical determinant of its stabilization, TMAO might play a relevant role by favoring its folding dynamics or by enhancing its mechanical stability. To address this question, we have performed the single-molecule magnetic tweezers experiment to explore the TMAO effect on two structurally distinct substrates-protein L and talin. We observed that TMAO increases the mechanical stability of these proteins through increasing their unfolding force. Additionally, we are able to demonstrate that TMAO retards the unfolding kinetics, while accelerating the refolding kinetics under force; which eventually tilts the energy landscape towards the folded state. Interestingly, this TMAO-enhanced protein folding generates mechanical work output upto [~]67 zJ, allowing the protein folding under higher force regime. Overall this TMAO-enhanced mechanical stability provides a significant implication to folding-induced structural stability of proteins.",

    "abstract": "In Escherichia coli and Salmonella, many genes silenced by the nucleoid structuring protein H-NS are activated upon inhibiting Rho-dependent transcription termination. This response is poorly understood and difficult to reconcile with the view that H-NS acts mainly by blocking transcription initiation. Here we have analysed the basis for the upregulation of H-NS-silenced Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1) in cells depleted of Rho-cofactor NusG. Evidence from genetic experiments, semi-quantitative 5 RACE-Seq and ChiP-Seq shows that transcription originating from spurious antisense promoters, when not stopped by Rho, elongates into a H-NS-bound regulatory region of SPI-1, displacing H-NS and rendering the DNA accessible to the master regulator HilD. In turn, HilDs ability to activate its own transcription triggers a positive feedback loop that results in transcriptional activation of the entire SPI-1. Significantly, single-cell analyses revealed that this mechanism is largely responsible for the coexistence of two subpopulations of cells that, although genetically identical, either express or dont express SPI-1 genes. We propose that cell-to-cell differences produced by stochastic spurious transcription, combined with feedback loops that perpetuate the activated state, can generate bimodal gene expression patterns in bacterial populations.",

Transcriptional regulation in intracellular pathogens plays an important role in adapting to the challenging environment inside the host cells. Previously, we demonstrated that Rv1019, a putative transcriptional regulator of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, is an autorepressor. We showed that, Rv1019 is cotranscribed with Rv1020 (mfd) and Rv1021 (mazG) encoding DNA repair proteins and negatively regulates the expression of these genes. In the present study, we show that Rv1019 also regulates the expression of the genes Rv3230c and Rv3229c (desA3) which form a two-gene operon in M. tuberculosis. Constitutive expression of Rv1019 in M. tuberculosis significantly downregulated the expression of these genes. Employing Waynes hypoxia-induced dormancy model of M. tuberculosis, we show that Rv1019 is upregulated (3-fold) under hypoxia. Finally, by reporter assay, using M. smegmatis as a model, we validate that Rv1019 is recruited to the promoter of Rv3230c-Rv3229c during hypoxia and negatively regulates this operon which is involved in the biosynthesis of oleic acid.",

Chicago, Illinois and its suburbs have suffered high incidence of human West Nile virus infections in the past. This makes abatement programs in and around the Chicago area an essential service. The control of Cx. pipiens is often complicated by rapidly evolving resistance to pyrethroids, which are the most widely used chemical class in US mosquito abatement programs. The present study assessed Sumithrin(R) resistance in Cx. pipiens collected from five locations around Cook County, Illinois, neighboring the city limits of Chicago. According to CDC guidelines, samples from all five locations demonstrated some resistance to Sumithrin(R). When assessed with Anvil(R), a formulated product made of Sumithrin(R) synergized with piperonyl butoxide, susceptibility was rescued in mosquitoes from three out of the five locations, suggesting involvement of mixed-function oxidases and/or carboxylesterases in Sumithrin(R) resistance at these locations. Not all locations had susceptibility rescued by Anvil(R), but these locations had relatively low knockdown resistance allele frequencies, suggesting that mechanisms other than knockdown resistance may be involved. Enzyme activities did not reveal any marked trends that could be related back to mortality in the bottle bioassays, which highlights the need for multiple types of assays to infer enzymatic involvement in resistance. Future directions in pyrethroid resistance management in Chicago area Cx. pipiens are discussed.",
