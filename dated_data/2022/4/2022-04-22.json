    "abstract": "Accurately identifying cell populations is paramount to the quality of downstream analyses and overall interpretations of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets but remains a challenge. The quality of single-cell clustering depends on the proximity metric used to generate cell-to-cell distances. Accordingly, proximity metrics have been benchmarked for scRNA-seq clustering, typically with results averaged across datasets to identify a highest performing metric. However, the  best-performing metric varies between studies, with the performance differing significantly between datasets. This suggests that the unique structural properties of a scRNA-seq dataset, specific to the biological system under study, has a substantial impact on proximity metric performance. Previous benchmarking studies have omitted to factor the structural properties into their evaluations. To address this gap, we developed a framework for the in-depth evaluation of the performance of 17 proximity metrics with respect to core structural properties of scRNA-seq data, including sparsity, dimensionality, cell population distribution and rarity. We find that clustering performance can be improved substantially by the selection of an appropriate proximity metric and neighbourhood size for the structural properties of a dataset, in addition to performing suitable pre-processing and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, popular metrics such as Euclidean and Manhattan distance performed poorly in comparison to several lessor applied metrics, suggesting the default metric for many scRNA-seq methods should be re-evaluated. Our findings highlight the critical nature of tailoring scRNA-seq analyses pipelines to the system under study and provide practical guidance for researchers looking to optimise cell similarity search for the structural properties of their own data.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing allows for characterizing the gene expression landscape at the cell type level. However, because of its use of short-reads, it is severely limited at detecting full-length features of transcripts such as alternative splicing. New library preparation techniques attempt to extend single-cell sequencing by utilizing both long-and short-reads. These techniques split the library material, after it is tagged with cellular barcodes, into two pools: one for short-read sequencing and one for long-read sequencing. However, the challenge of utilizing these techniques is that they require matching the cellular barcodes sequenced by the erroneous long-reads to the cellular barcodes detected by the short-reads. To overcome this challenge, we introduce scTagger, a computational method to match cellular barcodes data from long-and short-reads. We tested scTagger against another state-of-the-art tool on both real and simulated datasets and we demonstrate that scTagger has both significantly better accuracy and time efficiency.",

Our previous study showed that Hi-LASSO outperformed the other state-of-the-art LASSO methods.

In this paper, the Python package and its Spark library are efficiently implemented in a parallel manner for practice with real-world problems, as well as providing the capability of the parametric statistical tests for feature selection on high-dimensional data. We demonstrate Hi-LASSOs outperformance with various intensive experiments in a practical manner. Hi-LASSO will be efficiently and easily performed by using the packages for feature selection.

    "abstract": "Effective control of false discovery rate is key for multiplicity problems. Here, we consider incorporating informative covariates from external datasets in the multiple testing procedure to boost statistical power while maintaining false discovery rate control. In particular, we focus on the statistical analysis of innovative high-dimensional spatial transcriptomic data while incorporating external multi-omics data that provide distinct but complementary information to the detection of spatial expression patterns. We extend OrderShapeEM, an efficient covariate-assisted multiple testing procedure that incorporates one auxiliary study, to make it permissible to incorporate multiple external omics studies, to boost statistical power of spatial expression pattern detection. Specifically, we first use a recently proposed computationally efficient statistical analysis method, spatial pattern recognition via kernels, to produce the primary test statistics for spatial transcriptomic data. Afterwards, we construct the auxiliary covariate by combining information from multiple external omics studies, such as bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data and genome wise association study data, using the Cauchy combination rule. Finally, we extend and implement the integrative analysis method OrderShapeEM on the primary p-values along with auxiliary data incorporating multi-omics information for efficient covariate-assisted spatial expression analysis. We conduct a series of realistic simulations to evaluate the performance of our method with known ground truth. Four case studies in mouse olfactory bulb, mouse cerebellum, human breast cancer and human heart tissues further demonstrate the substantial power gain of our method in detecting genes with spatial expression patterns compared to existing classic approaches that do not utilize any external information.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates present in cells can fundamentally affect the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins and play a role in the regulation of this process. While liquid-liquid phase separation of amyloidogenic proteins by themselves can act as an alternative nucleation pathway, interaction of partly disordered aggregation-prone proteins with pre-existing condensates that act as localization centers could be a far more general mechanism of altering their aggregation behavior. Here, we show that so-called host biomolecular condensates can both accelerate and slow down amyloid formation. We study the amyloidogenic protein -synuclein and two truncated -synuclein variants in the presence of three types of condensates composed of non-aggregating peptides, RNA or ATP. Our results demonstrate that condensates can dramatically speed up amyloid formation when proteins localize to their interface. However, condensates can also significantly suppress aggregation by sequestering and stabilizing amyloidogenic proteins, thereby providing living cells with a possible protection mechanism against amyloid formation.",

    "abstract": "During cell division, crosslinking motors determine the architecture of the spindle, a dynamic microtubule network that segregates the chromosomes. It is unclear how motors with opposite directionality coordinate to drive both contractile and extensile behaviors in the spindle. Particularly, the impact of different crosslinker designs on network self-organization is not understood, limiting our understanding of self-organizing structures in cells, but also our ability to engineer new active materials. Here, we use experiment and theory to examine active microtubule networks driven by mixtures of motors with opposite directionality and different crosslinker design. We find that although the kinesin-14 HSET causes network contraction when dominant, it can also assist the opposing kinesin-5 KIF11 to generate extensile networks. This bifunctionality results from HSETs asymmetric design, distinct from symmetric KIF11. These findings expand the set of rules underlying patterning of active microtubule assemblies and allow a better understanding of motor cooperation in the spindle.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDuring cell division, the spindle apparatus segregates duplicated chromosomes for their inheritance by the daughter cells. The spindle is a highly interconnected network of microtubule filaments that are crosslinked by different types of molecular motors. How the different motors cooperate to organize the spindle network is not understood. Here, we show that an asymmetric crosslinker design can confer bifunctionality to a mitotic motor in the presence of other motors. The asymmetric motor supports both extensile and contractile microtubule network behaviors as observed in different parts of the spindle. These findings define new rules controlling the generation of active microtubule networks and allow us to better understand how motors cooperate to organize the correct spindle architecture when a cell divides.",

    "abstract": "Control of biomolecular condensates may hold considerable therapeutic potential. Intracellular condensates are highly multi-component systems in which complex phase behaviour can ensue, including the formation of architectures comprising multiple immiscible condensed phases. Conceivable avenues for manipulating condensates to bypass pathologies thus extend beyond merely controlling their stability and material properties, and relying solely on physical intuition to manipulate them is difficult because of the complexity of their composition. We address this challenge by developing an efficient computational approach to design pairs of protein sequences that result in well-separated multilayered condensates. Our method couples a genetic algorithm to a residue-resolution coarse-grained protein model. We demonstrate that we can design protein partners to form multiphase condensates containing naturally occurring proteins, such as the low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1 and its mutants, and show how homo- and heterotypic interactions must differ between proteins to result in multiphasicity.",

    "abstract": "The high incidence of melanoma has received significant attention. Despite advances in early detection and standard treatment options, new strategies that improve therapy with reduced side effects are highly desirable. Several studies have demonstrated the efficiency of doxorubicin (Dox) to treat melanoma, however, side effects limit its clinical use. Drug delivery systems, especially nanostructured ones, are a useful approach to enhance antitumor activity and reduce the toxicity of drugs. Here, we report the use of calcium phosphate nanoparticles functionalized with Dox and hyaluronic acid (N-Dox) to enhance Dox antiproliferative activity. The effects were accessed in A-375 melanoma cells, in which N-Dox significantly decreased IC50 over 48 hours (0.142 {+/-} 0.07) compared to the free drug (0.44 {+/-} 0.25). Treatment triggered DNA damage, increased nuclear area, and senescent phenotype. Furthermore, it did not form colonies after 14 days of incubation preceded by short exposure treatment. These preliminary results indicate that N-Dox hold promise for melanoma treatment, reducing the minimum effective dose and perhaps a reduction in the cost of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Despite limited evidence for competent infection and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system (CNS), neurologic dysfunction is a common post-acute medical condition reported in \"recovered\" COVID-19 patients. To identify a potential noninfectious route for SARS-CoV-2-mediated neurological damage, we constructed colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots linked to micelles decorated with spike protein (COVID-QDs) as a biomimetic to interrogate how blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysregulation may subsequently induce neuroinflammation in the absence of infection. In transwell co-culture of endothelial bEnd.3 monolayers and primary neuroglia, we exposed only the bEnd.3 monolayers to COVID-QDs and examined by fluorescence microscopy whether such treatment led to (i) increased inflammation and leakage across the bEnd.3 monolayers, (ii) permeability of the COVID-QDs across the monolayers, and (iii) induction of neuroinflammation in neuroglial cultures. The results of our study provide evidence of neuroinflammatory hallmarks in cultured neurons and astrocytes without direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2-like nanoparticles. Additionally, we found that pre-treatment of our co-cultures with a small-molecule, broad-spectrum inhibitor of mixed lineage and leucine rich repeat kinases led to reversal of the observed dysregulation in endothelial monolayers and resulted in neuroglial protection.

    "abstract": "Changes in neurotransmitter receptor abundance at post-synaptic elements play a pivotal role in regulating synaptic strength. For this reason, there is significant interest in identifying and characterizing the scaffolds required for receptor localization at different synapses. Here we analyze the role of two C. elegans post-synaptic scaffolding proteins (LIN-2/CASK and FRM-3/FARP) at cholinergic neuromuscular junctions. Constitutive knockouts or muscle specific inactivation of lin-2 and frm-3 dramatically reduced spontaneous and evoked post-synaptic currents. These synaptic defects resulted from the decreased abundance of two classes of post-synaptic ionotropic acetylcholine receptors (ACR-16/CHRNA7 and levamisole-activated AChRs). LIN-2s AChR scaffolding function is mediated by its SH3 and PDZ domains, which interact with AChRs and FRM-3/FARP, respectively. Thus, our findings show that post-synaptic LIN-2/FRM-3 complexes promote cholinergic synaptic transmission by recruiting AChRs to post-synaptic elements.",

    "abstract": "Understanding of the neural bases for complex behaviors in Hymenoptera insect species has been limited by a lack of tools that allow measuring neuronal activity simultaneously in different brain regions. Here, we developed the first pan-neuronal genetic driver in a Hymenopteran model organism, the honey bee, and expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f under the control of the honey bee synapsin promoter. We show that GCaMP6f is widely expressed in the honey bee brain, allowing to record neural activity from multiple brain regions. To assess the power of this tool, we focused on the olfactory system, recording simultaneous responses from the antennal lobe, and from the more poorly investigated lateral horn and mushroom body calyces. Neural responses to 16 distinct odorants demonstrate that odorant quality (chemical structure) and quantity are faithfully encoded in the honey bee antennal lobe. In contrast, odor coding in the lateral horn departs from this simple physico-chemical coding, supporting the role of this structure in coding the biological value of odorants. We further demonstrate robust neural responses to several bee pheromone odorants, key drivers of social behavior, in the lateral horn. Combined, these brain recordings represent the first use of a neurogenetic tool for recording large-scale neural activity in a eusocial insect, and will be of utility in assessing the neural underpinnings of olfactory and other sensory modalities and of social behaviors and cognitive abilities.",

    "abstract": "Neural computations emerge from recurrent neural circuits that comprise hundreds to a few thousand neurons. Continuous progress in connectomics, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging require tractable spiking network models that can consistently incorporate new information about the network structure and reproduce the recorded neural activity features. However, it is challenging to predict which spiking network connectivity configurations and neural properties can generate fundamental operational states and specific experimentally reported nonlinear cortical computations. Theoretical descriptions for the computational state of cortical spiking circuits are diverse, including the balanced state where excitatory and inhibitory inputs balance almost perfectly or the inhibition stabilized state (ISN) where the excitatory part of the circuit is unstable. It remains an open question whether these states can co-exist with experimentally reported nonlinear computations and whether they can be recovered in biologically realistic implementations of spiking networks. Here, we show how to identify spiking network connectivity patterns underlying diverse nonlinear computations such as XOR, bistability, inhibitory stabilization, supersaturation, and persistent activity. We established a mapping between the stabilized supralinear network (SSN) and spiking activity which allowed us to pinpoint the location in parameter space where these activity regimes occur. Notably, we found that biologically-sized spiking networks can have irregular asynchronous activity that does not require strong excitation-inhibition balance or large feedforward input and we showed that the dynamic firing rate trajectories in spiking networks can be precisely targeted without error-driven training algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesFluid biomarkers are a recent field of interest in Huntington disease (HD). We focused on small circulating RNAs from plasma of subjects with prodromal (pre-HD) and overt disease by a two-stage approach: an unbiased investigation by an array method and a validation study to quantify a significant small nucleolar RNA.\n\nMethodsThrough Affymetrix Gene-Chip-miRNA-Array we performed an exploratory study on 9 HD patients, 8 healthy subjects (HS) and 5 psychiatric patients (PP; who share drugs with HD patients, to control for iatrogenic effects). Through real time PCR we validated the results in an independent population of 24 HD patients, 15 pre-HD, 24 PP, 28 Alzheimers disease (AD) patients (added to control the disease-specificity of our finding) and 23 HS. A bioinformatic analysis was also performed to interpret our finding.\n\nResultsThe microarray results showed a significant signal for U13 small nucleolar RNA (SNORD13) that was increased in plasma of HD patients compared to controls (fold change, 1.54, p =0.003 HD vs. HS, and fold change 1.44 p = 0.0026 HD vs. PP). In the validation population the significant increase in HD patients was evident compared to both pre-HD and the three control groups (p<0.00001). The plasma levels of SNORD13 correlated with the status of mutant huntingtin carrier and the disease duration (respectively R=0.69; p<0.000001; R=0.49; p=0.015). Through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we showed high accuracy of plasmatic SNORD13 in discriminating HD patients from pre-HD and control groups (AUC=0.963), outperforming values reported in another study for intrathecal or plasmatic mutant huntingtin and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of overt HD. The bioinformatic analysis on SNORD13 interactome and pathway analysis showed enrichments for factors involved in nuclear functions beyond the ribosome biogenesis.\n\nDiscussionWe report the unprecedented finding of a potential role of small nucleolar RNAs in HD. Circulating SNORD13 seems a good biomarker for clinical purposes. It seems to be specific for HD and to peripherally report a plausible  tipping point in the pathogenic cascade at neuronal level, possibly paving the way for new therapeutic targets.",

Previous neuroimaging studies investigating facial expression processing have presented pre-recorded stimuli and lacked live face-to-face interaction. Our paradigm alternated between presentations of real-time model performance and pre-recorded videos of dynamic facial expressions to participants. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and facial electromyography activity recordings, as well as post-scan valence and arousal ratings were acquired from 44 female participants. Live facial expressions enhanced the subjective valence and arousal ratings as well as facial muscular responses. Live performances showed greater engagement of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right amygdala and right fusiform gyrus, and modulated the effective connectivity within the right mirror neuron system (IFG, pSTS, and right inferior parietal lobule). A support vector machine algorithm could classify multivoxel activation patterns in brain regions involved in dynamic facial expression processing in the mentalizing networks (anterior and posterior cingulate cortex). These results indicate that live social interaction modulates the activity and connectivity of the right mirror neuron system and enhances spontaneous mimicry, further facilitating emotional contagion.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe alternately presented real-time and pre-recorded dynamic facial expressions.\nC_LIO_LILive facial expressions enhanced emotion contagion and spontaneous facial mimicry.\nC_LIO_LILive conditions modulated mirror neuron system activity and effective connectivity.\nC_LIO_LIThe mentalizing network showed distinctive multivoxel patterns in live conditions.\nC_LIO_LIThe results support the validity of second-person design in social neuroscience.\nC_LI",

Here, we phenotypically and genotypically characterize two additional strains that were previously obtained from soil samples and compare the results to the type strain. Complete genomes for both strains were assembled from hybrid Illumina and Nanopore sequencing reads and annotated. Further genomic analysis including average nucleotide identity (ANI) and detection of mobile genetic elements and genes of interest (e.g., virulence-associated) were conducted. The strains showed 98.7-98.8% ANI with the type strain. The UTK C1-0015 genome contained a partial monocin locus and a plasmid while the UTK C1-0024 genome contained a full monocin locus and a prophage. Phenotypic characterization consistent with those performed on the proposed type strain was conducted to assess consistency of phenotypes across a greater diversity of the proposed species (n=3 instead of n=1). Only a few findings were notably different from those of the type strain, such as catalase activity, glycerol metabolism, starch metabolism, and growth at 41{degrees}C.

    "abstract": "Genome instability can drive aging in many organisms. The ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) cluster is one of the most unstable regions in the genome. Replicative lifespan in budding yeast is correlated to rDNA stability, suggesting that the rDNA locus produces an aging signal. To understand the underlying mechanism, we looked for yeast mutants with more stable rDNA and longer lifespan than wild-type cells. We reveal that absence of a transcription elongation factor, Spt4, resulted in an increased rDNA stability, a reduced activity of the regulatory E-pro promoter in the rDNA, and extended replicative lifespan in a SIR2-dependent manner. Spt4-dependent lifespan restriction was abolished in the absence of non-coding RNA transcription at the E-pro locus. The amount of Spt4 increases and its function becomes more important as cells age. These findings suggest that Spt4 is a promising aging factor that accelerates cellular senescence through rDNA instability driven by non-coding RNA transcription",

    "abstract": "Specification of the germ layers by Nodal signaling has long been regarded as an archetype of how graded morphogens induce different cell fates. However, this deterministic model cannot explain why only a subset of cells at the margin of the early zebrafish embryo adopt the endodermal fate, while their immediate neighbours, experiencing similar signaling profiles, become mesoderm. Combining pharmacology, quantitative imaging and single cell transcriptomics, we demonstrate that sustained Nodal signaling establishes a bipotential progenitor state where cells initially fated to become mesoderm can switch to an endodermal fate. Switching is a random event, the likelihood of which is modulated by Fgf signaling. This inherently imprecise mechanism nevertheless leads to robust endoderm formation because of buffering at later stages. Thus, in contrast to previous deterministic models of morphogen action, Nodal establishes a temporal window when cells are competent to undergo a stochastic cell fate switch, rather than determining fate itself.",

    "abstract": "Ciliopathies represent a disease class characterized by a broad range of phenotypes including polycystic kidneys and skeletal anomalies. Ciliopathic skeletal phenotypes are among the most common and most difficult to treat due to a poor understanding of the pathological mechanisms leading to disease. Using an avian model (talpid2) for a human ciliopathy with skeletal anomalies (Orofaciodigital syndrome 14), we identified disruptions in the FGF23-PTH axis that resulted in reduced calcium uptake in the developing mandible and subsequent micrognathia. While pharmacological intervention with the FDA-approved pan-FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 alone rescued expression of the FGF target Sprouty2, it did not significantly rescue micrognathia. In contrast, treatment with a cocktail of AZD4547 and Teriparatide acetate, a PTH agonist and FDA-approved treatment for osteoporosis, resulted in a molecular, cellular, and phenotypic rescue of ciliopathic micrognathia in talpid2 mutants. Together, these data provide novel insight into pathological molecular mechanisms associated with ciliopathic skeletal phenotypes and a potential therapeutic strategy for a pleiotropic disease class with limited to no treatment options.\n\nSummary StatementTreatment options for ciliopathic phenotypes are very limited. Using an avian model, we report a novel molecular mechanism and potential therapeutic treatment for ciliopathic micrognathia.",

    "abstract": "Increased phenotypic similarity between partners, termed assortative mating (AM), has been observed for many traits. However, it is currently unclear if these observations are due to mate choice for certain phenotypes, post-mating convergence, or a result of confounding factors such as shared environment or indirect assortment. To dissect these underlying phenomena, we applied Mendelian randomisation (MR) to 51,664 couples in the UK biobank to a panel of 118 phenotypes under AM. We found that 54% (64 of 118) of the tested traits had a causal relationship between partners, with female-to-male effects on average being larger. Forty traits, including systolic blood pressure, basal metabolic rate, weight and height, showed significantly larger phenotypic correlation than MR-estimates, suggesting the presence of confounders. Subsequent analyses revealed household income, overall health rating, education and tobacco smoking as major overall confounders, accounting for 29.8, 14.1, 11.6, and 4.78%, of cross-partner phenotypic correlations, respectively. We detected limited evidence for couple-correlation convergence (e.g. increased similarity with respect to smoking and medication use), measured by stratifying couples by their time spent together. Finally, mediation analysis revealed that the vast majority (>77%) of causal associations between one trait of an individual and a different trait of their partner is indirect. For example, the causal effect of the BMI of an individual on the overall health rating of their partner is entirely acting through the BMI of their partner. In summary, this study revealed many novel causal effects within couples, shedding light on the impact of confounding on couple phenotypic similarity.",

Yet little is known about viruses in passerines, and in some countries, including New Zealand, the virome of wild passerines has received little research attention. Using metatranscriptomic sequencing we characterised the virome of New Zealand endemic and introduced species of passerine. Accordingly, we identified 34 possible avian viruses from cloacal swabs of 12 endemic and introduced bird species not showing signs of disease. These included a novel siadenovirus, iltovirus and avastrovirus in the Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula, an introduced species), song thrush (Turdus philomelos, introduced) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis, introduced), respectively. This is the first time novel viruses from these genera have been identified in New Zealand, likely reflecting prior undersampling. It also represents the first identification of an iltovirus and siadenovirus in blackbirds and thrushes globally. These three viruses were found only in introduced species and may pose a risk to endemic species if they were to jump species boundaries, particularly the iltoviruses and siadenoviruses that have a prior history of disease associations. Further virus study and surveillance is needed in New Zealand avifauna, particularly in Turdus populations and endemic species.",

    "abstract": "While biofilms formed by bacteria have received great attention due to their importance in pathogenesis, much less research has been focused on the biofilms formed by archaea. It has been known that extracellular filaments in archaea, such as Type IV pili, hami and cannulae, play a part in the formation of archaeal biofilms. We have used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the atomic structure of a previously uncharacterized class of archaeal surface filaments from hyperthermophilic Pyrobaculum calidifontis. These filaments, which we call archaeal bundling pili (ABP), assemble into highly ordered bipolar bundles. The bipolar nature of these bundles most likely arises from the association of filaments from at least two different cells. The component protein shows homology, both at the sequence and structural level, to the bacterial protein TasA, a major component of the extracellular matrix in bacterial biofilms, contributing to biofilm stability. We show that ABP forms very stable filaments in a manner similar to the donor-strand exchange of bacterial TasA fibers and chaperone-usher pathway pili where a {beta}-strand from one subunit is incorporated into a {beta}-sheet of the next subunit. Our results reveal mechanistic similarities and evolutionary connection between bacterial and archaeal biofilms, and suggest that there could be many other archaeal surface filaments that are as yet uncharacterized.\n\nSignificanceBiofilms are communities of microbes where cells attach to each other as well as to surfaces, and bacterial biofilms have been intensively studied due to their importance in many infections. Much less has been known about archaeal biofilms, where archaea are a third domain of life. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined the atomic structure of a surface filament in archaea that forms bi-polar bundles connecting cells. We show that this protein has common ancestry with a protein known to be an important component of bacterial biofilms. This adds to our understanding of the evolutionary relationship between bacteria and archaea and may provide new insights into bacterial biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Actomyosin is a canonical example of an active material, driven out of equilibrium in part through the injection of energy by myosin motors. This influx of energy allows actomyosin networks to generate cellular-scale contractility, which underlies cellular processes ranging from division to migration. While the molecular players underlying actomyosin contractility have been well characterized, how cellular-scale deformation in disordered actomyosin networks emerges from filament-scale interactions is not well understood. Here, we address this question in vivo using the meiotic surface contraction wave of Patiria miniata oocytes. Using pharmacological treatments targeting actin polymerization, we find that the cellular deformation rate is a nonmonotonic function of cortical actin density peaked near the wild type density. To understand this, we develop an active fluid model coarse-grained from filament-scale interactions and find quantitative agreement with the measured data. This model further predicts the dependence of the deformation rate on the concentration of passive actin crosslinkers and motor proteins, including the surprising prediction that deformation rate decreases with increasing motor concentration. We test these predictions through protein overexpression and find quantitative agreement. Taken together, this work is an important step for bridging the molecular and cellular length scales for cytoskeletal networks in vivo.",

Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and spatial statistics, we observed that lysosomal exocytosis is not random at the adhesive part of the plasma membrane of RPE1 cells but clustered at different scales. Although the rate of exocytosis is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton, neither interfering with actin or microtubule dynamics by drug treatments alters its spatial organization. Exocytosis events partially co-appear at focal adhesions (FAs) and their clustering is reduced upon removal of FAs. Changes in membrane tension following a hypo-osmotic shock or treatment with methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin was found to increase clustering. To investigate the link between FAs and membrane tension, cells were cultured on adhesive ring-shaped micropatterns, which allows to control the spatial organization of FAs. By using a combination of TIRFM and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) microscopy, we revealed the existence of a radial gradient in membrane tension. By changing the diameter of micropatterned substrates, we further showed that this gradient as well as the extent of exocytosis clustering can be controlled. Together, our data indicate that the spatial clustering of lysosomal exocytosis relies on membrane tension patterning controlled by the spatial organization of FAs.",

    "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is an aggressive kidney cancer driven by VHL loss and aberrant HIF-2 signaling. Acetate metabolism may contribute to this axis by ACSS2-dependent acetylation of HIF-2 and may provide opportunities to intervention. Here we tested the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulation of ACSS2 on HIF-2, ccRCC cells, and tumors. ACSS2 inhibition led to HIF-2 degradation and suppressed ccRCC growth in vitro, in vivo, and in primary cell cultures of ccRCC patient tumors. This treatment resulted in reduced glucose and cholesterol metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis and altered cristae deformation, that are consistent with loss of HIF-2. Mechanistically, HIF-2 protein levels are regulated through proteolytic degradation and we found, in parallel to VHL, HIF-2 stability was dependent on ACSS2 activity to prevent direct interaction with the E3 ligase MUL1. These findings highlight ACSS2 as a critical upstream regulator of HIF-2 that may be exploited to overcome resistance to HIF-2 inhibitor therapies.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe have unveiled ACSS2 as a critical upstream regulator of HIF-2 in ccRCC. Targeting ACSS2 potently promotes HIF-2 degradation via MUL1 to effectively deplete mitochondrial activity and block ccRCC primary tumor models and growth models resistant to HIF-2 inhibitor therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDifferences in the clinical course and treatment responses in individual patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can largely be explained by the different genomics of this disease. To improve the personalized treatment strategy and survival outcomes for patients with advanced RCC, the genomic make-up in patients with advanced RCC was investigated to identify putative actionable mutations and signatures.\n\nMethodsIn this prospective multicenter study (NCT01855477), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of locally advanced and metastatic tissue biopsies and matched whole-blood samples were collected from 91 patients with histopathologically confirmed RCC. WGS data were analyzed for small somatic variants, copy-number alterations and structural variants. For a subgroup of patients, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data could be analyzed. RNA-Seq data were clustered on immunogenic and angiogenic gene expression patterns according to a previously developed angio-immunogenic gene signature.\n\nResultsFor papillary and clear cell RCC, putative actionable drug targets were detected by WGS in 100% of the patients. RNA-Seq data of clear cell and papillary RCC were clustered using a previously developed angio-immunogenic gene signature. Analyses of driver mutations and RNA-Seq data revealed clear differences among different RCC subtypes, showing the added value of WGS and RNA-Seq over clinicopathological data.\n\nConclusionsBy improving both histological subtyping and the selection of treatment according to actionable targets and immune signatures, WGS and RNA-Seq may improve therapeutic decision making for most patients with advanced RCC, including patients with non-clear cell RCC for whom no standard treatment is available to data. Prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate the impact of genomic and transcriptomic diagnostics on survival outcome for advanced RCC patients.",

    "abstract": "The genus Viola (Violaceae) is among the 40-50 largest genera among angiosperms, yet its taxonomy has not been revised for nearly a century. In the most recent revision, by Wilhelm Becker in 1925, the then known 400 species were distributed among 14 sections and numerous unranked groups. Here we provide an updated, comprehensive classification of the genus, based on data from phylogeny, morphology, chromosome counts, and ploidy, and based on modern principles of monophyly. The revision is presented as an annotated global checklist of accepted species of Viola, an updated multigene phylogenetic network and an ITS phylogeny with denser taxon sampling, a brief summary of the taxonomic changes from Beckers classification and their justification, a morphological binary key to the accepted subgenera, sections and subsections, and an account of each infrageneric subdivision with justifications for delimitation and rank including a description, a list of apomorphies, molecular phylogenies where possible or relevant, a distribution map, and a list of included species. We subdivide the 658 species accepted by us into 2 subgenera, 31 sections, and 20 subsections. We erect one new subgenus of Viola (subg. Neoandinium, a replacement name for the illegitimate subg. Andinium), six new sections (sect. Abyssinium, sect. Himalayum, sect. Melvio, sect. Nematocaulon, sect. Spathulidium, sect. Xanthidium), and seven new subsections (subsect. Australasiaticae, subsect. Bulbosae, subsect. Clausenianae, subsect. Cleistogamae, subsect. Dispares, subsect. Formosanae, subsect. Pseudorupestres). Evolution within the genus is discussed in light of biogeography, fossil record, morphology, and particular traits. Viola is among very few temperate and widespread genera that originated in South America. The biggest identified knowledge gaps for Viola concern the South American taxa, for which basic knowledge from phylogeny, chromosome counts, and fossil data is virtually absent. Viola has also never been subject to comprehensive anatomical study. Study on seed anatomy and morphology is required to understand the fossil record of the genus.",

Here, we used available metagenomics data from a metformin study, together with genome-scale metabolic modelling of the key bacteria in individual and community-level to investigate the mechanistic role of the gut microbiome in response to metformin. Individual modelling predicted that species that are increased after metformin treatment have higher growth rates in comparison to species that are decreased after metformin treatment. Gut microbial enrichment analysis showed prior to metformin treatment pathways related to the hypoglycemic effect were enriched. Our observations highlight how the key bacterial species after metformin treatment have commensal and competing behavior, and how their cellular metabolism changes due to different nutritional environment. Integrating different diets showed there were specific microbial alterations between different diets. These results show the importance of the nutritional environment and how the dietary guidelines may improve drug efficiency through the gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and its major downstream target within the basal ganglia--the rostromedial caudate nucleus (rmCD)--are involved in reward-value processing and goal-directed behavior. However, a causal contribution of the pathway linking these two structures to goal-directed behavior has not been established. Using the chemogenetic technology of Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs with a crossed inactivation design, we functionally and reversibly disrupted interactions between the OFC and rmCD in two male macaque monkeys. We injected an adeno-associated virus vector expressing an inhibitory designer receptor (hM4Di) into the OFC and contralateral rmCD, the expression of which was visualized in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) and confirmed by post-mortem immunohistochemistry. Functional disconnection of the OFC and rmCD resulted in a significant and reproducible loss of sensitivity to the cued reward value for goal-directed action. This decreased sensitivity was most prominent when monkeys had accumulated a certain amount of reward. These results provide causal evidence that the interaction between the OFC and the rmCD is needed for motivational control of action on the basis of the relative reward value and internal drive. This finding extends current understanding of the physiological basis of psychiatric disorders in which goal-directed behavior is affected, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nSignificance StatementIn daily life, we routinely adjust the speed and accuracy of our actions on the basis of the value of expected reward. Abnormalities in these kinds of motivational adjustments might be related to behaviors seen in psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the current study, we show that the connection from the orbitofrontal cortex to the rostromedial caudate nucleus is essential formotivational control of action in monkeys. This finding expands our knowledge about how the primate brain controls motivation and behavior and provides a particular insight into disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder, in which altered connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the striatum has been implicated.",

We also generated an antibody against the PmCRH mature peptide to study the distribution of PmCRH-immunoreactive cells and fibers. PmCRH immunohistochemistry was combined with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, PmCRHBP in situ hybridization or neurobiotin transport from the spinal cord. The most numerous PmCRH-expressing cells were observed in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus-paraventricular nucleus and in the superior and medial rhombencephalic reticular formation. PmCRH expression was more extended in adults than in larvae, and some cell populations were mainly (olfactory bulb) or only (striatum, ventral hypothalamus, prethalamus) observed in adults. The preopto-paraventricular fibers form conspicuous tracts coursing towards the neurohypophysis, but many immunoreactive fibers were also observed coursing in many other brain regions. Brain descending fibers in the spinal cord come from cells located in the isthmus and in the medial rhombencephalic reticular nucleus. The distribution of PmCRHBP-expressing neurons was different from that of PmCRH cells, with cells mainly present in the septum, striatum, preoptic region, tuberal hypothalamus, pretectum, pineal complex, isthmus, reticular formation, and spinal cord. Again, expression in adults was more extended than in larvae. PmCRH- and PmCRHBP-expressing cells are different, excluding colocalization of these substances in the same neuron. Present findings reveal a complex CRH/CRHBP system in the brain of the oldest extant vertebrate group, the agnathans, which shows similarities but important divergences with that of mammals.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious respiratory virus and the causative agent for COVID-19. The severity of disease varies from mildly symptomatic to lethal and shows an extraordinary correlation with increasing age, which represents the major risk factor for severe COVID-191. However, the precise pathomechanisms leading to aggravated disease in the elderly are currently unknown. Delayed and insufficient antiviral immune responses early after infection as well as dysregulated and overshooting immunopathological processes late during disease were suggested as possible mechanisms. Here we show that the age-dependent increase of COVID-19 severity is caused by the disruption of a timely and well-coordinated innate and adaptive immune response due to impaired interferon (IFN) responses. To overcome the limitations of mechanistic studies in humans, we generated a mouse model for severe COVID-19 and compared the kinetics of the immune responses in adult and aged mice at different time points after infection. Aggravated disease in aged mice was characterized by a diminished IFN-{gamma} response and excessive virus replication. Accordingly, adult IFN-{gamma} receptor-deficient mice phenocopied the age-related disease severity and supplementation of IFN-{gamma} reversed the increased disease susceptibility of aged mice.\n\nMimicking impaired type I IFN immunity in adult and aged mice, a second major risk factor for severe COVID-192-4, we found that therapeutic treatment with IFN-{lambda} in adult and a combinatorial treatment with IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{lambda} in aged Ifnar1-/-mice was highly efficient in protecting against severe disease.\n\nOur findings provide an explanation for the age-dependent disease severity of COVID-19 and clarify the nonredundant antiviral functions of type I, II and III IFNs during SARS-CoV-2 infection in an age-dependent manner. Based on our data, we suggest that highly vulnerable individuals combining both risk factors, advanced age and an impaired type I IFN immunity, may greatly benefit from immunotherapy combining IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{lambda}.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many prophylactic and therapeutic drugs have been evaluated and introduced. Among these treatments, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus have been applied as complementary and alternative treatments to vaccines. Although different methodologies have been utilized to produce mAbs, traditional hybridoma fusion technology is still commonly used for this purpose due to its unmatched performance record. In this study, we coupled the hybridoma fusion strategy with mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) immunization. This time-saving approach can circumvent biological and technical hurdles, such as difficult to express membrane proteins, antigen instability, and the lack of posttranslational modifications on recombinant antigens. We used mRNA-LNP immunization and hybridoma fusion technology to generate mAbs against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. Compared with traditional protein-based immunization approaches, inoculation of mice with RBD mRNA-LNP induced higher titers of serum antibodies. In addition, the mAbs we obtained can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBDs from several variants. Notably, RBD-mAb-3 displayed particularly high binding affinities and neutralizing potencies against both Alpha and Delta variants. In addition to introducing specific mAbs against SARS-CoV-2, our data generally demonstrate that mRNA-LNP immunization may be useful to quickly generate highly functional mAbs against emerging infectious diseases.",

Here we show that false-priming and self-priming occur during reverse transcription with several published Zika virus (ZIKV) primer sets. We developed a RT-qPCR assay using tagged primers and thermostable reverse transcriptase, which greatly reduced the occurrence of nonspecific cDNA products. Furthermore, we optimized the assay for use in multiplex qPCR which allows for simultaneous quantitative detection of positive-strand and negative-strand ZIKV RNA along with an internal control from both human and mosquito cells. Importantly, this assay is sensitive enough to study early stages of virus infection in vitro. Strikingly, using this assay, we detected ZIKV negative-strand RNA as early as 3 h post-infection in mammalian cell culture, at a time point prior to the onset of positive-strand RNA synthesis. Overall, the strand-specific RT-qPCR assay developed herein is a valuable tool to quantify ZIKV RNA and to study viral replication dynamics during infection. The application of these findings has the potential to increase accuracy of RNA detection methods for a variety of viral pathogens.\n\nHighlightsO_LISelf-primed cDNA is amplified by widely-used ZIKV qPCR primer sets\nC_LIO_LIUse of tagged primers and thermostable RT increases strand-specificity for RT-qPCR\nC_LIO_LIMultiplexed qPCR allows for simultaneous quantitation of (+) and (-) strand viral RNAs, and an internal control\nC_LIO_LIStrand-specific RT-qPCR can detect fewer than one copy of viral RNA per cell in human and mosquito cells\nC_LI",

SARS-CoV-2 The variant B.1.1.529 (Omicron) emerged in late 2020 and has continued to evolve and is now present in several distinct sub-variants. Here, we analyzed the \"furin cleavage site\" of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron variant) in vitro, to assess the role of two key mutations (spike, N679K and P681H) that are common across all subvariants compared to the ancestral B.1 virus and other notable lineages. We observed significantly increased intrinsic cleavability with furin compared to an original B lineage virus (Wuhan-Hu1), as well as to two variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617 (Delta) that subsequently had wide circulation. Increased furin-mediated cleavage was attributed to the N679K mutation, which lies outside the conventional furin binding pocket. Our findings suggest that B.1.1.529 (Omicron variant) has gained genetic features linked to intrinsic furin cleavability, in line with its evolution within the population as the COVID-19 pandemic has proceeded.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe rhizosphere is a hotspot for microbial activity and contributes to ecosystem services including plant health and biogeochemical cycling. The activity of microbial viruses, and their influence on plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, remains undetermined. Given the impact of viruses on the ecology and evolution of their host communities, determining how soil viruses influence microbiome dynamics is crucial to build a holistic understanding of rhizosphere functions.\n\nResultsHere, we aimed to investigate the influence of crop management on the composition and activity of bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root viral communities. We combined viromics, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics on soil samples collected from a 3-year crop rotation field trial of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). By recovering 1,059 dsDNA viral populations and 16,541 ssRNA bacteriophage populations, we expanded the number of underexplored Leviviricetes genomes by > 5 times. Through detection of viral activity in metatranscriptomes, we uncovered evidence of \"Kill-the-Winner\" dynamics, implicating soil bacteriophages in driving bacterial community succession. Moreover, we found the activity of viruses increased with proximity to crop roots and identified that soil viruses may influence plant-microbe interactions through the reprogramming of bacterial host metabolism. We have provided the first evidence of crop rotation-driven impacts on soil microbial communities extending to viruses. To this aim, we present the novel principal of \"viral priming\", which describes how the consecutive growth of the same crop species primes viral activity in the rhizosphere through local adaptation.\n\nConclusionsOverall, we reveal unprecedented spatial and temporal diversity in viral community composition and activity across root, rhizosphere soil and bulk soil compartments. Our work demonstrates that the roles of soil viruses need greater consideration to exploit the rhizosphere microbiome for food security, food safety, and environmental sustainability.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a fatty acid binding site, also found in some other coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV), which binds linoleic acid and is functionally important. When occupied by linoleic acid, it reduces infectivity, by  locking the spike in a less infectious conformation. Here, we use dynamical-nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations to compare the response of spike variants to linoleic acid removal. These simulations show that the fatty acid site is coupled to functional regions of the protein, some of them far from the site (e.g. in the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, the furin cleavage site located in position 679-685 and the fusion peptide-surrounding regions) and identify the allosteric networks involved in these connections. Comparison of the response of the original ( Wuhan) spike with four variants: Alpha, Delta, Delta plus and Omicron BA.1 show that the variants differ significantly in their response to linoleic acid removal. The allosteric connections to the fatty acid site on Alpha are generally similar to the original protein, except for the receptor-binding motif and S71-R78 region which show a weaker link to the FA site. In contrast, Omicron is the most affected variant exhibiting significant differences in the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, V622-L629 and the furin cleavage site. These differences in allosteric modulation may be of functional relevance, e.g. in differences in transmissibility and virulence. Experimental comparison of the effects of linoleic acid on different variants is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Global high-throughput profiling of oncogenic signaling pathways by phosphoproteomics is increasingly being applied to cancer specimens. Such quantitative unbiased phosphoproteomic profiling of cancer cells identifies oncogenic signaling cascades that drive disease initiation and progression; pathways that are often invisible to genomics sequencing strategies. Therefore, phosphoproteomic profiling has immense potential for informing individualized anti-cancer treatments. However, complicated and extensive sample preparation protocols, coupled with intricate chromatographic separation techniques that are necessary to achieve adequate phosphoproteomic depth, limits the clinical utility of these techniques. Traditionally, phosphoproteomics is performed using isobaric tagged based quantitation coupled with TiO2 enrichment and offline prefractionation prior to nLC-MS/MS. However, the use of isobaric tags and offline HPLC limits the applicability of phosphoproteomics for the analysis of individual patient samples in real-time. To address these limitations, here we have optimized a new protocol, phospho-Heavy-labeled-spiketide FAIMS Stepped-CV DDA (pHASED). pHASED maintained phosphoproteomic coverage yet decreased sample preparation time and complexity by eliminating the variability associated with offline prefractionation. pHASED employed online phosphoproteome deconvolution using high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) and internal phosphopeptide standards to provide accurate label-free quantitation data. Compared with our traditional tandem mass tag (TMT) phosphoproteomics workflow and optimized using isogenic FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line models (n=18/workflow), pHASED halved total sample preparation, and running time (TMT=10 days, pHASED=5 days) and doubled the depth of phosphoproteomic coverage in real-time (phosphopeptides = 7,694 pHASED, 3,861 TMT). pHASED coupled with bioinformatic analysis predicted differential activation of the DNA damage and repair ATM signaling pathway in sorafenib-resistant AML cell line models, uncovering a potential therapeutic opportunity that was validated using cytotoxicity assays. Herein, we optimized a rapid, reproducible, and flexible protocol for the characterization of complex cancer phosphoproteomes in real-time, highlighting the potential for phosphoproteomics to aid in the improvement of clinical treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Human cancers often re-express germline factors, yet their mechanistic role in oncogenesis and cancer progression remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that DDX4, a germline factor and RNA helicase conserved in all multicellular organisms, contributes to epithelial mesenchyme transition (EMT)-like features and cisplatin resistance in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. DDX4 depletion in H69AR and SHP77 cell lines decreased motility and resistance to cisplatin, whereas its overexpression increased these features. Proteomic analysis suggests that DDX4 upregulates metabolic protein expression related to DNA repair and immune/inflammatory response, suggesting its fundamental function may be in regulating cellular metabolism. Consistent with these trends in cell lines, DDX4 depletion compromised in vivo tumor development while its overexpression enhanced tumor growth even after cisplatin treatment in nude mice. Although the DDX4 expression level in somatic tumors is generally low compared to that in the germline, the relatively higher DDX4 expression in SCLC patients correlates with decreased survival and shows increased expression of EMT and cisplatin resistance markers. Taken together, we conclude that DDX4 influences the survival of SCLC patients by altering cellular metabolism in response to environmental cues such as drug treatments. This fundamental function of DDX4 as a germline factor might be applicable in other cancer types that express DDX4 and may serve as a key to combat specific tumors that are highly resistant to treatments.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDDX4 contributes to cellular motility and drug resistance in SCLC cells.\nC_LIO_LIDDX4-overexpression globally alters the proteome and suppresses cytokine production.\nC_LIO_LIDDX4 promotes tumorigenesis and drug resistance in vitro and in vivo.\nC_LIO_LIDDX4 expression correlates with survival in SCLC patients and with immune/inflammatory response both in cell lines and patient samples.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use their noise to represent uncertainties about the activity of the post-synaptic neuron. To show this we utilize the free-energy principle (FEP), a well-established theoretical framework to describe the ability of organisms to self-organize and survive in uncertain environments. This principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral functions such as attention or foraging, to the dynamics of single microcircuits in the brain, suggesting that the FEP can be used to describe all levels of brain function. The synapse-centric account of the FEP that is pursued here, suggests that synapses form an internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics, being updated by a synaptic learning rule that resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. This approach entails that a synapse utilizes noisy processes like stochastic synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate their noise processes to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.",

    "abstract": "Animals that are moderately protein restricted respond to this dietary stress by increasing consumption of protein-containing foods. This is true in many species, including rodents. Rodent models of protein restriction have typically relied on only male subjects, and there are plausible reasons why female rodents may respond differently to dietary protein restriction. To address this gap in knowledge, the current experiments examined protein preference after two weeks on a 5% protein diet or 20% protein control diet, in male and female mice. We found that female mice, like male mice, increase consumption of 4% casein (protein) relative to 4% maltodextrin (carbohydrate) when presented with both simultaneously. Interestingly, this increased consumption was due to more bursts in females and more licks per burst in males, indicating possible differences in mechanism by which increased intake is achieved. Stage of the estrous cycle did not affect female responses. Moreover, we measured plasma FGF21 - a hormone induced by protein restriction and necessary for protein preference - in male and female mice. Here, we found no statistical differences between protein-restricted males, females in diestrus, or females in proestrus. In non-restricted mice FGF21 levels were low, but significantly higher in females in proestrus than females in diestrus or males. Overall, these experiments highlight the importance of including female subjects in studies of food choice and macronutrient restriction.\n\nHighlights- Protein-restricted male and female mice exhibit protein preference\n- Estrous cycle stage does not influence protein preference\n- Estrous cycle stage does not affect plasma FGF21 during protein restriction\n- Non-restricted females in proestrus have higher FGF21 than those in diestrus or males",

We used single-nuclei and single- cell RNA sequencing to characterize FAP heterogeneity in patients with fatty infiltration. We identified an MME+ FAP subpopulation which, based on ex vivo characterization as well as transplantation experiments, exhibits high adipogenic potential. MME+ FAPs are characterized by low activity of WNT, known to control adipogenic commitment, and are refractory to the inhibitory role of WNT activators. Using preclinical models for muscle damage versus fatty infiltration, we show that many MME+ FAPs undergo apoptosis during muscle regeneration and differentiate into adipocytes under pathological conditions, leading to their depletion. Finally, we utilized the varying fat infiltration levels in human hip muscles to show the depletion of MME+ FAPs in fatty infiltrated human muscle. Altogether, we have identified the dominant adipogenic FAP subpopulation in skeletal muscle.",

Adult downstream shell genes, such as those encoding extracellular matrix proteins and biomineralisation enzymes, were largely not expressed during shell development, and instead, a development-specific downstream gene repertoire was expressed. Upstream regulatory genes such as transcription factors and signalling molecules were conserved between developmental and adult shell secretion. Comparing heteroconchian transcriptomic data with recently reported pteriomorphian larval shell proteome data suggests that, despite being phenotypically more conserved, the downstream effectors constituting the larval shell \"tool-kit\" may be as diverse as that of adults.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThere is still no consensus as to how to select models in Bayesian phylogenetics, and more generally in applied Bayesian statistics. Bayes factors are often presented as the method of choice, yet other approaches have been proposed, such as cross-validation or information criteria. Each of these paradigms raises specific computational challenges, but they also differ in their statistical meaning, being motivated by different objectives: either testing hypotheses or finding the best-approximating model. These alternative goals entail different compromises, and as a result, Bayes factors, cross-validation and information criteria may be valid for addressing different questions. Here, the question of Bayesian model selection is revisited, with a focus on the problem of finding the best-approximating model. Several model selection approaches were re-implemented, numerically assessed and compared: Bayes factors, cross-validation (CV), in its different forms (k-fold or leave-one-out), and the widely applicable information criterion (wAIC), which is asymptotically equivalent to leave-one-out cross validation (LOO-CV). Using a combination of analytical results and empirical and simulation analyses, it is shown that Bayes factors are unduly conservative. In contrast, cross-validation represents a more adequate formalism for selecting the model returning the best approximation of the data-generating process and the most accurate estimates of the parameters of interest. Among alternative CV schemes, LOO-CV and its asymptotic equivalent represented by the wAIC, stand out as the best choices, conceptually and computationally, given that both can be simultaneously computed based on standard MCMC runs under the posterior distribution.",

    "abstract": "A disrupted equilibrium between IL-17A-producing CD4 T-cells (Th17) and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the pathobiology of Multiple sclerosis (MS). Gut bacteria help in maintaining immune homeostasis by regulating the balance between anti-inflammatory Tregs and pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. Although, both gut bacteria and Tregs can regulate Th17 cells, the impact of IL-17A on gut microbiota and Tregs is unclear. Utilizing HLA-DR3 transgenic mouse model of MS, we show that IL-17A deficiency (HLA-DR3.IL17A-/- mice) expands Treg-inducing gut bacteria such as Prevotella, Parabacteroides, and Bacteroides and consequently Tregs, resulting in a milder disease in an animal model of MS. Notably, IL-17A sufficient DR3 mice develop milder disease on cohousing with IL-17A-deficient mice, highlighting a dominant role for gut microbiota in inducing Treg and reducing disease severity. Further, we observed an enrichment of bacterial-specific Treg promoting short-chain-fatty-acid metabolic pathways and induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells in HLA-DR3.IL17A-/- mice. Thus, our study shows a novel role of IL-17A in immune homeostasis and inflammation through regulation of the gut microbiota-Treg axis which can be used for the development of gut bacteria as therapeutics for MS.\n\nSignificance of our workIL-17A a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is linked with pathobiology of multiple inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS) and regulated by both gut microbiota and regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs). However, the importance of IL-17A in the regulation of gut microbiota and Treg is unknown. Here we show that IL-17A can regulate Treg and disease phenotype by modulating gut microbiota and provide a novel mechanism by which immune-mediators such as IL-17A impact the gut microbiota to alter immune cell function and ultimately disease outcomes. Transfer of milder disease phenotype from IL-17A deficient mice to IL-17A sufficient mice on cohousing indicate a dominant role of gut microbiota in disease suppression. Thus, our study lays the foundation for future studies to unravel the interplay between immunological responses and the gut microbiota which will result in the development of microbiota-based therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Precise regulation of transcription initiation and elongation enables bacteria to control cellular responses to environmental stimuli. RNAseq is the most common tool for measuring the transcriptional output of bacteria, comprising predominantly mature transcripts. To gain further insight into transcriptional dynamics, it is necessary to discriminate actively transcribed loci from those represented in the total RNA pool. One solution is to capture RNA polymerase (RNAP) in the act of transcription, but current methods are restricted to culturable and genetically tractable organisms. Here, we apply precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) to profile nascent transcription, a method amenable to diverse species. We find that PRO-seq is well-suited to profile small, structured, or post-transcriptionally modified RNAs, which are often excluded from RNAseq libraries. When PRO-seq is applied to the human microbiome, we identify taxon-specific RNAP pause motifs. We also uncover concurrent transcription and cleavage of guide RNAs and tRNA fragments at active CRISPR and tRNA loci. We demonstrate the specific utility of PRO-seq as a tool for exploring transcriptional dynamics in diverse microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Although proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology that hijacking the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to artificially degrade protein is an emerging promising technology for many undruggable targets, it still faces several challenges, such as the difficulty to select high specificity molecule to protein of interest (POI), and only few of the E3-ligase are suitable for PROTAC mediated protein degradation. Protein-based PROTAC, termed BioPROTAC, owns the advantage of specificity but lacks membrane permeability. Here, we develop a new targeted protein degrading platform, which we termed RiboPROTAC, by encoding BioPROTAC protein degraders with circular mRNA (cmRNA) and delivering intracellularly. In this way, intracellular protein GFP and nuclear protein PCNA were successfully degraded. For PCNA targeting, not only the level of target protein is strongly decreased, but also the cell function related is strongly interfered, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, as well as the cell cycle. What is more, for the first time, we observed that degrading PCNA with RiboPROTAC causes immunogenic cell death (ICD), although not strong, but was verified in vivo. Importantly, our in vivo results demonstrated that cmRNA encoded PCNA degrader exhibited significant tumor suppression effect, thus we provide the first proof of concept for the application of RiboPROTAC as potential mRNA therapeutic. We consider that RiboPROTAC is a new and superior PROTAC technology for targeting the undruggable targets.",

    "abstract": "Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a debilitating genetic disorder with a wide range of severe symptoms including bone marrow failure and predisposition to cancer. CRISPR-Cas genome editing manipulates genotypes by harnessing DNA repair and has been proposed as a potential cure for FA. But FA is caused deficiencies in DNA repair itself, preventing the use of editing strategies such as homology directed repair. Recently developed base editing (BE) systems do not rely on double stranded DNA breaks and might be used to target mutations in FA genes, but this remains to be tested. Here we develop a proof of concept therapeutic base editing strategy to address two of the most prevalent FANCA mutations in patient cells. We find that optimizing adenine base editor construct, vector type, guide RNA format, and delivery conditions lead to very effective genetic modification in multiple FA patient backgrounds. Optimized base editing restored FANCA expression, molecular function of the FA pathway, and phenotypic resistance to crosslinking agents. ABE8e mediated editing in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from an FA patient was both genotypically effective and restored FA pathway function, indicating the potential of base editing strategies for future clinical application in FA.",

    "abstract": "The presence and impact of recessive lethal mutations has been widely documented in diploid outcrossing species. However, precise estimates in different species of the proportion of mutations that are recessive lethal remain limited. Here, we attempt to quantify the fraction of new mutations that are recessive lethal using Fit{partial}a{partial}i, a commonly-used method for inferring the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) using the site frequency spectrum. Using simulations, we demonstrate that Fit{partial}a{partial}i cannot accurately estimate the fraction of recessive lethal mutations, as expected given that Fit{partial}a{partial}i assumes that all mutations are additive by default. Consistent with the idea that mis-specification of the dominance model can explain this performance, we find that Fit{partial}a{partial}i can accurately infer the fraction of additive lethal mutations. Moreover, we demonstrate that in both additive and recessive cases, inference of the deleterious non-lethal portion of the DFE is minimally impacted by a small proportion (<10%) of lethal mutations. Finally, as an alternative approach to estimate the proportion of mutations that are recessive lethal, we employ models of mutation-selection-drift balance using existing genomic parameters and segregating recessive lethals estimates for humans and Drosophila melanogaster. In both species, we find that the segregating recessive lethal load can be explained by a very small fraction (<1%) of new nonsynonymous mutations being recessive lethal. Our results refute recent assertions of a much higher recessive lethal mutation fraction (4-5%), while highlighting the need for additional information on the joint distribution of selection and dominance coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Genetic background is a major driver of phenotypic variability in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Most studies of variation in PSCs have relied on transcript abundance as the primary molecular readout of cell state. However, little is known about how proteins, the primary functional units in the cell, vary across genetically diverse PSCs, how protein abundance relates to variation in other cell characteristics, and how genetic background confers these effects. Here we present a comprehensive genetic study characterizing the pluripotent proteome of 190 unique mouse embryonic stem cell lines (mESCs) derived from genetically heterogeneous Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. The quantitative proteome is highly variable across DO mESCs, and we identified differentially activated pluripotency-associated pathways in the proteomics data that were not evident in transcriptome data from the same cell lines. Comparisons of protein abundance to transcript levels and chromatin accessibility show broad co-variation across molecular layers and variable correlation across samples, with some lines showing high and others low correlation between these multi-omics datasets. Integration of these three molecular data types using multi-omics factor analysis revealed shared and unique drivers of quantitative variation in pluripotency-associated pathways. QTL mapping localized the genetic drivers of this quantitative variation to a number of genomic hotspots, and demonstrated that multi-omics data integration consolidates the influence of genetic signals shared across molecular traits to increase QTL detection power and overcome the limitations inherent in mapping individual molecular features. This study reveals transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms and genetic interactions that underlie quantitative variability in the pluripotent proteome, and in so doing provides a regulatory map for mouse ESCs that can provide a rational basis for future mechanistic studies, including studies of human PSCs.",

While its peroxisomal function is not known, in mitochondria ATAD1 is part of a quality control mechanism extracting mislocalised tail-anchored and accumulated precursor proteins from the outer membrane. Here, we studied the peroxisomal interactome of ATAD1 and could show that human ATAD1 interacts with PEX5, a cytosolic receptor for peroxisomal matrix proteins which transiently inserts into peroxisomal membranes. Upon cargo-release, mono-ubiquitinated PEX5 is recycled into the cytosol by the AAA-peroxins PEX1 and PEX6. The accumulation of ubiquitinated PEX5 is known to trigger degradation of whole organelles called pexophagy. Here, we used ATAD1-, PEX1- and ATAD1/PEX1-CRISPR-Knockout cell lines to investigate the physiological role of an ATAD1-PEX5 interaction. We could show an influence of ATAD1 on the stability of accumulated PEX5 and hypothesize a role in a peroxisomal quality control mechanism enabling clearance of ubiquitinated receptor from the membrane.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMillions of people worldwide are affected by clinical conditions that result in gait asymmetry (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, lower limb amputation). There is a need for customizable rehabilitation approaches that can flexibly target different aspects of gait asymmetry with minimal need for specialized equipment. Here, we studied how simple within-stride changes in treadmill speed could drive selective, predictable changes in human gait symmetry.\n\nMethodsIn Experiment 1, ten healthy young adults walked on an instrumented treadmill with and without a closed-loop controller engaged. The controller changed the treadmill speed to 1.50 m/s or 0.75 m/s depending on whether the right or left leg generated propulsive (i.e., forward-directed) ground reaction forces, respectively. In Experiment 2, a separate group of ten healthy young adults walked on the treadmill with and without an open-loop controller engaged. This controller changed the treadmill speed to 1.50 m/s or 0.75 at a prescribed time interval. We used a metronome to guide the participants to step at a series of different time points relative to the controller-driven speed change. We collected kinematic and kinetic data in Experiments 1 and 2.\n\nResultsIn Experiment 1, participants walked with asymmetric kinematics and ground reaction forces when the closed-loop controller was engaged. The leg that accelerated during propulsion (right leg) showed a smaller leading limb angle and a larger trailing limb angle than the leg that decelerated during propulsion (left leg). The right leg also generated smaller propulsive forces than the left leg. In Experiment 2, the patterns of asymmetry in spatiotemporal gait parameters, kinematics, and ground reaction forces depended on the timing of the speed change within the gait cycle. Step times, leading limb angles, and peak propulsion became asymmetric when the treadmill speed changed early in stance. When the treadmill speed changed later in stance, step lengths, step times, and propulsion impulses became asymmetric.\n\nConclusionsSimple manipulations of treadmill speed can drive predictable, selective changes in human gait symmetry. Future work will explore this customizable technique as a potential approach for restoring gait symmetry in clinical populations.",

Such assays often employ endpoint measurements of SNP or wild type (WT) activated Cas12 trans-cleavage activity; however, the fundamental kinetic effects of SNP versus WT activation remain unknown. We here show that endpoint-based assays are limited by arbitrary experimental choices (like used reporter concentration and assay duration) and work best for known target concentrations. More importantly, we show that SNP (versus WT) activation results in measurable shifts in the Cas12 trans-cleavage substrate affinity (KM) and apparent catalytic efficiency [Formula]. To address endpoint-based assay limitations, we then develop an assay based on the quantification of Michalis-Menten parameters and apply this assay to a 20-base pair WT target of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. We find that the [Formula] measured for WT is 130-fold greater than the lowest [Formula] among all 60 measured SNPs (compared to a 4.8-fold for endpoint fluorescence of the same SNP). KM also offers strong ability to distinguish SNPs, varies 27-fold over all the cases, and is insensitive to target concentration. Lastly, we point out trends among kinetic rates and SNP base and location within the CRISPR-Cas12 targeted region.",

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification that plays a central role in many cellular processes. With recent advances in biotechnology, thousands of phosphorylated sites can be identified and quantified in a given sample, enabling proteome-wide screening of cellular signaling. However, the kinase(s) that phosphorylate most (> 90%) of the identified phosphorylation sites are unknown. Knowledge of kinase-substrate associations is also mostly limited to a small number of well-studied kinases, with 20% of known kinases accounting for the phosphorylation of 87% of currently annotated sites. The scarcity of available annotations calls for the development of computational algorithms for more comprehensive and reliable prediction of kinase-substrate associations.\n\nResultsTo broadly utilize available structural, functional, evolutionary, and contextual information in predicting kinase-substrate associations, we develop a network-based machine learning framework. Our framework integrates a multitude of data sources to characterize the landscape of functional relationships and associations among phosphosites and kinases. To construct a phosphosite-phosphosite association network, we use sequence similarity, shared biological pathways, co-evolution, co-occurrence, and co-phosphorylation of phosphosites across different biological states. To construct a kinase-kinase association network, we integrate protein-protein interactions, shared biological pathways, and membership in common kinase families. We use node embeddings computed from these heterogeneous networks to train machine learning models for predicting kinase-substrate associations. Our systematic computational experiments using the PhosphositePLUS database shows that the resulting algorithm, NetKSA, outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and resources, including KinomeXplorer and LinkPhinder, in reliably predicting KSAs. By stratifying the ranking of kinases, NetKSA also enables annotation of phosphosites that are targeted by relatively less-studied kinases. Finally, we observe that the performance of NetKSA is robust to the choice of network embedding algorithms, while each type of network contributes valuable information that is complementary to the information provided by other networks.\n\nConclusionRepresentation of available functional information on kinases and phosphorylation sites, along with integrative machine learning algorithms, has the potential to significantly enhance our knowledge on kinase-substrate associations.\n\nAvailabilityThe code and data are available at compbio.case.edu/NetKSA.",

Here, we employ QM/MM string method simulations to determine the favored pathway of strigolactone hydrolysis and the nature of the covalent modification that acts as a promoter of strigolactone receptor activation. Our simulations show that strigolactone hydrolysis occurs via an acyl substitution pathway beginning with nucleophilic attack on the butenolide ring, which is well corroborated by previous experimental literature. Additionally, we show that multiple possible modes of covalent modifications to the catalytic residues by the butenolide ring are able to form and interconvert, reconciling several seemingly conflicting views on the hydrolysis-induced covalent modification to strigolactone receptors.",

    "abstract": "The oncogene cMYC (HGNC:7553) is a critical genomic target of the BRD4-NUT (B4N) protein that defines many of the NUTM1-rearrangement cancer subtypes in NUT carcinoma (NC). Previously, we reported that B4N interacts with the EP300 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT3B) and creates hyperacetylated \"megadomains\" that activate downstream genes such as cMYC. Here we ask how misregulated cMYC in turn interacts with protein partners and target genes in patient-derived NC797 cells, and whether these interactions change in response to B4N inactivation. We used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-in of a BioTAP affinity tag to analyze cMYC protein expressed from its normal chromosomal context. This allowed us to implement a crosslinking purification method termed BioTAP-XL to preserve cMYC integrity and chromatin association for genomic and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. We found that in the NC797 cell line, cMYC interacts primarily with the NuA4 KAT5 lysine acetyltransferase complex, with interactions that are maintained despite a decrease in cMYC levels after JQ1 treatment. We propose that a cascade of aberrant acetyltransferase activities in NC797 cells, first via EP300 recruitment by B4N to mis-regulate cMYC, and then by KAT5 interaction with the resulting overexpressed cMYC protein, drive NC cell proliferation and blockade to differentiation.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/489219v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82ec09org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1566d31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ab4dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57b741_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Simple SummaryA longstanding goal in biology is to understand how protein interactions influence and reflect cellular disease states. MYC is a critical regulator of cellular proliferation that is mis-regulated in many cancers, including those with NUTM1-rearrangements featured in this issue. NUT carcinoma cells are dependent on MYC expression, which blocks differentiation. Using a crosslinking approach to identify MYC protein interactions in a NUTM1-rearranged patient cell line, we found that MYC interacts primarily with subunits of the NuA4 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT5), one of two KAT complexes previously discovered as MYC interactors in non-NUTM1 cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by its fibrotic and stiff extracellular matrix (ECM); however, the role that altered cell-ECM signaling may play in driving PDAC phenotype has historically been difficult to dissect. Here, we design an engineered matrix that recapitulates key hallmarks of the tumor ECM and show that patient-derived PDAC organoids develop gemcitabine chemoresistance when cultured within high stiffness matrices mechanically matched to in vivo tumors. Using genetic barcoding, we find that while matrix-specific clonal selection occurs, cellular heterogeneity is not the main driver of chemoresistance. Instead, stiffness-induced chemoresistance occurs due to the development of a plastic cancer stem cell phenotype - mediated by hyaluronan mechanosignaling - with increased expression of drug efflux transporters. Moreover, PDAC chemoresistance is reversible following transfer from high to low stiffness matrices, suggesting that mechanotherapeutics targeting the fibrotic ECM may sensitize chemoresistant tumors. Overall, we demonstrate the power of engineered matrices and patient-derived organoids to elucidate how ECM properties influence human disease pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Polarization of cells prior to asymmetric cell division is crucial for correct cell divisions, cell fate and tissue patterning. In maize stomatal development, polarization of subsidiary mother cells prior to asymmetric division is controlled by the BRK-PAN-ROP pathway. Two catalytically inactive receptor-like kinases, PAN2 and PAN1, are required for correct division plane positioning. Proteins in the BRK-PAN-ROP pathway are polarized in subsidiary mother cells, with the polarization of each protein dependent on the previous one. As most of the known proteins in this pathway do not physically interact, possible interactors that might participate in the pathway are yet to be described. We identified WPR proteins as new players during subsidiary mother cell polarization. WPRs physically interact with PAN receptors, and polarly accumulate in subsidiary mother cells. The polarized localization of WPR proteins depends on PAN2 but not PAN1. CRISPR-Cas9- induced mutations result in division plane defects in subsidiary mother cells, and ectopic expression of WPR-RFP results in stomatal defects and alterations to the actin cytoskeleton. We show certain WPR proteins directly interact with F-actin through their N-terminus. Our data implicate WPR proteins as potentially regulating actin filaments, which providing insight into their molecular function. Together, these results demonstrate that WPR proteins are important for cell polarization.\n\nOne-sentence summaryFour related proteins, identified via their physical interaction with the receptor PAN2, are polarly localized prior to asymmetric division in stomatal lineage cells, and interact with F-actin.",

    "abstract": "Previous research shows that experimental sleep deprivation alters emotion processing, suggesting a potential mechanism linking sleep disruption to mental ill-health. Extending previous work, we experimentally disrupted sleep continuity in good sleepers and assessed next-day emotion processing and regulation using tasks with established sensitivity to depression. In a laboratory-based study, 51 good sleepers (37 female; mean age = 24 years, SD= 3.63) were randomized to one night (23:00-07:00) of uninterrupted sleep (n=24) or sleep continuity disruption (n=27). We assessed emotion perception, attention, and memory the following day. Participants also completed an emotion regulation task and measures of self-reported affect, anxiety, sleepiness, overnight declarative memory consolidation, and psychomotor vigilance. Confirming the effects of the manipulation, sleep continuity disruption led to a marked decrease in polysomnography-defined total sleep time (229.98 mins vs 434.57 mins), increased wake-time after sleep onset (260.66 mins vs 23.84 mins) and increased sleepiness (d=0.81). Sleep continuity disruption led to increased anxiety (d=0.68), decreased positive affect (d=-0.62), reduced overnight declarative memory consolidation (d=-1.08) and reduced psychomotor vigilance [longer reaction times (d=0.64) and more lapses (d=0.74)], relative to control. However, contrary to our hypotheses, experimental sleep disruption had no effect on perception of, or bias for, emotional facial expressions, emotional memory for words, or emotion regulation following worry induction. In conclusion, one night of sleep continuity disruption had no appreciable effect on objective measures of emotion processing or emotion regulation in response to worry induction, despite clear effects on memory consolidation, vigilance, and self-reported affect and anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Increased long-chain C20:0 ceramides have been found in the serum of patients with depression. Moreover, ceramides are linked with increased microglia reactivity and inflammatory cytokine production, which are associated with depression. Since ceramides can readily cross the blood brain barrier, peripheral C20:0 ceramides could enter the brain, activate microglia, and induce depressive-like behavior. In this study, we determined whether localized infusion of C20:0 ceramides into the ventral hippocampus (VH) of rats is sufficient to activate microglia and induce depressive-like behaviors. Adult male and female rats received infusions of C20:0 ceramides or vehicle solution every other day for 2 weeks. After the third infusion, C20:0-infused animals showed reduced sucrose preference suggesting anhedonia-like behavior. However, 4-6 days after the last infusion, animals infused with C20:0 ceramides did not show anhedonia-like or despair-like behavior suggesting the behavioral effect was reversible. After the final behavioral test, C20:0-infused animals had more Iba-1+ microglia in the VH. Despite the increased number of VH microglia, the expression of inflammatory genes was not increased. In conclusion, our data suggest that localized increases in C20:0 ceramides in the VH are sufficient to induce microglia activation and reversible anhedonia-like behavior.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDCocaine epigenetically regulates gene expression via changes in histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs). We previously found that the immediate early gene Nr4a1 is epigenetically activated by cocaine in mouse brain reward regions. HPTMs act combinatorically, yet few studies examine multiple HPTMs at a single gene. Bivalent gene promoters are simultaneously enriched in both activating (H3K4me3 (K4)) and repressive (H3K27me3 (K27)) HPTMs. As such, bivalent genes are lowly expressed but poised for activity-dependent gene regulation. In the current study, we defined regulation of K4&K27 bivalency at Nr4a1 following cocaine treatment in male and female mice. The inclusion of female mice can shed light on the epidemiological relevance of sex to cocaine use disorder.\n\nMETHODSMale and female mice were injected with saline or cocaine (i.p. 20mg/kg). We applied sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR to define Nr4a1 bivalency and expression in striatum (STR), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus (HPC). Pearsons correlation matrices quantified relationships within each brain region across treatment conditions for each sex.\n\nRESULTSWe defined K4&K27 bivalency at the Nr4a1 promoter in all three brain regions, in both sexes. In female STR, cocaine increased Nr4a1 mRNA, coupled to maintenance of Nr4a1 K4&K27 bivalency. In male STR, cocaine enriched repressive H3K27me3 and K4&K27 bivalency at Nr4a1 and failed to increase Nr4a1 mRNA. Furthermore, cocaine epigenetically regulated a putative NR4A1 target, Cartpt, in male PFC.\n\nCONCLUSIONThis study defined the epigenetic regulation of Nr4a1 in reward brain regions in male and female mice. Cocaine treatment in female mice increased Nr4a1 mRNA in STR, but there was no change in Nr4a1 H3K27me3 or K4&K27 promoter bivalency. Following cocaine treatment in male mice, Nr4a1 mRNA did not change in STR, HPC, or PFC, and Nr4a1 H3K27me3 and K4&K27 promoter bivalency increased in the STR.",

    "abstract": "Listening can be conceptualized as a process of active inference, in which the brain forms internal models to predict and integrate auditory information in a complex interaction of bottom-up and top-down processes. Whether inter-individual \"prediction tendencies\" shape listening experiences of real-world stimuli such as speech is, however, unknown. In the current study, we used a passive paradigm presenting tone sequences of varying entropy level, to independently quantify auditory prediction tendency (as the tendency to anticipate low-level acoustic features according to their contextual probability) for each individual. This measure was then used to predict the magnitude of cortical speech (envelope) tracking in a multi speaker listening task, where participants listened to audiobooks narrated by a target speaker in isolation or interfered by 1 or 2 distractors. Furthermore, rare semantic violations were introduced into the story, enabling us to also examine effects of word surprisal during continuous speech processing. Our results show that individual prediction tendency facilitates cortical speech tracking. Furthermore, we find interactions between individual prediction tendency and background noise as well as word surprisal in disparate brain regions. In sum, our findings suggest that individual prediction tendencies are generalizable across different listening situations and may serve as a valuable element to explain interindividual differences in natural listening experience.",

    "abstract": "Our recent single cell sequencing of most adult Drosophila circadian neurons indicated striking gene expression heterogeneity, about 2-3 cells per clock neuron group. To extend this characterization to other adult fly brain neurons, we used the identical plate-based methods to generate single cell data from a similar subset of dopaminergic neurons. To minimize batch effects and to apply an additional sequencing strategy, we also assayed these two populations together with 10X Chromium. An unsupervised clustering algorithm indicates that dopaminergic neurons are comparably heterogeneous, suggesting that the transcriptomic diversity of adult fly brain neurons parallels its EM connectome. The results here further indicate that connectivity molecules like cell surface molecules best characterize all neuron groups. We suggest that these surprising features are general and make major contributions to neuronal identity and connectivity of the adult central brain as well as underlie the complex behavioral repertoire of Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Melioidosis is a disease caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bpm), commonly found in soil and water of endemic areas. Naturally acquired human melioidosis infections can result from either exposure through percutaneous inoculation, inhalation, or ingestion of soil-contaminated food or water. Our prior studies recognized Bpm as an effective enteric pathogen, capable of establishing acute or chronic gastrointestinal infections following oral inoculation. However, the specific mechanisms and virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of Bpm during intestinal infection are unknown. In our current study, we standardized an in vitro intestinal infection model using primary intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and demonstrated that Bpm requires a functional T6SS for full virulence. Further, we performed dual RNA-seq analysis on Bpm-infected IECs to evaluate differentially expressed host and bacterial genes in the presence or absence of a T6SS. Our results showed a dysregulation in the TNF- signaling via NF-{kappa}B pathway in the absence of the T6SS, with some of the genes involved in inflammatory processes and cell death also affected. Analysis of the bacterial transcriptome identified virulence factors and regulatory proteins playing a role during infection, with association to the T6SS. By using a Bpm transposon mutant library and isogenic mutants, we showed that deletion of the bicA gene, encoding a putative T3SS/T6SS regulator, ablated intracellular survival and plaque formation by Bpm and impacted survival and virulence when using murine models of acute and chronic gastrointestinal infection. Overall, these results highlight the importance of the type 6 secretion system in the gastrointestinal pathogenesis of Bpm.",

    "abstract": "During community ambulation, anticipatory adaptations in gait are key for navigating built, populated and natural environments. It has been argued that some instability in gait can be functionally beneficial in situations demanding high maneuverability, and while the mechanisms utilized to maintain locomotor balance are well understood, relatively less is known about how the control of gait stability changes to facilitate upcoming maneuvers in challenging environments. The double support phase may be important in this regard; since both feet can push off the ground simultaneously, there is greater control authority over the bodys movement during this phase. Our goal was to identify how this control authority is exploited to prepare for upcoming maneuvers in challenging environments. We used synergy indices to quantify the degree of coordination between the ground reaction forces and moments under the two feet for stabilizing the resultant force and moment on the body during the double support phase of curb descent. In contrast to our expectations, we observed that the kinetic synergy indices during curb descent were minimally influenced by expected foot targeting maneuvers for the subsequent step. Only the resultant moment in the frontal plane showed reduced stability when targeting was required, but the synergy index was still high, indicating that the resultant moment was stable. Furthermore, the synergy indices indicated that the main function of the ground reaction variables is to maintain stability of whole-body rotations during double support, and this prerogative was minimally influenced by the subsequent foot targeting tasks, likely because the cost of losing balance while descending a curb would be higher than the cost of mis-stepping on a visual target. Our work demonstrates the salience of stabilizing body rotations during curb negotiation and improves our understanding of locomotor control in challenging environments.",

Almost all of the birds are shot using shotgun pellets composed principally of lead (Pb). Lead shotgun pellets often fragment on impact within the bodies of gamebirds, leaving small lead particles in the meat that are difficult for consumers to detect and remove and from which a greater proportion of lead is likely to be absorbed. Chronic exposure to even low levels of lead is associated with negative health effects in humans and especially in groups particularly vulnerable to the effects of lead, which include young children and pregnant women. Our study used a high-resolution computerised tomography X-ray scanner to locate, in three dimensions, metal fragments embedded within carcasses of eight pheasants sold for human consumption in the UK. Small radio-dense fragments (<2 mm diameter), assumed to be metallic lead, were present in all of the pheasant carcasses examined (mean number: 39 per carcass) and many were too small (<0.1 mm diameter) and too distant from the nearest large shotgun pellet for it to be practical for consumers to detect and remove them without discarding a large proportion of otherwise usable meat. Consumers of carcasses of pheasants killed using lead shotgun ammunition are likely to be exposed to elevated levels of dietary lead, even if careful food preparation is practiced to remove shotgun pellets and the most damaged tissue.",

    "abstract": "Body-size scaling of metabolic rate in animals is typically allometric, with mass exponents that vary to reflect differences in the physiological status of organisms of both endogenous and environmental origin. Regarding the intraspecific analysis of this relationship in bivalve molluscs, one important source of metabolic variation comes from the large inter-individual differences in growth performance characteristic of this group. In the present study, we aimed to address the association of growth rate differences recorded among individual mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) with variable levels of the standard metabolic rate (SMR) resulting in growth-dependent shift in size scaling relationships. SMR was measured in mussels of different sizes and allometric functions fitting SMR vs. body-mass relationships were compared both inter- and intra-individually. The results revealed a metabolic component (the overhead of growth) attributable to the differential costs of maintenance of feeding and digestion structures between fast and slow growers; these costs were estimated to amount to a 3% increase in SMR per unit of increment in the weight specific growth rate. Scaling exponents computed for intraindividual SMR vs body-mass relationships had a common value b = 0.79 (~ [3/4]); however, when metabolic effects caused by differential growth were discounted, this value declined to 0.67 (= [2/3]), characteristic of surface dependent processes. This last value of the scaling exponent was also recorded for the interindividual relationships of both SMR and RMR after long-lasting maintenance of mussels under optimal uniform conditions in the laboratory. The above results were interpreted based on the metabolic level boundary (MLB) hypothesis.",
