    "abstract": "Recent studies showed that task demand affects object representations in higher-level visual areas and beyond, but not so much in earlier areas. There are, however, limitations in those studies including the relatively weak manipulation of task due to the use of familiar real-life objects, the low temporal resolution in fMRI, and the emphasis on the amount and not the source of information carried by brain activations. In the current study, observers categorized images of artificial objects in one of two orthogonal dimensions, shape and texture, while their brain activity was recorded with electroencephalogram (EEG). Results showed that object processing along the texture dimension was affected by task demand starting from a relatively late time (320-370ms time window) after image onset. The findings are consistent with the view that task exerts an effect on the later phases of object processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptome profiling has been pivotal in better comprehending the convoluted biology of tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Recently, growing evidence has implicated the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2 or MK2) in many human diseases including tumors. MK2 has been recently reported as a critical regulator of HNSCC that functions via modulating the transcript turnover of crucial genes involved in its pathogenesis. Comprehensive MK2-centric transcriptomic analyses could help the scientific community to delve deeper into MK2-pathway driven mechanisms of tumor progression, but such studies have not yet been reported. Consequently, to delineate the biological relevance of MK2 and its intricate crosstalk in the tumor milieu, an extensive transcriptome analysis of HNSCC was conceptualized and effectuated with MK2 at the nexus.\n\nMethodsIn the current study, comprehensive next-generation sequencing-based transcriptome profiling was accomplished to ascertain global patterns of mRNA expression profiles in both in vitro and in vivo models of the HNSCC microenvironment. The findings of the RNA-sequencing analysis were cross-validated via robust validation using nCounter gene expression assays, immunohistochemistry, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).\n\nResultsTranscriptomic characterization followed by annotation and differential gene expression analyses identified certain MK2-regulated candidate genes constitutively involved in regulating HNSCC pathogenesis, and the biological significance of these genes was established by pathway enrichment analysis. Additionally, advanced gene expression assays through the nCounter system in conjunction with immunohistochemical analysis validated the transcriptome profiling outcomes quite robustly. Furthermore, the results obtained from immunohistochemistry and transcript stability analysis indicated the crucial role of MK2 in the modulation of the expression pattern of these genes in HNSCC tumors and cells.\n\nConclusionsConclusively, the findings have paved the way toward the identification of new effective tumor markers and potential molecular targets for HNSCC management. The results have accentuated the importance of certain differentially expressed MK2-regulated genes that are constitutively involved in HNSCC pathogenesis to potentially serve as putative candidates for future endeavors pertaining to diagnosis and therapeutic interventions for HNSCC.",

    "abstract": "Accurate inference of population structure is important in many studies of population genetics. Here we present, HaploNet, a method for performing dimensionality reduction and clustering of genetic data. The method is based on local clustering of phased haplotypes using neural networks from whole-genome sequencing or dense genotype data. By utilizing Gaussian mixtures in a variational autoencoder framework, we are able to learn a low-dimensional latent space in which we cluster haplotypes along the genome in a highly scalable manner. We demonstrate that we can use haplotype clusters in the latent space to infer global population structure utilizing haplotype information by exploiting the generative properties of our framework. Based on fitted neural networks and its latent haplotype clusters, we can perform principal component analysis and estimate ancestry proportions based on a maximum likelihood framework. Using sequencing data from simulations and closely related human populations, we demonstrate that our approach is better at distinguishing closely related populations than standard admixture and principal component analysis software. We further show that HaploNet is fast and highly scalable by applying it to genotype array data of the UK Biobank.",

    "abstract": "Plants and algae are faced with a conundrum: harvesting sufficient light to drive their metabolic needs while dissipating light in excess to prevent photodamage, a process known as non-photochemical quenching. A slowly relaxing form of energy dissipation, termed qH, is critical for plants survival under abiotic stress. Here, we tested whether we could isolate photosynthetic subcomplexes (from plants in which qH was induced) that would remain in an energy-dissipative state. Interestingly chlorophyll fluorescence lifetimes were decreased by qH in isolated major trimeric antenna complexes, providing a natively quenched complex with physiological relevance to natural conditions. Next, we monitored the changes in thylakoid pigment, protein or lipid content of antenna with active or inactive qH, and no evident differences were detected. Finally, we investigated whether specific antenna subunits of the major antenna were required for qH but found it insensitive to trimer composition. Because qH can occur in the absence of specific xanthophylls, and no changes in pigments were detected, we propose that the energy-dissipative state reported here may stem from chlorophyll-chlorophyll excitonic interaction.",

    "abstract": "During navigation, information at multiple scales needs to be integrated. Single- unit recordings in rodents suggest that gradients of temporal dynamics in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support this integration. In humans, gradients of representation are observed, such that granularity of information represented increases along the long axis of the hippocampus. The neural underpinnings of this gradient in humans, however, are still unknown. Current research is limited by coarse fMRI analysis techniques that obscure the activity of individual voxels, preventing investigation of how moment-to-moment changes in brain signal are organized and how they are related to behavior. Here, we measured the signal stability of single voxels over time to uncover previously unappreciated gradients of temporal dynamics in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Using our novel, single voxel autocorrelation technique, we show a medial-lateral hippocampal gradient, as well as a continuous autocorrelation gradient along the anterolateral- posteromedial entorhinal extent. Importantly, we show that autocorrelation in the anterior-medial hippocampus was modulated by navigational difficulty, providing the first evidence that changes in signal stability in single voxels are relevant for behavior. This work opens the door for future research on how temporal gradients within these structures support the integration of information for goal- directed behavior.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial ATP synthase forms stable dimers arranged into oligomeric assemblies that generate the inner-membrane curvature essential for efficient energy conversion. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the intact ATP synthase dimer from Trypanosoma brucei in ten different rotational states. The model consists of 25 subunits, including nine lineage-specific, as well as 36 lipids. The rotary mechanism is influenced by the divergent peripheral stalk, conferring a greater conformational flexibility. Proton transfer in the lumenal half-channel occurs via a chain of five ordered water molecules. The dimerization interface is formed by subunit-g that is critical for interactions but not for the catalytic activity. Although overall dimer architecture varies among eukaryotes, we find that subunit-g together with subunit-e form an ancestral oligomerization motif, which is shared between the trypanosomal and mammalian lineages. Therefore, our data defines the subunit-g/e module as a structural component determining ATP synthase oligomeric assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Subject motion during fMRI can affect our ability to accurately measure signals of interest. In recent years, frame censoring--that is, statistically excluding motion-contaminated data within the general linear model using nuisance regressors--has appeared in several task-based fMRI studies as a mitigation strategy. However, there have been few systematic investigations quantifying its efficacy. In the present study, we compared the performance of frame censoring to several other common motion correction approaches for task-based fMRI using open data and reproducible workflows. We analyzed eight publicly-available datasets representing eleven distinct tasks in child, adolescent, and adult participants. Performance was quantified using maximum t-values in group analyses, and ROI-based mean activation and split-half reliability in single subjects. We compared frame censoring across several thresholds to the use of 6 and 24 canonical motion regressors, wavelet despiking, robust weighted least squares, and untrained ICA-based denoising, for a total of 240 separate analyses. Thresholds used to identify censored frames were based on both motion estimates (FD) and image intensity changes (DVARS). Relative to standard motion regressors, we found consistent improvements for modest amounts of frame censoring (e.g., 1-2% data loss), although these gains were frequently comparable to what could be achieved using other techniques. Importantly, no single approach consistently outperformed the others across all datasets and tasks. These findings suggest that the choice of a motion mitigation strategy depends on both the dataset and the outcome metric of interest.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell omics technologies enable the individual and joint profiling of cellular measurements. Currently, most single-cell analysis pipelines are cluster-centric and cannot explicitly model the interactions between different feature types. In addition, single-cell methods are generally designed for a particular task as distinct single-cell problems are formulated differently. To address these current shortcomings, we present SIMBA, a graph embedding method that jointly embeds single cells and their defining features, such as genes, chromatin accessible regions, and transcription factor binding sequences into a common latent space. By leveraging the co-embedding of cells and features, SIMBA allows for the study of cellular heterogeneity, clustering-free marker discovery, gene regulation inference, batch effect removal, and omics data integration. SIMBA has been extensively applied to scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and dual-omics data. We show that SIMBA provides a single framework that allows diverse single-cell analysis problems to be formulated in a unified way and thus simplifies the development of new analyses and integration of other single-cell modalities. SIMBA is implemented as an efficient, comprehensive, and extensible Python library (https://simba-bio.readthedocs.io) for the analysis of single-cell omics data using graph embedding.",

However, despite representing one of the largest classes of therapeutic targets, most inactive-state G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have remained inaccessible for cryo-EM because their small size and membrane-embedded nature impedes projection alignment for high-resolution map reconstructions. Here we demonstrate that the same single-chain camelid antibody (nanobody) recognizing a grafted intracellular loop can be used to obtain cryo-EM structures of different inactive-state GPCRs at resolutions comparable or better than those obtained by X-ray crystallography. Using this approach, we obtained the structure of human neurotensin 1 receptor (NTSR1) bound to antagonist SR48692, of {micro}-opioid receptor (MOR) bound to the clinical antagonist alvimopan, as well as the structures of the previously uncharacterized somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) in the apo state and histamine receptor 2 (H2R) bound to the H2 blocker famotidine. Each of these structures yields novel insights into ligand binding and specificity.

    "abstract": "Btg3-associated nuclear protein (Banp) was originally identified as a nuclear matrix-associated region (MAR)-binding protein and it functions as a tumor suppressor. At the molecular level, Banp regulates transcription of metabolic genes via a CGCG-containing motif called the Banp motif. However, its physiological roles in embryonic development are unknown. Here we report that Banp is indispensable for the DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Zebrafish banp mutants show mitotic cell accumulation and apoptosis in developing retina. We found that DNA replication stress and tp53-dependent DNA damage responses were activated to induce apoptosis in banp mutants, suggesting that Banp is required for regulation of DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Furthermore, consistent with mitotic cell accumulation, chromosome segregation was not smoothly processed from prometaphase to anaphase in banp morphants, leading to a prolonged M-phase. Our RNA- and ATAC-sequencing identified 31 candidates for direct Banp target genes that carry the Banp motif. Interestingly, a DNA replication fork regulator, wrnip1, and two chromosome segregation regulators, cenpt and ncapg, are included in this list. Thus, Banp directly regulates transcription of wrnip1 for recovery from DNA replication stress, and cenpt and ncapg for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence that Banp is required for cell-cycle progression and cell survival by regulating DNA damage responses and chromosome segregation during mitosis.",

Harnessing in-scanner interleaved TMS/functional MRI (fMRI), we reveal that vlPFC neurostimulation evoked acute, dose-dependent modulations of amygdala fMRI BOLD signal. Larger TMS-evoked changes in amygdala fMRI signal were associated with higher fiber density in a vlPFC-amygdala white matter pathway, suggesting this pathway facilitated stimulation-induced communication between cortex and subcortex. This work provides evidence of amygdala engagement by TMS, highlighting stimulation of vlPFC-amygdala circuits as a candidate treatment for affective psychopathology. More broadly, it indicates that targeting cortical-subcortical connections may enhance the impact of TMS on subcortical neural activity and, by extension, subcortex-subserved behaviors.\n\nTeaserIndividualized, connectivity-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation modulates the amygdala, demonstrating therapeutic potential.",

Through quantitative tracing of clonal expansion of individual mutant cells, we revealed that only a rare primitive subset enriched in the distal fallopian tube is capable of clonal expansion whereas others stall immediately upon acquiring oncogenic mutations. Expanded clones from this subset then encountered further attrition: many stalled shortly after while others sustained small cluster of proliferative cells and biased differentiation toward primitive fate.

Here, we found that Sgg upregulates the expression of several types of collagens in HT29 and HCT116 cells, with type VI collagen (ColVI) being the highest upregulated collagen type. Knockdown of ColVI abolished the ability of Sgg to induce cell proliferation and reduced the adherence of Sgg to CRC cells. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important regulator of cell proliferation. Therefore, we further examined the role of decellularized matrix (dc-matrix), which is free of live bacteria or cells, in Sgg-induced cell proliferation. Dc-matrix prepared from Sgg-treated cells showed a significantly higher pro-proliferative activity than that from untreated cells or cells treated with the control bacteria. On the other hand, dc-matrix from Sgg-treated ColVI knockdown cells showed no difference in the capacity to support cell proliferation compared to that from untreated ColVI knockdown cells, suggesting that the ECM by itself is a mediator of Sgg-induced cell proliferation. Furthermore, Sgg-treated CRC cells formed significantly larger tumors in vivo, whereas Sgg treatment had no effect on ColVI knockdown cells, suggesting that ColVI is important for Sgg to promote tumor growth in vivo. These results highlight a dynamic bidirectional interplay between Sgg and the ECM, where Sgg upregulates collagen expression. The Sgg-modified ECM in turn affects the ability of Sgg to adhere to host cells and more importantly, acts as a mediator for Sgg-induced CRC cell proliferation. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism in which Sgg stimulates CRC proliferation through modulation of the ECM.\n\nAuthor SummaryColorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death. The development of CRC can be strongly influenced by specific gut microbes. Understanding how gut microbes modulate CRC is critical to developing novel strategies to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment of this disease. S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) has a strong clinical association with CRC and actively promotes the development of colon tumors. However, the mechanisms Sgg utilizes to promote tumors are not well understood. Our results showed for the first time a dynamic interplay between Sgg and the extracellular matrix. We found that Sgg upregulates the expression of collagens which in turn affects the interaction between Sgg and CRC cells and mediates CRC cell proliferation. These findings draw attention to a previously unrecognized dynamic bidirectional interplay between a CRC-associated microbe and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Given the importance of the ECM in normal homeostasis and in tumor microenvironment, these findings have important implications in the context of microbial contribution to cancer.",

    "abstract": "SummarySince the inception of single-cell level measuring techniques, identification of distinct cell stages, phenotypes and populations has been a challenge. Cell clustering and dimensionality reduction methods are the most popular approaches to identify heterogeneity of single-cell data. But, as public repositories continue to grow in number, integrative analyses and merging of large pools of samples from different and heterogeneous datasets becomes a difficult challenge, which showcases the impossibility of scalability of some of the existing methods. Here we present ClusterFoldSimilarity, an R package that calculates a measure of similarity between clusters from different datasets/batches, without the need of correcting for batch effect or normalizing and merging the data, thus avoiding artifacts and the loss of information derived from these kinds of techniques. The similarity metric is based on the average vector module and sign of the product of logarithmic fold-changes. ClusterFoldSimilarity compares every single pair of clusters from any number of different samples/datasets, including different number of clusters for each sample. Additionally, the algorithm is able to select the top genes which contribute the most to the similarity of two specific clusters, serving also as a feature selection tool.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe algorithm is freely available as an R package at: https://github.com/OscarGVelasco/ClusterFoldSimilarity\n\nContactoscargvelasco@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is commonly diagnosed in its late stages, and new treatment modalities are needed to improve patient outcomes and survival. We have recently established the synergistic effects of combination tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and procaspase activating compound (PAC-1) therapies in granulosa cell tumours (GCT) of the ovary, a rare form of ovarian cancer, using a mathematical model of the effects of both drugs in a GCT cell line. Here, to understand the mechanisms of combined TRAIL and PAC-1 therapy, study the viability of this treatment strategy, and accelerate preclinical translation, we leveraged our mathematical model in combination with population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) models of both TRAIL and PAC-1 to expand a realistic heterogeneous cohort of virtual patients and optimize treatment schedules. Using this approach, we investigated treatment responses in this virtual cohort and determined optimal therapeutic schedules based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic characteristics. Our results showed that schedules with high initial doses of PAC-1 were required for therapeutic efficacy. Further analysis of individualized regimens revealed two distinct groups of virtual patients within our cohort: one with high PAC-1 elimination, and one with normal PAC-1 elimination. In the high elimination group, high weekly doses of both PAC-1 and TRAIL were necessary for therapeutic efficacy, however virtual patients in this group were predicted to have a worse prognosis when compared to those in the normal elimination group. Thus, PAC-1 pharmacokinetic characteristics, particularly clearance, can be used to identify patients most likely to respond to combined PAC-1 and TRAIL therapy. This work underlines the importance of quantitative approaches in preclinical oncology.",

This phenomenon was initially discovered in a bacterial swarm where the linked phenotypes of high efflux and high mutation frequencies spatially segregated to the swarm edge, driven there by motility. We uncovered and validated a global regulatory network that connects high efflux to downregulation of specific DNA repair pathways even in non-swarming states. The efflux-DNA repair link was corroborated in a clinical  resistome database: genomes with mutations that increase efflux exhibit a significant increase in ARMs. Accordingly, efflux inhibitors decreased evolvability to antibiotic resistance. Swarms also revealed how bacterial populations serve as reservoir of ARMs even in absence of antibiotic selection pressure. High efflux at the edge births mutants that, despite compromised fitness, survive there because of reduced competition. This finding is relevant to biofilms where efflux activity is high.",

    "abstract": "Disease molecular complexity requires high throughput workflows to map disease pathways through analysis of vast tissue repositories. Great progress has been made in life sciences analytical technologies. To match the high throughput of these advanced analytical platforms, we have previously developed a multipurpose microplate sonicator, PIXUL, that can be used in multiple workflows to extract analytes from cultured cells and tissue fragments for various downstream molecular assays. And yet, the sample preparation devices, such as PIXUL, along with the downstream analytical capabilities have not been fully exploited to interrogate tissues because storing and sampling of such specimens remain, in comparison, inefficient. To mitigate this bottleneck, we have developed a low-cost user-friendly system, the CryoGrid, that consists of CryoBlock, thermometer/thermocouple, and QR coded CryoTrays to freeze and store frozen tissue fragments, and hand-held CryoCore tool for tissue sampling supported by iPad and Google apps to display tissues, direct coring and share metadata.\n\nRNA is one of the most studied analytes. There is a decades-long history of developing methods to isolate and analyze RNA. Still, the throughput of sampling and RNA extraction from tissues has not matched that of the high throughput transcriptome analytical platforms. To address this need, we have integrated the CryoGrid system with PIXUL-based methods to isolate RNA for gene-specific qPCR and genome-wide transcript analyses. TRIzol is commonly used to isolate RNA but it is labor-intensive, hazardous, requires fume-hoods, and is an expensive reagent. We developed a PIXUL-based TRIzol-free RNA isolation fast protocol that uses a buffer containing proteinase K (PK). Virtually every disease (and often therapeutic agents toxicity) is a systemic syndrome but often only one organ is examined. CryoGrid-PIXUL, integrated with either TRIzol or PK buffer RNA isolation protocols, yielded similar RNA profiles in a multiorgan (brain, heart, kidney and liver) mouse model of sepsis. Thus, RNA isolation using the CryoGrid-PIXUL system combined with the PK buffer offers an inexpensive user-friendly workflow to study transcriptional responses in tissues in health and disease as well as in therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Song acquisition and production in songbirds is governed by a dedicated neural circuitry that involves two parallel pathways: a motor pathway for the production and a basal ganglia (BG) pathway for the acquisition. Juveniles learn by imitating adult vocalizations and proceed by trial and error, errors being conveyed by a dopaminergic signal. The complex nature of the relationship between neural control and syrinx musculature makes song learning a complicated problem to solve. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely hypothesized to underlie such sensorimotor learning even though this can lead to sub-optimal solutions under uneven contours in continuous action spaces. In this article, we propose to re-interpret the role of a dual pathway architecture, underlying avian vocal learning, that helps overcome these limitations. We posit that the BG pathway conducts exploration by inducing large daily shifts in the vocal production while the motor pathway gradually consolidates this exploration. This process can be understood as a modified form of a simulated annealing process. Simulations on Gaussian performance landscapes and a syrinx-based performance landscape are demonstrated and compared with standard approaches. Taking behavioral constraints into account (60 days of learning, 1000 trials per day), the model allows to reach the global optimum in complex landscapes and thus provides a sound insight into the role of the dual pathway architecture underlying vocal learning.",

    "abstract": "SummaryStudies of associative learning have commonly focused on how rewarding outcomes are predicted by either sensory stimuli or animals actions. However, in many learning scenarios, reward delivery requires the occurrence of both sensory stimuli and animals actions in a specific order, in the form of behavioral sequences. How such behavioral sequences are learned is much less understood. Here we provide behavioral and neurophysiological evidence to show that behavioral sequences are learned using a stepwise strategy. In rats learning a new association, learning started from the behavioral event closest to the reward and sequentially incorporated earlier events. This led to the sequential refinement of reward-seeking behaviors, which was characterized by the stepwise elimination of ineffective and non-rewarded behavioral sequences. At the neuronal level, this stepwise learning process was mirrored by the sequential emergence of basal forebrain neuronal responses toward each event, which quantitatively conveyed a reward prediction error signal and promoted reward-seeking behaviors. Together, these behavioral and neural signatures revealed how behavioral sequences were learned in discrete steps and when each learning step took place.",

We previously identified mutations in sphingomyelin synthase SMS2 that cause osteoporosis and skeletal dysplasia. Here we show that SMS2 variants linked to the most severe bone phenotypes retain full enzymatic activity but fail to leave the ER owing to a defective autonomous ER export signal. Cells harboring pathogenic SMS2 variants accumulate sphingomyelin in the ER and display a disrupted transbilayer sphingomyelin asymmetry. These aberrant sphingomyelin distributions also occur in patient-derived fibroblasts and are accompanied by imbalances in cholesterol organization, glycerophospholipid profiles and lipid order in the secretory pathway. We postulate that pathogenic SMS2 variants undermine the capacity of osteogenic cells to uphold nonrandom lipid distributions that are critical for their bone forming activity.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic anaphase onset is a key cellular process that is tightly regulated by multiple kinases. The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in this process has been established long ago in Xenopus egg extracts. However, despite its importance, it is still unclear which MAPK(s) is actually involved, this impedes the further understanding of the regulatory cascade. In this study, we first demonstrated that the involvement of MAPKs in mitotic anaphase onset regulation is evolutionarily conserved in the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Then, we found that two of the three fission yeast MAPK signaling pathways act in concert to restrain anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The first pathway involves the phosphorylation of Mad2, a component of the core mitotic check complex (MCC), by MAPK Sty1, which enhances the tight binding of MCC to APC/C. The second pathway involves MAPK Pmk1 phosphorylation of Slp1Cdc20, the fission yeast homologue of Cdc20 and the co-activator of APC/C, which promotes the degradation of Slp1Cdc20. Both phosphorylation events are required to sustain mitotic arrest in response to spindle defects. These results clarified a detailed regulation cascade of the ubiquitous MAPK signaling in spindle checkpoint activation, APC/C inhibition and anaphase entry, which is vital for accurate chromosome segregation and cell viability.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cell extrusion is employed in maintaining a healthy epithelium. It remains unclear how environmental conditions specific to various epithelial tissues, such as geometry and fluid osmolarity, affect cell extrusions. We found that, over curved surfaces, epithelial monolayers exhibited higher extrusion rates in concave regions than convex ones. This difference, and overall extrusions, decreased when osmotically induced basal hydraulic stress was reduced by increasing media osmolarity or by culturing monolayers on hydrogels. Mechanistically, basal fluid accumulation antagonized cell-substrate adhesions and the subsequent FAK-Akt survival pathway, leading to apoptotic cell death. Convex surfaces induced cellular forces that acted against osmosis, thereby promoting adhesions and lowering apoptosis. This effect was reversed in concave regions, and together, resulted in the curvature induced spatial bias in cell extrusions.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCurvature induces forces in cell-sheets that act against/with osmosis to reduce/elevate fluid stress driven cell extrusions.",

    "abstract": "Our recent works described the rescue effect of -ketoglutarate (KG, a metabolite of Krebs cycle) on thrombosis and inflammation in animals. KG augments activity of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), which in turn degrades proline residues of substrates like phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Here we describe the inhibitory effect of octyl KG on pAkt as well as on HIF1/HIF2, and in turn decreasing SARS CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. KG failed to inhibit the viral replication and Akt phosphorylation in PHD2-knockdown U937 cells transiently expressing ACE2. Contrastingly, triciribine (TCN, an Akt-inhibitor) inhibited viral replication alongside a downmodulation of pAkt in PHD2-KD cells. Dietary KG significantly inhibited viral infection and rescued hamsters from thrombus formation and inflammation in lungs, the known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19. KG supplementation also reduced the apoptotic death of lung tissues in infected animals, alongside a downmodulation of pAkt and HIF2. KG supplementation neither affected IgG levels against SARS CoV-2 RBD protein nor altered the neutralization antibody response against SARS CoV-2. It did not interfere with the percentage of interferon-{gamma} positive (IFN{gamma}+) CD4+ and IFN{gamma}+CD8+ T cells in infected animals. The extended work in balb/c mice transiently expressing ACE2 showed a similar effect of KG in reducing accumulation of inflammatory immune cells and cytokines, including IL6, IL1{beta} and TNF, in lungs as well as in circulation of infected animals. Pro-thrombotic markers like platelet microparticles and platelet-leukocyte aggregates were reduced significantly in infected mice after KG supplementation. Importantly, KG supplementation restored the O2 saturation (SpO2) in circulation of SARS CoV-2 infected hamsters and mice, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of this metabolite in COVID-19 treatment.",

    "abstract": "Methylation of RNA at the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) is one of the most common RNA modifications, impacting RNA stability as well as its transport and translation. Previous studies uncovered RNA destabilization in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in association with accumulation of the RNA-binding protein TDP43, which is itself mislocalized from the nucleus in >95% of those with ALS. Here, we show that TDP43 recognizes m6A-modified RNA, and that RNA methylation is critical for both TDP43 binding and autoregulation. We also observed extensive hypermethylation of coding and non-coding transcripts in ALS spinal cord, many of which overlap with methylated TDP43 target RNAs. Emphasizing the importance of m6A for TDP43 binding and function, we identified several m6A factors that enhance or suppress TDP43-mediated toxicity via a single-cell CRISPR/Cas9 candidate-based screen in primary neurons. The most promising genetic modifier among these--the canonical m6A reader YTHDF2-- accumulated within spinal motor neurons in ALS postmortem sections, and its knockdown prolonged the survival of human neurons carrying ALS-associated mutations. Collectively, these data show that m6A modifications modulate RNA binding by TDP43, and that m6A is pivotal for TDP43-related neurodegeneration in ALS.",

    "abstract": "As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge, it is important to assess the neutralizing capabilities of naturally elicited antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we evaluated the activity of nine anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), previously isolated from convalescent donors infected with the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, against the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. By testing an array of mutated spike receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins, cell-expressed spike proteins from VOCs, and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs as pseudoviuses, or as the authentic viruses in culture, we show that mAbs directed against the ACE2 binding site (ACE2bs) are far more sensitive to viral evolution compared to anti-RBD non-ACE2bs mAbs, two of which kept their potency against all VOCs tested. At the second part of our study, we reveal the neutralization mechanisms at high molecular resolution of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs by structural characterization. We solved the structures of the Delta-neutralizing ACE2bs mAb TAU-2303 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer and RBD at 4.5 [A] and 2.42 [A], respectively, revealing a similar mode of binding to that between the RBD and the ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, we provide five additional structures (at resolutions of 5.54 [A], 7.76 [A], 6.47 [A], 3.45 [A], and 7.32 [A]) of a second antibody, non-ACE2bs mAb TAU-2212, complexed with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. TAU-2212 binds an exclusively quaternary epitope, and exhibits a unique, flexible mode of neutralization that involves transitioning between five different conformations, with both arms of the antibody recruited for cross linking intra- and inter-spike RBD subunits. Our study provides new mechanistic insights about how antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants and provides insight about the likelihood of reinfections.",

However, it remains unclear which mutation(s) in the spike protein determine the virological characteristics of Omicron. Here, we show that the representative characteristics of the Omicron spike are determined by its receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the acquisition of the spike S375F mutation was closely associated with the explosive spread of Omicron in the human population. We further elucidate that the F375 residue forms an interprotomer pi-pi interaction with the H505 residue in another protomer in the spike trimer, which confers the attenuated spike cleavage efficiency and fusogenicity of Omicron.

Existing proteomic approaches enable unbiased target identification but lack the throughput needed to screen larger compound libraries. Here, we present a compound interaction screen on a photoactivatable cellulose membrane (CISCM) that enables target identification of several drugs in parallel. To this end, we use diazirine-based undirected photoaffinity labeling (PAL) to immobilize compounds on cellulose membranes. Functionalized membranes are then incubated with protein extract and specific targets are identified via quantitative affinity purification and mass spectrometry. CISCM reliably identifies known targets of natural products in less than three hours of analysis time per compound.

    "abstract": "The development of mutant-selective inhibitors for the KRASG12C allele has generated considerable excitement. These KRASG12C inhibitors covalently engage the mutant C12 thiol located within the phosphoryl binding loop of RAS, locking the KRASG12C protein in an inactive state. While clinical trials of these inhibitors have been promising, mechanistic questions regarding the reactivity of this thiol remain, motivating the present studies. Measurement of the C12 thiol pKa by NMR and an independent biochemical assay found a depressed pKa (relative to free cysteine) of 7.6 consistent with its susceptibility to chemical ligation. Using a novel and validated fluorescent KRASY137W variant amenable to stopped-flow spectroscopy, we characterized the kinetics of KRASG12C fluorescence changes upon addition of ARS-853 or AMG 510, noting that ARS-853 addition at 5{degrees}C elicited both a rapid first phase (attributed to binding, yielding a Kd of 36.0 {+/-} 0.7 M), and a second, slower pH-dependent phase taken to represent covalent ligation. Consistent with the lower pKa of the C12 thiol, we found that reversible and irreversible oxidation of KRASG12C occurred readily both in vitro and in the cellular environment, preventing the covalent binding of ARS-853. Moreover, we found that oxidation of the KRASG12C thiol to sulfinic acid alters RAS conformation and dynamics to be more similar to KRASG12D in comparison to the unmodified protein, as assessed by molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, these findings provide insight for future KRASG12C drug discovery efforts as well as identifying the occurrence of G12C oxidation with currently unknown biological ramifications.",

Mutations in UPF3B cause intellectual disability. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unexplored as the mutations lie in an uncharacterized region of UPF3B. Here, we show that UPF3B shares structural and functional homology to the Drosophila Behavior/Human Splicing protein family comprising an RNA-recognition motif-like domain (RRM-L), a NONA/paraspeckle-like domain (NOPS-L), and extended -helical domains essential for ribosome- and RNA-binding and RNA-induced oligomerization. A co-crystal structure of UPF3B with the third middle domain of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (MIF4GIII) of UPF2 reveals an unexpectedly intimate binding interface. UPF3Bs disease-causing mutation Y160D located in the NOPS-L domain reduces the UPF2 binding affinity ~40-fold compared to wildtype UPF3B. UPF3Bs paralogue UPF3A, an NMD antagonist which is upregulated in patients with the UPF3B-Y160D mutation, binds UPF2 with ~10-fold higher affinity than UPF3B, leading to impaired NMD activity and upregulation of mRNAs involved in neurodevelopment.",

SEACells outperforms existing algorithms in identifying accurate, compact, and well-separated metacells in both RNA and ATAC modalities across datasets with discrete cell types and continuous trajectories. We demonstrate the use of SEACells to improve gene-peak associations, compute ATAC gene scores and measure gene accessibility in each metacell. Metacell-level analysis scales to large datasets and are particularly well suited for patient cohorts, including facilitation of data integration.

    "abstract": "The selective exchange of ions across cellular membranes is a vital biological process. Ca2+-mediated signalling is implicated in a broad array of physiological processes in cells, whilst elevated intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ are cytotoxic. Due to the significance of this cation, strict Ca2+ concentration gradients are maintained across the plasma and organelle membranes. Therefore, Ca2+ signalling relies on permeation through selective ion channels that control the flux of Ca2+ ions. A key family of Ca2+-permeable membrane channels are the polymodal signal-detecting Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels. TRP channels are activated by a wide variety of cues including temperature, small molecules, transmembrane voltage and mechanical stimuli. Whilst most members of this family permeate a broad range of cations non-selectively, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are unique due to their strong Ca2+-selectivity. Here, we address the question of how some members of the TRPV subfamily show a high degree of Ca2+-selectivity whilst others conduct a wider spectrum of cations. We present results from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of ion permeation through two Ca2+-selective and two non-selective TRPV channels. Using a new method to quantify permeation co-operativity based on mutual information, we show that Ca2+-selective TRPV channel permeation occurs by a three binding site knock-on mechanism, whereas a two binding site knock-on mechanism is observed in non-selective TRPV channels. Each of the ion binding sites involved displayed greater affinity for Ca2+ over Na+. As such, our results suggest that coupling to an extra binding site in the Ca2+-selective TRPV channels underpins their increased selectivity for Ca2+ over Na+ ions. Furthermore, analysis of all available TRPV channel structures shows that the selectivity filter entrance region is wider for the non-selective TRPV channels, slightly destabilising ion binding at this site, which is likely to underlie mechanistic decoupling.",

    "abstract": "Drug-tolerant \"dormant\" cells (DTC) have emerged as one of the major non-genetic mechanisms driving resistance to targeted therapy in lung cancer, although the sequence of events leading to entry and exit from dormancy remain poorly described. Here, we performed real-time monitoring of the cell cycle dynamics during the adaptive response to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKi) in a panel of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cell lines. We identified a rare population of S/G2 cycling cells (referred to as early escapers) that emerged in the first hours of treatment amongst stably arrested and progressively dying G1 cells. We determined that early escapers evolved from a non-proliferative differentiated alveolar type 1 (AT1) phenotype which was invariably associated with cytoskeletal remodeling through Rho/ROCK pathway activation. Using a panel of Rho-pathway inhibitors, we found that the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib induced a complete clearance of EGFR-TKi-induced DTC thus fully preventing relapse in vitro. Using a xenograft model and a PDX model of EGFRL858R/T790M lung cancer, co-treatment with tipifarnib prevented relapse to osimertinib for up to 6 months with no evidence of toxicity. Among the farnesylated proteins regulated during osimertinib treatment, concomitant inhibition of RHOE and LaminB1 was sufficient to recapitulated FTIs effect. Osimertinib and tipifarnib co-treatment completely suppressed the emergence of AT1 phenotype, prevented mitosis of S/G2-treated cells and increased the apoptotic response through activation of ATF4-CHOP-dependent Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway. Our data strongly support the use of tipifarnib in combination with osimertinib in patients to effectively and durably prevent relapse.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we identified two novel super-enhancer associated genes: NSMCE2 and MAL2, highly upregulated in breast tumors, for which high RNA levels significantly and specifically correlate with breast cancer patients poor prognosis. To approach this, we took advantage of existing datasets containing super-enhancers associated genes identified in primary breast tumors and public databases comprising gene expression, genomic and clinical outcomes for patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Through in-vitro pharmacological super-enhancer disruption assays in breast cancer cells we confirmed that super-enhancers are involved in NSMCE2 and MAL2 transcript upregulation and through bioinformatics we found that high levels of NSMCE2 strongly associate with poor response to chemotherapy. This was observed especially for patients diagnosed with aggressive triple negative and HER2 positive tumor types. Finally, we showed that treating breast cancer cells with chemotherapeutic agents while simultaneously decreasing NSMCE2 gene expression by super-enhancer blockade or by directly silencing it, reduces cell viability thus increasing the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Our results indicate that moderating the transcript levels of the novel identified super-enhancer associated gene NSMCE2 could improve patients response to standard chemotherapy and, consequently, may improve disease outcome. In summary by mining existing public breast cancer datasets, our work demonstrates that searching for super-enhancer regulated genes and their association to patients survival and response to treatment, could be an effective method for identifying a signature of tumor specific -not frequently mutated, but super-enhancer dysregulated genes. Our approach offers a new avenue to identify novel biomarkers of poor prognosis and potential pharmacological targets for improving cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "The activities of proteins can depend on their cleavage, which influences their cellular location, stability and functions. The cleavage of intracellular domains of Receptor -Like Kinases (RLK) has an important functional role in the transduction of signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in many organisms. However, the peptidases that catalyse protein cleavage during signal transduction remain poorly understood despite their crucial roles in diverse signalling processes. Here we report in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana that members of the DA1 family of ubiquitin-regulated Zn metallopeptidases cleave the cytoplasmic kinase domain of TransMembrane Kinase 1 (TMK1), releasing it for nuclear localisation where it represses auxin-responsive cell growth during apical hook formation by phosphorylation and stabilisation of the transcriptional repressors IAA32 and IAA34. Mutations in DA1 family members exhibited reduced apical hook formation, and DA1 family mediated cleavage of TMK1 was promoted by auxin treatment. Expression of the DA1 family - generated intracellular kinase domain of TMK1 by an auxin-responsive promoter fully restored apical hook formation in a tmk1 mutant, establishing the function of DA1 family peptidase activities in TMK1-mediated differential cell growth and apical hook formation. DA1 family peptidase activity therefore modulates TMK1 kinase activity between a membrane location where it stimulates acid cell growth and initiates an auxin-dependent kinase cascade controlling cell proliferation in lateral roots and a nuclear localisation where it represses auxin mediated gene expression and growth.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming (MRP) is a fundamental approach in synthetic biology that involves redirecting metabolic flux and remodeling metabolic networks. However, only few approaches have been made in effective metabolic operations, especially at global level of metabolic networks. Naturally existing cellular perception apparatuses (CPAs), such as histidine kinases (HKs), are considered to sit on sensitive nodes of the metabolic network, which can trigger natural MRP upon perceiving environmental fluctuations. We develop a plateform for global MRP by natural environmental stimulation based on the combinational interference of CPAs. The plateform consists of a CRISPRi-mediated dual-gene combinational knockdown (CDCK) strategy and survivorship-based metabolic interaction analysis (SMIA). A total of 35 histidine kinase (HK) genes and 24 glycine metabolism genes were selected as targets to determine effectiveness of our approach for fast-growing chassis Vibrio FA2. Combined knockdown of several genes of HKs and glycine metabolism increased the glycine production. Other other hand, effects of CDCK on bacterial antibiotic resistance were assessed by targeting HKs. Many HKs were identified to be associated with antibiotic resistance in Vibrio FA2, of which combinational knockdown of two HK genes sasA_8 and 04288 reduced the ampicillin resistance. This MRP strategy is powerful and cost-effective, and can be considered as a smart strategy capable of operating a broad range of metabolic networks in microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo adapt to metabolically challenging environments, the central nervous system (CNS) orchestrates metabolism of peripheral organs including skeletal muscle. The organ-communication between the CNS and skeletal muscle has been investigated, yet our understanding of the neuronal pathway from the CNS to skeletal muscle is still limited. Neurons in the dorsomedial and central parts of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHdm/c) expressing steroidogenic factor-1 (VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons) are key for metabolic adaptations to exercise, including increased basal metabolic rate and skeletal muscle mass in mice. However, the mechanisms by which VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons regulate skeletal muscle function remain unclear. Here, we show that VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons increase the sympathoadrenal activity and regulate skeletal muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1) in mice via multiple downstream nodes.\n\nMethodsOptogenetics was used to specifically manipulate VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons combined with genetically-engineered mice and surgical manipulation of the sympathoadrenal activity.\n\nResultsOptogenetic activation of VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons dramatically elevates mRNA levels of skeletal muscle Pgc-1, which regulates a spectrum of skeletal muscle function including protein synthesis and metabolism. Mechanistically, the sympathoadrenal drive coupled with {beta}2 adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AdR) is essential for VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons-mediated increases in skeletal muscle PGC1-. Specifically, both adrenalectomy and {beta}2AdR knockout block augmented skeletal muscle PGC1- by VMHdm/cSF-1 neuronal activation. Optogenetic functional mapping reveals that downstream nodes of VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons are functionally redundant to increase circulating epinephrine and skeletal muscle PGC1-.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, we propose that VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons-skeletal muscle pathway, VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons[-&gt;]multiple downstream nodes[-&gt;]the adrenal gland[-&gt;]skeletal muscle {beta}2AdR, underlies augmented skeletal muscle function for metabolic adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Influenza, a negative sense single-strand RNA virus of the genus Orthomyxoviridae, causes respiratory illness in humans and animals and significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While exposure to a specific influenza A strain causes homologous protection, two immune-dominant influenza A virus (IAV)-encoded epitopes - Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) - undergo antigenic shift and drift, resulting in IAVs to which humans lack pre-existing immunity. Without a universal vaccine or therapeutic agent, influenza virus infections will significantly threaten human health. The extracellular domain of the Matrix protein 2-ion channel (M2e) is an ideal antigenic target for a universal influenza therapy: it is highly conserved across influenza A serotypes, has a low mutation rate, and is essential for viral entry and replication. However, less than 20% of humans generate M2e-specific antibodies in response to IAV exposure, thus lacking the benefits of M2e-MAb-mediated immunity. To therapeutically address this deficit, we generated several non-neutralizing M2e-specific monoclonal antibodies (M2e-MAbs) with strong universal IAV treatment potential. Using three MAbs that bind to M2e differentially and competitively, we developed a low-dose M2e-MAb triple cocktail as an effective universal prophylactic and therapeutic agent. We identified the low-dose M2e-MAb triple cocktails optimal antibody-clone combination, isotype, minimum effective dosage, and administration time points in mouse models challenged with human and zoonotic BSL-2 and BSL-3 IAV strains, demonstrating its universal potential. Using the IgG2a isotype, which had proven most effective, we established Fc{gamma}RI, Fc{gamma}RIII, and Fc{gamma}RIV as required for M2e-MAb-mediated protection of IAV-challenged mice. Importantly, we established individual M2e-MAbs and the resulting triple cocktail as effective and viral escape mutant-resistant treatments in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. These unique qualities provide precedence for prioritizing our M2e-MAbs for therapeutic development.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENTSP serves on the scientific advisory board for Shoreline Biosciences, Qihan Biotechnology and is a Scientific Consultant for Qihan Biotechnology and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation.

    "abstract": "Alterations in the myeloid immune compartment have been observed in COVID-19, but the specific mechanisms underlying these impairments are not completely understood. Here we examined the functionality of classical CD14+ monocytes as a main myeloid cell component in well-defined cohorts of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 during the acute phase of infection and compared them to that of healthy individuals. We found that ex vivo isolated CD14+ monocytes from mild and moderate COVID-19 patients display specific patterns of costimulatory and inhibitory receptors that clearly distinguish them from healthy monocytes, as well as altered expression of histone marks and a dysfunctional metabolic profile. Decreased NF{kappa}B activation in COVID-19 monocytes ex vivo is accompanied by an intact type I IFN antiviral response. Subsequent pathogen sensing ex vivo led to a state of functional unresponsiveness characterized by a defect in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, NF{kappa}B-driven cytokine responses and defective type I IFN response in moderate COVID-19 monocytes. Transcriptionally, COVID-19 monocytes switched their gene expression signature from canonical innate immune functions to a pro-thrombotic phenotype characterized by increased expression of pathways involved in hemostasis and immunothrombosis. In response to SARS-CoV-2 or other viral or bacterial components, monocytes displayed defects in the epigenetic remodelling and metabolic reprogramming that usually occurs upon pathogen sensing in innate immune cells. These results provide a potential mechanism by which innate immune dysfunction in COVID-19 may contribute to disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are the most potent producer of type I interferon (IFN), but how pDC are primed in vivo is poorly defined. Using a mouse model of severe malaria, we have previously established that upon priming by CD169+ macrophages (MP), pDC initiate type I IFN-I secretion in the bone marrow (BM) of infected mice via cell-intrinsic TLR7 sensing and cell-extrinsic STING sensing. Herein we show that CD169+ MP and TLR7-sensing are both required for pDC arrest during priming, suggesting CD169+ MP are the source of TLR7 ligands. We establish that TLR7 sensing in pDC and chemotaxis are both required for pDC arrest and functional clustering with CD169+ MP in the BM. Lastly, we demonstrate that STING-sensing in CD169+ MP control pDC initiation of type I IFN production while also regulating pDC clustering and egress from the BM. Collectively, these results link pDC acquisition of type I IFN secreting capacity with changes in their motility, homing and interactions with CD169+ MP during infection. Thus, targeting this cellular interaction may help modulate type I IFN to improve outcomes of microbial infections and autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "A key component of insect immunity is melanin encapsulation of microbes. Melanization is also a part of an immune process known as nodulation, which occurs when insect hemocytes surround microbes and produce melanin. Insect nodules are analogous to mammalian immune granulomas. Melanin is believed to kill microbes through the production of toxic intermediates and oxidative damage. However, it is unclear to what extent immune melanin is directly fungicidal during infections of insect hosts. We reported previously that C. neoformans cells are encapsulated with host-derived melanin within hemocyte nodules. Here we report an association between melanin-based immune responses by Galleria mellonella wax moth larvae and fungal cell death of C. neoformans during infection. To monitor melanization in situ, we applied a tissue-clearing technique to G. mellonella larvae, revealing that nodulation occurs throughout the organism. Further, we developed a protocol for time-lapse microscopy of extracted hemolymph following exposure to fungal cells, which allowed us to visualize and quantify the kinetics of the melanin-based immune response. Using this technique, we found evidence that cryptococcal melanins and laccase enhance immune melanization in hemolymph. We used these techniques to also study the fungal pathogen Candida albicans infections of G. mellonella. We find that the yeast form of C. albicans was the primary targets of host melanization, while filamentous structures were melanin-evasive. Approximately 23% of melanin-encapsulated C. albicans yeast survive and break through the encapsulation. Overall, our results provide direct evidence that the melanization reaction functions as a direct antifungal mechanism in insect hosts.",

In addition to transcription factors from coding genes, non-coding RNAs may also play essential roles in shaping and directing the fate of germ cells. Here, we report the presence of many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which were specifically expressed in the germ cells during human gonadal development by single-cell profiling of the reported datasets, and the functional characterization of one divergent lncRNA, LNC1845. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of these lncRNAs indicates that divergent lncRNAs occupied the majority of female and male germ cells. Integrating lncRNA expression into the bioinformatic analysis also enhances the cell-type classification of female germ cells. Functional dissection using in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to germ cells revealed the regulatory role of LNC1845 on a transcription factor essential for ovarian follicle development, LHX8, by modulating the levels of histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac.

How these males arise in the first place has remained enigmatic, especially in species with sex chromosomes. Here, we test the hypothesis that rare, asexually produced males of the crustacean Artemia parthenogenetica are produced by recombination between the Z and W sex chromosomes during non-clonal parthenogenesis, resulting in ZZ males through loss of heterozygosity at the sex determination locus. We used RAD-sequencing to compare asexual mothers with their male and female offspring. Markers on several sex-chromosome scaffolds indeed lost heterozygosity in all male but no female offspring, suggesting that they correspond to the sex-determining region. Other sex-chromosome scaffolds lost heterozygosity in only a part of the male offspring, consistent with recombination occurring at a variable location. Alternative hypotheses for the production of these males (such as partial or total hemizygosity of the Z) could be excluded. Rare males are thus produced because recombination is not entirely suppressed during parthenogenesis in A. parthenogenetica. This finding may contribute to explaining the maintenance of recombination in these asexuals.",

HKT 1;5 gene is a known and pivotal gene associated with the salinity tolerance in plants upon the discrimination of K+ over Na+ in leaves without change in Na+ concentration in root. This gene was sequenced in a diverse collection of bread wheat, durum wheat, wild relatives, and ditelosomic lines. Sequence analysis in bread wheat led to the identification of four alleles, which could be distinguished by number of SNPs. Sequence comparison between monocot bread wheat and dicot Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the HKT1;5 gene is conserved at level of exonic regions; however, the presence of transposable elements especially in intronic regions is further intriguing towards evolutionary relatedness. Two paralogous or major alleles observed in Triticum monoccum and Aegilops tauschii were further categorized as sub-alleles based on their SNPs comparison. This gene was absent in T. urartu in accordance with existing evidence, while it was found in A. speltoides (an allelic variant) with a few base pairs insertion in the exon1 region causing a frameshift mutation with an altered amino acids and genomic database mining unveiled additional alleles in this species. Ditelosomic lines with 4DL and 4DS chromosomes revealed a higher similarity with bread and durum wheat respectively. Phylogenetic studies of HKT1;5 orthologs from different Poaceae species revealed the occurrence of five different ortholog groups with taxonomic consistency. Phenotyping based salinity stress experiment distinguished the unknown lines for salinity tolerance and sensitiveness in comparison with known reference lines and possible allelic comparison was made. The salinity stress analysis further revealed that some known drought/heat tolerance lines showed slightly better salinity tolerance with mean values and variability of traits than known saline tolerant wheat line at controlled ambient.",

    "abstract": "Vegetative incompatibility is a fungal allorecognition system characterised by the inability of genetically distinct conspecific fungal strains to form a viable heterokaryon, and is controlled by multiple polymorphic loci termed vic (vegetative incompatibility) or het (heterokaryon incompatibility). We have genetically identified and characterised the first vic locus in the economically important, plant-pathogenic, necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. A bulked segregant approach coupled with whole genome Illumina sequencing in near-isogenic lines of cinerea was used to map a 60-kb genomic region for a vic locus. Within that locus, we identified two adjacent, highly polymorphic open reading frames, Bcvic1 and Bcvic2, which encode predicted proteins that contain domain architectures implicated in vegetative incompatibility in other filamentous fungi. Bcvic1 encodes a predicted protein containing a putative serine esterase domain, a NACHT family of NTPases domain, and several Ankyrin repeats. Bcvic2 encodes a putative syntaxin protein containing a SNARE domain; such proteins typically function in vesicular transport. Deletion of Bcvic1 and Bcvic2 individually had no effect on vegetative incompatibility. However, deletion of the region containing both Bcvic1 and Bcvic2 resulted in mutant lines that were severely restricted in growth and showed loss of vegetative incompatibility. Complementation of these mutants by ectopic expression restored the growth and vegetative incompatibility phenotype, indicating that Bcvic1 and Bcvic2 are controlling vegetative incompatibility at this vic locus.\n\nAuthor SummaryFungal colonies are characterised by radiating filaments, termed hyphae, which often fuse to form a highly interconnected individual. This is advantageous since it enables efficient water and nutrient utilisation across a colony network. However, hyphal fusion is not necessarily restricted to within an individual colony, with potential for hyphal fusion between individuals belonging to the same species. There are, however, drawbacks to this. For instance, viruses that detrimentally affect a colony may be transmitted, with their infection leading to a reduction in the virulence of a pathogenic species. Fungi have therefore developed complex systems to prevent fusion between genetically distinct individuals of the same species. This phenomenon is termed vegetative incompatibility and results in the death of fused cells and cessation of transfer of cellular contents from one individual to another. We have identified the first genes in the fungal plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea that control this phenomenon. They resemble genes that control vegetative incompatibility in other fungi, and genes involved in immunity in plants and animals. Uncovering further genes involved in vegetative incompatibility in B. cinerea may pave the way for the development of a  super donor strain capable of overriding vegetative incompatibility to transmit viruses, thus enabling their exploitation as potent control agents against this damaging plant pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Tocochromanols (tocopherols and tocotrienols, collectively vitamin E) are lipid-soluble antioxidants important for both plant fitness and human health. The main dietary sources of vitamin E are seed oils that often accumulate high levels of tocopherol isoforms with lower vitamin E activity. The tocochromanol biosynthetic pathway is conserved across plant species but an integrated view of the genes and mechanisms underlying natural variation of tocochromanol levels in seed of most cereal crops remains limited. To address this issue, we utilized the high mapping resolution of the maize Ames panel of [~]1,500 inbred lines scored with 12.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms to generate metabolomic (mature grain tocochromanols) and transcriptomic (developing grain) data sets for genetic mapping. By combining results from genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies, we identified a total of 13 candidate causal gene loci, including five that had not been previously associated with maize grain tocochromanols: four biosynthetic genes (arodeH2 paralog, dxs1, vte5, and vte7) and a plastid S-adenosyl methionine transporter (samt1). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping of these 13 gene loci revealed that they are predominantly regulated by cis-eQTL. Through a joint statistical analysis, we implicated cis-acting variants as responsible for co-localized eQTL and GWAS association signals. Our multi-omics approach provided increased statistical power and mapping resolution to enable a detailed characterization of the genetic and regulatory architecture underlying tocochromanol accumulation in maize grain and provided insights for ongoing biofortification efforts to breed and/or engineer vitamin E and antioxidant levels in maize and other cereals.",

We studied the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms to flour rancidity in contrasting inbreds under 21-day accelerated storage. Rapid TAG decrease was accompanied by FFA increase in high rancidity genotype compared to the low rancidity line, that maintained lower FFA and high TAG levels, besides lower headspace aldehydes. DNA sequence polymorphisms observed in two lipase genes revealed loss-of-function mutations that were functionally confirmed in yeast system. We outline a direct mechanism for mutations in these key TAG lipases in pearl millet and the protection of TAG and fatty acids from hydrolytic and oxidative rancidity respectively.

Mass spectrometric methods that rely on pulsed metabolic labeling are very popular to quantify turnover rates on a proteome-wide scale. Such data have often been interpreted in the context of protein proteolytic stability. Here, we combine theoretical kinetic modeling with experimental pulsed stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC) for the study of protein phosphorylation. We demonstrate that metabolic labeling combined with PTM-specific enrichment does not measure effects of PTMs on protein stability. Rather, it reveals the relative order of PTM addition and removal along a proteins lifetime--a fundamentally different metric. We use this framework to identify temporal phosphorylation sites on cell cycle-specific factors and protein complex assembly intermediates. Our results open up an entirely new aspect in the study of PTMs, by tying them into the context of a proteins lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Secretory preproteins of the Sec pathway bear signal peptides and are targeted post-translationally to cross the plasma membrane or ER through translocases. After translocation and signal peptide cleavage, mature domains fold to native states in the bacterial periplasm or after further trafficking. During cytoplasmic transit, mature domains must remain non-folded for translocase recognition and translocation. Here, we sought the structural basis for the delayed folding mechanism of mature domains and how this is regulated by signal peptides. To address this, we compared how evolution diversified a periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PpiA mature domain from its structural twin cytoplasmic PpiB. Using global and local hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry we showed that PpiA is a slower folder. We defined at near-residue resolution hierarchical folding initiated by similar foldons in the twins, that displayed different order and rates. Folding is delayed in PpiA by less hydrophobic/bulky native contacts, frustrated residues and a critical {beta} -turn in the early folding region and by signal peptide-driven disorder, which disrupts foldon hierarchy. When selected PpiA residues and its signal peptide were grafted onto PpiB they converted it into a slow folder with enhanced in vivo secretion. These data reveal the structural basis of non-folding in a secretory protein, that allows its trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The pH is a critical parameter in chain-elongating bioreactors, affecting: (1) the concentration of inhibitory undissociated carboxylic acids, which in turn affects the efficiency of product extraction; (2) the thermodynamics; and (3) the kinetics. Here, we examined the effect of five different pH levels (5.5 to 7.0) on n-caprylate (C8) production using an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) with continuous membrane-based liquid-liquid extraction (pertraction). We found that the product spectrum was directed by pH: mildly acidic pH (5-6) led to n-caproate (C6) production, while near-neutral and neutral pH (6.75-7) favored n-caprylate production. In particular, the pH of 6.75 led to the maximum values of volumetric n-caprylate production rate (75.6 {+/-} 0.6 mmol C L-1 d-1; 0.06 g L-1 d-1) and n-caprylate concentration in the fermentation broth (420 mM C; 7.57 g L-1). Given that methane production remained low at near-neutral and neutral pH, we theorized that the high concentration of undissociated n-caprylic acid (5.71 mM C) inhibited methanogenesis. We then demonstrated such an inhibitory effect at neutral pH in: (1) microcosm experiments; and (2) the continuous bioreactor by adding methanogenic sludge. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that near-neutral and neutral pH led to more diverse microbial communities than at mildly-acidic pH. For the first time, we report predominant n-caprylate production in a microbiome at near-neutral and neutral pH conditions where methanogenesis was controlled by the inhibitory effects of undissociated n-caprylic acid. At the same time, extraction of this species occurred even at near-neutral and neutral pH.",

The objective of this study was the assessment of complementary diffusion measures extracted with a novel approach, Apparent Measures Using Reduced Acquisitions (AMURA), in comparison with DTI in clinical studies. Fifty healthy controls, 51 episodic migraine and 56 chronic migraine patients underwent single-shell diffusion MRI. Three DTI-based and eight AMURA-based parameters were compared between groups with tract-based spatial statistics. On the other hand, following a region-based analysis, the measures were assessed for multiple subsamples with diverse reduced sample sizes and their stability was evaluated with the coefficient of quartile variation. Compared to DTI, statistically significant differences in additional regions and group comparisons were found with AMURA-based measures. Additionally, some AMURA-based measures showed a remarkable discriminative power for quite reduced sample size and, simultaneously, lower stability (higher coefficient of quartile variation) than DTI-based measures. These findings suggest that AMURA presents favorable characteristics to identify differences of specific microstructural properties between clinical groups in regions with complex fiber architecture and lower dependency on the sample size or assessing technique than DTI.",

Combined with host genetic predisposition, diet and gut bacteria are thought to be prominent features contributing to IBD, but little is known about the precise mechanisms involved. Here, we show that low dietary fiber promotes bacterial erosion of protective colonic mucus, leading to lethal colitis in mice lacking the IBD-associated cytokine, interleukin-10. Diet-induced inflammation is driven by mucin-degrading bacteria-mediated Th1 immune responses and is preceded by expansion of natural killer T cells and reduced immunoglobulin A coating of some bacteria. Surprisingly, an exclusive enteral nutrition diet, also lacking dietary fiber, reduced disease by increasing bacterial production of isobutyrate, which is dependent on the presence of a specific bacterial species, Eubacterium rectale. Our results illuminate a mechanistic framework using gnotobiotic mice to unravel the complex web of diet, host and microbial factors that influence IBD.",

The rough moss frog, Arthroleptella rugosa, is small and occurs in seepages on a single unprotected mountain in South Africas fire prone, biodiverse fynbos biome. The area is heavily impacted by invasive plants, which dry seepages and increase the frequency and intensity of fires, leading to the assessment of this species as Critically Endangered. We aimed to test the efficacy of acoustic spatially explicit capture recapture (aSCR) to estimate the entire population of calling adult A. rugosa, and assess the impacts by invasive plants. Using aSCR, our estimates suggest that the population of A. rugosa is more than five times that previously estimated using aural calling surveys on the mountain, at [~]2000 individuals. This despite an intense fire over the entire area three years earlier that reduced the calling population to a few tens of individuals. Our vegetation surveys suggest that the ongoing removal of invasive plants from the mountain is successful in areas occupied by A. rugosa, but that adjacent areas invaded by pines and hakea have a negative impact on calling density. The private public conservancy partnership on Klein Swartberg Mountain, is conserving this frog but will require ongoing management and monitoring to ensure conservation in the future.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor function, motivation, and attentional processes are fundamental aspects of behavioral organization during skilled tasks. NASAs planned expedition to Mars will expose astronauts to space radiation (SR) that has the potential to impair performance in mission critical tasks. Impairments in task accuracy and movement kinematics have been previously reported during string-pulling behavior ~7 months after SR exposure. If similar SR-induced sensorimotor deficits emerge at earlier times, then astronauts may have compromised in-flight performance disruptions while performing skilled tasks in critical situations, such as when manipulating controls or performing seat egress. Due to the possibility that such performance losses may compromise mission success, it is critical to determine if sensorimotor, motivation, or attentional deficits occur acutely after SR exposure at a time point that corresponds to in-flight performance. Male Wistar rats were thus exposed to either 10 cGy simplified galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim), 10 cGy 4Helium (4He), or no radiation at all (Sham), and string-pulling behavior was assessed approximately 72 hours later. Following exposure to SR, rats (4He) took more time to approach the string to initiate string-pulling behavior and to pull in the string to reach the Cheerio (4He and GCRsim) relative to Sham rats. 4He-exposed rats also exhibited a greater number of misses and less contacts relative to both Sham and GCRsim-exposed rats. Further, rats exposed to 4He demonstrated less concentrated reach endpoints with both the left and right hands compared to GCR-exposed rats. This work suggests that sensorimotor function and motivation and/or attentional processes were impaired 72 hours after 4He-radiation exposure.",

    "abstract": "Insect exposure to their predators can affect individuals and community processes, through direct consumption or nonlethal (i.e., nonconsumptive) effects. However, the links between behavioural and physiological responses and stimuli needed for development of the fear are not clear. We therefore subjected the desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) to three nonlethal treatments, using the great tits (Parus major) as a potential predator. The treatments involved: (1) bird - presence of a live great tit and its calls, (2) call - great tit calls only, (3) control - without any treatment. In the first behavioural laboratory experiment, hungry locusts were kept in an experimental cage with a shelter and food on opposite sides of the cage. The duration of hiding and feeding were considered as an indicator of fear responses. In the second laboratory experiment with the same three treatments, levels of the adipokinetic hormone (AKH) were evaluated in the central nervous system (CNS) and haemolymph. In the third experiment in an outdoor aviary, birds were free to fly in larger distances from locusts, before hormone levels were measured as response to bird and control treatments. In the first behavioural experiment, the presence of tits and their call resulted in significantly longer hiding time and significantly shorter feeding time than in the call/control treatments. The proximity of birds and locusts in the laboratory experiment elicited a significant increase in the AKH levels in the CNS and haemolymph as compared to the call/control treatments. In the outdoor experiment, the AKH levels were significantly higher in the CNS of locusts exposed to the bird than to control; no difference was recorded in their haemolymph. We showed that predator exposure quickly affected behavioural responses and physiological processes of locusts. Playback of the avian calls was not an appropriate stimulus to induce stress responses in desert locusts.",

    "abstract": "Controlled fluid flows are the hallmark feature of microfluidic culture systems and provide precise definition over the biophysical and biochemical microenvironment. Flow control is commonly achieved using displacement-based (e.g., syringe or peristaltic pumps) or pressure-based techniques. These methods offer complex flow capabilities but can be challenging to integrate into incubators or other confined environments due to their large form factors and accompanying peripheral equipment. Since many microfluidic cell culture studies use a single controlled flow rate to maintain or stimulate cells, a portable flow control platform that fits easily into an incubator will benefit the microfluidic community. Here, we demonstrate that a tunable, 3D printed micro pressure regulator (PR), combined with a battery-powered miniature air pump, can operate as a stand-alone pneumatic flow control platform for microfluidic applications. We detail the design and fabrication of the PR and demonstrate: i) a tunable outlet pressure range relevant for microfluidic applications (1-10 kPa), ii) highlight dynamic control in a microfluidic network, and iii) maintain human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a multi-compartment membrane-based culture device under continuous flow conditions. We anticipate that our 3D-printed fabrication approach and open access designs will allow other laboratories to rapidly customize PRs to support a broad range of applications.",

    "abstract": "All artificial stimulation of the brain deposits thermal energy in the brain. This occurs through either Joule heating of the conductors carrying current through electrodes and magnetic coils, or through dissipation of energy in the conductive brain. Similarly, temperature affects all biological processes and chemical reactions. Although electrical interaction with brain tissue is inseparable from thermal effects when electrodes are used, magnetic induction enables us to separate Joule heating from induction effects by contrasting AC and DC driving of magnetic coils using the same energy deposition within the conductors. Since mammalian cortical neurons have no known sensitivity to static magnetic fields, and if there is no evidence of effect on spike timing to oscillating magnetic fields, we can presume that the induced electrical currents within the brain are below the molecular shot noise where any interaction with tissue is purely thermal. In this study, we examined a range of frequencies produced from micromagnetic coils operating below the molecular shot noise threshold for electrical interaction with single neurons. We found that small temperature increases and decreases of 1{degrees}C caused consistent transient suppression and excitation of neurons during temperature change. Numerical modeling of the biophysics demonstrated that the Na-K pump, and to a lesser extent the Nernst potential, could account for these transient effects. Such effects are dependent upon compartmental ion fluxes, and the rate of temperature change. A new bifurcation is described in the model dynamics that accounts for the transient suppression and excitation; in addition, we note the remarkable similarity of this bifurcations rate dependency with other thermal rate-dependent tipping points in planetary warming dynamics. Furthermore, bifurcations in the steady state dynamics leading to stable firing suppression are described for slightly higher temperatures. These experimental and theoretical findings demonstrate that stimulation of the brain must take into account small thermal effects that are ubiquitously present in electrical and magnetic stimulation. More sophisticated models of electrical current interaction with neurons combined with thermal effects will be required in order to more accurately enable model-based control of neuronal circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has developed into a set of powerful techniques that has improved spatial resolution over diffraction-limited microscopy and demonstrated the ability to resolve biological features at the very molecular scale. We introduce a single molecule based scanning SMLM (scanSMLM) system that enables rapid volume imaging. Using a standard widefield illumination, the system employs a scanning based detection 4f-sub-system suited for volume interrogation. The 4f system comprises of a combination of electrically-tunable lens and high NA detection objective lens. By rapidly changing the aperture (or equivalently the focus) of electrically-tunable lens (ETL) in a 4f detection system, the selectivity of axial (Z) plane can be achieved in the object plane, for which the corresponding image forms in the image/detector plane. So, in-principle one can scan the object volume by just changing the aperture of ETL. To carry out volume imaging, a cyclic scanning scheme is developed and compared with conventional scanning routinely used in SMLM. The scanning scheme serves the purpose of distributing photobleaching evenly by ensuring uniform dwell time on each frame for collecting data (single molecule events) throughout the specimen volume. With minimal change in the system hardware (requiring an addition of ETL lens and related hardware for step-voltage generation) in the existing SMLM system, volume scanning (along z-axis) can be achieved. To demonstrate, we imaged fluorescent beads embedded in a gel-matrix 3D block as a test sample. Subsequently, scanSMLM is employed to understand clustering of HA single molecules in a transfected cell (Influenza A disease model). The system for the first time enables visualization of HA distribution in a 3D cells that reveal its clustering across the cell volume. Critical biophysical parameters related to HA clusters (density, #HA/cluster and clustered fraction) are also determined.",

    "abstract": "Thioredoxins (TRX) are pivotal for the redox regulation of enzyme activities to adjust metabolic fluxes towards environmental changes. Previous reports demonstrated TRX o1 and h2 impact on mitochondrial metabolism including photorespiration and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Here, we aimed to unravel potential specificities between regulation modes of both TRXs, especially under conditions with short-term changes in photorespiration. Therefore, short-term metabolite responses of single TRX mutants were analyzed after exposure to altered CO2/O2 ratios during darkness and illumination. This approach was complemented by comprehensive characterization of multiple Arabidopsis mutants lacking either one or both TRX in the wild-type Arabidopsis or the glycine decarboxylase (GDC) T-protein knock down line (gldt1). The results provided evidence for additive effects of combined TRX o1 and h2 deficiency to suppress growth, photosynthesis and mitochondrial metabolism. Quantification of pyrimidine nucleotides in conjunction with metabolite and 13C-labelling approaches revealed a rather uniform impact on mitochondrial dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (mtLPD1) dependent pathways. Biochemical analysis of recombinant mtLPD1 demonstrated its inhibition by NADH, pointing at an additional measure to fine-tune its in vivo activity. Collectively, we propose that TRX o1 and h2 contribute to the communication of altered subcellular redox-states through direct and indirect regulation of mtLPD1. This regulation module might represent a common intercept for simultaneous adjustments in the operation of photorespiration, the TCA-cycle and the degradation of branched chain amino acids.\n\nOne-sentence summaryRedox regulation of mitochondrial dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (mtLPD1) simultaneously modulates photorespiration, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation in response to rapid environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "The field of epigenomics holds great promise in understanding and treating disease with advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence being vitally important in this pursuit. Increasingly, research now utilises DNA methylation measures at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) to detect disease and estimate biological traits such as aging. Given the high dimensionality of DNA methylation data, feature-selection techniques are commonly employed to reduce dimensionality and identify the most important subset of features. In this study, we test and compare a range of feature-selection methods and ML algorithms in the development of a novel DNA methylation-based telomere length (TL) estimator. We found that principal component analysis in advance of elastic net regression led to the overall best performing estimator when evaluated using a nested cross-validation analysis and two independent test cohorts. In contrast, the baseline model of elastic net regression with no prior feature reduction stage performed worst - suggesting a prior feature-selection stage may have important utility. The variance in performance across tested approaches shows that estimators are sensitive to data set heterogeneity and the development of an optimal DNA methylation-based estimator should benefit from the robust methodological approach used in this study. Additionally, we observed that different DNA methylation-based TL estimators, which have few common CpGs, are associated with many of the same biological entities. Moreover, our methodology which utilises a range of feature-selection approaches and ML algorithms could be applied to other biological markers and disease phenotypes, to examine their relationship with DNA methylation and predictive value.",
