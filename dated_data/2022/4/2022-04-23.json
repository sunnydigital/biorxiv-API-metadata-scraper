    "abstract": "CIC encodes a transcriptional repressor and MAPK signalling effector that is inactivated by loss-of-function mutations in several cancer types, consistent with a role as a tumour suppressor. Here, we used bioinformatic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to investigate CICs interaction networks. We observed both previously identified and novel candidate interactions between CIC and SWI/SNF complex members, and also observed novel interactions between CIC and cell cycle regulators and RNA processing factors. We found that CIC loss is associated with an increased frequency of mitotic defects in human cell lines and an in vivo mouse model and with dysregulated expression of mitotic regulators. We also observed aberrant splicing in CIC-deficient cell lines predominantly at 3 and 5 untranslated regions of genes, including genes involved in MAPK signalling, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation. Our study thus characterises the complexity of CICs functional network and describes the effect of its loss on cell cycle regulation, mitotic integrity, and transcriptional splicing, thereby expanding our understanding of CICs potential roles in cancers. In addition, our work exemplifies how multi-omic, network-based analyses can be used to uncover novel insights into the interconnected functions of pleiotropic genes/proteins across cellular contexts.\n\nSimple summaryCapicua (CIC) is a gene that is frequently mutated in several cancer types, including stomach cancers and certain subtypes of brain tumours and sarcomas. CIC, the protein encoded by the CIC gene, has been shown to play a multitude of roles in both normal and cancer cell functions; however, most studies exploring these roles focus on a single aspect of CIC function and may therefore overlook complex interconnected activities in which CIC is involved. In this study, we have used multiple complementary approaches to obtain a broader view of CICs complex functional networks. We observed novel interactions (genetic or physical) between CIC and genes/proteins involved in various aspects of cellular function, including regulation of cell division and processing of RNA molecules. Altogether, our work characterises the complexity of CICs functional network and expands our understanding of its potential roles in cancer.",

High-throughput single-cell data reveal an unprecedented view of cell identity and allow complex variations between conditions to be discovered; nonetheless, most methods for differential expression target differences in the mean and struggle to identify changes where the mean is only marginally affected. distinct is based on a hierarchical non-parametric permutation approach and, by comparing empirical cumulative distribution functions, identifies both differential patterns involving changes in the mean, as well as more subtle variations that do not involve the mean. We performed extensive bench-marks across both simulated and experimental datasets from single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry data, where distinct shows favourable performance, identifies more differential patterns than competitors, and displays good control of false positive and false discovery rates. distinct is available as a Bioconductor R package.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis, wound healing and some cancer metastases depend upon migration of cell collectives that need to be guided to their destination as well as coordinated with other cell movements. During zebrafish gastrulation, extension of the embryonic axis is led by the mesendodermal polster that migrates towards the animal pole, followed by axial mesoderm that undergoes convergence and extension. We here investigate how polster cells are guided towards the animal pole. Using a combination of precise laser ablations, advanced transplants and functional as well as in silico approaches, we establish that each polster cell is oriented by its immediate follower cells. Each cell perceives the migration of followers, through E-Cadherin/-Catenin mechanotransduction, and aligns with them. Directional information therefore propagates from cell to cell over the whole tissue. Such guidance of migrating cells by followers ensures long-range coordination of movements and developmental robustness.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive radiations involve astounding bursts of phenotypic, ecological, and species diversity. However, the microevolutionary processes that underlie the origins of these bursts are still poorly understood. We report the discovery of an intermediate  wide-mouth scale-eating ecomorph in a sympatric radiation of Cyprinodon pupfishes, illuminating the transition from a widespread algae-eating generalist to a novel microendemic scale-eating specialist. We first show that this ecomorph occurs in sympatry with generalist C. variegatus and scale-eating specialist C. desquamator on San Salvador Island, Bahamas, but is genetically differentiated, morphologically distinct, and often consumes scales. We then compared the timing of selective sweeps on shared and unique adaptive variants in trophic specialists to characterize their adaptive walk. Shared adaptive regions swept first in both the specialist desquamator and the intermediate  wide-mouth ecomorph, followed by unique sweeps of introgressed variation in  wide-mouth and de novo variation in desquamator. The two scale-eating populations additionally shared 9% of their hard selective sweeps with molluscivores C. brontotheroides, despite no single common ancestor among specialists. Our work provides a new microevolutionary framework for investigating how major ecological transitions occur and illustrates how both shared and unique genetic variation can provide a bridge for multiple species to access novel ecological niches.",

    "abstract": "Incidental memory can be challenged by increasing either the retention delay or the memory load. The dorsal hippocampus (dHP) appears to help with both consolidation from short-term (STM) to long-term memory (LTM), and higher memory loads, but the mechanism is not fully understood. Here we find that female mice, despite having the same STM capacity of 6 objects and higher resistance to distraction in our different object recognition task (DOT), when tested over 1h or 24h delays appear to transfer to LTM only 4 objects, whereas male mice have an STM capacity of 6 objects in this task. In male mice the dHP shows greater activation (as measured by c-Fos expression), whereas female mice show greater activation of the ventral midline thalamus (VMT). Optogenetic inhibition of the VMT-dHP pathway during off-line memory consolidation enables 6-object LTM retention in females, while chemogenetic VMT-activation impairs it in males. Thus, removing or enhancing sub-cortical inhibitory control over the hippocampus, leads to differences in incidental memory.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe sex-dependent recruitment of a subcortical pathway regulates how many items are spontaneously memorized in mice.",

    "abstract": "What is the cognitive and neural architecture for high-level reasoning? We hypothesize that systems for understanding people and places remain separate throughout the brain, but share a parallel organization. We test this hypothesis using deep neuroimaging of individual human brains on diverse tasks involving reasoning and memory about familiar people, places, and objects. We find that thinking about people and places elicits responses in distinct areas of high-level association cortex, spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Person- and place-preferring brain regions are systematically yoked across cortical zones. These areas have strongly domain-specific response profiles across visual, semantic, and episodic tasks, and are specifically functionally connected to other parts of association cortex with like category preference. Social and spatial networks are anatomically separated even at the top of the cortical hierarchy, and include parts of cortex with anatomical connections to the hippocampal formation. These results demonstrate parallel, domain-specific networks within the cortical apex. They suggest that domain-specific systems for reasoning constitute components of a broader cortico-hippocampal system for long-term memory.",

    "abstract": "Although there is mounting evidence that input from the dorsal visual pathway is crucial for object processes in the ventral pathway, the specific functional contributions of dorsal cortex to these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that dorsal cortex computes the spatial relations among an objects parts - a processes crucial for forming global shape percepts - and transmits this information to the ventral pathway to support object categorization. Using fMRI with human participants (females and males), we discovered regions in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) that were selectively involved in computing object-centered part relations. These regions exhibited task-dependent functional and effective connectivity with ventral cortex, and were distinct from other dorsal regions, such as those representing allocentric relations, 3D shape, and tools. In a subsequent experiment, we found that the multivariate response of posterior IPS, defined on the basis of part-relations, could be used to decode object category at levels comparable to ventral object regions. Moreover, mediation and multivariate effective connectivity analyses further suggested that IPS may account for representations of part relations in the ventral pathway. Together, our results highlight specific contributions of the dorsal visual pathway to object recognition. We suggest that dorsal cortex is a crucial source of input to the ventral pathway and may support the ability to categorize objects on the basis of global shape.\n\nSignificance StatementHumans categorize novel objects rapidly and effortlessly. Such categorization is achieved by representing an objects global shape structure, that is, the relations among object parts. Yet, despite their importance, it is unclear how part relations are represented neurally. Here, we hypothesized that object-centered part relations may be computed by the dorsal visual pathway, which is typically implicated in visuospatial processing. Using fMRI, we identified regions selective for the part relations in dorsal cortex. We found that these regions can support object categorization, and even mediate representations of part relations in the ventral pathway, the region typically thought to support object categorization. Together, these findings shed light on the broader network of brain regions that support object categorization.",

Despite the availability of innate DNA damage response pathways, some genomic lesions trigger cells for malignant transformation. Accurate prediction of carcinogens is an ever-challenging task due to the limited information about bona fide (non)carcinogens. We developed Metabokiller, an ensemble classifier that accurately recognizes carcinogens by quantitatively assessing their electrophilicity as well as their potential to induce proliferation, oxidative stress, genomic instability, alterations in the epigenome, and anti-apoptotic response. Concomitant with the carcinogenicity prediction, Metabokiller is fully interpretable since it reveals the contribution of the aforementioned biochemical properties in imparting carcinogenicity. Metabokiller outperforms existing best-practice methods for carcinogenicity prediction. We used Metabokiller to unravel cells endogenous metabolic threats by screening a large pool of human metabolites and predicted a subset of these metabolites that could potentially trigger malignancy in normal cells. To cross-validate Metabokiller predictions, we performed a range of functional assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells with two Metabokiller-flagged human metabolites namely 4-Nitrocatechol and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and observed high synergy between Metabokiller predictions and experimental validations.",

    "abstract": "Age-related frailty is a significant health and social care burden, however treatment options are limited. There is currently a lack of suitable cell culture model for screening large numbers of test compounds to identifying those which can potentially promote healthy skeletal muscle function. This paper describes the characterization of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) signalling changes in young and aged myoblasts and myotubes using the C2C12 cell line, and the application of aged myoblast and myotube cultures to assess the effect of dietary polyphenols on RONS signalling. Aged myoblasts and myotubes were observed to have significantly increased reactive oxygen species levels (p<0.01 and p<0.001 respectively), increases in nitric oxide levels (p<0.05 for myoblasts and myotubes), and lipid peroxidation markers (p<0.05 for myoblasts and myotubes). A panel of nine polyphenols were assessed in aged myoblasts and myotubes using concentrations and incubation times consistent with known pharmacokinetic parameters for these compounds. Of these, although several polyphenols were seen to reduce single markers of RONS signalling, only kaempferol and resveratrol consistently reduced multiple markers of RONS signalling with statistical significance in both cell models. Modulation of cellular enzymatic antioxidant activities (superoxide and catalase) was assessed as a possible mechanism of action for these polyphenols, and although both superoxide and catalase activities were significantly reduced in aged (versus young) myotubes (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), no effect of polyphenol treatment on these enzyme activities were observed. Overall, this research has shown the utility of the C2C12 model, as both myoblasts and myotubes, as a suitable cell model for screening compounds for modulating RONS signalling in aged muscle, and that resveratrol and kaempferol (using pharmacokinetically-informed exposures) can modulate RONS signalling in skeletal muscle cells after an acute exposure.",

However, multi-omics analysis of the regulation networks for Fx biosynthesis in I. galbana has not been reported. In this study, we report a high-quality genome sequence of I. galbana LG007, which has a 92.73 Mb genome size, with a contig N50 of 6.99 Mb and 14,900 protein-coding genes. Phylogenomic inferences confirmed the monophyly of Haptophyta, with I. galbana sister to Emiliania huxleyi and Chrysochromulina tobinii. Evolutionary analysis revealed an estimated divergence time between I. galbana and E. huxleyi of ~ 133 million years ago (Mya). Gene family analysis indicated that lipid metabolism-related genes exhibited significant expansion, including IgPLMT, IgOAR1 and {Delta}-4 desaturase. Metabolome analysis showed that the content of carotenoid in I. galbana cultured under green light for 7 days was higher than that of white light, and {beta}-carotene was the main carotenoids, accounting for 79.09% of the total carotenoids. Comprehensive analysis of multi-omics analysis revealed that {beta}-carotene, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, and Fx content was increased by green light induction, which was significantly correlated with the expression of IgMYB98, IgZDS, IgPDS, IgLHCX2, IgZEP, IgLCYb, and IgNSY.

    "abstract": "The spinal stretch reflex is a fundamental building block of motor function, with a sensitivity that varies continuously during movement and when changing between movement and posture. Many have investigated task-dependent reflex sensitivity, but few have provided simple, quantitative analyses of the relationship between the volitional control and stretch reflex sensitivity throughout tasks that require coordinated activity of several muscles. Here we develop such an analysis and use it to test the hypothesis that modulation of reflex sensitivity during movement can be explained by the balance of activity within agonist and antagonist muscles better than by activity only in the muscle homonymous with the reflex. Subjects completed hundreds of flexion and extension movements as small, pseudo-random perturbations of elbow angle were applied to obtain estimates of stretch reflex amplitude throughout the movement. A subset of subjects performed a postural control task at muscle activities matched to those during movement. We found that reflex modulation during movement can be described by background activity in antagonist muscles about the elbow much better than by activity only in the muscle homonymous to the reflex (p<0.001). Agonist muscle activity enhanced reflex sensitivity whereas antagonist activity suppressed it. Surprisingly, the magnitude of these effects was similar, suggesting a balance of control between agonists and antagonists very different from the dominance of sensitivity to homonymous activity during posture. This balance is due to a large decrease in sensitivity to homonymous muscle activity during movement rather than substantial changes in the influence of antagonistic muscle activity.\n\nNew and NoteworthyThis study examined the sensitivity of the stretch reflexes elicited in elbow muscles to the background activity in these same muscles during movement and postural tasks. We found a heightened reciprocal control of reflex sensitivity during movement that was not present during maintenance of posture. These results help explain previous discrepancies in reflex sensitivity measured during movement and posture and provide a simple model for assessing their contributions to muscle activity in both tasks.",

    "abstract": "Technological developments have led to an explosion of high-throughput single cell data, which are revealing unprecedented perspectives on cell identity. Recently, significant attention has focused on investigating, from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, cellular dynamic processes, such as cell differentiation, cell cycle and cell (de)activation. Trajectory inference methods estimate a trajectory, a collection of differentiation paths of a dynamic system, by ordering cells along the paths of such a dynamic process. While trajectory inference tools typically work with gene expression levels, common scRNA-seq protocols allow the identification and quantification of unspliced pre-mRNAs and mature spliced mRNAs, for each gene. By exploiting the abundance of unspliced and spliced mRNA, one can infer the RNA velocity of individual cells, i.e., the time derivative of the gene expression state of cells. Whereas traditional trajectory inference methods reconstruct cellular dynamics given a population of cells of varying maturity, RNA velocity relies on a dynamical model describing splicing dynamics. Here, we initially discuss conceptual and theoretical aspects of both approaches, then illustrate how they can be combined together, and finally present an example use-case on real data.",

    "abstract": "Cancer driver mutations often display mutual exclusion or co-occurrence, underscoring the key role of epistasis in carcinogenesis. However, estimating the magnitude of epistasis and quantifying its effect on tumor evolution remains a challenge. We developed a method to quantify COnditional SELection on the Excess of Nonsynonymous Substitutions (Coselens) in cancer genes. Coselens infers the number of drivers per gene in different partitions of a cancer genomics dataset using covariance-based mutation models and determines whether coding mutations in a gene affect selection for drivers in any other gene. Using Coselens, we identified 296 conditionally selected gene pairs across 16 cancer types in the TCGA dataset. Conditional selection affects 25-50% of driver substitutions in tumors with >2 drivers. Conditionally co-selected genes form modular networks, whose structures challenge the traditional interpretation of within-pathway mutual exclusivity and across-pathway synergy, suggesting a more complex scenario, where gene-specific across-pathway epistasis shapes differentiated cancer subtypes.",

    "abstract": "The development of musculoskeletal tissues such as tendon, enthesis, and bone relies on proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells. Gli1+ cells have been described as putative stem cells in several tissues and are presumed to play critical roles in tissue formation and maintenance. For example, the enthesis, a fibrocartilage tissue that connects tendon to bone, is mineralized postnatally by a pool of Gli1+ progenitor cells. These cells are regulated by hedgehog signaling, but it is unclear if TGF{beta} signaling, necessary for tenogenesis, also plays a role in their behavior. To examine the role of TGF{beta} signaling in Gli1+ cell function, the receptor for TGF{beta}, TbR2, was deleted in Gli1-lineage cells in mice at P5. Decreased TGF{beta} signaling in these cells led to defects in enthesis formation by P56, including deficient bone morphometry underlying the enthesis and decreased mechanical properties. In vitro experiments using Gli1+ cells isolated from mouse tail tendons demonstrated that TGF{beta} controls cell proliferation and differentiation through canonical and non-canonical pathways and that TGF{beta} directly controls the tendon transcription factor scleraxis by binding to its distant enhancer. These results have implications in the development of treatments for tendon and enthesis pathologies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring aging, muscle gradually undergoes loss of function including sarcopenia, losing mass, strength, endurance, and oxidative capacity. While mitochondrial aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial capacity, the genes associated with morphological changes in mitochondria during aging still require further elucidation. Furthermore, it is not completely understood how 3D mitochondrial structures are altered during aging in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissues.\n\nMethodsWe measured changes in mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial complexity during the aging of murine gastrocnemius, soleus, and cardiac tissues using serial block face- scanning electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction. Lipidomic and metabolomic analysis elucidated concomitant changes associated with aging. We also used qPCR, transmission electron microscopy quantification, Seahorse Analyzer, and metabolomics to evaluate changes in mitochondria morphology and function upon loss of the MICOS complex.\n\nResultsWe identified significant changes in 3D mitochondrial size and network configuration in murine gastrocnemius, soleus, and cardiac tissue during aging. These changes were concomitant with loss of mitochondria contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) gene expression during aging. Mitochondrial morphology was similar between aged mice and young mice. We show an age-related loss of the MICOS complex (Chchd3, chchd6, and Mitofilin) while their knockout results in alterations in mitochondrial morphology. Given the critical role of mitochondria in maintaining cellular metabolism, we perform cellular metabolic profiling of young and aged tissues. Metabolomics and lipidomics showed profound alterations, including in membrane integrity, that support our observations of age-related changes in these muscle tissues.\n\nDiscussionIn tandem, our data suggest a relationship between the MICOS complex and aging, which could be linked to disease states with further 3D reconstruction studies. Our study highlights the importance of understanding tissue-dependent 3D mitochondrial phenotypical changes which occur across aging with evolutionary conservation between Drosophila and murine models.\n\nGraphical Abstract",

A conventional structure-based drug design pipeline is a complex, human-engineered pipeline with multiple independently optimized steps. Advances in end-to-end differentiable learning suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating drug design. Here, we proposed a new sequence-to-drug paradigm that discovers drug-like small-molecule modulators directly from protein sequences and validated this concept for the first time in three stages. First, we designed TransformerCPI2.0 as a core tool for the sequence-to-drug paradigm, which exhibited competitive performance with conventional structure-based drug design approaches. Second, we validated the binding knowledge that TransformerCPI2.0 has learned. Third, we applied a sequence-to-drug paradigm to discover new hits for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases: speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), ring finger protein 130 (RNF130) which does not have a 3D structure, and repurposed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). This first proof of concept shows that the sequence-to-drug paradigm is a promising direction for drug development.",

The length of the reads makes it comparatively easy to look at patterns consisting of multiple loci; here we exploit this property to look for regions where one can define subpopulations of cells based on methylation patterns. As a benchmark we run our clustering algorithm on known imprinted genes and show that the clustering based on methylation is consistent with the phasing of the genome; we then scan chromosome 15 looking for windows corresponding to heterogeneous methylation. We can also compute the covariance of methylation across these regions while keeping into account the mixture of different types of reads.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/EmanueleRaineri/releases\n\nContactemanuele.raineri@cnag.crg.eu, simon.heath@cnag.crg.eu\n\nSupplementary informationTables, figures, and some further explanations of the algorithms are available as online supplementary information.",

    "abstract": "The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a major therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Following activation, GLP-1Rs are rapidly desensitised by {beta}-arrestins, scaffolding proteins that terminate G protein interactions but also act as independent signalling mediators. While GLP-1R interacts with {beta}-arrestins 1 and 2, expression of the latter is greatly enhanced in beta cells, making this the most relevant isoform. Here, we have assessed in vivo glycaemic responses to the pharmacological GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 in adult beta cell-selective {beta}-arrestin 2 knockout (KO) mice. Lean female and high-fat, high-sucrose-fed KO mice of both sexes displayed worse acute responses versus control littermates, an effect that was inverted 6 hours post-agonist injection, resulting in prolonged in vivo cell-cell connectivity in KO islets implanted in mouse eyes. Similar effects were observed for the clinically relevant semaglutide and tirzepatide but not with exendin-phe1, an agonist biased away from {beta}-arrestin recruitment. Ex vivo acute cAMP was impaired, but overnight desensitisation was reduced in KO islets. The acute signalling defect was attributed to enhanced {beta}-arrestin 1 and phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 activity in the absence of {beta}-arrestin 2, while the reduced desensitisation correlated with altered GLP-1R trafficking, involving impaired recycling and lysosomal targeting and increased trans-Golgi network (TGN) localisation and signalling, as well as reduced GLP-1R ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4. This study has unveiled fundamental aspects of the role of {beta}-arrestin 2 in regulating pharmacological GLP-1R responses with direct application to the rational design of improved GLP-1R-targeting therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Binding to host cell receptors, CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4, triggers conformational changes in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer that promote virus entry. CD4 binding allows the gp120 exterior Env to bind CCR5/CXCR4 and induces a pre-hairpin intermediate conformation in the gp41 transmembrane Env. Small-molecule CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mcs) bind within the conserved Phe-43 cavity of gp120, near the binding site for CD4. CD4mcs inhibit HIV-1 infection by competing with CD4 and by prematurely activating Env, leading to irreversible inactivation. BNM-III-170 is a CD4mc that inhibits the infection of approximately 70% of HIV-1 strains at micromolar concentrations. We selected and analyzed variants of the primary HIV-1AD8 strain resistant to BNM-III-170. Two changes (S375N and I424T) in gp120 residues that flank the Phe-43 cavity each conferred [~]5-fold resistance to BNM- III-170 with minimal fitness cost. A third change (E64G) in Layer 1 of the gp120 inner domain resulted in [~]100-fold resistance to BNM-III-170, [~]2-3-fold resistance to soluble CD4-Ig, and a moderate decrease in viral fitness. The gp120 changes additively or synergistically contributed to BNM-III-170 resistance. The sensitivity of the Env variants to BNM-III-170 inhibition of virus entry correlated with their sensitivity to BNM-III-170- induced Env activation and shedding of gp120. The S375N and I424T changes, but not the E64G change, conferred resistance to BMS-806, a potent HIV-1 entry inhibitor that blocks Env conformational transitions. These studies identify pathways whereby HIV-1 can develop resistance to CD4mcs and BMS-806 conformational blockers, two classes of entry inhibitors that target the conserved gp120 Phe-43 cavity.\n\nIMPORTANCECD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mcs) and BMS-806 are small-molecule inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) entry into host cells. Although CD4mcs and BMS-806 inhibit HIV-1 entry by different mechanisms, they both target a pocket on the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) spike that is used for binding to the receptor, CD4, and is highly conserved among HIV-1 strains. Our study identifies changes near this pocket that can confer various levels of resistance to the antiviral effects of both a CD4mc and BMS-806. We relate the antiviral potency of a CD4mc against this panel of HIV-1 variants to the ability of the CD4mc to activate changes in Env conformation and to induce the shedding of the gp120 exterior Env from the spike. These findings will guide efforts to improve the potency and breadth of small-molecule HIV-1 entry inhibitors.",

Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis have been carried out on 40 charred seeds, 6 faunal remains and 4 human specimens, investigating the whole bio-archaeological samples available. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first papers presenting stable isotope analysis on carpological remains dated to the Italian Early-Middle Bronze Age. The obtained results are consistent with a diet based on terrestrial protein, mainly on plants and secondly on meat and animal products. The data suggest that plants, especially broad beans, were partially subjected to human management, while livestock was managed through different husbandry strategies. The cooperation between archaeological studies and molecular analysis allows us to contribute to clarify the economic strategies for a Central Italian community in a scenario that is still poor in published data.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a program of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, and cytokine release induced by stress exposure in metazoan cells. Landmark studies in laboratory mice have characterized a number of master senescence regulators, including p16INK4a, p21, NF-kB, p53, and C/EBP{beta}. To discover other molecular players in senescence, we developed a screening approach to harness the evolutionary divergence between mouse species. We found that primary cells from the Mediterranean mouse Mus spretus, when treated with DNA damage to induce senescence, produced less cytokine and had less-active lysosomes than cells from laboratory M. musculus. We used allele-specific expression profiling to catalog senescence-dependent cis-regulatory variation between the species at thousands of genes. We then tested for correlation between these expression changes and interspecies sequence variants in the binding sites of transcription factors. Among the emergent candidate senescence regulators, we chose a little-studied cell cycle factor, USF2, for molecular validation. In acute irradiation experiments, cells lacking USF2 had compromised DNA damage repair and response. Longer-term senescent cultures without USF2 mounted an exaggerated senescence regulatory program--shutting down cell cycle and DNA repair pathways, and turning up cytokine expression, more avidly than wild-type. We interpret these findings under a model of pro-repair, anti-senescence regulatory function by USF2. Our study affords new insights into the mechanisms by which cells commit to senescence, and serves as a validated proof of concept for natural variation-based regulator screens.",

    "abstract": "Life depends on proteins, which all exist in nascent states when the growing polypeptide chain is covalently attached to a tRNA within the ribosome. Although the nascent chains; i.e., polypeptidyl-tRNAs (pep-tRNAs), are considered as merely transient intermediates during protein synthesis, recent advances have revealed that they are directly involved in a variety of cell functions, such as gene expression control. An increasing appreciation for fine-tuning at translational levels demands a general method to handle the pep-tRNAs on a large scale. Here, we developed a method termed peptidyl-tRNA enrichment using organic extraction and silica adsorption (PETEOS), and then identify their polypeptide moieties by mass spectrometry. As a proof-of-concept experiment using Escherichia coli, we identified [~]800 proteins derived from the pep-tRNAs, which were markedly biased towards the N-termini in the proteins, reflecting that PETEOS captured the intermediate pep-tRNA population during translation. Furthermore, we observed the changes in the pep-tRNA set in response to heat shock or antibiotic treatments. In summary, PETEOS will complement conventional methods for profiling nascent chains such as ribosome profiling.\n\nSignificance StatementIn the central dogma of biology, RNA and protein are usually regarded as two completely independent molecular species. However, they are combined into a single species called peptidyl-tRNA (pep-tRNA) during the translation process in the ribosome. Despite the importance of pep-tRNAs as precursors of all proteins in the cell, a general method to analyze pep-tRNAs on a large scale was lacking. Taking advantage of the properties of pep-tRNAs as RNA and protein, we developed a method to enrich the pep-tRNAs by organic solvent extraction and silica column separation. The method, termed PETEOS, not only provides a unique approach to examine the nascent state of proteins but also may be effective in capturing snapshots of translation status in the cell.",

To fill the void, we studied USCGs in the most updated bacterial RefSeq genomes. We showed that different USCG sets are quite different while coming from highly similar functional categories. We also found that although USCGs occur once in almost all bacterial genomes, each USCG does occur multiple times in certain genomes. We demonstrated that USCGs are reliable markers to distinguish different species while they cannot distinguish different strains of most bacterial species.

Here, we structurally aligned the diverse RNR family by the conserved catalytic barrel to reconstruct the first large-scale phylogeny consisting of 6,779 sequences that unites all extant classes of the RNR family and performed evo-velocity analysis to independently validate our evolutionary model. With a robust phylogeny in-hand, we uncovered a novel, phylogenetically distinct clade that is placed as ancestral to the classes I and II RNRs, which we have termed clade O. We employed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and AlphaFold2 to investigate a member of this clade from Synechococcus phage S-CBP4 and report the most minimal RNR architecture to-date. Using the catalytic barrel as a starting point for diversification, we traced the evolutionarily relatedness of insertions and extensions that confer the diversity observed in the RNR family.

    "abstract": "A self-consistent analytical solution for binodal concentrations of the two-component Flory-Huggins model is derived. We show that this form extends the validity of the Ginzburg-Landau expansion away from the critical point to cover the whole phase space. Furthermore, this analytical solution reveals an exponential scaling law of the dilute phase binodal concentration as a function of interaction strength and chain length. We demonstrate explicitly the power of this approach by fitting experimental protein liquid-liquid phase separation boundaries to determine the effective chain length and the solute-solvent interaction energy. Moreover, we demonstrate that this strategy allows us to resolve the differences in the interaction energy contributions of individual amino acids. This analytical framework can serve as a new way to decode the protein sequence grammar for liquid-liquid phase separation.",

    "abstract": "Communication between organelles and the nucleus is referred to as anterograde (nucleus to organelle) and retrograde (organelle to nucleus) signalling. In plants, the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins represent a large family of nuclear-encoded proteins that are required for post-transcriptional control of chloroplast and mitochondria gene expression, and hence play a central role in the nuclear anterograde control of organelle genome expression. How PPR gene expression is controlled and regulated by retrograde signals is, however, still unknown. Here, we report a significant role for the general transcription factor TFIIF -subunit (TFIIF) in controlling PPR gene expression in Arabidopsis. First, we found that TFIIF interacts with the BIN4 subunit of the Topoisomerase VI (Topo VI). Transcriptome analysis of TFIIF and Topo VI mutant lines then revealed that many PLS-type PPR genes involved in RNA editing are reciprocally controlled by TFIIF and Topo VI. The misexpression of CLB19 and DYW1 genes in two allelic tfIIf mutants was associated with editing impairments in their plastid target RNAs rpoA and ndhD, respectively. Interestingly, we also detected a change in NDH activity in tfIIf plants. We also show that TFIIF and Topo VI coordinate the expression of NDH subunits encoded by the nuclear and plastid genomes. These results reveal the crucial role of the nuclear TFIIF and Topo VI complexes in controlling plastid genome expression at multiple levels of regulation, including the particular regulation of PPR gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Accurate quantitation of antibody is critical for development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics (mAbs). Therapeutic drug monitoring has been applied to measure levels of mAbs in clinics for dose adjustment for autoimmune disease. Trough levels of mAbs can be a biomarker for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, the deployment of a rapid and universal platform for mAb monitoring may benefit processes ranging from drug development to clinical practice for a wide spectrum of diseases. However, mAb monitoring often requires development and conduct of an individual ligand binding assay such as ELISA, which is impractical to scale. We streamlined quantitation of antibody therapeutics by a nano-surface and molecular-orientation limited (nSMOL) proteolysis assay using LC-MS with a universal reference antibody (refmAb-Q), for accurate multiplexed quantitation of unique signature peptides derived from mAbs. This innovative refmAb-Q nSMOL platform may provide a practical solution for quantitating an ever-increasing number of mAbs from developmental to clinical use settings.",

    "abstract": "The Vegetative insecticidal protein Vip3A is produced by some Bacillus thuringiensis strains from the mid-log growth phase to sporulation. Although Vip3A is important for the entomopathogenicity of B. thuringiensis, the vip3A gene regulation is unknown. In the B. thuringiensis kurstaki HD1 strain, vip3A is carried by the pBMB299 plasmid, which is absent in the closely related strain B. thuringiensis kurstaki HD73. Using a transcriptional fusion between the vip3A promoter and lacZ, we observed that the HD73 strain is unable to express vip3A. This result suggests that a specific regulator is required for vip3A expression. Assuming that the regulator gene is located on the same plasmid as vip3A, we transferred the pBMB299 from the HD1 strain to the HD73 strain. We found that Vip3A was produced in the HD73 strain containing pBMB299, suggesting that the regulator gene is located on this plasmid. Using this heterologous host and promoter-lacZ transcription fusions, we confirmed that VipR is essential to activate vip3A expression at the onset of stationary phase. We demonstrated that vipR transcription is positively autoregulated and the determination of the vipR and vip3A promoters pinpointed a putative VipR target upstream from the Sigma A-specific -10 region of these two promoters. Surprisingly, this conserved sequence was also found upstream of cry1I and cry2 genes. Finally, we showed that vip3A and vipR expression is drastically increased in a {Delta}spo0A mutant unable to initiate sporulation. In conclusion, we have characterized a novel regulator involved in the entomopathogenic potency of B. thuringiensis through a sporulation-independent pathway.\n\nImportanceThe insecticidal properties of Bacillus thuringiensis are mainly due to Cry toxins which form a crystalline inclusion during sporulation. However, other proteins participate in the pathogenicity of the bacterium, notably the Vip3A toxins that are produced from vegetative growth to sporulation. The VipR regulator that activates vip3A gene expression at the onset of stationary phase is positively autoregulated and analysis of the promoter region of the vip3A and vipR genes reveals the presence of a highly conserved DNA sequence. This possible VipR target sequence is also found upstream of the cry2A and cry1I genes, suggesting that Cry toxins can be produced before the bacteria enter sporulation. Such a result could allow us to better understand the role of Cry and Vip3A toxins during the B. thuringiensis infectious cycle in insects, in addition to the primary role of the Cry toxins in the toxemia caused by ingestion of crystals.",

    "abstract": "Molecular cloning techniques enabling contemporaneous expression of two or more protein-coding sequences in a cell type of interest provide an invaluable tool for understanding the molecular regulation of cellular functions. DNA recombination employing the Cre-lox system is commonly used as a molecular switch for inducing the expression of recombinant proteins encoded within a bicistronic cassette. In such an approach, the two protein-coding sequences are separated by a 2A peptide or internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and expression is designed to be strictly Cre-dependent by using a lox-STOP-lox cassette or flip-excision (FLEX) switch. However, low-level or  leaky expression of recombinant proteins is often observed in the absence of Cre activity, potentially compromising the utility of this approach. To investigate the mechanism of leaky gene expression, we generated pCAG-lox-GFP-STOP-lox-Transgene A-2A-Transgene B vectors, which are designed to express nuclear-targeted GFP in the absence of Cre, and express both transgenes A and B after Cre-mediated recombination. We found that cells transfected with these bicistronic vectors exhibited low-level Cre-independent expression specifically of the transgene positioned 3' of the 2A peptide. We observed similar results in vivo by viral transduction of the adult mouse cerebral cortex with AAV-mutagenesis of putative transcription factor binding sites that the 5' transgene confers promoter-like activity that drives expression of the 3' transgene. Finally, we demonstrate that inclusion of an additional lox-STOP-lox cassette between the 2A sequence and 3' transgene dramatically reduces the extent of Cre-independent leaky gene expression. Our findings highlight that caution should be applied to the use of Cre-dependent bicistronic constructs when tight regulation of transgene expression is desired and provide a guide to preventing leaky gene expression when the expression of more than one protein is required.",

    "abstract": "Spliceosome activation is the process of creating the catalytic site for RNA splicing and occurs de novo on each intron following spliceosome assembly. Dozens of factors bind to or are released from the activating spliceosome including the Lsm2-8 heteroheptameric ring that binds the U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) 3-end. Lsm2-8 must be released to permit active site stabilization by the Prp19-containing complex (NineTeen Complex, NTC); however, little is known about the temporal order of events and dynamic interactions that lead up to and follow Lsm2-8 release. We have used colocalization single molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) to visualize Lsm2-8 dynamics during activation of yeast spliceosomes. Lsm2-8 is recruited as a component of the tri-snRNP and is released after integration of the Prp19-containing complex (NineTeen Complex, NTC). Despite Lsm2-8 and the NTC being mutually exclusive in existing cryo-EM structures of yeast B complex spliceosomes, we identify a transient intermediate containing both [Formula] and provide a kinetic framework for its formation and transformation during activation. Prior to [Formula] assembly, the NTC rapidly and reversibly samples the spliceosome suggesting a mechanism for preventing NTC sequestration by defective spliceosomes that fail to properly activate. In complementary ensemble assays, we show that a base-pairing dependent ternary complex can form between Lsm2-8 and U2 and U6 helix II RNAs. Together our data suggest a Hfq-like function for Lsm2-8 in maintaining U2/U6 helix II integrity before it can be transferred to the NTC by transient formation of the [Formula] spliceosome.\n\nSignificance StatementThe spliceosome active site is created de novo during activation and involves numerous conformational and compositional changes. Here, we define a kinetic pathway for yeast spliceosome activation using single molecule fluorescence that includes transient intermediates not previously identified. Real-time measurements allow us to uncover rapid, reversible sampling interactions of the NineTeen Complex (NTC) that may prevent its accumulation on defective spliceosomes. By analogy with bacterial Hfq, we propose that the homologous Lsm2-8 proteins stabilize U2/U6 helix II during activation before the helix is transferred to the NTC in a short-lived spliceosome containing both Lsm2-8 and the NTC. Our data demonstrate how single molecule studies of activation can reveal kinetically-competent intermediates and complement cryo-EM studies of stalled or inhibited complexes.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen in the female lower reproductive tract is a major carbon source for vaginal colonization and acidification by common vaginal Lactobacillus species, such as Lactobacillus crispatus. Previously we identified the pullulanase gene pulA in Lactobacillus crispatus, correlating with its ability to autonomously utilize glycogen for growth. Here we further characterize genetic variation and differential regulation of pulA affecting the presence of its gene product on the outer surface layer. We show that alpha-glucan degrading activity dissipates when Lactobacilllus crispatus is grown on glucose, maltose and maltotriose, in agreement with carbon catabolite repression elements flanking the pulA gene. Proteome analysis of the S-layer confirmed that the pullulanase protein is highly abundant in an S-layer enriched fraction, but not in a strain with a defective pullulanase variant or in a pullulanase-sufficient strain grown on glucose. In addition, we provide evidence that Lactobacillus crispatus pulA mutants are relevant in vivo, as they are commonly observed in metagenome datasets of human vaginal microbial communities. Analysis of the largest publicly available human vaginal metagenome dataset indicates that 15 out of 272 samples, containing a Lactobacillus crispatus pulA gene, contain a defective variant of this gene. Another 23 out of 272 samples show large deletions or transposon insertions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that both environmental as well as genetic factors explain variation of Lactobacillus crispatus alpha-glucosidases in the vaginal environment.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota contributes enzymatic functions that are unavailable to host cells and play crucial roles in host metabolism, nutrient processing and regulating immune functions. As dietary compounds that are only partially absorbed, flavonoids are available for metabolism by gut microbiota, leading to diverse bioactive products. Combining prediction of enzyme promiscuity, metabolomics, and in vitro model systems, we identified a bacterial enzyme that can catalyze heterocyclic C-ring cleavage of naringenin. Culture experiments using a wild-type and mutant strain of Bacillus subtilis confirmed that the enzyme is a chalcone synthase-like polyketide synthase. The prediction-validation methodology developed in this work could be used to systematically characterize the products of gut bacterial flavonoid metabolism and identify the responsible enzymes and species. Further, we demonstrated that naringenin and its ring cleavage metabolites differentially engage the AhR and NR4A in intestinal epithelial cells. Our results suggest that the abundance of selected gut bacterial species impacts the profile of bioactive flavonoids and flavonoid-derived metabolites and thereby influences inflammatory responses in the intestine. These results are significant for understanding the mechanisms of gut microbiota-dependent effects of dietary flavonoids.",
