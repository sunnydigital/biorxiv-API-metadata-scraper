    "abstract": "The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of a range of medically important viruses including dengue, Zika, West Nile, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis wAlbB strain is a promising biocontrol agent for blocking viral transmission by Ae. aegypti. To predict the long-term efficacy of field applications, a thorough understanding of the interactions between symbiont, host, and pathogen is required. Wolbachia influence host physiology in a variety of ways including reproduction, immunity, metabolism, and longevity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes and viruses. A number of miRNAs are known to regulate biological processes in Drosophila and mosquitoes, including facilitating Wolbachia maintenance. We generated the first chromosomal map of Ae. aegypti miRNAs, and compared miRNA expression profiles between a wAlbB-transinfected Ae. aegypti mosquito line and a tetracycline cleared derivative, using deep small RNA-sequencing. We found limited modulation of miRNAs in response to wAlbB infection. Several miRNAs were modulated in response to age, some of which showed greater upregulation in wAlbB-infected mosquitos than in tetracycline cleared ones. By selectively inhibiting some differentially expressed miRNAs, we identified miR-2946-3p and miR-317-3p as effecting mosquito longevity.\n\nImportanceWolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium found in about 65% of insect species. It is mostly known for reproductive manipulations of the host, and also blocking replication of positive sense RNA viruses. Transinfection of Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which transmit a variety of arboviruses, including dengue virus, has provided a novel biological approach in reducing transmission of arboviruses. To gain a better understanding of Wolbachia-mosquito interactions, we investigated the impact of Wolbachia on the microRNA profile of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. We produced the first chromosome-level map of Ae. Aegypti miRNAs. We found modulation of microRNAs in mosquitoes due to age, with two miRNAs, 317-3p and 2946-3p, showing significant increase with age. Inhibition of 317-3p and 2946-3p led to reduced mosquito life span in wAlbB-infected mosquitoes. The outcomes provide insights into underlying molecular mechanisms involved in Wolbachia-host interactions.",

Here, we used metagenomics to investigate the virome diversity in Haemaphysalis japonica, H. conicinna, Dermacentor silvarum, and Ixodes persulcatus ticks in northeastern China. A total of 22 RNA viruses were identified and belonged to more eight viral families, including four each in Nairoviridae and Phenuiviridae, three each in Flaviviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Solemoviridae, two in Chuviridae, and one each in Partitiviridae, Tombusviridae, and unclassified. Of them, eight viruses were novel species, belonging to Nairoviridae (Jian nairovirus and Yichun nairovirus), Phenuiviridae (Mudanjiang phlebovirus), Rhabdoviridae (Tahe rhabdovirus 1-3), Chuviridae (Yichun mivirus), and Tombusviridae (Yichun tombus-like virus), and five members were established human pathogens, including Alongshan virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Songling virus, Beiji nairovirus, and Nuomin virus. I. persulcatus ticks had significant higher viral species than those in H. japonica, H. concinna, and D. silvarum ticks. Significant differences in tick viromes were observed among Daxingan, Xiaoxingan and Changbai mountains. These findings showed an extensive diversity of RNA viruses in ticks in northeastern China, revealed potential public health threats from the emerging tick-borne viruses. Further studies are needed to explain the natural circulation and pathogenicity of these viruses.",

    "abstract": "The rapid spread and dominance of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 over its Delta variant has posed severe global challenges. While extensive research on the role of the Receptor Binding Domain on viral infectivity and vaccine sensitivity has been documented, the role of the spike 681PRRAR/SV687 polybasic motif is less clear. Here we monitored infectivity and vaccine sensitivity of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus against sera samples that were drawn four months post administration of the third dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Our findings show that relative to Wuhan-Hu and Delta SARS-CoV-2, Omicron displayed enhanced infectivity and a sharp decline in its sensitivity to vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, while the spike proteins form Wuhan-Hu (P681), Omicron (H681) and BA.2 (H681) pseudoviruses modestly promoted cell fusion and syncytia formation, Delta spike (P681R) displayed enhanced fusogenic activity and syncytia formation capability. Live-viruses plaque formation assays confirmed these findings and demonstrated that relatively to the Wuhan-Hu and Omicron SARS-CoV-2, Delta formed more plaques that were smaller in size. Introducing a single P681R point mutation within the Wuhan-Hu spike, or H681R within Omicron spike, restored fusion potential to similar levels observed for Delta spike. Conversely, a R681P point mutation within Delta spike efficiency abolished fusion potential. We conclude that over time, the efficiency of the third dose of the Pfizer vaccine against SARS CoV-2 is waned, and cannot neutralize Omicron. We further verify that the P681 position of the viral spike dictates fusogenicity and syncytia formation.",

    "abstract": "Histone chaperones are an important class of proteins that regulate chromatin accessibility for DNA-templated processes. Spt6 is a conserved histone chaperone and key regulator of transcription and chromatin structure. However, its functions outside of these roles have been little explored. In this work, we demonstrate a role for S. cerevisiae Spt6 in DNA replication and more broadly as a regulator of genome stability. Spt6 binds the replication machinery and depletion or mutation of Spt6 impairs DNA replication in vivo. Additionally, spt6 mutants are sensitive to DNA replication stress inducing agents, with increased sensitivity when combined with loss of DNA replication associated factors. Furthermore, spt6 mutants have elevated levels of DNA double strand breaks and recombination. These effects appear to be independent of R-loops, which are not elevated in spt6 mutants. Our results identify Spt6 as a regulator of genome stability, at least in part through a role in DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type kappa (PTPRK) is a transmembrane receptor that links extracellular homophilic interactions to intracellular catalytic activity. Previously we showed that PTPRK promotes cell-cell adhesion by selectively dephosphorylating several cell junction regulators including the protein Afadin (Fearnley et al., 2019). Here we demonstrate that Afadin is recruited for dephosphorylation by directly binding to the PTPRK D2 pseudophosphatase domain. We mapped this interaction to a putative coiled coil (CC) domain in Afadin that is separated by more than 100 amino acids from the substrate pTyr residue. We identify the residues that define PTP specificity, explaining how Afadin is selectively dephosphorylated by PTPRK yet not by the closely-related receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRM. Our work demonstrates that PTP substrate specificity can be determined by protein-protein interactions distal to the active site. This explains how PTPRK and other PTPs achieve substrate specificity despite a lack of specific sequence context at the substrate pTyr. Furthermore, by demonstrating that these interactions are phosphorylation-independent and mediated via binding to a non-catalytic domain, we highlight how receptor PTPs could function as intracellular scaffolds in addition to catalyzing protein dephosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Mediator is a large and evolutionarily conserved coactivator complex essential for RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated gene regulation at multiple steps of the transcription process, including preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly and function. Here, we used the MultiBac baculovirus expression system to generate recombinant human core Mediator subcomplexes and subsequent biochemical approaches to dissect the mechanism by which Mediator facilitates direct recruitment of Pol II to core promoters. Our results highlight a pivotal role in this process for the N-terminal half (NTD) of the MED14 subunit. We show that a reconstituted 15-subunit human core Mediator complex that contains only the MED14-NTD is fully functional in facilitating both basal and activated (p53) transcription. This complex directly interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1 subunit of Pol II (RPB1 CTD) and is required for recruiting Pol II to core promoters. Moreover, recombinant RPB1 can completely reverse the human core Mediator-Pol II interaction. Notably, the human MED14-NTD region has secondary structure conservation with Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In addition, reanalysis of published cryo-EM structures of yeast Mediator-Pol II complexes strongly supports our conclusion. Thus, our analyses provide critical new insights into how Mediator binds to Pol II and recruits it to the promoters to facilitate transcription.",

    "abstract": "Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a congenital condition characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the uterus and vagina in women with a typical 46,XX karyotype. This condition can occur as type I when isolated or as type II when associated with extragenital anomalies including kidney and skeletal abnormalities. The genetic basis of MRKH syndrome remains unexplained and several candidate genes have been proposed to play a role in its etiology, including HNF1B, LHX1, and WNT4. Here, we conducted a genomic analysis of 13 women affected by MRKH syndrome, resulting in the identification of candidate genes, including several novel candidates. We focused on HNF1B for further investigation due to its known association with, but unknown etiological role in, MRKH syndrome. We ablated Hnf1b specifically in the epithelium of the Mullerian ducts in mice, and found that this caused hypoplastic development of both the epithelial and stromal compartments of the uterus, as well as kidney anomalies, closely mirroring the MRKH type II phenotype. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of uterine tissue in the Hnf1b-ablated embryos, we analyzed the molecules and pathways downstream of Hnf1b, revealing a dysregulation of processes associated with cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Thus, we establish that loss of Hnf1b function leads to an MRKH phenotype, and generate the first mouse model of MRKH syndrome type II. Our results support the diagnostic value of HNF1B in clinical genetic testing for MRKH syndrome, and shed new light on the genetic causes of this poorly understood condition in womens reproductive health.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that the microtubule plus-end-tracking protein CLASP1 is required for neonatal lung function and survival. CLASP1 is expressed in the lungs and associated respiratory structures throughout embryonic development. Clasp1 disruption in mice caused intrauterine growth restriction and neonatal lethality due to acute respiratory failure. Knockout animals showed impaired lung inflation associated with smaller rib cage formation and abnormal diaphragm innervation. Live-cell analysis of microtubule dynamics in cultured hippocampal neurons revealed an increased catastrophe rate, consistent with a role of CLASP1 in neurite outgrowth. Histological and gene expression studies indicated that CLASP1 is required for normal pneumocyte differentiation and fetal lung maturation. Thus, CLASP1-mediated regulation of microtubule dynamics assists multiple systems essential for neonatal lung function and survival.",

Analysis of whole genome sequences (WGS) of Mab demonstrates dense genetic clustering of clinical isolates collected from disparate geographic locations. This has been interpreted as supporting patient-to-patient transmission, but epidemiological studies have contradicted this interpretation. Here we present evidence for a slowing of the Mab molecular clock rate coincident with the emergence of phylogenetic clusters. We find that clustered isolates are enriched in mutations affecting DNA repair machinery and have lower spontaneous mutation rates in vitro. We propose that Mab adaptation to the host environment through variation in DNA repair genes affects the organisms mutation rate and that this manifests as phylogenetic clustering. These results inform our understanding of niche switching for facultative pathogens and challenge the model of transmission as the major mode of dissemination of clinically dominant Mab clusters.",

    "abstract": "The metabolite succinate accumulates during cardiac ischemia. Within 5 min. of reperfusion, succinate returns to baseline levels via both its release from cells and oxidation by mitochondrial complex II (Cx-II). The latter drives reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pore, leading to cell death. Targeting succinate dynamics (accumulation/oxidation/release) may be therapeutically beneficial in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. It has been proposed that blocking monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) may be beneficial in IR, by preventing succinate release and subsequent engagement of downstream inflammatory signaling pathways. In contrast, herein we hypothesized that blocking MCT-1 would retain succinate in cells, exacerbating ROS generation and IR injury. Using the mitochondrial ROS probe mitoSOX, and a custom-built murine heart perfusion rig built into a spectrofluorometer, we measured ROS generation in-situ during the first moments of reperfusion, and found that acute MCT-1 inhibition enhanced mitochondrial ROS generation at reperfusion, and worsened IR injury (recovery of function and infarct size). Both these effects were abrogated by tandem inhibition of Cx-II, suggesting that succinate retention worsens IR due to driving more mitochondrial ROS generation. Furthermore, using the PT pore inhibitor cyclosporin A, along with monitoring of PT pore opening via the mitochondrial membrane potential indicator TMRE, we herein provide evidence that ROS generation during early reperfusion is upstream of the PT pore, not downstream as proposed by others. In addition, pore opening was exacerbated by MCT-1 inhibition. Together, these findings highlight the importance of succinate dynamics and mitochondrial ROS generation, as key determinants of PT pore opening and IR injury outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To protect themselves from the constant threat of bacteriophage (phage) infection, bacteria have evolved diverse immune systems including restriction/modification, CRISPR/Cas, and many others. Here we describe the discovery of a two-protein transcriptional regulator module associated with hundreds of CBASS (Cyclic oligonucleotide Based Anti-phage Signaling System) immune systems, and demonstrate that this module drives expression of its associated CBASS system in response to DNA damage. We show that the helix-turn-helix transcriptional repressor CapH binds the promoter region of its associated CBASS system to repress transcription until it is cleaved by the metallopeptidase CapP. CapP is inactive except in the presence of single-stranded DNA, and CapP activity in cells is stimulated by DNA-damaging drugs. Together, CapH and CapP drive increased expression of their associated CBASS system in response to DNA damage. In both their structures and mechanisms, CapH and CapP resemble regulators that drive increased expression of DNA damage response genes in radiation-resistant Deinococcus, and control the mobilization of prophages and mobile elements in response to DNA damage. We also identify CapH and CapP-related proteins associated with diverse known and putative bacterial immune systems, including DISARM and two uncharacterized operons encoding proteins related to eukaryotic ubiquitin signaling pathways. Overall, our data highlight a mechanism by which bacterial immune systems can sense and respond to a universal stress signal, potentially enabling multiple immune systems to mount a coordinated defensive effort against an invading pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cells are found in the perivascular niche microenvironment and are believed to associate closely with the brain microvasculature. However, it is largely unknown how the resident cells of the perivascular niche, such as endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, influence GBM tumor cell behavior and disease progression. We describe a three-dimensional in vitro model of the brain perivascular niche developed by encapsulating brain-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes in a gelatin hydrogel. We show that pericytes and astrocytes explicitly contribute to vascular architecture and maturation. We use co-cultures of patient-derived GBM tumor cells with brain microvascular cells to identify a role for pericytes and astrocytes in establishing a perivascular niche environment that modulates GBM cell invasion, proliferation, and therapeutic response. Engineered models provides unique insight regarding the spatial patterning of GBM cell phenotypes in response to a multicellular model of the perivascular niche. Critically, we show that engineered perivascular models provide an important resource to evaluate mechanisms by which inter- cellular interactions modulate GBM tumor cell behavior, drug response, and provide a framework to consider patient-specific disease phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) are a class of cancer drugs that enzymatically inhibit PARP activity at sites of DNA damage. In the context of BRCA mutations, PARPi can be synthetically lethal, presenting ideal genetic targeting. Yet, PARPi function primarily by trapping PARP1 onto sites of DNA damage. How PARPi trap and why some are better trappers remain unknown. Here, we show trapping occurs primarily through a kinetic phenomenon within biomolecular condensates that correlates with PARPi koff. Our results suggest PARP trapping is not the physical stalling of PARP1 on DNA, rather the high probability of PARP re-binding damaged DNA in the absence of other DNA binding protein recruitment. Furthermore, we found recruitment of the DNA binding protein RPA1 correlates to cell line PARPi sensitivity independent of RPA1 expression, demonstrating that condensate recruitment alone can impact efficacy. These results shed new light on how PARPi function, describe how PARPi properties correlate to trapping potency, and suggest previously unknown mechanisms of PARPi resistance.",

    "abstract": "Expression of the unconventional myosin, Myosin-1e (Myo1e), has been shown to contribute to tumor progression in the MMTV-PyMT mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis and is associated with poor outcome in breast cancer patients. However, the specific effects of Myo1e expression on the mammary tumor cells remain unidentified. Here, we used Myo1e-KO and wild-type (WT) MMTV-PyMT mice on a pure genetic background to further investigate the molecular and cellular effects of Myo1e expression. Myo1e-WT tumors were characterized by an increased abundance of intra-epithelial macrophages and lower amounts of the extracellular matrix. Transcriptomic profiling of WT and Myo1e-KO tumors identified a pattern of differential expression of tumor suppressor and tumor-promoting genes that was consistent with the observed differences in tumor progression and morphology between the genotypes, and also revealed differential expression of genes associated with secretion and cell-cell adhesion. In agreement with the RNA-seq findings, Myo1e-expressing tumor cells exhibited increased proliferation and elevated nuclear enrichment of YAP1 transcriptional activator compared to Myo1e-KO tumor cells. To investigate tumor cell-autonomous effects of Myo1e expression, we used the epithelial cell line PY-230 derived from the MMTV-PyMT-induced mouse tumor to create Myo1e-depleted cells by Crispr-mediated genome editing. Cells deficient in Myo1e had increased expression of genes encoding milk components compared to the wild-type cells. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) measurements showed that depletion of Myo1e in PY-230 cells resulted in increased resistance to electrical current indicating enhanced epithelial barrier function. Overall, we find that Myo1e expression biases tumors towards a less-differentiated, pro-tumorigenic state, and that depletion of Myo1e is associated with a pro-secretory, more differentiated state.",

    "abstract": "The proper balance of synthesis, folding, modification and degradation of proteins, also known as protein homeostasis, is vital to cellular health and function. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated when the mechanisms maintaining protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) become overwhelmed. However, prolonged or strong UPR responses can result in elevated inflammation and cellular damage. Previously, we discovered that the bifunctional enzyme Fic can modulate the UPR response via post-translational modification of BiP by AMPylation and deAMPylation. Loss of fic in Drosophila leads to vision defects and altered UPR activation in the fly eye. To investigate the importance of Fic-mediated AMPylation in a mammalian system, we generated a conditional null allele of Fic in mice and characterized the effect of Fic loss on the exocrine pancreas. Compared to controls, Fic-/- mice exhibit elevated serum markers for pancreatic dysfunction and display enhanced UPR signaling in the exocrine pancreas in response to physiologic and pharmacological stress. In addition, both fic-/- flies and Fic-/- mice show reduced capacity to recover from damage by stress that triggers the UPR. These findings show that Fic- mediated AMPylation acts as a molecular rheostat that is required to temper the UPR response in the mammalian pancreas during physiological stress.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent clinical arrhythmia, is associated with atrial remodeling manifesting as acute and chronic alterations in expression, function, and regulation of atrial electrophysiological and Ca2+-handling processes. These AF-induced modifications crosstalk and propagate across spatial scales creating a complex pathophysiological network, which renders AF resistant to existing pharmacotherapies that predominantly target transmembrane ion channels. Developing innovative therapeutic strategies requires a systems approach to disentangle quantitatively the proarrhythmic contributions of individual AF-induced alterations. Here, we built a novel computational framework for simulating electrophysiology and Ca2+-handling in human atrial cardiomyocytes and tissues, and their regulation by key upstream signaling pathways (i.e., protein kinase A, PKA, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, CaMKII) involved in AF-pathogenesis. Populations of atrial cardiomyocyte models were constructed to determine the influence of subcellular ionic processes, signaling components, and regulatory networks on atrial arrhythmogenesis. Our results reveal a novel synergistic crosstalk between PKA and CaMKII that promotes atrial cardiomyocyte electrical instability and arrhythmogenic triggered activity. Simulations of heterogeneous tissue demonstrate that this cellular triggered activity is further amplified by CaMKII-dependent alterations of tissue properties, further exacerbating atrial arrhythmogenesis. Our analysis positions CaMKII as a key nodal master switch of the adaptive changes and the maladaptive proarrhythmic triggers at the cellular and tissue levels and establishes CaMKII inhibition as potential anti-AF strategy. Collectively, our integrative approach is powerful and instrumental to assemble and reconcile existing knowledge into a systems network for identifying novel anti-AF targets and innovative approaches moving beyond the traditional ion channel-based strategy.\n\nSignificance statementDespite significant advancement in our understanding of pathological mechanisms and alterations underlying atrial fibrillation (AF), a highly prevalent clinical arrhythmia causing substantial health and socioeconomic burden, development of effective pharmacological therapeutics for AF remains an urgent unmet clinical need. We built a systems framework integrating key processes and their regulatory upstream signaling pathways that are involved in atrial electrophysiology and modified by AF. By simulating populations of single atrial cardiomyocyte models and heterogeneous tissues, our analysis demonstrated synergistic interactions between upstream signaling pathways that promote atrial arrhythmogenesis across spatial scales, added new insight into complex atrial arrhythmia mechanisms, and revealed adaptive and maladaptive alterations caused by AF, thus providing a powerful new tool for identifying innovative therapeutic approaches against AF.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe main mission of NIH-sponsored institutional training programs such as the T32 is to provide strong research and career training for early career scientists, while preparing those individuals to become leaders working to meet the health-related research needs of the nation. One of the main avenues to pursue health-related research is becoming research faculty at an academic institution. It is therefore important to know whether these programs are succeeding in this mission, or, if barriers exist that prevent trainees from pursuing these careers.\n\nMethodsOur institution currently trains ~ 2400 post-doctoral scholars per year, approximately 5% of whom are enrolled in one of our 33 T32 programs. In this study, we 1) compare the professional outcomes of T32 trainees with non-T32 trainees at our institution, and 2) survey past and current T32 trainees in a subset of high-performing cardiovascular programs about the barriers and enablers they experienced to pursuing research-oriented careers.\n\nResultsFormer T32 trainees are significantly more likely to attain appointments as primarily research faculty members, compared to other trainees. Trainees report a perceived lack of stability, the paucity of open positions, and the  publish or perish competitive mentality of academia as their top reasons for abandoning careers in academia. However, they were still more likely to choose research over clinical careers after participating in a dedicated T32 program.\n\nConclusionsOur results support the conclusion that structured training programs strengthen the pipeline of young scientists pursuing careers in academic research, including those from underrepresented backgrounds. However, T32 postdoctoral researchers are held back from pursuing academic careers by a perceived lack of stability and high competition for faculty positions.\n\nFundingThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing cells are a powerful modality of adoptive cell therapy against cancer. The strength and dynamics of signaling events initiated upon antigen binding depend on the costimulatory domain within the structure of the CAR. One such costimulatory domain is 4-1BB, which affects cellular response via the NF{kappa}B pathway. However, the quantitative aspects of 4-1BB-induced NF{kappa}B signaling are not fully understood.\n\nMethodsWe developed an ordinary differential equation-based mathematical model representing canonical NF{kappa}B signaling activated by CAR-4-1BB. We first performed a global sensitivity analysis on our model to quantify the impact of kinetic parameters and initial protein concentrations. We ran Monte Carlo simulations of cell population-wide variability in NF{kappa}B signaling and used Kraskovs algorithm to quantify the mutual information between the extracellular signal and different levels of the NF{kappa}B signal transduction pathway.\n\nResultsWe determined that in response to a wide range of antigen concentrations, the magnitude of the transient peak in the nuclear concentration of NF{kappa}B varies significantly, while the timing of this peak is relatively consistent. Our global sensitivity analysis showed that the model is robust to variations in parameter values, and thus, its quantitative predictions would remain applicable to a broad range of parameter values. Next, we found that overexpressing NEMO and disabling IKK{beta} deactivation are predicted to increase the mutual information between antigen levels and NF{kappa}B activation.\n\nConclusionsOur modeling predictions provide actionable insights to guide CAR development. Particularly, we propose specific manipulations to the NF{kappa}B signal transduction pathway that can fine-tune the response of CAR-4-1BB cells to the antigen concentrations they are likely to encounter.",

    "abstract": "Different strains of a microorganism growing in the same environment display a wide variety of growth rates and growth yields. We developed a coarse-grained model to test the hypothesis that different resource allocation strategies, corresponding to different compositions of the proteome, can account for the observed rate-yield variability. The model predictions were verified by means of a database of hundreds of published rate-yield and uptake-secretion phenotypes of Escherichia coli strains grown in standard laboratory conditions. We found a very good quantitative agreement between the range of predicted and observed growth rates, growth yields, and glucose uptake and acetate secretion rates. These results support the hypothesis that resource allocation is a major explanatory factor of the observed variability of growth rates and growth yields across different bacterial strains. An interesting prediction of our model, supported by the experimental data, is that high growth rates are not necessarily accompanied by low growth yields. The resource allocation strategies enabling high-rate, high-yield growth of E. coli lead to a higher saturation of enzymes and ribosomes, and thus to a more efficient utilization of proteomic resources. Our model thus contributes to a fundamental understanding of the quantitative relationship between rate and yield in E. coli and other microorganisms. It may also be useful for the rapid screening of strains in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.",

High demand for mAbs for different applications urges the development of rapid and reliable recombinant production platforms. Plants provide a quick and inexpensive system for producing recombinant mAbs. Moreover, when paired with an established platform for mAb discovery, plants can easily be tailored to produce mAbs of different isotypes against the same target. Here, we demonstrate that a hybridoma-generated mouse mAb against chitinase 1 (CTS1), an antigen from Coccidioides spp., can be biologically engineered for use with serologic diagnostic test kits for coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) using plant expression. The original mouse IgG was modified and recombinantly produced in plants as IgG and IgM isotypes with human kappa, gamma, and mu constant regions. The two mAb isotypes produced in plants were shown to maintain target antigen recognition to CTS1 using similar reagents as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Valley Fever diagnostic kits. As none of the currently approved kits provide antibody dilution controls, humanization of antibodies that bind to CTS1, a major component of the diagnostic antigen preparation, may provide a solution to the lack of consistently reactive antibody controls for Valley Fever diagnosis. Furthermore, our work provides a foundation for reproducible and consistent production of recombinant mAbs engineered to have a specific isotype for use in diagnostic assays.",

Still, their sensitivity to complexity decreased with age. Thus, encoding two opposite body sides has high cognitive costs in younger children and smaller or null costs in older children. We interpreted these results in terms of the enhancement of Working Memory (WM) and body knowledge with age. When WM increases, it paradoxically drives older children to apply their superior body knowledge and imitate  anatomically, producing side errors. Younger children are free from such interference because they still lack the necessary body knowledge and WM capacity. In conclusion, this study suggests that anatomical imitation becomes available in childrens cognitive repertoire from age nine due to increased body knowledge and WM capacity.\n\nResearch HighlightsO_LIThe analysis of error types uncovers/illustrates the role of working memory and body knowledge in imitation.\nC_LIO_LIAs an effect of little working memory capacity, younger children pay a cognitive cost to encode opposite body sides and make \"side errors\".\nC_LIO_LIImitation performance improves with age, but side errors paradoxically increase in frequency due to greater ability to master body knowledge bringing to anatomical imitation.\nC_LIO_LIAnatomical imitation is available in childrens cognitive repertoire from age 9, as an effect of the development of body knowledge and working memory capacity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "One of the most concerned problems in neuroscience is how neurons communicate and convey information through spikes. There is abundant evidence in sensory systems to support the use of precise timing of spikes to encode information. However, it remains unknown whether precise temporal patterns could be generated to drive output in the primary motor cortex (M1), a brain area containing ample recurrent connections that may destroy temporal fidelity. Here, we used a novel brain-machine interface that mapped the temporal order and precision of motor cortex activity to the auditory cursor and reward to guide the generation of precise temporal patterns in M1. During the course of learning, rats performed the \"temporal neuroprosthetics\" in a goal-directed manner with increasing proficiency. Precisely timed spiking activity in M1 was volitionally and robustly produced under this \"temporal neuroprosthetics\", demonstrating the feasibility of M1 implementing temporal codes. Population analysis showed that the local network was coordinated in a fine time scale as the overall excitation heightened. Furthermore, we found that the directed connection between neurons assigned to directly control the output (\"direct neurons\") was strengthened throughout learning, as well as connections in the subnetwork that contains direct neurons. Network models revealed that excitatory gain and strengthening of subnetwork connectivity transitioned neural states to a more synchronous regime, which improved the sensitivity for coincidence detection and, thus, the precision of spike patterns. Therefore, our results suggested the recurrent connections facilitate the implementation of precise temporal patterns instead of impairing them, which provided new perspectives on the fine-timescale activity and dynamics of M1.",

    "abstract": "The biological effects of lead (Pb) contamination have been reported in various species. There are no restrictions on the use of Pb products, including bullets, in the areas south of Hokkaido, Japan. Local governments have announced the presence of some Pb in the soil sediments of water bodies. Previous studies have confirmed the relationship between blood Pb level (BLL) and immune cells. This study was performed with the aim of clarifying the effect of Pb contamination on immune cells. In total, 170 Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) were captured, including a population in Tokyo Bay between November 2018 and April 2021 and a population in Mikawa Bay between January 2019 and April 2021. Linear regression analysis was performed with the white blood cell count (WBC), proportion of heterophils (Het), proportion of lymphocytes (Lym), ratio of heterophils and lymphocytes (H/L ratio), copy number of CD4 messenger RNA, and copy number of CD8 messenger RNA as the objective variables, and the BLL as the explanatory variable. The group with BLL < 1.0 g/dL had a significantly lower Het and higher Lym than that with BLL > 3.5 g/dL (P < 0.05). In addition, the group with BLL < 1.0 g/dL had a significantly lower H/L ratio than that with BLL > 3.5 g/dL. CD8 and WBC were higher in the group with the group with BLL range, from 1.0 to 3.5 g/dL than those in the group with BLL < 1.0 g/dL. This study suggests that the effect of Pb pollution on the immune cells of Black-headed Gulls is lower than some previous criteria values.",

    "abstract": "Malaria chemotherapy has been plagued by parasite resistance. Novel drugs must be continually explored for malaria treatment. Plasmodium falciparum requires host glucose for survival and proliferation. Protein involved in hexose permeation, P. falciparum hexose transporter 1 (PfHT1) is a potential drug target. We performed high throughput virtual screening of 21,352 small-molecule compounds against PfHT1. The stability of the lead compound complexes was evaluated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 nanoseconds. We also investigated the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and physiological characteristics of the compounds in accordance with Lipinksi rules for drug-likeness to bind and inhibit PfHT1. Molecular docking and free binding energy analyses were carried out using Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born and Surface Area (MMGBSA) solvation to determine the selectivity of the hit compounds for PfHT1 over the human glucose transporter (hGLUT1) orthologue. Five important compounds were identified: Hyperoside (CID5281643); avicularin (CID5490064); sylibin (CID5213); harpagoside (CID5481542) and quercetagetin (CID5281680). The compounds formed intermolecular interaction with the binding pocket of the target via conserved amino acid residues (Val314, Gly183, Thr49, Asn52, Gly183, Ser315, Ser317, and Asn48). The MMGBSA analysis of the complexes yielded high free binding energies. Four (CID5281643, CID5490064, CID5213, and CID5481542) of the identified compounds were found to be stable within the PfHT1 binding pocket throughout the 100 nanoseconds simulation run time. The four compounds demonstrated higher affinity for PfHT1 than the human major glucose transporter (hGLUT1). This investigation demonstrates the inhibition potential of sylibin, hyperoside, harpagoside, and avicularin against PfHT1 receptor. Robust preclinical investigations are required to validate the chemotherapeutic properties of the identified compounds.",
