    "abstract": "The Bub1 and BubR1 kinetochore proteins support proper chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint activity. Bub1 and BubR1 are paralogues with Bub1 being a kinase while BubR1 localizes the PP2A-B56 protein phosphatase to kinetochores in humans. Whether this separation of kinase and phosphatase activity is important is unclear as some organisms integrate both activities into one Bub protein. Here we engineer human Bub1 and BubR1 proteins integrating kinase and phosphatase activities into one protein and show that these do not support normal mitotic progression. A Bub1-PP2A-B56 complex can supports chromosome alignment but results in impairment of the checkpoint due to dephosphorylation of the Mad1 binding site in Bub1. Furthermore, a chimeric BubR1 protein containing the Bub1 kinase domain induces delocalized H2ApT120 phosphorylation resulting in reduction of centromeric hSgo2 and chromosome segregation errors. Collectively, these results argue that the separation of kinase and phosphatase activities within the Bub complex is required for balancing its functions in the checkpoint and chromosome alignment.",

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in FBN1. Patients with MFS notably suffer from aortic aneurysm and dissection. Despite considerable effort, animal models have proven to be poorly predictive for therapeutic intervention in human aortic disease. Using a \"humanised\" model system may be more appropriate in identifying new therapeutic targets. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells can be differentiated into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and recapitulate major features of MFS. We have screened 1,022 small molecules in our in vitro model, exploiting the highly-proteolytic nature of MFS-VSMCs, and identified 36 effective compounds. Further analysis identified GSK3{beta} as a recurring target in the compound screen. GSK3{beta} inhibition/knockdown did not ameliorate the proliferation defect in MFS-VSMCs but improved MFS-VSMC apoptosis and proteolysis. To conclude, we have identified GSK3{beta} as a novel target for MFS, forming the foundation for future work in MFS and other aortic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the calcium sensing-receptor (CaSR), causes familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1), a typically benign condition characterized by mild hypercalcemia. In contrast, homozygous mutation of this dimer-forming G-protein coupled receptor manifests as the lethal neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT). To investigate the mechanisms by which CaSR mutations lead to these distinct disease states, we engineered wild-type (WT) and an exon 5-deficient disease-causing mutation, and transfected expression constructs into human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. WT protein was mainly membrane-expressed whereas the mutant CaSR protein (mCaSR) was confined to the cytoplasm. Co-expression of WT CaSR directed mCaSR to the cell membrane. In assays of CaSR function, increases in extracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o) increased intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) in cells expressing WT CaSR while the response was reduced in cells coexpressingmutant and WT receptor. Untransfected cells or those expressing mCaSR alone, showed minimal, equivalent responses to increased [Ca2+]o. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed an association between mutant and wild-type CaSR. The affinity of the WT CaSR for calcium was three times greater than that of the heterodimer. The maximal functional response to [Ca]o was dependent on localization of CaSR to the membrane level and independent of homo- or heterodimerizations. In summary, these results suggest that heterodimerization of WT and mCaSR receptors, rescues the trafficking defect of the mutant receptors and also reduces the affinity of the WT-mutant heterodimer for [Ca]o. In contrast, the homozygous mutants do not produce functional receptors on cell membrane. These data indicate how substantial differences between signaling of hetero- and homodimeric mutants lead to profound differences in the severity of disease in heterozygous and homozygous carriers of these mutations.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates with elongated auditory organs, mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) are organised such that complex sounds are broken down into their component frequencies along the proximal-to-distal long (tonotopic) axis. Acquisition of frequency-specific morphologies at the appropriate positions along the chick cochlea, the basilar papilla (BP), requires that nascent HCs determine their tonotopic positions during development. The complex signalling within the auditory organ between the developing HC and its local niche along the axis is currently poorly understood. Here we apply NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) to reveal metabolic gradients along the tonotopic axis of the developing BP. Re-shaping these gradients during development, by inhibiting different branch points of cytosolic glucose catabolism, alters normal morphogen signalling and abolishes tonotopic patterning, normalising the graded differences in hair cell morphology along the BP. These findings highlight a causal link between morphogen signalling and metabolic reprogramming in specifying tonotopic identity in developing auditory HCs.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to surveys based on a few genes that often provide limited taxonomic resolution, transcriptomes provide a wealth of genomic loci that can resolve relationships among taxonomically challenging lineages. Diatoms are a diverse group of aquatic microalgae that includes important bioindicator species and many such lineages. One example is Nitzschia palea, a widespread species complex with several morphologically based taxonomic varieties, some of which are critical pollution indicators. Morphological differences among the varieties are subtle and phylogenetic studies on a few genes fail to resolve their evolutionary relationships. We conducted morphometric and transcriptome analyses of 10 Nitzschia palea strains to resolve the relationships among strains and taxonomic varieties. Nitzschia palea was resolved into three clades, one of which corresponds to a group of strains with narrow linear-lanceolate valves. The other morphological group recovered in the shape outline analysis was not monophyletic and consisted of two clades. Subsequent gene-tree concordance analyses and phylogenetic network estimations revealed patterns of incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow between intraspecific lineages. We detected reticulated evolutionary patterns among lineages with different morphologies and a resulting putative recent hybrid. Our study shows that phylogenomic analyses of many unlinked nuclear loci, complemented with morphometrics, can resolve complex evolutionary histories of recently diverged species complexes.",

    "abstract": "The Sc2.0 project is building a eukaryotic synthetic genome from scratch, incorporating thousands of designer features. A major milestone has been achieved with the assembly of all individual Sc2.0 chromosomes. Here, we describe the consolidation of multiple synthetic chromosomes using endoreduplication intercross to generate a strain with 6.5 synthetic chromosomes. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture and long-read direct RNA sequencing were performed on this strain to evaluate the effects of designer modifications, such as loxPsym site insertion, tRNA relocation, and intron deletion, on 3D chromosome organization and transcript isoform profiles. To precisely map \"bugs\", we developed a method, CRISPR Directed Biallelic URA3-assisted Genome Scan, or \"CRISPR D-BUGS\", exploiting directed mitotic recombination in heterozygous diploids. Using this method, we first fine-mapped a synII defect resulting from two loxPsym sites in the 3 UTR of SHM1. This approach was also used to map a combinatorial bug associated with synIII and synX, revealing a highly unexpected genetic interaction that links transcriptional regulation, inositol metabolism and tRNASerCGA abundance. \"Starvation\" for tRNASerCGA leads to insufficient levels of the key positive inositol biosynthesis regulator, Swi3, which contains tandem UCG codons. Finally, to expedite consolidation, we employed a new method, chromosome swapping, to incorporate the largest chromosome (synIV), thereby consolidating more than half of the Sc2.0 genome in a single strain.",

    "abstract": "Many transcription factors contain intrinsically disordered transcription activation domains (TADs), which mediate interactions with co-activators to activate transcription. Historically, DNA-binding domains and TADs have been considered as modular units, but recent studies have shown that TADs can influence DNA binding. We biophysically characterized the NF{kappa}B p50/RelA heterodimer including the RelA TAD and investigated the TADs influence on NF{kappa}B-DNA interactions. In solution the RelA TAD is disordered but compact, with helical tendency in two regions that interact with co-activators. The presence of the TAD increased the stoichiometry of NF{kappa}B-DNA complexes containing promoter DNA sequences with tandem {kappa}B recognition motifs by promoting the binding of NF{kappa}B dimers in excess of the number of {kappa}B sites. We measured the binding affinity of p50/RelA for DNA containing tandem {kappa}B sites and single {kappa}B sites. While the presence of the TAD enhanced the binding affinity of p50/RelA for all {kappa}B sequences tested, it increased the affinity for non-specific DNA sequences by over 10-fold, leading to an overall decrease in specificity for {kappa}B DNA sequences. Our results reveal a novel function of the RelA TAD in promoting binding to non-consensus DNA previously observed by in vivo studies of NF{kappa}B-DNA binding in response to strong inflammatory signals.",

Therefore, improving GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) stability is a major obstacle for drug development. We analyzed human GLP-1, DPP-4, and GLP-1 receptor structures and designed three GLP-1RAs, which were introduced into fusion protein fragments and changed in the overall conformation. This modification effectively prevented GLP-1RAs from entering DPP-4 active center without affecting GLP-1Ras ability to bind to GLP-1R, the new GLP-1RA hypoglycemic effect lasting for >24 h. Through molecular modeling, molecular dynamics calculation, and simulation, possible tertiary structure models of GLP-1RAs were obtained; molecular docking with DPP-4 and GLP-1R showed access to the fusion protein. The overall conformational change of GLP-1RAs prevented DPP-4 binding, without affecting GLP-1Ras affinity to GLP-1R. This study provides important drug design ideas for GLP-1RA development and a new example for application of structural biology-based protein design in drug development.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants from human to domestic or wild animals during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is posing great challenges to epidemic control. Clarifying the host range of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will provide instructive information for the containment of viral spillover. The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 is the key determinant of receptor utilization, and therefore amino acid mutations on S will probably alter viral host range. Here, in order to evaluate the impact of S mutations, we constructed 20 Hela cell lines stably expressing ACE2 orthologs from different animals, and prepared 27 pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 carrying different spike mutants, among which 20 bear single mutation and the other 7 were cloned from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including D614G, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.135), Lambda (B.1.429) and Mu (B.1.525). Using pseudoviral reporter assay, we identified that the substitutions of T478I and N501Y enabled the pseudovirus to utilize chicken ACE2, indicating potential infectivity to avian species. Furthermore, the S mutants of real SARS-CoV-2 variants comprising N501Y showed significantly acquired abilities to infect cells expressing mouse ACE2, indicating a critical role of N501Y in expanding SARS-CoV-2 host range. In addition, A262S and T478I significantly enhanced the utilization of various mammals ACE2. In summary, our results indicated that T478I and N501Y substitutions were two S mutations important for receptor adaption of SARS-CoV-2, potentially contributing to spillover of the virus to many other animal hosts. Therefore, more attention should be paid to SARS-CoV-2 variants with these two mutations.",

Here, we present biological insights by characterizing a sumoylation mimetic UBC9-fusion (mCS~UBC9) in comparison to its wild-type (mCUBC9). We observe that sumoylation promotes UBC9s stability, nuclear localization and is beneficial for cell survival. We identified EME1, the regulatory subunit of the structure-specific endonuclease EME1-MUS81, as S*UBC9 substrate and demonstrate EME1 and UBC9 sumoylation being advantageous for survival upon Camptothecin (CPT) exposure. Moreover, mCS~UBC9 expression enhances double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication upon CPT treatment, features assigned to the EME1-MUS81 complex2. EME1 and mCS~UBC9 co-localize in nucleolar repair-condensates, that enlarge and round when exposed to the drug. Together, these findings imply that S*UBC9-induced EME1 sumoylation improves ribosomal rDNA repair, which might prevent dangerous second template switches in highly repetitive ribosomal chromatin and allow the converging replication fork to complete DNA replication. Finally, we discuss implications of these findings for anti-cancer therapy.",

More effective antiviral medications are needed to curb the continued spread of this disease. The infection by SARS-COV-2 virus is initiated via the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral glycoprotein Spike (S protein) and the N-term peptidase domain (PD) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on host cell membrane. ACE2 forms protein homodimer primarily through its ferredoxin-like fold domain (aka. Neck-domain). We investigated whether the dimerization of ACE2 receptor plays a role in SARS-COV-2 virus infection. We report here that the ACE2 receptor dimerization enhances the recognition of SARS-COV-2 S protein. A 43 amino acid peptide based on the N-term of Neck-domain could block the ACE2 dimerization and the interaction between RBD and ACE2, and mitigate the SARS-COV-2/host cell interaction.

    "abstract": "The activity of a kinesin is largely determined by the ~350 residue motor domain and this region alone is sufficient to classify a kinesin as a member of a particular family. The Kinesin-13 family are a group of microtubule depolymerising kinesins and are vital regulators of microtubule length. Members of this family are critical to spindle assembly and chromosome segregation in both mitotic and meiotic cell division and play crucial roles in cilium length control and neuronal development. To better understand the evolution of microtubule depolymerisation activity in the Kinesin-13 family, we created a synthetic ancestral Kinesin-13 motor domain. This phylogenetically-inferred ancestral motor domain is the sequence predicted to have existed in the common ancestor of the Kinesin-13 family. Here we show that the ancestral Kinesin-13 motor depolymerises stabilised microtubules faster than any previously tested depolymerase. This potent activity is more than an order of magnitude faster than the most highly studied Kinesin-13, MCAK and allows the ancestral Kinesin-13 to depolymerise doubly-stabilised microtubules that are unaffected by MCAK. These data suggest that the ancestor of the Kinesin-13 family was a  super depolymeriser and that members of the Kinesin-13 family have evolved away from this extreme depolymerising activity to provide more controlled microtubule depolymerisation activity in extant cells.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimFunctional loss of paracellular tight junction (TJ) barrier of the gut epithelium and mutations in autophagy genes are factors potentiating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previously we showed the role of autophagy in enhancing the TJ barrier via claudin-2 degradation, however, its role in the regulation of the barrier-forming protein occludin remains unknown. Here, we investigate the role of autophagy in the regulation of occludin and its role in inflammation-mediated TJ barrier loss.\n\nMethodsPharmacological and genetic tools were used to study the effect of autophagy on occludin levels and localization, and the role of the MAPK pathway.\n\nResultsAutophagy induction using pharmacological activators and nutrient starvation increased total occludin levels in different epithelial cells. Starvation enriched membrane occludin levels and reduced paracellular inulin flux in Caco-2 cells. Starvation-induced TJ barrier enhancement was contingent on the presence of occludin as OCLN-/- nullified its TJ barrier enhancing effect. Autophagy inhibited the constitutive degradation of occludin and protected against inflammation-induced TJ barrier loss. Starvation-induced TJ barrier enhancement was prevented by inhibition of autophagy. Autophagy enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK-1/2. Inhibition of these kinases in Caco-2 cells and human intestinal mucosa inhibited the protective effects of autophagy. In-vivo, autophagy induction by rapamycin increased occludin levels in mouse intestines and protected against LPS and TNF--induced TJ barrier loss. Additionally, acute Atg7 knockout in adult mice decreased intestinal occludin levels, increasing baseline colonic TJ-permeability and exacerbating the effect of DSS-induced colitis.\n\nConclusionOur data suggest a novel role of autophagy in promoting the intestinal TJ barrier by increasing occludin levels in an ERK1/2 MAPK-dependent mechanism.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487876v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e08d0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c65f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9e393org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bcd65_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Among the novel mutations distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from similar respiratory coronaviruses is a K403R substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein within its S1 region. This amino acid substitution occurs near the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding interface and gives rise to a canonical RGD adhesion motif that is often found in native extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin. In the present study, the ability of recombinant S1-RBD to bind to cell surface integrins and trigger downstream signaling pathways was assessed and compared to RGD-containing, integrin-binding fragments of fibronectin. S1-RBD supported adhesion of both fibronectin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as primary human small airway epithelial cells. Cell adhesion to S1-RBD was cation- and RGD-dependent, and was inhibited by blocking antibodies against v and {beta}3, but not 5 or {beta}1, integrins. Similarly, direct binding of S1-RBD to recombinant human v{beta}3 and v{beta}6 integrins, but not 5{beta}1 integrins, was observed by surface plasmon resonance. Adhesion to S1-RBD initiated cell spreading, focal adhesion formation, and actin stress fiber organization to a similar extent as fibronectin. Moreover, S1-RBD stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the adhesion mediators FAK, Src, and paxillin, Akt activation, and supported cell proliferation. Together, these data demonstrate that the RGD sequence within S1-RBD can function as an v-selective integrin agonist. This study provides evidence that cell surface v-containing integrins can respond functionally to spike protein and raise the possibility that S1-mediated dysregulation of ECM dynamics may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences that have been highly successful at invading eukaryotic genomes. It is unclear how TE families reach high copy number given the expectation that some novel insertions will be deleterious. It has been hypothesized that TE families may evolve to target and insert into specific DNA sequences to adjust the underlying distribution of fitness effects for new insertions. Preferentially inserting into neutral sites could minimize the cumulative deleterious load of a TE family, allowing the mean TE copy number to increase with less risk for host population extinction. To test this hypothesis, we constructed simulations to explore how the transposition probability and insertion preference of a TE family influence the evolution of mean TE copy number and host population size, allowing for extinction. We find that extinction is most common in our simulations under high transposition probabilities, but, as we reduce transposition rates, the risk of extinction persists while the preference for neutral insertion sites is high. In the absence of mechanisms that regulate TE transposition, a preference for neutral insertion sites is not protective and, in fact, actively accelerates both an increase in TE copy number and the time to population extinction.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecium is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen that is exhibiting increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Many of the genes that confer resistance and pathogenic functions are localized on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which facilitate their transfer between lineages. Here, features including resistance determinants, virulence factors, and MGEs were profiled in a set of 1273 E. faecium genomes from two disparate geographic locations (in the UK and Canada) from a range of agricultural, clinical, and associated habitats. Neither lineages of E. faecium nor MGEs are constrained by geographic proximity, but our results show evidence of a strong association of many profiled genes and MGEs with habitat. Many features were associated with a group of clinical and municipal wastewater genomes that are likely forming a new human-associated ecotype. The evolutionary dynamics of E. faecium make it a highly versatile emerging pathogen, and its ability to acquire, transmit, and lose features presents a high risk for the emergence of new pathogenic variants and novel resistance combinations. This study provides a workflow for MGE-centric surveillance of AMR in Enterococcus that can be adapted to other pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Gangliosides are an indispensable glycolipid class concentrated on cell surfaces with a critical role in stem cell differentiation. Nonetheless, owing to the lack of suitable methods for scalable analysis covering the full scope of ganglioside molecular diversity, their mechanistic properties in signaling and differentiation remain undiscovered to a large extent. This work introduces a sensitive and comprehensive ganglioside assay based on liquid chromatography, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and multistage fragmentation. Complemented by an open-source data evaluation workflow, we provide automated in-depth lipid species-level and molecular species-level annotation based on decision rule sets for all major ganglioside classes. Compared to conventional state-of-the-art methods, the presented ganglioside assay offers (1) increased sensitivity, (2) superior structural elucidation, and (3) the possibility to detect novel ganglioside species. A major reason for the highly improved sensitivity is the optimized spectral readout based on the unique capability of two parallelizable mass analyzers for multistage fragmentation. In addition to the significant technological advance, we identified 263 ganglioside species including cell-state-specific markers and previously unreported gangliosides in native and differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells. A general increase of the ganglioside numbers upon differentiation was observed as well as cell-state-specific clustering based on the ganglioside species patterns. By proving the predictive power of gangliosides as ubiquitous cell state-specific markers, we demonstrated the high throughput universal capability of our novel analytical strategy, which comes with new insights on the biological role of gangliosides in stem cell differentiation. Our analytical workflow will pave the way for new ganglioside- and glycolipid-based clusters of differentiation markers to determine stem cell phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer with limited therapeutic options. In this study, we evaluated the impact of CDK4/6 inhibition by palbociclib in a panel of 28 MPM cell lines, including 19 patient-derived cell lines, using a variety of approaches including RNA-sequencing. Palbociclib used alone sufficed to strongly and durably inhibit the proliferation of 23 MPM cell lines, indicating a unique sensitivity of MPM to CDK4/6 inhibition. Importantly, insensitivity to palbociclib was mostly explained by the lack of active T172-phosphorylated CDK4. This was associated with the high p16INK4A (CDKN2A) levels that accompany RB1 defects or inactivation, and also (unexpectedly) cyclin E1 over-expression in the presence of wild-type RB1. Prolonged treatment with palbociclib irreversibly inhibited proliferation despite re-induction of cell cycle genes upon drug washout. A senescence-associated secretory phenotype including various potentially immunogenic components was also irreversibly induced. Phosphorylated CDK4 was detected in 80% of 47 MPM tumors indicating their intrinsic sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. The absence of this phosphorylation in some highly proliferative MPM tumors was linked to partial deletions of RB1, leading to very high p16 (CDKN2A) expression. Our study strongly supports the clinical evaluation of CDK4/6 inhibitory drugs for MPM treatment, in monotherapy or combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or pathological hepatic lipid overload, is considered to affect obese individuals. However, NAFLD in lean individuals is prevalent, especially in South Asian population. The pathophysiology of lean NAFLD is not well understood and most animal models of NAFLD use the high-fat diet paradigm. To bridge this gap, we have developed a diet-independent model of NAFLD in zebrafish. We have previously showed that chronic systemic inflammation causes metabolic changes in the liver leading to hepatic fat accumulation in an IL6 overexpressing (IL6-OE) zebrafish model. In the present study, we compared the hepatic lipid composition of adult IL6-OE zebrafish to the controls and found an accumulation of saturated triacylglycerols and a reduction in the unsaturated triacylglycerol species reminiscent of NAFLD patients. Zebrafish is an ideal system for chemical genetic screens. We tested whether the hepatic lipid accumulation in the IL6-OE is responsive to chemical treatment. We found that PPAR-gamma agonist Rosiglitazone, known to reduce lipid overload in the high fat diet models of NAFLD, could ameliorate the fatty liver phenotype of the IL6-OE fish. Rosiglitazone treatment reduced the accumulation of saturated lipids and showed a concomitant increase in unsaturated TAG species in our inflammation-induced NAFLD model. Our observations suggest that the IL6-OE model can be effective for small molecule screening to identify compounds that can reverse hepatic lipid accumulation, especially relevant to lean NAFLD.",

A recent study revealed that PPAR-dependent long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in modulating metabolic stress and inflammation in the livers of fasted mice. Here hepatic lncRNA 3930402G23Rik (G23Rik) was found to have active peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) within its promoter and is directly regulated by PPAR. Although G23Rik RNA was expressed to varying degrees in several tissues, the PPAR-dependent regulation of this lncRNA was only observed in the liver. Pharmacological activation of PPAR induced PPAR recruitment at the G23Rik promoter and a pronounced increase in hepatic G23Rik lncRNA expression. A G23Rik-null mouse line was developed to further characterize the function of this lncRNA in the liver. G23Rik-null mice were more susceptible to hepatic lipid accumulation in response to acute fasting. Histological analysis further revealed a pronounced buildup of lipid droplets and a significant increase in neutral triglycerides and lipids as indicated by enhance oil red O staining of liver sections. Hepatic cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acid, and triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in G23Rik-null mice and associated with induction of the lipid-metabolism related gene Cd36.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular instability and a blunted respiratory drive in hypoxic conditions, are hallmark features of the genetic sensory and autonomic neuropathy, familial dysautonomia (FD). FD results from a mutation in the gene ELP1, whose encoded protein is a scaffolding subunit of the six subunit Elongator complex. In mice, we and others have shown that Elp1 is essential for the normal development of neural crest derived-dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Whether Elp1 is also required for development of ectodermal placode-derived visceral sensory receptors which are required for normal baroreception and chemosensory responses, has not been investigated. Using mouse models for FD, our data indicate that in fact the entire circuitry underlying baroreception and chemoreception is impaired due to a requirement for Elp1 not only in the visceral sensory neuron ganglia, but also for normal peripheral target innervation, and in their CNS synaptic partners in the medulla. Thus Elp1 is required in both placode- and neural crest-derived sensory neurons and its reduction aborts the normal development of neuronal circuitry essential for autonomic homeostasis and interoception.\n\nSummary statementDue to faulty afferent sensory signaling, patients with Familial dysautonomia (FD) have a diminished sensory arm of the baroreflex which would normally modulate blood pressure, and they have a blunted response to hypoxia and hypercapnia (Norcliffe-Kaufmann et al. 2010). Using mouse models for FD, we reveal here the underlying pathology which may underlie these severely impaired homeostatic reflex pathways in FD.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocyte lineage cells interact with the vasculature in the gray matter. Physical and functional interactions between blood vessels and oligodendrocyte precursor cells play an essential role in both the developing and adult brain. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells have been shown to migrate along the vasculature and subsequently detach from it during their differentiation to oligodendrocytes. However, the association of mature oligodendrocytes with blood vessels has been noted since the discovery of this glial cell type almost a century ago and this interaction remains poorly explored. Here, we systematically investigated the extent of mature oligodendrocyte interaction with the vasculature in mouse. We found that ~17% of oligodendrocytes were in contact with blood vessels in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Contacts were made mainly with capillaries and sparsely with larger arterioles or venules. By combining light and serial electron microscopy, we demonstrated that oligodendrocytes are in direct contact with the vascular basement membrane, raising the possibility of direct signaling pathways and metabolite exchange with endothelial cells. During experimental remyelination in the adult, oligodendrocytes were regenerated and associated with blood vessels in the same proportion compared to control cortex, suggesting a homeostatic regulation of the vasculature-associated oligodendrocyte population. Based on the frequent and close association with blood vessels, we propose that vasculature-associated oligodendrocytes should be considered as an integral part of the vasculature microenvironment. This particular location could underlie specific functions of vasculature-associated oligodendrocytes, while contributing to the vulnerability of mature oligodendrocytes in neurological diseases.",

Here, we present a workflow for bacterial isolation and whole-genome sequencing from complex microbiota using open-source labware and the OpenTrons automated liquid handling robotics platform. Our approach circumvents the need for isolate screening (e.g., through 16S rDNA sequencing or mass spectrometry analyses) by reducing the costs of genome-sequencing to ~$10 per bacterium. Applying the workflow, we quantified genomic diversity within 45 bacterial species in the chimpanzee gut microbiota. Results revealed hotspots of recombination in bacterial genomes and elevated transmission of plasmids between distantly related bacterial species within individual chimpanzee hosts. This study develops and applies an approach for high-throughput bacterial isolation and genome sequencing, enabling population genetic analyses of bacterial strains within complex communities not currently possible with metagenomic data alone.",

    "abstract": "Microalgae are photosynthetic organisms, which are considered as a potential source for sustainable metabolite production. Furthermore, stress conditions can affect metabolite production. In this study, a meta-analysis of RNA-seq experiments was performed to evaluate the response of metabolite biosynthesis pathways in Dunaliella tertiolecta to abiotic stress conditions, including high light, nitrogen deficiency, and high salinity. The results indicated down-regulation of light reaction, photorespiration, tetrapyrrole, and lipid-related pathways in salt stress. In comparison to salt stress, nitrogen deficiency mostly induced light reaction and photorespiration metabolisms. The up-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, phosphoglucose isomerase, bisphosphoglycerate mutase, and glucose-6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase (involved in central carbon metabolism) was observed under salt, high light, and nitrogen stress conditions. Interestingly, the results indicated that the meta-genes (i.e., modules of genes strongly correlated) tended to be located in a hub of stress-specific PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) networks. Module enrichment of meta-genes PPI networks highlighted the cross talk between photosynthesis, fatty acids, starch, and sucrose metabolism under multiple stress conditions. Moreover, it was observed that the coordinated expression of the tetrapyrrole intermediated with meta-genes involved in starch biosynthesis. The results of the present study also showed that some pathways such as vitamin B6 metabolism, methane metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, and folate biosynthesis responded to different stress factors specifically. In conclusion, the results of this study revealed the main pathways underlying the abiotic stress responses for optimized metabolite production by the microalga Dunaliella in future studies. PRISMA check list was also included in the study.",
