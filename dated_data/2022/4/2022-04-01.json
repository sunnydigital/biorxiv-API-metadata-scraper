    "abstract": "Methionine residues are particularly sensitive to oxidation by reactive oxygen or chlorine species (ROS/RCS), leading to the appearance of methionine sulfoxide in proteins. This post-translational oxidation can be reversed by omnipresent protein repair pathways involving methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msr). In the periplasm of Escherichia coli, the enzymatic system MsrPQ, whose expression is triggered by the RCS, controls the redox status of methionine residues. Here we report that MsrPQ synthesis is also induced by copper stress via the CusSR two-component system, and that MsrPQ plays a role in copper homeostasis by maintaining the activity of the copper efflux pump, CusCFBA. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggest the metallochaperone CusF is the substrate of MsrPQ and our study reveal that CusF methionines are redox sensitive and can be restored by MsrPQ. Thus, the evolution of a CusSR-dependent synthesis of MsrPQ allows keeping copper homeostasis under aerobic conditions by maintenance of the reduced state of Met residues in copper-trafficking proteins.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYOur study investigates the interconnection between the copper stress response and the methionine redox homeostasis in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. We report that the copper-activation of the CusSR two-component system induces the expression of the periplasmic oxidized-protein repair system, MsrPQ. We demonstrate that MsrPQ is crucial for CusCFBA copper efflux pump activity under aerobic conditions as it maintains the periplasmic component CusF in its functional reduced form. Methionine emerges as a critical residue in copper trafficking proteins: however this naturally-selected advantage must be balanced by methionines high susceptibility to oxidation. Therefore the induction of MsrPQ by copper allows copper homeostasis under aerobic conditions, illustrating that E. coli has developed an integrated and dynamic circuit for sensing and counteracting stress caused by copper and oxidants, thus allowing bacteria to adapt to host cellular defences.",

    "abstract": "Marine sponges and their microbial symbiotic communities are rich sources of diverse natural products (NPs) that often display biological activity, yet little is known about their global distribution landscape and the symbionts that produce them. As the majority of sponge symbionts remain uncultured, it is a challenge to characterize their NP biosynthetic pathways, assess their prevalence within the holobiont and measure their diversity across sponge taxa and environments. Here, we explore the microbial biosynthetic landscapes of three sponge species from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. This dataset reveals striking novelty in its encoded biosynthetic potential, with less than 1% of the recovered gene cluster families (GCF) showing similarity to any characterized biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). When zooming in on the microbial communities of each sponge, we observed higher variability of both secondary metabolic and taxonomic profiles between sponge species than within species. Nonetheless, we also identified conservation of GCFs, with 20% of sponge GCFs being shared between at least two sponge species, and a true GCF core comprised of 6% of GCFs shared across all species. Within this functional core, we identified a set of widespread and diverse GCFs encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) that are potentially involved in the production of diversified ether lipids, as well as GCFs putatively encoding the production of highly modified proteusins. The present work contributes to the small, yet growing body of data characterizing NP landscapes of marine sponge symbionts, and to the cryptic biosynthetic potential contained in this environmental niche.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule characterization of protein-DNA dynamics provides unprecedented mechanistic details about numerous nuclear processes. Here, we describe a new method that rapidly generates single-molecule information for fluorescently tagged proteins isolated from nuclear extracts of human cells. This approach determines binding lifetimes (koff), events per second ([~]kon), positional dependence (specificity), and characterizes 1D diffusion along DNA. We demonstrated the wide applicability of this approach on three forms of DNA damage using seven native DNA repair proteins and two structural variants, including: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1), heterodimeric ultraviolet-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB), xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C protein (XPC), and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1). By measuring multiple fluorescent colors simultaneously, we additionally characterized the assembly and disassembly kinetics of multi-protein complexes on DNA. Thus, Single-Molecule Analysis of DNA-binding proteins from Nuclear Extracts (SMADNE) provides new insights about damage recognition and represents a universal technique that can be used to rapidly characterize numerous protein-DNA interactions.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWModels of adaptive radiation were originally developed to explain the early, rapid appearance of distinct modes of life within diversifying clades. Phylogenetic tests of this hypothesis have yielded limited support for temporally declining rates of phenotypic evolution across diverse clades, but the concept of an adaptive landscape that links form to fitness, while also crucial to these models, has received more limited attention. Using methods that assess the temporal accumulation of morphological variation and estimate the topography of the underlying adaptive landscape, I found evidence of an early partitioning of mandibulo-dental morphological variation in Carnivora (Mammalia) that occurs on an adaptive landscape with multiple peaks, consistent with classic ideas about adaptive radiation. Although strong support for this mode of adaptive radiation is present in traits related to diet, its signal is not present in body mass data or for traits related to locomotor behavior and substrate use. These findings suggest that adaptive radiations may occur along some axes of ecomorphological variation without leaving a signal in others and that their dynamics are more complex than simple univariate tests might suggest.",

    "abstract": "Camponotus floridanus ant colonies are comprised of a single reproductive queen and thousands of sterile female offspring that consist of two morphologically distinct castes: smaller minors and larger majors. Minors perform most of the tasks within the colony, including brood care and food collection, whereas majors have fewer clear roles and have been hypothesized to act as a specialized solider caste associated with colony defense. The allocation of workers to these different tasks depends on the detection and processing of local information including pheromones and other chemical blends such as cuticular hydrocarbons. We examined the electrophysiological responses to general odorants, cuticular extracts, and a trail pheromone in adult minor and major C. floridanus workers, revealing that the repertoire of social behaviors is positively correlated with olfactory sensitivity. Minors in particular display primarily excitatory responses to olfactory stimuli, whereas major workers respond primarily with inhibitory signals. The notable exception to this paradigm is that both minors and majors display robust, dose-dependent excitatory responses to conspecific, non-nestmate cuticular extracts. Moreover, while both minors and majors actively aggress non-nestmate foes, majors display significantly enhanced capabilities to rapidly subdue and kill opponents. Overall, our data suggest that C. floridanus majors do indeed represent a physiologically and behaviorally specialized soldier caste and support a model in which caste-specific olfactory sensitivity plays an important role in task allocation and the regulation of social behavior in ant colonies.\n\nSignificance StatementThe detection and odor coding of chemical cues are essential components of the collective behavior observed in eusocial ants. To better understand the interdependent relationship between olfactory sensitivity and the allocation of worker castes to the various tasks critical for the success of the colony, a series of behavioral assessments and an electrophysiological survey of the antennae comprising general odorants, cuticular extracts, and a trail pheromone were undertaken. These studies reveal the behavioral repertoire of minors and majors aligned with profound shifts in olfactory sensitivity and odor coding. Our data support the hypothesis that minors are multipotential workers with broad excitatory sensitivity, and majors are dedicated soldiers with a highly specialized olfactory system for the detection of non-nestmate foes.",

    "abstract": "Efflux is a common mechanism of resistance to antibiotics. We show that efflux itself promotes accumulation of antibiotic-resistance mutations (ARM). This phenomenon was initially discovered in a bacterial swarm where the linked phenotypes of high efflux and high mutation frequencies spatially segregated to the swarm edge, driven there by motility. We uncovered and validated a global regulatory network that connects high efflux to downregulation of specific DNA repair pathways even in non-swarming states. The efflux-DNA repair link was corroborated in a clinical  resistome database: genomes with mutations that increase efflux exhibit a significant increase in ARMs. Accordingly, efflux inhibitors decreased evolvability to antibiotic resistance. Swarms also revealed how bacterial populations serve as reservoir of ARMs even in absence of antibiotic selection pressure. High efflux at the edge births mutants that, despite compromised fitness, survive there because of reduced competition. This finding is relevant to biofilms where efflux activity is high.",

    "abstract": "When eukaryotic cells are killed by pathogenic microorganisms, damage-associated and pathogen-associated signals are generated that alert other cells of nearby danger. Bacteria can detect the death of their kin; however, how bacteria make threat assessments of cellular injury is largely unexplored. Here we show that polyamines released by lysed bacteria serve as damage-associated molecules in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In response to exogenous polyamines, Gac/Rsm and cyclic-di-GMP signaling is activated and intracellular polyamine levels increase. In the absence of a threat, polyamines are catabolized, and intracellular polyamines return to basal levels, but cells infected by bacteriophage increase and maintain intracellular polyamine levels, which inhibits phage replication. Phage species not inhibited by polyamines did not trigger polyamine accumulation by P. aeruginosa, suggesting polyamine accumulation and metabolism are targets in the phage-host arms-race. Our results suggest that like eukaryotic cells, bacteria can differentiate damage-associated and pathogen-associated signals to make threat assessments of cellular injury.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/486733v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f69334org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a4422org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f3edeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a86c43_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "In the search for structurally novel metabolites with antibacterial activity, innovative approaches must be implemented to increase the probability of discovering novel chemistry from microbial sources. Here we report on the application of metabolomic tools to the genus Actinoallomurus, a poorly explored member of the Actinobacteria. From examining extracts derived from 88 isolates belonging to this genus, we identified a family of cyclodepsipeptides acylated with a C20 polyketide chain, which we named allopeptimicins. These molecules possess unusual structural features, including several double bonds in the amino-polyketide chain and four non-proteinogenic amino acids in the octapeptide. Remarkably, allopeptimicins are produced as a complex of active and inactive congeners, the latter carrying a sulfate group on the polyketide amine. This modification is also a mechanism of self-protection in the producer strain. The structural uniqueness of allopeptimicins is reflected in a biosynthetic gene cluster showing a mosaic structure, with dedicated gene cassettes devoted to formation of specialized precursors and modular assembly lines related to those from different pathways.",

Sets of lines contrasting for the QTL on 7AL were developed which allowed for the validation and fine mapping of the 7AL QTL and for the identification of a previously described candidate gene, WHEAT ORTHOLOG OF APO1 (WAPO1). Using transgenic overexpression in both a low and a high SPS line, we provide a functional validation for the role of this gene in determining SPS also in hexaploid wheat. We show that the expression levels of this gene positively correlate with SPS in multiple MAGIC founder lines under field conditions as well as in transgenic lines grown in the greenhouse. This work highlights the potential use of WAPO1 in hexaploid wheat for further yield increases. The impact of WAPO1 and SPS on yield depends on other genetic and environmental factors, hence, will require a finely balanced expression level to avoid the development of detrimental pleiotropic phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Disease molecular complexity requires high throughput workflows to map disease pathways through analysis of vast tissue repositories. Great progress has been made in life sciences analytical technologies. To match the high throughput of these advanced analytical platforms, we have previously developed a multipurpose microplate sonicator, PIXUL, that can be used in multiple workflows to extract analytes from cultured cells and tissue fragments for various downstream molecular assays. And yet, the sample preparation devices, such as PIXUL, along with the downstream analytical capabilities have not been fully exploited to interrogate tissues because storing and sampling of such specimens remain, in comparison, inefficient. To mitigate this bottleneck, we have developed a low-cost user-friendly system, the CryoGrid, that consists of CryoBlock, thermometer/thermocouple, and QR coded CryoTrays to freeze and store frozen tissue fragments, and hand-held CryoCore tool for tissue sampling supported by iPad and Google apps to display tissues, direct coring and share metadata.\n\nRNA is one of the most studied analytes. There is a decades-long history of developing methods to isolate and analyze RNA. Still, the throughput of sampling and RNA extraction from tissues has not matched that of the high throughput transcriptome analytical platforms. To address this need, we have integrated the CryoGrid system with PIXUL-based methods to isolate RNA for gene-specific qPCR and genome-wide transcript analyses. TRIzol is commonly used to isolate RNA but it is labor-intensive, hazardous, requires fume-hoods, and is an expensive reagent. We developed a PIXUL-based TRIzol-free RNA isolation fast protocol that uses a buffer containing proteinase K (PK). Virtually every disease (and often therapeutic agents toxicity) is a systemic syndrome but often only one organ is examined. CryoGrid-PIXUL, integrated with either TRIzol or PK buffer RNA isolation protocols, yielded similar RNA profiles in a multiorgan (brain, heart, kidney and liver) mouse model of sepsis. Thus, RNA isolation using the CryoGrid-PIXUL system combined with the PK buffer offers an inexpensive user-friendly workflow to study transcriptional responses in tissues in health and disease as well as in therapeutic interventions.",
