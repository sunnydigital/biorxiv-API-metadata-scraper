    "abstract": "A novel bacterium, strain RR6T of the genus Halopseudomonas, was isolated from the sea sand from Paradip port area, India. Cells are Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, aerobic, non-sporulating and motile. The major cellular fatty acids of RR6T were C10:0 3OH, C12:0, C16:1 w7c/16:1 w6c, 18:1 w7c and/or 18:1 w6c and C16:0. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol (PG), diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), unidentified phospholipid (PL) and unidentified lipids (L1-L2). The genome size of the strain RR6 was 3.93 Mb. The genomic G+C content was 61.3%. Gene ontology study showed a significant fraction of genes were associated with biological processes (53%), followed by molecular function (36%) and cellular components (11%). Comparisons of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed 99.73 - 99.87 % sequence similarity with the closely related type strains of the genus Halopseudomonas. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) and average amino acid identity (AAI) of RR6T with reference strains of closely related species of the genus Halopseudomonas were below 95-96, and the corresponding in-silico DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values were below 70 %. A phylogenomic tree based on core genome analysis supported these results. Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of RR6T indicate that the strain represents a novel species of the genus Halopseudomonas and the name Halopseudomonas maritima sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RR6T (= NBRC 115418T = TBRC 15628T).",

    "abstract": "Prime editing (PE) has advantages for small insertion, deletion or point mutations without double-stranded DNA breaks. The 3-extension of pegRNAs could negatively affect its stability or folding and comprise the PE activity. Here we generated stem-loop PEs (sPEs) by adding stem-loop aptamers at the 3-terminal of pegRNA, which can be tethered to Cas9 nickase resulting in tethered PEs (tPEs). sPEs and tPEs increased the small insertion, deletion or point mutations efficiency by 2-4-fold on average in HEK293, U2OS and HeLa cells. We split the modified pegRNAs into sgRNA and prime RNA. The resulting split pegRNA prime editors (SnPEs) maintain the PE activity and increase flexibility.",

    "abstract": "While increasingly powerful approaches enable investigation of transcription using small samples of RNA, approaches to investigate translational regulation in small populations of specific cell types, and/or (sub)-cellular contexts are lacking. Comprehensive investigation of mRNAs actively translated into proteins from ultra-low input material would provide important insight into molecular machinery and mechanisms underlying many cellular, developmental, and disease processes in vivo. Such investigations are limited by the large input required for current state-of-the-art Ribo-seq. Here, we present an optimized, ultra-low input \"nanoRibo-seq\" approach using 102 - 103-fold less input material than standard approaches, demonstrated here in subtype-specific neurons. nanoRibo-seq requires as few as 2.5K neurons, and exhibits rigorous quality control features: 1) strong enrichment for CDS versus UTRs and non-CDS; 2) narrow, distinct length distributions over CDS; 3) ribosome P-sites predominantly in-frame to annotated CDS; and 4) sufficient ribosome-protected fragment (RPF) coverage across thousands of mRNAs. As proof-of-concept, we calculate translation efficiencies from paired Ribo-seq and alkaline fragmented control libraries from \"callosal projection neurons\" (CPN), revealing divergence between mRNA abundance and RPF abundance for hundreds of genes. Intriguingly, we identify substantial translation of upstream ORFs in the 5 UTRs of genes involved in axon guidance and synapse assembly. nanoRibo-seq enables previously inaccessible investigation of translational regulation by small, specific cell populations in normal or perturbed contexts.",

    "abstract": "The three-stranded chromatin structure R-loop is commonly found in the genomes of different species, and functions as the double-edged sword in gene expression and genome stability. The monoclonal antibody S9.6 specifically recognizes RNA:DNA hybrids, and has been widely used as a powerful tool to detect R-loops genome-widely. However, the structure basis and the molecular recognition mechanism of S9.6 to the nucleic acid substrates is still limited. Here, applying cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined a 4.9 [A] structure of S9.6 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) complexed with RNA:DNA hybrids. We found that the native Fab cleaved from S9.6 antibody has much higher affinity to RNA:DNA hybrids than to the double-strand RNAs, and the minimum length of the hybrids should be more than 8 base-pair. The structure of Fab binding to the hybrids suggested one loop of S9.6 heavy chain inserts into the minor groove in the RNA:DNA hybrids, and the other three loops flank to the hybrids. The top of four loop all enrich with aromatic or positive charge residues which are potentially responsible for nucleic acids binding specificity. Our results revealed the recognition mechanism of S9.6 on R-loops, which directs the future engineering of S9.6, and thus could further promote R-loop biology studies.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing of messenger RNAs is associated with the evolution of developmentally complex eukaryotes. Splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, and docking of the pre-mRNA 5 splice site into the spliceosome active site depends upon pairing with the conserved ACAGA sequence of U6 snRNA. In some species, including humans, the central adenosine of the ACAGA box is modified by N6 methylation, but the role of this m6A modification is poorly understood. Here we show that m6A modified U6 snRNA determines the accuracy and efficiency of splicing. We reveal that the conserved methyltransferase, FIO1, is required for Arabidopsis U6 snRNA m6A modification. Arabidopsis fio1 mutants show disrupted patterns of splicing that can be explained by the sequence composition of 5 splice sites and cooperative roles for U5 and U6 snRNA in splice site selection. U6 snRNA m6A influences 3 splice site usage and reinforces splicing fidelity at elevated temperature. We generalise these findings to reveal two major classes of 5 splice site in diverse eukaryotes, which display anti-correlated interaction potential with U5 snRNA loop 1 and the U6 snRNA ACAGA box. We conclude that U6 snRNA m6A modification contributes to the selection of degenerate 5 splice sites crucial to alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the major drivers that influence soil bacterial and fungal communities is essential to mitigate the impacts of human activity on vulnerable ecosystems, like those found on the Galapagos Islands. Located ~1000 km off the coast of Ecuador, the volcanically formed islands are situated within distinct oceanic currents, which provide seasonal weather patterns and unique microclimates within small spatial scales across the islands. Although much is known about the impacts of human activity, such as climate change and invasive plant species, on above ground biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands, little is known about the resident soil microbial communities and the drivers that shape these communities. Here, our goal was to investigate the bacterial and fungal communities found in soil located in three distinct microclimates: Mirador (arid), Cerro Alto (transition zone), and El Junco (humid), and associated with native and invasive plant types. At each site, we collected soil at three depths (rhizosphere, 5 cm, and 15 cm) associated with the invasive plant, Psidium guajava (guava), and native plant types. We determined that the sampling location (microclimate) was the strongest driver of both bacterial and fungal communities (74 and 38%, respectively), with additional minor but significant impacts from plant type and soil depth. This study highlights the continued need to explore microbial communities across diverse environments and demonstrates the weight of different abiotic and biotic factors impacting soil microbial communities across San Cristobal Island in the Galapagos archipelago.\n\nIMPORTANCE/SIGNIFICANCEHuman activity such as climate change, pollution, introduction of invasive species, and deforestation, poses a huge threat to biodiverse environments. Soil microbiota are an essential component to maintaining healthy ecosystems. However, a greater understanding of factors that alter these microbial communities is needed in order to find ways to mitigate and reverse the impacts imposed by human activity. The Galapagos Islands are a unique real-world laboratory, in that the islands biogeography and physical locations in the Pacific Ocean provide distinct microclimates within small geographic distances. Harnessing these distinct environments allowed us to investigate the influence of microclimates, soil depth, and vegetation cover on bacterial and fungal community composition.",

    "abstract": "Mango is an evergreen plant belonging to the genus Mangifera of the Anacardiaceae family. Genus Mangifera has 69 species of Mangifera around the world that are mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical countries, including India, Indonesia, the Malay Peninsula, Thailand, and South China. It is a popular tropical fruit known as the \"King of Tropical Fruits\". However, the study of the structure information of the complete chloroplast genome of Mangifera was microscopic, there was no report about the comparison of SSR, Ka/Ks, codons analysis and RNA editing, so in this study, we sequenced the 6 Mangifera samples and used three different ways to analyze the relationship of 6 species of Mangifera. Then we got some results, through the RNA editing and Ka/Ks calculating, we found the species could be divided into two groups, and the difference between the two groups was protein-coding gene ccsA. Moreover, all RNA editing occurred conversion of C to T and the gene ndhB had the most RNA editing sites in all species. In Ka/Ks analysis, the gene atpB, cemA, clpP, ndhD, petD, petB and ycf15 would be suffered from the positive selection after divergence. We also find the IR regions in these seven samples were very conservation through IR contraction and expansion and Sequence Divergence Analysis. Finally, we tried to confirm the relationship between 7 samples of Mangifera in Angiosperms in 3 different ways. Then we got that ML210 and MP090 had a closer relationship than others, MS796 had a closer relationship with ML210 and MP090 than others. At the same time, the method of phylogenetic analysis based on the gene ycf2 was not more accurate at the genus level than the method based on complete cp genome and proteincoding genes.",

    "abstract": "The origin recognition complex (ORC) binds throughout the genome to initiate DNA replication. In metazoans, it is still unclear how ORC is targeted to specific loci to facilitate helicase loading and replication initiation. Here, we performed immunoprecipitations coupled with mass spectrometry for ORC2 in Drosophila embryos. Surprisingly, we found that ORC2 associates with multiple subunits of the Nup107-160 subcomplex of the nuclear pore. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that, relative to all modENCODE factors, nucleoporins are among the most enriched factors at ORC2 binding sites. Critically, depletion of the nucleoporin Elys, a member of the Nup107-160 complex, results in decreased ORC2 loading onto chromatin. Depleting Elys also sensitized cells to replication fork stalling, which could reflect a defect in establishing dormant replication origins. Our work reveals a new connection between ORC, replication initiation and nucleoporins, highlighting a previously unrecognized function of nucleoporins in metazoan replication initiation.",

    "abstract": "Among the methods for protein structure prediction, which is important in biological research, AlphaFold2 has demonstrated astonishing accuracy in the 14th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14). The accuracy is close to the level of experimental structure determination. Furthermore, AlphaFold2 predicts three-dimensional structures and estimates the accuracy of the predicted structures. AlphaFold2 outputs two model accuracy estimation scores, pLDDT, and pTM, enabling the user to judge the reliability of the predicted structures. Original research of AlphaFold2 showed that those scores had good correlations to actual prediction accuracy. However, it was unclear whether we could select a structure close to the native structure when multiple structures are predicted for a single protein. In this study, we generated several hundred structures with different combinations of parameters for 500 proteins and verified the performance of the accuracy estimation scores of AlphaFold2. In addition, we compared those scores with existing accuracy estimation methods. As a result, pLDDT and pTM showed better performance than the existing accuracy estimation methods for AlphaFold2 structures. However, the estimation performance of relative accuracy of the scores was still insufficient, and the improvement would be needed for further utilization of AlphaFold2.",
