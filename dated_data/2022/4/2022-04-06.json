    "abstract": "Biochemical and structural analyses of purified proteins are essential for the understanding of their properties. However, many proteins are unstable and difficult to purify, hindering their characterization. The B2 proteins of the lasso peptide biosynthetic pathways are cysteine proteases that cleave precursor peptides during the maturation process. The B2 proteins are poorly soluble and no experimentally-solved structures are available. Here, we performed a rabid semi-comprehensive mutational analysis of the B2 protein from the thermophilic actinobacterium, Thermobifida fusca (TfuB2) using a cell-free transcription/translation system, and compared the results with the structure prediction by AlphaFold2. Analysis of 34 TfuB2 mutants with substitutions of hydrophobic residues confirmed the accuracy of the predicted structure, and revealed a hydrophobic patch on the protein surface, which likely serves as the binding site of the partner protein, TfuB1. Our results suggest that the combination of rapid cell-free mutant analyses with precise structure predictions can greatly accelerate structure-function research of proteins for which no structures are available.",

    "abstract": "Inexpensive DNA sequencing has led to a rapidly increasing number of whole genome sequences in the public domain. Natural sequence variation can now be assessed across a large number of sequenced strains of a bacterial species, resulting in the definition of the wild-type alleleome (the collection of alleles for every gene found in the species). Concurrently, laboratory evolution emerged as a new approach to address biological questions and to develop new phenotypic traits, and a large number of laboratory acquired mutations can be found in databases. The availability of this large-scale sequence variation data now allows for a detailed comparison of mutations fixed in natural versus laboratory evolutions. Such comparison shows that laboratory-acquired mutations are rarely found in the wild-type alleleome of Escherichia coli. The E. coli alleleome is highly conserved as most of the sequence variation is concentrated in about 2% of the coding region. We find that there are typically two alternate amino acids coded for in the variable locations, and switches between the two are found in the data sets. Finally, we find that adaptive laboratory mutations, unlike wild-type mutations, do not utilize the redundancy built into the genetic code: they are less likely to be synonymous and rely on changing a single nucleotide in a codon. However, the uniqueness of mutations fixed in laboratory evolutions bodes well for synthetic biology by revealing novel exploitable sequence space untouched by natural evolution.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of precision engineering for crop trait improvement is important in the face of rapid population growth, climate change, and disease. To this end, targeted double-stranded break technology using RNA-guided Cas9 has been adopted widely for genome editing in plants. Agrobacterium or particle bombardment-based delivery of plasmids encoding Cas9 and guide RNA (gRNA) is common, but requires optimization of expression and often results in random integration of plasmid DNA into the plant genome. Recent advances have described gene editing by the delivery of Cas9 and gRNA as pre-assembled ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into various plant tissues, but with moderate efficiency in resulting regenerated plants. In this report we describe significant improvements to Cas9-RNP mediated gene editing in wheat. We demonstrate that Cas9-RNP assays in protoplasts are a fast and effective tool for rational selection of optimal gRNAs for gene editing in regenerable immature embryos (IEs), and that high temperature treatment enhances gene editing rates in both tissue types. We also show that Cas9-mediated editing persists for at least 14 days in gold particle bombarded wheat IEs. The regenerated edited wheat plants in this work are recovered at high rates in the absence of exogenous DNA and selection. With this method, we produce knockouts of a set of three homoeologous genes and two pathogenic effector susceptibility genes that result in insensitivity to corresponding necrotrophic effectors produced by Parastagonospora nodorum. The establishment of highly efficient, DNA-free gene editing technology holds promise for accelerated trait diversity production in an expansive array of crops.",

    "abstract": "Reproducibility is the cornerstone of scientific experiments. Assessing the reproducibility of an experiment requires analyzing the contribution of different factors to the variation of the observed data. Suitable data structures need to be defined prior to the data collection effort so that data associated with these factors can be recorded and associated with observations of the variable of interest. The resulting datasets can be analyzed statistically to estimate the effect of experimental factors on the observed data using ANOVA models. Custom data structures to document the execution of experimental workflows are defined in a research data management system. The data produced by multiple repetitions of a plasmid purification process and a cell culture process are analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis H-test to identify factors contributing to their variation. Repetitions of the plasmid purification process do not lead to significant differences in extraction yields. Statistically significant differences in plasmid solution purity are identified but the differences are small enough that are not biologically relevant. The maintenance of two cell lines over many generations leads to similar datasets. However, different media preparations appear to influence the variation of cell viability and harvested cell counts in unexpected ways that may be the indirect expression of hidden effects not captured in the data structure.",

Here, we aimed to investigate the structural basis for how FAK FAT binds to Talin and MBD2, which were previously reported to be cytoplasmic and nuclear ligands, respectively. Using several biophysical methods with purified recombinantly expressed protein constructs, we failed to observe measurable interactions between FAT and either the Talin FERM domain or MBD2.

    "abstract": "The first critical step in a viruss infection cycle is attachment to its host. This interaction is precise enough to ensure the virus will be able to productively infect the cell, but some flexibility can be beneficial to enable co-evolution and host range switching or expansion. Like many bacterial viruses, bacteriophage Sf6 utilizes a two-step process to recognize and attach to its host, Shigella flexneri. Sf6 first recognizes the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure of S. flexneri, then binds to either outer membrane protein (Omp) A or OmpC. This phage typically infects serotype Y strains but can also form small, turbid plaques on serotype 2a2 with greatly reduced plating efficiency, suggesting inefficient infection. To examine the interactions between Sf6 and this sub-optimal host, phage were experimentally evolved using mixed populations of S. flexneri serotypes Y and 2a2. The recovered mutants could infect serotype 2a2 with greater efficiency than the ancestral Sf6, forming clear plaques on both serotypes. All mutations mapped to two distinct regions of the tailspike protein: 1) adjacent to, but not part of, the LPS binding site near the N-terminus; and 2) at the distal, C-terminal tip of the protein. Rather than weak interactions between the Sf6 tailspike and 2a2 O-antigen, LPS of this serotype appears to inhibit infection by binding the wild-type particles more strongly, effectively removing them from the environment. These mutations reduce the inhibitory effect by either reducing electrostatic interactions with the O-antigen or increasing reliance on the Omp secondary receptors.",

    "abstract": "To perform genetic transformation, one of the three main Horizontal Gene Transfer mechanisms leading to virulence and antibiotic resistance genes acquisition, bacteria need to enter a physiological differentiated state called natural competence. Diverse environmental and cellular cues have been shown to trigger complex regulatory pathways ultimately activating central competence regulators controlling the expression of the genetic transformation genes. Interestingly, new bacteria displaying such aptitude are often discovered, and one of the latest is the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. However, a clear understanding of the environmental signals, regulatory pathways and central regulators involved in the development of competence in S. aureus is not yet available.\n\nHere, using an original optimized protocol to naturally induce competence in planktonic cells, leading to improved transformation efficiencies (up to 5.10-6), we showed that the three putative central competence regulators identified in S. aureus are all essential for a complete development of competence. We also found that genes involved in genetic transformation can be divided in several classes depending on the regulators controlling their expression. In addition, we showed that oxygen availability is an important signal leading to competence development through the induction of one of the three central regulators. Our results demonstrate the complexity of competence development in S. aureus, in comparison to other historical model organisms. We anticipate our findings to be a starting point for proving the importance of natural competence and genetic transformation for S. aureus genomic plasticity. Furthermore, we also believe that our data will allow us to elucidate the environmental conditions leading to antibiotic resistance acquisitions in vivo, in this important human pathogen.\n\nIntroductory paragraphStaphylococcus aureus has become over the years an important public health concern, due to a large range of infections and the emergence of outbreaks associated to antibiotic multi-resistant strains. S. aureus remarkable adaptive powers have been acquired through the acquisition of new genetic sequences, thanks to Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). The recent demonstration of the capacity of S. aureus to induce natural competence for genetic transformation prompted scientists to investigate this important mode of HGT in this new model organism in the field. Few key reports have already established that the development of competence in S. aureus might be complex, involving several potential master regulators, activated in response to multiple environmental signals and regulatory pathways.\n\nIn this study, we deciphered, thanks to the design of an optimized protocol, the complexity of the regulatory pathways leading to the development of competence as well as its true potential for S. aureuss genomic plasticity in vivo. In addition, we clearly demonstrated that natural competence develops in response to oxygen limitation, a key environmental signal for a facultative anaerobe organism such as S. aureus.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are structurally organized via the formation of multiple loops that create gene expression regulatory units called topologically associating domains (TADs). Here we revealed the KSHV TAD structure at 500 base pair resolution and constructed a 3D KSHV genomic structural model with 2kb binning. The latent KSHV genome formed very similar genomic architectures in three different naturally infected PEL cell lines and in an experimentally infected epithelial cell line. The majority of the TAD boundaries were occupied by CTCF and SMC1, and the KSHV transactivator was recruited to these sites during reactivation. Triggering KSHV gene expression decreased pre-wired genomic loops within the regulatory unit, while contacts extending outside of regulatory borders increased, leading to formation of a larger regulatory unit with a shift from repressive to active compartments (B to A). The 3D genomic structural model proposes that the immediate-early promoter region is localized on the periphery of the 3D viral genome during latency, while highly inducible non-coding RNA regions moved toward the inner space of the structure, resembling the configuration of a \"bird cage\" during reactivation. The compartment-like properties of viral episomal chromatin structure and its reorganization during the transition from latency may help coordinate viral gene transcription.\n\nImportanceThe 3D architecture of chromatin allows for efficient arrangement, expression, and replication of genetic material. The genomes of all organisms studied to date have been found to be organized through some form of tiered domain structures. However, the architectural framework of the genomes of large double-stranded DNA viruses such as the herpesvirus family has not been reported. Prior studies with Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) have indicated that the viral chromatin shares many biological properties exhibited by the host cell genome, essentially behaving as a mini human chromosome. Thus, we hypothesized that the KSHV genome may be organized in a similar manner. In this report, we describe the domain structure of the latent and lytic KSHV genome at 500 base pair resolution and present a 3D genomic structural model for KSHV under each condition. These results add new insights into the complex regulation of the viral lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "We are frequently exposed to bacterial genotoxins, such as cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), a prevalent heterotrimeric toxin whose active moiety is its CdtB subunit. CdtB triggers potent DNA damage, predisposing factors in the development of cancers, in host cells. CDT from Helicobacter hepaticus, a mouse pathogen, was shown to be directly involved in the development of murine hepatocarcinoma. Preliminary studies have shown that CDT induces certain phenotypes reminiscent of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which cells lose their epithelial characteristics in favor of mesenchymal ones, conducive to cell motility. In the present study, we investigated the different steps of EMT using liver tissues of mice infected with H. hepaticus, as well as human epithelial cell lines and xenograft mouse models following H. hepaticus CdtB expression. Most of the different steps of the EMT process were reproduced throughout the studied models. Indeed, microarray data showed a CdtB- dependent regulation of EMT-related transcripts. The key transcriptional regulators of EMT (SNAIL1 and ZEB1) and EMT markers (Vimentin, Fibronectin and 5{beta}1 integrin) were upregulated both at RNA and protein levels in response to CdtB. It also induced cell-cell junctions disassembly, causing individualization of cells and acquisition of a spindle-like morphology. CdtB activated the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteases and increased cell motility. This study demonstrated that CDT/CdtB elicits EMT process activation, supporting the idea that infection with genotoxin-producing bacteria can promote malignant transformation.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487255v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f94756org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ba7d59org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b80ccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@44d56d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Author SummaryWe are frequently exposed to infection with genotoxin--producing bacterial from the gut microbiota, such as cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). CDT, via its active CdtB subunit, causes severe DNA damage in host cells, well-known risk factor of cancer development and progression. Chronic infection with CDT-producing bacteria is thus involved in cancer development. CDT is widespread among many bacteria and its impact in human cancer seems likely underestimated. Despite its major significance, CDT remains little studied. Here, we showed that cells exposed to CdtB are no longer cohesive, become individualized and acquire a spindle-shaped morphology known to be conducive to migration. These cells also express increased level of mesenchymal markers, as well as increased level of SNAIL1 and ZEB1, two key transcription factors orchestrating a crucial mechanism for cancer initiation and progression: epithelial to mesenchymal transition. These effects induced by CdtB were associated with increased matrix metalloproteinases degrading activity and emergence of cellular motility. Collectively, these data showed that CdB activates epithelial to mesenchymal transition, supporting the role of CDT in tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The ability to conduct reverse genetic studies in symbiotic systems is enabled by transgene expression and transformation of at least one partner. The symbiotic relationship between the yellow spotted salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, and the green alga, Oophila amblystomatis, is a unique model of vertebrate-algae symbiosis. Despite over 130 years of scientific study, there are still many open questions in this symbiosis. Transgene expression in one partner will accelerate research into the symbiotic relationship. In this paper we describe a tool and method for expression of foreign DNA in, and presumed transformation of, the alga O. amblystomatis. We successfully introduced heritable antibiotic resistance to algal cultures, and observed expression of a green fluorescent reporter protein in all transfected and presumably transformed algal populations. The outcomes of this work enable genetic manipulation of the symbiotic alga Oophila amblystomatis, allowing direct testing of hypotheses derived from gene expression or genomic studies that will usher in a deeper understanding of the A. maculatum-O. amblystomatis symbiotic system.\n\nSummary statementGenetic tools stimulate new possibilities for research in living systems.

    "abstract": "Parthanatos is a significant molecular cause of Parkinsons disease, in which AIMP2 aberrantly activates PARP-1 through a physical interaction. Interestingly, AIMP2 has an antagonistic splice variant, named DX2, which compromises AIMP2-induced apoptosis via p53 or inflammatory pathway. Here we suggested that DX2 binds to PARP-1 with a higher affinity than AIMP2, deactivating it and improving synaptic physiology. To deliver DX2 into deep brain areas, miR142 target sequence-embedded adeno-associated virus was designed to avoid unexpected expression in hematopoietic cells. RNAseq analysis revealed that DX2 selectively suppressed cell death-associated pathways, such as p53 and neuroinflammation. Upon a single intracranial injection, both behaviour and motility were mitigated in three animal models of Parkinsonism, induced by MPTP, rotenone, or 6-OHDA. Efficacy was observed in therapeutic model as well as preventive ones. Thus, AIMP2 and DX2 are suggested to act as an  ON/OFF switch for PARP-1. In particular, as cell survival properties of DX2 was exerted only when AIMP2 is accumulated abnormally, without its own additional tumorigenicity, DX2 could be a unique therapeutic tool for treating patients with Parkinsons disease.",

It is now clear that the preservation of insects cannot rely solely on the legal protection of natural areas far removed from the densest areas of human habitation. Instead, a critical challenge moving forward is to intelligently manage areas that include intensively farmed landscapes, such as the Central Valley of California. Here we attempt to meet this challenge with a tool for modeling landscape connectivity for insects (with pollinators in particular in mind) that builds on available information including lethality of pesticides and expert opinion on insect movement. Despite the massive fragmentation of the Central Valley, we find that connectivity is possible, especially utilizing the restoration or improvement of agricultural margins which (in their summed area) exceed natural areas. Finally, we highlight steps moving forward and the great many knowledge gaps that could be addressed in the field to improve future iterations of our modeling approach.",

    "abstract": "Predation is a powerful selective force shaping many behavioural and morphological traits in prey species. The deflection of predator attacks from vital parts of the prey usually involves the coordinated evolution of prey body shape and colour. Here, we test the deflection effect of hindwing tails in the swallowtail butterfly Iphiclides podalirius. In this species, hindwings display long tails associated with a conspicuous colour pattern. By surveying the wings within a wild population of I. podalirius, we observed that wing damage was much more frequent on the tails. We then used a standardised behavioural assay employing dummy butterflies with real I. podalirius wings to study the location of attacks by great tits Parus major. Wing tails and conspicuous coloration of the hindwings were struck more often than the rest of the body by birds. Finally, we characterised the mechanical properties of fresh wings and found that the tail vein was more fragile than the others, suggesting facilitated escape ability of butterflies attacked at this location. Our results clearly support the deflective effect of hindwing tails and suggest that predation is an important selective driver of the evolution of wing tails and colour pattern in butterflies.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have documented a strong intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. In explaining this transmission, separate fields of research have studied separate mechanisms. To obtain a more complete understanding, the current study integrates insights from the fields of behavioural sciences and genetics and examines the extent to which factors from each field are unique underlying mechanisms, correlate with each other, and/or act as important confounders in the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. Specifically, we focus on paternal involvement as our behavioural indicator and childrens polygenic score (PGS) for education as our genetic indicator and assess the role that fathers play in the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. To answer our research questions, we use rich data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n=4,579). Firstly, results from our mediation analyses showed that about 4 per cent of the effect of fathers educational attainment on childrens educational attainment is explained by paternal involvement, whereas a much larger share, 21 per cent, is explained by childrens education PGS. Secondly, our results showed that these genetic and behavioural influences are significantly correlated to each other. Thirdly, we found support for genetic confounding, as adding childrens education PGS to the model reduced the effect of paternal involvement by 11 per cent. Fourthly, evidence for social confounding was almost negligible (a reduction of half a per cent of the genetic effect). Our findings highlight the importance of integrating insights and data from multiple disciplines in understanding the mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of inequality, as our study reveals that behavioural and genetic influences overlap, correlate, and confound each other as mechanisms underlying this transmission.",

    "abstract": "Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a well-documented target for cancer therapeutics due to its role in B-cell signaling pathways. However, inhibitor design is hindered by lack of tools to assess kinase activity. We used in vitro phosphoproteomics to determine BTKs substrate preferences and applied this information to our updated data processing pipeline, KINATEST-ID 2.1.0. This pipeline generates a position-specific scoring matrix for BTK and a list of candidate synthetic substrates, each given a score. Characterization of selected synthetic substrates demonstrated a correlation between KINATEST-ID 2.1.0 score and biochemical performance in in vitro kinase assays. Additionally, by incorporating a known terbium-chelation motif, we adapted synthetic substrates for use in an antibody-free time-resolved terbium luminescence assay. This assay has applications in high-throughput inhibitor screening.",

    "abstract": "Repair of DNA damage is critical to genomic integrity and frequently disrupted in cancers. USP1, a nucleus-localized deubiquitinase, lies at the interface of multiple DNA repair pathways and is a promising drug target for certain cancers. Although multiple inhibitors of this enzyme, including one in phase I clinical trials, have been established, their binding mode is unknown. Here we use cryo-Electron Microscopy to study an assembled enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex of USP1 and the well-established inhibitor, ML323. Achieving 2.5 [A] resolution, we discover an unusual binding mode in which the inhibitor displaces part of the hydrophobic core of USP1. The consequent conformational changes in the secondary structure lead to subtle rearrangements in the active site that underlie the mechanism of inhibition. These structures provide a platform for structure-based drug design targeting USP1.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUSP1, a cancer target, is inhibited by ML323 displacing part of the protein fold, allosterically disrupting the active site.",

    "abstract": "Ventricular diastolic mechanical properties are important determinants of cardiac function and are optimized by changes in cardiac structure and physical properties. Oncorhynchus masou masou is an anadromous migratory fish of the Salmonidae family, and several ecological studies on it have been conducted; however, the cardiac functions of the fish are not well known. Therefore, we investigated ventricular diastolic function in landlocked (masu salmon) and sea-run (cherry salmon) types at 29-30 months post fertilization. Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography showed that the atrioventricular inflow waveforms of cherry salmon were biphasic with early diastolic filling and atrial contraction, whereas those of masu salmon were monophasic with atrial contraction. In addition, end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship analysis revealed that the dilatability per unit myocardial mass of the ventricle in cherry salmon was significantly suppressed compared to that in masu salmon, suggesting that the ventricle of the cherry salmon was relatively stiffer (relative ventricular stiffness index; p = 0.0263). Contrastingly, the extensibility of cardiomyocytes, characterized by the expression pattern of Connectin isoforms in their ventricles, was similar in both types. Histological analysis showed that the percentage of the collagen accumulation area in the compact layer of cherry salmon increased compared with that of the masu salmon, which may contribute to ventricle stiffness. Although the heart mass of cherry salmon was about 11-fold greater than that of masu salmon, there was no difference in the morphology of the isolated cardiomyocytes, suggesting that the heart of the cherry salmon grows by cell division of cardiomyocytes, but not cell hypertrophy. The cardiac physiological function of the fish varies with differences in their developmental processes and life history. Our multidimensional analysis of the O. maosu heart may provide a clue to the process by which the heart acquires a biphasic blood-filling pattern, i.e., a ventricular diastolic suction.",
