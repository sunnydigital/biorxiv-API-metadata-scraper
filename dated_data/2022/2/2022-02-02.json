    "abstract": "Machine learning models have difficulty generalizing to data outside of the distribution they were trained on. In particular, vision models are usually vulnerable to adversarial attacks or common corruptions, to which the human visual system is robust. Recent studies have found that regularizing machine learning models to favor brain-like representations can improve model robustness, but it is unclear why. We hypothesize that the increased model robustness is partly due to the low spatial frequency preference inherited from the neural representation. We tested this simple hypothesis with several frequency-oriented analyses, including the design and use of hybrid images to probe model frequency sensitivity directly. We also examined many other publicly available robust models that were trained on adversarial images or with data augmentation, and found that all these robust models showed a greater preference to low spatial frequency information. We show that preprocessing by blurring can serve as a defense mechanism against both adversarial attacks and common corruptions, further confirming our hypothesis and demonstrating the utility of low spatial frequency information in robust object recognition.",

    "abstract": "Humans automatically infer higher-order relationships between events in the environment from their statistical co-occurrence, often without conscious awareness. Neural replay of task representations, which has been described as sampling from a learned transition structure of the environment, is a candidate mechanism by which the brain could use or even learn such relational information in the service of adaptive behavior. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling revealed that participants acquired multi-step transition knowledge through gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model, although half of participants did not indicate any knowledge about the sequential task structure. To investigate neural replay, we analyzed dynamics of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns during short pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task. Evidence for sequential replay consistent with the probabilistic task structure was found in occipito-temporal and sensorimotor cortices during short on-task intervals. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task, and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay.",

    "abstract": "Animals use prior experience to assign absolute (good or bad) and also relative (better or worse) value to new experience. These learned values guide appropriate later decision-making. While our understanding of how the dopaminergic system computes absolute value is relatively advanced, the mechanistic underpinnings of relative valuation are unclear. Here we reveal mechanisms of absolute and relative aversive valuation in Drosophila. Three types of punishment-sensitive dopaminergic neurons (DANs) drive intensity-scaled plasticity at their respective mushroom body output neuron (MBON) connections to code absolute aversive value. In contrast, by comparing current and previous aversive experiences the MBON-DAN network can code relative aversive value by recruiting a specific subtype of reward-coding dopaminergic neurons which assigns a  better than value to the lesser of two aversive experiences. This study therefore provides an important functional consequence of having opposing populations of DANs and illustrates how these can operate together as a system within the MB network to code and compare sequential aversive experience to learn relative aversive value.",

    "abstract": "Sodium present in NaCl is a fundamental nutrient required for many physiological processes. In animals including Drosophila low-salt concentrations induce attraction and high-salt concentrations evoke aversive behavior. Although high salt detection pathways have been studied in great details but mechanisms that regulate high salt consumption in animals are largely undetermined. We looked into the neural mechanisms of high NaCl consumption in adult Drosophila by which flies modify their acceptance of high salt as a function of diet where a long-term high-salt exposure increases taste sensitivity of pharyngeal LSO neurons and enhance high salt intake. Exposing flies to high NaCl diet for three days show decline in high salt aversion under starvation. Additionally, genetic suppression of LSO pharyngeal neurons in high NaCl fed flies inhibit excessive salt intake. We observed this modulation requires functional LSO neurons and a starvation state or dopamine. Multiple independent taste receptor neurons and pathways are involved in such a modulation. Silencing any one of multiple LSO neuronal types inhibits excessive salt intake. Our study suggests flies can adapt to the amount of salt ingested over several days, indicating the presence of a critical mechanism to reset the salt appetite and related neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Schwann cells play a critical role after peripheral nerve injury by clearing myelin debris, forming axon-guiding Bands of Bungner, and re-myelinating regenerating axons. Schwann cells undergo epigenomic remodeling to differentiate into a repair state that expresses unique genes, some of which are not expressed at other stages of Schwann cell development. We previously identified a set of enhancers that are activated in Schwann cells after nerve injury, and we determined if these enhancers are pre-programmed into the Schwann cell epigenome as poised enhancers prior to injury. Poised enhancers share many attributes of active enhancers, such as open chromatin, but are marked by repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) rather than H3K27ac. We find that most injury-induced enhancers are not marked as poised enhancers prior to injury indicating that injury-induced enhancers are not pre-programmed in the Schwann cell epigenome. Injury-induced enhancers are enriched with AP-1 binding motifs, and the c-JUN subunit of AP-1 had been shown to be critical to drive the transcriptional response of Schwann cells after injury. Using in vivo ChIP-seq analysis we find that c-JUN binds to a subset of injury-induced enhancers. To test the role of specific injury-induced enhancers, we focused on c-JUN-binding enhancers upstream of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) gene, which is only upregulated in repair Schwann cells compared to other stages of Schwann cell development. We confirm that c-JUN regulates these enhancers and also show that the enhancers are required for robust induction of the Shh gene after injury.\n\nSignificance StatementThe pro-regenerative actions of Schwann cells after nerve injury depends on upon profound reprogramming of the epigenome. The repair state is directed by injury-induced transcription factors, like JUN, which is uniquely required after nerve injury. In this study, we test whether the injury program is pre-programmed into the epigenome as poised enhancers and define which enhancers bind JUN. Finally, we test the roles of these enhancers by performing CRISPR-mediated deletion of JUN-bound injury enhancers in the Sonic hedgehog gene. While many long range enhancers drive expression of Sonic hedgehog at different developmental stages of specific tissues, these studies identify an entirely new set of enhancers that are required for Sonic hedgehog induction in Schwann cells after injury.",

To identify genes contributing to age-associated brain functional decline, we formulated an approach to analyze the metabolic network by integrating flux, network structure and transcriptomic databases of neurotransmission and aging. Our findings support that during brain aging: 1) The astrocyte undergoes a metabolic switch from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, decreasing lactate supply to the neuron, while the neuron suffers intrinsic energetic deficit by downregulation of Krebs cycle genes, including mdh1 and mdh2 (Malate-Aspartate Shuttle); 2) Branched-chain amino acid degradation genes were downregulated, identifying dld as a central regulator; 3) Ketone body synthesis increases in the neuron, while the astrocyte increases their utilization, in line with neuronal energy deficit in favor of astrocytes. We identified candidates for preclinical studies targeting energy metabolism to prevent age-associated cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric segregation of cellular components regulates the fate and behavior of somatic stem cells. Similar to dividing budding yeast and precursor cells in C. elegans, it has been shown that mouse neural progenitors establish a diffusion barrier in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which has been associated with asymmetric partitioning of damaged proteins and cellular age. However, the existence of an ER-diffusion barrier in human cells remains unknown. Here we used fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) imaging to show that human embryonic stem cell (hESC)- and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells establish an ER-diffusion barrier during cell division. The human ER-diffusion barrier is regulated via Lamin-dependent mechanisms and is associated with asymmetric segregation of mono- and polyubiquitinated, damaged proteins. Further, forebrain regionalized organoids derived from hESCs were used to show the establishment of an ER-membrane diffusion barrier in more naturalistic tissues mimicking early steps of human brain development. Thus, the data provided here show that human neural progenitors establish a diffusion barrier during cell division in the membrane of the ER, which may allow for asymmetric segregation of cellular components, contributing to the fate and behavior of human neural progenitor cells.\n\nSummaryHuman neural progenitors (NPCs) establish a diffusion barrier during cell division in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing for asymmetric segregation of cellular components, which may contribute to the fate and behavior of human NPCs.",

The richness and complexity of multimodal neuroimaging, however, demands processing methods to integrate information across modalities and different spatial scales. Here, we present micapipe, an open processing pipeline for BIDS-conform multimodal MRI datasets. micapipe can generate i) structural connectomes derived from diffusion tractography, ii) functional connectomes derived from resting-state signal correlations, iii) geodesic distance matrices that quantify cortico-cortical proximity, and iv) microstructural profile covariance matrices that assess inter-regional similarity in cortical myelin proxies. These matrices are routinely generated across established 18 cortical parcellations (100-1000 parcels), in addition to subcortical and cerebellar parcellations. Results are represented on three different surface spaces (native, conte69, fsaverage5), and outputs are BIDS-conform. Processed outputs can be quality controlled at the individual and group level. micapipe was tested on several datasets and is available at https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe, documented at https://micapipe.readthedocs.io/, and containerized as a BIDS App http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/.

Using mouse models and human tumors we demonstrate that protein translation in T cells is repressed by the solid tumor microenvironment (TME) due to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) via phosphorylation of the  subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (p-eIF2). Given that acute glucose deprivation in T cells exacerbated p-eIF2, we show that metabolic reprogramming toward glycolytic independence allays the UPR and p-eIF2, enabling sustained protein translation in T cells in TME stress. UPR mitigation was associated with enhanced degradation of proteins in antitumor T cells, as proteasome inhibition resulted in eIF2 phosphorylation, attenuation of translation, and loss of antitumor efficacy. In contrast, proteasome stimulation relieved translation inhibition, inducing robust T cell tumor control, offering a new therapeutic avenue to fuel the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, thymus expression of various body proteins to eliminate autoreactive T cells during the negative selection process is orchestrated by AIRE and FEZF2. T cells first appeared in vertebrates. However, the evolutionary history of these two genes in relation to T cells emergence is still not clear. Specifically, it is still not known, whether these two genes emerged concurrently to support the negative selection process. Furthermore, whether there is an evolutionary trade-off between these two genes is not known. Whether these two genes play a similar role in controlling auto-reactivity elimination in lampreys and invertebrates is also unknown. We used a plethora of phylogenetic analysis tools including; multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree building, ancestral sequence reconstruction, functional specificity investigation, and positive selection analysis to address these questions. We found that these two genes represent two distinct pathways of negative selection with two unique origins. While AIRE emerged during the divergence of T cells in vertebrates, FEZF2 is far ancient with homologs in invertebrates including Cnidaria, Trichoplax. We found that FEZF2 structure is highly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. Moreover, the genes controlled by both families included a mixture of ancient and recently diverged genes. However, we found that AIRE contains an LXXLL motif for binding nuclear receptors. Conversely, FEZF2 possesses several motifs known to play a role in autophagy, such as DKFPHP, SYSELWKSSL, and SYSEL. However, both genes contain similar motifs such as MAPK regulating motifs. Interestingly, AIRE seems to be lacking in lampreys, in contrast to FEZF2. Taken together, our investigation hints that FEZF2 was initially employed to control a rudimentary auto-reactivity elimination process in invertebrates, then evolved to play a part in controlling a negative selection process in early vertebrates and higher vertebrates. The emergence of AIRE seems to be correlated with controlling the negative selection process in higher vertebrates. The results demonstrate a strong evolutionary trading-off process, where FEZF2 kept controlling certain biological processes whereas AIRE gained control of others. Several critical genes are controlled by both genes, to ensure an adequate negative selection process.",

In a simulation designed to test recovery of pairwise causal relations between transcription factors (TFs), DeepMR gives accurate and unbiased estimates of the  true global causal effect, but its coverage decays in the presence of sequence-dependent confounding. We then apply DeepMR to examine the global relationships learned by a state-of-the-art DL model, BPNet [Avsec et al., 2020], between TFs involved in reprogramming. DeepMRs causal effect estimates validate previously hypothesized relationships between TFs and suggest new relationships for future investigation.",

In this paper, we develop a method to immobilize monoethanolamine, an amine CO2 scrubber, within calcium alginate gel. By mixing monoethanolamine into an alginate solution as the gel was formed, we suspended the compound in the gel, facilitating a means to capture carbon dioxide directly from aquatic environments into the gel, while tethering monoethanolamine and the products formed from CO2 capture to the gel. To delay the eventual diffusion of monoethanolamine out of the gel, we investigated (1) the effect of increasing alginate concentration and (2) the effect of additional alginate layers on the outward diffusion of dye placed in the center of the bead. Using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to quantify diffusion rates over time, we determined that increased alginate concentration paired with increased layering significantly decreased the rate of outward diffusion. Finally, we prepared beads using North Atlantic seawater as a solvent and compared the rate of dye leakage in seawater and distilled water to that in beads prepared in distilled water. Expectedly, we concluded that beads prepared with solvents isotonic to their environments would exhibit less leakage as well as greater mechanical stability, resisting swelling, bursting, or splitting behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Routine cardiovascular interventions such as balloon angioplasty, result in vascular activation and remodeling, often requiring re-intervention. 2D in vitro culture models and small animal experiments have enabled the discovery of important molecular and cellular pathways involved in this process, however the clinical translation of these results is often underwhelming. There is a critical need for an ex vivo model representative of the human vascular physiology and encompassing the complexity of the vascular wall and the physical forces regulating its function. Vascular bioreactors for ex vivo culture of large vessels are viable alternatives, but their custom-made design and insufficient characterization often hinders the reproducibility of the experiments.\n\nThe objective of the study was to design and validate a novel 3D printed cost-efficient and versatile perfusion system, capable of sustaining the viability and functionality of large porcine arteries for 7 days and enabling monitoring of post-injury remodeling.\n\nMultiJet Fusion 3D printing technology was used to engineer the  EasyFlow insert, converting a conventional 50 ml centrifuge tube into a mini bioreactor. Porcine carotid arteries either left untreated or injured with a conventional angioplasty balloon, were cultured under pulsatile flow for up to 7 days. Pressure, heart rate, medium viscosity and shear conditions were adjusted to represent the typical arterial physiology. Tissue viability, cell activation and matrix remodeling were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and vascular function was monitored by duplex ultrasound.\n\nPhysiological blood flow conditions in the EasyFlow bioreactor preserved endothelial coverage and smooth muscle organization and extracellular matrix structure in the vessel wall, as compared to static culture. Injured arteries presented hallmarks of early remodeling, such as intimal denudation, smooth muscle cell disarray and media/adventitia activation in flow culture. Duplex ultrasound confirmed physiological hemodynamic conditions, dose-dependent vasodilator response to nitroglycerin in untreated vessels and impaired dilator response in angioplastied vessels. We here validate a low-cost, robust and reproducible system to study vascular physiopathology, laying the basis for future investigations into the pathological remodeling of blood vessels and creating a platform to test novel therapies and devices ex vivo, in a patient relevant system.",

Here, we present an approach entitled tGPT towards integration of 22.3 million single-cell transcriptomes by modeling gene expression rankings as generative pretraining task. tGPT is conceptually simple in that it autoregressively models the ranking of a gene in the context of its preceding neighbors. We demonstrated the high performance of tGPT on a range of fundamental single-cell analysis tasks and novel applications on bulk tissues. The single-cell clusters and cell lineage trajectories derived from tGPT are highly aligned with known cell labels and states.

Because of its highly repetitive sequence composition, the IGH locus has been particularly difficult to assemble or genotype through the use of standard short read sequencing technologies. Here we introduce ImmunoTyper-SR, an algorithmic method for genotype and CNV analysis of the germline IGHV genes using Illumina whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. ImmunoTyper-SR is based on a novel combinatorial optimization formulation that aims to minimize the total edit distance between reads and their assigned IGHV alleles from a given database, with constraints on the number and distribution of reads across each called allele. We have validated ImmunoTyper-SR on 12 individuals with Illumina WGS data from the 1000 Genomes Project, whose IGHV allele composition have been studied extensively through the use of long read and targeted sequencing platforms, as well as nine individuals from the NIAID COVID Consortium who have been subjected to WGS twice. We have then applied ImmunoTyper-SR on 585 samples from the NIAID COVID Consortium to investigate associations between distinct IGHV alleles and anti-type I IFN autoantibodies which have been linked to COVID-19 severity.",

    "abstract": "The positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT) has led to tremendous strides in haplotype matching on biobank-scale data. For genetic genealogical search, PBWT-based methods have optimized the asymptotic runtime of finding long matches between a query haplotype and a predefined panel of haplotypes. However, to enable fast query searches, the full-sized panel and PBWT data structures must be kept in memory, preventing existing algorithms from scaling up to modern biobank panels consisting of millions of haplotypes. In this work, we propose a space-efficient variation of PBWT named Syllable-PBWT, which divides every haplotype into syllables, builds the PBWT positional prefix arrays on the compressed syllabic panel, and leverages the polynomial rolling hash function for positional substring comparison. With the Syllable-PBWT data structures, we then present a long match query algorithm named Syllable-Query. Compared to Algorithm 3 of Sanaullah et al. (2021), the most time- and space-efficient previously published solution to the long match query problem, Syllable-Query reduced the memory use by a factor of over 100 on both the UK Biobank genotype data and the 1000 Genomes Project sequence data. Surprisingly, the smaller size of our syllabic data structures allows for more efficient iteration and CPU cache usage, granting Syllable-Query even faster runtime than existing solutions.

    "abstract": "Accurate time-to-event (TTE) prediction of clinical outcomes from personal biomedical data is essential for precision medicine. It has become increasingly common that clinical datasets contain information for multiple related patient outcomes from comorbid diseases or multifaceted endpoints of a single disease. Various TTE models have been developed to handle competing risks that are related to mutually exclusive events. However, clinical outcomes are often non-competing and can occur at the same time or sequentially. Here we develop TTE prediction models with the capacity of incorporating data of compatible related clinical outcomes. We test our method on real and synthetic data and find that the incorporation of related auxiliary clinical outcomes can: 1) significantly improve the TTE prediction performance of convention Cox model while maintaining its interpretability; 2) further improve the performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning based models. While the auxiliary outcomes are utilized for model training, the model deployment is not limited by the availability of the auxiliary outcome data because the auxiliary outcome information is not required for the prediction of the primary outcome once the model is trained.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) can provide valuable insights into biological and disease-underlying mechanisms. For studying clinical effects, availability of (confounding) phenotypic traits is essential. The (re)use of RNA-seq or other omics data can be limited by missing, incomplete, or inaccurate phenotypic information. A possible solution are molecular predictors inferring clinical or behavioral phenotypic traits. Such predictors have been developed based on different omics data types and are being applied in various studies.\n\nIn this study, we applied 17 metabolic predictors to infer various traits, including diabetes status or exposure to lipid medication. We evaluated whether these metabolic surrogates can be used as an alternative to reported information for studying the respective phenotypes using TWAS. Our results revealed that in most cases, the use of metabolic surrogates yields similar results compared to using reported information, making them suitable substitutes for such studies.\n\nThe application of metabolomics-derived surrogate outcomes opens new possibilities for reuse of multi-omics data sets, especially in situations where availability of clinical metadata is limited. Missing or incomplete information can be complemented by these surrogates, thereby increasing the size of available data sets. Studies would likely also benefit from the use of such surrogates to correct for potential biological confounding. This should be further investigated.\n\nAuthor summaryTranscriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) can be used to associate gene expression levels with phenotypic traits. These associations can provide insights into biological mechanisms including those that underlie diseases. Such studies require molecular profiling data from a large number of individuals as well as information on the phenotypic trait of interest. Biobanks that collect samples and corresponding molecular data, also collect information on phenotypic traits or clinical information. However, this information can be heterogeneous and/or incomplete, or a certain piece of information could be missing entirely. In this study, we apply metabolic predictors to infer various traits, including diabetes status or exposure to lipid medication. We evaluate whether these metabolic surrogates can be used as an alternative to reported information for studying the respective phenotypes using TWAS. Our results reveal that in many cases, the use of metabolic surrogates yields similar results compared to using reported information, making them suitable substitutes for such studies. The possibility of using these surrogate outcomes can thus increase the size of data sets for studies where phenotypic information is incomplete or missing.",

    "abstract": "Mutational signatures are characteristic patterns of mutations caused by endogenous or exogenous mutational processes. These signatures can be discovered by analyzing mutations in large sets of samples - usually somatic mutations in tumor samples. Most programs for discovering mutational signatures are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Alternatively, signatures can be discovered using hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture models, an approach that has been explored less. These models assign mutations to clusters and view each cluster as being generated from the signature of a particular mutational process. Here we describe mSigHdp, an improved approach to using HDP mixture models to discover mutational signatures. We benchmarked mSigHdp and state-of-the-art NMF-based approaches on 4 realistic synthetic data sets. These data sets encompassed 18 cancer types. In total they contained 3.5x107 single-base-substitution mutations representing 32 signatures and 6.1x106 small-insertion-and-deletion mutations representing 13 signatures. For 3 of the 4 data sets, mSigHdp had the best positive predictive value for discovering mutational signatures, and for all 4 data sets, it had the best true positive rate. Its CPU usage was similar to that of the NMF-based approaches. Thus, mSigHdp is an important and practical addition to the set of tools available for discovering mutational signatures.\n\nData and code availabilitymSigHdp is available at public repositories https://github.com/steverozen/mSigHdp and https://github.com/steverozen/hdpx.

This feature facilitates the enrichment of low-abundant sequences by depleting overrepresented ones in-silico. Existing tools for adaptive sampling either apply signal alignment, which cannot handle human-sized reference sequences, or apply read mapping in sequence space relying on fast GPU base callers for real-time read rejection. Using nanopore long-read mapping tools is also not optimal when mapping shorter reads as usually analyzed in adaptive sampling applications. Here we present a new approach for nanopore adaptive sampling that combines fast CPU and GPU base calling with read classification based on Interleaved Bloom Filters (IBF). Read-Bouncer improves the potential enrichment of low abundance sequences by its high read classification sensitivity and specificity, outperforming existing tools in the field. It robustly removes even reads belonging to large reference sequences while running on commodity hardware without graphical processing units (GPUs), making adaptive sampling accessible for in-field researchers.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death, and their early detection and treatment is important for lowering their prevalence and mortality rate. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) record electrical activity of the heart to provide information used to diagnose and treat various cardiovascular diseases. Many approaches to computer-aided ECG analysis have been performed, including Fourier analysis, principal component analysis, analyzing morphological changes, and machine learning. Due to the high accuracy required of ECG-analysis software, there is no universally-agreed upon algorithm to identify P,Q,R,S, and T-waves and measure intervals of interest. Topological data analysis uses tools from algebraic topology to quantify hole-like shapes within data, and methods using persistence statistics and fractal dimension with machine learning have been applied to ECG signals in the context of detecting arrhythmias within recent years. To our knowledge, there does not exist a method of identifying P,Q,S, and T-waves and measuring intervals of interest which relies on topological features of the data, and we propose a novel topological method for performing these aspects of ECG analysis. Specifically, we establish criteria to identify cardinality-minimal and area-minimal 1-cycles with certain properties as P,Q,S, and T-waves. This yields a procedure for measuring the PR-interval, QT-interval, ST-segment, QRS-duration, P-wave duration, and T-wave duration in Lead II ECG data. We apply our procedure to 400 sets of simulated Lead II ECG signals and compare with the interval values set by the model. Additionally, the algorithm is used to identify cardinality-minimal and area-minimal 1-cycles as P,Q,S, and T-waves in two sets of 200 randomly sampled Lead II ECG signals of real patients with 11 common rhythms. Analysis of optimal 1-cycles identified as P,Q,S, and T-waves and comparison of interval measurements shows that 1-cycle reconstructions can provide useful information about the ECG signal and could hold utility in characterizing arrhythmias.\n\nAuthor summaryTopological data analysis (TDA) has been a rapidly growing field within the past 15 years and has found applications across many fields. In the context of TDA, several algorithms primarily using persistence barcode statistics and machine learning have been applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in recent years. We use a topological data-analytic method to identify subsets of an ECG signal which are representative of certain topological features in the ECG signal, and we propose that those subsets coincide with the P,Q,S, and T-waves in the ECG signal. We then use information about these subsets of the signal identified as P,Q,S, and T-waves to measure the PR-interval, QT-interval, ST-segment, QRS-duration, P-wave duration, and T-wave duration. We demonstrate our method on both simulated and real Lead II ECG data. These results show how identifying subsets of an ECG signal with certain topological properties could be used in analyzing the morphology of the signal over time and in arrhythmia-detection algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Wheat stripe rust and powdery mildew are important worldwide diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The wheat cultivar Xingmin318 (XM318) is resistant to both wheat stripe rust and powdery mildew, which are caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), respectively. To explore the molecular mechanisms of wheat defenses against Pst and Bgt, quantitative proteomic analyses of XM318 inoculated with Pst and Bgt, respectively, were performed using tandem mass tags (TMT) technology. A total of 741 proteins were identified as differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs). Bioinformatics analyses indicated that some functional categories, including antioxidant activity, exhibited obvious differences between Pst and Bgt infections. Intriguingly, only 42 DAPs responded to both Pst and Bgt infections. Twelve DAPs were randomly selected for RT-qPCR analysis, and the mRNA expression levels of eleven were consistent with their protein expression. Furthermore, gene silencing using the virus-induced gene silencing system indicated that glutathione S-transferase (TaGSTU6) has an important role in resistance to Bgt but not to Pst. TaGSTU6 was shown to interact with the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domain-containing protein (TaCBSX3). Knockdown of TaCBSX3 expression only reduced wheat resistance to Bgt infection. Overexpression of TaGSTU6 and TaCBSX3 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) promoted plant resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). Our results indicated that the TaGSTU6 interacting with TaCBSX3 only confers wheat resistance to Bgt, suggesting that wheat has different response mechanisms to Pst and Bgt stress.\n\nOne-sentence summaryProteomics revealed a difference in the wheat resistance response to Pst and Bgt, and the TaGSTU6/TaCBSX3 interaction plays an important role only in wheat resistance to Bgt.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) visualizes brain structures at increasingly higher resolution and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as field strength increases. Yet, mapping the BOLD response to distinct neuronal processes continues to be challenging. Here, we performed 3T and 7T-fMRI analysis of motor-task activation and resting-state connectivity with adjusted SNR. We then applied graph theory to analyze resting-state neuronal networks detected by fMRI after a simple motor task. Despite adjusted SNR, 7T achieved a higher functional specificity of the BOLD response than 3T-fMRI. Following the motor task, 7T-fMRI therefore enabled the detection of an  offline replay that was directly linked to brain regions associated with memory consolidation. These findings reveal how memory processing is initiated even after simple motor tasks and begins earlier than previously shown. Thus, the superior capability of 7T-fMRI to detect subtle functional dynamics promises to improve diagnostics and therapeutic assessment of neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "In evaluating the personality attributes and performance of the self, people are inclined to view themselves superior to others, a phenomenon known as superiority illusion (SI). This illusive outlook pervades peoples thoughts, creating hope for the future and promoting mental health. Although a specific cortico-striatal functional connectivity (FC) under dopaminergic modulation was previously shown to be implicated in SI, the underlying whole-brain mechanisms have remained unclarified. Herein, to reveal the neural network subserving individuals SI, we conducted a data-driven, machine-learning investigation to explore the resting-state FC network across the whole brain. Using the locally-acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 123), we identified a set of 15 FCs most informative in classifying individuals with higher-versus lower-than-average levels of SI in evaluating positive trait words (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.81). Among the 15 FCs, the contribution level to the classification was 11% by the previously-highlighted cortico-striatal FC alone, but 60% by the encompassing cortico-limbico-striatal network cluster. A newly-identified, cortico-thalamic FC and another FC cluster also demonstrated substantial contribution. The classification accuracy was generalized into an independent cohort (n = 36; AUC = 0.73). Importantly, using the same set of 15 FCs, we achieved prediction on an individuals level of striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability (Pearson correlation, r = 0.46, P = 0.005). This is the first successful identification of the whole-brain neural network that simultaneously predicts the behavioral manifestation and molecular underpinning of an essential psychological process that promotes well-being and mental health.\n\nSignificance StatementSuperiority illusion (SI) is a basic self-referential framework that pervades peoples thoughts and promotes well-being and mental health. An aberrant form of SI has been reported in psychiatric conditions such as depression. Our hypothesis-free, data-driven investigation revealed the spatially-distributed neural network that for the first time achieved prediction on an individuals levels of SI and the striatal dopaminergic transmission simultaneously. In principle, this multiple-biological-layer framework can be applicable to any behavioral trait to establish a link with its underlying neural network and neurochemical properties, which could quantitatively present the relation of its aberrant form with the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Future clinical research may aid in deriving a diagnostic biomarker for examining the related behavioral and neurochemical characteristics within individuals.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent success in vaccinating populations against SARS-CoV-2, concerns about immunity duration, continued efficacy against emerging variants, protection from infection and transmission, and worldwide vaccine availability, remain. Although mRNA, pDNA, and viral-vector based vaccines are being administered, no protein subunit-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is approved. Molecular adjuvants targeting pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) could improve and broaden the efficacy and durability of vaccine responses. Native SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulate various PRRs, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic-acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RIG-I). We hypothesized that targeting the same PRRs using adjuvants on nanoparticles along with a stabilized spike (S) protein antigen could provide broad and efficient immune responses. Formulations targeting TLR4 (MPLA), TLR7/8 (R848), TLR9 (CpG), and RIG-I (PUUC) delivered on degradable polymer-nanoparticles (NPs) were combined with the S1 subunit of S protein and assessed in vitro with isogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions (iso-MLRs). For in vivo studies, the adjuvanted nanoparticles were combined with stabilized S protein and assessed using intranasal and intramuscular prime-boost vaccination models in mice. Combination NP-adjuvants targeting both TLR and RIG-I (MPLA+PUUC, CpG+PUUC, or R848+PUUC) differentially increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-1{beta}, IL-12p70, IL-27, IFN-{beta}) by APCs cultured in vitro, and induced differential T cell proliferation. When delivered intranasally, MPLA+PUUC NPs enhanced local CD4+CD44+ activated memory T cell responses while MPLA NPs increased anti-S-protein-specific IgG and IgA in the lung. Following intramuscular delivery, PUUC-carrying NPs induced strong humoral immune responses, characterized by increases in anti-S-protein IgG and neutralizing antibody titers and germinal center B cell populations (GL7+ and BCL6+ B cells). MPLA+PUUC NPs further boosted S-protein-neutralizing antibody titers and T follicular helper cell populations in draining lymph nodes. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2-mimicking adjuvants and subunit vaccines could lead to robust and unique route-specific adaptive immune responses and may provide additional tools against the pandemic.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=58 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478507v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b8174org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@701721org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@feb860org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fae094_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, whole genome sequencing data of the viral genomes that infect non-human animal species has been scant. Here, we detected and sequenced a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (AY.3) in fecal samples from an 11-year-old domestic house cat previously exposed to an owner who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular testing of two fecal samples collected 7 days apart yielded relatively high levels of viral RNA. Sequencing of the feline-derived viral genomes showed the two to be identical, and differing by between 4 and 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pairwise comparisons to human-derived lineage AY.3 sequences collected in the same geographic area and time period. However, several mutations unique to the feline samples reveal their divergence from this cohort on phylogenetic analysis. These results demonstrate continued spillover infections of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that threaten human and animal health, as well as highlight the importance of collecting fecal samples when testing for SARS-CoV-2 in animals. To the authors knowledge, this is the first published case of a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a domestic cat in the United States.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is expected that functional, mainly missense and loss-of-function (LOF), and regulatory variants are responsible for phenotypic differences among breeds, genetic lines, and varieties of livestock and crop species that have undergone diverse selection histories. However, there is still limited knowledge about the existing missense and LOF variation in livestock commercial populations, in particular regarding population-specific variation and how it can affect applications such as across-breed genomic prediction.\n\nMethodsWe re-sequenced the whole genome of 7,848 individuals from nine commercial pig breeding lines (average sequencing coverage: 4.1x) and imputed whole-genome genotypes for 440,610 pedigree-related individuals. The called variants were categorized according to predicted functional annotation (from LOF to intergenic) and prevalence level (number of lines in which the variant segregated; from private to widespread). Variants in each category were examined in terms of distribution along the genome, minor allele frequency, Wrights fixation index (FST), individual load, and association to production traits.\n\nResultsOf the 46 million called variants, 28% were private (called in only one line) and 21% were widespread (called in all nine lines). Genomic regions with low recombination rate were enriched with private variants. Low-prevalence variants (called in one or a few lines only) were enriched for lower allele frequencies, lower FST, and putatively functional and regulatory roles (including loss-of-function and deleterious missense variants). Only a small subset of low-prevalence variants was found at intermediate allele frequencies and had large estimated effects on production traits. Individuals on average carried less private deleterious missense alleles than expected compared to other predicted consequence types. A small subset of low-prevalence variants with intermediate allele frequencies and higher FST were detected as significantly associated to the production traits and explained small fractions of phenotypic variance (up to 3.2%). These associations were tagged by other more widespread variants, including intergenic variants.\n\nConclusionsMost low-prevalence variants are kept at very low allele frequency and only a small subset contributed detectable fractions of phenotypic variance. Not accounting for low-prevalence variants is therefore unlikely to hinder across-breed analyses, in particular for genomic prediction of breeding values using reference populations of a different genetic background.",

We document genetic diversity within exogenous and integrated HHV species and within integration sites of HHV-6.

    "abstract": "The Stiff Stalk heterotic pool is a foundation of US maize seed parent germplasm and has been heavily utilized by both public and private maize breeders since its inception in the 1930s. Flowering time and plant height are critical characteristics for both inbred parents and their test crossed hybrid progeny. To study these traits, a six parent multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population was developed including maize inbred lines B73, B84, PHB47 (B37 type), LH145 (B14 type), PHJ40 (novel early Stiff Stalk), and NKH8431 (B73/B14 type). A set of 779 doubled haploid lines were evaluated for flowering time and plant height in two field replicates in 2016 and 2017, and a subset of 689 and 561 doubled haploid lines were crossed to two testers, respectively, and evaluated as hybrids in two locations in 2018 and 2019 using an incomplete block design. Markers were derived from a Practical Haplotype Graph built from the founder whole genome assemblies and genotype-by-sequencing and exome capture-based sequencing of the population. Genetic mapping utilizing an update to R/qtl2 revealed differing profiles of significant loci for both traits between 636 of the DH lines and two sets of 571 and 472 derived hybrids. Genomic prediction was used to test the feasibility of predicting hybrid phenotypes based on the per se data. Predictive abilities were highest on direct models trained using the data they would predict (0.55 to 0.63), and indirect models trained using per se data to predict hybrid traits had slightly lower predictive abilities (0.49 to 0.55). Overall, this finding is consistent with the overlapping and non-overlapping significant QTL found within the per se and hybrid populations and suggests that selections for phenology traits can be made effectively on doubled haploid lines before hybrid data is available.\n\nCore IdeasA multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) mapping population was developed from six founder Stiff Stalk maize inbreds with commercial relevance. Genetic mapping utilizing an update to R/qtl2 was demonstrated for flowering and plant height traits.\n\nGenetic mapping using maize inbred and hybrid information was compared and provided insight into trait expression in inbreds relative to heterotic testcross hybrids.",

However, connectomic analyses of lobula, a putative center of object-like feature detection, remains underdeveloped, largely because of incomplete data on the inputs to the brain region. Here, we attempted to map the columnar inputs into the Drosophila lobula neuropil by performing connectivity- and morphology-based clustering on a densely reconstructed connectome dataset. While the dataset mostly lacked visual neuropils other than lobula, which would normally help identify inputs to lobula, our clustering analysis successfully extracted clusters of cells with homogeneous connectivity and morphology, likely representing genuine cell types. We were able to draw a correspondence between the resulting clusters and previously identified cell types, revealing previously undocumented connectivity between lobula input and output neurons. While future, more complete connectomic reconstructions are necessary to verify the results presented here, they can serve as a useful basis for formulating hypotheses on mechanisms of visual feature detection in lobula.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus-induced disease 19 (COVID-19) infects more than three hundred and sixty million patients worldwide, and people with severe symptoms frequently die of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Autopsy demonstrates the presence of thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries. Recent studies indicated that excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributed to immunothrombosis, thereby leading to extensive intravascular coagulopathy and multiple organ dysfunction. Thus, understanding the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced NET formation would be helpful to reduce thrombosis and prevent ARDS. It has been shown that sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release in vitro, and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R406 inhibited NETosis caused by COVID-19 plasma. However, the serum components responsible for NET formation are still unknown. In this study, we found that virus-free extracellular vesicles (EVs) from COVID-19 patients (COVID-19 EVs) induced robust NET formation via Syk-coupled C-type lectin member 5A (CLEC5A). Blockade of CLEC5A inhibited COVID-19 EVs-induced NETosis, and simultaneous blockade of CLEC5A and TLR2 further suppressed SARS-CoV-2-induced NETosis in vitro. Moreover, thromboinflammation and lung fibrosis were attenuated dramatically in clec5a-/-/tlr2-/- mice. These results suggest that COVID-19 EVs play critical roles in SARS-CoV-2-induced immunothrombosis, and blockade of CLEC5A and TLR2 is a promising strategy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced intravascular coagulopathy and reduce the risk of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Although human genetics partially explain the heritability of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), the human gut microbiome also plays a significant role. While changes in human genetics at the population level occur only after many generations, the gut microbiome evolves over a shorter time span. The gut microbiome is also vertically transmitted across generations, therefore, changes in one generation can be passed on to subsequent generations. However, it is unknown whether the gut microbiome influences natural selection of its host under obesogenic pressure. Here, we show that C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (60% fat, HFD) over four generations develop resistance to obesity and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Unexpectedly, the mice were increasingly leaner as well as more glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive across generations. This phenomenon was attributed to the most obese mice not yielding progenies, whereas the leanest mice successfully reproduced, and their offspring were also resistant to obesity. In other words, a population bottleneck was observed. Because all the mice were nearly genetically identical inbred C57BL/6J mice, the large variation in body weight gain in response to HFD feeding was likely independent of genetics. We explored whether microbial factors enriched in obesity-resistant mice promote healthier host metabolic phenotypes under HFD feeding, thereby contributing to the heterogeneity in body weight gain and providing an adaptive advantage to the host. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that body weight gain was positively correlated with Lactococcus lactis, as well as negatively correlated with Lactobacillus johnsonii and pathways for coenzyme A biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis (lysine, isoleucine, valine), and nucleotide biosynthesis (adenosine, guanosine). Overall, we observed multigenerational adaptation in the gut microbiome correlated with improved metabolism, yet further studies are needed to validate that these adaptations drive metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "The influence of the microbiota on viral transmission and replication is well appreciated. However, its impact on retroviral pathogenesis outside of transmission/replication control remained unknown. Using Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV), we found that some commensal bacteria promoted the development of leukemia induced by this retrovirus. The promotion of leukemia development by commensals was due to suppression of the adaptive immune response through upregulation of several negative regulators of immunity. These negative regulators included Serpinb9b and Rnf128, which are associated with a poor prognosis of some spontaneous human cancers. Upregulation of Serpinb9b was mediated by sensing of bacteria by NOD1/NOD2/RIPK2 pathway. This work describes a novel mechanism by which the microbiota enhances tumorigenesis within gut-distant organs and points at potential new targets for cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome plays important roles in the maintenance of health and pathogenesis of diseases in the growing host. In order to fully comprehend the interplay of the gut microbiome and host, a foundational understanding of longitudinal bacteriome and mycobiome development is necessary. In this study, we evaluated enteric bacterial, fungal and host dynamics throughout the lifetime of commercial swine. We collected a total of 234 fecal samples from 9 pigs across 31 time points in 3 developmental stages (5 preweaning, 15 nursery, and 11 growth adult). We then performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing for bacterial profiles and qPCR for the fungus Kazachstania slooffiae. We identified distinct bacteriome clustering according to the host developmental stage, with the preweaning stage exhibiting low bacterial diversity and high volatility amongst samples. We further recovered clusters of bacterial populations that were considered core, transient and increasing throughout the host lifetime, suggesting distinct yet important roles by which these differing bacterial population clusters played in the different host stages. Kazachstania slooffiae was absent in the preweaning stage but peaked during the nursery stage of the host. We determined that all host growth stages contained negative correlations between K. slooffiae and bacterial genera, with only the growth adult stage containing positive correlates. The lack of positive correlates and shared K. slooffiae-bacteria interactions between stages warrants future research into the interactions amongst these kingdoms for host health. This research is foundational for understanding how the bacteriome and mycobiome develop singularly, as well as within a complex ecosystem in the hosts gut environment.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living organisms. These bacteria are important models for both fundamental and Synthetic Biology, owing to their highly reduced genomes. They are also relevant in the medical and veterinary fields, as they are pathogenic of both humans and most livestock species. Mycoplasma cells have minute sizes, often in the 300-800 nanometers range. As these dimensions are close to the diffraction limit of visible light, fluorescence imaging in mycoplasmas is often poorly informative. Recently developed \"Super-Resolution Imaging\" techniques can break this diffraction limit, improving the imaging resolution by an order of magnitude and offering a new nanoscale vision of the organization of these bacteria. These techniques have however not been applied to mycoplasmas before. Here, we describe an efficient and reliable protocol to perform Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) imaging in mycoplasmas. We provide a polyvalent transposon-based system to express the photo-convertible fluorescent protein mEos3.2, enabling Photo-Activated Localization Microscopy (PALM) in most Mycoplasma species. We also describe the application of direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM). We showcase the potential of these techniques by studying the subcellular localization of two proteins of interest. Our work highlights the benefits of state-of-the-art microscopy techniques for mycoplasmology and provides an incentive to further the development SMLM strategies to study these organisms in the future.\n\nImportanceMycoplasmas are important models in biology, as well as highly problematic pathogens in the medical and veterinary fields. The very small size of these bacteria, well below the micron, limits the usefulness of traditional fluorescence imaging methods as their resolution limit is similar to the dimensions of the cells. Here, to bypass this issue, we established a set of state-of-the-art \"Super-Resolution Microscopy\" techniques in a wide range of Mycoplasma species. We describe two strategies: PALM, based on the expression of a specific photo-convertible fluorescent protein; and dSTORM, based on fluorophore-coupled antibody labeling. With these methods, we successfully performed single-molecule imaging of proteins of interest at the surface of the cells and in the cytoplasm, at lateral resolutions well below 50 nanometers. Our work paves the way toward a better understanding of mycoplasmas biology through imaging of subcellular structures at the nanometer scale.",

We propose naming this order (representing 16 genera) \"Lutiacidiplasmatales\" due to their occurrence in various acidic environments and placement within the phylum Thermoplasmatota. A phylum-level analysis revealed that Thermoplasmatota evolution had been punctuated by several periods of high levels of novel gene family acquisition. Several essential metabolisms, such as aerobic respiration and acid tolerance, were likely acquired independently by divergent lineages through convergent evolution rather than inherited from a common ancestor. Ultimately, this study describes the terrestrially prevalent Lutiacidiciplasmatales and indicates convergent evolution as an important evolutionary driving force in archaeal lineages with complex histories.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a globally significant opportunistic pathogen causing healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections. This study examined the epidemiology and the distribution of resistance and virulence genes in clinical K. pneumoniae strains in Kenya. Eighty-nine K. pneumoniae isolates were collected over six years from five counties in Kenya and were analyzed using whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics. These isolates were obtained from community-acquired (62/89) and healthcare-associated infections (21/89), and the hospital environment (6/89). Genetic analysis revealed the presence of blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-181 carbapenemase genes and the armA and rmtF genes known to confer pan-aminoglycoside resistance. The most abundant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes identified were blaCTX-M-15 (36/89), blaTEM (35/89), and blaOXA (18/89). In addition, one isolate had a mobile colistin resistance gene (mcr-8). Fluoroquinolone resistance-conferring mutations in gyrA and parC genes were also observed. The most notable virulence factors were those associated with hyper-virulence (rmpA/A2 and magA), yersiniabactin (ybt), salmochelin (iro), and aerobactin (iuc and iutA). Thirty-eight distinct sequence types were identified, including known global lineages ST14, ST15, ST147, and ST307, and a regional clone ST17 implicated in regional outbreaks. In addition, this study genetically characterized two potential hypervirulent isolates and two community-acquired ST147 high-risk clones that contained carbapenemase genes, yersiniabactin, and other multidrug resistance genes. These results demonstrate that the resistome and virulome of Kenyan clinical and hospital environmental K. pneumoniae isolates are diverse. The reservoir of high risk-clones capable of spreading resistance and virulence factors have the potential to cause unmanageable infection outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYKlebsiella pneumoniae is one of the human-disease-causing bacteria that easily acquires and spreads antibiotic resistance genes and is thus a serious threat to human health. We studied both the antibiotic resistance genes and the genes it uses to cause disease (virulence). Forty-two percent of our isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). They carried several resistance and virulence genes bound in mobile circular DNA molecules called plasmids which easily migrate and spread the genes between bacteria. We identified 38 distinct K. pneumoniae strains (STs) distributed within the study sites. Fifteen isolates were classified under the groups of K. pneumoniae strains known to cause global infection outbreaks such as ST14, ST15 and ST147 collected from Nairobi and Kisumu, hotspot areas for spread of resistance. In particular, two ST147 isolates were resistant to carbapenems and one isolate to colistin, which are last line antibiotics. We also identified two isolates with the potential to cause high levels of disease. We concluded that the presence of highly resistant and virulent strains in the hospital and community demonstrates a need for the continuous monitoring and management of MDR K. pneumoniae infections to prevent disease outbreaks that are difficult to control and that lead to high death rate.",

In addition, T9I caused less cell death and a weaker cytokine production. The channel property changes might be responsible for the Omicron variant releases less efficiently and induces a comparatively lower level of cell damage in the infected cells.

Type III IFN (IFN-{lambda}) exhibit cell-type specific and long-lasting functions in autoinflammation, tumorigenesis and antiviral defense. Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme USP22 as central regulator of basal IFN-{lambda} secretion and SARS-CoV-2 infections in native human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). USP22-deficient hIECs strongly upregulate genes involved in IFN signaling and viral defense, including numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), with increased secretion of IFN-{lambda} and enhanced STAT1 signaling, even in the absence of exogenous IFNs or viral infection. Interestingly, USP22 controls basal and 23-cGAMP-induced STING activation and loss of STING reversed STAT activation and ISG and IFN-{lambda} expression. Intriguingly, USP22-deficient hIECs are protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral replication and the formation of de novo infectious particles, in a STING-dependent manner. These findings reveal USP22 as central host regulator of STING and type III IFN signaling, with important implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antiviral defense.",

Dynein motility requires Dynactin and a family of activating adaptors that stabilize the Dynein-Dynactin complex and promote regulated interactions with cargo in space and time. How activating adaptors limit Dynein activation to specialized subcellular locales is unclear. Here, we reveal that Spindly, a mitotic Dynein adaptor at the kinetochore corona, exists natively in a closed conformation that occludes binding of Dynein-Dynactin to its CC1 box and Spindly motif. A structure-based analysis identified various mutations promoting an open conformation of Spindly that binds Dynein-Dynactin. A region of Spindly downstream from the Spindly motif and not required for cargo binding faces the CC1 box and stabilizes the intramolecular closed conformation. This region is also required for robust kinetochore localization of Spindly, suggesting that kinetochores promote Spindly activation to recruit Dynein. This mechanism may be paradigmatic for Dynein activation by other adaptors at various cellular locales.",

Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model system, we computationally predicted and then biophysically validated and characterized its long-range RNA-RNA genomic interaction. Using multiple RNA computation assessment programs, we determine the primary RNA-RNA interacting site among JEV isolates and numerous related viruses. Following in vitro transcription of RNA, we provide, for the first time, characterization of an RNA-RNA interaction using multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and analytical ultra-centrifugation (AUC). Next, we report the first RNA-RNA interaction study quantified by microscale thermophoresis (MST), demonstrating that the 5 and 3 TR of JEV interact with nM affinity, which is significantly reduced when the conserved cyclization sequence is not present. Furthermore, we perform computational kinetic analyses validating the cyclization sequence as the primary driver of this RNA-RNA interaction. Finally, we examined the 3-dimensional structure of the interaction using small-angle X-ray scattering, revealing a flexible yet stable interaction. This pathway can be adapted and utilized to study various viral and human long-non-coding RNA-RNA interactions, and determine their binding affinities, a critical pharmacological property of designing potential therapeutics.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Microaerophilic pathogens such as Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis have robust oxygen consumption systems to detoxify oxygen and maintain the intracellular redox balance. This oxygen consumption is a result of the H2O-forming NADH oxidase activity of two distinct flavin-containing systems: H2O-forming NADH oxidases (NOXes) and multicomponent flavodiiron proteins (FDPs). Both systems are not membrane-bound and recycle NADH into oxidized NAD+ while simultaneously removing O2 from the local environment, making them crucial for the survival of human microaerophilic pathogens. In this study, using bioinformatic and biochemical analysis, we show that T. vaginalis lacks a NOX-like enzyme, and instead harbors three proteins that are very close in their amino acid sequence and represent a natural fusion between N-terminal FDP, central rubredoxin and C-terminal NADH:rubredoxin oxidoreductase domains. We demonstrate that this natural fusion protein with fully populated flavin redox centers unlike a \"stand-alone\" FDP (also present in T. vaginalis), directly accepts reducing equivalents of NADH to catalyze the four-electron reduction of O2 to water within a single polypeptide and with an extremely high turnover. Using single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) we present structural insight into the spatial organization of the FDP core within this multidomain fusion protein. Our studies represent an important addition to our understanding of systems that allow human protozoan parasites to maintain their optimal redox balance and survive transient exposure to oxic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction is a nutritional intervention that reproducibly protects against the maladaptive consequences of cardiovascular diseases. Pathological cardiac hypertrophy leads to cellular growth, dysfunction (with mitochondrial dysregulation), and oxidative stress. The mechanisms behind the cardiovascular protective effects of calorie restriction are still under investigation. In this study, we addressed the impact of calorie restriction on mitochondria, oxidative stress markers, and {beta}-adrenergic signaling during cardiac hypertrophy. This dietetic intervention prevented cardiac protein elevation, decreased atrial natriuretic peptide levels, and blocked the increase in heart weight per tibia length index seen in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Our data suggest that inhibition of cardiac pathological growth by calorie restriction is accompanied by a lower mitochondrial reactive oxygen species formation and improved mitochondrial content. We also found that superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities negatively correlate with cardiac hypertrophy. Calorie restriction also attenuated the opening of the Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore in mitochondria isolated from isoproterenol-treated mice. Isoproterenol (a {beta}-agonist) increases cardiac rate (chronotropic response) and force of contraction (inotropic response). Given the nature of cardiac hypertrophy induction by isoproterenol, we tested whether calorie restriction could change the cardiac {beta}-adrenergic sensitivity. Using isolated rat hearts in a langendorff system, we found that calorie restriction mice (similar to controls) have preserved {beta}-adrenergic signaling. On the flipside, hypertrophic hearts (treated for seven days with isoproterenol) were insensitive to {beta}-adrenergic activation using isoproterenol (50 nM). Despite protecting against cardiac hypertrophy, calorie restriction did not alter the lack of responsiveness to isoproterenol of isolated hearts harvested from isoproterenol-treated rats. These results suggest (through a series of mitochondrial, oxidative stress, and cardiac hemodynamic studies) that calorie restriction possesses beneficial effects against hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, it may lack effects on some of the hypertrophic consequences, such as {beta}-adrenergic signaling repression.",

    "abstract": "Global agriculture loses over $100 billion of produce annually to crop pests such as insects. Many of these crop pests either have no current means of control or have developed resistance against chemical pesticides. Long dsRNAs are capable of inducing RNA interference (RNAi) in insects and are emerging as novel highly selective alternatives for sustainable insect management strategies. However, there are significant challenges associated with RNAi efficacy in insects. In this study, we synthesised a range of chemically modified long dsRNA in an approach to improve nuclease resistance and RNAi efficacy in insects. The results showed that dsRNA containing phosphorothioate modifications demonstrated increased resistance to southern green stink bug saliva nucleases. Phosphorothioate and 2-fluoro modified dsRNA also demonstrated increased resistance to degradation by soil nucleases and increased RNAi efficacy in Drosophila melanogaster cell cultures. In live insects, chemically modified long dsRNA successfully resulted in mortality in both stink bug and corn rootworm. The results provide further mechanistic insight of RNAi efficacy dependence on modifications in the sense or antisense strand of the dsRNA in insects and demonstrate for the first time that RNAi can successfully be triggered by chemically modified long dsRNA in insect cells or live insects.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic of COVID-19 has become the global health challenge due to the emergence of new variants. The Receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein that makes direct interaction with ACE-2 has shown unique mutated residues in most of the variants of concern (VOC). Recently WHO declared the Omicron (B.1.1.529) as VOC considering it as a highly mutated variant which includes a total of 60 mutations out of which 15 mutations occurred in RBD region of SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of Protein-protein (Omicron RBD-h-ACE2) interaction was already proved to inhibit the viral infection. In this study, by using molecular dynamic simulations efforts are made to explore the atomistic details of Omicron RBD-h-ACE2 interaction. Based on MD simulations, h-ACE2 motif is found to be interacting with omicron RBD domain. Interaction analysis had provided key residues interacting with Omicron-RBD that helped to extract h-ACE2 peptide. Here, rational design of the peptides that have resemblance with h-ACE2 is done and the peptide library is subjected for inhibition studies against Omicron-RBD. The current study helped to identify the significant peptides that can inhibit Omicron-RBD. Altogether the performed studies will provide an opportunity to develop potential therapeutic peptidomimetics effective against Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 allow the virus to probe the sequence space in search of higher-fitness states. New sublineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants-of-concern (VOCs) continuously emerge with such mutations. Interestingly, the sites of mutation in these sublineages vary between the VOCs. Whether such differences reflect the random nature of mutation appearance or distinct evolutionary spaces of spike in the VOCs is unclear. Here we show that each position of spike has a lineage-specific likelihood for mutations to appear and dominate descendent sublineages. This likelihood can be accurately estimated from the lineage-specific mutational profile of spike at a protein-wide level. The mutability environment of each position, including adjacent sites on the protein structure and neighboring sites on the network of comutability, accurately forecast changes in descendent sublineages. Mapping of imminent changes within the VOCs can contribute to the design of immunogens and therapeutics that address future forms of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Bulky cargos like procollagens, apolipoproteins, and mucins exceed the size of conventional COPII vesicles. During evolution a process emerged in metazoans, predominantly governed by the TANGO1 protein family, that organizes cargo at the exit sites of the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitates export by the formation of tunnel-like connections between the ER and Golgi. Cargorecognition appears to be mediated by an SH3-like domain, however, just how the vastly different cargos are recognized remains elusive. Based on structural and dynamic data as well as interaction studies from NMR spectroscopy presented here, we show that the luminal cargo-recognition domain of TANGO1 adopts a new functional fold for which we suggest the term MOTH (MIA, Otoraplin, TALI/TANGO1 homology) domain. Also, differences in the structural properties within the domain family suggest fundamentally different mechanisms of cargo-recognition in vertebrates and invertebrates. Similarly, in vertebrates, it is proposed that cargo-specificity is mediated by structural differences within the vertebrate TANGO1 and TALI MOTH domains themselves.",

There is some evidence that chronic alcohol consumption influences SARS-CoV2 infection risk, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we generated expression data of SARS-CoV2 infection relevant genes (Ace2, Tmprss2 and Mas) in different organs in rat models of chronic alcohol exposure and alcohol dependence. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 represent the virus entry point whereas Mas is activating the anti-inflammatory response once the cells are infected. Across three different chronic alcohol test conditions, we found a consistent upregulation of Ace2 in the lung, which is the most affected organ in Covid-19 patients. Other organs such as liver, ileum, kidney, heart, and the brain showed also up-regulation of Ace2 and Mas but in a less consistent manner across the different animal models, while Tmprss2 was unaffected in all conditions. We suggest that alcohol-induced up-regulation of Ace2 can lead to an elevated stochastic probability of cellular virus entry and may thus confer a molecular risk factor for a SARS-CoV2 infection.",

    "abstract": "One of the most common symptoms in COVID-19 is a sudden loss of smell. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the olfactory bulb (OB) from animal models and sporadically in COVID-19 patients. To decipher the specific role over the SARS-CoV-2 proteome at olfactory level, we characterized the in-depth molecular imbalance induced by the expression of GFP-tagged SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (M, N, E, S) on mouse OB cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic trajectories uncovered a widespread metabolic remodeling commonly converging in extracellular matrix organization, lipid metabolism and signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases. The molecular singularities and specific interactome expression modules were also characterized for each viral structural factor. The intracellular molecular imbalance induced by each SARS-CoV-2 structural protein was accompanied by differential activation dynamics in survival and immunological routes in parallel with a differentiated secretion profile of chemokines in OB cells. Machine learning through a proteotranscriptomic data integration uncovered TGF-beta signaling as a confluent activation node by the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteome. Taken together, these data provide important avenues for understanding the multifunctional immunomodulatory properties of SARS-CoV-2 M, N, S and E proteins beyond their intrinsic role in virion formation, deciphering mechanistic clues to the olfactory inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "While fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) testing is used to monitor surface waters for potential health hazards, recent studies report substantial variation in FIB levels and that observed variation appeared dependent on scale of analysis (SOA). Citizen science data and random effects models were used to quantify variance in FIB levels attributable to spatial versus temporal factors. Separately, Bayesian models were used to quantify the ratio of spatial to nonspatial variance in FIB levels, and identify associations between environmental factors and FIB levels. Separate analyses were performed for each stream, lake, and watershed as well as at the state-level (three SOAs). As SOA increased (from waterway to watershed to statewide models), variance attributable to spatial sources generally increased and variance attributable to temporal sources generally decreased. While relationships between FIB levels and environmental factors, such as flow conditions, were constant across SOA, the effect of land cover was both highly dependent on SOA and consistently smaller than the effect of outfalls. This study demonstrates the importance of scale when designing monitoring programs or using FIB monitoring to inform management. Moreover, these data represent a comprehensive survey of water quality in Upstate NY, and the study highlights a valuable publicly available database.",

    "abstract": "II.Bacteria use various strategies to become antibiotic resistant. The molecular details of these strategies are not fully understood. We can increase our understanding by investigating the same strategies found in antibiotic-producing bacteria. In this work, we characterize the self-resistance protein Ecm16 encoded by echinomycin-producing bacteria. Ecm16 is a structural homolog of the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) protein UvrA. Expression of ecm16 in the heterologous system Escherichia coli was sufficient to render resistance against echinomycin. Ecm16 preferentially binds double-stranded DNA over single-stranded DNA and is likely to primarily interact with the backbone of DNA using a nucleotide-independent binding mode. Ecm16s binding affinity for DNA increased significantly when the DNA is intercalated with echinomycin. Ecm16 can repair echinomycin-induced DNA damage independently of NER. Like UvrA, Ecm16 has ATPase activity and this activity is essential for Ecm16s ability to render echinomycin resistance. Notably, UvrA and Ecm16 were unable to complement each others function. Increasing the cellular levels of UvrA in E. coli was insufficient to render echinomycin resistance. Similarly, Ecm16 was unable to repair DNA damage that is specific to UvrA. Together, our findings identify new mechanistic details of how a refurbished DNA repair protein Ecm16 can specifically render resistance to the DNA intercalator echinomycin. Our results, together with past observations, suggest a model where Ecm16 recognizes double helix distortions caused by echinomycin and repairs the problem independently of NER.",

During blooms, Phaeocystis species produce large carbon-rich colonies, thus creating a unique interface for bacterial interactions. While bacteria are known to interact with phytoplankton--e.g., they promote growth by producing phytohormones and vitamins--such interactions have not been shown for Phaeocystis. Therefore, we investigated the composition and function of P. globosa microbiomes. Specifically, we tested whether microbiome compositions are consistent across individual colonies from four P. globosa strains, whether similar microbiomes are re-recruited after antibiotic treatment, and how microbiomes affect P. globosa growth under limiting conditions. Results illuminated a core colonial P. globosa microbiome--including bacteria from the orders Alteromonadales, Burkholderiales, and Rhizobiales--that was re-recruited after microbiome disruption. Consistent microbiome composition and recruitment is indicative that P. globosa microbiomes are stable-state systems undergoing deterministic community assembly and suggests there are specific, beneficial interactions between Phaeocystis and bacteria. Growth experiments with axenic and nonaxenic cultures demonstrated that microbiomes allowed continued growth when B-vitamins were withheld, but that microbiomes accelerated culture collapse when nitrogen was withheld. In sum, this study reveals interactions between Phaeocystis colonies and microbiome bacteria that could influence large-scale phytoplankton bloom dynamics and biogeochemical cycles.",

In addition, accurate detection of virus-infected cells and released virus particles is needed to study virus replication and to profile new candidate antiviral drugs. Here, by flow cytometry, we detect SARS-CoV-2 infection at single cell level and distinguish infected Vero E6 cells from uninfected bystander cells.

Inhibition of human mitoribosome can be caused by antimicrobial off-target binding, which leads to clinical appearances.

Previously, we reported mitochondria-specific aspects of translation related to specialties of the human mitoribosome (Aibara et al., 2020). In this Research advance article, we report 2.23-[A] resolution structure of the human mitoribosomal small subunit in complex with streptomycin. The structural data reveals new details of the streptomycin interactions, including specific water molecules and metal ions involved in the coordination. The density for the streptose moiety reveals that previously modeled aldehyde group appears as a loosely bound density, and the hydroxyl group is not resolved. The density replacing the aldehyde group is within hydrogen bonding distance of four phosphate groups of rRNA, suggesting that the ribosome-bound streptomycin is likely to be in the hydrated gem-diol form rather than in the free aldehyde form. Since streptomycin is a widely used drug for treatment, the newly resolved fine features can serve as determinants for targeting.",

    "abstract": "In diverse cells from bacterial to mammalian species, inorganic phosphate is stored in long chains called polyphosphates (polyP). These near universal polymers, ranging from 3 to thousands of phosphate moieties in length, are associated with molecular functions including energy homeostasis, protein folding, and cell signaling. In many cell types, polyphosphate is concentrated in subcellular compartments or organelles. In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, polyP synthesis by the membrane-bound VTC complex is coupled to its translocation into the lumen of the vacuole, a lysosome-related organelle, where it is stored at high concentrations. In contrast, ectopic expression of bacterial polyphosphate kinase, PPK, results in the toxic accumulation of polyP outside of the vacuole. In this study, we used label-free mass spectrometry to investigate the mechanisms underlying this toxicity. We find that PPK expression results in the activation of a stress response mediated in part by the Hog1 and Yak1 kinases, and Msn2/Msn4 transcription factors. This response is countered by the combined action of the Ddp1 and Ppx1 polyphosphatases that function together to counter polyP accumulation and downstream toxicity. In contrast, ectopic expression of previously proposed mammalian polyphosphatases did not impact PPK-mediated toxicity in this model, suggesting either that these enzymes do not function directly as polyphosphatases in vivo or that they require co-factors unique to higher eukaryotes. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation for why polyP accumulation outside of lysosome-related organelles is toxic. Further, it serves as a resource for exploring how polyP may impact conserved biological processes at a molecular level.",

    "abstract": "End stage liver disease and liver failure occur primarily as a consequence of progressive fibrosis resulting from chronic liver injury. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary cell type responsible for production of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms the fibrotic scar. While the essential role of HSCs is understood, there remain no treatments that target HSCs to inhibit the development or progression of fibrosis. We have performed analysis of the transcriptome of human HSCs to define the long noncoding (lnc) RNAs expressed in this cell type, including many not previously annotated. Through analysis of full-length RNA transcripts, we identified additional lncRNAs that were not assembled by short reads. We also discovered new isoforms of proteincoding genes that encode amino acid sequences that are not present in annotated isoforms. Analysis of non-polyadenylated RNAs did not identify additional genes encoding long noncoding RNA transcripts, but did reveal the presence of hundreds of circular (circ) RNAs, including those with potential for translation. Incorporating these transcripts and genes into analysis of a published dataset of human liver fibrosis revealed the induction of lncRNAs, novel protein isoforms, and circRNAs associated with development of disease. These results identify RNAs and amino acid sequences expressed in HSCs and associated with human liver disease that may serve as therapeutic targets to inhibit fibrosis or biomarkers to benchmark progression of disease.",

    "abstract": "The basic-Helix-Loop-Helix Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) homology domain (bHLH-PAS) transcription factor (TF) family comprises critical biological sensors of physiological (hypoxia, tryptophan metabolites, neuronal activity, and appetite) and environmental (diet derived metabolites and environmental pollutants) stimuli to regulate genes involved in signal adaptation and homeostasis1. bHLH TFs bind DNA as homo or heterodimers via E-box (CANNTG) response elements, however the DNA binding specificity of the PAS domain-containing bHLH subfamily remains unresolved1. We systematically analysed cognate DNA binding hierarchies of prototypical bHLH-PAS family members (ARNT, ARNT2, HIF1, HIF2, AhR, NPAS4, SIM1) and demonstrate distinct core (NNCGTG) specificities for different heterodimer classes. The results also show that bHLH-PAS TFs bind over a large footprint 12-15bp and recognise preferential DNA sequences flanking the core. For example, specificity beyond otherwise identical core binding by SIM1 and the HIFs is mediated through N-terminal HIF-DNA interactions. We also reveal an intimate relationship between DNA shape and both core and flanking TF binding allowing motif sequence flexibility and underpinning TF binding specificity. Furthermore, DNA-shape affinity relationships revealed that novel downstream PAS-A-loop DNA interactions are associated with AT-rich sequences that lead to high-affinity binding, and that loss of this function underpins a monogenic cause of human hyperphagic obesity in a recapitulated SIM1.R171H knock-in mouse model.\n\nImportantly, models of protein-DNA binding accurately predict in vivo occupancy, while response element methylation blocks DNA binding and predicts cell type specific chromatin occupancy. These data provide a definitive and accurate map of bHLH-PAS TF specificity and target selectivity through novel flanking protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for in vivo biological function.",

    "abstract": "Targeting proteins to their correct cellular location is a fundamental process that allows them to carry out their cellular functions. Peroxisomes utilize two paralog targeting factors, Pex5 and Pex9, for proteins with a Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS1). However, in spite of their similarity, Pex9 targets only a subset of Pex5 cargo proteins. Here, we studied the properties that facilitate the targeting specificity of Pex9, both by unbiased screens and by site-directed mutagenesis of the PTS1 motifs of either binders or non-binders. We find that the binding specificity of Pex9 is largely determined by the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid preceding the PTS1 tripeptide of its cargos. This is in line with structural modeling of the PTS1-binding cavity of the two factors, showing that while Pex5 has large negative electrostatic patches at the area surrounding the PTS1 binding cavity, Pex9 is mostly hydrophobic. Our work outlines the mechanism by which targeting specificity is achieved, enabling dynamic rewiring of the peroxisomal proteome in changing metabolic needs.",

    "abstract": "In developing tissues, knowing the localization and interactors of proteins of interest is key to understanding their function. This can be challenging when the researched protein lacks reliable antibodies. Here, we combine Easi-CRISPR with in utero electroporation to tag endogenous proteins within embryonic mouse brains. This method is called Breasi-CRISPR (Brain Easi-CRISPR), and enables knock-in of both short and long epitope tag sequences in genes of interest with high efficiency. Using Breasi-CRISPR, we were able to visualize epitope tagged proteins known to have either high or low expression levels, such as ACTB, LMNB1, EMD, FMRP, NOTCH1, and RPL22. Detection was possible by immunohistochemistry as soon as one day after electroporation at embryonic day 13 (E13). Two and five days after electroporation, we observed efficient gene editing in up to 50% of electroporated cells. Moreover, tagged proteins could be detected by immunoblotting in lysates from individual cortices two days after electroporation. Next, we demonstrated that Breasi-CRISPR enables the tagging of proteins with fluorophores in an efficient manner, allowing the visualization of endogenous proteins via live-imaging in organotypic brain slices two days after electroporation. Finally, we used Breasi-CRISPR to perform co-IP mass-spectrometry analyses of tagged autism-related protein FMRP to discover its interactome in the embryonic cortex. Together, these data show Breasi-CRISPR is a powerful tool with diverse applications that will propel the understanding of protein function in neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of eukaryotes preserve a striking diversity of ancient viruses in the form of endogenous viral elements (EVEs). Study of this genomic fossil record provides insights into the diversity, origin and evolution of viruses across geological timescales. In particular, Mavericks have emerged as one of the oldest groups of viruses infecting vertebrates ([&ge;]419 My). They have been found in the genomes of fish, amphibians and non-avian reptiles but had been overlooked in mammals. Thus, their evolutionary history and the causes of their demise in mammals remain puzzling questions. Here, we conduct a detailed evolutionary study of two Maverick-like integrations found on human chromosomes 7 and 8. We performed a comparative analysis of the integrations and determined their orthology across placental mammals (Eutheria) via the syntenic arrangement of neighbouring genes. The integrations were absent at the orthologous sites in the genomes of marsupials and monotremes. These observations allowed us to reconstruct a time-calibrated phylogeny and infer the age of their most recent common ancestor at 268.61 (199.70-344.54) My. In addition, we estimate the age of the individual integrations at ~105 My which represent the oldest non-retroviral EVEs found in the human genome. Our findings suggest that active Mavericks existed in the ancestors of modern mammals ~172 My ago (Jurassic Period) and potentially to the end of the Early Cretaceous. We hypothesise Mavericks could have gone extinct in mammals from the evolution of an antiviral defence system or from reduced opportunities for transmission in terrestrial hosts.\n\nImportanceThe genomes of vertebrates preserve an enormous diversity of endogenous viral elements (remnants of ancient viruses that accumulate in host genomes over evolutionary time). Although retroviruses account for the vast majority of these elements, diverse DNA viruses have also been found and novel lineages are being described. Here we analyse two elements found in the human genome belonging to an ancient group of DNA viruses called Mavericks. We study their evolutionary history, finding that the elements are shared between humans and many different species of placental mammals. These observations suggest the elements inserted at least ~105 Mya in the most recent common ancestor of placentals. We further estimate the age of the viral ancestor around 268 My. Our results provide evidence for some of the oldest viral integrations in the human genome and insights into the ancient interactions of viruses with the ancestors of modern-day mammals.",

However, the extent of RNA virus phenotypic evolution within epidemics and the resulting effects on fitness and virulence remain mostly unknown. Here, we screened the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in the Americas for lineage-specific fitness differences. We engineered a library of recombinant viruses representing twelve major Zika virus lineages and used them to measure replicative fitness within disease-relevant human primary cells and live mosquitoes. We found that two of these lineages conferred significant in vitro replicative fitness changes among human primary cells, but we did not find fitness changes in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Additionally, we found evidence for elevated levels of positive selection among five amino acid sites that define major Zika virus lineages. While our work suggests that Zika virus may have acquired several phenotypic changes during a short time scale, these changes were relatively moderate and do not appear to have enhanced virulence or transmission during the epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is one of the most prominent causes of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), contributory to infecting people from all age groups - a majority of which comprises infants and children. The implicated severe RSV infections lead to numerous deaths of multitudes of the overall population, predominantly the children, every year. Consequently, despite several distinctive efforts to develop a vaccine against the RSV as a potential countermeasure, there is no approved or licensed vaccine available yet, to control the RSV infection effectively. Therefore, through the utilization of immunoinformatics tools, a computational approach was taken in this study, to design and construct a multi-epitope polyvalent vaccine against the RSV-A and RSV-B strains of the virus. Potential predictions of the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were followed by extensive tests of antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, conservancy, homology to human proteome, transmembrane topology, and cytokine-inducing ability. The most promising epitopes (i.e. 13 CTL epitopes, 9 HTL epitopes, and 10 LBL epitopes) exhibiting full conservancy were then selected for designing the peptide fusion with appropriate linkers, having hBD-3 as the adjuvant. The peptide vaccine was modeled, refined, and validated to further improve the structural attributes. Following this, molecular docking analysis with specific TLRs was carried out which revealed excellent interactions and global binding energies. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted which ensured the stability of the interactions between vaccine and TLR. Furthermore, mechanistic approaches to imitate and predict the potential immune response generated by the administration of vaccines were determined through immune simulations. Owing to an overall evaluation, in silico cloning was carried out in efforts to generate recombinant pETite plasmid vectors for subsequent mass production of the vaccine peptide, incorporated within E.coli. However, more in vitro and in vivo experiments can further validate its efficacy against RSV infections.",

    "abstract": "The vieSAB operon regulates motility, biofilm formation and cholera toxin production in the classical biotype of V. cholerae. Classical biotype mutants lacking the cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase and response regulator vieA or its cognate sensor kinase vieS fail to effectively colonize the infant mouse small intestine, are less motile than the wild-type strain, and are hyper-biofilm formers. However, deletion of vieA or vieS in the currently-circulating El Tor biotype does not have a demonstrable effect on these phenotypes. To begin to understand the role of vieSAB in the El Tor biotype, we studied its regulation and the effect of vieA expression on bacterial physiology, separating the functional roles of VieAs enzymatic and DNA-binding activities. We identify bile salts and N-acetylglucosamine, which can be found at high concentration in the small intestine, as stimulating expression of vieSAB during in vitro growth. We show that, in contrast to many response regulators, VieA does not regulate its own expression. Together, these data indicate that V. cholerae upregulates vieSAB in response to small-intestinal signals, allowing VieA to alter the physiology of the cell through its transcriptional regulation and cyclic-di-GMP signaling activities in order to adapt to the human host.",

This minimal gap-junctional motoneuron network suffices to translate unpatterned premotor input into stereotyped firing sequences which are conserved across species and generate stable wingbeat power.
