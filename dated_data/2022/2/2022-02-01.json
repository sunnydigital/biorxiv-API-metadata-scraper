    "abstract": "Cocaine use and overdose deaths attributed to cocaine have increased significantly in the United States in the last 10 years. Despite the prevalence of cocaine use disorder (CUD) and the personal and societal problems it presents, there are currently no approved pharmaceutical treatments. The absence of treatment options is due, in part, to our lack of knowledge about the etiology of CUDs. There is ample evidence that genetics plays a role in increasing CUD risk but thus far, very few risk genes have been identified in human studies. Genetic studies in mice have been extremely useful for identifying genetic loci and genes, but have been limited to very few genetic backgrounds, leaving substantial phenotypic and genetic diversity unexplored.\n\nHerein we report the measurement of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization using a 19-day protocol that captures baseline locomotor activity, acute locomotor response to cocaine and locomotor sensitization across 5 exposures to the drug. These behaviors were measured in 51 genetically diverse yet tractable Collaborative Cross (CC) strains along with their inbred founder strains. The CC was generated by crossing 8 genetically diverse inbred strains such that each inbred CC strain has genetic contributions from each of the founder strains. Inbred CC mice are infinitely reproducible and provide a stable, yet diverse genetic platform on which to study the genetic architecture and genetic correlations among phenotypes.\n\nWe have identified significant differences in cocaine locomotor sensitivity and behavioral sensitization across the panel of CC strains and their founders. We have established relationships among cocaine sensitization behaviors and identified extreme responding strains that can be used in future studies aimed at understanding the genetic, biological and pharmacological mechanisms that drive addiction-related behaviors. Finally, we have determined that these behaviors exhibit relatively robust heritability making them amenable to future genetic mapping studies to identify addiction risk genes and genetic pathways that can be studied as potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Plankton community models are critical tools for understanding the processes that shape marine plankton communities, how plankton communities impact biogeochemical cycles, and the feedbacks between community structure and function. Here, using the flexible Marine Biogeochemistry Library (MARBL), we present the Size-based Plankton Ecological TRAits (MARBL-SPECTRA) model, which is designed to represent a diverse plankton community while remaining computationally tractable. MARBL-SPECTRA is composed of nine phytoplankton and six zooplankton size classes represented using allometric scaling relationships for physiological traits and interactions within multiple functional types. MARBL-SPECTRA is embedded within the global ocean component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and simulates large-scale, emergent patterns in phytoplankton growth limitation, plankton phenology, plankton generation time, and trophic transfer efficiency. The model qualitatively reproduces observed global patterns of surface nutrients, chlorophyll biomass, net primary production, and the biogeographies of a range of plankton size classes. In addition, the model simulates how predator:prey dynamics and trophic efficiency vary across gradients in total ecosystem productivity. Shorter food chains that export proportionally more carbon from the surface to the ocean interior occur in productive, eutrophic regions, whereas in oligotrophic regions, the food chains are relatively long and export less organic matter from the surface. The union of functional type modeling with size-resolved, trait-based modeling approaches allows MARBL-SPECTRA to capture both large-scale elemental cycles and the structure of planktonic food webs affecting trophic transfer efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Interest in CRISPR diagnostics continues to increase. CRISPR-Cas12 and -Cas13 based detection are particularly interesting as they enable highly specific detection of nucleic acids. The fundamental sensitivity limits of Cas12 and Cas13 enzymes are governed by their kinetic rates and are critical to develop amplification-free assays. However, these kinetic rates remain poorly understood and their reporting has been inconsistent. We here measure kinetic parameters for several enzymes (LbCas12a, AsCas12a, AapCas12b, LwaCas13a and LbuCas13a) and evaluate their limits of detection (LoD) for amplification-free target detection. Collectively, we here present quantitation of enzyme kinetics for 14 gRNAs and nucleic acid targets for a total of 50 sets of kinetic rate parameters and 25 LoDs. Importantly, we also validate the self-consistency our measurements by comparing trends and limiting behaviors with a Michaelis-Menten, trans-cleavage reaction kinetics model. Our measurements reveal that activated Cas12 and Cas13 enzymes exhibit typical trans-cleavage catalytic efficiencies between order 105 and 106 M-1 s-1. Moreover, for assays that use fluorescent reporter molecules (ssDNA and ssRNA) for target detection, we find most CRISPR enzymes have an amplification-free LoD in the picomolar range. We find also that successful detection of target requires cleavage (by activated CRISPR enzyme) of at least ~0.1% of the fluorescent reporter molecules. This fraction of cleaved reporters is required to differentiate signal from background, and we hypothesize that this fraction is largely independent of the detection method (i.e., endpoint vs reaction velocity). Our results provide a map of the feasible application range and highlight areas of improvement for the emerging field of CRISPR diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Injectable hydrogels are biomaterials that can be administered minimally invasively in liquid form, and are considered promising artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) materials. However, ordinary injectable hydrogels are synthesized from water-soluble molecules to ensure injectability, resulting in nonphase-separated structures, making them structurally different from natural ECMs with phase-separated insoluble structural proteins, such as collagen and elastin. Here, we propose a simple material design approach to impart phase-separated structures to injectable hydrogels by adding inorganic salts. Injecting a gelling solution of mutually crosslinkable tetra-arm poly(ethylene glycol)s with potassium sulfate at optimal concentrations results in the formation of a hydrogel with phase-separated structures in situ. These phase-separated structures provide up to an 8-fold increase in fracture toughness while allowing the encapsulation of live mouse chondrogenic cells without compromising their proliferative activity. Our findings highlight that the concentration of inorganic salts is an important design parameter in injectable hydrogels for artificial ECMs.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeChronic active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are characterized by a paramagnetic rim at the edge of the lesion and are associated with increased disability in patients. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MRI technique that is sensitive to chronic active lesions, termed rim+ lesions on the QSM. We present QSMRim-Net, a data imbalance-aware deep neural network that fuses lesion-level radiomic and convolutional image features for automated identification of rim+ lesions on QSM.\n\nMethodsQSM and T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI of the brain were collected at 3T for 172 MS patients. Rim+ lesions were manually annotated by two human experts, followed by consensus from a third expert, for a total of 177 rim+ and 3986 rim negative (rim-) lesions. Our automated rim+ detection algorithm, QSMRim-Net, consists of a two-branch feature extraction network and a synthetic minority oversampling network to classify rim+ lesions. The first network branch is for image feature extraction from the QSM and T2-FLAIR, and the second network branch is a fully connected network for QSM lesion-level radiomic feature extraction. The oversampling network is designed to increase classification performance with imbalanced data.\n\nResultsOn a lesion-level, in a five-fold cross validation framework, the proposed QSMRim-Net detected rim+ lesions with a partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pROC AUC) of 0.760, where clinically relevant false positive rates of less than 0.1 were considered. The method attained an area under the precision recall curve (PR AUC) of 0.704. QSMRim-Net out-performed other state-of-the-art methods applied to the QSM on both pROC AUC and PR AUC. On a subject-level, comparing the predicted rim+ lesion count and the human expert annotated count, QSMRim-Net achieved the lowest mean square error of 0.98 and the highest correlation of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.92).\n\nConclusionThis study develops a novel automated deep neural network for rim+ MS lesion identification using T2-FLAIR and QSM images.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic nuclei, individual chromosomes occupy discrete three-dimensional spaces with little overlap. Dynamic chromatin organization instantly influences DNA accessibility through modulating local macromolecular density and interactions, driving changes in transcription activities. Chromatin anchoring to nuclear landmarks often leads to massive reorganization and motion changes. Chromatin dynamics has been reported to be locally confined but contributes to the large-scale coherent chromatin motion across the entire nucleus. However, the dynamics and compaction of chromosomal sub-regions along a single chromosome are not well-understood. In this study, we combined quantitative real-time single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, CRISPR-based genomic labeling, biophysical analysis and polymer models to characterize the dynamics of specific genomic loci and chromatin-nuclear landmark interactions on human chromosome 19 in living cells. Precise genomic labeling allows us to dissect loci motions and chromatin elasticity on a single chromosome basis. We found that the dynamics of genomic loci were all subdiffusive but varied at different regions along the chromosome. The mobility of genomic loci was similar among interior chromosomal loci but deviated for the loci at pericentromeric and near-telomeric regions. Tighter compaction on chromosome 19 long arm, compared to the short arm was observed, which may correlate to more active genes on the short arm than the long arm, shown by our RNA-seq analysis. The strong tethering interaction was found for loci at the pericentromeric region, suggesting a higher degree of local condensation, perhaps through stronger interactions or association between pericentromeric regions and their microenvironments, such as chromatin-nuclear body association through sequence-specific domains on DNA.",

    "abstract": "The JAK family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases includes four subtypes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) and is responsible for signal transduction downstream of diverse cytokine receptors. JAK inhibitors have emerged as important therapies for immuno(onc)ological disorders, but their use is limited by undesirable side effects presumed to arise from poor subtype selectivity, a common challenge for inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding pocket of kinases. Here, we describe the chemical proteomic discovery of a druggable allosteric cysteine present in the non-catalytic pseudokinase domain of JAK1 (C817) and TYK2 (C838), but absent from JAK2 or JAK3. Electrophilic compounds selectively engaging this site block JAK1-dependent transphosphorylation and cytokine signaling, while appearing to act largely as \"silent\" ligands for TYK2. Importantly, the allosteric JAK1 inhibitors do not impair JAK2-dependent cytokine signaling and are inactive in cells expressing a C817A JAK1 mutant. Our findings thus reveal an allosteric approach for inhibiting JAK1 with unprecedented subtype selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria that secret plant growth promoting substances are good candidate for field application to improve crop yield. Especially, bacteria that excrete auxin can enhance root growth and settlement of crops to help adapting new soil environment when transplanted. In this study, we applied culture supernatant of an auxin producing bacteria Ignatzschineria sp. CG20001. The bacterial culture supernatant (BCS) was applied in combination with chicken manure and liquid chemical fertilizer. The treatment of bacterial culture supernatant enhanced growth of red kohlrabi, Brassica oleraceae var. gongyloides, especially in combination with chicken manure. To understand mechanisms related higher growth, we compared photosynthetic efficiency by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence and light harvesting antenna pigments composition. The performance index PS II was higher in BCS treated plants, and recovered faster after leaf harvest. Photoprotective mechanism was also increased in BCS treated plants, however, and DTT infiltration, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) reduced to similar level, implying higher xanthophyll cycle dependent NPQ induction mechanism in BCS treated plants. However, in liquid chemical fertilized plants, BCS treated and non-treated plants showed the opposite pattern in the change of NPQ. The chlorophyll a/b ratio was highest in no-fertilized non-treated control, and lowest in chicken manure and BCS combination, implying impact of nutrition availability between the two groups. Through these results, we conclude that the appropriate combination of organic fertilizer and plant growth promoting bacterial metabolite can improve plant growth more than chemical fertilizers. This study also provides physiological understanding for strategic fertilization regime of organic fertilizer and biofertilizer combination.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is the primary risk factor for AD; however, there is a poor understanding of the biological mechanisms by which the ageing process contributes to the development of AD in some individuals, while others progress to advanced age with relatively little AD neuropathology. To halt the progression of AD, the preclinical stage of neurodegeneration (before the onset of clinical symptoms) is anticipated to be the more effective time point for applying potentially disease-modifying interventions in AD. The main objective of this study was to understand the age and disease related proteomic changes are detectable in plasma, based on retrospective analysis of longitudinal data and cross-sectional analyses of clinically diagnosed cases. We conducted an in-depth plasma proteomics analysis using intensive depletion of high-abundant plasma proteins using the Agilent multiple affinity removal liquid chromatography (LC) column-Human 14 (Hu14) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) technique. In this study, we have begun to address the following questions; (1) differences in plasma proteomic profiles between normal ageing, vs ageing with progress to cognitive decline (MCI) or disease (dementia, probable AD), (2) cross-sectional analysis of baseline data, when all subjects are clinically identified as cognitively normal, provides insight into the preclinical changes which precede subsequent progression to AD and potentially provide early biomarkers, and (3) comparison of plasma at the point of progression to clinically diagnosed onset of cognitive decline or AD, can provide potential plasma biomarkers to facilitate clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, our findings also identified some proteins previously discovered in AD CSF and brain proteomics signatures that could provide clinically meaningful information. We identified differentially expressed proteins which were associated with several biological and molecular processes that may serve as therapeutic targets and fluid biomarkers for the disease.",

The induction of high-titer, potent neutralizing antibodies cannot completely inhibit breakthrough infection and enhanced respiratory disease (ERD), encouraging a focus on the relationship between virus intercellular spread and neutralizing antibodies. By blocking the known intercellular spread modes and with the aid of ultrahigh-resolution imaging, we observed a new efficient mode of intercellular spread in which RSV-infected cells directly transfer viral materials (including viral replication factories) to neighboring cells through protruding open-ended microfilament-rich intercellular nanotubes. The new mode is virion-independent and antibody-insensitive, beginning as early as 3 h post infection. Furthermore, replication-defective viral genomes (DVGs) might also utilize the new mode, facilitating the establishment of latent viral infections. Therefore, our data provide a new perspective on RSV cell-to-cell spread and might help to explain the immune escape and latent persistence of paramyxoviruses.",

However, bsAb with the IgG-(scFv)2 design (14-H-06) but not the CrossMAb design (14-crs-06) increases antigen-binding and virus-neutralizing activities and spectrum against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants including the Omicron, than the cocktail. X-ray crystallography and computational simulations reveal distinct neutralizing mechanisms for individual cocktail antibodies and suggest higher inter-spike crosslinking potentials by 14-H-06 than 14-crs-06. In mouse models of infections by SARS-CoV-2 and the Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants, 14-H-06 exhibits higher or equivalent therapeutic efficacy than the cocktail.

    "abstract": "In commercial farming systems, chicks are reared without a mother. This absence of maternal influence can cause welfare problems when the chicks become older. Chicks imprint on their mothers they are young, and this mediates their stress and fear response. It is important to recognise problems early in the development of chicks to avoid welfare issues when they are older. One way to assess welfare is by measuring affective states. Research has shown chickens can display empathy, both towards their offspring and towards conspecifics. Measures of negative and positive affective states, either behavioural or physiological, could be good welfare indicators. This study employed non-invasive methods to measure affective states in laying hen chicks. Using video and thermal imaging, it analysed temperature changes in the peripheral areas and head region as well as changes in blinking behaviour before and after exposure to a stressor. The prediction was that the temperature would decrease in the eye and peripheral regions in response to a stressor and that the blinking rate would decrease. These changes would be indicative of a negative affective state. The results showed that the eye temperature as well as the blinking rate both decreased, whereas the temperature in the head region and the beak area increased. These results could be indicative of a negative affective state.",

Using a cellular model for neo-vessel formation, we could show that newly formed vascular structures emanated from the embedded aggregates, consisting of mesenchymal stem cells co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, into the avascular HPL-based matrices bridging distances up to 5 mm to join with adjacent aggregates with the same morphology forming an interconnected network. These newly formed vascular sprouts showed branch points and generated a lumen as sign of mature vascular development. Mesenchymal stem cells in fluid phase could bind to and interact with adherent human umbilical vein endothelial cells when a shear-force of 2 dyne/mm2 was applied in the flow chamber using a Bioflux(R)200 device. Under these conditions, mesenchymal stem cells bind to human umbilical vein endothelial cells previously damaged by laser beam irradiation to interact and shed particles.\n\nIn conclusion, we observed that mesenchymal stem cells support human umbilical vein endothelial cells to form new vessels in HPL-based matrices when co-cultured in spherical aggregates to generate complex vascular networks in a primarily avascular scaffold and bind to the damaged cells under shear-force to eventually aid in their regeneration.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvery year, more than 12 million people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer(CRC), and more than 600,000 people die from it, making it second most deadly form of cancer.This work analyzes differential gene expression across CRC and other glandular tumour samples to identify expression changes potentially contributing to the development of CRC tumorogenesis.\n\nMethodsThis work defines 13 gene signatures representing four CRC tumour and 10 other glandular tumours that are colonic by origin.Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is used to define positive and negative CRC gene panels from GSEA-identified leading-edge genes using two CRC signatures. GSEA then is used to verify enrichment and leading-edge gene membership of CRC panels in two independent CRC gene signatures. Analysis is then extended to four individual and 10 glandular tumour signatures. Genes most associated with CRC tumorogenesis are predicted by intersecting membership of GSEA-identified leading-edges across signatures.\n\nResultsSignificant enrichment is observed between CRC gene identification signatures, from which the positive (55 genes) and negative (77 genes) CRC panels are defined. Non-random significant enrichment is observed between CRC gene panels and verification signatures, from which 54 over- and 72 under-expressed genes are shared across leading-edges. Considering other glandular tumour samples individually and in combination with CRC, significant non-random enrichment is observed across these signatures. Eight solute carrier family genes such as (SLC25A32, SLC22A3, SLC25A20, SLC36A1, SLC26A3,SLC9A2, SLC4A4 and SLC26A2) from the CRC panel were shared commonly across all the gene signatures leading-edges, regardless of the colonic tumour type.\n\nConclusionThis meta-analysis identifies gene expression changes associated with the process of CRC tumorogenesis. These changes may contribute to developing therapeutic treatments available for CRC patients.",

    "abstract": "Error correction is the canonical first step in long-read sequencing data analysis. The current standard is to make use of a consensus sequence as a template. However, in mixed samples, such as metagenomes or organisms of higher ploidy, consensus induced biases can mask true variants affecting haplotypes of lower frequencies, because they are mistaken as errors.\n\nThe novelty presented here is to use graph based, instead of sequence based consensus as a template for identifying errors. The advantage is that graph based reference systems also capture variants of lower frequencies, so do not mistakenly mask them as errors. We present VeChat, as a novel approach to implement this idea: VeChat distinguishes errors from haplotype-specific true variants based on variation graphs, which reflect a popular type of data structure for pangenome reference systems. Upon initial construction of an ad-hoc variation graph from the raw input reads, nodes and edges that are due to errors are pruned from that graph by way of an iterative procedure that is based on principles from frequent itemset mining. Upon termination, the graph exclusively contains nodes and edges reflecting true sequential phenomena. Final re-alignments of the raw reads indicate where and how reads need to be corrected.\n\nExtensive benchmarking experiments demonstrate that PacBio and ONT reads corrected by VeChat contain 4 to 15, or, respectively, 2 to 10 times less errors than when corrected state of the art approaches. VeChat is implemented in an easy-to-use open-source tool and publicly available at https://github.com/HaploKit/vechat.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are subcellular organelles present in almost all eukaryotic cells, which play a central role in cellular metabolism. Different tissues, health and age conditions are characterised by a difference in mitochondrial structure and composition. The visual data mining platform mitoXplorer 1.0 was developed to explore the expression dynamics of genes associated with mitochondrial functions that could help explain these differences. It however lacked functions aimed at integrating mitochondria in the cellular context and thus, identifying regulators that help mitochondria adapt to cellular needs. To fill this gap, we upgraded the mitoXplorer platform to version 2.0 (mitoXplorer 2.0). In this upgrade we implemented two novel integrative functions, Network Analysis and the transcription factor- (TF-) Enrichment, to specifically help identify signalling or transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial processes. In addition, we implemented several other novel functions to allow the platform to go beyond simple data visualisation, such as an enrichment function for mitochondrial processes, a function to explore time-series data, the possibility to compare datasets across species as well as an IDconverter to help facilitate data upload. We demonstrate the usefulness of these functions in 3 specific use cases. mitoXplorer 2.0 is freely available without login at http://mitoxplorer2.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr.",

Therefore it has become an important information while it helps giving a more specialized and more efficient treatment for each patient. Detection of mutation is routinely made by DNA-sequencing diagnostic tests. Recently, a new strategy of deep learning based method of prediction of mutation from histopathological images has shown promising results. However it is still unknown whether these methods can be useful as screening tests aside from sequencing methods for efficient population diagnosis. Here we developed our own deep learning based prediction pipeline for the detection of mutation in breast, lung, colon and ovarian cancer and find clinically relevant genes that have easy-to-detect mutational status, and especially TP53 which can be detected in these four tumors.

We examined expression of cilia T2Rs and both host and bacterial responses to T2R14 agonist diphenhydramine.\n\nMETHODUsing cultured human nasal epithelial cells grown at air liquid interface, we measured expression of T2Rs via qPCR. We measured effects of diphenhydramine on ciliary beat frequency via high-speed imaging and nitric oxide production via fluorescent dye DAF-FM. We measured effects of diphenhydramine on growth of lab and clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We measured biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa using crystal violet staining and surface attachment of P. aeruginosa to cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CBFE41o-) cells using CFU counting.\n\nRESULTST2R expression increased with mucocilliary differentiation and did not vary between CF and non-CF ALIs. Treatment with P. aeruginosa flagellin decreased expression of diphenhydramine-responsive T2R14 and 40, among other isoforms. Diphenhydramine increased both NO and CBF. Increases in CBF were disrupted after flagellin treatment. Diphenhydramine impaired growth, biofilm production, and surface attachment of P. aeruginosa.\n\nCONCLUSIONST2R expression is similar between normal and CF cells but decreases with flagellin treatment. Utilizing T2R agonists as therapeutics within the context of CF, P. aeruginosa infections may require co-treatment with anti-inflammatories to prevent the reduction of T2R expression with TLR activation. T2R agonist diphenhydramine increases NO production and CBF while also decreasing bacterial growth and biofilm production, and thus diphenhydramine or derivate compounds may have potential clinical usefulness in CF infections as a topical therapy.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIT2R14 agonist diphenhydramine increases nitric oxide production and cilia beating\nC_LIO_LIFlagellin decreases T2R14 expression in primary airway epithelial cells\nC_LIO_LIT2R14 agonist Diphenhydramine inhibits Pseudomonas growth and biofilm formation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "As the most abundant cation in archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic cells, potassium (K+) is an essential element for life. While much is known about the machinery of transcellular and paracellular K transport - channels, pumps, co-transporters, and tight-junction proteins - many quantitative aspects of K homeostasis in biological systems remain poorly constrained. Here we present measurements of the stable isotope ratios of potassium (41K/39K) in three biological systems (algae, fish, and mammals). When considered in the context of our current understanding of potential mechanisms of K isotope fractionation and K+ transport in these biological systems, our results provide evidence that the fractionation of K isotopes depends on transport pathway and transmembrane transport machinery. Specifically, we find that passive transport of K+ down its electrochemical potential through channels and pores in tight-junctions at favors 39K, a result which we attribute to a kinetic isotope effect associated with dehydration and/or size selectivity at the channel/pore entrance. In contrast, we find that transport of K+ against its electrochemical gradient via pumps and co-transporters is associated with less/no isotopic fractionation, a result that we attribute to small equilibrium isotope effects that are expressed in pumps/co-transporters due to their slower turnover rate and the relatively long residence time of K+ in the ion pocket. These results indicate that stable K isotopes may be able to provide quantitative constraints on transporter-specific K+ fluxes (e.g. the fraction of K efflux from a tissue by channels vs. co-transporters) and how these fluxes change under different physiological states. In addition, precise determination of K isotope effects associated with K+ transport through channels, pumps, and co-transporters may provide unique constraints on the mechanisms of K transport that could be tested with steered molecular dynamic simulations.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia and states induced by certain psychotomimetic drugs may share some physiological and phenomenological properties, but they differ in fundamental ways: one is a crippling chronic mental disease, while the others are temporary, pharmacologically-induced states presently being explored as treatments for mental illnesses. Building towards a deeper understanding of these different alterations of normal consciousness, here we compare the changes in neural dynamics induced by LSD and ketamine (in healthy volunteers) against those associated with schizophrenia, as observed in resting-state M/EEG recordings. While both conditions exhibit increased neural signal diversity, our findings reveal that this is accompanied by an increased transfer entropy from the front to the back of the brain in schizophrenia, versus an overall reduction under the two drugs. Furthermore, we show that these effects can be reproduced via different alterations of standard Bayesian inference applied on a computational model based on the predictive processing framework. In particular, the effects observed under the drugs are modelled as a reduction of the precision of the priors, while the effects of schizophrenia correspond to an increased precision of sensory information. These findings shed new light on the similarities and differences between schizophrenia and two psychotomimetic drug states, and have potential implications for the study of consciousness and future mental health treatments.",

The complex system-level mechanisms of IFN signaling are however not well understood. Here, we show that in cells transfected with an analog of viral RNA, poly(I:C), transcriptional activity of STAT1/2 is terminated due to depletion of the interferon {beta} (IFN{beta}) receptor, IFNAR. Two ISGs, RNase L and PKR, not only hinder replenishment of IFNAR, but also suppress negative regulators of IRF3 and NF-{kappa}B, consequently promoting IFN{beta} transcription. We incorporated these findings into a comprehensive mathematical model of innate immunity. By coupling signaling through the IRF3/NF-{kappa}B and STAT1/2 pathways with the activity of RNase L and PKR, the model explains how poly(I:C) switches the transcriptional program from STAT1/2-induced to IRF3/NF-{kappa}B-induced, turning IFN{beta}-responding cells to IFN{beta}-secreting cells.\n\nOne-sentence summaryA computational model explains how non-self RNA turns cells from IFN{beta}- responders to IFN{beta}-producers.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a neurostimulation technique based on the principle of electromagnetic induction of an electric field in the brain with both research and clinical applications. To produce an optimal neuro-modulatory effect, the TMS coil must be placed on the head and oriented accurately with respect to the region of interest within the brain. A robotic method can enhance the accuracy and facilitate the procedure for TMS coil placement. This work presents two system improvements for robot-assisted TMS (RA-TMS) application. Previous systems have used outside-in tracking method where a stationary external infrared (IR) tracker is used as a reference point to track the head and TMS coil position. This method is prone to losing track of the coil or the head if the IR camera is blocked by the robotic arm during its motion. To address this issue, we implemented an inside-out tracking method by mounting a portable IR camera on the robot end-effector. This method guarantees that the line of sight of the IR camera is not obscured by the robotic arm at any time during its motion. We also integrated a portable projection mapping device (PPMD) into the RA-TMS system to provide visual guidance during TMS application. PPMD can track the head via an IR tracker, and can project a planned contact point of the TMS coil on the head or overlay the underlying brain anatomy in real-time.",

Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was implemented to study racial ancestry of the accessions in comparison to a global sorghum diversity set and characterize sub-groups and admixture in the Ugandan germplasm. Genetic structure and phylogenetic analysis was conducted to identify distinct genotypes in the Ugandan collection and relationships among groups. Furthermore, in a case study for identification of potentially useful adaptive trait variation for breeding, we performed genome-wide association studies for juvenile cold tolerance. Genomic regions potentially involved in adaptation of Ugandan sorghum varieties to cooler climatic conditions were identified that could be of interest for expansion of sorghum production into temperate latitudes.
