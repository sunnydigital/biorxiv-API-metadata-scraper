    "abstract": "Using single-cell RNA sequencing, it is now possible to get the detailed gene expression pattern in each cell for millions of cells in a single experiment under varying conditions. Annotating cells by assigning a type or state to them is important for correct interpretation of results. In spite of current advances in technology, assigning cell types in single-cell datasets remains a bottleneck due to the lack of a comprehensive reference database and an accurate search method in a single tool. CellKb Immune is a knowledgebase of manually collected, curated and annotated marker gene sets representing cell types in the immune response in mouse. It allows users to find matching cell types in literature given a list of genes. We evaluated the contents and search methodology of CellKb Immune using a leave-one-out approach. We further used CellKb Immune to annotate previously defined marker gene sets from a bulk RNA-seq dataset to confirm its accuracy and coverage. CellKb Immune provides an easy-to-use online tool with a reliable method to find matching cell types and annotate cells in single-cell experiments. It is available at https://www.cellkb.com/immune.",

    "abstract": "One important approach to human brain mapping is to define a set of distinct regions that can be linked to unique functions. Numerous brain parcellations have been proposed, using cytoarchitectonic, structural or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The intrinsic smoothness of brain data, however, poses a problem for current methods seeking to compare different parcellations. For example, criteria that simply compare within-parcel to between-parcel similarity provide even random parcellations with a high value. Furthermore, the evaluation is biased by the spatial scale of the parcellation. To address this problem, we propose the Distance Controlled Boundary Coefficient (DCBC), an unbiased criterion to evaluate discrete parcellations. We employ this new criterion to evaluate existing parcellations of the human neocortex in their power to predict functional boundaries for an fMRI data set with many different tasks, as well as for resting-state data. We find that common anatomical parcellations do not perform better than chance, suggesting that task-based functional boundaries do not align well with sulcal landmarks. Parcellations based on resting-state fMRI data perform well; in some cases, as well as a parcellation defined on the evaluation data itself. Finally, multi-modal parcellations that combine functional and anatomical criteria perform substantially worse than those based on functional data alone, indicating that functionally homogeneous regions often span major anatomical landmarks. Overall, the DCBC advances the field of functional brain mapping by providing an unbiased metric that compares the predictive ability of different brain parcellations to define brain regions that are functionally maximally distinct.",

    "abstract": "Bone health is determined by factors including bone metabolism or remodeling. Wnt-10b alters osteoblastogenesis through pre-osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and osteoblast apoptosis rate, which collectively lead to the increase of bone density. To model this, we adapted a previously published model of bone remodeling. The resulting model for the bone compartment includes differential equations for active osteoclasts, pre-osteoblasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and the amount of bone present at the remodeling site. Our alterations to the original model consist of extending it past a single remodeling cycle and implementing a direct relationship to Wnt-10b. Four new parameters were estimated and validated using normalized data from mice. The model connects Wnt-10b to bone metabolism and predicts the change in trabecular bone volume caused by a change in Wnt-10b input. We find that this model predicts the expected increase in pre-osteoblasts and osteoblasts while also pointing to a decrease in osteoclasts when Wnt-10b is increased.",

    "abstract": "Sarm1 is an evolutionary conserved innate immune adaptor protein that has emerged as a primary regulator of programmed axonal degeneration over the past decade. In vitro structural insights have revealed that although Sarm1 induces energy depletion by breaking down NAD+, it is also allosterically inhibited by NAD+. However, how NAD+ levels modulate the activation of intracellular Sarm1 has not been elucidated so far. This study focuses on understanding the events leading to Sarm1 activation in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells using the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone. Here we report the regulation of rotenone-induced cell death by loss of NAD+ that may act as a \"biological trigger\" of Sarm1 activation. Our study revealed that early loss of endogenous NAD+ levels arising due to PARP1 hyperactivation preceded Sarm1 induction following rotenone treatment. Interestingly, replenishing NAD+ levels by the PARP1 inhibitor, PJ34 restored mitochondrial homeostasis and prevented subsequent Sarm1 activation in rotenone treated cells. These cellular data were further validated in Drosophila melanogaster where a significant reduction in rotenone mediated loss of locomotor abilities and reduced dSarm expression was observed in the flies following PARP inhibition. Taken together, these observations not only uncovers a novel regulation of Sarm1 induction by endogenous NAD+ levels but also point towards an important understanding on how PARP inhibitors could be repurposed in the treatment of mitochondrial complex I deficiency disorders mediated by Sarm1.",

    "abstract": "Production and emigration of neural crest cells is a transient process followed by the emergence of the definitive roof plate. The mechanisms regulating the end of neural crest ontogeny are poorly understood. Whereas early crest development is stimulated by mesoderm-derived retinoic acid, we report that the end of the neural crest period is regulated by retinoic acid synthesized in the dorsal neural tube. Inhibition of retinoic acid signaling in the neural tube prevents the normal upregulation of BMP inhibitors in the nascent roof plate and prolongs the period of BMP responsiveness which otherwise ceases close to roof plate establishment. Consequently, neural crest production and emigration are extended well into the roof plate stage. In turn, extending the activity of neural crest-specific genes inhibits the onset of retinoic acid synthesis in roof plate suggesting a mutual repressive interaction between neural crest and roof plate traits. Although several roof plate-specific genes are normally expressed in the absence of retinoic acid signaling, roof plate and crest markers are co-expressed in single cells and this domain also contains dorsal interneurons. Hence, the cellular and molecular architecture of the roof plate is compromised. Collectively, our results demonstrate that neural tube-derived retinoic acid, via inhibition of BMP signaling, is an essential factor responsible for the end of neural crest generation and the proper segregation of dorsal neural lineages.",

    "abstract": "Brains must represent the outside world so that animals survive and thrive. In early sensory systems, neural populations have diverse receptive fields structured to detect important features in inputs, yet significant variability has been ignored in classical models of sensory neurons. We model neuronal receptive fields as random, variable samples from parameterized distributions and demonstrate this model in two sensory modalities using data from insect mechanosensors and mammalian primary visual cortex. Our approach leads to a significant theoretical connection between the foundational concepts of receptive fields and random features, a leading theory for understanding artificial neural networks. The modeled neurons perform a randomized wavelet transform on inputs, which removes high frequency noise and boosts the signal. Further, these random feature neurons enable learning from fewer training samples and with smaller networks in artificial tasks. This structured random model of receptive fields provides a unifying, mathematically tractable framework to understand sensory encodings across both spatial and temporal domains.",

    "abstract": "A computational model in one dimension is proposed to position a single centrosome using astral microtubules (MTs) interacting with the cell cortex. The mechanism exploits mutually antagonistic pulling and pushing forces arising from the astral MTs binding to cortical dynein motors in the actin-rich cell cortex and their buckling while growing against the cell cortex, respectively. The underlying mechanism is extended to account for the elongation and positioning of the bipolar spindle during mitotic anaphase B. Besides astral MTs, the model for bipolar spindle involves interpolar microtubules (IPMTs). The composite model can predict spindle elongation and position under various circumstances. The outcome reveals that the bipolar spindle elongation, weakened by decreasing overlap between the antiparallel IPMTs in the spindle mid-zone, is recovered by the astral MTs. The one-dimensional models are extended in two dimensions to include the effect of cortical sliding of the astral MTs for studying the dynamics of the interphase centrosome and the anaphase B spindles in elongated cells. The results reveal that the dynamics in two dimensions stay qualitatively similar to the one dimension.",

    "abstract": "K-mer based methods are used ubiquitously in the field of computational biology. However, determining the optimal value of k for a specific application often remains heuristic. Simply reconstructing a new k-mer set with another k-mer size is computationally expensive, especially in metagenomic analysis where data sets are large. Here, we introduce a hashing-based technique that leverages a kind of bottom-m sketch as well as a k-mer ternary search tree (KTST) to obtain k-mer based similarity estimates for a range of k values. By truncating k-mers stored in a pre-built KTST with a large k = kmax value, we can simultaneously obtain k-mer based estimates for all k values up to kmax. This truncation approach circumvents the reconstruction of new k-mer sets when changing k values, making analysis more time and space-efficient. For example, we show that when using a KTST to estimate the containment index between a RefSeq-based microbial reference database and simulated metagenome data for 10 values of k, the running time is close to 10x faster compared to a classic MinHash approach while using less than one-fifth the space to store the data structure.

Here, we have studied a rare genetic disorder due to MECOM haploinsufficiency, characterized by an early-onset absence of HSCs in vivo. By generating a faithful model of this disorder in primary human HSCs and coupling functional studies with integrative single-cell genomic analyses, we uncover a key transcriptional network involving hundreds of genes that is required for HSC maintenance. Through our analyses, we nominate cooperating transcriptional regulators and identify how MECOM prevents the CTCF-dependent genome reorganization that occurs as HSCs differentiate. Strikingly, we show that this transcriptional network is co-opted in high-risk leukemias, thereby enabling these cancers to acquire stem cell properties. Collectively, we illuminate a regulatory network necessary for HSC self-renewal through the study of a rare experiment of nature.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of human right-handedness has been intensively debated for decades. Manual lateralization patterns in non-human primates have the potential to elucidate evolutionary determinants of human handedness. However, restricted species samples and inconsistent methodologies have so far limited comparative phylogenetic studies. By combining original data with published literature reports, we assembled data on hand preferences for standardized object manipulation in 1,786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans. Based on that, we employ quantitative phylogenetic methods to test prevalent hypotheses on the roles of ecology, brain size and tool use in primate handedness evolution. We confirm that human right-handedness represents an unparalleled extreme among anthropoids and found taxa displaying population-level handedness to be rare. Species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates and did not strongly correlate with any of the selected biological predictors, nor with phylogeny. In contrast, we recovered highly variable patterns of hand preference strength, which show signatures of both ecology and phylogeny. In particular, terrestrial primates tend to display weaker hand preferences than arboreal species. These results challenge popular ideas on primate handedness evolution, especially the postural origins hypothesis. Furthermore, they point to a potential adaptive benefit of disparate lateralization strength in primates, a measure of hand preference that has often been overlooked in the past. Finally, our data show that human lateralization patterns do not align with trends found among other anthropoids, suggesting that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our species.",

    "abstract": "The movement of individuals through continuous space is typically constrained by dispersal ability and dispersal barriers. A range of approaches have been developed to investigate these. KO_SCPLOWINDISPERSEC_SCPLOW is a new approach that infers intergenerational dispersal ({sigma}) from close kin dyads, and appears particularly useful for investigating taxa that are difficult to observe individually. This study, focusing on the mosquito Aedes aegypti, shows how the same close kin data can also be used for barrier detection. We empirically demonstrate this new extension of the method using genome-wide sequence data from 266 Ae. aegypti. First, we use the spatial distribution of full-sib dyads collected within one generation to infer past movements of ovipositing female mosquitoes. These dyads indicated the relative barrier strengths of two roads, and performed favourably against alternative genetic methods for detecting barriers. The difference in variance between the sib and first cousin spatial distributions was used to infer movement over the past two generations, providing estimates of intergenerational dispersal ({sigma} = 81.5-197.1 m.gen-1/2) and density ({rho} = 833-4864 km-2). Dispersal estimates showed general agreement with those from mark-release-recapture studies. Barriers, {sigma}, {rho}, and neighbourhood size (331-526) can inform forthcoming releases of dengue-suppressing Wolbachia bacteria into this mosquito population.",

In Drosophila, the timer genes are expressed broadly across much of the blastoderm, which segments simultaneously, but their expression is delayed in a small \"tail\" region, just anterior to the hindgut, which segments during germband extension. Specification of the tail and the hindgut depends on the terminal gap gene tailless, but beyond this the regulation of the timer genes is poorly understood. We used a combination of multiplexed imaging, mutant analysis, and gene network modelling to resolve the regulation of the timer genes, identifying 11 new regulatory interactions and clarifying the mechanism of posterior terminal patterning. We propose that a dynamic Tailless expression gradient modulates the intrinsic dynamics of a timer gene cross-regulatory module, delineating the tail region and delaying its developmental maturation.",

However, the extent to which diversified management actions could lead to quantitatively important changes in carbon sequestration and stocking capacity at the tree level remains to be thoroughly assessed. To that end, we used a state-of-the-science bio-geochemically based forest growth model to simulate effects of multiple forest management scenarios on net primary productivity (NPP) and potential carbon woody stocks (pCWS) under twenty scenarios of climate change in a suite of observed and virtual forest stands in temperate and boreal European forests. Previous modelling experiments indicated that the capacity of forests to assimilate and store atmospheric CO2 in woody biomass is already being attained under business-as-usual forest management practices across a range of climate change scenarios. Nevertheless, we find that on the long-term, with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and warming, managed forests show both higher productivity capacity and a larger potential pool size of stored carbon than unmanaged forests as long as thinning and tree harvesting are of moderate intensity.",

    "abstract": "Probes flashed within a moving frame are dramatically displaced (Ozkan et al, 2021; Wong &Mack, 1981). The effect is much larger than that seen on static or moving probes (induced motion, Duncker, 1929; Wallach et al, 1978). These flashed probes are often perceived with the separation they have in frame coordinates -- a 100% effect. Here we explore this frame effect on flashed tests with several versions of the standard stimulus. We find that the frame effect holds for smoothly or abruptly displacing frames, even when the frame changed shape or orientation between the endpoints of its travel. The path could be non-linear, even circular. The effect was driven by perceived not physical motion. When there were competing overlapping frames, the effect was determined by which frame was attended. There were a number of constraints that limited the effect. A static anchor near the flashes suppressed the effect but an extended static texture did not. If the probes were continuous rather than flashed, the effect was abolished. The observational reports of 30 online participants suggest that the frame effect is robust to many variations in its shape and path and leads to a perception of flashed tests in their locations relative to the frame as if the frame were stationary. Our results highlight the role of frame continuity and of the grouping of the flashes with the frame in generating the frame effect.",

    "abstract": "SummaryNumerous R packages have been developed for bioinformatics analysis in the last decade and dependencies among packages have become critical issues to consider. In this work, we proposed a new metric named dependency heaviness that measures the number of unique dependencies that a parent brings to a package, and we proposed possible solutions for reducing the complexity of dependencies by optimizing the use of heavy parents. We implemented the metric in a new R package pkgndep which provides an intuitive way for dependency heaviness analysis. Based on pkgndep, we additionally performed a global analysis of dependency heaviness on CRAN and Bioconductor ecosystems and we revealed top packages that have significant contributions of high dependency heaviness to their child packages.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe package pkgndep and documentations are freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgndep. The dependency heaviness analysis for all 21,741 CRAN and Bioconductor packages retrieved on 2021-10-28 are available at https://pkgndep.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential co-factor at the intersection of diverse metabolic pathways. Cellular CoA biosynthesis is regulated at the first committed step-- phosphorylation of pantothenic acid--catalyzed by pantothenate kinases (PANK1,2,3 in humans, PANK3 being the most highly expressed). Despite the critical importance of CoA in metabolism, the differential roles of PANK isoforms remain poorly understood. Our investigations of PANK proteins as precision oncology collateral lethality targets (PANK1 is co-deleted as part of the PTEN locus in some highly aggressive cancers) were severely hindered by a dearth of commercial antibodies that can reliably detect endogenous PANK3. While we successfully validated commercial antibodies for PANK1 and PANK2 using CRISPR knockout cell lines, we found no commercial antibody that could detect endogenous PANK3. We therefore set out to generate a mouse monoclonal antibody against human PANK3 protein. We demonstrate that clone (Clone MDA-299-62A) can reliably detect endogenous PANK3 protein in cancer cell lines, with band-specificity confirmed by CRISPR PANK3 knockout cell lines. Sub-cellular fractionation indicates that PANK3 is overwhelmingly cytosolic and expressed broadly across cancer cell lines. PANK3 monoclonal antibody MDA-299-62A should prove a valuable tool for researchers investigating this understudied family of metabolic enzymes in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "2.RationaleSorbs2 is a cardiomyocyte-enriched, cytoskeletal adaptor protein, and given some evidence for its dysregulated expression in failing hearts, there is growing interest in understanding its roles in cardiac biology and disease. While Sorbs2 global knockout mice display lethal cardiomyopathy with severe arrhythmias, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and whether this results from intrinsic loss of Sorbs2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown, as Sorbs2 is also well-expressed in the nervous system and vasculature. In addition, the potential relevance of Sorbs2 in human cardiomyopathy remains underexplored.\n\nObjectiveTo characterize the effects and potential underlying mechanisms of cardiomyocyte- specific deletion of Sorbs2 on cardiac structure and function in mice, and to further examine Sorbs2 dysregulation in failing hearts and explore potential links between Sorbs2 genetic variations and human cardiovascular disease phenotypes.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe report that myocardial Sorbs2 expression is consistently upregulated in humans with ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathies, and in experimental animal models of heart failure (HF). We generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific loss of Sorbs2 (Sorbs2-cKO) and found early atrial and ventricular conduction abnormalities, despite unaltered expression of primary action potential ion channels and gap junction proteins. At mid-life, Sorbs2-cKO mice exhibit impaired cardiac contractility with cardiomyofibers failing to maintain adequate mechanical tension. As a result, these mice develop progressive diastolic and systolic dysfunction, enlarged cardiac chambers, and die with congestive HF at approximately one year of age. Comprehensive survey of potential underlying mechanisms revealed that Sorbs2-cKO hearts exhibit defective microtubule polymerization and compensatory upregulation of structural proteins desmin, vinculin, and tubulins. Finally, consistent with our observations in mice, we identified suggestive links between Sorbs2 genetic variants and related human cardiac phenotypes, including conduction abnormalities, atrial enlargement, and dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nConclusionsOur studies show that Sorbs2 is essential for maintaining cytoskeletal structural integrity in cardiomyocytes likely through strengthening the interactions between microtubules and other structural proteins at crosslink sites. Overall, this study provides key insights into the critical role for Sorbs2 in cardiomyocytes and likely other cell types in maintaining normal cardiac structure and function and highlights its potential clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in TRPC6 are a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in humans. Many of these mutations are known to have a gain-of-function effect on the non-specific cation channel function of TRPC6. In vitro studies have suggested these mutations affect several signaling pathways, but in vivo studies have largely compared wild-type and Trpc6-deficient rodents. We developed mice carrying a gain-of-function Trpc6 mutation encoding an E896K amino acid change, corresponding to a known FSGS mutation in TRPC6. Homozygous mutant Trpc6 animals have no appreciable renal pathology, and do not develop albuminuria until very advanced age. The Trpc6E896K mutation does not impart susceptibility to PAN nephrosis. The animals show a slight delay in recovery from the albumin overload model. In response to chronic angiotensin II infusion, Trpc6E896K/E896K mice have slightly greater albuminuria initially compared to wild-type animals, an effect that is lost at later time points, and a statistically non-significant trend toward more glomerular injury. This phenotype is nearly opposite to that of Trpc6-deficient animals previously described. The Trpc6 mutation does not appreciably impact renal interstitial fibrosis in response to either angiotensin II infusion, or folate-induced kidney injury. TRPC6 protein and TRPC6-agonist induced calcium influx could not be detected in glomeruli. In sum, these findings suggest that a gain-of-function Trpc6 mutation confers only a mild susceptibility to glomerular injury in the mouse.",

    "abstract": "The photorespiratory pathway consists of enzymes operating in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. Conifer leaves lack one of them, chloroplastic Gln synthetase, which questioned the current belief that the photorespiratory mechanism is identical between angiosperm C3 species and conifers. A photorespiratory-metabolite analysis of the leaves of 13 conifer and 14 angiosperm tree species revealed significant differences in the mean metabolite concentrations between the two taxonomic groups: the glycerate content on chlorophyll basis in conifer leaves was <1/10 that detected in angiosperm leaves, whereas the glycolate content was 1.6 times higher in conifer leaves. Glycerate is produced from Ser through an intermediate, hydroxypyruvate. To investigate the lower glycerate levels observed in conifer leaves, we performed experiments of 13C-labeled Ser feeding to the detached shoots of a conifer (Cryptomeria japonica) via the transpiration stream, and compared the labeling patterns of photorespiratory metabolites with those of an angiosperm (Populus nigra). Glycerate was most labeled in P. nigra, whereas glycolate was more labeled than glycerate in C. japonica. The photorespiration pathway involves H2O2-scavenging and H2O2-generating enzymes, catalase (CAT) and glycolate oxidase (GLO), respectively, which are the peroxisomal targeting enzymes in angiosperms. In contrast, database analyses of the peroxisomal targeting signal motifs and analyses of the peroxisomal fractions isolated from C. japonica leaves indicated that the conifer peroxisomes were not a major localization of CAT. These results suggest that the conifer photorespiration pathway has a bypass from Ser to glycolate via the decarboxylation of hydroxypyruvate, because of an imbalance between CAT and GLO activities in peroxisomes.\n\nOne sentence summaryConifer peroxisome is not a major localization of catalase and yields a unique oxidative decarboxylation path in the photorespiratory pathway.",

Numerous methods of measuring Fvert and body size exist, but few studies have compared how these methods affect the conclusions of scaling analyses. We compared two common techniques for measuring Fvert in bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) and mason bees (Osmia lignaria), and examined Fvert scaling using five size metrics. Fvert results were similar with incremental or asymptotic load-lifting, but scaling analyses were sensitive to the size metric used. Analyses based on some size metrics indicated similar scaling exponents and coefficients between species, whereas other metrics indicated different coefficients. Furthermore, Fvert showed isometry with body lengths and fed and starved masses, but negative allometry with dry mass. We conclude that Fvert can be measured using either incremental or asymptotic loading but choosing a size metric for scaling studies requires careful consideration.",

It was concluded that abiotic and biotic factors together help in explaining why various pest species build their communities rapidly and increase their parameters that become above the EIL. Such factors are hypothesized to affect the plant-arthropod, predator-herbivore, predator-predator, and tri-trophic interactions.

    "abstract": "GABAA receptors (GABAARs) mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission throughout the brain. Although it is widely known that pore-forming subunits critically determine receptor function, it is unclear whether their single-channel properties are modulated by GABAAR-associated transmembrane proteins. We previously identified Shisa7 as a GABAAR auxiliary subunit that modulates the trafficking, pharmacology, and kinetic properties of these receptors. In particular, Shisa7 accelerates receptor deactivation; however, the underlying mechanisms by which Shisa7 controls GABAAR kinetics have yet to be determined. Here we have performed single-channel recordings and find that while Shisa7 does not change channel slope conductance, it reduces the frequency of openings. Importantly, Shisa7 modulates GABAAR gating by decreasing the duration and open probability (Po) within bursts. Kinetic analysis of dwell times, activation modeling, and macroscopic simulations indicate that Shisa7 accelerates GABAAR deactivation by governing the time spent between close and open states during gating. Together, our data provide a mechanistic basis for how Shisa7 controls GABAAR gating kinetics and reveal for the first time that GABAAR single-channel properties can be modulated by an auxiliary subunit. These findings shed light on processes that shape the temporal dynamics of GABAergic transmission.",

Huntingtons disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with mutant Huntingtin-induced abnormalities in neuronal mitochondrial dynamics and quality control. Former studies suggest that the removal of defective mitochondria may be compromised in HD. The mitochondrial quality control is a complex, well-orchestrated pathway that can be compromised through mitophagy dysregulation or impairment in the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis. Another mitochondrial stress response is the generation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles that fuse with the endolysosomal system and form multivesicular bodies that are extruded from cells as extracellular vesicles (EVs).\n\nIn this study, we comprehensively characterized the mitochondrial and autophagy alterations in premanifest and manifest HD patients and performed a proteomic and genomic EVs profile. We observed that manifest HD patients exhibit mitochondrial and autophagy impairment associated with enhanced EVs release. Further, we detected mitochondrial components in EVs released by HD cells and in neuron-derived EVs. The EV-associated mtDNA copies were elevated in manifest HD patients suggesting to be an alternative pathway for secretion of reactive mitochondrial components. This study provides a novel framework connecting EVs enhanced release of mitochondrial components to mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in HD.",

Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have found diversity of microglia both across different stages and within the same stage in the developing brain. However, how such diversity is controlled during development is poorly understood. In this study, we first found the expression of the macrophage mannose receptor CD206 in early-stage embryonic microglia on mouse brain sections. This expression showed a sharp decline between E12.5 and E13.5 across the central nervous system. We next tested the roles of the microglia-expressed zinc finger transcription factor SALL1 in this early transition of gene expression. By deleting Sall1 specifically in microglia, we found that many microglia continued to express CD206 when it is normally downregulated. In addition, the mutant microglia continued to show less ramified morphology in comparison with controls even into postnatal stages. Thus, SALL1 is required for early microglia to transition into a more mature status during development.",

The amplitude and duration of sodium currents are tuned by intracellular fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs/iFGFs) that associate with the cytoplasmic tails of voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs), and genetic ablation of Fhf genes disturbs neurological and cardiac functions. Among reported phenotypes, Fhf2null mice undergo lethal hyperthermia-induced cardiac conduction block attributable to the combined effects of FHF2 deficiency and elevated temperature on the cardiac sodium channel (Nav1.5) inactivation rate. Fhf2null mice also display a lack of heat nociception, while retaining other somatosensory capabilities. Here, we use electrophysiological and computational methods to show that the heat nociception deficit can be explained by the combined effects of elevated temperature and FHF2 deficiency on the fast inactivation gating of Nav1.7 and tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels expressed in dorsal root ganglion C fibers. Hence, neurological and cardiac heat-associated deficits in Fhf2null mice derive from shared impacts of FHF deficiency and temperature towards Nav inactivation gating kinetics in distinct tissues.",

Here we generated cerebral organoid models derived from pluripotent stem cells to investigate the HSV-induced pathogenesis associated with AD and the role of antiviral drugs in the phenotypic rescue. Our results identified that the HSV-1-infected cerebral organoids recapitulated multiscale neuropathology pertaining to the onset and progression of AD across the genetic, cellular, and tissue levels, including the multicellular A{beta} deposition, dysregulated endogenous AD mediators, reactive gliosis, neuroinflammation, and neural loss. Furthermore, we identified that two antiviral drugs, namely Ribavirin (RBV) and Valacyclovir (VCV), inhibited HSV-1 replication and rescued the neuropathological phenotypes associated with AD in the HSV-1-infected cerebral organoids, implying their therapeutic potential to slow down the progression of AD. Our study provides a high-fidelity human-relevant in-vitro HSV-1 infection model to reconstitute the multiscale neuropathological features associated with AD and discover therapeutic drug candidates relevant to the AD viral hypothesis.\n\nIMPORTANCEAD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal death, brain atrophy, and cognitive impairment. HSV-1 is a neurotropic double-stranded DNA virus resulting in long-term neurological sequelae in adults.\n\nThere is accumulating evidence indicating that AD may be associated with HSV-1 infections. In this study, we generated human-physiologically related cerebral organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to investigate the influence of HSV-1 infection on the neuropathology associated with AD. We found that the HSV-1-infected cerebral organoids could model typical neuropathological features associated with AD. Additionally, we discovered that both RBV and VCV significantly rescued the HSV-1-induced pathological phenotypes associated with AD. These findings may open new avenues of consideration related to HSV-1 infection and AD. Furthermore, the contribution of these antiviral drugs to AD linked to HSV-1 infection will provide new clues to potential new therapies.",

    "abstract": "Studies in Social Neuroeconomics have consistently reported activation in social cognition regions during interactive economic games suggesting mentalizing during economic choice. It remains important to test the involvement of neural activity associated with mentalizing in an economic games context within the same sample of participants performing the same task. We designed a novel version of the classic false-belief task in which participants observed interactions between agents in the ultimatum and trust games and were subsequently asked to infer the agents beliefs. We compared activation patterns during the economic-games false-belief task to those during the classic false-belief task using conjunction analyses. We find significant overlap in left TPJ, and dmPFC, as well as temporal pole during two task phases: belief formation and belief inference. Moreover, gPPI analyses show that during belief formation right TPJ is a target of both left TPJ and right temporal pole (TP) seed regions, while during belief inferences all seed regions show interconnectivity with each other. These results indicate that across different task types and phases, mentalizing is associated with activation and connectivity across central nodes of the social cognition network. Importantly, this is the case in the context of the novel economic-games and classic false-belief tasks.",

    "abstract": "During the early postnatal period, cerebral white matter undergoes rapid maturation through a complex series of interrelated cellular and histogenetic processes. Accurately quantifying these processes is important for improving understanding of early brain development, developmental abnormalities related to prematurity, and neurodevelopmental diseases. Past efforts have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track these developmental processes in vivo. However, most previous studies have relied on single imaging modality data and have often been limited by small samples and analytics that do not evaluate complex multivariate imaging patterns. Here, we applied an advanced unsupervised multivariate pattern analysis technique, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), to T2w/T1w signal ratio maps from a large cohort of newborns (Developing Human Connectome Project [dHCP], n=342), revealing patterns of synchronous white matter maturation. These patterns showed divergent age-related maturational trajectories and differential susceptibility to premature birth, which were replicated in an independent large sample of newborns (Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders [eLABE], n=239). Furthermore, we showed that T2w/T1w signal variations in white matter maturational patterns are explained by differential contributions of white matter microstructure indices (i.e., free water content and neurite density index) derived from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) modeling of diffusion-weighted MRI. Finally, we demonstrated how white matter maturation patterns relate to distinct histological features by comparing our findings with postmortem late fetal/early postnatal brain tissue staining. Together, these results delineate a novel MRI representation of white matter microstructural and histological reorganization during the early postnatal development.",

    "abstract": "Despite the existence of well-characterized, canonical mutations that confer high-level drug resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), there is evidence that drug resistance mechanisms are more complex than simple acquisition of such mutations. Recent studies have shown that Mtb can acquire non-canonical resistance-associated mutations that confer survival advantages in the presence of certain drugs, likely acting as stepping-stones for acquisition of high-level resistance. Rv2752c/rnj, encoding RNase J, is disproportionately mutated in drug-resistant clinical Mtb isolates. Here we show that deletion of rnj confers increased tolerance to lethal concentrations of several drugs. RNAseq revealed that RNase J affects expression of a subset of genes enriched for PE/PPE genes and stable RNAs and is key for proper 23S rRNA maturation. Gene expression differences implicated two sRNAs and ppe50-ppe51 as important contributors to the drug tolerance phenotype. In addition, we found that in the absence of RNase J, many short RNA fragments accumulate because they are degraded at slower rates. We show that the accumulated transcript fragments are targets of RNase J and are characterized by strong secondary structure and high G+C content, indicating that RNase J has a rate-limiting role in degradation of highly structured RNAs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RNase J indirectly affects drug tolerance, as well as reveal the endogenous roles of RNase J in mycobacterial RNA metabolism.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlterations of the gut microbiome have been linked to multiple chronic diseases. However, the drivers of such changes remain largely unknown. The oral cavity acts as a major route of exposure to exogenous factors including pathogens, and processes therein may affect the communities in the subsequent compartments of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we perform strain-resolved, integrated multi-omic analyses of saliva and stool samples collected from eight families with multiple cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).\n\nResultsWe identified distinct oral microbiota mostly reflecting competition between streptococcal species. More specifically, we found a decreased abundance of the commensal Streptococcus salivarius in the oral cavity of T1DM individuals, which is linked to its apparent competition with the pathobiont Streptococcus mutans. The decrease in S. salivarius in the oral cavity was also associated with its decrease in the gut as well as higher abundances in facultative anaerobes including Enterobacteria. In addition, we found evidence of gut inflammation in T1DM as reflected in the expression profiles of the Enterobacteria as well as in the human gut proteome. Finally, we were able to follow transmitted strain-variants from the oral cavity to the gut at the metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic levels, highlighting not only the transfer, but also the activity of the transmitted taxa along the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nConclusionsAlterations of the oral microbiome in the context of T1DM impact the microbial communities in the lower gut, in particular through the reduction of \"oral-to-gut\" transfer of Streptococcus salivarius. Our results indicate that the observed oral-cavity-driven gut microbiome changes may contribute towards the inflammatory processes involved in T1DM. Through the integration of multi-omic analyses, we resolve strain-variant \"mouth-to-gut\" transfer in a disease context.",

    "abstract": "Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy has saved numerous lives of cancer patients; however, it only exerts efficacy in 10-15% of patients with colorectal cancer. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a potential approach to improving the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, whereas the detailed mechanisms and the applicability of this combination therapy remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the synergistic effect of FMT with anti-PD-1 in curing colorectal tumor-bearing mice using a multi-omics approach. Mice treated with the combination therapy showed superior survival rate and tumor control, compared to the mice received anti-PD-1 therapy or FMT alone. Metagenomic analysis showed that composition of gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-1 therapy was remarkably altered through receiving FMT. Particularly, Bacteroides genus, including FMT-increased B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, and FMT-decreased B. ovatus might contribute to the enhanced efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis upon mouse plasma revealed several potential metabolites that upregulated after FMT, including punicic acid and aspirin, might promote the response to anti-PD-1 therapy via their immunomodulatory functions. This work broadens our understanding of the mechanism by which FMT improves the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, which may contribute to the development of novel microbiota-based anti-cancer therapies.",

Trichodesmium blooms typically comprise a complex assemblage of subpopulations and colony-morphologies that are predicted to exhibit distinct ecological lifestyles. Here, we assessed the poorly studied diversity of Trichodesmium in the Red Sea, based on metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and hetR gene-based phylotyping.\n\nWe assembled four non-redundant MAGs from morphologically distinct Trichodesmium colonies (tufts, dense and thin puffs). T. thiebautii (puffs) and T. erythraeum (tufts) were the dominant species within these morphotypes. While subspecies diversity is present for both T. thiebautii and T. erythraeum, a single T. thiebautii genotype comprised both thin and dense puff morphotypes, and we therefore hypothesize that the phenotypic variation between these morphologies is likely attributed to gene regulation. Additionally, we found the rare non-diazotrophic clade IV and V genotypes, related to T. nobis and T. miru respectively, that likely occurred as single filaments. HetR gene phylogeny indicates that the genotype in clade IV could represent the species T. contortum.\n\nWe further show that hetR phylotyping can overestimate the taxonomic diversity of Trichodesmium, as two copies of the hetR gene were present within T. thiebautii genomes, one of which misidentified this lineage as T. aureum. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of re-assessing Trichodesmium taxonomy while showing the ability of genomics to capture the complex diversity and distribution of Trichodesmium populations.",

    "abstract": "This short paper on yellow head virus Type1 (YHV-1) describes preliminary research worthy of further study. YHV-1 disease outbreaks can cause severe mortality in the cultivated shrimp Penaeus (Penaeus) monodon and Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei. No practical preventative treatment such as vaccination has been reported. However, it has been shown that C6/36 mosquito cell cultures can adapt to YHV-1 and become persistently immunopositive for the virus after 30 split-cell passages or more. Shrimp injection with homogenates from low passages caused yellow head disease (YHD) but from high passages did not, even though injection resulted in immunopositive hemocytes in the injected shrimp. This suggested YHV-1 attenuation during insect cell passaging and the possibility of using cell homogenates as a vaccine to protect shrimp against virulent YHV-1. To test this hypothesis, we injected shrimp with 30th passage homogenates to test for protection against YHD upon subsequent challenge with virulent YHV-1. Results confirmed earlier work that hemocytes of the infected shrimp became both reverse transcriptase PCR positive and immunopositive for YHV-1 but exhibited no mortality. Similarly, there was no mortality in the control group injected with homogenate from YHV-1 negative insect cells. When subsequently challenged with YHV-1, shrimp in the positive control group injected with homogenate from naive insect cells gave 100 percent mortality within 7 days post challenge while total mortality in the group injected with YHV-1 homogenate did not occur until day 9 post challenge. Kaplan-Meier log-rank survival analysis revealed that survival curves for the two groups were significantly different (p<0.001) and that the mean survival time for the test group (6.5 days) was significantly longer than that in the positive control group (5.4 days). The results confirmed that shrimp injection with YHV-1 immunopositive insect-cell homogenate gave transient resistance to YHV infection and that further research into the possible use of insect cell lines to produce shrimp antiviral vaccines is warranted.",

However, it remains unclear why FIT and bHLH Ib depend on each other to regulate the Fe deficiency response. By analyzing Fe deficiency phenotypes and Fe uptake genes, we found that the quadruple bhlh4x mutants (bhlh38 bhlh39 bhlh100 bhlh101) mimic the fit mutant. Subcellular localization analyses indicate that bHLH38 and bHLH39 are preferentially expressed in the cytoplasm whereas bHLH100 and bHLH101 in the nucleus. Transcriptome data show that the genes involved in Fe signaling pathway show the same expression trends in bhlh4x and fit. Genetic analyses suggest that FIT and bHLH Ib depend each other to regulate the Fe deficiency response. Further biochemical assays indicate that bHLH Ib TFs possess the DNA binding ability and FIT has the transcription activation ability. This work concludes that FIT and bHLH Ib form a functional transcription complex in which bHLH Ib is responsible for target recognition and FIT for transcription activation, explaining why FIT and bHLH Ib interdependently regulate Fe uptake.",

    "abstract": "The urban mosquito species Aedes aegypti is the main vector of arboviruses worldwide. Mosquito control with insecticides is the most prevalent method for preventing transmission in the absence of effective vaccines and available treatments; however, the extensive use of insecticides has led to the development of resistance in mosquito populations throughout the world, and the number of epidemics caused by arboviruses has increased.\n\nThree mosquito lines with different resistance profiles to deltamethrin were isolated in French Guiana, including one with the I1016 knock-down resistant allele. Significant differences were observed in the cumulative proportion of mosquitoes with a disseminated chikungunya virus infection over time. In addition, certain genes (CYP6BB2, CYP6N12, GST2, trypsin) were variably overexpressed in the midgut at 7 days after an infectious blood meal in these three lines. Therefore, detoxification enzymes and kdr mutations may contribute to an enhanced midgut barrier and reduced dissemination rate.\n\nOur work shows that vector competence for chikungunya virus varied between Ae. aegypti laboratory lines with different deltamethrin-resistance profiles. More accurate verification of the functional association between insecticide resistance and vector competence remains to be demonstrated.\n\nImportanceThree Ae. aegypti lines, isolated from the same collection site, underwent different insecticide selection pressures against deltamethrin under laboratory conditions. As a result, they developed different resistant profiles. In this study, when these lines were fed an artificial infectious blood meal containing chikungunya virus, all three lines including the reference strain showed a high infection rate. There was no statistical difference in infection rate found; however, the dissemination rate of the virus from midgut to head were significantly different. A higher resistance level detected by the WHO test was correlated with a lower viral dissemination rate for each strain. This study presented evidence that the insecticide selection pressure or the existence of insecticide resistance could lead to differences in viral dissemination or even transmission in mosquito populations. We hope that our study can give more insights into understanding the roles of mosquito insecticide resistance on viral transmission.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the frequency of shifts to new host plants within diverse clades of specialist herbivorous insects is critically important to understand whether and how host shifts contribute to the origin of species. Oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Cynipini) comprise a tribe of ~1000 species of phytophagous insects that induce gall formation on various organs of trees in the family Fagacae, -- primarily the oaks (genus Quercus; ~435 sp). The association of oak gall wasps with oaks is ancient (~50 my), and most oak species are galled by one or more gall wasp species. Despite the diversity of both gall wasp species and their plant associations, previous phylogenetic work has not identified a strong signal of host plant shifting among oak gall wasps. However, most emphasis has been on the Western Palearctic and not the Nearctic where both oaks and oak gall wasps are considerably more species rich and where oaks are more phylogenetically diverse. We collected 86 species of Nearctic oak gall wasps from 10 of the 14 major clades of Nearctic oaks and sequenced >1000 Ultra Conserved Elements (UCEs) and flanking sequences to infer wasp phylogenies. We assessed the relationships of Nearctic gall wasps to one another and, by leveraging previously published UCE data, to the Palearctic fauna. We then used phylogenies to infer historical patterns of shifts among host tree species and tree organs. Our results indicate that oak gall wasps have moved between the Palearctic and Nearctic at least four times, that some Palearctic clades have their proximate origin in the Nearctic, and that gall wasps have shifted within and between oak tree sections, subsections, and organs considerably more often than the analysis of previous data have suggested. Given that host shifts have been demonstrated to drive reproductive isolation between host-associated populations in other phytophagous insects, our analyses of Nearctic gall wasps suggest that host shifts are key drivers of speciation in this clade, especially in hotspots of oak diversity. Though formal assessment of this hypothesis requires further study, two putatively oligophagous gall wasp species in our dataset show signals of host-associated genetic differentiation unconfounded by geographic distance, suggestive of barriers to gene flow associated with the use of alternative host plants.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 is a rapidly evolving virus able to evade host immunity through rapid adaptation during chronic infection. The HIV-1 group M has diversified since its zoonosis into several subtypes at a rate of the order of 10-3 changes per site per year. This rate varies between different parts of the genome and its inference is sensitive to the time scale and diversity spanned by the sequence data used. Higher rates are estimated on short time scales and particularly for within-host evolution, while rate estimates spanning decades or the entire HIV-1 pandemic tend to be lower. The underlying causes of this difference are not well understood.\n\nWe investigate here the role of rapid reversions toward a preferred evolutionary sequence state on multiple time scales. We show that within-host reversion mutations are under positive selection and contribute substantially to sequence turnover, especially at conserved sites. We then use the rates of reversions and non-reversions estimated from longitudinal within-host data to parametrize a phylogenetic sequence evolution model. Sequence simulation of this model on HIV-1 phylogenies reproduces diversity and apparent evolutionary rates of HIV-1 in gag and pol, suggesting that a tendency to rapidly revert to a consensus-like state can explain much of the time dependence of evolutionary rate estimates in HIV-1.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary populations are unlikely to respond to natural selection if much of their genetic variance is non-additive. Understanding the evolutionary and genomic factors that drive amounts of non-additive variance in natural populations is therefore of paramount importance. Here, we use a quantitative genetic breeding design to delineate the additive and non-additive components of expression variance of 17,656 gene transcripts segregating in the outcrossing plant Arabidopsis lyrata. We find that most of the genetic variance in gene expression represents non-additive variance, especially among long genes or genes involved in epigenetic gene regulation. Genes with the most non-additive variation not only display a markedly lower rate of synonymous variation, they have also been exposed to stronger purifying selection than genes with high additive variance. This study demonstrates that the potential of standing variation for future evolution is shaped the history of purifying selection.",

    "abstract": "Haspin is a histone kinase that promotes error-free chromosome segregation by recruiting the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) to mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. Haspin remains less well studied than other M-phase kinases and the models explaining Haspin function have been developed primarily in mitotic cells. Here, we generate new mutations in the C. elegans Haspin homologs hasp-1 and hasp-2 and characterize their phenotypes. We show that hasp-1 is responsible for all predicted functions of Haspin and that loss of function of hasp-1 using classical and conditional alleles produces defects in germline stem cell proliferation, spermatogenesis, and confirms its role in oocyte meiosis. Genetic analysis suggests hasp-1 acts downstream of the Polo-like kinase plk-2 and shows synthetic interactions between hasp-1 and two genes expected to promote recruitment of the CPC by a parallel pathway that depends on the kinase Bub1. This work adds to the growing understanding of Haspin function by characterizing a variety of roles in an intact animal.\n\nSummary statementWe characterize new mutations in the C. elegans homologs of the histone kinase Haspin and show roles in spermatogenesis, germline proliferation and genetic interactions during oocyte meiosis.",

This paper presents a novel binning method that addresses these concerns. Firstly, taken from natural language processing literature, a sequence representation model - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) - is utilized to generate semantic and positional contig embeddings. Secondly, two workflows are presented; one which applies a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm to find metagenomic bins and the other which incorporates contig embedding into a state-of-the-art binner. Experimental results on a publicly available metagenomic dataset show superior clustering for shorter contigs compared to traditionally used tetranucleotide frequency (TNF), reconstruction of up to 17% more high-precision genomes, and improved semantic understanding of contigs.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR screening coupled with single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to characterize the effects of genetic perturbations on the whole transcriptome at a single-cell level. However, due to the sparsity and complex structure of data, analysis of single-cell CRISPR screening data remains challenging. In particular, standard differential expression analysis methods are often under-powered to detect genes affected by CRISPR perturbations. We developed a novel method for such data, called Guided Sparse Factor Analysis (GSFA). GSFA infers latent factors that represent co-regulated genes or gene modules, and by borrowing information from these factors, infers the effects of genetic perturbations on individual genes. We demonstrated through extensive simulation studies that GSFA detects perturbation effects with much higher power than state-of-the-art methods. Using single-cell CRISPR data from human CD8+ T cells and neural progenitor cells, we showed that GSFA identified biologically relevant gene modules and specific genes affected by CRISPR perturbations, many of which were missed by existing methods, providing new insights into the functions of genes involved in T cell activation and neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once the most economically and ecologically important hardwood species in the United States. In the first half of the 20th century, an exotic fungal pathogen - Cryphonectria parasitica - decimated the species, killing approximately four billion trees. Two approaches to developing blight resistant American chestnut populations show promise, but both will require introduction of adaptive genomic diversity from wild germplasm to produce diverse, locally adapted reforestation populations. Here we characterize population structure, demographic history, and genomic diversity in a range-wide sample of 384 wild American chestnuts to inform conservation and breeding with blight resistant varieties. Population structure analyses with DAPC and ADMIXTURE suggest that the chestnut range can be roughly divided into northeast, central, and southwest populations. Within-population genomic diversity estimates revealed a clinal pattern with the highest diversity in the southwest, which likely reflects bottleneck events associated with Quaternary glaciation. Finally, we identified genomic regions under positive selection within each population, which suggests that defense against fungal pathogens is a common target of selection across all populations. Taken together, these results show that American chestnut underwent a postglacial expansion from the southern portion of its range leading to three extant populations. These populations will serve as management units for breeding adaptive genetic variation into the blight-resistant tree populations for targeted reintroduction efforts.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria and lytic viruses (phages) engage in highly dynamic coevolutionary interactions over time, yet we have little idea of how transient selection by phages might shape the future evolutionary trajectories of their host populations. To explore this question, we generated genetically diverse phage-resistant mutants of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We subjected the panel of mutants to prolonged experimental evolution in the absence of phages. Some populations re-evolved phage sensitivity, while others acquired compensatory mutations that reduced the costs of resistance without altering resistance levels. To ask whether these outcomes were driven by the initial genetic mechanisms of resistance, we next evolved independent replicates of each mutant lineage in the absence of phages. We found a strong signature of historical contingency: some mutations were highly reversible across replicate populations, while others were highly entrenched. Through whole-genome sequencing of bacteria over time, we also found that populations with resistance mutations in the same gene acquired more parallel sets of mutations than populations with resistance mutations in different genes, suggesting that compensatory adaptation is also contingent on how resistance initially evolved. Our study identifies an evolutionary ratchet in bacteria-phage coevolution, and may explain previous observations that resistance persists over time in some bacterial populations but is lost in others. We add to a growing body of work describing the key role of phages in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of their host communities. Beyond this specific trait, our study provides new insight into the genetic architecture of historical contingency, a crucial component of interpreting and predicting evolution.",
