    "abstract": "The intestines of wild Caenorhabditis nematodes are inhabited by a variety of microorganisms, including gut microbiome bacteria and pathogens, such as microsporidia and viruses. Because of the similarities between Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian intestinal cells, as well as the power of the C. elegans system, this host has emerged as a model system to study host intestine-microbe interactions in vivo. While it is possible to observe some aspects of these interactions with bright-field microscopy, it is difficult to accurately classify microbes and characterize the extent of colonization or infection without more precise tools.\n\nThis protocol introduces RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a tool used for the identification, visualization, and quantification of the microbes within the intestines of C. elegans. FISH probes that label the highly abundant small subunit ribosomal RNA can produce a bright signal for bacteria and microsporidian cells, and similar probes can be used to label viral RNA. FISH probes can be ordered from a commercial source as single-stranded DNA end-labeled with fluorophores. One limitation is that FISH may not provide robust signal against low copy targets, although signal can be boosted by using multiple probes (so-called  single-molecule FISH). FISH staining involves collecting colonized or infected animals, washing to eliminate external contamination, followed by fixation in either paraformaldehyde or acetone. After fixation, FISH probes are incubated with samples to allow for the hybridization of probes to the desired target. To remove excess background, the animals are washed again, and then examined on microscope slides or using automated approaches.\n\nOverall, this protocol enables detection, identification, and quantification of the microbes that inhabit the C. elegans intestine, including microbes for which there are no genetic tools available.\n\nSUMMARYGut microbiome bacteria and intestinal intracellular pathogens, like the Orsay virus and microsporidia, are often found associated with wild Caenorhabditis nematodes. This protocol presents RNA FISH as a method for the detection, quantification, and identification of colonizing or infectious microbes within the context of intact C. elegans nematodes.",

    "abstract": "Plasmepsin V (PM V) is a pepsin-like aspartic protease essential for growth of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Previous work has shown PM V to be an ER-resident protease that processes parasite proteins destined for export into the host cell. Depletion or inhibition of the enzyme is lethal during asexual replication within red blood cells, as well as during the formation of sexual stage gametocytes. The structure of the P. vivax PM V has been characterized by x-ray crystallography, revealing a canonical pepsin fold punctuated by structural features uncommon to secretory aspartic proteases. Here we use parasite genetics to probe these structural features by attempting to rescue lethal PM V depletion with various mutant enzymes. We find an unusual nepenthesin 1-type insert to be essential for parasite growth and PM V activity. Mutagenesis of the nepenthesin insert suggests that both its amino acid sequence and one of the two disulfide bonds that undergird its structure are required for the nepenthesin inserts role in PM V function. Molecular dynamics simulations paired with Markov state modelling suggest that the nepenthesin insert allosterically controls PM V catalysis through multiple mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCystic fibrosis (CF) patients have reduced mucociliary clearance resulting in recurring and chronic bacterial lung infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common pathogens to colonize the airways of CF patients and can persist in the lungs for decades. CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa are treated with macrolides to inhibit quorum sensing, mucoidity and has additional immunomodulatory effects. However, according to the EUCAST committee, P. aeruginosa is not susceptible to macrolides leaving resistance mechanisms largely overlooked.\n\nMethodsUsing a modified susceptibility testing protocol, P. aeruginosa isolates harbouring a mutated uL4 ribosomal protein were tested for resistance against macrolide antibiotics. Quorum sensing related properties, alterations in proteome composition and ribosome subunits distribution were further analysed to characterize the effect of the uL4 mutations on the physiology of the bacteria.\n\nFindingsSeveral uL4 mutations were identified in isolates from P. aeruginosa collections from various sources and geographical locations. Most of them mapped to the conserved loop region of uL4 and resulted in increased survival upon macrolide exposure. uL4 mutations did not negatively impact the physiology of the bacteria and greater concentrations of antibiotic were needed to inhibit the growth, reduce swimming motility, and induce redox sensitivity. Proteome analysis revealed that pathways involved in ribosome adaptation displayed altered expression levels possibly to compensate for the uL4 mutations, which changed the subunit distribution of the ribosome.\n\nInterpretationMacrolides used against P. aeruginosa cause selection of macrolide resistant mutants which is a widespread - but uncharacterized - phenomenon. Using a modified susceptibility test, revealed that macrolides are indeed effective bacteriostatic antibiotics against P. aeruginosa and that this effect - along with macrolide-induced quorum sensing modulation - are drastically reduced in uL4 mutants. Macrolide antibiotics should, therefore, be considered as active antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa and resistance development should be contemplated especially when patients are treated with prolonged courses of macrolides.\n\nFundingCystic Fibrosis Foundation, Independent Research Fund Denmark, Novo Nordisk Foundation\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMacrolide antibiotics are readily prescribed as anti-inflammatory therapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients. This treatment strategy has largely overlooked the direct antimicrobial effect of this drug class on this pathogen, which is considered non-susceptible according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. This is because standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing is sub-optimal for the quantification of macrolide minimum inhibitory concentrations due to the interference of the growth medium. Mutations in ribosomal RNA and increased efflux has been shown to reduce the effect of macrolides on P. aeruginosa, however, the involvement of ribosomal proteins has not been investigated in P. aeruginosa. Work done in other bacterial species such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Neisseria gonorrhoeae has identified the ribosomal proteins uL4 and uL22 as targets for evolved macrolide resistance in vitro and in vivo. Especially the extended loop region of uL4 has been identified as important for macrolide susceptibility. We found no other studies published addressing the emergence of macrolide resistance through uL4 or uL22 mutations in P. aeruginosa.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe present evidence that macrolide antibiotics used as anti-inflammatory agents and bacterial modulators against P. aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients cause the emergence of resistant strains through mutations in the ribosomal protein uL4. The importance of this finding is underlined by the identification of uL4 mutations in multiple strains not only within our strain collection comprised of CF associated isolates but throughout all available sequences of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates spanning several continents and different infection types. uL4 mutations resulted in significantly reduced susceptibility towards macrolide antibiotics with respect to bacteriostatic and quorum sensing modulation effects. The generation time in presence of macrolide antibiotics was unaffected in strains harbouring uL4 mutations, while it was reduced in wild type strains indicating a fitness advantage of the mutation.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe uL4 mutants identified in this study were significantly more resistant towards macrolide antibiotics than strains harbouring a wild type uL4 hereby revealing that not only are macrolides effective as antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa but also that the imposed selective pressure causes resistant mutants to arise through mutations in the ribosomal uL4 protein. These mutations are also present but uncharacterized in other collections of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from patient groups who typically receive long courses of macrolide treatment. The effect of the uL4 and possibly other hitherto unknown mutations on macrolide susceptibility can be determined via modification of the standard susceptibility testing protocol. Along with evidence describing other types of macrolide resistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa such as rRNA modification and increased efflux activity, our results demonstrate that macrolide resistance development is widespread in P. aeruginosa and macrolide antibiotics should be considered as antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa with the same precautions being taken to avoid resistance development as for any other antimicrobial agent.",

    "abstract": "In nature, many bacteria grow on surfaces, where they form cell collectives that compete for space. Within these collectives, cells often secrete molecules that benefit surface spreading by, for example, reducing surface tension or promoting filamentous growth. Although we have a detailed understanding of how these molecules are produced, much remains unknown about their role in surface competition. Here, we examine sliding motility in Bacillus subtilis and compare how secreted molecules, essential for sliding, affect cooperation and competition on the surface. We specifically examine (i) the lipopeptide surfactin, (ii) the hydrophobin protein BslA and (iii) exopolysaccharides (EPS). We find that these molecules have a remarkably different effect on competition: whereas surfactin acts like a common good, which is costly to produce and benefits cells throughout the surface, BslA and EPS are cost-free and act locally. Accordingly, surfactin deficient mutants can exploit the wild-type strain in competition for space, while BslA and EPS mutants cannot. Using a mathematical model, we show that three factors are important in predicting the outcome of surface competition: the costs of molecule synthesis, the private benefits of molecule production, and the diffusion rate. Our results underscore the intricate extracellular biology that can drive bacterial surface competition.",

    "abstract": "Listeriosis is a dangerous food-borne bacterial disease caused by the Gram-positive Bacillota (Firmicute) bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. In this report, we show that the synthetic lincosamide iboxamycin is highly active against L. monocytogenes and can overcome the intrinsic lincosamide resistance mediated by VgaL/Lmo0919, a member of ABCF ATPase resistance determinants that act by directly removing the antibiotic from the ribosome. While iboxamycin is not bactericidal against L. monocytogenes, it displays a pronounced postantibiotic effect, which is a valuable pharmacokinetic feature. Experiments in L. monocytogenes infection models are necessary to further assess the potential of iboxamycin as a novel drug for treatment of listeriosis. We demonstrate that VmlR ARE ABCF of Bacillota bacterium Bacillus subtilis grants significant (33-fold increase in MIC) protection from iboxamycin, while LsaA ABCF of Enterococcus faecalis grants an 8-fold protective effect. Furthermore, the VmlR-mediated iboxamycin resistance is cooperative with that mediated by the Cfr 23S rRNA methyltransferase resistance determinant, resulting in up to a 512-fold increase in MIC. Therefore, emergence and spread of ABCF ARE variants capable of defeating next-generation lincosamides in the clinic is possible and should be closely monitored.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genome diversity is largely due to prophages, which are viral genomes integrated into the genomes of bacteria. Most prophage genes are silent, but those that are expressed can provide unexpected properties to their host. Using as a model E. coli K-12, that carries 9 defective prophages in its genome, we aimed at highlighting the impact of viral genes on host physiology. We focused our work on AppY, a transcriptional regulator encoded on the DLP12 prophage. By performing RNA-Seq experiments, we showed that AppY production modulates the expression of more than 200 genes; among them, 13 were identified by ChIP-Seq as direct AppY targets. AppY directly and positively regulates several genes involved in the acid stress response including the master regulator gene gadE, but also nhaR and gadY, two genes involved in biofilm formation. Moreover, AppY indirectly and negatively impacts bacterial motility by favouring the degradation of FlhDC, the master regulator of the flagella biosynthesis. As a consequence of these regulatory effects, AppY increased acid stress resistance and biofilm formation while also causing a strong defect in motility. We therefore demonstrate here that AppY is a central regulator from phage origin that controls the expression of bacterial master regulators to provide benefits to E. coli under stress conditions. Our research shed light on the importance to consider the genetic dialogue occurring between prophages and bacteria to fully understand bacterial physiology.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of West Nile virus and Usutu virus in Europe poses a significant risk to public health. In the absence of efficient antiviral therapy or vaccine candidates, the only strategy to control these arboviruses is to target the Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquito vector. However, the selection pressure caused by exposure to insecticides for vector control or agricultural pest control can lead to insecticide resistance, thereby reducing the efficacy of insecticide-based vector control interventions. In Culex mosquitoes, two of the most common amino acid substitutions associated with insecticide resistance are the kdr L1014F in voltage gated sodium channels and G119S in acetylcholinesterase.\n\nIn this study, Culex pipiens biotype pipiens, Culex torrentium, and Culex modestus were sampled from 2019 to 2021 in three distinct environmental habitats (urban, peri-urban, and agricultural) in and around the city of Leuven, Belgium. Individual mosquitoes were screened for two mutations resulting in L1014F and G119S amino acid substitutions. Both mutations were observed in Culex pipiens and Culex modestus but not in Culex torrentium mosquitoes across the four collection sites. Furthermore, multi-resistance or cross-resistance in Culex pipiens could be a threat in these areas, as both mutations were observed at low frequencies.\n\nThese results provide the first report of kdr L1014F and ace-1 G119S resistance in Culex pipiens and Culex modestus mosquitoes from Belgium, highlighting the importance of mosquito surveillance to design effective arbovirus outbreak control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Craniofacial disorders are among the most common of all congenital defects. A majority of craniofacial development occurs early in pregnancy and to fully understand how craniofacial defects arise, it is essential to observe gene expression during this critical time period. To address this we performed bulk and single-cell RNA-seq on human craniofacial tissue from embryonic development 4 to 8 weeks post conception. This data comprises the most comprehensive profiling of the transcriptome in the early developing human face to date. We identified 239 genes that were specifically expressed in craniofacial tissues relative to dozens of other human tissues and stages. We found that craniofacial specific enhancers are enriched within 400kb of these genes establishing putative regulatory interactions. To further understand how genes are organized in this program we constructed coexpression networks. Strong disease candidates are likely genes that are coexpressed with many other genes, serving as regulatory hubs within these networks. We leveraged large functional genomics databases including GTEx and GnomAD to reveal hub genes that are specifically expressed in craniofacial tissue and genes which are resistant to mutation in the normal healthy population. Our unbiased method revealed dozens of novel disease candidate genes that warrant further study.",

Gc is a prominent threat to human health by causing severe and lifelong clinical sequelae, including infertility and chronic pelvic pain, which is amplified by the emergence of \"superbug\" strains that are resistant to all current antibiotics. Gc is highly adapted to colonize human mucosal surfaces, where it survives despite initiating a robust inflammatory response and influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or neutrophils) that typically clear bacteria. Here, dual-species RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to define Gc and PMN transcriptional profiles alone and after infection. Three strains of Gc and three human donors transcriptional responses were assessed to characterize core host and bacterial responses. Comparative analysis of Gc transcripts revealed major overlap between the Gc response to PMNs, iron, and hydrogen peroxide; specifically, the TonB system and TonB dependent transporters (TDT) were upregulated in response to PMNs. We experimentally confirmed that induction of the iron-dependent TDT TbpB is responsive to the presence of PMNs and that tonB is required for Gc survival from PMNs. Pathway analysis of PMN transcripts induced by Gc infection revealed differential expression of genes driving pathways involved in cell adhesion and migration, inflammatory responses, and inflammation resolution. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL1B and IL8, the adhesion factor ICAM1, and the anti-inflammatory prostaglandin PGE2 was confirmed to be induced in PMNs in response to Gc. Together, this study represents a comprehensive and experimentally validated dual-species transcriptomic analysis of three isolates of Gc and primary human PMNs that gives insight into how this bacterium survives innate immune onslaught to cause disease in humans.",

    "abstract": "Guanosine 5-monophosphate (GMP) synthetases, enzymes that catalyze the conversion of xanthosine 5-monophosphate (XMP) to GMP are comprised of two different catalytic units, which are either two domains of a polypeptide chain or two subunits that associate to form a complex. The glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) unit hydrolyzes glutamine generating ammonia and the ATP pyrophosphatase (ATPPase) unit catalyzes the formation of AMP-XMP intermediate. The substrate-bound ATPPase allosterically activates GATase and the ammonia thus generated is tunnelled to the ATPPase active site where it reacts with AMP-XMP generating GMP. In ammonia tunnelling enzymes reported thus far, a tight complex of the two subunits is observed, while the interaction of the two subunits of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii GMP synthetase (MjGMPS) is transient with the underlying mechanism of allostery and substrate channelling largely unclear. Here, we present a mechanistic model encompassing the various steps in the catalytic cycle of MjGMPS based on biochemical experiments, crystal structure and cross-linking mass spectrometry guided integrative modelling. pH dependence of enzyme kinetics establish that ammonia is tunnelled across the subunits with the lifetime of the complex being [&le;] 0.5 s. The crystal structure of XMP-bound ATPPase subunit reported herein highlights the role of conformationally dynamic loops in enabling catalysis. The structure of MjGMPS derived using restraints obtained from cross-linking mass spectrometry has enabled the visualization of subunit interactions that enable allostery under catalytic conditions. We integrate the results and propose a functional mechanism for MjGMPS detailing the various steps involved in catalysis.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/481963v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eb7261org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a25d02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1885ed7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab189_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase (Pol) III is specialized to transcribe short, abundant RNAs, for which it terminates transcription on poly-thymine (dT) stretches on the non-template (NT) strand. When Pol III reaches the termination signal, it pauses and forms the pre-termination complex (PTC). Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the yeast Pol III PTC and complementary functional states at 2.7-3.9 [A] resolution. Pol III recognizes the poly-dT termination signal with subunit C128 that forms a hydrogen-bond network with the NT-strand and, thereby, induces pausing. Mutating key interacting residues interferes with transcription termination in vitro, impairs yeast growth, and causes global termination defects in vivo confirming our structural results. Additional cryo-EM analysis reveals that C53-C37, a Pol III subcomplex and key termination factor, participates indirectly in Pol III termination. We propose a mechanistic model of Pol III transcription termination and rationalize why Pol III, unlike Pol I and Pol II, terminates on poly-dT signals.",

    "abstract": "Two decades have passed since the initial proposition that amyloids are not only (toxic) byproducts of an unintended aggregation cascade, but that they can also be produced by an organism to serve a defined biological function. That revolutionary idea was borne out of the realization that a large fraction of the extracellular matrix that holds Gram-negative cells into a persistent biofilm is composed of protein fibers (curli; tafi) with cross-{beta} architecture, nucleation-dependent polymerization kinetics and classic amyloid tinctorial properties. The list of proteins shown to form so-called  functional amyloid fibers in vivo has greatly expanded over the years, but detailed structural insights have not followed at a similar pace, in part due to the associated experimental barriers. Here we combine extensive AlphaFold2 modelling and cryo-electron transmission microscopy to propose an atomic model of curli protofibrils, and their higher modes of organization. We uncover an unexpected structural diversity of curli building blocks and fibril architectures. Our results allow for a rationalization of the extreme physico-chemical robustness of curli, as well as earlier observations of inter-species curli promiscuity, and should facilitate further engineering efforts to expand the repertoire of curli-based functional materials.",

    "abstract": "The mass spectrometry based multi-attribute method (MAM) has gained popularity in the field of biopharmaceutical analysis as it promises a single method for comprehensive monitoring of multiple product quality attributes (PQAs) and product purity. Sample preparation for protein digestion and peptide separation are critical considerations for a reduced peptide mapping-based MAM. To avoid desalting steps required in tryptic protein digestion and in order to improve peptide separation for hydrophilic peptides, we developed an improved robust sample preparation using Lys-C protease for high-throughput MAM testing. Additionally, this method optimizes the peptide retention and separation of a stability-indicating VSNK peptide using a HSS T3 column for comprehensive PQA monitoring. A fully automated sample preparation had similar assay variations for PQAs monitoring compared to manual sample preparation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a high-resolution MS-based MAM using Lys-C digestion with enhanced PQA monitoring for hydrophilic peptides. The improved, robust MAM workflow for protein digestion and peptide separation will pave the way for broader MAM qualification and its applications for the characterization and quality control of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.",

    "abstract": "TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is closely related to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and translocates to stress granules (SGs). The role of SGs as aggregation-promoting \"bioreactors\" for TDP-43, however, is still under debate. We analyzed TDP-43 mobility and localization under different stress and recovery conditions using live cell single-molecule tracking and super-resolution microscopy. Besides reduced mobility within SGs, a stress induced decrease of TDP-43 mobility in the cytoplasm and the nucleus was observed. Stress removal led to a recovery of TDP-43 mobility, which strongly depended on the stress duration.  Stimulated-emission depletion microscopy (STED) and  tracking and localization microscopy (TALM) revealed not only TDP-43 substructures within stress granules but also numerous patches of slow TDP-43 species throughout the cytoplasm. The data provide new insights into the aggregation of TDP-43 in living cells and provide evidence suggesting that TDP-43 oligomerization takes place in the cytoplasm separate from SGs.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock of cyanobacteria is based on an approximately 24h rhythm in the phosphorylation level of KaiC, a hexameric ATPase. This oscillation can be reconstituted in vitro by incubating three proteins together with ATP. Like all chemical oscillators, this system must include a nonlinear, or switch-like, feedback loop, whose nature has been unclear. Here, by using single particle cryo-EM at near-atomic resolution we identified two major conformational states of KaiC subunits, denoted as the exposed state and the buried state, which may provide a structural basis of how the KaiC hexamer changes its conformation during the (day-night) phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. We classify the abundance and pattern of exposed and buried states within hexamers for more than 160,000 KaiC particles. The statistics of the spatial arrangement of the two states in hexamers can be quantitatively fit by a simple statistical physics model with an interaction energy between neighboring subunits and a local field that depends on phosphorylation state. Our study shows that phosphorylation shifts the probability of each conformation and reveals that there is substantial cooperativity between neighboring subunits, which can allow a KaiC hexamer to respond in an ultrasensitive, switch-like manner to changes in the phosphorylation level.",

    "abstract": "Mutationally-activated BRAFV600E is detected in ~2% of all human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and serves as a predictive biomarker for treatment of patients with FDA-approved pathway-targeted therapies that inhibit signaling by the BRAFV600E oncoprotein kinase. In genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models, expression of BRAFV600E in alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes initiates the development of benign lung tumors that, without additional genetic alterations, rarely progress to malignant lung adenocarcinomas. To identify genes that might cooperate with BRAFV600E for malignant lung cancer progression we employed Sleeping Beauty (SB)-mediated transposon mutagenesis, which dramatically accelerated the onset of lethal lung adenocarcinomas. Amongst the diverse group of genes identified by this in vivo screen was Rbms3 (RNA binding motif single-stranded interacting protein 3), an RNA-binding protein implicated as a possible tumor suppressor. Using CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing we confirmed that RBMS3 silencing cooperated with BRAFV600E to promote progression of malignant lung cancer with a distinct micropapillary architecture. Moreover, RBMS3 silencing also cooperated with BRAFV600E to promote the growth of lung organoids in vitro. BRAFV600E/RBMS3Null lung tumors displayed elevated expression of b-catenin (CTNNB1), suggesting that RBMS3 silencing may result in elevated signaling through the WNT>CTNNB1>c-MYC pathway. Finally, analyses of patient samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that the region of chromosome 3 encompassing RBMS3 is frequently lost in NSCLC and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Collectively, SB-mediated transposon mutagenesis has revealed the ability of a novel tumor suppressor, RBMS3, to cooperate with BRAFV600E to promote lung carcinogenesis, and suggests that RBMS3 silencing may contribute to malignant progression of numerous human lung cancers.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe BRAFV600E oncoprotein kinase is a potent initiator of benign lung tumorigenesis, but is insufficient to elicit malignant lung adenocarcinoma without additional cooperating alterations. Sleeping Beauty-mediated transposon mutagenesis has revealed a number of genes that cooperate with BRAFV600E to promote lung cancer progression, in particular Rbms3, which encodes an RNA binding protein. Hence, this genetic screen provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BRAFV600E-driven lung carcinogenesis, and is an important step improving our ability to successfully target this disease.",

Using DTox, we were able to rediscover mechanisms of transcription activation by three nuclear receptors, recapitulate cellular activities induced by aromatase inhibitors and PXR agonists, and differentiate distinctive mechanisms leading to HepG2 cytotoxicity. Virtual screening by DTox revealed that compounds with predicted cytotoxicity are at higher risk for clinical hepatic phenotypes.

Through genome-wide analysis of human endometriotic epithelial cells, we show that more than half of ARID1A binding sites are marked by the variant histone H3.3, including active regulatory elements. ARID1A loss leads to H3.3 depletion at ARID1A bound active regulatory elements and a concomitant redistribution of H3.3 towards genic elements. ARID1A interactions with the repressive chromatin remodeler CHD4 (NuRD) are associated with H3.3-containing chromatin regulation. ZMYND8, the CHD4-interacting acetyl-histone H4 reader, specifies ARID1A-CHD4-H3.3 target regulatory activity towards histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) to repress super-enhancers. ARID1A, H3.3, CHD4, and ZMYND8 co-repress the expression of genes governing extracellular matrix, motility, adhesion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, these gene expression alterations are observed in human endometriomas. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that cooperation among a histone reader and different types of chromatin remodelers safeguards the endometrium through transcriptionally repressive H3.3.",

Of the two UFM1-specific proteases (UFSPs) identified in humans, only UFSP2 is reported to be active since the annotated sequence of UFSP1 lacks critical catalytic residues. Nonetheless, efficient UFM1 maturation occurs in cells lacking UFSP2 suggesting the presence of another active protease. We hereby identify a long isoform of UFSP1 to be this protease. Cells lacking both UFSPs show complete loss of UFMylation resulting from an absence of mature UFM1. While UFSP2, but not UFSP1, removes UFM1 from the ribosomal subunit RPL26, UFSP1 acts earlier in the pathway to mature UFM1 and cleave a potential auto-inhibitory modification on UFC1, thereby controlling activation of UFMylation. In summary, our studies reveal important distinctions in substrate specificity and localization-dependent functions for the two proteases in regulating UFMylation.",
