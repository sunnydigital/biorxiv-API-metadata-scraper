    "abstract": "1Knowledge of speech and music depends upon the ability to perceive relationships between sounds in order to form a stable mental representation of statistical structure. Although evidence exists for the learning of musical scale structure from the statistical properties of sound events, little research has been able to observe how specific acoustic features contribute to statistical learning independent of the effects of long-term exposure. Here, using a new musical system, we show that spectral content is an important cue for acquiring musical scale structure. In two experiments, participants completed probe-tone ratings before and after a half-hour period of exposure to melodies in a novel musical scale with a predefined statistical structure. In Experiment 1, participants were randomly assigned to either a no-exposure control group, or to exposure groups who heard pure tone or complex tone sequences. In Experiment 2, participants were randomly assigned to exposure groups who heard complex tones constructed with odd harmonics or even harmonics. Learning outcome was assessed by correlating pre/post-exposure ratings and the statistical structure of tones within the exposure period. Spectral information significantly affected sensitivity to statistical structure: participants were able to learn after exposure to all tested timbres, but did best at learning with timbres with odd harmonics, which were congruent with scale structure. Results show that spectral amplitude distribution is a useful cue for statistical learning, and suggest that musical scale structure might be acquired through exposure to spectral distribution in sounds.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, resulting in over 200 million infections and 400,000 deaths every year. A critical step of malaria infection is when sporozoites, injected by mosquitoes, travel to the liver and form liver stages. Malaria vaccine candidates which induce large numbers of malaria-specific CD8 T cells in mice are able to eliminate all liver stages, preventing fulminant malaria. However, how CD8 T cells find all parasites in 48 hours of the liver stage lifespan is not well understood. Using intravital microscopy of murine livers, we generated unique data on T cell search for malaria liver stages within a few hours after infection. To detect attraction of T cells to an infection site, we used the von Mises-Fisher distribution in 3D, similar to the 2D von Mises distribution previously used in ecology. Our results suggest that the vast majority (70-95%) of malaria-specific and non-specific liver-localized CD8 T cells did not display attraction towards the infection site, suggesting that the search for malaria liver stages occurs randomly. However, a small fraction (15-20%) displayed weak but detectable attraction towards parasites which already had been surrounded by several T cells. We found that speeds and turning angles correlated with attraction, suggesting that understanding mechanisms that determine the speed of T cell movement in the liver may improve the efficacy of future T cell-based vaccines. Stochastic simulations suggest that a small movement bias towards the parasite dramatically reduces the number of CD8 T cells needed to eliminate all malaria liver stages, but to detect such attraction by individual cells requires data from long imaging experiments which are not currently feasible. Importantly, as far as we know this is the first demonstration of how activated/memory CD8 T cells might search for the pathogen in nonlymphoid tissues a few hours after infection. We have also established a framework for how attraction of individual T cells towards a location in 3D can be rigorously evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Land abandonment may decrease biodiversity but also provides an opportunity for rewilding. It is therefore necessary to identify areas that may benefit from traditional land management practices and those that may benefit from a lack of human intervention. In this study, we conducted comparative field surveys of butterfly occurrence in abandoned and inhabited settlements in 18 regions of diverse climatic zones in Japan to test the hypotheses that species-specific responses to land abandonment correlate with climatic niches and habitat preferences. Hierarchical models that unified species occurrence and habitat preferences revealed that negative responses to land abandonment were associated with species that have cold climatic niches and utilize open habitats, suggesting that species negatively impacted by land abandonment will decline more due to future climate warming. Maps representing species gains and losses due to land abandonment, which were created from the model estimates, showed similar geographic patterns, but some areas exhibited high species losses relative to gains. Our hierarchical modelling approach was useful for scaling up local-scale effects of land abandonment to a macro-scale assessment, which is crucial to developing spatial conservation strategies in the era of depopulation.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics generates vast amounts of signal data that require computational interpretation to obtain peptide identifications. Dozens of algorithms for this task exist, but all exploit only part of the acquired data to judge a peptide-to-spectrum match (PSM), ignoring important information such as the observed retention time and fragment ion peak intensity pattern. Moreover, only few identification algorithms allow open modification searches that can substantially increase peptide identifications.\n\nWe here therefore introduce ionbot, a novel open modification search engine that is the first to fully merge machine learning with peptide identification. This core innovation brings the ability to include a much larger range of experimental data into PSM scoring, and even to adapt this scoring to the specifics of the data itself. As a result, ionbot substantially increases PSM confidence for open searches, and even enables a further increase in peptide identification rate of up to 12% by also considering lower-ranked, co-eluting matches for a fragmentation spectrum. Moreover, the exclusive use of machine learning for scoring also means that any future improvements to predictive models for peptide behavior will also result in more sensitive and accurate peptide identification.",

    "abstract": "While inflammation has been implicated in psychopathology, relationships between immune-suppressing processes and psychiatric constructs remain elusive. This study sought to assess whether {beta}2-agonist clenbuterol (CBL) would attenuate immune activation in adolescents with mood and anxiety symptoms following ex vivo exposure of whole blood to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our focus on adolescents aimed to target a critical developmental period when psychiatric conditions often emerge and prior to chronicity effects. To capture a diverse range of immunologic and symptomatologic phenotypes, we included 97 psychotropic-medication free adolescents with mood and anxiety symptoms and 33 healthy controls. All participants had comprehensive evaluations and dimensional assessments of psychiatric symptoms. Fasting whole-blood samples were collected and stimulated with LPS in the presence and absence of CBL for 6 hours, then analyzed for 41 cytokines, chemokines, and hematopoietic growth factors. Comparison analyses used Bonferroni-corrected nonparametric tests. Levels of nine immune biomarkers--including IL-1RA, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1{beta}, TGF-, and TNF---were significantly reduced by CBL treatment compared to LPS alone. Exploratory factor analysis reduced 41 analytes into 5 immune factors in each experimental condition, and their relationships with psychiatric symptoms were examined as a secondary aim. CBL+LPS Factor 4--comprising EGF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, sCD40L, and GRO--significantly correlated with anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia, even after controlling for depression severity. This study supports the possible inhibitory effect of CBL on immune activation. Using a data-driven method, distinctive relationships between CBL-affected immune biomarkers and dimensional anhedonia were reported, further elucidating the role of {beta}2-agonism in adolescent affective symptomatology.",

    "abstract": "Usutu virus (USUV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are phylogenetically close emerging arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes, and constitute a global public health threat. Since USUV and WNV enter the body through the skin, the first immune cells they encounter are skin-resident dendritic cells, the most peripheral outpost of immune defense. This unique network is composed of Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal DCs, which reside in the epidermis and the dermis, respectively.\n\nUsing human skin explants, we show that while both viruses can replicate in keratinocytes, they can also infect resident DCs with distinct tropism, since WNV preferentially infects DCs in the dermis, whereas USUV has a greater propensity to infect LCs. Using both purified human epidermal LCs (eLCs) and monocyte derived LCs (MoLCs), we confirm that LCs sustain a faster and more efficient replication of USUV compared with WNV and that this correlates with a more intense innate immune response to USUV compared with WNV. Next, we show that ectopic expression of the LC-specific C-type lectin receptor (CLR), langerin, in HEK293T cells allows WNV and USUV to bind and enter, but supports the subsequent replication of USUV only. Conversely, blocking or silencing langerin in MoLCs or eLCs made them resistant to USUV infection, thus demonstrating that USUV uses langerin to enter and replicate in LCs. Altogether, our results demonstrate that LCs constitute privileged target cells for USUV in human skin, because langerin favors its entry and replication. Intriguingly, this suggests that USUV efficiently escapes the antiviral functions of langerin, which normally safeguards LCs from most viral infections.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTime-lapse microscopy has been widely used in biomedical experiments because it can visualize the molecular activities of living cells in real time. However, biomedical researchers are still conducting cell lineage analysis manually. Developing automatic lineage tracing algorithms is a challenging task. In the past two decades, deep neural networks (DNNs) became have shown outstanding performance on computer vision tasks. They can learn complex visual features, capture long-range temporal dependencies, and have the potential to be used for automatic cell lineage analysis.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we propose a multi-task spatio-temporal feature based deep neural network for cell lineages analysis (Cell-STN). The Cell-STN extracts spatio-temporal features from microscopy image sequences by leveraging our convolutional long short-term memory based core block. And the proposed Cell-STN utilized a task specific network to predict the cell location, the mitosis event, and the apoptosis event in a multi-task manner.\n\nResultsWe evaluated the Cell-STN on three in-house datasets (MCF7, U2OS, and HCT116) and one public dataset (Fluo-N2DL-HeLa). For cell tracking, we used peak-wise precision, track-wise precision, end-peak precision, and spatial distance as metrics. The overall results showed the Cell-STN models outperform other state-of-the-art cell trackers. For mitosis and apoptosis tasks, we used accuracy, F1-score, temporal distance, and spatial distance as metrics. The Cell-STN models achieved the highest performance on all datasets.\n\nConclusionThis study presented a novel DNNs approach for cell lineage analysis in microscopy images. The Cell-STN showed outstanding performance on the four datasets. Additionally, the Cell-STN required minimal training data and can be adapted to new biological event detection tasks by appending task-specific layers. This algorithm has the potential to be used in real-world biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Human decisions are known to be strongly influenced by the manner in which options are presented, the \"framing effect\". Here, we ask whether decision-makers are also influenced by how advice from other knowledgeable agents are framed, a \"social framing effect\". For example, do students learn better from a teacher who often frames advice by emphasizing appetitive outcomes, or do they learn better from another teacher who usually emphasizes avoiding options that can be harmful to their progress? We study the computational and neural mechanisms by which framing of advice affect decision-making, social learning, and trust. We found that human participants are more likely to trust and follow an adviser who often uses an appetitive frame for advice compared with another one who often uses an aversive frame. This social framing effect is implemented through a modulation of the integrative abilities of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. At the time of choice, this region combines information learned via personal experiences of reward with social information, but the combination differs depending on the social framing of advice. Personally-acquired information is weighted more strongly when dealing with an adviser who uses an aversive frame. The findings suggest that social advice is systematically incorporated into our decisions, while being affected by biases similar to those influencing individual value-based learning.",

The overall proportion of ARG hits was similar to that found in temperate-zone rural water bodies with moderate human inputs. Specific ARGs showed distinct distributions for the two lakes, and for mat versus planktonic sources. Metagenomic taxa distributions showed that mat phototrophs consisted mainly of cyanobacteria or betaproteobacteria, whereas the water column phototrophs were mainly protists. An enrichment culture of the betaproteobacterium Rhodoferax antarcticus from a Lake Fryxell mat sample showed an unusual mat-forming phenotype not previously reported for this species. Its genome showed no ARGs associated with betaproteobacteria, but had ARGs consistent with a minor Pseudomonas component.

As cells commit to a specific lineage, chromatin dynamics and developmental plasticity generally become more limited. However, it remains unclear how differentiated cardiomyocytes (CMs) undergo morphological and functional adaptations to the postnatal environment during their maturation. In this work, we sought to identify the regulatory mechanisms controlling postnatal cardiac gene networks. A time-series transcriptomic analysis of postnatal hearts revealed an integrated, time-ordered transcriptional network that regulates CM maturation. Remarkably, depletion of histone H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF20 after formation of the four-chamber heart disrupted these highly coordinated gene networks. Its ablation also caused early-onset cardiomyopathy, a phenotype reminiscent of CHD. Furthermore, we found that dynamic RNF20-mediated modulation of chromatin accessibility during CM maturation was necessary for the operative binding of cardiac transcription factors known to drive transcriptional gene networks. Together, our results reveal how epigenetic-mediated chromatin state transitions modulate time-ordered gene expression during CM maturation.",

    "abstract": "In order to automate the genome sequencing pipeline in our laboratory, we programmed a dual-arm anthropomorphic robot, the Robotic Biology Institutes Maholo LabDroid, to perform organic solvent-based genomic DNA extraction from cell lysates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that automation of phenol-chloroform extraction has been reported. We achieved routine extraction of high molecular weight genomic DNA (>100 kb) from diverse biological samples including algae cultured in sea water, bacteria, whole insects, and human cell lines. The results of pulse-field electrophoresis size analysis and the N50 sequencing metrics of reads obtained from Nanopore MinION runs verified the presence of intact DNA suitable for direct sequencing. We present the workflow that can be used to program similar robots and discuss the problems and solutions we encountered in developing the workflow. The protocol can be adapted to analogous methods such as RNA extraction, and there is ongoing work to incorporate further post-extraction steps such as library construction. This work shows the potential for automated robotic workflows to free molecular biological researchers from manual interventions in routine experimental work. A time-lapse movie of the entire automated run can be seen at http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.17097065",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance remains a central challenge towards durable cancer therapy, including for cancers driven by the EML4-ALK oncogene. EML4-ALK and related fusion oncogenes form cytoplasmic protein condensates that transmit oncogenic signals through the Ras/Erk pathway. However, whether such condensates play a role in drug response is unclear. Here, we used optogenetics to find that condensates suppress signaling through endogenous RTKs including EGFR. Notably, ALK inhibition hypersensitized RTK signals, which are known to drive resistance. Suppression of RTKs occurred because condensates sequestered downstream adapter proteins that are required for RTK signal transmission. Strikingly, EGFR hypersensitization resulted in rapid and pulsatile Erk signal reactivation, which originated from neighboring apoptotic cells. Paracrine signals promoted survival during ALK inhibition, and blockade of paracrine signals suppressed drug tolerance. Our results uncover a regulatory role for RTK fusion condensates in cancer drug response and demonstrate the potential of optogenetics for uncovering functional biomarkers of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a widely used high-throughput method to characterize transcriptomic dynamics spatiotemporally. However, typical RNA-seq data analysis pipelines depend on either a sequenced genome or corresponding reference transcripts or them both. This restriction makes the use of RNA-seq for species lacking both of sequenced genomes and corresponding reference transcripts challenging. Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) is a diurnal rodent species with several unique characteristics making it as a useful model to study diet-induced type 2 diabetes and other physiological or behavioral processes due to its diurnal nature. However, there is neither a high-quality annotated Nile grass rat genome nor a reference transcript sets available so far, making it technically challenging to perform large-scale RNA-seq based transcriptomic studies. Although we are working on the first draft of Nile grass rat genome, a well annotated genome typically requires several rounds of manually reviewing curated transcripts and can take years to achieve. To solve this problem, we developed a Comparative RNA-Seq Pipeline (CRSP), integrating a comparative species strategy but not depending on a specific sequenced genome or species-matched reference transcripts. Benchmarking suggests the CRSP tool can achieve high accuracy to quantify gene expression levels. In this study, we generated the first ultra-deep (2.3 billion x 2 paired-end) Nile grass rat RNA-seq data from 59 biopsy samples representing 22 major organs, providing a unique resource and spatial gene expression reference for using Nile grass rat as a model to study human diseases.

    "abstract": "IL-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases, but conversely is essential for host defense against fungi. Antibody-based biologic drugs that neutralize IL-17 are effective in autoimmunity but can be accompanied by adverse side effects. Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that is the primary causative agent of oropharyngeal and disseminated candidiasis. Defects in IL-17 signaling cause susceptibility to candidiasis in mice and humans. A key facet of IL-17 receptor signaling involves RNA binding proteins (RBP), which orchestrate the fate of target mRNA transcripts. In tissue culture models we showed that the RBP AT-rich interacting protein 5a (Arid5a) promotes the stability and/or translation of multiple IL-17-dependent mRNAs. Moreover, during OPC, Arid5a is elevated within the oral mucosa in an IL-17-dependent manner. However, the contribution of Arid5a to IL-17-driven events in vivo is poorly defined. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mice lacking Arid5a. Arid5a-/- mice were fully resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an autoimmune setting in which IL-17 signaling drives pathology. Surprisingly, Arid5a-/- mice were resistant to OPC and systemic candidiasis, similar to immunocompetent WT mice and contrasting with mice defective in IL-17 signaling. Therefore, Arid5a-dependent signals mediate pathology in autoimmunity yet are not required for immunity to candidiasis, indicating that selective targeting of IL-17 signaling pathway components may be a viable strategy for development of therapeutics that spare IL-17-driven host defense.",

Currently, a significant roadblock to this application is the potential for deactivating mutations in engineered genes. A recently developed method to protect engineered coding sequences from mutation is called Constraining Adaptive Mutations using Engineered Overlapping Sequences (CAMEOS). In this chapter we provide a workflow for utilising CAMEOS to create synthetic overlaps between two genes, one essential (infA) and one non-essential (aroB), to protect the non-essential gene from mutation and loss of protein function. In this workflow we detail the methods to collect large numbers of related protein sequences, produce multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), use the MSAs to generate Hidden Markov Models and Markov Random Field models, and finally generate a library of overlapping coding sequences through CAMEOS scripts. To assist practitioners with basic coding skills to try out the CAMEOS method, we have created a virtual machine containing all the required packages already installed, that can be downloaded and run locally.",

However, whether and how the functional connectome individual variability architecture is structurally constrained remains largely unknown. Using tractography- and morphometry-based network models, we observed the spatial convergence of structural and functional connectome individual variability, with higher variability in heteromodal association regions and lower variability in primary regions. We demonstrated that functional variability is significantly predicted by a unifying structural variability pattern and that this prediction follows a primary-to-heteromodal hierarchical axis, with higher accuracy in primary regions and lower accuracy in heteromodal regions. We further decomposed group-level connectome variability patterns into individual unique contributions and uncovered the structural-functional correspondence that is associated with individual cognitive traits. These results advance our understanding of the structural basis of individual functional variability and suggest the importance of integrating multimodal connectome signatures for individual differences in cognition and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Identifying new binding sites and poses that modify biological function are an important step towards drug discovery. We have identified a novel disulphide constrained peptide that interacts with the cap-binding site of eIF4E, an attractive therapeutic target that is commonly overexpressed in many cancers and plays a significant role in initiating a cancer specific protein synthesis program though binding the 5cap (7methyl-guanoisine) moiety found on mammalian mRNAs. The use of disulphide constrained peptides to explore intracellular biological targets is limited by their lack of cell permeability and the instability of the disulphide bond in the reducing environment of the cell, loss of which results in abrogation of binding. To overcome these challenges, the cap-binding site interaction motif was placed in a hypervariable loop on an VH domain, and then selections performed to select a molecule that could recapitulate the interaction of the peptide with the target of interest in a process termed Peptide Epitope Linker Evolution (PELE). A novel VH domain was identified that interacted with the eIF4E cap binding site with a nanomolar affinity and that could be intracellularly expressed in mammalian cells. Additionally, it was demonstrated to specifically modulate eIF4E function by decreasing cap-dependent translation and cyclin D1 expression, common effects of eIF4F complex disruption.",

    "abstract": "Individual-level monitoring is essential in many behavioural and bioacoustics studies. Collecting and annotating those data is costly in terms of human effort, but necessary prior to conducting analysis. In particular, many studies on bird vocalisations also involve manipulating the animals or human presence during observations, which may bias vocal production. Autonomous recording units can be used to collect large amounts of data without human supervision, largely removing those sources of bias. Deep learning can further facilitate the annotation of large amounts of data, for instance to detect vocalisations, identify the species, or recognise the vocalisation types in recordings. Acoustic individual identification, however, has so far largely remained limited to a single vocalisation type for a given species. This has limited the use of those techniques for automated data collection on raw recordings, where many individuals can produce vocalisations of varying complexity, potentially overlapping one another, with the additional presence of unknown and varying background noise. This paper aims at bridging this gap by developing a system to identify individual animals in those difficult conditions. Our system leverages a combination of multi-scale information integration, multi-channel audio and multi-task learning. The multi-task learning paradigm is based the overall task into four sub-tasks, three of which are auxiliary tasks: the detection and segmentation of vocalisations against other noises, the classification of individuals vocalising at any point during a sample, and the sexing of detected vocalisations. The fourth task is the overall identification of individuals. To test our approach, we recorded a captive group of rooks, a Eurasian social corvid with a diverse vocal repertoire. We used a multi-microphone array and collected a large scale dataset of time-stamped and identified vocalisations recorded, and found the system to work reliably for the defined tasks. To our knowledge, the system is the first to acoustically identify individuals regardless of the vocalisation produced. Our system can readily assist data collection and individual monitoring of groups of animals in both outdoor and indoor settings, even across long periods of time, and regardless of a species vocal complexity. All data and code used in this article is available online.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the effects of missense mutations on protein stability is a widely acknowledged significant biological problem. Genomic missense mutations may alter one or more amino acids leading to increased or decreased stability of the encoded proteins. In this study, we propose a novel approach - Protein Stability Prediction with a Gaussian Network Model (PSP-GNM) to study the effect of single amino acid substitutions on protein stability. Specifically, PSP-GNM employs a coarse-grained Gaussian Network Model (GNM) that has interactions between amino acids weighted by the Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) statistical potential. We use PSP-GNM to simulate partial unfolding of the wildtype and mutant structures and then, use the difference in energies of the unfolded wildtype and mutant protein structures to estimate the experimentally obtained unfolding free energy change ({Delta}{Delta}G). We verify the extent of correspondence between the {Delta}{Delta}G calculated by PSP-GNM and the {Delta}{Delta}G obtained experimentally using three datasets: 350 forward mutations from 66 proteins, 2298 forward mutations from 126 proteins and 611 forward and reverse mutations from 66 proteins and observe Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) as high as 0.58 and root mean-squared error (RMSE) as low as 1.24 kcal/mol. The performance is comparable to the existing state of the art methods. Importantly, we do observe an increase in the correlation to 0.73 and decrease in RMSE to 1.07 when considering only those measurements made close to 25{degrees}C and neutral pH, suggesting a strong dependence on temperature and pH. PSP-GNM is written in Python and is available as a free downloadable package at https://github.com/sambitmishra0628/PSP-GNM.\n\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding how genomic missense mutations impact the thermodynamic stability of encoded proteins is important to understand disease etiology. Specifically, mutant proteins are often functionally inactive and underlie numerous genetic and neurodegenerative diseases. A classic example is sickle cell anemia - a single amino acid change significantly affects hemoglobins binding affinity for oxygen. To be able to identify mutations that would likely impact the protein function and stability is therefore essential and is the focus of our study. We present an approach that relies on utilizing the intrinsic dynamics of protein structures to predict the effect of single amino acid mutations (point mutations) on protein stability. In our approach, we model proteins as coarse-grained beads (amino acids) and springs (interactions), simulate protein unfolding and identify putative residue-residue contacts that are broken during the unfolding process. We demonstrate that the knowledge of broken contacts and their order is essential in describing the thermodynamic differences between wildtype and mutant proteins. We also highlight the importance of residue-residue interactions at the mutation site in the context of protein stability prediction. Our findings present novel avenues to interpret how genomic mutations may manifest in the encoded proteins.",

    "abstract": "Serial RNA-seq studies of bulk samples are widespread and provide an opportunity for improved understanding of gene regulation during e.g., development or response to an incremental dose of a pharmacotherapeutic. In addition, the widely popular single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data implicitly exhibit serial characteristics because measured gene expression values recapitulate cellular transitions. Unfortunately serial RNA-seq data continue to be analyzed by methods that ignore this ordinal structure and yield results that are difficult to interpret. Here, we present Error Modelled Gene Expression Analysis (EMOGEA), a principled framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that incorporates measurement uncertainty in the analysis, while introducing a special formulation for modelling data that are acquired as a function of time or other continuous variable. By incorporating uncertainties in the analysis, EMOGEA is specifically suited for RNA-seq studies in which low-count transcripts with small fold-changes lead to significant biological effects. Such transcripts include signaling mRNAs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) that are known to exhibit low levels of expression. Through this approach, missing values are handled by associating with them disproportionately large uncertainties which makes it particularly useful for single cell RNA-seq data. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by extracting a cascade of gene expression waves from a well-designed RNA-seq study of zebrafish embryogenesis and, a scRNA-seq study of mouse pre-implantation and provide unique biological insights into the regulation of genes in each wave. For non-ordinal measurements, we show that EMOGEA has a much higher rate of true positive calls and a vanishingly small rate for false negative discoveries compared to common approaches. Finally, we provide an R package (https://github.com/itikadi/EMOGEA) that is self-contained and easy to use.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/481000v1_figG1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18f3f99org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1989635org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad964borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6650be_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical Abstract:C_FLOATNO Graphical representation of EMOGEA indicating the incorporation of measurement errors in modeling RNA-seq data to generate superior results in exploratory analysis, differential gene expression analyses and, scRNA-seq and Time Course analyses.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Propofol-mediated unconsciousness elicits strong alpha/low-beta and slow oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients. As anesthetic dose increases, the EEG signal changes in ways that give clues to the level of unconsciousness; the network mechanisms of these changes are only partially understood. Here, we construct a biophysical thalamocortical network involving brainstem influences that reproduces transitions in dynamics seen in the EEG involving the evolution of the power and frequency of alpha/low beta and slow rhythm, as well as their interactions.\n\nOur model suggests propofol engages thalamic spindle and cortical sleep mechanisms to elicit persistent alpha/low-beta and slow rhythms, respectively. The thalamocortical network fluctuates between two mutually exclusive states on the timescale of seconds. One state is characterized by continuous alpha/low-beta frequency spiking in thalamus (C-state), while in the other, thalamic alpha spiking is interrupted by periods of co-occurring thalamic and cortical silence (I-state). In the I-state, alpha co-localizes to the peak of the slow; in the C-state, there is a variable relationship between an alpha/beta rhythm and the slow oscillation. The C-state predominates near loss of consciousness; with increasing dose, the proportion of time spent in the I-state increases, recapitulating EEG phenomenology. Cortical synchrony drives the switch to the I-state by changing the nature of the thalamocortical feedback. Brainstem influence on the strength of thalamocortical feedback mediates the amount of cortical synchrony. Our model implicates loss of low-beta, cortical synchrony, and coordinated thalamocortical silent periods as contributing to the unconscious state.\n\nNew & NoteworthyGABAergic anesthetics induce alpha/low-beta and slow oscillations in the EEG, which interact in dose-dependent ways. We construct a thalamocortical model to investigate how these interdependent oscillations change with propofol dose. We find two dynamic states of thalamocortical coordination, which change on the timescale of seconds and dose-dependently mirror known changes in EEG. Thalamocortical feedback determines the oscillatory coupling and power seen in each state, and this is primarily driven by cortical synchrony and brainstem neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "Healthy aging is accompanied by heterogeneous decline of cognitive abilities among individuals, especially during senescence. The mechanisms of this variability are not understood, but have been associated with the reorganization of white matter fiber tracts and the functional co-activations of brain regions. Here, we built a causal inference framework to provide mechanistic insight into the link between structural connectivity and brain function, informed by brain imaging data and network modeling. By applying various degrees of interhemispheric degradation of structural connectivity, we were not only able to reproduce the age-related decline in interhemispheric functional communication and the associated dynamical flexibility, but we obtained an increase of global modulation of structural connectivity over the brain function during senescence. Notably, the increase in modulation between structural connectivity and brian function was higher in magnitude and steeper in its increase in older adults with poor cognitive performance. We independently validated the causal hypothesis of our framework via a Bayesian approach based on deep-learning. The current results might be the first mechanistic demonstration of dedifferentiation and scaffolding during aging leading to cognitive decline demonstrated in a large cohort.",

    "abstract": "The role of the gustatory region of the insular cortex in mediating associative taste learning, such as conditioned taste aversion, has been well studied. However, while associative learning plays a role in some taste behaviors, such as avoidance of toxins, taste stimuli are often encountered by animals in their natural environment without explicit consequences. This type of inconsequential experience with sensory stimuli has been studied in other sensory systems, generally with the finding that neuronal responses habituate with repeated sensory exposure. The present study sought to determine the effect of taste familiarity on population taste coding in mouse gustatory cortex (GC). Using microendoscope calcium imaging, we studied the taste responses of visually identifiable neurons over five days of taste experience, during which animals could freely choose to consume taste stimuli. We found that the number of active cells in insular cortex, as well as the number of cells characterized as taste-responsive, significantly decreased as animals became familiar with taste stimuli. Moreover, the magnitude of taste-evoked excited responses increased, and inhibited responses decreased with experience. By tracking individual neurons over time, we focused on taste coding in a subpopulation of \"stable\" neurons that were present on all days of the taste familiarity paradigm. The population-level response across these stable cells was distinct when taste stimuli were novel but became more intercorrelated among those taste stimuli mice willingly consumed as the stimuli became familiar. Overall, these results highlight the effects of familiarity on taste responses in gustatory cortex.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTregs are crucial for immune regulation, and environment-driven adaptation of effector (e)Tregs is essential for local functioning. However, the extent of human Treg heterogeneity in inflammatory settings is unclear.\n\nMethodsWe combined single-cell RNA- and TCR-sequencing on Tregs derived from 4-6 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) to investigate the functional heterogeneity of human synovial fluid (SF)-derived Tregs from inflamed joints. Confirmation and suppressive function of the identified Treg clusters was assessed by flow cytometry.\n\nResultsFour Treg clusters were identified; incoming, activated eTregs with either a dominant suppressive or cytotoxic profile, and GPR56+CD161+CXCL13+ Tregs. Pseudotime analysis showed differentiation towards either classical eTreg profiles or GPR56+CD161+CXCL13+ Tregs supported by TCR data. Despite its most differentiated phenotype GPR56+CD161+CXCL13+ Tregs were shown to be suppressive. Furthermore, BATF was identified as an overarching eTreg regulator, with the novel Treg-associated regulon BHLHE40 driving differentiation towards GPR56+CD161+CXCL13+ Tregs, and JAZF1 towards classical eTregs.\n\nConclusionOur study reveals a heterogeneous population of Tregs at the site of inflammation in JIA. SF Treg differentiate to a classical eTreg profile with a more dominant suppressive or cytotoxic profile that share a similar TCR repertoire, or towards GPR56+CD161+CXCL13+ Tregs with a more distinct TCR repertoire. Genes characterizing GPR56+CD161+CXCL13+ Tregs were also mirrored in other T-cell subsets in both the tumor and autoimmune setting. Finally, the identified key regulators driving SF Treg adaptation may be interesting targets for autoimmunity or tumor interventions.",

    "abstract": "We perceive the external world through both externally generated and self-generated sensory stimuli (i.e., passive and active perception). While the performance in passive perception is improved by training or repetition through the functional and structural reorganization of the central nervous system (i.e., perceptual learning), the mechanisms by which perceptual learning occurs in active perception remain unclear. Here, we sought to explore the mechanisms underlying the improvement of active somatosensory perception and sensorimotor skills through active perceptual learning. Because we previously found that active perceptual learning depends on the expertise of the motor task to be performed, this study focused primarily on trained individuals. To this end, active haptic training (AHT) that targets the active somatosensory perception during the piano keystroke was used as a means of inducing active perceptual learning. We found four main results. First, participants actively modulated the muscle coordination patterns to optimize the movements required by the task through AHT without any explicit instruction on it by the experimenter, suggesting the involvement of active exploration in active perceptual learning. Second, AHT increased the relative reliance on afferent sensory information relative to the predicted one during the piano keystroke. Third, perceptual sensitivity of externally generated keystroke motions remained unchanged through AHT. Finally, AHT improved feedback control of repetitive keystroke movements in expert pianists. These results suggest that active perceptual learning involves changes in both the predictive integration process and active exploration and that the improved feedback control of fine movements benefits from the improvement in active perception.\n\nSignificant statementOur ability to perceive both externally generated and self-generated sensory stimuli can be enhanced through training, known as passive and active perceptual learning. Here, we sought to explore the mechanisms underlying active perceptual learning by using active haptic training (AHT), which has been demonstrated to enhance the somatosensory perception of a finger in a trained motor skill. First, AHT reorganized the muscular coordination during the piano keystroke. Second, AHT increased the relative reliance on afferent sensory information relative to predicted one, in contrast to no increment of overall perceptual sensitivity. Finally, AHT improved feedback movement control of keystrokes. These results suggest that active perceptual learning involves active exploration and adaptation of predictive sensory integration, which underlies the co-enhancement of active perception and feedback control of movements.",

    "abstract": "Beta oscillations (~13-30 Hz) recorded from the sensorimotor cortex have canonical amplitude changes during movement. Specifically, a movement-related beta decrease (MRBD) occurs before movement, and a post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) follows. We investigated how the MRBD and PMBR vary with movement speed. Individuals performed a task with blocks that generated longer reaction times (RTs) and shorter RTs (Slow and Fast blocks, respectively) while scalp-electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The timing of task events before movement was also modulated to generate blocks with certain and uncertain timing (Fixed and Varied blocks, respectively). Beta modulation was reduced in Slow blocks compared to Fast blocks (i.e., a less negative MRBD and less positive PMBR). For the movement certainty manipulation, we saw mixed behavioral and EEG results. Our primary findings align with previous work which has shown reduced movement-related beta modulation in patients with Parkinsons disease. We propose that a \"slowed movement state\", whether it is experimentally induced or a manifestation of Parkinsons disease bradykinesia, is represented through reduced beta dynamics. Altogether, the MRBD and PMBR may represent motor speed on a continuum with Parkinsons disease as an extreme example of slowed movement.",

    "abstract": "Targeted therapies exploiting selective vulnerabilities of malignant cells are highly desired for clinical applications. The cohesin protein complex comprises of RAD21, SMC3, SMC1A as well as a fourth subunit that consists of either STAG1 or STAG2 and is essential for proper chromosomal segregation during mitosis. STAG2 loss-of-function mutations are recurrent driver events in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and appear relatively early during leukemogenesis. Studies in cell lines have shown that STAG2 deficient cells are uniquely vulnerable to STAG1 perturbation, and this vulnerability could thus be exploited to selectively eliminate STAG2 null AML cells. Here we show that partial perturbation of STAG1 is well tolerated by normal human hematopoietic stem cells and does not affect their functionality. By contrast, STAG1 knockdown is lethal to STAG2 null human HSCs by inducing major mitotic defects. Moreover, STAG1 knockdown induced synthetic lethality in primary human AML cells harboring a STAG2 mutation and completely abrogated leukemia progression in xenograft models. Overall, our study provides proof-of-concept demonstration of a synthetic lethal approach to selectively target primary human cancer cells with STAG2 mutations",

The control beagles (n=5) were given the same dose of normal saline. Then, both groups were monitored by insertable cardiac monitors. Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, electrophysiological and histological examinations were performed 8 weeks later.\n\nResultsIn PAH group, 2 died after the injection (mortality 28.6%). Thus, 10 beagles (PAH group: 5, control group: 5) underwent all the examinations. The pulmonary artery pressure increased significantly while the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle expanded slightly. Spontaneous AF episodes were recorded in all PAH canines 1 week after the injection. The AF burden increased rapidly from 1 week (7.6{+/-}1.8%) and remained high after 2-3 weeks (32.0{+/-}4.9% at 8 weeks). Compared with the control group, the PAH group had abbreviated effective refractory periods (ERPs), increased atrial ERP dispersion, and slower conduction velocities. Notably, AF susceptibility and atrial remodeling in RA was more significant those in LA, such as increased WOV(39.0{+/-}6.5ms vs. 28.0{+/-}5.7ms, P=0.022), enlarged low voltage regions (7.66{+/-}0.46% vs. 4.40{+/-}0.55%, P<0.0001) and fibrosis (8.22{+/-}0.61% vs. 4.93{+/-}0.60%, P <0.0001).\n\nConclusionsDMCT-induced canine PAH model increased the incidence of spontaneous and induced AF.

To unravel the neural basis of this representational structure, we recorded real-life events using wearable camera technology and used fMRI to investigate brain activity during their temporal unfolding in memory. We found that, compared to the representation of static scenes in memory, dynamically unfolding memory representations were associated with greater activation of the posterior medial episodic network. Strikingly, by analyzing the autocorrelation of brain activity patterns at successive time points throughout the retrieval period, we found that this network showed higher temporal dynamics when recalling events that included a higher density of event segments. These results reveal the key role of the posterior medial network in representing the dynamic unfolding of the event segments that constitute real-world memories.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in blood. Recent epidemiological studies are highlighting the link between both diseases; it is even considered that DM might be a risk factor for PD. To further investigate the likely relation of these diseases, we have used a Drosophila PD model based on inactivation of the DJ-1{beta} gene (ortholog of human DJ-1), and diet-induced Drosophila and mouse T2DM models, together with human neuron-like cells. T2DM models were obtained by feeding flies with a high sugar containing medium, and mice with a high fat diet. Our results showed that both fly models exhibit common phenotypes such as alterations in carbohydrate homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction or motor defects, among others. In addition, we demonstrated that T2DM might be a risk factor of developing PD since our diet-induced fly and mouse T2DM models present DA neurodegeneration, a hallmark of PD. We have also confirmed that neurodegeneration is caused by increased glucose levels, which has detrimental effects in human neuron-like cells by triggering apoptosis and leading to cell death. Besides, the observed phenotypes were exacerbated in DJ-1{beta} mutants cultured in the high sugared medium, indicating that DJ-1 might have a role in carbohydrate homeostasis. Finally, we have confirmed that metformin, an antidiabetic drug, is a potential candidate for PD treatment and that it could prevent PD onset in T2DM model flies. This result supports antidiabetic drugs as promising PD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Chronic ethanol exposure can increase amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau in rodent models of Alzheimers-disease (AD)-like pathology, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, a moderate two-bottle choice drinking paradigm was used to identify how chronic ethanol exposure alters A{beta}-related pathology, metabolism, and behavior. Complementary in vivo microdialysis experiments were used to measure how acute ethanol directly modulates A{beta} in the hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF). Ethanol-exposed APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice showed increased brain atrophy and an increased number of amyloid plaques. Further analysis revealed that ethanol exposure led to a shift in the distribution of plaque size in the cortex and hippocampus. Ethanol-exposed mice developed a greater number of smaller plaques, potentially setting the stage for increased plaque proliferation in later life. Ethanol also induced changes in N-methyl-D-aspartate and {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor (NMDAR and GABAAR, respectively) expression, possibly reflecting changes in the excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance in the brain. Ethanol exposure also led to a diurnal shift in feeding behavior which was associated with changes in glucose homeostasis and glucose intolerance. Ethanol exposure also exacerbated alterations in the open-field test and deficits in nest-building behaviors in APP/PS1mice. Lastly, an acute dose of ethanol bidirectionally altered hippocampal ISF A{beta} levels - decreasing during the initial exposure and increasing during withdrawal. Acute ethanol exposure increased hippocampal ISF glucose levels, suggesting changes in cerebral glucose metabolism occur in response to ethanol. These experiments indicate that ethanol exacerbates an AD-like phenotype by altering A{beta} deposition, behavior, and metabolism. Here, even a moderate drinking paradigm culminates in an interaction between alcohol use and AD-related phenotypes with a potentiation of AD-related pathology, behavioral dysfunction, and metabolic impairment.\n\nHighlightsO_LIChronic ethanol exposure increases brain atrophy in APP/PS1 mice.\nC_LIO_LIChronic ethanol exposure increased the number of plaques in the brains of APP/PS1 mice.\nC_LIO_LIChronic ethanol exposure led to dysregulated metabolism in APP/PS1 mice.\nC_LIO_LIChronic ethanol exposure altered anxiety- and dementia-related behaviors in APP/PS1 mice.\nC_LIO_LIAcute ethanol exposure bidirectionally alters interstitial fluid (ISF) levels of amyloid-{beta} in APP/PS1 mice during exposure and withdrawal.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryNeuronal cell loss is a defining feature of Alzheimers disease (AD), but it remains unclear how neurons die and how this relates to other defining characteristics of the disease1. Existing in vivo AD models only partially recapitulate the neuropathology of AD with very mild or no neuronal cell loss. Here we demonstrate that human neurons xenografted in mouse brain exposed to amyloid pathology develop sarkosyl-insoluble tau filaments, positive Gallyas silver staining, release phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) into the blood, and display considerable neuronal cell loss, providing a model for the induction of full Tau pathology by simple exposure to amyloid pathology in AD. The alterations are specific to human neurons and contrast with the mild effects exhibited in mouse neurons. A core transcriptional program in the human neurons is characterized by strong upregulation of MEG3, a neuron-specific long noncoding RNA. MEG3 is also strongly upregulated in neurons from AD patients in situ. MEG3 expression alone is sufficient to induce necroptosis in human neurons in vitro. Orally administered small molecule receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase -1 and -3 inhibitors rescued the neuronal cell loss in this novel AD model. Thus, xenografted human neurons are uniquely sensitive to amyloid pathology, recapitulate all the defining neuropathological features of AD, and ultimately die by necroptosis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccumulated senescent cells are proposed to be one of the main drivers of age-related pathology through disruption of tissue structure and function. We recently proposed the Neuro-Immuno-Senescence Integrative Model (NISIM; Ask et al., 2018) which relates prefrontally modulated vagal tone and subsequent balance between vagal and sympathetic input to the spleen to inflammatory responses leading to generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative telomere damage. The NISIM is based on converging evidence and argues for the existence of a prefrontal cortex-autonomic nervous system-spleen (PAS) axis, suggesting that the inflammation that induces reactive oxygen species-generation is downstream of this axis.\n\nAimIn this study, we aim to assess inflammation as a mediator in the relationship between prefrontally modulated vagal tone and leukocyte telomere length to test the hypothesis that PAS axis dysregulation accelerates cellular aging. We also assess the relationship between a recently proposed index of vagal immunomodulation (vagal tone/inflammation ratio; NIM index; Gidron et al., 2018) and telomere length, and compare results between the NIM index and vagal tone as predictors of telomere length.\n\nMethodsThis study uses participant data from a large nationally representative longitudinal study since 1974 with a total of 45,000 Norwegian residents so far. A sub-sample of 1372 participants from which vagal tone, C Reactive Protein, and leukocyte telomere length could be obtained were included in the study. Relationships were analyzed with hierarchical multiple linear regression using either vagal tone and C Reactive Protein or the NIM index to predict telomere length. Sleeping problems, tobacco use status, alcohol use status, time since last meal, and symptoms of depression were included as control variables.\n\nResultsIn the mediation analysis, vagal tone was a significant positive predictor of telomere length, while C Reactive Protein was a significant negative predictor of telomere length. This relationship remained significant when individually controlling for some but not all confounding variables. The NIM index was a significant positive predictor of telomere length. This relationship remained significant when controlling for all confounding variables except one. In a reduced dataset excluding all participants where confounders were present, the NIM index remained a significant predictor of telomere length.\n\nConclusionThis is the first study suggesting that PAS axis activity is associated with telomere length thus supporting the NISIM. Results indicate that the NIM index is a more sensitive indicator of PAS axis activity than vagal tone and C Reactive Protein in isolation. Clinical relevance and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

The genus Puya (Bromeliaceae) lives throughout the Andes, including puna and the paramo ecosystems above 3500m. Here, we studied the life history and reproductive size thresholds in three species of Puya (P. raimondii, P. cryptantha and P. goudotiana): P. raimondii in the Bolivian puna, and P. cryptantha and P. goudotiana in the Colombian paramo. We collected data on threshold size at flowering and clonal reproduction. All three species were found to have a consistent minimum size at flowering, while only P. cryptantha demonstrated a minimum size for clonal reproduction. No such evidence was found for P. goudotiana. We also found a positive correlation between leaf length and fruit number for P. goudotiana and P. cryptantha. Our data supported that P. raimondii is fully semelparous and indicated that P. goudotiana and P. cryptantha may be semi-semelparous.",

    "abstract": "In Rugby a high proportion of catastrophic cervical spine injuries occur during tackling. In the injury prevention literature, there is still an open debate on the injury mechanisms related to such injuries, with hyperflexion and buckling being under scrutiny. The aims of this study were to determine the primary cervical spine injury mechanism during head-on rugby tackling, and evaluate the effect of tackling technique on cervical spine intervertebral loading. We conducted an in silico study to examine the dynamic response of the cervical spine under loading conditions representative of accidental head-on rugby tackles by using a subject-specific musculoskeletal model of a rugby player. The computer simulations were driven by experimental in vivo data of an academy rugby player tackling a punchbag, and in vitro data of head-first impacts using a dummy head. Results showed that: i) the earlier generation of high compression and anterior shear loads with low values of flexion moments provides evidence that hyperflexion is unlikely to be the primary injury mechanism in the sub-axial cervical spine (C3-C7) during central and posterior head impact locations; ii) a higher degree of neck flexion at impact poses the cervical spine in a more hazardous position. These findings provide objective evidence to inform injury prevention strategies or rugby law changes, with the final view of improving the safety of the game of rugby.",

    "abstract": "Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid neurotoxin that remains the most used insecticide worldwide. It persists in the environment long after the initial application resulting in chronic exposure to non-target insects. To accurately map the dose-dependent effects of these exposures across taxa, toxicological assays need to assess various modes of exposure across relevant indicator species. However, due to the difficulty of these experiments, contact bioassays are frequently used to quantify dose, and dipterans remain underrepresented. Here, we developed a novel naturalistic feeding bioassay to precisely measure imidacloprid ingestion and its toxicity for acute and chronic exposures in a dipteran pollinator, Eristalis tenax. Flies which ingested imidacloprid dosages lower than 12.1 ng/mg all showed consistent intake volumes and learned improved feeding efficiency over successive feeding sessions. In contrast, at doses of 12.1 ng/mg and higher flies had a rapid onset of severe locomotive impairment which prevented them from completing the feeding task. Neither probability of survival nor severe locomotive impairment were significantly higher than the control group until doses of 1.43 ng/mg or higher were reached. We were unable to measure a median lethal dose for acute exposure (72 hours) due to flies possessing a relatively high tolerance for imidacloprid. However, with chronic exposure (18 days), mortality went up and an LD50 of 0.41 ng/mg was estimated. Severe locomotive impairment tended to occur earlier and at lower dosages than lethality, with ED50s of 0.17 ng/mg and 7.82 ng/mg for acute and chronic exposure, respectively. Although the adult Eristalis is a honeybee mimic, it possesses a much higher tolerance to this toxin than its model. The similarity in the LD50 to other dipterans such as the fruitfly and the housefly suggests that there may be a phylogenetic component to pesticide tolerance that needs to be further investigated. The absence of obvious adverse effects at sublethal dosages also underscores a need to develop better tools for quantifying animal behaviour to evaluate the impact of insecticides on foraging efficiency in economically important species.",

    "abstract": "Interoception, or an awareness of the internal body state, guides agents in adaptive behavior by informing them of ongoing bodily signals, such as heart rate or energy status. However, it is still unclear whether the human brain represents the differences in the subjective experience of interoception differently. Hence, we directly compared the neural activation for cardiac (awareness related to heartbeats) and gastric (awareness related to the stomach) interoception in the same population (healthy human, N = 31). Participants were asked to focus on their heart and stomach sensations to be aware of interoception in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The results indicated that neural activation underlying gastric interoception encompassed larger brain regions, including the occipitotemporal visual cortices, bilateral primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral hippocampal regions. Cardiac interoception, however, selectively activated the right anterior insula extending to the frontal operculum more compared to gastric interoception. Moreover, our detailed analyses focusing on the insula, the most relevant region for interoception, revealed that the left dorsal middle insula encoded cardiac and gastric interoception in different activation patterns but not the posterior insula. Our results demonstrate that cardiac and gastric interoception have distinct neural substrates; in particular, the selective brain activation may reflect differences in the functional roles of cardiac and gastric interoception.\n\nSignificance statementInteroception, subjective senses that arise from within the body, plays a critical role in maintaining adaptive behavior by informing of the ongoing bodily states, such as heart rate and energy status. Although interoception has various characteristics depending on its source signals, previous neuroimaging studies have extensively used cardiac interoception (senses related to heartbeats), making it unclear whether the brain differently encodes diverse experiences of interoception. Here, we demonstrate that cardiac interoception and gastric interoception (senses related to the stomach) have distinct neural substrates by combining mass-univariate analysis with multivoxel pattern analysis for fMRI data. Our findings suggest that the selective brain activation may reflect differences in the functional roles of cardiac and gastric interoception.",

This promises to have far-reaching implications for the increased applicability of VR across scientific, industrial and clinical settings. However, so far, there is little data regarding the accuracy, delay and overall performance of these types of hand-tracking systems. Here we present a novel methodological framework which can be easily applied to measure these systems absolute positional error, temporal delay and finger joint-angle accuracy. We used this framework to evaluate the Meta Quest 2 hand-tracking system. Our results showed an average fingertip positional error of 1.1cm, an average finger joint angle error of 9.6o and an average temporal delay of 38.0ms. Finally, a novel approach was developed to correct for these positional errors based on a lens distortion model. This methodological framework provides a powerful tool to ensure the reliability and validity of data originating from VR-based, marker-less hand-tracking systems.",

    "abstract": "Of the sources of noise which affect BOLD fMRI, respiration and cardiac fluctuations are responsible for the largest part of the variance, particularly at high and ultra-high field. Existing approaches to removing physiological noise either use external recordings, which can be unwieldy and unreliable, or attempt to identify physiological noise from the magnitude fMRI data. Data-driven approaches are limited by sensitivity, temporal aliasing and the need for user interaction. In the light of the sensitivity of the phase of the MR signal to local changes in the field stemming from physiological processes, we have developed an unsupervised physiological noise correction method which uses the information carried in both the phase and the magnitude of EPI data. Our technique, Physiological Regressor Estimation from Phase and mAgnItude, sub-tR (PREPAIR) derives time series signals which are sampled at the slice TR from both phase and magnitude images. It allows physiological noise to be captured without aliasing, and efficiently removes other sources of signal fluctuations which are not related to physiology, prior to regressor estimation. We demonstrate that the physiological signal time courses identified with PREPAIR not only agree well with those from external devices, but also retrieve challenging cardiac dynamics. The removal of physiological noise was as effective as that achieved with the most commonly used approach based on external recordings, RETROICOR. In comparison with widely used physiological noise correction tools which do not use external signals, PESTICA and FIX, PREPAIR removed more respiratory and cardiac noise and achieved a larger increase in tSNR at both 3 T and 7 T.",

We reveal that repeated ecological and morphological diversification along a common environmental axis is associated with both genome-wide allele frequency shifts and a specific, larger effect, locus, associated with the gene edar. Additionally, we highlight the role of introgression between species from different lake-systems in facilitating the evolution and persistence of species with unique phenotypic combinations and ecology.

    "abstract": "Structural and functional brain networks are modular. Canonical functional systems, such as the default mode network, are well-known modules of the human brain and have been implicated in a large number of cognitive, behavioral and clinical processes. However, modules delineated in structural brain networks inferred from tractography generally do not recapitulate canonical functional systems. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that functional connectivity between regions in the same systems is not always underpinned by anatomical connections. As such, direct structural connectivity alone would be insufficient to characterize the functional modular organization of the brain. Here, we demonstrate that augmenting structural brain networks with models of indirect (polysynaptic) communication unveils a modular network architecture that more closely resembles the brains established functional systems. We find that diffusion models of polysynaptic connectivity, particularly communicability, narrow the gap between the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks by 20-60%, whereas routing models based on single efficient paths do not improve mesoscopic structure-function correspondence. This suggests that functional modules emerge from the constraints imposed by local network structure that facilitates diffusive neural communication. Our work establishes the importance of modeling polysynaptic communication to understand the structural basis of functional systems.",

    "abstract": "Salt pans or playas, which are saline-rich springs surrounded by halite evaporates in arid environments, have played an essential role in landscape erosion during the formation of the Namib Desert and are numerous in its central region. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomics to investigate the phylogenetic and functional capacities of the microbial communities from two salt pans (namely, Eisefeld and Hosabes) located in the Central Namib Desert, located in Southwest Africa. We studied the source and sink sediment mat communities of the saline streams, as well as those from two halites (crystallized structures on the stream margins). The microbial assemblages and potential functions were distinct in both niches. Independently from their localization (Eisfeld vs Hosabes and source vs sink), the sediment mat communities were dominated by members of the Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria classes, while halites were Archaea-dominated and also contained high abundances of the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter sp. (phylum Bacteroidota). Photoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy were the principal lifestyles in both niches, with halite communities having a reduced diversity of metabolic pathways. Intense microbial-virus interactions in both niches were implied by the widespread detection of CRISPR-Cas defense systems. We identified a putatively novel clade of type II CRISPR-Cas systems, as well as novel candidate viral lineages of the class Caudoviricetes and of Halobacteriales-infecting haloviruses. Putative gene transfer agent-like sequences within the Alphaproteobacteria were identified in the sediment mat communities. These horizontal gene transfer elements have the potential to drive genome plasticity and evolution of the Alphaproteobacteria in the Namib Desert salt pan microbiomes.\n\nImportanceThe hyperarid Namib Desert is one of the oldest deserts on Earth. It contains multiple clusters of playas which are saline-rich springs surrounded by halite evaporites. Playas are of great ecological importance and their indigenous (poly)extremophilic microorganisms are potentially involved in the precipitation of minerals such as carbonates and sulfates and have been of great biotechnological importance. While there has been a considerable amount of microbial ecology research preformed on various Namib Desert edaphic microbiomes, little is known about the microbial communities inhabiting its multiple playas. In this work, we therefore provide a comprehensive taxonomic and functional potential characterization of the microbial, including viral, communities of sediment mats and halites from two distant Namib Desert, contributing towards a better understanding of the ecology of this biome.",

Here, we advocate for a flexible and transparent approach to selecting protected areas based on multiple objectives, and illustrate this with a decision support tool on a global scale. The tool allows weighting and prioritization of different conservation objectives according to user-specified preferences, as well as real-time comparison of the selected areas that result from such different priorities. We apply the tool across 1347 terrestrial PAs and highlight frequent trade-offs among different objectives, e.g., between species protection and ecosystem integrity. Outputs indicate that decision makers frequently face trade-offs among conflicting objectives. Nevertheless, we show that transparent decision-support tools can reveal synergies and trade-offs associated with PA selection, thereby helping to illuminate and resolve land-use conflicts embedded in divergent societal and political demands and values.",

However, as mostly performed in a monoculture of tumor cells, these assays disregard modulatory effects of the in vivo microenvironment. It is an open question whether and to what extent coculture with bone marrow stromal cells could improve the biological relevance of drug testing assays over monoculture. Here, we measured ex vivo sensitivity of 108 primary blood cancer samples to 50 drugs in monoculture and in coculture with bone marrow stromal cells. Stromal coculture conferred resistance to 52 % of compounds in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and to 36% of compounds in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including chemotherapeutics, BCR inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors and BET inhibitors. While most of the remaining drugs were similarly effective in mono- and coculture, only the JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and tofacitinib exhibited increased efficacy in AML and CLL stromal coculture. We further confirmed the importance of JAK-STAT signaling for stroma-mediated resistance by showing that stromal cells induce phosphorylation of STAT3 in CLL cells. We genetically characterized the 108 cancer samples and found that drug-gene associations agreed well between mono- and coculture. Overall, effect sizes were lower in coculture, thus more drug-gene associations were detected in monoculture than in coculture. Our results suggest a two-step strategy for drug perturbation testing, with large-scale screening performed in monoculture, followed by focused evaluation of potential stroma-mediated resistances in coculture.",

    "abstract": "Increased serial sarcomere number (SSN) has been observed in rats via downhill running training due to the emphasis on active lengthening contractions; however, little is known about the influence on dynamic contractile function. Therefore, we employed 4 weeks of weighted downhill running training in rats, then assessed soleus SSN and work loop performance. We hypothesized trained rats would produce greater net work output during faster, higher-strain work loops due to a greater SSN. Thirty-one Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to a control or training group. Weight was added during downhill running via a custom-made vest, progressing from 5-15% body mass. Following sacrifice, the soleus was dissected, and a force-length relationship was constructed. Work loops (active shortening followed by passive lengthening) were then performed about optimal muscle length (LO) at 1.5-3-Hz cycle frequencies and 1-7-mm strains to assess net work output. Muscles were then fixed in formalin at LO. Fascicle lengths and sarcomere lengths were measured and used to calculate SSN. Intramuscular collagen content and crosslinking were quantified via a hydroxyproline content and pepsin-solubility assay. Trained rats had longer fascicle lengths (+13%), greater SSN (+8%), greater specific active forces (+50%), and lower passive forces (-45-62%) than controls (P<0.05). There were no differences in collagen parameters (P>0.05). Net work output was greater (+101-424%) in trained than control rats for the 1.5-Hz loops at 1, 3, and 5-mm strains (P<0.05) and showed relationships with fascicle length (R2=0.14-0.24, P<0.05).

    "abstract": "Integrating physiology with structural insights of the same neuronal circuit provides a unique approach to understanding how the mammalian brain computes information. However, combining the techniques that provide both streams of data represents an experimental challenge. When studying glomerular column circuits in the mouse olfactory bulb, this approach involves e.g. recording the neuronal activity with in vivo 2-photon (2P) calcium imaging, retrieving the circuit structure with synchrotron X-ray computed tomography with propagation-based phase contrast (SXRT) and/or serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) and correlating these datasets. Sample preparation and dataset correlation are two key bottlenecks in this correlative workflow. Here, we first quantify the occurrence of different artefacts when staining tissue slices with heavy metals to generate X-ray or electron contrast. We report improvements in the staining procedure, ultimately achieving perfect staining in [~]67% of the 0.6 mm thick olfactory bulb slices that were previously imaged in vivo with 2P. Secondly, we characterise the accuracy of the spatial correlation between functional and structural datasets. We demonstrate that direct, single-cell precise correlation between in vivo 2P and SXRT tissue volumes is possible and as reliable as correlating between 2P and SBEM. Altogether, these results pave the way for experiments that require retrieving physiology, circuit structure and synaptic signatures in targeted regions. These correlative function-structure studies will bring a more complete understanding of mammalian olfactory processing across length scales and time.",

    "abstract": "Heat stroke is a life-threatening illness and is related to systematic inflammation-induced multiple organ dysfunction. Available evidence indicates that the severity of the systematic inflammatory response in heat stroke may be related to the changes in immune regulation brought by heat acclimation. However, the mechanisms of heat acclimation are still unclear. Here, we assessed the differences in immunocyte subsets in the spleen and lymph nodes of heat-acclimated and unacclimated mice. A higher frequency of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs was observed in heat-acclimated mice. Our results indicated that the improved heat tolerance exhibited during acute heat stress exposure was related to an increased number of Tregs. In heat-acclimated mice, an increase in the number of Tregs was able to mitigate the recruitment of neutrophils, inhibit the activation of neutrophils, and suppress the severity of acute inflammation. Increased differentiation and development of Tregs in peripheral immune organs in heat-acclimated mice might stem from enhanced expression of Foxp3 and PD-L1. Our results strongly suggest that the regulatory function of increased Tregs on neutrophils may be regulated through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. The anti-inflammatory effects of Tregs have never been studied in the context of heat stress-induced systemic inflammation. Thus, our results on immunoregulation involving Tregs in heat-acclimated mice might be significant for devising a potential treatment for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and heatstroke.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is one of the most prominent threats to modern medicine. In the latest World Health Organization list of bacterial pathogens that urgently require new antibiotics, nine out of 12 are Gram-negative, with four being of  Critical Priority. One crucial barrier restricting antibiotic efficacy against Gram-negative bacteria is their unique cell envelope. While fatty acids are a shared constituent of all structural membrane lipids, their biosynthesis pathway in bacteria is distinct from eukaryotes making it an attractive target for new antibiotic development that remains less explored. Here, we interrogated the redundant components of the bacterial Type II Fatty Acid Synthesis (FAS II) pathway, showing that disrupting FAS II homeostasis in Escherichia coli through deletion of the fabH gene damages the cell envelope of antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic resistant clinical isolates. The fabH gene encodes the {beta}-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase III (KAS III), which catalyzes the initial condensation reactions during fatty acid biosynthesis. We show that fabH null mutation potentiated the killing of multi-drug resistant E. coli by a broad panel of previously ineffective antibiotics, despite the presence of relevant antibiotic resistance determinants, for example, carbapenemase kpc2. Enhanced antibiotic sensitivity was additionally demonstrated in the context of eradicating established biofilms and treating established human cell infection in vitro. Our findings showcase the potential of FabH as a promising target that could be further explored in the development of therapies that may repurpose currently ineffective antibiotics or rescue failing last-resort antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens.\n\nIMPORTANCEGram-negative pathogens are a major concern for global public health due to increasing rates of antibiotic resistance and the lack of new drugs. A major contributing factor towards antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is their formidable outer membrane, which acts as a permeability barrier preventing many biologically active antimicrobials from reaching the intracellular targets and thus limiting their efficacy. Fatty acids are the fundamental building blocks of structural membrane lipids and their synthesis constitutes an attractive antimicrobial target as it follows distinct pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Herein, we identified a component of fatty acid synthesis, FabH, as a  gate-keeper of outer membrane barrier function. Without FabH, Gram-negative bacteria become susceptible to otherwise impermeable antibiotics and are re-sensitised to killing by last-resort antibiotics. This study supports FabH as a promising target for inhibition in future antimicrobial therapies.",

    "abstract": "Microglia activation causes neuroinflammation, which is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders, brain injury, and aging. Ladostigil, a bifunctional reagent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, reduced microglial activation and enhanced brain functioning in elderly rats. In this study, we studied SH-SY5Y, a human neuroblastoma cell line, and tested viability in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and Sin1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine), which generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Both stressors caused significant apoptosis and necrotic cell death that was attenuated by ladostigil. Our results from RNA-seq experiments show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) account for 30% of all transcripts in SH-SY5Y cells treated with Sin1 for 24 hours. Altogether, we identify 94 differently expressed lncRNAs in the presence of Sin1, including MALAT1, a highly expressed lncRNA with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions. Additional activities of Sin-1 upregulated lncRNAs include redox homeostasis (e.g., MIAT, GABPB1-AS1), energy metabolism (HAND2-AS1), and neurodegeneration (e.g., MIAT, GABPB1-AS1, NEAT1). Four lncRNAs implicated as enhancers were significantly upregulated in cells exposed to Sin1 and ladostigil. Finally, we show that H2O2 and Sin1 increased the expression of DJ-1, a redox sensor and modulator of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor 2). Nrf2 (NFE2L2 gene) is a major transcription factor regulating antioxidant genes. In the presence of ladostigil, DJ-1 expression is restored to its baseline. The mechanisms governing SH-SY5Y cell survival and homeostasis are highlighted by the beneficial role of ladostigil in the crosstalk involving Nrf2, antioxidant transcription factor DJ-1, and lncRNAs. Stress-dependent induction of lncRNAs represents an underappreciated regulatory level that contributes to cellular homeostasis and the capacity of SH-SY5Y to cope with oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens show high levels of standing genetic diversity, but the influence of this diversity on the evolution of antibiotic resistance remains unclear. Here we address this problem in the context of colistin, a  last line of defense antibiotic. Using experimental evolution, we show that a plasmid carrying the MCR-1 colistin resistance gene dramatically increases the ability of E. coli populations to evolve high-level colistin resistance by acquiring mutations in lpxC, an essential chromosomal gene involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Crucially, lpxC mutations increase colistin resistance in the presence of the MCR-1 gene, but decrease the resistance of wild-type cells, revealing positive sign epistasis for antibiotic resistance. Analysis of public genomic datasets shows that lpxC polymorphisms are common in pathogenic E. coli carrying MCR-1, highlighting the clinical relevance of this interaction. Importantly, lpxC diversity is high in pathogenic E. coli from regions with no history of MCR-1 acquisition, suggesting that pre-existing lpxC polymorphisms have potentiated the evolution of high-level colistin resistance by MCR-1 acquisition. More broadly, these findings highlight the importance of standing genetic variation and plasmid/chromosomal interactions in the evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical constraints on the admissible amino acids at specific sites in proteins leads to heterogeneity of the amino acid substitution process over sites in alignments. It is well known that phylogenetic models of protein sequence evolution that do not account for site heterogeneity are prone to long-branch attraction (LBA) artifacts. Profile mixture models were developed to model heterogeneity of preferred amino acids at sites via a finite distribution of site classes each with a distinct set of equilibrium amino acid frequencies. However, it is unknown whether the large number of parameters in such models associated with the many amino acid frequency classes can adversely affect tree topology estimates because of over-parameterization. Here we demonstrate theoretically that for long sequences, over-parameterization does not create problems for estimation with profile mixture models. Under mild conditions, tree, amino acid frequencies and other model parameters converge to true values as sequence length increases, even when there are large numbers of components in the frequency profile distributions. Because large sample theory does not necessarily imply good behavior for shorter alignments we explore performance of these models with short alignments simulated with tree topologies that are prone to LBA artifacts. We find that over-parameterization is not a problem for complex profile mixture models even when there are many amino acid frequency classes. In fact, simple models with few site classes behave poorly. Interestingly, we also found that misspecification of the amino acid frequency classes does not lead to increased LBA artifacts as long as the estimated cumulative distribution function of the amino acid frequencies at sites adequately approximates the true one. In contrast, misspecification of the amino acid exchangeability rates can severely negatively affect parameter estimation. Finally, we explore the effects of including in the profile mixture model an additional  F-class representing the overall frequencies of amino acids in the data set. Surprisingly, the F-class does not help parameter estimation significantly, and can decrease the probability of correct tree estimation, depending on the scenario, even though it tends to improve likelihood scores.",

    "abstract": "Mitosis leads to a global downregulation of transcription that then needs to be efficiently restored. In somatic cells, this is mediated by a transient hyper-active state that first leads to the reactivation of genes necessary to rebuild the interphasic cell and then of those executing specific cell functions. Here, we hypothesized that cells displaying rapid cell cycles may display accelerated gene reactivation dynamics. To test this, we focused on mouse Embryonic Stem (ES) cells, which have a short cell cycle and spend a minor time in G1. Compared to previous studies, we observed a uniquely fast global reactivation, which displays little specificity towards housekeeping versus cell identity genes. Such lack of specificity may enable the restoration of the entirety of regulatory functions before the onset of DNA replication. Genes displaying the fastest reactivation dynamics are associated with binding of CTCF, a transcription factor that largely maintains binding to its targets on DNA during mitosis. Nevertheless, we show that the post-mitotic global burst is robust and largely insensitive to CTCF depletion. There are, however, around 350 genes that respond to CTCF depletion rapidly after mitotic exit. Remarkably, these are characterised by promoter-proximal mitotic bookmarking by CTCF. We propose that the structure of the cell cycle imposes distinct constrains to post-mitotic gene reactivation dynamics in different cell types, via mechanisms that are yet to be identified but that can be modulated by mitotic bookmarking factors.",

    "abstract": "HBO1 (HAT bound to ORC), a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), was initially identified as a binding partner of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that acetylates free histone H3, H4, and nucleosomal H3. It functions as a quaternary complex with the BRPF (BRPF1/2/3) scaffolding protein and two accessory proteins, ING4/5 and Eaf6. BRPF2 interaction with HBO1 has been shown to be important for regulating H3K14 acetylation during embryonic development. However, how the BRPF2 directs the HBO1 HAT complex to chromatin to regulate its HAT activity towards nucleosomal substrates remains unclear. Our findings reveal novel interacting partners of the BRPF2 bromodomain that recognizes different acetyllysine residues on the N-terminus of histone H4, H3, and H2A and preferentially binds to H4K5ac, H4K8ac, and H4K5acK12ac modifications. Further, mutational analysis of BRPF2 bromodomain coupled with ITC binding and pull-down assays on the histone substrates identified critical residues responsible for acetyllysine binding. Moreover, the BRPF2 bromodomain could enrich H4K5ac mark-bearing mononucleosomes compared to other acetylated H4 marks. Consistent with this, ChIP-seq analysis revealed that BRPF2 strongly co-localizes with HBO1 at histone H4K5ac and H4K8ac marks near the TSS in the genome. Together, our study provides novel insights into how the histone binding function of the BRPF2 bromodomain directs the recruitment of the HBO1 HAT complex to chromatin to regulate gene expression.",

Phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases (PTPs) are structurally diverse enzymes increasingly recognized having fundamental role in cellular processes including effects on metabolism, cell proliferation and differentiation. This study presents comparative homology modeling of low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (PTPs) from Drosophila melanogaster (Dr-PTPs) and their complexation with potent inhibitor HEPES. The 3D structure was predicted based on sequence homology with bovine heart low molecular weight PTPs (Bh-PTPs). The sequence homology is approximately 50% identical to each other and to low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in other species. Comparison of the 3D structures of Bh-PTPs and Dr-PTPs (primo-2) reveals a remarkable similarity having a four stranded central parallel {beta} sheet with flanking  helices on both sides, showing two right-handed {beta}--{beta} motifs. The inhibitor shows similar binding features as seen in other PTPs. The study also highlights the key catalytic residues important for target recognition and PTPs activation. The structure guided studies of both proteins clearly reveal a common mechanism of action, inhibitor binding at the active site and will expected to contribute towards the basic understanding of functional association of this enzyme with other molecules.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the study of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) given the substantial body of evidence that implicates them in many human diseases. Although their genomic characterization presents numerous technical challenges, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has shown potential to detect HERV insertions and their polymorphisms in humans, and a number of computational tools to detect them in short-read NGS data exist. In order to design optimal analysis pipelines, an independent evaluation of the currently available tools is required. We evaluated the performance of a set of such tools using a variety of experimental designs and types of NGS datasets. These included 50 human short read whole-genome sequencing samples, matching long and short read NGS data, and simulated short-read NGS data. Our results highlight the performance variability of the tools across the datasets and suggest that different tools might be suitable for different study designs. Using multiple tools and a consensus approach is advisable if computationally feasible and wet-lab validation via PCR is advisable where biological samples are available.",

    "abstract": "The toxic gain of function of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) associated with the neurodegenerative disease - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is believed to occur via misfolding and/or aggregation. SOD1 is also associated with stress granules (SGs) which are a type of membraneless organelle believed to form via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of several proteins containing low-complexity, disordered regions. Using a combination of experiments and computer simulations, we report here that structural disorder in two loop regions of SOD1 induced by the absence of metal cofactor - Zn, triggers its LLPS. The phase-separated droplets give rise to aggregates which eventually form toxic amyloids upon prolonged incubation. The addition of exogenous Zn to immature, metal-free SOD1 and the severe ALS mutant - I113T, stabilized the loops and restored the folded structure, thereby inhibiting LLPS and subsequent aggregation. In contrast, the Zn-induced inhibition of LLPS and aggregation was found to be partial in the case of another severe ALS-associated mutant - G85R, which exhibits reduced Zn-binding. Moreover, a less-severe ALS mutant - G37R with perturbed Cu binding does not undergo LLPS. In conclusion, our work establishes a role for Zn-dependent modulation of SOD1 disorder and LLPS as a precursor phenomenon which may lead to the formation of toxic amyloids associated with ALS.\n\nSignificance StatementThe formation of membraneless organelles such as stress granules (SGs) is believed to occur through the process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and involves numerous proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions. Whether SOD1, which is also associated with SGs and whose aggregation is associated with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), can independently undergo LLPS, is not known. SOD1 is a metalloenzyme which is stabilized by the metal co-factor - Zn. In this work, we utilize experimental and simulation techniques to highlight the modulation of SOD1 LLPS propensity in a Zn-dependent manner due to underlying conformational transitions between folded and partially disordered states. Our work establishes a link between SOD1 LLPS and aggregation, which is relevant to ALS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to treatment is a major clinical problem and a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Understanding the biological basis of resistance acquisition is of utmost importance to improve the clinical management of cancer patients. NGS analysis of human lung cancer (LC) tumors from patients that relapsed after treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), revealed that the p.T790M resistance mutation is not present in all the relapsing tumor cells, suggesting that LC cells can become resistant even if not carrying the p.T790M mutation. Using in vitro treatments with conditioned medium (CM) and in vivo co-inoculation experiments, we show that LC cells sensitive to EGFR-TKIs (S cells) acquire resistance faster when treated with CM from LC cells resistant to EGFR-TKIs (R cells) or when co-inoculated with R cells in opposite flanks of the same animal. Importantly, we show that acquisition of resistance is not due to the emergence of subpopulations of cancer cells with new resistance mutations. Using transcriptomics, we show that acquisition of resistance is associated with upregulation of genes involved in endocytosis, namely caveolins CAV1 and CAV2. These findings were validated in human clinical samples, where an increase in CAV1 and CAV2 expression was associated with tumor relapse after treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Our results suggest that acquisition of resistance to targeted therapies results from the combined effect of selection of cells harboring specific resistance mutations and horizontal transfer of the resistance phenotype. These findings may pave the way to bring intercellular communication into the realm of cancer treatment.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryResistance to EGFR inhibitors is transferred horizontally between lung cancer cells and is associated with gain of expression of caveolins.",

    "abstract": "Rising temperatures due to climate change threaten agricultural crop productivity. As a cool-season crop wheat is heat sensitive, but often exposed to high temperatures during cultivation. In the current study, a bread wheat panel of spring wheat genotypes, including putatively heat-tolerant Australian and CIMMYT genotypes, was exposed to a 5-day mild (34{degrees}C/28{degrees}C, day/night) or extreme (37{degrees}C/27{degrees}C) heat stress during the sensitive pollen developmental stage. Worsening effects on anther morphology were observed as heat stress increased from mild to extreme. Even under mild heat a significant decrease in pollen viability and grain number per spike from primary spike was observed compared with the control (21{degrees}C/15{degrees}C), with Sunstar and two CIMMYT breeding lines performing well. A heat-specific positive correlation between the two traits indicates the important role of pollen fertility for grain setting. Interestingly, both mild and extreme heat induced development of new tillers after the heat stress, providing an alternative sink for accumulated photosynthates and significantly contributing to the final yield. Measurements of flag leaf maximum potential quantum efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm) showed an initial inhibition after the heat treatment, followed by a full recovery within a few days. Despite this, model fitting using chlorophyll SPAD measurements showed an earlier onset or faster senescence rate under heat stress. The data presented here provide interesting entry points for further research into pollen fertility, tillering dynamics and leaf senescence under heat. The identified tolerant wheat genotypes can be used to dissect the underlying mechanisms and breed climate-resilient wheat.",

    "abstract": "Previously, sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) was developed as a vector for transient expression of heterologous genes in Zea mays (maize). Here we show that SCMV can also be applied for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of endogenous maize genes. Comparison of sense and antisense VIGS constructs targeting maize PDS (phytoene desaturase) showed that antisense constructs resulted in a greater reduction in gene expression. In a time course of gene expression after infection with VIGS constructs targeting PDS, Les22 (Lesion mimic 22), and Ij1 (Iodent japonica1), efficient expression silencing was observed two, three, and four weeks after infection with SCMV. However, at week five, expression of Les22 and Ij1 was no longer significantly reduced compared to control plants. The defense signaling molecule jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile) can be inactivated by 12C-hydroxylation and hydrolysis, and knockout of these genes leads to increased herbivore resistance. JA-Ile hydroxylases and hydrolases have been investigated in Arabidopsis, rice, and Nicotiana attenuata. To determine whether the maize homologs of these genes function in plant defense, we silenced expression of ZmCYP94B1 (predicted JA-Ile hydroxylase) and ZmJIH1 (predicted JA-Ile hydrolase) by VIGS with SCMV. Although ZmCYP94B1 and ZmJIH1gene expression silencing increased resistance to Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm), Schistocerca americana (American birdwing grasshopper), and Rhopalosiphum maidis (corn leaf aphid), there was no additive effect from silencing the expression of both genes. Further work will be required to determine the more precise functions of these enzymes in regulating maize defenses.",

    "abstract": "During Hedgehog signaling, the ciliary levels of Ptch1 and Smo are regulated by pathway activity. At the basal state, Ptch1 localizes to cilia and prevents the ciliary accumulation and activation of Smo. Upon stimulation with Hedgehog ligand, Ptch1 exits cilia and relieves the inhibition of Smo. Uninhibited Smo concentrates in cilia, becomes activated, and activates the downstream steps of the pathway. Loss of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Arih2 elevates the cellular level of Smo, causes Smo to inappropriately localize to cilia at the at the basal state, and elevates basal expression of Hedgehog responsive genes. Mice express two isoforms of Arih2 with different N-termini, but neither isoform localizes to cilia. Instead, Arih2 is found in the nucleus and Arih2{beta} is found on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum. Re-expression of endoplasmic reticulum-localized Arih2{beta}, but not nuclear-localized Arih2 returns the cellular Smo levels back to normal and rescues the ciliary Smo accumulation phenotype. When Arih2{beta} is missing, protein aggregates accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and the unfolded protein response is activated. Inhibitor studies suggest that Arih2{beta} functions to mark excess or misfolded Smo for degradation by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. When Arih2{beta} is defective, excess Smo, possibly misfolded, is delivered to the cell surface and cilium where it interferes with pathway regulation. These findings add another level of complexity to the Hedgehog pathway.",

    "abstract": "Impaired development and maintenance of the Schlemms Canal (SC) is associated with perturbed aqueous humor outflow regulation and glaucoma progression. Key molecular mechanisms, such as ANGPT/TIE2, PROX1, and VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 regulate SC development and maintenance, but mechanisms of paracrine signaling from neighboring tissues, including the trabecular meshwork (TM) are poorly understood. Here, we show Foxc2 is critical within the neural crest (NC)-derived TM and SC endothelium for development of the aqueous humor outflow pathway. In mice, NC- specific deletion of Foxc2 results in abnormal anterior eye segment development, including impaired SC morphogenesis and functional maintenance, loss of SC identity, and impaired maintenance of intraocular pressure (IOP). Visible light optical coherence tomography angiography analysis also demonstrated functional impairment of the SC in response to changes in IOP in NC-Foxc2-/- mice, suggesting increased TM stiffness. Utilization of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis then identified that this phenotype is predominately characterized by transcriptional changes associated with extracellular matrix organization and stiffness in TM-associated cell clusters, including increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, which can generate soluble TIE2 that acts as an ANGPT trap. As FOXC2 is also critically involved in development of the lymphatic vasculature in other tissues, we also show that endothelial-specific deletion of Foxc2 resulted in impaired SC morphogenesis due to loss of TIE2 expression, which was rescued by deletion of the TIE2 phosphatase VE-PTP. Thus, NC-Foxc2 is critical for development of the TM, and both NC- and endothelial-Foxc2 are key for maintenance of SC identity and its morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how crops adapt to specific environmental conditions is becoming increasingly important in the face of accelerating climate change, but the genetics of local adaptation remain little understood for many crops. Landscape genomics can reveal patterns of genetic variation that indicate adaptive diversification during crop evolution and dispersal. Here, we examine genetic differentiation and association signatures with environmental gradients in soybean (Glycine max) germplasm groups from China that were inferred from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection (N = 17,019 accessions) based on population structure and passport information. We recover genes previously known to be involved in soybean environmental adaptation and report numerous new candidate genes in selection signatures implicated by genomic resources such as the genome annotation and gene expression datasets to function in flowering regulation, photoperiodism and stress reaction cascades. Linkage disequilibrium network analysis suggested functional relationships between genomic regions with selection signatures, consistent with the polygenic nature of environmental adaptation. We tested whether haplotypes associated with environmental adaptation in China were present in 843 North American and 160 European soybean cultivars and found that haplotypes in major genes for early maturity have been selected during breeding, but also that a large number of haplotypes exhibiting putative adaptive variation for cold regions at high latitudes are underrepresented in modern cultivars. Our results demonstrate the value of landscape genomics analysis in genebank germplasm as a starting point for the study of crop environmental adaptation and have the potential to inform future research efforts focused on improved soybean adaptation. Functional validation of candidate genes will support understanding of their adaptive roles and likely enable the transfer of beneficial adaptive variation into modern breeding germplasm.",

Our lab previously identified Keratinocyte-associated protein 3, Krtcap3, as a candidate gene for adiposity where increased expression of Krtcap3 correlated with decreased fat mass. Here we seek to confirm that Krtcap3 expression affects adiposity traits.\n\nMethodsWe developed an in vivo whole-body Krtcap3 knock-out (KO) rat model. Wild-type (WT) and KO rats were placed onto a high-fat or low-fat diet at six weeks of age and were maintained on diet for 13 weeks, followed by assessments of metabolic health. We hypothesized that Krtcap3-KO rats will have increased adiposity and a worsened metabolic phenotype relative to WT.\n\nResultsWe found that KO male and female rats have significantly increased body weight versus WT. KO females ate more, had more fat mass, but were also more insulin sensitive than WT. Alternatively, KO males weighed more and were more insulin resistant than WT, with no differences in eating or fat mass.\n\nConclusionsThis study validates Krtcap3 in body weight regulation and demonstrates sex-specific effects on food intake, adiposity, and insulin sensitivity. Future studies will investigate how Krtcap3 is acting and seek to better understand these sex differences.\n\nStudy Importance QuestionsWhat is already known about this subject?

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, the human reference genome has undergone multiple updates as we complete a linear representation of our genome. There are two versions of human references currently used in the biomedical literature, GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38, and conversions between these versions are critical for quality control, imputation, and association analysis. In the present study we show that genomic coordinates for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in regions inverted between different builds of the reference genome are erroneously converted by the TOPMed imputation server. Depending on the array type, we estimate the inappropriate conversions of variant coordinates would occur in about 2-5 Mb of the genome. Independent of the imputation server, however, in-house conversions of variant coordinates are routine yet impact of mapped variants to these inverted regions and its downstream analytical consequences are underrecognized. We observed that errors for palindromic variants in these inverted regions cannot be detected by standard quality control procedures and destabilize the local haplotype structure, leading to loss of imputation accuracy and power in association analyses. Though only a small proportion of the genome is affected, we show that these regions include important disease susceptibility variants that would be lost due to poor imputation. For example, we show that a known locus associated with prostate cancer on chr10 would have its association P-value drop from 2.86x10-7 to 0.0011 in a case-control analysis of 20,286 Africans and African Americans (10,643 cases and 9,643 controls). We devise a straight-forward heuristic based on the popular tool liftOver that can easily detect and correct these variants in the inverted regions between genome builds to locally improve imputation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to investigate a genome at the cellular level with unprecedented resolution. An organism consists of a heterogeneous collection of cell types, each of which plays a distinct role in various biological processes. Hence, the first step of scRNA-seq data analysis is often to distinguish cell types so they can be investigated separately. Researchers have recently developed several automated cell type annotation tools, requiring neither biological knowledge nor subjective human decisions. Dropout is a crucial characteristic of scRNA-seq data widely used in differential expression analysis. However, dropout information is not explicitly used by any current cell annotation method. Fully utilizing dropout information for cell type annotation motivated this work.\n\nResultsWe present scAnnotate, a cell annotation tool that fully utilizes dropout information. We model every genes marginal distribution using a mixture model, which describes both the dropout proportion and the distribution of the non-dropout expression levels. Then, using an ensemble machine learning approach, we combine the mixture models of all genes into a single model for cell-type annotation. This combining approach can avoid estimating numerous parameters in the high-dimensional joint distribution of all genes. Using fourteen real scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate that scAnnotate is competitive against nine existing annotation methods. Furthermore, because of its distinct modelling strategy, scAnnotates misclassified cells are very different from competitor methods. This suggests using scAnnotate together with other methods could further improve annotation accuracy.\n\nAvailabilityWe implemented scAnnotate as an R package and made it publicly available from CRAN.\n\nContactXuekui Zhang: xuekui@uvic.ca and Li Xing: li.xing@math.usask.ca",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of E. coli consists of thousands of interactions between regulators and DNA sequences. Inherently the DNA sequence is the primary determinant of the TRN; however, it is well established that the presence of a DNA binding motif does not guarantee a functional regulatory protein binding site. Thus, the extent to which the TRN architecture can be predicted by the genome DNA sequence alone remains unclear. Here, we developed machine learning models that predict the TRN structure of E. coli based on genome sequence. Models were constructed successfully (cross-validation AUROC >= 0.8) for 84% (57/68) of valid E. coli regulons identified from top-down analysis of RNA-seq data. We found that: 1) While regulatory motif strength is the most important sequence feature for determining regulon membership, additional features such as DNA shape substantially influence membership; 2) complex regulons involving multiple interacting regulators could be unraveled by machine learning; 3) investigating regulons where initial ML models failed revealed new regulator-specific sequence features that improved model accuracy. Finally, while regulon structure can appear to be variable across estimation methods and strains, we found that strong regulatory sequence features underlie both the genes that appear most consistently in regulons across estimation methods as well as the core regulon genes in the Fur pan-regulon. This work develops a quantitative understanding of the sequence basis of the TRN and suggests a path towards computationally-guided control of transcriptional regulation for synthetic biology applications.",

    "abstract": "Variations in characteristics from one region (sub-population) to another is commonly observed in complex systems, such as glasses and a collection of cells. Such variations are manifestations of heterogeneity, whose spatial and temporal behavior is hard to describe theoretically. In the context of cancer, intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), characterized by cells with genetic and phenotypic variability that co-exist within a single tumor, is often the cause of ineffective therapy and recurrence of cancer. Next-generation sequencing, obtained by sampling multiple regions of a single tumor (multi-region sequencing, M-Seq), has vividly demonstrated the pervasive nature of ITH, raising the need for a theory that accounts for evolution of tumor heterogeneity. Here, we develop a statistical mechanical theory to quantify ITH, using the Hamming distance, between genetic mutations in distinct regions within a single tumor. An analytic expression for ITH, expressed in terms of cell division probability () and mutation probability (p), is validated using cellular-automaton type simulations. Application of the theory successfully captures ITH extracted from M-seq data in patients with exogenous cancers (melanoma and lung). The theory, based on punctuated evolution at the early stages of the tumor followed by neutral evolution, is accurate provided the spatial variation in the tumor mutation burden is not large. We show that there are substantial variations in ITH in distinct regions of a single solid tumor, which supports the notion that distinct subclones could co-exist. The simulations show that there are substantial variations in the sub-populations, with the ITH increasing as the distance between the regions increases. The analytical and simulation framework developed here could be used in the quantitative analyses of the experimental (M-Seq) data. More broadly, our theory is likely to be useful in analyzing dynamic heterogeneity in complex systems such as super-cooled liquids.",

    "abstract": "140-residue intrinsically disordered protein -synuclein (S) is known to be susceptible to environmental cues/crowders and adopts conformations that are vastly variable in the extent of secondary structure and tertiary interactions. Depending upon the nature of these interactions, some of the conformations may be suitable for its physiological functions while some may be predisposed to aggregate with other partners into higher ordered species or to phase separate. However, the inherently heterogenous and dynamic nature of S has precluded a clear demarcation of its monomeric precursor between aggregation-prone and functionally relevant aggregation-resistant states. Here, we optimally characterise a set of metastable conformations of S by developing a comprehensive Markov state model (MSM) using cumulative 108 {micro}s-long all-atom MD simulation trajectories of monomeric S. Notably, the dimension of the most populated metastable (85%) state (Rg [~] 2.59 ({+/-}0.45) nm) corroborates PRENMR studies of S monomer and undergoes kinetic transition at 0.1-150 {micro}s time-scale with weakly populated (0.06%) random-coil like ensemble (Rg [~] 5.85 ({+/-}0.43) nm) and globular protein-like state (14%) (Rg [~] 1.95 ({+/-}0.08) nm). The inter-residue contact maps identify a set of mutually interconverting aggregation-prone {beta}-sheet networks in the NAC region and aggregation-resistant long-range interactions between N- and C-terminus or helical conformations. The presence of crowding agents compacts the MSM-derived metastable conformations in a non-monotonic fashion and skews the ensemble by either introducing new tertiary contacts or reinforcing the innate contacts to adjust to the excluded-volume effects of such environments. These observations of crucial monomeric states would serve as important steps towards rationalising routes that trigger S-associated pathologies.\n\nSignificance statement-synuclein, a neuronal protein, is often associated with neurogenerative diseases due to its tendency to self-assemble into higher ordered aggregates. While the monomeric precursor of this protein is intrinsically disordered, it is also known to be susceptible to biological environmental cues and adopts a wide range of conformations that are either primed for aggregation or remain in auto-inhibitory states. However, the inherently heterogenous nature of the monomeric form has prevented a clear dissection of aggregation-prone and functionally relevant aggregation-resistant states. Here, we resolve this via an atomistic characterisation of an optimal set of crucial metastable monomeric conformations via statistical modelling of computer simulated data. The investigation also sheds light on crowding-induced modulation of the ensemble and eventual fibrillation pathways.",

We employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing in a paired diagnostic and post-therapy medulloblastoma to unravel the haplotype-resolved somatic genetic and epigenetic landscape. We assemble complex rearrangements and such associated with telomeric sequences, including a 1.55 Megabasepair chromothripsis event. We uncover a complex SV pattern termed  templated insertion thread, characterized by short (mostly <1kb) insertions showing prevalent self-concatenation into highly amplified structures of up to 50kbp in size. Templated insertion threads occur in 3% of cancers, with a prevalence ranging to 74% in liposarcoma, and frequent colocalization with chromothripsis. We also perform long-read based methylome profiling and discover allele-specific methylation (ASM) effects, complex rearrangements exhibiting differential methylation, and differential promoter methylation in seven cancer-driver genes.

    "abstract": "PurposeRadionuclide irradiators (137Cs and 60Co) are commonly used in preclinical studies ranging from cancer therapy to stem cell biology. There are institutional initiatives to replace radionuclide sources with lower-energy X-ray sources amidst concerns of radiological terrorism. As researchers transition, there are questions whether the biological effects of {gamma}-rays may be recapitulated with orthovoltage X-rays, since different energy may cause different biological effects. We, therefore, sought to compare the effects of orthovoltage X-rays and 137Cs {gamma}-rays using mouse models of acute radiation syndrome.\n\nExperimental Design137Cs {gamma}-rays were compared with Orthovoltage X-rays, generated at 300 kVp, 10 mA with 1 mm Cu or Thoraeus filtration. We assessed 30-day overall survival following whole-body irradiation and calculated LD50 by logistic regression. Comparing equivalent doses delivered with different average energies ([E]), we assessed bone marrow, spleen, and intestinal histology and flow cytometry.\n\nResultsThe LD50 doses are 6.7 Gy, 7.4 Gy and 8.1 Gy with 1 mm Cu filtered ([E]=120 keV), and Thoraeus filtered X-rays ([E]=160 keV), and 137Cs (E=662 keV), respectively. At constant dose, hematopoietic injury was most severe with 1 mm Cu filtered X-rays with the greatest reduction in bone marrow cellularity, stem and progenitor populations, and intestinal crypts and OLFM4+ intestinal stem cells. Thoraeus filtered X-rays provoked an intermediate phenotype, with 137Cs showing the least damage.\n\nConclusionsOur study reveals a dichotomy between physical dose and biological effect relevant as researchers transition to orthovoltage X-rays. With decreasing energy, there is increasing hematopoietic and intestinal injury, necessitating dose-reduction to achieve comparable biological effects.\n\nStatement of Translational RelevanceRadiation is used in translational studies in fields ranging from hematopoiesis and stem cell biology to cancer radiotherapy, with 137Cs and 60Co radionuclide sources serving as the most common irradiators. Due to the threat of radiological terrorism using stolen radionuclides, there are institutional initiatives to replace these sources with orthovoltage X-ray irradiators. Yet, as shown in this study, the biological effects of radiation are highly dependent on radiation energy. Lower energy orthovoltage X-rays are absorbed differently than higher energy radionuclide {gamma}-rays, provoking more severe hematopoietic, immunologic, and gastrointestinal radiation injury. Thus, an identical physical dose delivered with beams of differing energy does not produce the same biologic effect. As researchers transition between these sources, it is critical that we appreciate that radiation doses are not interchangeable between them. Understanding the significance of physical dose delivered using different methods will allow us to contextualize past results with future studies.",

The main function of this organelle is the synthesis and folding of a significant portion of cellular proteins, while also being the major calcium reservoir of the cell. Upon unresolved ER stress, a set of stress response signaling pathways that are collectively labeled as the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. Prolonged or intense activation of this molecular machinery may be deleterious. It is known that compromised ER homeostasis, and consequent UPR activation, characterize the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease.\n\nIn an effort to discover new small molecules capable of countering ER stress, we subjected a panel of over 100 natural molecules to a battery of assays designed to evaluate several hallmarks of ER stress. The effect of the compounds on calcium homeostasis, key gene and protein expression, and levels of protein aggregation were evaluated in fibroblasts, and subsequently in neuronal cells. This framework resulted in the identification of several bioactive molecules capable of countering ER stress and deleterious events associated to it, among which delphinidin stands out as the most promising candidate against neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "In vitro models of the peripheral nervous system would benefit from further refinements to better support studies on neuropathies. In particular, the assessment of pain-related signals is still difficult in human cell cultures. Here, we harnessed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate peripheral sensory neurons enriched in nociceptors. The objective was to generate a culture system with signaling endpoints suitable for pharmacological and toxicological studies. Neurons generated by conventional differentiation protocols expressed moderate levels of P2X3 purinergic receptors and only low levels of TRPV1 capsaicin receptors, when maturation time was kept to the upper practically-useful limit of 6 weeks. As alternative approach, we generated cells with an inducible NGN1 transgene. Ectopic expression of this transcription factor during a defined time window of differentiation resulted in highly-enriched nociceptor cultures, as determined by functional (P2X3 and TRPV1 receptors) and immunocytochemical phenotyping, complemented by extensive transcriptome profiling. Single cell recordings of Ca2+-indicator fluorescence from >9,000 cells were used to establish the \"fraction of reactive cells\" in a stimulated population as experimental endpoint, that appeared robust, transparent and quantifiable. To provide an example of application to biomedical studies, functional consequences of prolonged exposure to the chemotherapeutic drug oxaliplatin were examined at non-cytotoxic concentrations. We found (i) neuronal (allodynia-like) hypersensitivity to otherwise non-activating mechanical stimulation that could be blocked by modulators of voltage-gated sodium channels; (ii) hyper-responsiveness to TRPV1 receptor stimulation. These findings and several other measured functional alterations indicate that the model is suitable for pharmacological and toxicological studies related to peripheral neuropathies.",

    "abstract": "Increased neuronal excitability contributes to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) production and aggregation in the Alzheimers disease (AD) brain. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that hyperglycemia, or elevated blood glucose levels, increased brain excitability and A{beta} release potentially through inward rectifying, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. KATP channels are present on several different cell types and help to maintain excitatory thresholds throughout the brain. KATP channels are sensitive to changes in the metabolic environment, which are coupled to changes in cellular excitability. Therefore, we hypothesized that neuronal KATP channels are necessary for the hyperglycemic-dependent increases in extracellular A{beta} and eliminating KATP channel activity will uncouple the relationship between metabolism, excitability, and A{beta} pathology. First, we demonstrate that Kir6.2/KCNJ11, the pore forming subunits, and SUR1/ABCC8, the sulfonylurea receptors, are predominantly expressed on excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the human brain and that cortical expression of KCNJ11 and ABCC8 change with AD pathology in humans and rodent models. Next, we crossed APP/PS1 mice with Kir6.2 -/- mice, which lack neuronal KATP channel activity, to define the relationship between KATP channels, A{beta}, and hyperglycemia. Using in vivo microdialysis and hyperglycemic clamps, we explored how acute elevations in peripheral blood glucose levels impacted hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose, lactate, and A{beta} levels in APP/PS1 mice with or without KATP channels. Kir6.2+/+, APP/PS1 mice and Kir6.2-/-, APP/PS1 mice were exposed to a high sucrose diet for 6 months to determine the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on A{beta} deposition. We found that elevations in blood glucose levels correlate with increased ISF A{beta}, amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and amyloid plaque pathology in APP/PS mice with intact KATP channels. However, neither acute hyperglycemia nor chronic sucrose overconsumption raised ISF A{beta} or increased A{beta} plaque burden in APP/PS1 mice lacking Kir6.2-KATP channel activity. Mechanistic studies demonstrate ISF glucose not only correlates with ISF A{beta} but also ISF lactate. Without KATP channel activity, ISF lactate does not increase during hyperglycemia, which correlates with decreased monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expression, a lactate transporter responsible for astrocytic lactate release. This suggests that KATP channel activity regulates ISF lactate during hyperglycemia, which is important for A{beta} release and aggregation. These studies identify a new role for Kir6.2-KATP channels in Alzheimers disease pathology and suggest that pharmacological antagonism of Kir6.2-KATP channels holds therapeutic promise in reducing A{beta} pathology, especially in diabetic and prediabetic patients.",

In PD, the amygdala is prone to develop insoluble Syn aggregates, and it has been suggested that circuit dysfunction involving the amygdala contributes to the psychiatric symptoms. Yet, how Syn aggregates affect amygdala function is unknown. In this study, we examined Syn in glutamatergic axon terminals and the impact of its aggregation on glutamatergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We found that Syn is primarily present in the vesicular glutamate transporter 1-expressing (vGluT1+) terminals in mouse BLA, which is consistent with higher levels of Syn expression in vGluT1+ glutamatergic neurons in the cerebral cortex relative to the vGluT2+ glutamatergic neurons in the thalamus. We found that Syn aggregation selectively decreased the cortico-BLA, but not the thalamo-BLA, transmission; and that cortico-BLA synapses displayed enhanced short-term depression upon repetitive stimulation. In addition, using confocal microscopy, we found that vGluT1+ axon terminals exhibited decreased levels of soluble Syn, which suggests that lower levels of soluble Syn might underlie the enhanced short-term depression of cortico-BLA synapses. In agreement with this idea, we found that cortico-BLA synaptic depression was also enhanced in Syn knockout mice.\n\nIn conclusion, both basal and dynamic cortico-BLA transmission were disrupted by abnormal aggregation of Syn and these changes might be relevant to the perturbed cortical control of the amygdala that has been suggested to play a role in psychiatric symptoms in PD.",

    "abstract": "Infant avoidance and aggression are promoted by activation of the Urocortin-3 expressing neurons of the perifornical area of hypothalamus (PeFAUcn3) in male and female mice. PeFAUcn3 neurons have been implicated in stress, and stress is known to reduce maternal behavior. We asked how chronic restraint stress (CRS) affects infant-directed behavior in virgin and lactating females and what role PeFAUcn3 neurons play in this process. Here we show that infant-directed behavior increases activity in the PeFAUcn3 neurons in virgin and lactating females. Chemogenetic inhibition of PeFAUcn3 neurons facilitates pup retrieval in virgin females. CRS reduces pup retrieval in virgin females and increases activity of PeFAUcn3 neurons but does not affect maternal behavior in mothers. Inhibition of PeFAUcn3 neurons blocks stress-induced deficits in pup-directed behavior in virgin females. Together, these data illustrate the critical role for PeFAUcn3 neuronal activity in mediating the impact of chronic stress on female infant-directed behavior.\n\nSignificance statementWhile a large body of research has studied the impact of maternal stress on offspring, few studies have focused on the neural circuitry underlying reduced maternal behavior in stressed mothers. In this study, we examine the neural substrates involved in reduced infant-directed behavior caused by chronic stress. We find that perifornical area neurons expressing the neuropeptide urocortin-3 are critical mediators of the impact of stress on infant-directed behavior in females.",

    "abstract": "The thalamus is the principal information hub of the vertebrate brain, with essential roles in sensory and motor information processing, attention, and memory. The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinsons disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Long-term contaminated environments have been recognized as potential hotspots for bacterial discovery in taxonomic and functional terms for bioremediation purposes. Here, bacterial diversity in waste sediment collected from a former industrial dumpsite and contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon and heavy metals was investigated through the parallel application of culture-independent (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and -dependent (plate culturing followed by colony picking and identification of isolates by 16S rRNA gene Sanger sequencing) approaches. The bacterial diversities retrieved by both approaches greatly differed. Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were dominant in the culture-independent community, while Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were the main culturable groups. Only 2.7% of OTUs (operational taxonomic units) in the culture-independent dataset were cultured. Most of the culturable OTUs were absent or in very low abundances in the culture-independent dataset, revealing that culturing is a useful tool to study the rare bacterial biosphere. One culturable OTUs (comprising only the isolate SPR117) was identified as a potential new species in the genus Rhizorhapis (class Alphaproteobacteria) and was selected for further characterization. Phytopathogenicity tests showed that Rhizorhapis sp. strain SPR117 (ATCC TSD-228) is not pathogenic for lettuce, despite the only described species within this genus, Rhizorhapis suberifaciens, is causal agent of the lettuce corky root disease. The genome of the strain SPR117 was sequenced, assembled in 256 contigs, with a length of 4,419,522 bp and a GC content of 59.9%), and its further annotation revealed the presence of genes related to the resistance to arsenic, copper, iron, and mercury, among other metals. Therefore, the coupling of metataxonomics and culturing is a useful tool to obtain not only an improved description of bacterial communities in contaminated environments, but also to isolate microorganisms with bioremediation potential.",

    "abstract": "Cooperatively breeding species exhibit numerous strategies to avoid mating with close relatives, inherently reducing effective population size. For species of management concern, accurate estimates of inbreeding and trait depression are crucial for the species future. We utilized genomic and pedigree data for Yellowstone National Park gray wolves to investigate the contributions of foundation stock lineages, genetic architecture of the effective population, and putative fitness consequences of inbreeding. Our dataset spans 25 years and seven generations since reintroduction, encompassing 152 nuclear families and 329 litters. We found over 87% of the pedigree foundation genomes persisted and report influxes of allelic diversity from two translocated wolves from a divergent source in Montana. As expected for group-living species, mean kinship significantly increased over time, although we found high retention of genetic variation. Strikingly, the effective population carried a significantly lower level of genome-wide inbreeding coefficients and autozygosity with shorter decays for linkage disequilibrium relative to the non-breeding population. Lifespan and heterozygosity were higher in the effective population, although individuals who had their first litter at an older age also had higher inbreeding coefficients. Our findings highlight genetic contributions to fitness, and the importance of effective population size and gene flow to counteract loss of genetic variation in a wild, free-ranging social carnivore. It is crucial for managers to mitigate factors that significantly reduce effective population size and genetic connectivity, which supports the dispersion of genetic variation that aids in rapid evolutionary responses to environmental challenges.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenomic analyses routinely estimate species trees using methods that account for gene tree discordance. However, the most scalable species tree inference methods, which summarize independently inferred gene trees to obtain a species tree, are sensitive to hard-to-avoid errors introduced in the gene tree estimation step. This dilemma has created much debate on the merits of concatenation versus summary methods and practical obstacles to using summary methods more widely and to the exclusion of concatenation. The most successful attempt at making summary methods resilient to noisy gene trees has been contracting low support branches from the gene trees. Unfortunately, this approach requires arbitrary thresholds and poses new challenges. Here, we introduce threshold-free weighting schemes for the quartet-based species tree inference, the metric used in the popular method ASTRAL. By reducing the impact of quartets with low support or long terminal branches (or both), weighting provides stronger theoretical guarantees and better empirical performance than the original ASTRAL. More consequentially, weighting dramatically improves accuracy in a wide range of simulations and reduces the gap with concatenation in conditions with low gene tree discordance and high noise. On empirical data, weighting improves congruence with concatenation and increases support. Together, our results show that weighting, enabled by a new optimization algorithm we introduce, dramatically improves the utility of summary methods and can reduce the incongruence often observed across analytical pipelines.",

This is especially the case in New Zealand, where genomics resources are urgently needed to assist fisheries management attains its sustainability goals. Here we generated 55 Gb of short Illumina reads (92x coverage) and 73 Gb of long Nanopore reads (122x) to produce the first genome assembly of the marine teleost tarakihi (Nemadactylus macropterus), a highly valuable fisheries species in New Zealand. An additional 300 Mb of Iso-Seq RNA reads were obtained from four tissue types of another specimen to assist in gene annotation. The final genome assembly was 568 Mb long and consisted of 1,214 scaffolds with an N50 of 3.37 Mb. The genome completeness was high, with 97.8% of complete Actinopterygii BUSCOs. Heterozygosity values estimated through k-mer counting (1.00%) and bi-allelic SNPs (0.64%) were high compared to the same values reported for other fishes. Repetitive elements covered 30.45% of the genome and 20,169 protein-coding genes were annotated. Iso-Seq analysis recovered 91,313 unique transcripts (isoforms) from 15,515 genes (mean ratio of 5.89 transcripts per gene), and the most common alternative splicing event was intron retention. This highly contiguous genome assembly along with the isoform-resolved transcriptome will provide a useful resource to assist the study of population genomics, as well as comparative eco-evolutionary studies in other teleost and related organisms.",

MDR3 dysfunction is associated with various liver diseases, ranging from severe progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis to transient forms of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and familial gallstone disease. Single amino acid substitutions are often found as causative of dysfunction, but identifying the substitution effect in in vitro studies is time- and cost-intensive.\n\nMain resultsWe developed Vasor (Variant assessor of MDR3), a machine learning-based model to classify novel MDR3 missense variants into the categories benign or pathogenic. Vasor was trained on the, to date, largest dataset specific for MDR3 of benign and pathogenic variants and uses general predictors, namely EVE, EVmutation, PolyPhen-2, I-Mutant2.0, MUpro, MAESTRO, PON-P2, and other variant properties such as half-sphere exposure, PTM site, and secondary structure disruption as input. Vasor consistently outperformed the integrated general predictors and the external prediction tool MutPred2, leading to the current best prediction performance for MDR3 single-site missense variants (on an external test set: F1-score: 0.90, MCC: 0.80). Furthermore, Vasor predictions cover the entire sequence space of MDR3. Vasor is accessible as a webserver at https://cpclab.uni-duesseldorf.de/mdr3_predictor/ for users to rapidly obtain prediction results and a visualization of the substitution site within the MDR3 structure.\n\nConclusionThe MDR3-specific prediction tool Vasor can provide reliable predictions of single site amino acid substitutions, giving users a fast way to assess initially whether a variant is benign or pathogenic.",

    "abstract": "Data analyses by machine learning (ML) algorithms are gaining popularity in biomedical research. When time-to-event data are of interest, censoring is common and needs to be properly addressed. Most ML methods cannot conveniently and appropriately take the censoring information into consideration, potentially leading to inaccurate or biased results. We aim to develop a general-purpose method for imputing censored survival data, facilitating downstream ML analysis. In this study, we propose a novel method of imputing the survival times for censored observations. The proposal is based on their conditional survival distributions (CondiS) derived from Kaplan-Meier estimators. CondiS can replace censored observations with their best approximations from the statistical model, allowing for direct application of ML methods. When covariates are available, we extend CondiS by incorporating the covariate information through ML modeling (CondiS-X), which further improves the accuracy of the imputed survival time. Compared with existing methods with similar purposes, the proposed methods achieved smaller prediction errors and higher concordance with the underlying true survival times in extensive simulation studies. We also demonstrated the usage and advantages of the proposed methods through two real-world cancer datasets. The major advantage of CondiS is that it allows for the direct application of standard ML techniques for analysis once the censored survival times are imputed. We present a user-friendly R package to implement our method, which is a useful tool for ML-based biomedical research in this era of big data.",

    "abstract": "What limits the rate of contraction in muscle? The molecular cycling of actomyosin crossbridges has typically been assumed to be rate limiting, but muscle is a soft, wet and active tissue that is spatially heterogeneous and heirarchically organized. To bridge these multiple scales, we propose a minimal multiscale model that describes muscle as an active sponge and show how contractions generically induce intracellular fluid flow and power active hydraulic oscillations which dictate the ultimate limits of muscle performance. By reanalyzing data from existing experiments across different species and muscle types, we highlight the role of spatially heterogeneous strains and local volumetric deformations. We further demonstrate that the viscoelastic response of muscle is naturally nonreciprocal (or  odd) due to its active and anisotropic nature that shows how periodic cycles in spatial strain alone can produce work, in sharp contrast to previous views that focus on temporal cycles. Our work suggests the need for a revised view of muscle dynamics that emphasizes the multiscale spatio-temporal origins of soft hydraulic power, with implications for physiology, biomechanics and locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Contraction of cardiac and skeletal muscle is initiated by calcium (Ca2+) binding to regulatory proteins on actin-containing thin filaments. During muscle contraction, structural changes in Ca2+-dependent thin filament allow the binding of myosin motors to drive muscle contraction1. The dynamic switching between the resting off states and the active on states of myosin is also critical in regulating muscle contractility2-4. However, the molecular switch on the myosin-containing thick filament that drives this process is not understood. Here we show that cardiac thick filaments are directly Ca2+-regulated. We find that Ca2+ progressively moves the myosin heads from ordered off states close to the thick filament backbone to disordered on states closer to the thin filaments. This Ca2+-dependent structural shift of myosin is accompanied by a biochemically defined transition from the inactive super-relaxed state(s) to the active disordered relaxed state(s)3. Furthermore, we find that this Ca2+-mediated molecular switching is an intrinsic property of cardiac myosin but only when assembled into thick filaments. This novel concept of Ca2+ as a regulatory modulator of the thick filament provides a fresh perspective on cardiac muscle regulation, which may be particularly valuable for devising restorative treatments for pathologies altering the Ca2+ sensitivity of the sarcomere.",

Mechanisms of biomechanical changes and their relations to the molecular processes are crucial for understanding the function and dysfunction of the brain. In our study, we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify the alterations in biomechanical properties in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation (RO). Obtained results reveal several characteristics. Cell viability remained at the same level, regardless of the OGD and RO conditions, but, in parallel, the metabolic activity of cells decreased with OGD duration. 24h RO did not recover the metabolic activity fully. Cells subjected to OGD appeared softer than control cells. Cell softening was strongly present in cells after 1h of OGD and, with longer OGD duration and in RO conditions, cells recovered their mechanical properties. Changes in the nanomechanical properties of cells were attributed to the remodelling of actin filaments, which was related to cofilin-based regulation and impaired metabolic activity of cells. The presented study shows the importance of nanomechanics in research on ischemic-related pathological processes such as stroke.",

    "abstract": "Microbial alterations within the gut microbiome appear to be a common feature of individuals with Parkinsons disease (PD), providing further evidence for the role of the gut-brain axis in PD development. As a major site of contact with the environment, questions have emerged surrounding the cause and effect of alterations to the gut microbiome by environmental contaminants associated with PD risk, such as pesticides, metals, and organic solvents. Recent data from our lab shows that ingestion of the industrial byproduct and environmental pollutant trichloroethylene (TCE) induces key Parkinsonian pathology within aged rats, including the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, -synuclein accumulation, neuroinflammation, and endolysosomal deficits. As TCE is the most common organic contaminant within drinking water, we postulated that ingestion of TCE associated with PD-related neurodegeneration may alter the gut microbiome to a similar extent as observed in persons with PD. To assess this, we collected fecal samples from adult rats treated with 200 mg/kg TCE over 6 weeks via oral gavage - the dose that produced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration - and analyzed the gut microbiome via whole genome shotgun sequencing. Our results showed changes in gut microorganisms reflective of the microbial signatures observed in individuals with idiopathic PD, such as decreased abundance of short-chain fatty acid producing Blautia and elevated lactic-acid producing Bifidobacteria, as well as genera who contain species previously reported as opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium. From these experimental data, we postulate that TCE exposure within contaminated drinking water could induce alterations of the gut microbiome that contributes to chronic disease risk, including idiopathic PD.",

We have previously proposed a motor-dependent length-sensing and growth-regulating mechanism wherein a partial reduction in the levels of microtubule motor proteins should lead to accelerated neuronal growth. This prediction was originally validated in sensory neurons heterozygous for the Loa point mutation in dynein heavy chain 1 (Dync1h1Loa). Here we describe a new mouse model with a conditional allele allowing deletion of exons 24-25 in Dync1h1. Homozygous Islet1-Cre deletion of Dync1h1 is embryonic lethal, but heterozygous animals (Isl1-Dync1h1+/-) survive to adulthood with approximately 50% dynein expression in targeted cell types. Isl1-Dync1h1+/- adult sensory neurons reveal an accelerated growth phenotype, similar to that previously reported in Dync1h1Loa neurons. Moreover, Isl1-Dync1h1+/- mice show mild impairments in gait, proprioception and tactile sensation; and slightly impaired recovery from peripheral nerve injury. Thus, conditional deletion of Dync1h1 exons 24-25 enables targeted studies of the role of dynein in neuronal growth and neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes affect many aspects of host biology, but the eco-evolutionary forces that shape their diversity in natural populations remain poorly understood. Geographic gradients, like latitudinal clines, generate predictable patterns in biodiversity at macroecological scales, but whether these macro-scale processes apply to host-microbiome interactions is an open question. To address this question, we sampled the microbiomes of 13 natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster along a latitudinal cline in eastern United States. The microbiomes were surprisingly consistent across the cline-latitude did not predict either alpha or beta diversity. Only a narrow taxonomic range of bacteria were present in all microbiomes, indicating that strict taxonomic filtering by the host and neutral ecological dynamics are the primary factors shaping the fly microbiome. Additional temporal sampling across two independent sites revealed significant differences in microbial communities over time, suggesting that local environmental differences that vary at fine spatiotemporal scales are more likely to shape the microbiome. Our findings reveal the complexity of eco-evolutionary interactions shaping microbial variation in D. melanogaster and highlight the need for additional sampling of the microbiomes in natural populations along environmental gradients.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing three dimensional (3D) chromatin structure from conformation capture assays (such as Hi-C) is a critical task in computational biology, since chromatin spatial architecture plays a vital role in numerous cellular processes and direct imaging is challenging. We previously introduced Poisson metric scaling (PoisMS), a technique that models chromatin by a smooth curve, which yielded promising results. In this paper, we advance several ways for improving PoisMS. In particular, we address initialization issues by using a smoothing spline basis. The resulting SPoisMS method produces a sequence of reconstructions re-using previous solutions as warm starts. Importantly, this approach permits smoothing degree to be determined via cross-validation which was problematic using our prior B-spline basis. In addition, motivated by the sparsity of Hi-C contact data, especially when obtained from single-cell assays, we appreciably extend the class of distributions used to model contact counts. We build a general distribution-based metric scaling (DBMS) framework, from which we develop zero-inflated and Hurdle Poisson models as well as negative binomial applications. Illustrative applications make recourse to bulk Hi-C data from IMR90 cells and single-cell Hi-C data from mouse embryonic stem cells.",
