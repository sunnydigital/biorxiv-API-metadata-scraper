    "abstract": "Cells have evolved communication methods to sense their microenvironments and send biological signals. In addition to the communication using ligands and receptors, cells use diverse channels including gap junctions to communicate with their immediate neighbors. Current approaches, however, cannot effectively capture the influence of various microenvironments. Here, we propose a novel approach that identifies cell neighbor-dependent gene expression (CellNeighborEX). After categorizing cells based on their microenvironment from spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, CellNeighborEX identifies diverse gene sets associated with partnering cell types, providing further insight. To categorize cells along with their environment, CellNeighborEX uses direct cell location or the mixture of transcriptome from multiple cells depending on the ST technology. We show that cells express different gene sets depending on the neighboring cell types in various tissues including mouse embryos, brain, and liver cancer. These genes were associated with development (in embryos) or metastases (liver cancer). We further validate that gene expression can be induced by neighboring partners. The neighbor-dependent gene expression suggests new potential genes involved in cell-cell interactions beyond what ligand-receptor co-expression can discover.",

    "abstract": "Results of the most recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure (CASP) competition demonstrate that protein backbones can be predicted with very high accuracy. In particular, the artificial intelligence methods of AlphaFold 2 from DeepMind were able to produce structures that were similar enough to experimental structures that many described the problem of protein prediction solved. However, for such structures to be used for drug docking studies requires precision in the placement of side chain atoms as well. Here we built a library of 1334 small molecules and examined how reproducibly they bound to the same site on a protein using QuickVina-W, a branch of the program Autodock that is optimized for blind searches. We discovered that the higher the backbone quality of the homology model the greater the similarity between the small molecule docking to the experimental and modeled structures. Furthermore, we found that specific subsets of this library were particularly useful for identifying small differences between the best of the best modeled structures. Specifically, when the number of rotatable bonds in the small molecule increased, differences in binding sites became more apparent.",

However, the infiltration pattern of TME cells in CRC samples and the immune escape mechanism underneath have not been studied sufficiently.\n\nMethodsTranscriptomic data from public datasets were retrieved online. In total, 1802 samples from the microarray dataset and 619 samples from the TCGA dataset were enrolled. The ssGSEA algorithm and unsupervised clustering were used for TME cells infiltration speculation and infiltration pattern recognition.\n\nResultsCRC samples can be classified into three distinct TME cell subtypes. Subtype 1, the immune-active subtype, was characterised by high infiltration of activated adaptive immune cells. Subtype 2, the immune-desert subtype, featured high tumour purity and low infiltration of immune and stromal cells. And subtype 3, stroma-rich subtype, had high infiltration of stromal cells. The stroma-rich subtype conferred a significantly worse prognosis. Three subtypes had different immune escape mechanisms. The immune-active subtype has the highest immune checkpoint expression level. In comparison, the immune-desert subtype had the lowest immunogenicity and the defective antigen presentation. And the stroma-rich subtype lacked activated immune cells.\n\nConclusionsDistinct TME cell subtypes and immune escape mechanisms may provide inspiration and direction for further researches on CRC immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancers have high mutation loads and many respond to immune checkpoint-inhibitors. We investigated how genetic and immune landscapes co-evolve in these tumors. All cases had high truncal mutation loads. Driver aberrations showed a clear hierarchy despite pervasive intratumor heterogeneity: Those in WNT/{beta}Catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase and TGF{beta} receptor family genes were almost always truncal. Immune evasion drivers were predominantly subclonal and showed parallel evolution. Pan-tumor evolution, subclonal evolution, and evolutionary stasis of genetic immune evasion drivers defined three MMRd CRC subtypes with distinct T-cell infiltrates. These immune evasion drivers have been implicated in checkpoint-inhibitor resistance. Clonality and subtype assessments are hence critical for predictive immunotherapy biomarker development. Cancer cell PD-L1 expression was conditional on loss of the intestinal homeobox transcription factor CDX2. This explains infrequent PD-L1 expression by cancer cells and likely contributes to the high recurrence risk of MMRd CRCs with impaired CDX2 expression.",

    "abstract": "Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) by O-GlcNAc globally rise during pressure-overload hypertrophy (POH). However, only a few specific proteins with altered O-GlcNAc levels during POH are known primarily because this PTM is easily lost during standard mass spectrometry (MS) conditions used for protein identification. Methodologies have recently emerged to stabilize the O-GlcNAc moiety for MS analysis. Accordingly, our goal was to determine the proteins undergoing changes in O-GlcNAc levels during POH. We used C57/Bl6 mice subjected to Sham or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to create POH. From the hearts, we stabilized and labelled the O-GlcNAc moiety with tetramethylrhodamine azide (TAMRA) before enriching by TAMRA immunoprecipitation (IP). We used LC-MS to identify the captured O-GlcNAcylated proteins. We identified a total of 707 O-GlcNAcylated proteins in Sham and POH. Two hundred thirty-three of these proteins were significantly increased in POH over Sham whereas no proteins were significantly decreased in POH. We examined two MS identified proteins, CPT1B and PDH, to validate the MS data by immunoprecipitation. We corroborated increased O-GlcNAc levels during POH for the metabolic enzymes CPT1B and PDH. Enzyme activity assays showed higher O-GlcNAcylation increased CPT1 activity and decreased PDH activity. In summary, we generated the first comprehensive list of proteins with changes in O-GlcNAc levels during POH and, to our knowledge, the largest list for any cardiac pathology. Our results demonstrate the large number of proteins and cellular processes affected by O-GlcNAc during POH and serve as a guide for testing specific O-GlcNAc-regulated mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere and the resulting negative impacts on climate change have compelled global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality or negativity. Most such efforts focus on carbon sequestration through chemical or physical approaches. We aim to harness the power of synthetic biology to enhance plants natural ability to draw down and sequester carbon, thereby positively affecting climate change. Past decades of scientific progress have shed light on strategies to overcome the intrinsic limitations of carbon drawdown and fixation through photosynthesis, particularly in row crops in hopes of improving agricultural productivity for food security. Incorporating a photorespiration bypass in C3 plants has shown promising results of increased biomass and grain yield. Despite their globally dominant role in atmospheric carbon flux, the drawdown rates of most trees are currently limited by their C3 photosynthetic metabolism, and efforts to improve the photosynthetic capacity of trees, such as by reducing energy loss in photorespiration, are currently lacking. Here, we selected a photorespiration bypass pathway and tested its effectiveness on photosynthetic enhancement in hybrid poplar INRA717-IB4. The design includes a RNAi strategy to reduce the transportation of the photorespiration byproduct, glycolate, out of chloroplast and a shunt pathway to metabolize the retained glycolate back to CO2 for fixation through the Calvin-Benson cycle. Molecular and physiological data collected from two repeated growth experiments indicates that transgenic plants expressing genes in the photorespiration bypass pathway have increased photosynthetic efficiency, leading to faster plant growth and elevated biomass production. One lead transgenic event accumulated 53% more above-ground dry biomass over a five month growth period in a controlled environment. Pilot projects with photosynthesis-enhanced trees in the field are in progress. Our results provide a proof-of-concept for engineering trees to help combat climate change.",

    "abstract": "Unravelling the mystery of Alzheimers Disease (AD) requires urgent resolution given the worldwide increase of the aging population. There is a growing concern that the current leading AD hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis, does not stand up to validation with respect to emerging new data. Indeed, several paradoxes are being discussed in the literature, for instance, both the deposition of the Amyloid-Beta peptide (A{beta}) and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) could occur within the brain without any cognitive pathology. Thus, these paradoxes suggest that something more fundamental is at play in the onset of the disease and other key and related pathomechanisms have to be investigated. The present study follows our previous investigations on the infectious hypothesis, which posits that some pathogens are linked to late onset AD. Our studies also build upon the shattering finding that A{beta} is a powerful antimicrobial agent capable of inhibiting pathogens as observed in in vitro experiments. Herein, we ask what are the molecular mechanisms in play when A{beta} neutralizes infectious pathogens? To answer this question, we probed at nanoscale lengths with FRET (Forster Resonance Energy Transfer), the interaction between A{beta} peptides and glycoprotein B (responsible of virus-cell binding) within the HSV-1 virion. We concluded that there is indeed a close interaction, likely nonspecific or semi-specific, between the two types of molecules, which participate in virus neutralization.",

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by gradual immune dysfunction and increased risk for many diseases, including respiratory infections. Genomic instability is thought to play a central role in the aging process but the mechanisms that damage nuclear DNA in aging are insufficiently defined. Cells that migrate or reside within confined environments experience forces applied to their nucleus, leading to transient nuclear envelope (NE) ruptures. NE ruptures are associated with DNA damage, and Lamin A/C is required to limit these events. Here, we show that Lamin A/C protects lung alveolar macrophages from NE rupture and hallmarks of aging. Lamin A/C ablation in immune cells results in a selective depletion of lung alveolar macrophages (AM) and a heightened susceptibility to influenza infection. Lamin A/C-deficient AM that persist display constitutive nuclear envelope rupture marks, DNA damage and p53-dependent senescence. In wild-type mice, we found that AM migrate within constricted spaces in vivo, at heights that induce NE rupture and DNA damage. AM from aged wild-type mice and from Lamin A/C-deficient mice share an upregulated lysosomal signature with CD63 expression, and we find that CD63 is required to clear damaged DNA in macrophages. We propose that induction of genomic instability by NE disruption represents a mechanism of aging in alveolar macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of biological processes is ubiquitous across the ecological and evolutionary disciplines. However, the increasing complexity of these models poses a significant challenge to the dissemination of model-derived results. With the existing standards of scientific publishing, most often only a small subset of model results are generated, presented in static figures or tables, and made available to the scientific community. Further exploration of the parameter space of a model, investigation of possible variations of a model, and validation of the results in relation to model assumptions commonly rely on local deployment of code supplied by the authors. While releasing model code is a publication requirement for most scientific journals, there are currently no standardized protocols or coding-language requirements. Deploying models locally poses a technical challenge due to the specific framework and environment in which a model was developed, and can preclude model validation and exploration by readers and reviewers. To address this issue, we developed a platform that serves as an interactive repository of biological models, called modelRxiv (https://modelrxiv.org). The platform provides a unified interface for the analysis of models developed in multiple programming languages but does not require any technical understanding of the model implementation. To reduce model computation time, the platform allows users to pool computational resources available to them, including lab workstations, clusters and cloud services. By making published models accessible, this platform promises to significantly improve the accessibility, reproducibility and validation of ecological and evolutionary models.",

While the read depth distribution of a sample is observable, the true VAF distribution of all mutations in a sample is uncertain when there is low coverage depth. We propose to estimate the VAF distributions that would be observed with high-depth sequencing for samples with low sequencing depth by grouping samples with similar clonality and purity and using the VAF distributions observed with the high-depth mutations that are available. With these estimated high-depth VAF distributions we then calculate what the expected VAF distributions would be at a given depth and compare against the observed VAF distributions at that depth. Using this procedure we estimate that The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) MC3 dataset only reports on average 83% of the mutations in a sample which would have been detected with high-depth sequencing. These results have important implications for comparing tumor mutational burden (TMB) estimates when samples are sequenced at different depths and for modeling high-depth, gene panel-based sequencing from the TCGA MC3 dataset.",

However, LD measurements are only reliable for common genetic variants, leaving low-frequency variants unanalyzed. In this work, we introduce cumulative LD (cLD), a stable statistic that captures the rare-variant LD between genetic regions, which reflects more biological interactions between variants, in addition to lack of recombination. We derived the theoretical variance of cLD using delta methods to demonstrate its higher stability than LD for rare variants. This property is also verified by bootstrapped simulations using real data. In application, we find cLD reveals an increased genetic association between genes in 3D chromatin interactions, a phenomenon recently reported negatively by calculating standard LD between common variants. Additionally, we show that cLD is higher between gene pairs reported in interaction databases, identifies unreported protein-protein interactions, and reveals interacting genes distinguishing case/control samples in association studies.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are extremely heterogeneous and highly vascularized neoplasms that arise from endocrine cells in the pancreas. pNETs harbor a subpopulation of stem cell-like cancer cells (cancer stem cells/CSCs), which contribute to intratumoral heterogeneity and promote tumor maintenance and recurrence. In this study we demonstrated that CSCs in human pNETs co-expressed PKD-1 and CD44. We further identified PKD-1 signaling as a critical pathway in the regulation of CSC maintenance in pNET cells. PKD-1 signaling regulated the expression of a CSC-related gene signature and promoted CSC self-renewal. Intriguingly, pharmacological or genetic disruption of PKD-1 signaling in human pNET cells impaired lysophosphatidic acid-induced expression of genes associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), specifically E-cadherin and vimentin. This study indicates that PKD-1 signaling is essential for the maintenance of a subpopulation of CSCs in pNETs at an intermediate state along the epithelial-mesenchymal spectrum, thereby leading to a CSC phenotype with plasticity and partial EMT. Inhibiting the PKD-1 pathway may facilitate the elimination of CSC subpopulations to curb pNET progression, therapeutic resistance and metastasis. Given that the signaling networks associated with CSC maintenance and EMT are complex and extend across multiple levels of gene regulation, this study provides insight into signaling regulation of partial EMT in determining CSC fate and aids in developing potential therapeutic strategies that target different subsets of CSCs in a variety of cancers.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint therapy shows impressive and durable clinical responses in cancer patients, but the genetic determinants that enable cancer cells to respond to anti-PD-1 therapy are still elusive. Herein, we identified that NIPBL deficiency promotes endogenous retrovirus (ERV) expression in tumour cells, which in turn inactivates CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) via the PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitory checkpoint pathway. Mechanistically, NIPBL deficiency impairs DNMT1 transcription, preventing DNMT1 from suppressing ERV expression in tumour cells; ERVs stimulate PD-L1 expression by inducing the STAT2-IRF9 complex, a downstream event of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-MAVS-IRF3 signalling, and thereby suppress CD8 TIL-mediated immunity. An anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody achieved remarkable therapeutic effects in Nipbl-deficient syngeneic tumour models and improved host survival by eliciting an antitumour memory immune response. Cancer patients harbouring mutations of cohesin subunits and regulators plus DNMT1 had significantly better responses to anti-PD-1 therapy than their non-mutated counterparts did. Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which cohesin complex deregulation stimulates ERV expression by impairing DNMT1 expression and fosters an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment by activating the PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitory checkpoint.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death worldwide. Effective treatments are required that limit adverse cardiac remodelling and preserve cardiac contractility following myocardial infarction, with the aim of improving patient outcomes and preventing progression to heart failure. The perfused but hypocontractile myocardium bordering a newly created infarct is functionally distinct from the remote surviving myocardium; it is also a major determinant of adverse cardiac remodelling and whole heart contractility. Expression of the transcription factor RUNX1 is increased in the border zone at 1 day after myocardial infarction, suggesting potential for targeted therapeutic intervention. Here we demonstrate that RUNX1 drives reductions in cardiomyocyte contractility, sarcoplasmic reticulum-mediated calcium release, mitochondrial density, and the expression of genes important for oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nAntagonising RUNX1 expression via short-hairpin RNA interference preserved cardiac contractile function following myocardial infarction when delivered either via direct adenoviral delivery into the border zone or via an adeno-associated virus vector administered intravenously. Equivalent effects were obtained with a small molecule inhibitor (Ro5-3335) that reduces RUNX1 function by blocking its interaction with the essential co-factor CBF{beta}. Both tamoxifen-inducible Runx1-deficient and Cbf{beta}-deficient cardiomyocyte-specific mouse models demonstrated that antagonising RUNX1 function preserves the expression of genes important for oxidative phosphorylation following myocardial infarction. Our results confirm the translational potential of RUNX1 as a novel therapeutic target in myocardial infarction, with wider opportunities for use across a range of cardiac diseases where RUNX1 drives adverse cardiac remodelling.",

    "abstract": "Brassinosteroids (BRs) control many important agronomic traits, therefore the manipulation of BR components could improve crop productivity and performance. However, the potential effects of BR-related genes on yield-related traits and stress tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) remain poorly understood. Here, we identified TaD11 genes in wheat (rice D11 orthologs) that encoded enzymes involved in BR biosynthesis. TaD11 genes were highly expressed in roots (Zadoks scale: Z11) and grains (Z75), while expression was significantly suppressed by exogenous BR (24-epiBL). Ectopic expression of TaD11-2A rescued the abnormal panicle structure and plant height (PH) of the cpb1 mutant, and also increased endogenous BR levels, resulting in improved grain yields and grain quality in rice. Natural variations in TaD11-2A were associated with significant differences in yield-related traits, including PH, grain width (GW), 1000-grain weight (TGW), and grain yield per plant (GYPP), and its favorable haplotype, TaD11-2A-HapI was subjected to positive selection during wheat breeding. Additionally, TaD11-2A influenced root length and salt tolerance in rice and wheat at seedling stages. These results indicated the important role of BR TaD11 biosynthetic genes in controlling grain size and root length, and also highlighted their potential in the molecular biological analysis of wheat.\n\nHighlightThe brassinosteroid biosynthesis gene TaD11-2A regulates grain size and root length and its haplotype favorably improves grain yields and salt tolerance in wheat.",

The GSA therefore plays a crucial role for the ability of plants to access nutrients and water in the soil. Despite its importance, only few regulatory pathways and mechanisms that determine GSA are known, and these mostly relate to auxin and cytokinin pathways. Here, we report the identification of a small molecule, Mebendazole (MBZ) that modulates GSA in Arabidopsis thaliana roots and acts via the activation of ethylene signaling. We uncover that MBZ directly acts on the serine/threonine protein kinase CTR1, which is a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our study not only reveals that the ethylene signaling pathway is essential for GSA regulation, but it also identifies a small molecular modulator of RSA and the first small molecule that acts downstream of ethylene receptors and that directly activates ethylene signaling.",

    "abstract": "Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) supplemented with the synergist piperonyl butoxide have been developed in response to growing pyrethroid resistance however their durability in the field remains poorly described. A pragmatic cluster-randomised trial was embedded into Ugandas 2017-2018 distribution to compare the durability of LLINs with and without PBO\n\nA total of 104 clusters were included with each receiving one of four LLIN products, two with pyrethroid+PBO (Olyset Plus and PermaNet 3.0) and two pyrethroid-only (Olyset Net and PermaNet 2.0). Nets were sampled at baseline, 12, and 25 months post-distribution to assess physical condition, chemical content, and bioefficacy. Physical condition was quantified using proportionate Hole Index and chemical content measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Bioefficacy was assessed with three-minute WHO Cone and Wireball assays using pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae, with 1hr knockdown and 24hr mortality recorded.\n\nThere was no difference in physical durability between LLIN products assessed (p=0.644). The pyrethroid content of all products remained relatively stable across timepoints but PBO content declined by 55% (p<0.001) and 58% (p<0.001) for Olyset Plus and PermaNet 3.0 respectively. Both PBO LLINs were highly effective against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes when new, knocking down all mosquitoes. However, bioefficacy declined over time with Olyset Plus knocking down 45.72% (95% CI: 22.84-68.62, p=0.021) and Permanet 3.0 knocking down 78.57% (95% CI: 63.57-93.58, p<0.001) after 25 months.\n\nHere we demonstrate that both Olyset Plus and PermaNet 3.0 are as durable as their pyrethroid-only equivalents and had superior bioefficacy against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae. However, the superiority of PBO-LLINs decreased with operational use, correlating with a reduction in total PBO content. This decline in bioefficacy after just two years is concerning and there is an urgent need to assess the durability of PBO LLINs in other settings.",

    "abstract": "Motor adaptation describes the ability of the motor system to counteract repeated perturbations in order to reduce movement errors. Most research in the field investigated adaptation in response to perturbations affecting the moving hand. Fewer studies looked at the effect of a perturbation applied to the movement target, however they used simplistic visual stimuli. In this study, we examined motor adaptation to perturbations affecting the motion of dynamic targets. In addition, we asked whether external visual cues in the environment could facilitate this process. To do so, participants were asked to play an online version of the Pong game in which they intercepted a ball bouncing off a wall using a paddle. A perturbation was applied to alter the post-bounce trajectory of the ball and the wall orientation was manipulated to be consistent or not with the ball trajectory. The \"trained tilt\" group (n = 34) adapted to the consistent condition and the \"trained horizontal\" group (n = 36) adapted to the inconsistent condition. In case participants optimally integrate external visual cues, the \"trained tilt\" group is expected to exhibit faster and/or more complete adaptation than the \"trained horizontal\" group. We found that the perturbation reduced interception accuracy. Participants showed large interception errors when the perturbation was introduced, followed by rapid error decrease and aftereffects (errors in the opposite direction) once the perturbation was removed. Although both experimental groups showed these typical markers of motor adaptation, we did not find differences in interception success rates or errors between the \"trained tilt\" and \"trained horizontal\" groups. Our results demonstrate that participants quickly adapted to the dynamics of the pong ball. However, the visual tilt of the bouncing surface did not enhance their performance. The present study highlights the ability of the motor system to adapt to external perturbations applied to a moving target in a more dynamical environment and in online settings. These findings underline the prospects of further research on sensorimotor adaptation to unexpected changes in the environment using more naturalistic and complex real-world or virtual reality tasks as well as gamified paradigms.",

Seven brain regions associated with motor learning and sensorimotor function were investigated.\n\nResultsAll participants improved task-specific reaching movements after training. In individuals with stroke: 1) pre-training myelin water fraction was lower in motor brain regions but higher in the cingulum compared to controls, 2) pre-training myelin water fraction in motor and sensorimotor regions was positively associated with learning rate, and 3) myelin water fraction was increased in the ipsilesional (contralateral to the trained arm) superior longitudinal fasciculus following skilled motor practice.\n\nConclusionsFindings indicate that after stroke, myelin water fraction is related to measures of motor learning and modulated by 4 weeks of skilled motor practice with the paretic limb.

    "abstract": "Endocytosis through Drosophila glia is a significant determinant of sleep amount and occurs preferentially during sleep in glia of the blood brain barrier (BBB). To identify metabolites whose trafficking is mediated by sleep-dependent endocytosis, we conducted metabolomic analysis of flies that have increased sleep due to a block in glial endocytosis. We report that acylcarnitines, molecules that conjugate with long chain fatty acids to promote their transport, accumulate in heads of these animals. In parallel, to identify transporters and receptors whose loss contributes to the sleep phenotype caused by blocked endocytosis, we screened genes enriched in barrier glia for effects on sleep. We find that knockdown of lipid transporters LRP1&2 as well as carnitine transporters ORCT1&2 increases sleep. In support of the idea that the block in endocytosis affects trafficking through specific transporters, knockdown of LRP or ORCT transporters also increases acylcarnitines in heads. We propose that lipid species, such as acylcarnitines, are trafficked through the BBB via sleep-dependent endocytosis, and their accumulation in the brain increases the need for sleep.",

Wilhelm elevational transect is one such example, having been used to study the birds, insects, and plants of Papua New Guinea (PNG). However, a survey of mammals from this forest elevational transect was lacking. We thus aimed to investigate patterns in the community structure and species richness of bats (Chiroptera) along the transect, link the species to available regional data, and explain the observed patterns by including environmental characteristics. Bat communities were surveyed between 200 m and a timberline at 3,700 m a.s.l. at eight study sites separated by 500 m in elevation. We conducted mist-netting and acoustic surveys to detect and identify species at each site. Regional data were compiled to compare local with regional diversity. Finally, biotic (i.e., food availability, habitat features) and abiotic (i.e., mean daily temperature, available land area) factors were included in our analyses to disentangle the ecological drivers underlying bat diversity. Results revealed that species richness decreases with ascending elevation and was best explained by a corresponding decrease in both area and temperature. We also observed community turnover along the transect at local and regional scales, along with the increase of species elevational ranges. Consequently, despite that the study was restricted to one mountain in PNG, it demonstrates how basic inventory surveys can be used to address ecological questions in other similar and undisturbed tropical mountains.",

    "abstract": "There is a complex interplay of criminal groups control over land, illicit activities, and forest cover change in the Colombian Andes-Amazon region. This area is dealing with diverse forms of conflict and peace, directly impacting landscape connectivity. While many studies have documented rapid deforestation after the peace agreement in 2016, we know little about the effect of these socio-political changes on the state of landscape connectivity. We disentangle habitat from connected habitat in forest ecosystems using the Landsat archive and landscape connectivity indices. We find that in the Andes-Amazon region during 2000-2020, connected habitat loss reached 18%, while habitat loss was 13%. This result is worrisome, because it indicates that well-connected patches are more fragmented and isolated, affecting the natural connections between the Andes and Amazon biogeographical regions and the movement ability of species. The Colombian government should conduct a strategic peacebuilding process incorporating structural changes that prevent the increase of large-scale extractive activities that are often illegal in the region. While finding a balance between extractive activities and conservation remains a big challenge, legal land tenure, census/taxation, and specific agreements with local actors can initially prevent deforestation. We discourage localized military actions and the return of aerial fumigation of coca fields, which rather than stop deforestation might exacerbate land cover change deeper into pristine forests.",

    "abstract": "In ecological and conservation studies, responsible researchers strive to obtain rich data while minimizing disturbance to wildlife and ecosystems. We assessed if samples collected noninvasively can be used for microbiome research, comparing microbiota of noninvasively collected fecal samples to those collected from trapped common cranes at the same sites over the same periods. We found significant differences in microbial composition (alpha and beta diversity), which were not accounted for by noninvasive samples exposure to soil contaminants, as manually assessed by comparing differentially abundant taxa. They could result from trapped birds exposure to sedatives. We conclude that if all samples are collected in the same manner, comparative analyses are valid, and noninvasive sampling may better represent host microbiota because there are no trapping effects. Experiments with fresh and delayed sample collection can elucidate effects of environmental exposures on microbiota. Further, stressing or sedation may unravel how trapping affects wildlife microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to many anthropogenic pollutants. Non-target effects of pesticides and fertilizers have put agricultural intensification in the focus as a driver for biodiversity loss. However, other pollutants, such as heavy metals, particulate matter, or microplastic also enter the environment, e.g. via traffic and industrial activities in urban areas. As soil acts as a potential sink for such pollutants, soil invertebrates like earthworms may be particularly affected by them. Under natural conditions soil invertebrates will likely be confronted with combinations of pollutants simultaneously, which may result in stronger negative effects if pollutants act synergistically.\n\nWithin this work we study how multiple pollutants affect the soil-dwelling, substrate feeding earthworm Eisenia fetida. We compared the effects of the single stressors, polystyrene microplastic fragments, polystyrene fibers, brake dust and soot, with the combined effect of these pollutants when applied as a mixture. Endpoints measured were survival, growth, reproductive fitness, and changes in three oxidative stress markers. We found that among single pollutant treatments, brake dust imposed the strongest negative effects on earthworms in all measured endpoints including increased mortality rates. Sub-lethal effects were found for all pollutants. Exposing earthworms to all four pollutants simultaneously led to effects on mortality and oxidative stress markers that were smaller than expected by the respective null models. These antagonistic effects are likely a result of the adsorption of toxic substances found in brake dust to the other pollutants. With this study we show that effects of combinations of pollutants cannot necessarily be predicted from their individual effects and that combined effects will likely depend on identity and concentration of the pollutants.",

    "abstract": "Migratory species are changing the timing of departures from wintering areas and arrival to breeding sites (i.e., migration phenology), as response to climate change to exploit maximum food availability at higher latitudes and improve their fitness. Despite the impact of changing migration phenology on migratory connectivity at population and community level, the extent to which such individual and species-specific response affects associations among co-migrating species has been seldom explored. By applying temporal co-occurrence network models on 15 years of standardized bird ringing data at a spring stopover site, we show that African-European migratory landbirds tend to migrate in well-defined groups of species with high temporal overlap. Such  co-migration fidelity is significantly increasing over the years and higher in trans-Saharan than North-African migrants. Our findings suggest non-random patterns of associations in co-migrating species, possibly related to the existence of regulatory mechanisms associated with changing climate conditions and different uses of stopover sites by migrants, ultimately influencing the global migration economy of landbirds in the Palearctic-African migration system.",

Therefore, it is prone to anthropogenic pressures which have led to local extinctions and a decline in population. We conducted five call count surveys at dusk and dawn from 15 April - 15 May 2020 in grasslands of Dharbhog panchayat, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh to assess presence of Cheer Pheasants in different habitat types. We used frequency of occurrence (number of encounters / number of visits) to determine presence or absence of Cheer Pheasant in an area of 10.5 km2 with ten established call count stations. We encountered Cheer Pheasants at six call count stations and the frequency of occurrence of the species ranged from 0 - 0.60. This survey provides an index of occupancy of the species and can be used to assess the change in habitat occupied by the species with time. The local forest department can also use these results to regulate over grazing and burning of grasslands during the breeding season in areas where we recorded the species.",

    "abstract": "Historical resurveys of ecological communities are important for placing the structure of modern ecosystems in context. Rarely, however, are snapshot surveys alone sufficient for providing direct insight into the rates of ecological processes that underlie how communities function, either now or in the past. In this study, I used a statistically-reasoned observational approach to estimate the feeding rates of a New Zealand intertidal predator, Haustrum haustorium, using diet surveys performed at several sites by Robert Paine in 1968-9 and by me in 2004. Comparisons between time periods reveal a remarkable consistency in H. haustoriums prey-specific feeding rates, which contrasts with the changes I observed in prey abundances, H. haustoriums body size distribution, and the proportional contributions of H. haustoriums prey to its apparent diet. Although these results imply accompanying and perhaps adaptive changes in H. haustoriums prey preferences, they are nonetheless anticipated by H. haustoriums high range of variation in prey-specific handling times that dictate not only its maximum possible feeding rates but also the probabilities with which feeding events may be detected during diet surveys. Similarly high variation in detection times (i.e. handling and digestion times) is evident in predator species throughout the animal kingdom. The potential disconnect between a predators apparent diet and its actual feeding rates suggests that much of the temporal and biogeographic variation that is perceived in predator diets and food-web structures may be of less functional consequence than currently assumed.",

    "abstract": "Clonal reproduction, the formation of new individuals that are genetically nearly identical to the parent via mitosis in the absence of genetic recombination, is a very common reproductive mode across plants, fungi, and animals. Current genetic marker based methods fail to detect clonal structure when all collected samples belong to one single clone, which seems to be more common than previously thought. Here we propose a new similarity index, \"Shared Heterozygosity (SH)\" based on the number of genetic markers (typically SNPs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms) that are identically heterozygous among two or more genomes (i.e., NSH). Ideally NSH should be on the order of approximately >=3,000, which can be easily achieved nowadays via Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing or whole-genome resequencing. One should be careful when NSH is small (roughly <1,000). We analyze two large seagrass clones (Posidonia australis, Zostera marina) along with two Z. marina clones of known age (17-yrs), and show that SH can potentially extend the detection of clonemates to any pair of samples with the aid of technical replicates. Another potential application of SH is to detect possible parent-descendant pairs under selfing, because the heterozygous loci in the selfing-produced descendants represent a subset of those in the parent. Our proposed workflow takes advantage of the availability of the larger number of genetic markers in the genomic era, and fills a gap in detecting clonemates in the growing number of cases where many or all samples at a location belong to one single clone.",

In contrast, fine-grained reconstructions of ancestral genome organisations are still in their infancy, limiting our ability to draw comprehensive views of genome and karyotype evolution. Here we reconstruct the detailed gene contents and organisations of 624 ancestral vertebrate, plant, fungi, metazoan and protist genomes, 183 of which are near-complete chromosomal reconstructions. Reconstructed ancestral genomes are similar to their descendants in terms of gene content as expected and agree precisely with reference cytogenetic and in silico reconstructions when available. By comparing successive ancestral genomes along the phylogenetic tree, we estimate the intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangement history of all major vertebrate clades at high resolution. This freely available resource introduces the possibility to follow evolutionary processes at genomic scales in chronological order, across multiple clades and without relying on a single extant species as reference.",

    "abstract": "France has a population with extensive internal fine-structure; and while public imputation reference panels contain an abundance of European genomes, there include few French genomes. Intuitively, using a  study specific panel (SSP) for France would therefore likely be beneficial. To investigate, we imputed 550 French individuals using either the University of Michigan imputation server with the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel, or in-house using an SSP of 850 whole-genome sequenced French individuals.\n\nWith approximate geo-localization of both our target and SSP individuals we are able to pinpoint different scenarios where SSP-based imputation would be preferred over server-based imputation or vice-versa. We could also show to a high degree of resolution how the proximity of the reference panel to a target individual determined the accuracy of both haplotype phasing and genotype imputation.\n\nPrevious comparisons of different strategies have shown the benefits of combining public reference panels with SSPs. Getting the best out of both resources simultaneously is unfortunately impractical. We put forward a pragmatic solution where server-based and SSP-based imputation outcomes can be combined based on comparing posterior genotype probabilities. Such an approach can give a level of imputation accuracy markedly in excess of what could be achieved with either strategy alone.",

    "abstract": "The causes of many complex human diseases are still largely unknown. Genetics plays an important role in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of complex human diseases. A key step to characterize the genetics of a complex human disease is to unbiasedly identify disease-associated gene transcripts in whole-genome scale. Confounding factors could cause false positives. Paired design, such as measuring gene expression before and after treatment for the same subject, can reduce the effect of known confounding factors. Model-based clustering, such as mixtures of Bayesian hierarchical models, has been proposed to detect gene transcripts differentially expressed between paired samples. However, not all known confounding factors can be controlled in a paired/match design. To the best of our knowledge, no clustering methods have the capacity to adjust for the effects of covariates yet. In this article, we proposed a novel mixture of Bayesian hierarchical models with covariate adjustment in identifying differentially expressed transcripts using high-throughput whole-genome data from paired design. Both simulation study and real data analysis show the good performance of the proposed method",

Multi-view high speed (200 Hz) image data were collected concurrently with marker-based motion capture (criterion data), permitting a direct comparison between methods. Lower limb kinematic data for 15 participants were computed using 2D pose estimation, our 3D fusion process and OpenSim based inverse kinematics modelling. Results demonstrated high levels of agreement for lower limb joint angles, with mean differences ranging between 0.1{degrees} - 10.5{degrees} for 6 DoF hip joint rotations, and 0.7{degrees} - 3.9{degrees} for knee and ankle rotations. These differences generally fall within the documented uncertainties of marker-based motion capture, suggesting that our markerless approach could be used for appropriate biomechanics applications. We used an open-source, modular and customisable workflow, allowing for integration with other popular biomechanics tools such as OpenSim. By developing open-source tools, we hope to facilitate the democratisation of markerless motion capture technology and encourage the transparent development of markerless methods. This presents exciting opportunities for biomechanics researchers and practitioners to capture large amounts of high quality, ecologically valid data both in the laboratory and in the wild.",

Parametric unstructured models based biological mechanisms are highly promising, since they do not require large amounts of data.

Currently Fisher-Information-Matrix based approximations or Monte-Carlo approaches are used to estimate parameter confidence intervals and regularization approaches to decrease parameter uncertainty.\n\nHere we apply profile likelihood to determine parameter identifiability of a recent upstream process model. We have investigated the effect of data amount on identifiability and found out that addition of data reduces non-identifiability. The likelihood profiles of non-identifiable parameters were then used to uncover structural model changes. These changes effectively alleviate the remaining non-identifiabilities except for a single parameter out of 21 total parameters.\n\nWe present the first application of profile likelihood to a complete upstream process model.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in light-responsive materials enabled the development of devices to artificially activate tissue with light, and show great potential for use in different types of therapy. Photo-stimulation based on organic semiconductors has recently attracted interest due to their unique set of properties such as biocompatibility, better mechanical match with human tissue, and strong absorption of light in the visible spectrum. Here we show the development of solution processed organic heterojunctions that are able to control the activity of primary neurons in vitro with light. The p-type polymer semiconductor PDCBT and the n-type polymer semiconductor ITIC (also known as non-fullerene acceptor) are simply spin coated on glass substrates forming a bilayer p-n junction with high photo-sensitivity in aqueous electrolytes. Photo-electrochemical measurements reveal that high photo-voltage and photo-current is produced, as a result of a charge transfer between the polymers and oxygen in the electrolyte. The biocompatibility of the proposed materials is addressed with live/dead assays on both primary mouse cortical neurons and human cell lines that are cultured on their surface. We have found that light of low intensity (i.e. 40 mW/cm2) is absorbed, and converted into a cue that triggers action potential on primary cortical neurons directly cultured on glass/PDCBT/ITIC interfaces as proven by patch clamp measurements. The activation of neurons is most likely due to photochemical reactions at the polymer/electrolyte interface that result in hydrogen peroxide, which might lead to modulation of specific ion channels on neurons membrane. Photo-thermal effects are excluded with controlled patch clamp measurements on neurons cultured on plain glass and on photoresist thin films. The profound advantages of low intensity light stimulation, simplified fabrication, and wireless operation pave the way for the integration of these interfaces in multiplex bioelectronic devices for the development of novel light therapy concepts and powerful neuroscience research tools.",

This can be performed by first identifying the cell types in all the subjects and then by performing a DS analysis between the conditions within each cell type. Naive single-cell DS analysis methods that treat cells statistically independent are subject to false positives in the presence of variation between biological replicates, an issue known as the pseudo-replicate bias. While several methods have already been introduced to carry out the statistical testing in multi-subject scRNA-seq analysis, comparisons that include all these methods are currently lacking. Here, we performed a comprehensive comparison of 18 methods for the identification of DS changes between conditions from multi-subject scRNA-seq data. Our results suggest that the pseudo-bulk methods performed generally best. Both pseudo-bulks and mixed models that model the subjects as a random effect were superior compared with the naive single-cell methods that do not model the subjects in any way. While the naive models achieved higher sensitivity than the pseudo-bulk methods and the mixed models, they were subject to a high number of false positives. In addition, accounting for subjects through latent variable modeling did not improve the performance of the naive methods.",

    "abstract": "Minimizers are k-mer sampling schemes designed to generate sketches for large sequences that preserve sufficiently long matches between sequences. Despite their widespread application, learning an effective minimizer scheme with optimal sketch size is still an open question. Most work in this direction focuses on designing schemes that work well on expectation over random sequences, which have limited applicability to many practical tools. On the other hand, several methods have been proposed to construct minimizer schemes for a specific target sequence. These methods, however, require greedy approximations to solve an intractable discrete optimization problem on the permutation space of k-mer orderings. To address this challenge, we propose: (a) a reformulation of the combinatorial solution space using a deep neural network re-parameterization; and (b) a fully differentiable approximation of the discrete objective. We demonstrate that our framework, DO_SCPLOWEEPC_SCPLOWMO_SCPLOWINIMIZERC_SCPLOW, discovers minimizer schemes that significantly outperform state-of-the-art constructions on genomic sequences.",

    "abstract": "Our inability to solve the Variant Interpretation Problem (VIP) has become a bottleneck in the biomedical/clinical application of Next-Generation Sequencing. This situation has favored the development and use of bioinformatics tools for the VIP. However, choosing the optimal tool for our purposes is difficult because of the high variability of clinical contexts across and within countries.\n\nHere, we introduce the use of cost models as a new approach to compare pathogenicity predictors that considers clinical context. An interesting feature of this approach, absent in standard performance measures, is that it treats pathogenicity predictors as rejection classifiers. These classifiers, commonly found in machine learning applications to healthcare, reject low-confidence predictions. Finally, to explore whether context has any impact on predictor selection, we have developed a computational procedure that solves the problem of comparing an arbitrary number of tools across all possible clinical scenarios.\n\nWe illustrate our approach using a set of seventeen pathogenicity predictors for missense variants. Our results show that there is no optimal predictor for all possible clinical scenarios. We also find that considering rejection gives a view of classifiers contrasting with that of standard performance measures.

Their work proved the inadequacy of pseudoreplication approaches for such analysis - This was an important step forward that was conclusively proven by them. A hierarchical single-cell expression simulation approach (hierarchicell) was developed by Zimmerman et al.,1 to generate non-differentially expressed genes upon which performance was evaluated using the type 1 error rate; the proportion of non-differentially expressed genes indicated as differentially expressed by a model. However, evaluating such models on their type 1 or type 2 error rate in isolation is insufficient to determine their true performance - for example, a method with low type 1 error may have a high type 2 error rate. Moreover, because no seed was set for the pseudo-random number generator used in hierarchicell, the different methods evaluated by Zimmerman et al. were done so on different simulated datasets.

    "abstract": "Desiccation tolerance has evolved recurrently in grasses using two unique strategies to mitigate photooxidative damage under anhydrobiosis. The grass Oropetium thomaeum protects and retains chlorophyll, thylakoids, and the photosynthetic apparatus during desiccation (Homoiochlorophyly), while Eragrostis nindensis degrades and resynthesizes these components under desiccation and rehydration (Poikilochlorophyly). Here, we surveyed chromatin architecture and gene expression during desiccation in these two closely related species to identify regulatory dynamics underlying the distinct desiccation tolerance strategies in grasses. In both grasses, we observed a strong association between nearby chromatin accessibility and gene expression in desiccated tissues compared to well-watered, reflecting an unusual chromatin stability under anhydrobiosis. Integration of chromatin accessibility (ATACseq) and expression data (RNAseq) revealed a core desiccation response across these two grasses including many genes with binding sites for the core seed development transcription factor ABI5. O. thomaeum had a unique set of desiccation induced genes and regulatory elements associated with photoprotection, pigment biosynthesis, and response to high light, reflecting its adaptation of homoiochlorophyly. A tandem array of early light induced proteins (ELIPs) had massive shifts in gene expression and chromatin openness under desiccation in only O. thomaeum, and ELIPs acquired a novel desiccation related cis-regulatory motif, reflecting regulatory neofunctionalization during the evolution of desiccation tolerance. Together, our results highlight the complex regulatory and expression dynamics underlying desiccation tolerance in grasses.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic plants are worldwide threats that damage major agricultural crops. To initiate infection, parasitic plants have developed the ability to locate hosts and grow towards them. This ability, called host tropism, is critical for parasite survival, but its underlying mechanism remains mostly unresolved. To characterize host tropism, we used the model facultative root parasite Phtheirospermum japonicum, a member of the Orobanchaceae. Here, we show that strigolactones (SLs) function as host-derived chemoattractants. Chemotropism to SLs is also found in Striga hermonthica, a parasitic member of the Orobanchaceae, but not in non-parasites. Intriguingly, chemotropism to SLs in P. japonicum is attenuated in ammonium ion-rich conditions, where SLs are perceived, but the resulting asymmetrical accumulation of the auxin transporter PIN2 is diminished. P. japonicum encodes putative receptors that sense exogenous SLs, whereas expression of a dominant-negative form reduces its chemotropic ability. We propose a new function for SLs as navigators for parasite roots.",

    "abstract": "Migratory behaviour in birds shows a remarkable variability at species, population and individual levels. Short-distance migrants, in particular, often adopt a partial migratory strategy and tend to have a rather flexible migration schedule which allows them to respond more effectively to extreme environmental variations, like those due to climate change. Weather seasonality and environmental heterogeneity at regional and local scales have been reported as significant factors in the diversification of migratory behaviour for some species of Mediterranean migrants. Relatively few studies, however, investigated the migration patterns of non-passerine birds migrating within this area. In this study we investigated the migratory strategy of the Eurasian Stone-curlew Burhinus oedicnemus using data collected on 40 individuals tagged with geolocators and GPS-GSM tags, belonging to two continental and two Mediterranean populations of the Italian peninsula. The proportion of migrants was significantly higher in continental populations, but we observed a significant variability also within Mediterranean populations. GPS-tagged migrants traveled less than 1000 km, spending the winter within the Mediterranean basin. Continental Stone-curlews i) departed earlier in spring and later in autumn and ii) covered longer distances than those from Mediterranean areas. The speed of migration did not change between seasons for continental birds, while Mediterranean individuals tended to migrate faster in spring. The likelihood of departure for autumn migration of GPS-tagged birds significantly increased when temperatures were near or below 0 {degrees}C suggesting that Stone-curlews tend to delay departure weather conditions worsen abruptly. Thus it can be speculated that the frequency of migratory birds in the considered populations may decrease in the near future due to the effect of global warming in the Mediterranean. This could have a significant effect on the distribution of species throughout the year and should be taken into account when targeting conservation measures.",

    "abstract": "{gamma}-Aminobutyrate (GAB) is the biochemical form of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at physiological pH and functions as an essential neurotransmitter in the vertebrates central nervous system (CNS). Growing evidence suggests that GAB may also mediate intercellular communications to shape various physiological processes, including immune response. Beyond acting as a paracrine signaling molecule, how GAB metabolism is controlled to exert many distinct functions remains elusive. By an integrated analysis of the extracellular metabolome, stable isotope traced metabolic pathway analysis, and metabolic transcriptome, we revealed that GAB is one of the most abundant metabolites produced through glutamine and arginine catabolism in CD4+ T help 17 (TH17) and induced T regulatory (iTreg) cells. GAB functions as a bioenergetic and signaling gatekeeper by reciprocally controlling pro-inflammatory TH17 cell and anti-inflammatory iTreg cell differentiation through distinct mechanisms. The expression of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) funnels GAB, as an anaplerotic substrate, into the TCA cycle to maximize carbon allocation in promoting TH17 cell differentiation. By contrast, the absence of ABAT activities in iTreg cells enables GAB exporting to the extracellular environment and acting as an autocrine signaling metabolite to promote iTreg cell differentiation. Accordingly, genetic or pharmacological ablation of ABAT activity in T cells confers protection against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) pathogenic progression. Conversely, genetic ablation of GABA(A) receptor in T cells deteriorates EAE pathogenic progression. Collectively, our results suggest that the cell-autonomous control exerted by GAB on CD4+ T cell is bimodal and consists of the sequential action of two discrete processes, ABAT-dependent mitochondrial anaplerosis and the receptor-dependent autocrine signaling response, both of which are required for a properly controlled T cell-mediated inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Chitin is a highly abundant polysaccharide in nature and linked to immune recognition of fungal infections and asthma in humans. Ubiquitous in fungi and insects, chitin is absent in mammals and plants and, thus, represents a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP). However, the highly polymeric chitin is insoluble, which potentially hampers recognition by host immune sensors. In plants, secreted chitinases degrade polymeric chitin into diffusible oligomers, which are  fed to innate immune receptors and co-receptors. In human and murine immune cells, a similar enzymatic activity was shown for human chitotriosidase (CHIT1) and oligomeric chitin is sensed via an innate immune receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2. However, a complete system of generating MAMPs from chitin and feeding them into a specific receptor/co-receptor-aided sensing mechanism has remained unknown in mammals. Here, we show that the secreted chitinolytic host enzyme, CHIT1, converts inert polymeric chitin into diffusible oligomers that can be sensed by TLR1-TLR2 co-receptor/receptor heterodimers, a process promoted by the lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and CD14. Furthermore, we observed that Chit1 is induced via the {beta}-glucan receptor Dectin-1 upon direct contact of immortalized human macrophages to the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, whereas the defined fungal secreted aspartyl proteases, Sap2 and Sap6, from C. albicans were able to degrade CHIT1 in vitro. Our study shows the existence of an inducible system of MAMP generation in the human host that enables contact-independent immune activation by diffusible MAMP ligands with striking similarity to the plant kingdom. Moreover, this study highlights CHIT1 as a potential therapeutic target for TLR2-mediated inflammatory processes that are fueled by oligomeric chitin.",

The model must be complex enough to capture the complexity of the data but should be simple enough to not overfit. In phylogenetics, the most common model selection scenario concerns selecting an appropriate substitution and partition model for sequence evolution to infer a phylogenetic tree. Here we explored the impact of substitution model over-parameterization in a Bayesian statistical framework. We performed simulations under the simplest substitution model, the Jukes-Cantor model, and compare posterior estimates of phylogenetic tree topologies and tree length under the true model to the most complex model, the GTR+{Gamma}+I substitution model, including over-splitting the data into additional subsets (i.e., applying partitioned models). We explored four choices of prior distributions: the default substitution model priors of MrBayes, BEAST2 and RevBayes and a newly devised prior choice (Tame). Our results show that Bayesian inference of phylogeny is robust to substitution model over-parameterization but only under our new prior settings. All three default priors introduced biases for the estimated tree length. We conclude that substitution and partition model selection are superfluous steps in Bayesian phylogenetic inference pipelines if well behaved prior distributions are applied.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of fisheries management strategies depends on stock assessment and management actions being carried out at appropriate spatial scales. This requires understanding of spatial and temporal population structure and connectivity, which is challenging in weakly structured and highly connected marine populations. We carried out a population genomics study of the heavily exploited snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) along [~]2,600 km of the Australian coastline, with a focus on Western Australia (WA). We used 10,903 filtered SNPs in 341 individuals from eight locations to characterise population structure and connectivity in snapper across WA and to assess if current spatial scales of stock assessment and management agree with evidence from population genomics. Our dataset also enabled us to investigate temporal stability in population structure as well as connectivity between WA and its nearest, eastern jurisdictional neighbor. As expected for a species influenced by the extensive ocean boundary current in the region, low genetic differentiation and high connectivity was uncovered across WA. However, we did detect strong isolation by distance and genetic discontinuities in the mid-west and south-east. The discontinuities correlate with boundaries between biogeographic regions, influenced by on-shelf oceanography, and the sites of important spawning aggregations. We also detected temporal instability in genetic structure at one of our sites, possibly due to interannual variability in recruitment in adjacent regions. Our results partly contrast with the current spatial management of snapper in WA, highlighting the need for a review. This study supports the value of population genomic surveys in informing the management of weakly-structured and wide-ranging marine fishery resources.",

This study reports experiments carried out in July in Ithaca, NY, USA, in which nymphs (immature aphids) of M. vagabunda were video recorded under a stereo microscope while they encountered pyralid moth larvae in a plastic arena. M. vagabunda nymphs of all instars used their legs to claw moth larvae while pressing their rostrums against the larvae, possibly to pierce the cuticle. Many of the attacking aphids were alatoid nymphs, rather than the specialized first instar soldiers typically observed in Pemphigus species. M. vagabunda nymphs moved in bursts that sometimes became synchronized among several aphids in the same vicinity. These synchronized, rhythmic movements may be anti-predator defense strategies comparable to the collective twitching and kicking response observed in colonies of Aphis nerii and other aphid species. Defensive behaviors by M. vagabunda nymphs may be altruistic fortress defense strategies which maximize inclusive fitness of the clone.\n\nOpen Research statementVideo data are shared publicly on a repository, Zenodo, at this DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5636845",

Using HV Polygenic Scores (HV-PGS), we built genetically adjusted nomograms from participants stratified into the top and bottom 30% of HV-PGS. This shifted the nomograms in the expected directions by [~]100 mm3 (2.3% of the average HV), which equates to 3 years of normal aging.\n\nClinical impact of genetically adjusted nomograms was investigated by comparing 818 subjects from the AD neuroimaging (ADNI) database diagnosed as either cognitively normal (CN), having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimers disease patients (AD). While no significant change in the survival analysis was found for MCI-to-AD conversion, an average of 4% decrease was found in intra-diagnostic-group variance, highlighting the importance of genetic adjustment in untangling phenotypic heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe next-generation sequencing technologies have transformed our understanding of immunoglobulin (Ig) profiles in various immune states. Clonotyping, which groups Ig sequences into B cell clones, is crucial in investigating the diversity of repertoires and changes in antigen exposure. Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for clonotyping, and existing methods are computationally intensive for large sequencing datasets.\n\nResultsTo address this challenge, we introduce YClon, a fast and efficient approach for clonotyping Ig repertoire data. YClon uses a hierarchical clustering approach, similar to other methods, to group Ig sequences into B cell clones in a highly sensitive and specific manner. Notably, our approach outperforms other methods by being more than 30 to 5000 times faster in processing the repertoires analyzed. Astonishingly, YClon can effortlessly handle up to 2 million Ig sequences on a standard laptop computer. This enables in-depth analysis of large and numerous antibody repertoires.\n\nAvailability and implementationYClon was implemented in Python3 and is freely available on GitHub\n\n(https://github.com/jao321/YClon.git)\n\nContact: joaodgervasio@gmail.com, liza@icb.ufmg.br",

    "abstract": "Fossil flowers are essential to infer past angiosperm evolutionary processes. The assignment of fossil flowers to extant clades has traditionally relied on morphological similarity and on apomorphies shared with extant taxa. The use of explicit phylogenetic analyses to establish their affinity has so far remained limited. In this study, we built a comprehensive framework to investigate the phylogenetic placement of 24 exceptionally preserved fossil flowers. For this, we assembled a new species-level dataset of 30 floral traits for 1201 extant species that were sampled to represent the stem and crown nodes of all angiosperm families. We explored multiple analytical approaches to integrate the fossils into the phylogeny, including different phylogenetic estimation methods, topological-constrained analyses, and a total evidence approach combining molecular and morphological data of extant and fossil species. Our results were widely consistent across approaches, with minor differences in the support of fossils at different phylogenetic positions. The placement of some fossils is in agreement with previously suggested relationships, but for others, a new placement is indicated. We also identified fossils that are well constrained within particular extant families, whereas others showed high phylogenetic uncertainty. Finally, we present recommendations for future total evidence analyses, regarding the selection of fossils and appropriate methodologies, and provide some perspectives on how to integrate fossils into the investigation of divergence times and the temporal evolution of morphological traits.",

    "abstract": "Shiga toxin (Stx) producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are foodborne pathogens that release Stx and may develop Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). Stx causes endothelial cell damage and leads to platelets deposition and thrombi formation within the microvasculature. It has been described that Stx activates blood cells and induces the shedding of proinflammatory and prothrombotic microvesicles (MVs) containing the toxin. In this sense, it has been postulated that MVs containing Stx2 (MVs-Stx2+) can contribute to the physiopathology of HUS, allowing Stx to reach the target organs and evading the immune system. In this work, we propose that circulating MVs-Stx2+ can be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of STEC infections and HUS progression. In this regard, we developed a rat HUS model by the intreperitoneal injection of a sublethal dose of Stx2 and observed: decrease in body weight, increase of creatinine and urea levels, decrease of creatinine clearance and histological renal damages. After characterization of renal damages we investigated circulating total MVs and MVs-Stx2+ by flow cytometry at different times after Stx2 injection. Additionally, we evaluated the correlation of biochemical parameters such as creatinine and urea in plasma with MVs-Stx2+. As a result, we found a significant circulation of Mvs-Stx2+ at 96 hours after Stx2 injection, nevertheless no correlation with creatinine and urea plasma levels were detected. Our results suggest that MVs-Stx2+ may be an additional biomarker for the characterization and diagnosis of HUS progression. Further analysis is required in order to validate MVs-Stx2+ as biomarker of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Functional properties of cells, tissues, and organs rely on predictable growth outputs. A shape change in plant cells is determined by properties of a tough cell wall that deforms anisotropically in response to high turgor pressure. This morphogenesis requires tight coordination and feedback controls among cytoskeleton-dependent wall patterning, its material properties, and stresses in the wall. Cortical microtubules bias the mechanical anisotropy of cell wall by defining the trajectories of cellulose synthase motility as they polymerize bundled microfibrils in their wake. Cortical microtubules could locally align and orient relative to cell geometry; however, the means by this orientation occurs is not known. Correlations between the microtubule orientation, cell geometry, and predicted tensile forces are strongly established, and here we simulate how different attributes of tensile force can orient and pattern the microtubule array in the cortex. We implemented a discrete model with three-state transient microtubule behaviors influenced by local mechanical stress in order to probe the mechanisms of stress-dependent patterning. We varied the sensitivity of four types of dynamic behaviors observed on the plus ends of microtubules - growth, shrinkage, catastrophe, and rescue - to local stress and then evaluated the extent and rate of microtubule alignments in a square computational domain. We optimized constitutive relationships between local stress and the plus-end dynamics and employed a biomechanically well-characterized cell wall to analyze how stress can influence the density and orientation of microtubule arrays. Our multiscale modeling approaches predict that spatial variability in stress magnitude and anisotropy mediate mechanical feedback between the wall and organization of the cortical microtubule array.\n\nAuthor SummaryPlant cell growth involve multiple steps and processes. During growth, cell shape changes continuously while responding to external cues from the surroundings. Since growth is mainly driven by pressure, mechanical properties of cell wall are crucial in regulating multiple biological processes that underlie cell expansion and growth. Cell wall assembly is dynamically coupled to the remodeling of subcellular proteins. Experimental evidence has confirmed there exists potential mechanical feedback between wall assembly and protein-protein interactions. However, the actual mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we develop a computational model to study how mechanical stress could affect subcellular protein dynamics or interactions and lead to their reorganization, reminiscent of continuous changes in global pattern and cell morphology. Our results identify key parameters that can respond to external mechanical stimuli at the cellular scale. We also show that a biological stress pattern could induce protein filament organization and bundles that mimic real subcellular structure from experimental images. These computational results could benefit design of experiments for studying and discovering the potential protein candidates that underlie the mechanical feedback between multiple cellular components. In this way, a more systematic understanding about plant cell growth could be achieved, with an integrated theory that combine biology, chemistry, mechanics, and genetics.",

    "abstract": "Summary/AbstractEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a cancer-associated pathogen responsible for 140,000 deaths per year. EBV is also the etiological agent of infectious mononucleosis and is associated with multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, an EBV vaccine could alleviate significant morbidity and mortality. EBV is orally transmitted and has tropism for both epithelial cells and B cells which are present in the oral cavity. Therefore, a prophylactic vaccine would need to prevent infection of both cell types. Passive transfer neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting the viral gH/gL glycoprotein complex prevent experimental EBV infection in humanized mice and rhesus macaques, suggesting that gH/gL is an attractive vaccine candidate. Here, we produced and evaluated the immunogenicity of several nanoparticle immunogens displaying gH/gL with distinct valencies and geometries. After one or two immunizations, all nanoparticles elicited superior binding and neutralizing titers relative to monomeric gH/gL. Antibodies elicited by a computationally designed self-assembling nanoparticle that displays 60 copies of the gH/gL protein conferred protection against a lethal dose of EBV in a humanized mouse challenge model, whereas antibodies elicited by monomeric gH/gL did not. Taken together, these data motivate further development of gH/gL nanoparticle vaccine candidates for EBV.",

    "abstract": "Abiotic environmental conditions play a key role in driving the size and shape of organisms. Quantifying environment-morphology relationships is important not only for understanding the fundamental processes driving phenotypic diversity within and among species (1), but also for predicting how species will respond to ongoing global change (2). Despite a clear set of expectations motivated by ecological theory (3), broad evidence in support of generalizable effects of abiotic conditions, such as temperature (4), on spatial and temporal intraspecific morphological variation has been limited. Using standardized data from over 250,000 captures of 105 landbird species, we assessed intraspecific shifts in bird morphology since 1989 while simultaneously measuring spatial morphological gradients across the North American continent. Across bird species, we found strong spatial and temporal trends in body size, with warmer temperatures associated with smaller body sizes both at more equatorial latitudes and in more recent years. The magnitude of these thermal effects varied both across and within species, with results suggesting it is the warmest, rather than the coldest, temperatures driving both spatial and temporal trends. Across elevation, we found that body size declines as relative wing length increases, likely due to the benefits that longer wings confer for flight in thin air environments. Our results provide support for both existing and new large-scale ecomorphological gradients and highlight how the response of functional tradeoffs to abiotic variation drives morphological change.\n\nSignificance StatementCharacterizing how the size and shape of organisms varies over space and time is key to understanding the processes that create ecological communities and for predicting how species will respond to climate change. Across more than 100 species of North American birds, we show that within species the size and shape of individuals varies substantially across space and time. Warmer temperatures are associated with smaller body sizes, likely due to the importance of body size for thermoregulation. As the climate continues to warm, these species will likely continue to shrink. We also provide the first large-scale evidence of an increase in wing length with elevation, a pattern that could be attributed to thinner air in high elevation environments.",

    "abstract": "Since the integrative analysis of single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements is essential for revealing gene regulation at the single-cell resolution, integrating these two measurements becomes one of the key challenges in computational biology. Because gene expression and chromatin accessibility are measurements from different modalities, no common features can be directly used to guide their integration. Current state-of-the-art methods assume that the number of cell types across the measurements is the same. However, when cell-type heterogeneity exists, they might not generate reliable results. Furthermore, current methods do not have an effective way to select the hyper-parameter under the unsupervised setting. Therefore, applying computational methods to integrate single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements remains difficult.\n\nWe introduce AIscEA - Alignment-based Integration of single-cell gene Expression and chromatin Accessibility - a computational method that integrates single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements using their biological consistency. AIscEA first defines a ranked similarity score to quantify the biological consistency between cell types across measurements. AIscEA then uses the ranked similarity score and a novel permutation test to identify the cell-type alignment across measurements. For the aligned cell types, AIscEA further utilizes graph alignment to align the cells across measurements. We compared AIscEA with the competing methods on several benchmark datasets and demonstrated that AIscEA is more robust to hyper-parameters and can better handle the cell-type heterogeneity problem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AIscEA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods when integrating real-world SNARE-seq and scMultiome-seq datasets in terms of integration accuracy.",

However, distinguishing direct targets from secondary effects and experimental noise can be challenging when confounding signal is present in the background at varying levels.\n\nResultsHere, we present a statistical modeling strategy to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that are primary substrates of target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) mediated by ZSWIM8. This method uses a bi-beta-uniform mixture (BBUM) model to separate primary from background signal components, leveraging the expectation that primary signal is restricted to upregulation and not downregulation upon loss of ZSWIM8. The BBUM model strategy retained the apparent sensitivity and specificity of the previous ad hoc approach but was more robust against outliers, achieved a more consistent stringency, and could be performed using a single cutoff of false discovery rate (FDR).\n\nConclusionsWe developed the BBUM model, a robust statistical modeling strategy to account for background secondary signal in differential expression data. It performed well for identifying primary substrates of TDMD and should be useful for other applications in which the primary regulatory targets are only upregulated or only downregulated.

Interestingly, single mutants were tolerant to drought and the double mutant showed superior tolerance consistent with independent and additive functions. Mutants maintained higher water status during drought and improved recovery and survival after lapse of drought. Notably, diminution of H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation and expression of negative regulators in challenged plants contributes to stress tolerance of the mutants.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDHuntingtons disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene. Immune activation is abundant in the striatum of HD patients. Detection of active microglia at presymptomatic stages suggests that microgliosis is a key early driver of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Recent studies showed that deletion of Tyrobp, a microglial-enriched protein, ameliorates neuronal function in Alzheimers disease amyloid and tauopathy mouse models while decreasing components of the complement subnetwork, thus raising the possibility that Tyrobp deletion can be beneficial for HD.\n\nMETHODSTo test the hypothesis that Tyrobp deficiency would be beneficial in a HD model, we placed the Q175 HD mouse model on a Tyrobp-null background. We characterized these mice with a combination of behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling. Further, we evaluated the Q175 microglia-specific gene signature, with and without Tyrobp, by purifying microglia from these mice for transcriptomics.\n\nRESULTSComprehensive analysis of publicly available transcriptomic HD human data revealed that TYROBP network is overactivated in HD putamen. The Q175 mice showed morphologic microglial activation, reduced levels of post-synaptic density-95 protein and motor deficits at 6 and 9 months of age, all of which were ameliorated on the Tyrobp-null background. Gene expression analysis revealed that lack of Tyrobp in the Q175 model does not prevent the decrease in the expression of striatal neuronal genes but reduces pro-inflammatory pathways that are specifically active in HD human brain. Integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data identified that astrogliosis and complement system pathway were reduced after Tyrobp deletion. Results were further validated by immunofluorescence analysis. Microglia-specific HD gene dysregulation, characterized by overexpression of neuronal genes, was also not corrected by Tyrobp deletion.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur data provide molecular and functional support demonstrating that Tyrobp deletion prevents many of the abnormalities in the Q175 HD mouse model, in the absence of correction of striatal neuronal gene expression, suggesting that the Tyrobp pathway is a potential therapeutic candidate for Huntingtons disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeuronal loss, demyelination, and inflammation in the brains of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) can cause impairment or disability across a range of domains. However, the mapping between severity or location of this brain tissue damage and an individuals impairment remains challenging. Advanced neuroimaging techniques may enable us to better understand the neuropathological or compensatory mechanisms in MS and quantify the link between the brains functional activity and its structural backbone. One recently developed approach uses network control theory to characterize the brains energetic landscape using an individuals structural connectome and brain activity dynamics. While brain activity dynamics have previously been analyzed in MS cohorts, investigating how structural network damage, one of the hallmarks of MS, relates to shifts in activity dynamics has not yet been performed.\n\nAimsWe apply brain activity dynamics analysis and network control theory (NCT) to functional time series and structural connectomes in healthy controls (HC) and pwMS with and without disability and compare the three groups resulting metrics. We also assessed the entropy of the three groups brain activity time series. Our hypotheses were that pwMS with disability would have increased brain state transition energies compared to pwMS without disability and controls, and that greater energies would be related to greater lesion burden and decreased entropy of brain activity.\n\nMaterials and MethodsNinety-nine pwMS and 19 HC were included in our study; individuals underwent MRI, including anatomical, diffusion and resting-state functional scans. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to assess disability; 66 pwMS with EDSS<2 were considered as not having disability. Commonly recurring brain states were identified using k-means clustering of the regional brain activity time series. NCT was used to compute the energy required to transition between each pair of states or to remain in the same state, taking into account an individuals structural connectome. The entropy of brain activity time series was quantified and correlated with overall transition energy and lesion volume. Finally, logistic regression with ridge regularization was used to classify the groups using transition energies and demographics/clinical information and the models feature importance assessed.\n\nResultsSix brain states were identified, including pairs of states with high and low visual (VIS+/-), ventral attention (VAN)+/- and somatomotor (SOM+/-) network activity. Global entropy was negatively correlated with lesion volume (r=-0.20, p=0.03) as was global transition energy (r=-0.18, p=0.04) in pwMS. Smaller transition energies were associated with pwMS without disability, while larger transition energies were associated with pwMS with disability.\n\nDiscussionWe conjecture that functional compensation of brain activity in pwMS without disability results in decreased transition energies between states compared to controls, but, as this mechanism diminishes, transition energies increase and disability occurs. We also conjecture that larger volumes of MS-related lesions result in greater energetic demands to transition between brain states which then leads to lower overall entropy of brain activity.",

To close this knowledge gap, we used a combination of single-cell techniques and functional assays to perform deep immune profiling of human T cell development, focusing on the initial stages of pre-lineage commitment. We identified three thymus-seeding progenitor populations that also have counterparts in the bone marrow. In addition, we found that the human thymus physiologically supports the development of monocytes, dendritic cells, and NK cells, as well as limited development of B cells.

    "abstract": "Inflammasomes are intracellular protein complexes that control proteolytic maturation and secretion of inflammatory interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines and are thus important in host defense. While some inflammasomes are activated simply by binding to pathogen-derived molecules, others, including those nucleated by NLRP3 and NLRP1, have more complex activation mechanisms that are not fully understood. We screened a library of small molecules to identify new inflammasome activators that might shed light on activation mechanisms. In addition to validating dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) inhibitors as NLRP1 activators, we find that clinical tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including imatinib and masitinib activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, these TKIs cause lysosomal swelling and damage, leading to cathepsin-mediated destabilization of myeloid cell membranes and cell lysis. This is accompanied by potassium (K+) efflux, which activates NLRP3. Both lytic cell death and NLRP3 activation but not lysosomal damage induced by TKIs are prevented by the cytoprotectant high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG). Our study establishes a screening method that can be expanded for inflammasome research and immunostimulatory drug development, and provides new insight into immunological off-targets that may contribute to efficacy or adverse effects of TKIs.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA functional small molecule screen identifies imatinib, masitinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors that destabilize myeloid cell lysosomes, leading to cell lysis and K+ efflux-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

Comprised of EBI3 and p28 subunits, IL-27 binds GP130 and IL-27R receptor chains to activate the JAK/STAT signalling cascade. However, how these receptors recognize IL-27 and form a complex capable of phosphorylating JAK proteins remains unclear. Here, we used cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) to solve the structure of the IL-27 receptor recognition complex. Our data show how IL-27 serves as a bridge connecting IL-27R with GP130 to initiate signalling. While both receptors weakly bind the p28 component of the heterodimeric cytokine, EBI3 stabilizes the complex by binding a positively charged surface of IL-27R. We find that assembly of the IL-27 receptor recognition complex is distinct from both IL-12 and IL-6 cytokine families and provides a mechanistic blueprint for tuning IL-27 pleiotropic actions.",

By combining eight novel phages we had isolated, together with commonly used antibiotics, we achieved 100% eradication of clinically isolated C. acnes strains. Using topical phage therapy in an acne mouse model resulted in significantly superior clinical scores, as well as a reduction in neutrophil infiltration compared to the control group.

    "abstract": "Spheroids and organoids are increasingly popular three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models. Spheroid models are more physiologically relevant to a tumour compared to two-dimensional (2D) cultures and organoids are a simplified version of an organ with similar composition. Both can be used in cell migration studies, disease modelling and drug discovery. A drawback of these models is, however, the lack of appropriate analytical tools for high throughput imaging and analysis over a time course. To address this, we have developed an R Shiny app called SpheroidAnalyseR: a simple, fast, effective open-source app that allows the analysis of spheroid or organoid size data generated in a 96-well format. SpheroidAnalyseR processes and analyses datasets of image measurements that can be obtained via a bespoke software, described herein, that automates spheroid imaging and quantification using the Nikon A1R Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. However, templates are provided to enable users to input spheroid image measurements obtained by user-preferred methods. SpheroidAnalyseR facilitates outlier identification and removal followed by graphical visualisation of spheroid measurements across multiple predefined parameters such as time, cell-type and treatment(s). Spheroid imaging and analysis can, thus, be reduced from hours to minutes, removing the requirement for substantial manual data manipulation in a spreadsheet application. The combination of spheroid generation in 96-well ultra-low attachment microplates, imaging using our bespoke software, and analysis using SpheroidAnalyseR toolkit allows high throughput, longitudinal quantification of 3D spheroid growth whilst minimising user input and significantly improving the efficiency and reproducibility of data analysis.

    "abstract": "The transition from mitotic to meiotic cell cycles is a transcriptional event that entails the activation of genes important for meiosis and requires germline-specific retinoic acid (RA) signaling target, Stra8. To identify novel transcription factors underlying mammalian meiotic initiation, we conducted integrative snATAC-seq and scRNA-seq analysis using wild-type and Stra8-deficient mouse testicular cells to map the chromatin accessibility and gene expression landscapes of normal and genetically arrested meiotic initiation. Our results identified a cluster of putative inhibitory transcription factors for meiotic initiation, which we consider \"meiotic inhibitors\". STRA8 binds to the regulatory sequences of these meiotic inhibitors and represses their expression upon meiotic initiation. In Stra8-deficient cells that suffer meiotic initiation arrest, the chromatin accessibility of these meiotic inhibitors is increased, concurrent with their uncontrolled and sustained expression. Among these meiotic inhibitors include KLF4, MAX, and MAZ. Importantly, by analyzing the single cell transcriptomes of human testes, our data show that these putative meiotic inhibitor genes are upregulated in early germ cells from patients with spermatogenic failure. Our study suggests that proper repression of meiotic inhibitors is essential for both mouse and human spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The packaging of DNA into chromatin strongly influences gene regulation. Post-translational modifications of histones, and the proteins that bind to them, alter the accessibility of chromatin and contribute to the activation and repression of genes. The human MRG15 (MORF4- Related Gene on chromosome 15) protein is a conserved chromodomain-containing protein that binds to methylated lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me) and plays important roles in development, genome integrity, and gene regulation. MRG15 affects transcriptional regulation through its interactions with both histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes. MRG-1, its C. elegans homolog, has similarly been shown to have important roles in genomic integrity and development, and has also been shown to co- purify with HDAC complexes. Like MRG15, MRG-1 is predicted to bind to H3K36me through its chromodomain, yet despite mrg-1 mutants displaying developmental and germline phenotypes that overlap with H3K36 methyltransferase mutants, the role of the MRG-1 chromodomain has never been characterized. In this study, we examined meiotic cells lacking H3K36me3 to compare to mrg-1 mutant germ cell phenotypes, and mutated key residues in the MRG-1 chromodomain (CD) to assess its function. The CD mutations cause embryonic lethality but few post-embryonic germline defects, in contrast to mrg-1 deletion mutants which are viable but sterile. The CD mutations therefore disrupt somatic development despite the apparent absence of a requirement for MRG-1 protein in embryogenesis. Furthermore, the CD mutants exhibit a dominant RNAi resistance phenotype that is not seen in other mrg-1 mutant alleles. This suggests that the function of MRG-1, and the chromatin modifying complexes with which it interacts, includes tissue-specific interactions involving different requirements for a functional chromodomain. We propose that the CD mutation disrupts proper guidance of complexes within which it acts, and this guidance defect results in improper HDAC and/or HAT regulation causing an indirect defect in RNAi machinery expression or targeting.",

    "abstract": "R-loop, a three-stranded nucleic acid structure, has been recognized to play pivotal roles in critical physiological and pathological processes. Multiple technologies have been developed to profile R-loops genome-wide, but the existing data suffer from major discrepancies on determining genuine R-loop localization and its biological functions. Here, we experimentally and computationally evaluate eight representative R-loop mapping technologies, and reveal inherent biases and artifacts of individual technologies as key sources of discrepancies. Analyzing signals detected with different R-loop mapping strategies, we note that genuine R-loops predominately form at gene promoter regions, whereas most signals in gene body likely result from structured RNAs as part of repeat-containing transcripts. Interestingly, our analysis also uncovers two classes of R-loops: The first class consists of typical R-loops where the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA binds both the template and non-template strands. By contrast, the second class appears independent of Pol II-mediated transcription and is characterized by RPA binding only in the template strand. These two different classes of RNA:DNA hybrids in the genome suggest distinct biochemical activities involved in their formation and regulation. In sum, our findings will guide future use of suitable technology for specific experimental purposes and the interpretation of R-loop functions.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy resistance is one of the reasons for eye loss in patients with retinoblastoma (RB). RB chemotherapy resistance has been studied in different cell culture models such as WERI RB1. In addition, chemotherapy resistant RB subclones like the etoposide resistant WERI ETOR cell line have been established to improve the understanding of chemotherapy resistance in RB. The objective of this study was to characterize cell line models of an etoposide sensitive WERI RB1 and its etoposide resistant subclone WERI ETOR by proteomic analysis. Subsequently, quantitative proteomic data served for correlation analysis with known drug perturbation profiles. Methodically, WERI RB1 and WERI ETOR were cultured and prepared for quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). This was carried out in a data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode (Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical Mass Spectra, SWATH-MS). The raw SWATH files were processed using neural networks in a library free mode along with machine learning algorithms. Pathway enrichment was performed using the REACTOME pathway resource and correlated to the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collections for functional annotation. Furthermore, a drug connectivity analysis using the L1000 database was used to correlate the mechanism-of-action (MOA) for different anticancer reagents to WERI RB1/WERI ETOR signatures. A total of 4,756 proteins were identified across all samples, showing a distinct clustering between the groups. Of these proteins, 64 were significantly altered (q < 0.05 & log2FC |>2|, 22% higher in WERI ETOR). Pathway analysis revealed an enriched metabolic pathway for \"retinoid metabolism and transport\" in WERI ETOR and for \"sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis\" in WERI RB1. In addition, this study revealed similar protein signatures of topoisomerase inhibitors in WERI ETOR as well as ATPase inhibitors, acetylcholine receptor antagonists and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors in WERI RB1. In this study, WERI RB1 and WERI ETOR were analyzed as a cell line model for chemotherapy resistance in RB using data-independent MS. The global proteome identified activation of \"sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis\" in WERI RB1 and revealed future potential treatment options for etoposide resistance in RB.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe diagnosis of plasma cell neoplasms requires accurate, and ideally precise, percentages. This plasma cell percentage is often determined by visual estimation of CD138-stained bone marrow biopsies and clot sections. While not necessarily inaccurate, estimates are by definition imprecise. For this study, we hypothesized that deep learning can be used to improve precision.\n\nMethodsWe trained a semantic segmentation-based convolutional neural network (CNN) using annotations of CD138+ and CD138- cells provided by one pathologist on small image patches of bone marrow and validated the CNN on an independent test set of images patches using annotations from two pathologists and a non-deep-learning commercial software. Once satisfied with performance, we scaled-up the CNN to evaluate whole slide images (WSIs), and deployed the system as a workflow friendly web application to measure plasma cell percentages using snapshots taken from microscope cameras.\n\nResultsOn validation image patches, we found that the intraclass correlation coefficients for plasma cell percentages between the CNN and pathologist #1, a non-deep learning commercial software and pathologist #1, and pathologists #1 and #2 were 0.975, 0.892, and 0.994, respectively. The overall results show that CNN labels were almost as accurate pathologist labels at a cell-by-cell level. On WSIs from 10 clinical cases, the CNN continued to perform well, and identified two cases where the sign-out pathologist overestimated plasma cell percentages.\n\nConclusionsThe high labeling accuracy of the CNN supports its eventually application as a computational second-opinion tool for the measurement of plasma cell percentages in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Microbial consortia are an exciting alternative for increasing the performances of bioprocesses for the production of complex metabolic products. However, the functional properties of microbial communities remain challenging to control, considering the complex interaction mechanisms occurring between co-cultured microbial species. Indeed, microbial communities are highly dynamic and can adapt to changing environmental conditions through complex mechanisms, such as phenotypic diversification. We focused on stabilizing a co-culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli in continuous cultures. Our preliminary data pointed out that transient diauxic shifts could lead to stable co-culture by providing periodic fitness advantages to the yeast. Based on a computational toolbox called MONCKS (for MONod-type Co-culture Kinetic Simulation), we were able to predict the dynamics of diauxic shift for both species based on a cybernetic approach. This toolbox was further used to predict the frequency of diauxic shift to be applied to reach co-culture stability. These simulations were successfully reproduced experimentally in continuous bioreactors with glucose pulsing. Finally, based on a bet-hedging reporter, we observed that the yeast population exhibited an increased phenotypic diversification process in co-culture compared with mono-culture, suggesting that this mechanism could be the basis of the metabolic fitness of the yeast.",

    "abstract": "The primary motor cortex has been shown to coordinate movement preparation and execution through computations in approximately orthogonal subspaces. The underlying network mechanisms, and the roles played by external and recurrent connectivity, are central open questions that need to be answered to understand the neural substrates of motor control. We develop a recurrent neural network model that recapitulates the temporal evolution of neuronal activity recorded from the primary motor cortex of a macaque monkey during an instructed delayed-reach task. In particular, it reproduces the observed dynamic patterns of covariation between neural activity and the direction of motion. We explore the hypothesis that the observed dynamics emerges from a synaptic connectivity structure that depends on the preferred directions of neurons in both preparatory and movement-related epochs, and we constrain the strength of both synaptic connectivity and external input parameters from data. While the model can reproduce neural activity for multiple combinations of the feedforward and recurrent connections, the solution that requires minimum external inputs is one where the observed patterns of covariance are shaped by external inputs during movement preparation, while they are dominated by strong direction-specific recurrent connectivity during movement execution, in agreement with recent experimental findings on the relationship between motor-cortical and motor-thalamic activity, both before and during movement execution. Our model also demonstrates that the way in which single-neuron tuning properties change over time can explain the level of orthogonality of preparatory and movement-related subspaces.",

Gene expression analyses identified the major off-target tissues as eye-related, cortex-like, and spinal cord-like tissues. For quality control, we developed a qPCR-based test in which each hPSC-derived neuroepithelium was dissected into two tissue-sheets: inner-central sheet for transplantation and outer-peripheral sheet for qPCR to ensure retinal tissue selection. During qPCR, tissue-sheets were stored for 3-4 days using a newly developed preservation method. In a rat tumorigenicity study, no transplant-related adverse events were observed. In retinal degeneration model rats, retinal transplants differentiated into mature photoreceptors and exhibited light responses in electrophysiology assays.

Bacteriophages (phages) are important drivers of population control and diversity in the community, but our understanding of complex microbial communities is halted by biased detection techniques. Metagenomics have provided a method of novel phage discovery independent of in vitro culturing techniques and have revealed a large proportion of understudied phages. Here, five large phage genomes, that were previously assembled in silico from pig faecal metagenomes, are detected and observed directly in their natural environment using a modified phageFISH approach, and combined with methods to decrease bias against large phages. These phages are uncultured with unknown hosts. The specific phages were detected by PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridisation in their original faecal samples as well as across other faecal samples. Co-localisation of bacterial signals and phage signals allowed detection of the different stages of phage life cycle. All phages displayed examples of early infection, advanced infection, burst, and free phages. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of jumbophages in faeces, which were investigated independently of culture, host identification, and size, and based solely on the genome sequence. This approach opens up opportunities for characterisation of novel in silico phages in vivo from a broad range of gut microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "As a member of the family Flaviviridae, the dengue virus is transmitted to humans through mosquito vectors. The virus causes dengue fever with flu-like symptoms, life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome that affects four billion people in 128 countries. It can also be transmitted through atypical routes, such as needle stick injury, vertical transmission, and the receipt of contaminated blood or organs. Although sporadic cases cannot be classified as atypical transmission routes and raise respiratory exposure concerns, the risks remain unclear. Here, we analyzed the respiratory infectivity of the dengue virus in BALB/c suckling and A6 adult mice using the dengue virus serotype 2 and intranasal inoculation. The results showed that the clinical symptoms of intranasally infected mice included excitement, emaciation, malaise, and death, and histopathological changes and viremia dynamics were observed in multiple tissues, including the brain, liver, and spleen. Notably, the DENV serotype 2 showed clear brain tropism after intranasal infection, and viral loads peaked at seven days post-inoculation. Furthermore, the virus was isolated from mouse brains, and the sequence homology between the viral stock and dengue virus isolates was 99.99%. Similar results were observed in adult IFN-/{beta} receptor-deficient mice. Taken together, our results suggest that the DENV serotype 2 can infect suckling mice and adult immune-deficient mice via the nasal route. The results of our study broaden our perception of atypical dengue transmission routes and may help explain dengue virus infections that occur without the presence of mosquito vectors.\n\nImportanceDengue is transmitted mainly via mosquito vectors. Flu-like dengue fever or life-threatening severe dengue threatens four billion people in 128 countries. Non-vector dengue cases have occurred occasionally since 1990. These cases cannot be classified as atypical transmission routes and are suspected to have arisen via sexual or respiratory transmission. Recently, the sexual transmission of dengue has been confirmed in humans. The respiratory infectivity of other members of the Flaviviridae family, such as Zika and Japanese encephalitis viruses, has been determined under experimental conditions. The potential for respiratory infection with the dengue virus has not yet been confirmed. In this study, we analyzed the respiratory infectivity of the dengue virus in suckling mice and adult immunodeficient mice via intranasal inoculation, thereby exploring the potential for respiratory transmission in cases with non-vector dengue infection, especially for patients who were exposed to dengue virus contaminants.",

    "abstract": "The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is globally widespread, but its prevalence varies significantly between and even within countries. Most population genetic studies in P. falciparum focus on regions of high transmission where parasite populations are large and genetically diverse, such as sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding population dynamics in low transmission settings, however, is of particular importance as these are often where drug resistance first evolves. Here, we use the Pacific Coast of Colombia and Ecuador as a model for understanding the population structure and evolution of Plasmodium parasites in small populations harboring low genetic diversity. The combination of low transmission and a high proportion of monoclonal infections means there are few outcrossing events and clonal lineages persist for long periods of time. Yet despite this, the population is evolutionarily labile and has successfully adapted to multiple drug regimes. Using 166 newly sequenced whole genomes, we measure relatedness between parasites, calculated as identity by descent (IBD), and find 17 distinct but highly related clonal lineages, six of which have persisted in the region for at least a decade. This inbred population structure is captured in more detail with IBD than with other common population structure analyses like PCA, ADMIXTURE, and distance-based trees. We additionally use patterns of intra-chromosomal IBD and an analysis of haplotypic variation to explore the role of recombination in spreading drug resistance mutations throughout the region. Two genes associated with chloroquine resistance, crt and aat1, show evidence of hard selective sweeps, while selection appears soft and/or incomplete at three other key resistance loci (dhps, mdr1, and dhfr). Overall, this work highlights the strength of IBD analyses for studying parasite population structure and resistance evolution in regions of low transmission, and emphasizes that drug resistance can evolve and spread in extremely small populations, as will occur in any region nearing malaria elimination.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhylogenetic inference based on genomic structural variations, that manipulate the gene order and content of whole chromosomes, promises to inform a more comprehensive understanding of evolution. The first challenge in using such data, the incompleteness of available de novo assemblies, is easing as long read technologies enable (near-)complete genome assembly, but methodological challenges remain. To obtain the input to rearrangement-based inference methods, we need to detect syntenic blocks of orthologous sequences, a task that can be accomplished in many ways, none of which are obviously preferable. In this paper, we use 94 reference quality genomes of primarily Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates as a benchmark to evaluate these methods. The clonal nature of Mtb evolution, the manageable genome sizes, along with substantial levels of structural variation make this an ideal benchmarking dataset. We test several methods for detecting homology and obtaining syntenic blocks, and two methods for inferring phylogenies, comparing them to the standard method that uses substitutions for inferring the tree. We find that not only the choice of methods but also their parameters can impact results, especially among branches with lower support. In particular, a method based on an encoding of adjacencies applied to Cactus-defined blocks was fully compatible with the highly supported branches of the substitution-based tree. Thus, we were able to combine the two trees to obtain a supertree with high resolution utilizing both SNPs and rearrangements. Furthermore, we observed that the results were much less affected by the choice of the tree inference method than by the method used to determine the underlying syntenic blocks. Overall, our results indicate that accurate trees can be inferred using genome rearrangements, but the choice of the methods for inferring the homology matters and requires care.",

While CRISPR-related technologies have shown great promise and a fast pace of innovation, a better understanding of standards and methods for quality assessment of CRISPR screen results is crucial to guide technology development and application.

    "abstract": "The oxidation of methionine side chains has emerged as an important posttranslational modification of proteins. A diverse array of low-throughput and targeted studies have suggested that the oxidation of methionine residues in select proteins can have diverse impacts on cell physiology, ranging from detrimental effects on protein structure and stability to functional roles in cell signaling. Despite its importance, the large-scale investigation of methionine oxidation in a complex matrix, such as the cellular proteome, has been historically hampered by technical limitations. Herein we report a methodology, Methionine Oxidation by Blocking (MobB), that allows for accurate and precise quantification of low levels of methionine oxidation typically observed in vivo. To demonstrate the utility of this methodology, we applied MobB to the brain tissues of young (6 m.o.) and old (20 m.o.) mice and identified over 280 novel sites for in vivo methionine oxidation. We further demonstrated that oxidation stoichiometries for specific methionine residues are highly consistent between individual animals and methionine sulfoxides are enriched in clusters of functionally related gene products including membrane and extracellular proteins. However, we did not detect significant changes in methionine oxidation in brains of old mice. Our results suggest that under normal in vivo conditions methionine oxidation is a biologically regulated process rather than a result of stochastic chemical damage.",

Three key characteristics define heme overdrive, i.e., cancer universality, cancer essentiality and cancer specificity. While heme overdrive is absent in diverse differentiated cells or somatic stem cells, it is present in hundreds of cancers, and is delineated in patient-derived tumor progenitor cells by single cell RNAseq. The only exception to heme overdrive in normal tissues is identified in preimplantation human embryos, where heme overdrive likely links to embryonic omnipotency. Among the major drivers are proteins involved in biosynthesis of heme intermediates (hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD)) and heme trafficking (FLVCR1). CRISPR/Cas9 editing to engineer leukemia cells with impaired heme biosynthesis steps confirmed our whole genomic data analyses that heme overdrive is linked to oncogenic states and cellular differentiation.

The embryo-derived root apical meristem is organized around a group of infrequently dividing cells, the quiescent centre, that maintains the stem cells, organizes growth along two axes and owing to its resistance to 3ic stress can replace damaged stem cells. In most cases, lateral roots post-embryonically branch off the primary and establish a new root meristem which organization is identical to the primary root one. The cellular and molecular processes underpinning the emergence of new stem cell niches are not well known. Here, we characterize the de novo establishment of the root apical meristem in lateral roots. While the position of the new stem cell niche is set early during morphogenesis, its cellular layout, unique gene expression profile and mitotic quiescence are only acquired after emergence concomitant to the establishment of two diverging growth axis. Our results show that the intertwined attributes of the mature root stem cell niche are progressively acquired during lateral root formation, and support a model in which the position of the stem cell niche emerges from the establishment of diverging growth axis.\n\nHighlightAnalyze of the ontogeny of the quiescent center during lateral root ontogeny reveal its late formation and supports that its emergence results from the establishment of two diverging growth axis.",

    "abstract": "SummaryO_LIGenetic studies have demonstrated that NPR1 is the key positive regulator of salicylic acid (SA)-induced PR-1 gene induction and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In Arabidopsis, family members NPR1 to NPR4 share domain architecture.\nC_LIO_LIYeast hybrid assays were used to explore biochemical capabilities of NPR1 to NPR4.\nC_LIO_LIAll NPR1 to NPR4 are responsive to SA. SA perception proceeds via the conserved arginine embedded in a C-terminal LENRV-like motif. Clade 2 proteins NPR3 and NPR4 perceive SA directly, while clade 1 members NPR1 and NPR2 require interaction with partner proteins NIMIN1/NIMIN2 and TGA factors, respectively, to enable SA sensing. Intriguingly, NPR3 is considerably more sensitive to the synthetic analog 3,5-dichloroanthranilic acid than to SA, and all NPR1 to NPR4 are able to sense the microbial metabolite 6-methyl SA.\nC_LIO_LIWe suggest that the plant{acute}s ability to track SA and phenolic acid derivatives through NPR proteins has evolved to support diverse defense signaling outputs that are activated in parallel by agonists which may be of microbial or plant origin. In this line, NPR1-NIMIN2/NIMIN1 complex is the prime receptor for SA synthesized by plants in response to microbial attack, while NPR3 induces defense different from SAR primarily via unrecognized signal molecules.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Exposure to pesticides in humans increases the risk of Parkinsons disease (PD), but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. To elucidate these pathways, we dosed C57BL/6J mice with a combination of the pesticides maneb and paraquat (MNPQ). Behavioral analysis revealed motor deficits consistent with PD. Single cell RNA sequencing of substantia nigra pars compacta revealed both cell-type specific genes and genes expressed differentially between pesticide and control, including Fam241b, Emx2os, Bivm, Gm1439, Prdm15 and Rai2. Neurons had the largest number of significant differentially expressed genes, but comparable numbers were found in astrocytes and less so in oligodendrocytes. In addition, network analysis revealed enrichment in functions related to the extracellular matrix. These findings emphasize the importance of support cells in pesticide-induced PD and refocus our attention away from neurons as the sole agent of this disorder.",
