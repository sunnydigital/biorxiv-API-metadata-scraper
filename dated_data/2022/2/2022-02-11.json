    "abstract": "Protein cages are attractive as molecular scaffolds for the fundamental study of enzymes and metabolons, and for the creation of biocatalytic nanoreactors for in vitro and in vivo use. Virus-like particles (VLPs) such as those derived from the P22 bacteriophage capsid protein make versatile self-assembling protein cages and can be used to encapsulate a broad range of protein cargos. In vivo encapsulation of enzymes within VLPs requires fusion to the coat protein or a scaffold protein. However, the expression level, stability and activity of cargo proteins can vary upon fusion. Moreover, it has been shown that molecular crowding of enzymes inside virus-like particles can affect their catalytic properties. Consequently, testing of numerous parameters is required for production of the most efficient nanoreactor for a given cargo enzyme. Here we present a set of acceptor vectors that provide a quick and efficient way to build, test and optimise cargo loading inside P22 virus-like particles. We prototyped the system using yellow fluorescent protein then applied it to mevalonate kinases, a key enzyme class in the industrially important terpene (isoprenoid) synthesis pathway. Different mevalonate kinases required considerably different approaches to deliver maximal encapsulation as well as optimal kinetic parameters, demonstrating the value of being able to rapidly access a variety of encapsulation strategies. The vector system described here provides an approach to optimise cargo enzyme behaviour in bespoke P22 nanoreactors. This will facilitate industrial applications as well as basic research on nanoreactor-cargo behaviour.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/479872v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172138corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@616de5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75ea19org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c19cd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The vast expansion from mossy fibers to cerebellar granule cells produces a neural representation that supports functions including associative and internal model learning. This motif is shared by other cerebellum-like structures, including the insect mushroom body, electrosensory lobe of electric fish, and mammalian dorsal cochlear nucleus, and has inspired numerous theoretical models of its functional role. Less attention has been paid to structures immediately presynaptic to granule cell layers, whose architecture can be described as a \"bottleneck\" and whose functional role is not understood. We therefore develop a general theory of cerebellum-like structures in conjunction with their afferent pathways. This theory predicts the role of the pontine relay to cerebellar cortex and the glomerular organization of the insect antennal lobe. It also reconciles theories of nonlinear mixing with recent observations of correlated granule cell activity. More generally, it shows that structured compression followed by random expansion is an efficient architecture for flexible computation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe use of rumen microbial community (RMC) profiles to predict methane emissions has driven interest in ruminal DNA preservation and extraction protocols that can be processed cheaply while also maintaining or improving DNA quality for RMC profiling. Our standard approach for preserving rumen samples, as defined in the Global Rumen Census (GRC), requires time-consuming pre-processing steps of freeze drying and grinding prior to international transportation and DNA extraction. This impedes researchers unable to access sufficient funding or infrastructure. To circumvent these pre-processing steps, we investigated three methods of preserving rumen samples for subsequent DNA extraction, based on existing lysis buffers Tris-NaCl-EDTA-SDS (TNx2) and guanidine hydrochloride (GHx2), or 100% ethanol.\n\nResultsRumen samples were collected via stomach intubation from 151 sheep at two time-points two weeks apart. Each sample was separated into four subsamples and preserved using the three preservation methods and the GRC method (n = 4x302). DNA was extracted and sequenced using Restriction Enzyme-Reduced Representation Sequencing to generate RMC profiles. Differences in DNA yield, quality and integrity, and sequencing metrics were observed across the methods (p < 0.0001). Ethanol exhibited poorer quality DNA (A260/A230 < 2) and more failed samples compared to the other methods. Samples preserved using the GRC method had smaller relative abundances in gram-negative genera Anaerovibrio, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Selenomonas, and Succiniclasticum, but larger relative abundances in the majority of 56 additional genera compared to TNx2 and GHx2. However, log10 relative abundances across all genera and time-points for TNx2 and GHx2 were on average consistent (R2 > 0.99) but slightly more variable compared to the GRC method. Relative abundances were moderately to highly correlated (0.68 {+/-} 0.13) between methods for samples collected within a time-point, which was greater than the average correlation (0.17 {+/-} 0.11) between time-points within a preservation method.\n\nConclusionsThe two modified lysis buffers solutions (TNx2 and GHx2) proposed in this study were shown to be viable alternatives to the GRC method for RMC profiling in sheep. Use of these preservative solutions reduces cost and improves throughput associated with processing and sequencing ruminal samples. This development could significantly advance implementation of RMC profiles as a tool for breeding ruminant livestock.",

    "abstract": "An organisms phenotypes and fitness often depend on interactive effects of its genome (Ghost), microbiome (Gmicrobe), and environment (E). These G xG, G xE, and G xG xE effects fundamentally shape host-microbiome (co)evolution and may be widespread, but are rarely compared within a single experiment. We collected and cultured Lemna minor (duckweed) and its associated microbiome from 10 sites across an urban-to-rural ecotone. We factorially manipulated host genotype and microbiome in two environments (low and high zinc, an urban aquatic stressor) in an experiment with 200 treatments: 10 host genotypes x 10 microbiomes x 2 environments. Host genotype explained the most variation in L. minor fitness and traits, while microbiome effects depended on host genotype (G xG) or environment (G xE). Hosts had higher fitness and microbes grew fastest when tested microbiomes more closely matched field microbiomes, suggesting some local adaptation between hosts and their microbiota. High microbiome similarity also led to more predictable host trait expression. In contrast, although zinc decreased host fitness, we observed no local adaptation of urban duckweed or microbes to high-zinc conditions. Thus, we found that host fitness and trait expression are contingent on microbiome composition, with implications for microbiome engineering and host-microbiome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by loss of function variants in the NF2 gene, which codes for the protein Merlin, and characterized by the development of multiple tumours of the nervous system. The clinical presentation of the disease is variable and related to the type of the inherited germline variant. Here, we tested if PMOs could be used to correct the splice signalling caused by variants at +/-13 within the intron-exon boundary region. Here we show that the PMOs designed for these variants do not constitute a therapeutic approach. Furthermore, we evaluated the use of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) to reduce the severity of the effects of NF2 truncating variants with the aim of generating milder hypomorphic isoforms in vitro through the induction of the in-frame deletion of the exon-carrying variant. We were able to specifically induce the skipping of exons 4, 8 and 11 maintaining the NF2 gene reading frame at cDNA level. Only the skipping of exon 11 produced a hypomorphic Merlin (Merlin-e11), able to partially rescue the observed phenotype in primary fibroblast cultures from NF2 patients, being encouraging for the treatment of patients harbouring truncating variants located in exon 11.",

    "abstract": "The {varepsilon}4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest and most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). While the mechanism of conveyed risk is incompletely understood, promotion of inflammation, dysregulated metabolism, and protein misfolding and aggregation are contributors to accelerating disease. Here we determined the concurrent effects of systemic metabolic changes and brain inflammation in young (3-month-old) and aged (18-month-old) male and female mice carrying the APOE4 gene. Using functional metabolic assays alongside multivariate modeling of hippocampal cytokine levels, we found that brain cytokine signatures are predictive of systemic metabolic outcomes, independent of AD proteinopathies. Male and female mice each produce different cytokine signatures as they age and as their systemic metabolic phenotype declines, and these signatures are APOE genotype dependent. Ours is the first study to identify a quantitative and predictive link between systemic metabolism and specific pathological cytokine signatures in the brain. Our results highlight the effects of APOE4 beyond the brain and suggest the potential for bi-directional influence of risk factors in the brain and periphery.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=123 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/480074v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5865d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@185a0e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d2e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b27318_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Syndrome of Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess (SAME) is a hypertensive disorder caused by deficiency of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. Blood pressure is directly influenced by dietary salt intake, but the causes of salt-sensitivity are not fully resolved. We modelled SAME in Fischer 344 rats, using zinc finger nuclease targeting of the Hsd11b2 gene. The F344 genetic background showed modest salt sensitivity: blood pressure increased by [~]6mmHg when diet was switched from control (0.3% Na) to high salt (3% Na) diet. Homozygous knockout (Hsd2-/-) rats exhibited severe hypertension on control diet (mean arterial blood pressure of [~]180 mmHg compared to [~]115 mmHg in wild-types) and displayed no dipping in blood pressure in the inactive/sleep phase. They also displayed reduced heart rate (339 bpm versus 384 bpm in F344 controls). Low salt diet (0.03% Na) caused a dramatic fall in Hsd2-/- blood pressure (to [~]141mmHg), restoration of robust circadian variation in blood pressure, and an increase in heart rate (to 364bpm). This was mirrored by a restoration of circadian variation in the Poincare plot descriptor, SD1, suggesting involvement of parasympathetic dysfunction in the non-dipping phenotype. Alpha adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin treatment resulted in a further decrease in blood pressure (to [~]124mmHg), which blunted circadian rhythm, together with an increase in heart rate (to [~]394bpm). This rat model of human hypertension reveals clear links between dietary salt, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and the non-dipping blood pressure phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Of American origin, a wide diversity of Xylella fastidiosa strains belonging to different subspecies have been reported in Europe since 2013 and its discovery in Italian olive groves. Strains from the subspecies multiplex (ST6 and ST7) were first identified in France in 2015 in urban and natural areas. To trace back the most probable scenario of introduction in France, the molecular evolution rate of this subspecies was estimated at 3.2165 x 10-7 substitutions per site per year, based on heterochronous genome sequences collected worldwide. This rate allowed the dating of the divergence between French and American strains in 1987 for ST6 and in 1971 for ST7. The development of a new VNTR-13 scheme allowed tracing the spread of the bacterium in France, hypothesizing an American origin. Our results suggest that both sequence types were initially introduced and spread in Provence-Alpes-Cote dAzur (PACA); then they were introduced in Corsica in two waves from the PACA bridgehead populations.",

    "abstract": "The cytosolic molecular chaperone Hsp90 is essential for eukaryotic life1, 2. It is involved in multiple branches of proteostasis2, 3, and as a molecular capacitor in morphological evolution4. Although reduced Hsp90 levels cause phenotypic variations5, 6 and correlate with aging7, whether eukaryotic cells and organisms can tune the basal Hsp90 protein levels to alleviate physiologically accumulated stress is unknown. To begin to explore this question, we investigated whether and how mice adapt to the deletion of three out of four alleles encoding cytosolic Hsp90, one Hsp90{beta} allele being the only remaining one. While the vast majority of such mouse embryos die during gestation, survivors apparently manage to increase their Hsp90{beta} protein to at least wild-type levels. Further mechanistic studies revealed an internal ribosome entry site in the 5UTR of the Hsp90{beta} mRNA allowing translational reprogramming to compensate for the genetic loss of Hsp90 alleles and in response to stress. We found that the minimum amount of total Hsp90 that is required to support viability of mammalian cells and organisms is 50-70% of what is normally there. Those that fail to maintain a threshold level are subject to accelerated senescence, proteostatic collapse, and ultimately death. Therefore, considering that Hsp90 levels can be reduced [&ge;]100-fold in the unicellular budding yeast, critical threshold levels of Hsp90 have been markedly increased during eukaryotic evolution. The incompressible part of the steady-state levels of Hsp90 may have increased to accommodate the ever-growing complexity of the proteome8 on the path towards mammals.",

Our custom instrumentation and software enable measurement of the amide hydrogen exchange rates of wild-type alpha-synuclein at amino acid resolution under physiological conditions, mimicking those in the extracellular, intracellular, and lysosomal compartments of cells. We characterised the aggregation kinetics and morphology of the resulting fibrils and correlate these with structural changes in the monomer. Our findings reveal that the C-terminal residues of alpha-synuclein are driving its nucleation and thus its aggregation. Furthermore, the entire NAC region and specific other residues strongly promoted elongation of fibrils.

    "abstract": "Pathogenic bacteria use a broad range of virulence factors to thrive within their host. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a gram-negative enteropathogen in humans, utilises a Type III secretion system to overcome the hosts innate immune response. A global regulator previously shown to be essential for virulence in Y. pseudotuberculosis is RpoN. We show here that a strain lacking RpoN has a severely reduced capacity to secrete Yop effectors. This strain has a substantially reduced expression of genes encoding structural components of the secretion apparatus, the ysc operons, while expression of genes encoding effectors and translocators is less affected. We show that RpoN regulates a complex network, where one part is suggested to contribute to inducing Type III secretion via the enhancer-binding protein GlrR/RpoN regulon. By analogy, during inducement of Type III secretion, RpoN has a positive effect on expression of the sigma factor RpoE, which also is known to act downstream of GlrR. Interestingly, we found putative RpoE binding sites upstream of the ysc operons, and also a partial rescue of Yop secretion in the rpoN mutant strain by overexpression of RpoE. Our findings suggest that the RpoN-mediated effect on expression of type III genes involves a sigma factor hierarchy, where RpoN via RpoE contributes to inducing Type III secretion.",

    "abstract": "JNK signaling plays a critical role in both tumor promotion and tumor suppression. Here, we identified clustered microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-306 and miR-79 as novel tumor-suppressor miRNAs that specifically eliminate JNK-activated tumors in Drosophila. While showing no significant effect on normal tissue growth, miR-306 and miR-79 strongly suppressed growth of multiple tumor models including malignant tumors caused by Ras activation and cell polarity defects. Mechanistically, these miRNAs commonly target the mRNA of an E3 ubiquitin ligase Drosophila ring finger protein 146 (dRNF146). We found that DRNF146 promotes degradation of tankyrase (Tnks), an ADP-ribose polymerase that promotes JNK activation in a non-canonical manner. Thus, downregulation of dRNF146 by miR-306 and miR-79 leads to hyper-enhancement of JNK activation. Our data show that, while JNK activity is essential for tumor growth, elevation of miR-306 or miR-79 overactivate JNK signaling to the lethal level via non-canonical JNK pathway and thus eliminate tumors, providing a new miRNA-based strategy against cancer.",

Memory of inositol starvation in budding yeast involves a positive feedback loop between transcription factor-dependent interaction with the nuclear pore complex and histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). While H3K4me2 is essential for recruitment of RNAPII and faster reactivation, RNAPII is not required for H3K4me2. Unlike RNAPII-dependent H3K4me2 associated with transcription, RNAPII-independent H3K4me2 requires Nup100, SET3C, the Leo1 subunit of the Paf1 complex and, upon degradation of an essential transcription factor, is inherited through multiple cell cycles. The writer of this mark (COMPASS) physically interacts with the potential reader (SET3C), suggesting a molecular mechanism for the spreading and re-incorporation of H3K4me2 following DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) represent genomic components of retroviral origin that are found integrated in the genomes of various species of vertebrates. These genomic elements have been widely characterized in model organisms and humans. However, composition and abundances of ERVs have not been categorized fully in all domestic animals. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies, development of bioinformatics tools, availability of genomic databases and molecular cytogenetic techniques have revolutionized the exploration of the genome structure. Here, we investigated the nature, abundance, organization and assembly of ERVs and complete genomes of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data from two Iraqi domestic sheep breeds. We used graph-based read clustering (RepeatExplorer), frequency analysis of short motifs (k-mers), alignment to reference genome assemblies and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Three classes of ERVs were identified with the total genomic proportions of 0.55% from all analyzed whole genome sequencing raw reads, while FISH to ovine metaphase chromosomes exhibited abundant centromeric to dispersed distribution of these ERVs. Furthermore, the complete genomes of JSRV of two Iraqi sheep breeds were assembled and phylogenetically clustered with the known enJSRV proviruses in sheep worldwide. Characterization of partial and complete sequences of mammalian ERVs is valuable to provide insights into the genome landscape, to help with future genome assemblies and to identify potential sources of disease when ERVs become active.",

Recently, T. harzianum IOC-3844 (Th3844) and T. harzianum CBMAI-0179 (Th0179) demonstrated great potential in the enzymatic conversion of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars. Herein, we performed whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the Th3844 and Th0179 strains. To assess the genetic diversity within the genus Trichoderma, the results of both strains were compared with strains of T. atroviride CBMAI-00020 (Ta0020) and T. reesei CBMAI-0711 (Tr0711). The sequencing coverage value of all genomes evaluated in this study was higher than that of previously reported genomes for the same species of Trichoderma. The resulting assembly revealed total lengths of 40 Mb (Th3844), 39 Mb (Th0179), 36 Mb (Ta0020), and 32 Mb (Tr0711). A genome-wide phylogenetic analysis provided details on the relationships of the newly sequenced species with other Trichoderma species. Structural variants revealed genomic rearrangements among Th3844, Th0179, Ta0020, and Tr0711 relative to the T. reesei QM6a reference genome and showed the functional effects of such variants. In conclusion, the findings presented herein allow the visualization of genetic diversity in the evaluated strains and offer opportunities to explore such fungal genomes in future biotechnological and industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Both upregulation and downregulation by cis-regulatory elements help establish precise gene expression. Our understanding of how elements repress transcriptional activity is far more limited than activating elements. To address this gap, we characterized RE1, a group of transcriptional silencers bound by REST, on a genome-wide scale using an modified massively parallel reporter assay (MPRAduo). MPRAduo empirically defined a minimal binding strength of REST required for silencing (REST m-value), above which multiple cofactors colocalize and act to directly silence transcription. We identified 1,500 human variants that alter RE1 silencing and found their effect sizes are predictable when they overlap with REST binding sites above the m-value. In addition, we demonstrate that non-canonical REST binding motifs exhibit silencer function only if they precisely align two half sites with specific spacer length. Our results show mechanistic insights into RE1 silencer which allows us to predict its activity and effect of variants on RE1, providing a paradigm for performing genome-wide functional characterization of transcription factors binding sites.",

Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy active structure of the wild-type arginine-vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) in complex with {beta}-arrestin1. It reveals an atypical position of {beta}-arrestin1 compared to previously described GPCR-arrestin assemblies, associated with an original V2R/{beta}-arrestin1 interface involving all receptor intracellular loops. Phosphorylated sites of the V2R C-terminus are clearly identified and interact extensively with the {beta}-arrestin1 N-lobe, in agreement with structural data obtained with chimeric or synthetic systems.

    "abstract": "Kinesins are a superfamily of molecular motors that undertake ATP-dependent microtubule-based movement or regulate microtubule dynamics. Plasmodium species, which cause malaria and kill hundreds of thousands annually, encode 8-9 kinesins in their genomes. Of these, two - kinesin-8B and kinesin-8X -are canonically classified as kinesin-8s, which in other eukaryotes typically modulate microtubule dynamics. Unexpectedly, Plasmodium kinesin-8B is required for development of the flagellated male gamete in the mosquito host, and its absence completely blocks parasite transmission. To understand the molecular basis of kinesin-8Bs essential role, we characterised the in vitro properties of the kinesin-8B motor domains from P. berghei and P. falciparum. Both motors drive plus-end directed ATP-dependent microtubule gliding, but also catalyse ATP-dependent microtubule depolymerisation. We determined the microtubule-bound structures of these motors using cryo-electron microscopy. P. berghei and P. falciparum kinesin-8B exhibit a very similar mode of microtubule interaction, in which Plasmodium-distinct sequences at the microtubule-kinesin interface influence motor function. Intriguingly, however, P. berghei kinesin-8B exhibits a non-canonical structural response to ATP analogue binding such that neck linker docking is not induced. Nevertheless, the neck linker region is absolutely required for motility and depolymerisation activities of these motors. Taken together, these data suggest that the mechanochemistry of Plasmodium kinesin-8Bs has been functionally tuned to efficiently contribute to flagella formation.",

Circularization of RNA has been demonstrated as a means to improve persistence, however simple and scalable approaches to achieve this are lacking. Utilizing autocatalytic RNA circularization, here we engineer in situ circularized RNAs (icRNAs). This approach enables icRNA delivery as simple linear RNA that is circularized upon delivery into the cell, thus making them compatible with routine synthesis, purification, and delivery formulations. We confirmed extensive protein translation from icRNAs both in vitro and in vivo and explored their utility in three contexts: first, we delivered the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike protein in vivo as icRNAs and showed corresponding induction of humoral immune responses; second, we demonstrated robust genome targeting via zinc finger nucleases delivered as icRNAs; and third, to enable compatibility between persistence of expression and immunogenicity, we developed a novel long range multiplexed (LORAX) protein engineering methodology to screen progressively deimmunized Cas9 proteins, and demonstrated efficient genome and epigenome targeting via their delivery as icRNAs. We anticipate this highly simple and scalable icRNA methodology could have broad utility in basic science and therapeutic applications.",

Here we investigated whether a targeted delivery of NT3 to lumbar and thoracic motor neurons 48 hours following a severe contusive injury aids locomotive recovery in rats. AAV1-NT3 was injected into the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and rectus abdominus muscles 48-hours following trauma, persistently elevating serum levels of the neurotrophin. NT3 improved trunk stability, accuracy of stepping during skilled locomotive tasks, and alternation of the hindlimbs during swimming, but it had no effect on gross locomotion function in the open field. The number of vGlut1+ (likely proprioceptive afferent) boutons on gastrocnemius -motor neurons was increased after injury but normalised following NT3 treatment suggestive of a mechanism in which the functional effects may be mediated through proprioceptive feedback. Ex vivo MRI revealed substantial loss of grey and white matter at the lesion epicentre but no effect of delayed NT3 treatment to induce neuroprotection or prevent secondary damage. Spasms and hyperreflexia were not reliably induced in this severe injury model suggesting a more complex anatomical or physiological cause to their induction.

    "abstract": "Autophagy provides nutrients during starvation and eliminates detrimental cellular components. However, accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy is not merely a housekeeping process. Here, we show that the protein AuTophaGy 5 (ATG5) functions in neurons to regulate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of a synapse-confined proteome. This function of ATG5 is independent of bulk turnover of synaptic proteins and requires the targeting of PKA inhibitory R1 subunits to autophagosomes. Neuronal loss of ATG5 causes synaptic accumulation of PKA R1, which sequesters the PKA catalytic subunit and diminishes the cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation of postsynaptic cytoskeletal proteins mediating AMPAR trafficking. Glutamatergic neurons-confined ATG5 deletion augments AMPAR-dependent excitatory neurotransmission and causes the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice. Our findings identify a novel role of autophagy in regulating PKA signaling at glutamatergic synapses and suggest the PKA as a target for restoration of synaptic function in neurodegenerative conditions with autophagy dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The phenotype of an organism results from its genotype and the influence of the environment throughout development. Even when using animals of the same genotype, independent studies may test animals of different phenotypes, resulting in poor replicability due to genotype-by-environment interactions 1-4. Thus, genetically defined strains of mice may respond differently to experimental treatments depending on their rearing environment 5. However, the extent of such phenotypic plasticity and its implications for the replicability of research findings have remained unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which common environmental differences between rearing facilities modulate the phenotype of genetically homogeneous (inbred) mice. We conducted a comprehensive multi-center study, where inbred mice from the same breeding stock were reared in five different facilities throughout early life and adolescence, before being transported to a single test laboratory. We found persistent effects of rearing facility on the composition and heterogeneity of the gut microbial community. These effects were paralleled by persistent differences in body weight and in the behavioural phenotype of the mice. Furthermore, we show that common variation among rearing facilities is strong enough to influence epigenetic patterns in neurons at the level of chromatin organization. We detected changes in chromatin organization in the regulatory regions of genes involved in nucleosome assembly, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity and regulation of behavior. Our findings demonstrate that common environmental differences between rearing facilities may produce facility-specific phenotypes, from the molecular to the behavioural level. We expect our findings to stimulate further research into the mechanisms and drivers of these epigenetic changes mediated by the laboratory environment. Furthermore, they highlight an important limitation of inferences from single-laboratory studies and a need to account for the animals environmental background in study design to produce robust and replicable findings.",

    "abstract": "The advent of multimodal brain atlases promises to accelerate discoveries in neuroscience by offering in silico queries of cell types, connectivity and gene expression in regions of interest. We employed multiplexed fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to generate expression maps for an initial set of 200 marker genes across the larval zebrafish brain. The data were registered to the Max Planck Zebrafish Brain (mapzebrain) atlas, thus allowing co-visualization of gene expression patterns, single-neuron tracings, transgenic lines and anatomical segmentations. Additionally, brain activity maps of freely swimming larvae were generated at single-cell resolution using HCR labeling of the immediate-early gene cfos and integrated into the atlas. As a proof of concept, we identified a novel class of cerebellar eurydendroid cells that express calb2a, project to the hypothalamus and are activated in animals that have recently ingested food. Thus, a cellular-resolution gene expression atlas will not only help with rapid identification of marker genes for neuronal populations of interest, but also bridge the molecular and circuit levels by anchoring genetic information to functional activity maps and synaptic connectivity.",

We use a simulation-driven pipeline to design a magnetic separation module to apply an exponentially increasing magnetic force to capture magnetically tagged non-basophils flowing through a microtubing sandwiched between magnetic flux concentrators sweeping across a Halbach array. The exponential profile captures non-basophils effectively while preventing their excessive initial buildup causing clogging.

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus capitis is primarily described as a human skin commensal but is now emergent as an opportunistic pathogen isolated from bloodstream and prosthetic joint infections, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) associated sepsis. We used comparative genomic analyses of S. capitis to provide new insights of commensal scalp isolates from varying skin states, and to expand our current knowledge of the species populations (scalp isolates, n = 59, contextual isolates, n = 127). A highly recombinogenic population structure was revealed, with genomes including the presence of a range of previously described staphylococcal virulence factors, cell wall-associated proteins, and two-component systems. Genomic differences between the two described S. capitis subspecies were explored and reveal determinants associated exclusively with each. The subspecies ureolyticus was distinguished from subspecies capitis by differences in antimicrobial resistance genes and gene clusters linked to survival on the skin. This study will aid further research into classification of S. capitis and virulence linked phylogroups that is important to monitor the spread and evolution of S. capitis.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication is crucial to generating novel signaling pathways during evolution. However, it remains unclear how the redundant proteins produced by gene duplication ultimately acquire new interaction specificities to establish insulated paralogous signaling pathways. Here, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect and characterize a bacterial two-component signaling system that duplicated in -proteobacteria. We determined the interaction specificities of the signaling proteins that existed before and immediately after this duplication event and then identified key mutations responsible for establishing specificity in the two systems. Just three mutations, in only two of the four interacting proteins, were sufficient to establish specificity of the extant systems. Some of these mutations weakened interactions between paralogous systems to limit crosstalk. However, others strengthened interactions within a system, indicating that the ancestral interaction, although functional, had the potential to be strengthened. Our work suggests that protein-protein interactions with such latent potential may be highly amenable to duplication and divergence.",

    "abstract": "T cells use forces to read out and act on the mechanical parameters of their microenvironment, which includes antigen presenting cells (APCs). Here we explore the early interaction of T cells with an APC-mimicking ultra-soft polymer gel exhibiting physiologically relevant stiffness in the range of 350-450 Pa. We quantify the dependence of cell spreading and stiffness on gel elasticity, and measure early time traction forces. We find that coating the surface with an antibody against the CD3 region of the TCR-complex elicits small but measurable gel deformation in the early recognition phase, which we quantify in terms of stress or energy. We show that the time evolution of the energy follows one of three distinct patterns: active fluctuation, intermittent, or sigmoidal signal. Addition of either anti-CD28 or anti-LFA1 has little impact on the total integrated energy or the maximum stress. However, the relative distribution of the energy patterns does depend on the additional ligands. Remarkably, the forces are centrifugal at very early times, and only later turn into classical in-ward pointing centripetal traction.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, due to its tendency to metastasize early. Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS), also known as CCCTC binding factor-Like (CTCFL), is a transcription regulator that becomes ectopically expressed in melanoma. We recently showed that BORIS contributes to melanoma phenotype switching by altering the gene expression program of proliferative melanoma cells in favor of a more invasive phenotype. However, how BORIS alters the transcriptome remains unclear. Here, ATAC-seq was used to study BORIS-mediated chromatin accessibility alterations in proliferative melanoma cells. Genes that gained promoter accessibility following ectopic BORIS expression, were enriched for melanoma-specific invasive genes as well as invasion-associated biological processes, while promoters of genes associated with proliferation show reduce accessibility. Integration of ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq data demonstrates that increased chromatin accessibility is associated with transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in tumor progression processes, and the aberrant activation of oncogenic transcription factors, while reduced chromatin accessibility and downregulated genes, were associated with repressed activity of tumor suppressors. Together, these findings indicate that BORIS mediates transcriptional reprogramming in melanoma cells by altering chromatin accessibility and gene expression, shifting the cellular transcription landscape of proliferative melanoma cells towards a pro-invasive genetic signature.\n\nSignificanceWe recently reported that BORIS contributes to melanoma phenotype switching by altering the transcriptional landscape of melanoma cells from a proliferative to an invasive state. In this study, using ATAC-Seq, we demonstrate that ectopic BORIS expression in proliferative melanoma cells leads to increased chromatin accessibility at promoters of upregulated invasion-associated genes. Importantly, by integrating the ATAC-Seq data with RNA-Seq data, we were able to identify key cancer-associated transcription factors that become aberrantly activated or repressed following ectopic BORIS expression. Taken together, this study sheds light on the mechanisms by which BORIS mediates phenotype switching in melanoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Seeking to identify consequences of evolution at low temperature, we examine hyper/hypo-osmotic and ionic regulation and gill ion transporter gene expression in two sub-Antarctic Eubrachyura from the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego. Despite sharing the same osmotic niche, Acanthocyclus albatrossis tolerates a wider salinity range (2-65 {per thousand}S) than Halicarcinus planatus (5-60 {per thousand}S); respective lower and upper critical salinities are 4 and 12 {per thousand}S, and 63 and 50 {per thousand}S. Acanthocyclus albatrossis is a weak hyperosmotic regulator, while H. planatus hyper-osmoconforms; isosmotic points are 1,380 and {approx}1,340 mOsm kg-1 H2O. Both crabs hyper/hypo-regulate [Cl-] well with iso-chloride points at 452 and 316 mmol L-1 Cl-, respectively. [Na+] is hyper-regulated at all salinities. mRNA expression of gill Na+/K+-ATPase is salinity-sensitive in A. albatrossis, increasing {approx}1.9-fold at 5 {per thousand}S compared to 30 {per thousand}S, decreasing at 40 to 60 {per thousand}S. Expression in H. planatus is very low salinity-sensitive, increasing {approx}4.7-fold over 30 {per thousand}S, but decreasing at 50 {per thousand}S. V(H+)-ATPase expression decreases in A. albatrossis at low and high salinities as in H. planatus. Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter expression in A. albatrossis increases 2.6-fold at 5 {per thousand}S, but decreases at 60 {per thousand}S compared to 30 {per thousand}S. Chloride uptake may be mediated by increased Na+-K+-2Cl- expression but Cl- secretion is independent of symporter expression. These unrelated eubrachyurans exhibit similar systemic osmoregulatory characteristics and are better adapted to dilute media; however, the gene expressions underlying ion uptake and secretion show marked interspecific divergences. Cold clime crabs may have limited energy expenditure by regulating hemolymph [Cl-] alone, apportioning resources for other metabolic processes.\n\nSummary statementSub-Antarctic crabs may skimp on osmoregulatory capabilities to apportion energy for metabolic processes. They regulate chloride but not sodium or osmolality. Transporter gene expressions diverge markedly. Adaptive, differential ion regulation may characterize cold clime crabs.",

However, the mechanisms by which these viruses induce meningeal inflammation is poorly understood, owing at least in part to the lack of in vivo models that recapitulate this aspect of echovirus pathogenesis. Here, we developed an in vivo neonatal mouse model that recapitulates key aspects of echovirus-induced meningitis. We found that expression of the human homologue of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), the primary echovirus receptor, in neonatal mice was not sufficient for infection of the brain. However, ablation of type I, but not III, IFN signaling in mice expressing human FcRn permitted high levels of echovirus replication in the brain, with corresponding clinical symptoms including delayed motor skills and hind limb weakness. We also defined the immunological response of the brain to echovirus infections and identified key cytokines induced by this infection. Lastly, we found that echoviruses robustly replicate in the leptomeninges, where they induce profound inflammation and cell death. Together, this work establishes an in vivo model of aseptic meningitis associated with echovirus infections and defines the specificity of echoviral infections within the meninges.\n\nSignificance StatementEchoviruses are amongst the most common causes of aseptic meningitis worldwide, which can cause long-term sequelae or even death.

Attributing biological functions to cortical excitability requires an understanding of the natural behavior of excitable waves and the ability to accurately quantify wave properties. Here we have investigated and quantified the onset of cortical excitability in X. laevis eggs and embryos, and the changes in cortical excitability throughout early development. We found that cortical excitability begins to manifest shortly after egg activation. Further, we identified a close relationship between wave properties - such as wave frequency and amplitude - and cell cycle progression as well as cell size. Finally, we identified quantitative differences between cortical excitability in the cleavage furrow relative to non-furrow cortical excitability and showed that these wave regimes are mutually exclusive.",

    "abstract": "The maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais, is a ubiquitous pest of maize and other cereal crops worldwide and remains a threat to food security in subsistence communities. Few population genetic studies have been conducted on the maize weevil, but those that exist have shown that there is very little genetic differentiation between geographically dispersed populations and that it is likely the species has experienced a recent range expansion within the last few hundred years. While the previous studies found little genetic structure, they relied primarily on mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite markers for their analyses. It is possible that more fine-scaled population genetic structure exists due to local population dynamics, the biological limits of natural species dispersal, and the isolated nature of subsistence farming communities. In contrast to previous studies, here, we utilized genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data to evaluate the genetic population structure of the maize weevil from the southern and coastal Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. Our study is the first to find significant genetic population structure in the maize weevil. Here, we show that although there continues to be gene flow between populations of maize weevil, that fine-scale genetic structure exists. It is possible that this structure is shaped by the movement and trade of maize by humans in the region, by geographic barriers to gene flow, or a combination of factors.",

Thymol, carvacrol and linalool displayed approximately 50% inhibition at 1.5 mmol/litre concentrations using para-nitrophenyl palmitate. UV-Vis spectroscopy give evidence of the formation of lipase-linalool, lipasecarvacrol and lipase-thymol complex at the ground state. Three molecules also showed complex formation with HSA at the ground state. Fluorescence spectroscopy shows strong binding of lipase to thymol (Ka of 2.6 x 109 M-1) as compared to carvacrol (4.66 x 107 M-1) and linalool (5.3 x 103 M-1). Number of binding sites showing stoichiometry of association process on lipase is found to be 2.52 (thymol) compared to 2.04 (carvacrol) and 1.12 (linalool). Secondary structure analysis by CD spectra results, following 24 hours incubation at 25{degrees}C, with thymol, carvacrol and linalool revealed decrease in negative ellipticity for lipase indicating loss in helical structure as compared with the native protein. The lowering in negative ellipticity was in the order of thymol > carvacrol > linalool.\n\nResults of Fluorescence and CD spectroscopy taken together suggests that thymol and carvacrol are profound disrupter of lipase structure.\n\nFluorescence spectra following binding of all three molecules with HSA caused blue shift which suggests the compaction of the HSA structure. Association constant of thymol and HSA is 9.6 x 108 M-1 which along with  n value of 2.41 suggests strong association and stable complex formation, association constant for carvacrol and linalool was in range of 107 and 103 respectively.\n\nDocking results give further insight into strong binding of thymol, carvacrol and linalool with lipase having free energy of binding as -7.1 kcal/mol, -5.0 kcal/mol and -5.2 kcal/mol respectively.\n\nTo conclude, fungal lipases can be attractive target for controlling their growth and pathogenicity. Employing UV-Vis, Fluorescence and Circular dichroism spectroscopy we have shown that thymol, carvacrol and linalool strongly bind and disrupt structure of fungal lipase, these three phytochemicals also bind well with HSA.

Methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), associated with open chromatin and gene transcription, is catalyzed by type 2 lysine methyltransferase complexes that require WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L and DPY30 as core subunits. Ash2l is essential during embryogenesis and for maintaining adult tissues. To expand on the mechanistic understanding of Ash2l, we generated mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) with conditional Ash2l alleles. Upon loss of Ash2l, methylation of H3K4 and gene expression were downregulated, which correlated with inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moreover, we observed induction of senescence concomitant with a set of downregulated signature genes but independent of SASP. Many of the signature genes are FoxM1 responsive. Indeed, exogenous FOXM1 was sufficient to delay senescence. Thus, although the loss of Ash2l in MEFs has broad and complex consequences, a distinct set of downregulated genes promotes senescence.",

    "abstract": "Genomic variation plays a crucial role in biology, serving as a base for evolution - allowing for adaptation on a species or population level. At the individual level, however, specific alleles can be implicated in diseases. To interpret genetic variants identified in an individual potentially affected with a rare genetic disease, it is fundamental to know the population frequency of each allele, ideally in an ancestry matched cohort. Equity in human genomics remains a challenge for the field, and there are not yet cohorts representing most populations. Currently, when ancestry matched cohorts are not available, pooled variant libraries are used, such as gnomAD, the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) or the 1,000 Genomes Project (now known as IGSR: International Genome Sample Resource). When working with a pooled collection of variant frequencies, one of the challenges is to determine efficiently if a variant is broadly spread across populations or appears selectively in one or more populations. While this can be accomplished by reviewing tables of population frequencies, it can be advantageous to have a single score that summarizes the observed dispersion. This score would not require classifying individuals into populations, which can be complicated if it is a homogenous population, or can leave individuals excluded from all the predefined population groups. Moreover, a score would not display fine-scaled population information, which could have privacy implications and consequently be inappropriate to release. Therefore, we sought to develop a scoring method based on a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) where, for each allele, the score can range from 0 (the variant is limited to a subset of close individuals within the whole cohort) to 1 (the variant is spread among the individuals represented in the cohort). We call this score the Allele Dispersion Score (ADS). The scoring system was implemented on the IGSR dataset, and compared to the current method consisting in displaying variant frequencies for several populations in a table. The ADS correlates with the population frequencies, without requiring grouping of individuals.",
