    "abstract": "Gene silencing in bacteria is mediated by chromatin proteins, of which Escherichia coli H-NS is a paradigmatic example. H-NS forms nucleoprotein filaments with either one or two DNA duplexes. However, the structures, arrangements of DNA-binding domains (DBDs), and positions of DBD-DNA contacts in linear and bridged filaments are uncertain. To characterize the contacts that silence transcription by RNA polymerase, we combined {middle dot}OH footprinting, molecular dynamics, statistical modeling, and DBD mapping using a chemical nuclease (Fe2+-EDTA) tethered to the DBDs (TEN-map). We find that H-NS DBDs contact DNA at indistinguishable locations in bridged or linear filaments and that the DBDs vary in orientation and position with ~10-bp average spacing. Our results support a hemi-sequestration model of linear-to-bridged H-NS switching in which linear filaments able to inhibit only transcription initiation switch to bridged filaments able to inhibit both initiation and elongation using the same irregularly spaced DNA contact sites.\n\nHighlightsO_LITethered-nuclease mapping (TEN-map) of H-NS DNA-binding domains detects DNA contacts\nC_LIO_LIBridged and linear H-NS filaments use the same DNA contact sites\nC_LIO_LIH-NS-DNA contacts are unevenly spaced with ~10 bp average separation\nC_LIO_LIAT-steps, minor groove width, and electrostatic potential best predict contact sites\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Winter chill accumulation is critical for the productivity and profitability of perennial tree fruit systems. Several studies have quantified the impacts of global warming on chill accumulation in the warmer production regions of the world, where insufficient chill events occur and their frequency is increasing. In contrast, we focus on a region with relatively cold winters-the Pacific Northwest United States (PNW)-where insufficient chill events are currently absent, and quantify the potential for introduction of these risks under climate change. Results identified spatial variation within the PNW, with chill accumulation projected to increase in some areas but decrease in others. There was also spatiotemporal variation in the driving factors of changes to chill accumulation. Even with decreases in chill accumulations, there are likely minimal issues with insufficient chill accumulation. However, delayed chill accumulation in combination with advances in the onset of heat accumulation can potentially shift the region from one where spring phenology is primarily forcing-driven to one where the dynamic interplay between chilling and forcing processes become important. These interactions might create production risks for varieties with high chill requirements, post mid-21st-century under high emissions scenarios. Future work should focus on understanding, modeling, and projecting responses across these overlapping chilling and forcing processes. Additionally, given significant spatial differences across a relatively small geographic range, it is also critical to understand and model these dynamics at a local landscape resolution for regions such as the PNW.",

    "abstract": "The Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) is a poorly studied ultra-oligotrophic marine environment, dominated by small-size phyto- and bacterioplankton. Here, we describe the dynamics of a single annual cycle (2018-19) of phyto- and bacterioplankton (abundances, pigments and productivity) in relation to the physical and chemical conditions in the photic water column at an offshore EMS site (Station THEMO-2, [~]1,500m depth, 50km offshore). We show that phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a), primary and bacterial productivity differed between the mixed winter (January-April) and the thermally stratified (May-December) periods. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus numerically dominated the picophytoplankton populations, with each clade revealing different temporal and depth changes indicative to them, while pico-eukaryotes (primarily haptophytes) were less abundant, yet likely contributed significant biomass. Estimated primary productivity ([~]32 gC m-2 y-1) was lower compared with other well-studied oligotrophic locations, including the north Atlantic and Pacific (BATS and HOT observatories), the western Mediterranean (DYFAMED observatory) and the Red Sea, and was on-par with the ultra-oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre. In contrast, integrated bacterial production ([~]11 gC m-2 y-1) was similar to other oligotrophic locations. Phytoplankton seasonal dynamics were similar to those at BATS and the Red Sea, suggesting an observable effect of winter mixing in this ultra-oligotrophic location. These results highlight the ultra-oligotrophic conditions in the EMS and provide, for the first time in this region, a full-year baseline and context to ocean observatories in the region.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBacterioplankton dynamics were assessed monthly in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea\nC_LIO_LISmall-sized picophytoplankton numerically dominated the phytoplankton community\nC_LIO_LISeasonal phytoplankton dynamics are similar to BATS and Red Sea, but not to HOT\nC_LIO_LIAnnual primary productivity is among the lowest in the worlds oceans\nC_LIO_LIBacterial to primary production ratio is higher than most oligotrophic seas\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Interactions between plants and neighboring microbial species are fundamental elements that collectively determine the structure and function of the plant microbiota. However, the molecular basis of such interactions is poorly characterized. Here, we monocolonized Arabidopsis leaves with nine plant- associated bacteria from all major phyla of the plant microbiota and profiled co- transcriptomes of plants and bacteria. We detected both common and distinct co- transcriptome signatures among plant-commensal pairs. In planta responses of commensals were similar to those of a disarmed pathogen characterized by the suppression of genes involved in general metabolism in contrast to a virulent pathogen. We identified genes that are enriched in the genome of plant-associated bacteria and induced in planta, which may be instrumental for bacterial adaptation to the host environment and niche separation. This study provides insights into how plants discriminate among bacterial strains and lays the foundation for in- depth mechanistic dissection of plant-microbiota interactions.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, photoreceptor loss causes permanent blindness, but in zebrafish (Danio rerio), photoreceptor loss reprograms Muller glia to function as stem cells, producing progenitors that regenerate photoreceptors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate CNS neurogenesis, but the roles of miRNAs in injury-induced neuronal regeneration are largely unknown. In the embryonic zebrafish retina, miR-18a regulates photoreceptor differentiation. The purpose of the current study was to determine, in zebrafish, the function of miR-18a during injury-induced photoreceptor regeneration. RT-qPCR, in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that miR-18a expression increases throughout the retina between 1 and 5 days post-injury (dpi). To test miR-18a function during photoreceptor regeneration, we used homozygous miR-18a mutants (miR-18ami5012), and knocked down miR-18a with morpholino oligonucleotides. During photoreceptor regeneration, miR-18ami5012 retinas have fewer mature photoreceptors than WT at 7 and 10 dpi, but there is no difference at 14 dpi, indicating that photoreceptor regeneration is delayed. Labeling dividing cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) showed that at 7 and 10 dpi, there are excess dividing progenitors in both mutants and morphants, indicating that miR-18a negatively regulates injury-induced proliferation. Tracing 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and BrdU-labeled cells showed that in miR-18ami5012 retinas excess progenitors migrate to other retinal layers in addition to the photoreceptor layer. Inflammation is critical for photoreceptor regeneration, and RT-qPCR showed that in miR-18ami5012 retinas, inflammatory gene expression and microglia activation are prolonged. Suppressing inflammation with dexamethasone rescues the miR-18ami5012 phenotype. Together, these data show that in the injured zebrafish retina, disruption of miR-18a alters proliferation, inflammation, the microglia/macrophage response, and the timing of photoreceptor regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Motherhood induces a drastic, sometimes long-lasting, change in internal state and behavior in most female animals. How a change in reproductive state or the discrete event of mating modulates specific female behaviors is still incompletely understood. Using calcium imaging of the whole brain of Drosophila females, we find that mating does not induce a global change in brain activity. Instead, mating modulates the pheromone response of dopaminergic neurons innervating the flys learning and memory center, the mushroom body (MB). Using the mating-induced increased attraction to the odor of important nutrients, polyamines, we show that disruption of the female flys ability to smell, for instance the pheromone cVA, during mating leads to a reduction in polyamine preference for days later indicating that the odor environment at mating lastingly influences female perception and choice behavior. Moreover, dopaminergic neurons including innervation of the {beta}1 compartment are sufficient to replace mating experience in virgin females inducing the lasting behavioral increase in polyamine preference. We further show that MB output neurons (MBON) of the {beta}1 compartment are activated by pheromone odor and their activity during mating bidirectionally modulates preference behavior in mated and virgin females. Their activity is not required, however, for the expression of polyamine attraction. Instead, inhibition of another type of MBON innervating the {beta}2 compartment enables expression of high polyamine attraction. In addition, the response of a lateral horn (LH) neuron, AD1b2, which output is required for the expression of polyamine attraction, shows a modulated polyamine response after mating. Taken together, our data in the fly suggests that mating-related sensory experience regulates female odor perception and expression of choice behavior through a dopamine-gated learning circuit.",

A key bottleneck in the full exploration of this tremendous source of new structures and pharmaceutical activities is the compound purification needed for bioactivity assignments of individual compounds and downstream structure elucidation. To enable bioactivity-focused compound identification from complex mixtures, we developed a scalable native metabolomics approach that integrates non-targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and simultaneous detection of protein binding via native mass spectrometry. While screening for new protease inhibitors from an environmental cyanobacteria community, native metabolomics revealed 30 cyclodepsipeptides as chymotrypsin binders. Mass spectrometry-guided purification then allowed for the full structure elucidation of four new specialized metabolites via tandem mass spectrometry, chemical derivatization, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Together with the evaluation of biological activities, our results identified the rivulariapeptolides as a family of serine protease inhibitors with nanomolar potency, highlighting native metabolomics as promising approach for drug discovery, chemical ecology, and chemical biology studies.",

The resulting diversity of mRNA molecules across different life-cycle stages impacts their functionality but has remained unresolved. Here we quantitatively map the 3' status of cellular RNAs in Escherichia coli during steady-state growth and report a large fraction of molecules (median>60%) that are fragments of canonical full-length mRNAs. The majority of RNA fragments are decay intermediates, whereas nascent RNAs contribute to a smaller fraction. Despite the prevalence of decay intermediates in total cellular RNA, these intermediates are underrepresented in the pool of ribosome-associated transcripts and can thus distort quantifications for the abundance of full-length, functional mRNAs. The large heterogeneity within mRNA molecules in vivo highlights the importance in discerning functional transcripts and provides a lens for studying the dynamic life cycle of mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Motile cilia are hair-like cell extensions present in multiple organs of the body. How cilia coordinate their regular beat in multiciliated epithelia to move fluids remains insufficiently understood, particularly due to lack of rigorous quantification. We combine here experiments, novel analysis tools, and theory to address this knowledge gap. We investigate collective dynamics of cilia in the zebrafish nose, due to its conserved properties with other ciliated tissues and its superior accessibility for non-invasive imaging. We revealed that cilia are synchronized only locally and that the size of local synchronization domains increases with the viscosity of the surrounding medium. Despite the fact that synchronization is local only, we observed global patterns of traveling metachronal waves across the multiciliated epithelium. Intriguingly, these global wave direction patterns are conserved across individual fish, but different for left and right nose, unveiling a chiral asymmetry of metachronal coordination. To understand the implications of synchronization for fluid pumping, we used a computational model of a regular array of cilia. We found that local metachronal synchronization prevents steric collisions and improves fluid pumping in dense cilia carpets, but hardly affects the direction of fluid flow. In conclusion, we show that local synchronization together with tissue-scale cilia alignment are sufficient to generate metachronal wave patterns in multiciliated epithelia, which enhance their physiological function of fluid pumping.",

Patients with acute focal hemispheric lesions (e.g. stroke) do not manifest vestibular agnosia. Thus brain network mapping techniques, e.g. resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), are needed to interrogate functional brain networks mediating vestibular agnosia. Whole-brain rsfMRI was acquired from 39 prospectively recruited acute TBI patients with preserved peripheral vestibular function, along with self-motion perceptual thresholds during passive yaw rotations in the dark. Following quality-control checks, 25 patient scans were analyzed. TBI patients were classified as having vestibular agnosia (n = 11) or not (n = 14) via laboratory testing of self-motion perception. Using independent component analysis, we found altered functional connectivity in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and left rostral prefrontal cortex in vestibular agnosia. Moreover, regions of interest analyses showed both inter-hemispheric and intra-hemispheric network disruption in vestibular agnosia. In conclusion, our results show that vestibular agnosia is mediated by bilateral anterior and posterior network dysfunction and reveal the distributed brain mechanisms mediating vestibular self-motion perception.",

    "abstract": "The human endometrium experiences repetitive cycles of tissue wounding characterised by piecemeal shedding of the surface epithelium and rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis. In this study we used a mouse model of endometrial repair and three transgenic lines of mice to investigate whether epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium have their origins in one or more of the mesenchymal cell types present in the stromal compartment of the endometrium. Using scRNAseq we identified a novel population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. To confirm our hypothesis we used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts (PDGFRa+) and stromal perivascular cells (NG2/CSPG4+). We demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialised luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons both to endometrial pathologies which involve a fibrotic response (Ashermans syndrome, endometriosis) as well as other mucosal tissues which have a variable response to wounding.\n\nHighlightsO_LISingle cell RNA sequencing identified a population of PDGFR{beta}+ mesenchymal cells with a unique transcriptomic signature that arises in response to induction of a menses-like wound\nC_LIO_LIThe repair-specific mesenchymal cells express genes considered specific to both mesenchymal and epithelial lineages indicative of an intermediate phenotype and a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET)\nC_LIO_LIin silico trajectory analysis revealed that repair-specific cells originate from the fibroblast cell clusters, were distinct from perivascular cells, and had a predicted trans-differentiation trajectory towards definitive epithelial cells\nC_LIO_LIin vivo lineage tracing in adult mice provides definitive evidence that PDGFR+ endometrial fibroblasts, and not NG2+ perivascular cells, undergo MET and can become incorporated into the luminal epithelium of the post repair tissue\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In the presence of recombination individuals may inherit different regions of their genome from different ancestors, resulting in a mosaic of phylogenetic histories across their genome. Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) can capture how phylogenetic relationships vary across the genome due to recombination, but reconstructing ARGs from genomic sequence data is notoriously difficult. Here we present a method for reconciling discordant phylogenetic trees and reconstructing ARGs using maximum agreement forests (MAFs). Given two discordant trees, a MAF identifies a set of topologically concordant subtrees present in both trees. We show how discordant trees can be reconciled through their MAF in a way that retains discordances strongly supported by sequence data while eliminating conflicts likely attributable to phylogenetic noise. We further show how MAFs and our reconciliation approach can be combined to select a path of local trees across the genome that maximizes the likelihood of the genomic sequence data, minimizes discordance between neighboring local trees, and identifies the recombination events necessary to explain remaining discordances to obtain a fully connected ARG. While heuristic, our ARG reconstruction approach is often as accurate as more exact methods while being much more computationally efficient. Moreover, important demographic parameters such as recombination rates can be accurately estimated from reconstructed ARGs. Finally, we apply our approach to plant infecting RNA viruses in the genus Potyvirus to demonstrate how true recombination events can be disentangled from phylogenetic noise using our ARG reconstruction methods.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines are cell signaling proteins that act as inducers of physiological responses including the activation and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cell types. In some cases, this mediates the initiation or progression of inflammatory and auto-immune diseases such as septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Many cytokines are pleiotropic, meaning that they can have effects on multiple cell types and play several distinct functions. On the other hand, multiple cytokines might have similar function and be redundant or degenerate. Some cytokines also regulate the expression and functions of other cytokines. Such complex cause-effect relationships can be modeled computationally by building \"cytokine networks\". Those networks describe intricate interactions between different cytokines in their associated tissue environment and cell types. Here we propose a computational approach to find sensitive and \"causal\" nodes within a cytokine interaction network by identifying whether persistent positive feedback (self-loop) exists on that cytokine in its mRNA transcription network. Based upon two microarray gene expression datasets from immune stimulation experiments using up to 15 different cytokines, we identified TNF as a \"causal\" cytokine in the colonic epithelial cell line HCT8, and IL-23, IL-1{beta} and TGF{beta} as \"causal\" cytokines in primary myofibroblasts. We hypothesize that a cytokine with a persistent positive feedback loop that amplifies its transcription and secretion could be identified as \"causal\" for the transcriptional regulation of other cytokines and potentially, downstream disease phenotypes. The existence of such positive feedback loop may determine whether targeting suppression of such cytokine will result in clinical efficacy.",

    "abstract": "RFC uses ATP to assemble PCNA onto primed sites for replicative DNA polymerases {delta} and {varepsilon}. The RFC pentamer forms a central chamber that binds 3 ss/ds DNA junctions to load PCNA onto DNA during replication. We show here five structures that identify a 2nd DNA binding site in RFC that binds a 5 duplex. This 5 DNA site is located between the N-terminal BRCT domain and AAA+ module of the large Rfc1 subunit. Our structures reveal ideal binding to a 7-nt gap, which includes 2 bp unwound by the clamp loader. Biochemical studies show enhanced binding to 5 and 10 nt gaps, consistent with the structural results. Because both 3 and 5 ends are present at a ssDNA gap, we propose that the 5 site facilitates RFCs PCNA loading activity at a DNA damage-induced gap to recruit gap-filling polymerases. These findings are consistent with genetic studies showing that base excision repair of gaps greater than 1 base requires PCNA and involves the 5 DNA binding domain of Rfc1. We further observe that a 5 end facilitates PCNA loading at an RPA coated 30-nt gap, suggesting a potential role of the RFC 5-DNA site in lagging strand DNA synthesis",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are the most prevalent substance use disorders worldwide. Considering recent reports indicating an increase in alcohol use particularly in females, it is vital to understand how alcohol history impacts behavior. Animal model research on withdrawal-associated affective states tends to focus on males, forced alcohol paradigms, and a few traditional anxiety/stress tests. While this has been essential, heavy alcohol use triggers adverse withdrawal-related affective states that can influence how people respond to a large variety of life events and stressors. To this end, we show that behaviors in the home-cage, open field, looming disc, and robogator predator threat task, which vary in task demand and intensity, are altered in mice with a history of voluntary alcohol consumption. In alcohol-exposed males, behaviors in the home cage, a low anxiety baseline environment, suggest increased vigilance/exploration. However, in the open field and robogator task, which induce heightened arousal and task demands, a more hesitant/avoidant phenotype is seen. Female alcohol mice show no behavioral alterations in the home cage and open field test, however, in the looming disc task, which mimics an overhead advancing predator and forces a behavioral choice, we see greater escape responses compared to water controls, indicative of active stress coping behaviors. This suggests females may begin to show alcohol-induced alterations as task demands increase. To date, few drugs have advanced past clinical trials for the treatment of AUD, and those that have are predominately used in life-threatening situations only. No treatments exist for ameliorating negative withdrawal related states, which could aid in harm reduction related to heavy alcohol use. Understanding how withdrawal alters a variety of behavioral responses that are linked to stress coping can widen our understanding of alcohol abuse and lead us closer to better therapeutics to help individuals with AUD.",

    "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis is associated with hepato-splenomegaly and altered immune and haematological parameters in both pre-clinical animal models and humans. We studied mouse experimental visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani in BALB/c mice using dual RNA-seq to investigate the transcriptional response of host and parasite in liver and spleen. We identified only 4 species-specific parasite expressed genes (SSPEGs; log2FC >1, FDR <0.05) in the infected spleen, and none in the infected liver. For the host transcriptome, we found 789 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2FC >1, FDR <0.05) in the spleen that were common to both infections, with IFN{gamma} signaling and complement and coagulation cascade pathways highly enriched, and an additional 286 and 186 DEGs that were selective to L. donovani and L. infantum infection respectively. Among those, there were network interactions between genes of amino acid metabolism and PPAR signaling in L. donovani infection and increased IL1{beta} and positive regulation of fatty acid transport in L. infantum infection, although no pathway enrichment was observed. In the liver, there were 1939 DEGs in mice infected with either L. infantum or L. donovani in comparison to uninfected mice, and the most enriched pathways were IFN{gamma} signaling, neutrophil mediated immunity, complement and coagulation, cytokine-chemokine responses and hemostasis. Additionally, 221 DEGs were selective in L. donovani and 429 DEGs in L. infantum infections. These data show that the host response for these two visceral leishmaniasis infection models is broadly similar, and [~]10% of host DEGs vary in infections with either parasite species.\n\nImportanceVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by two species of Leishmania parasites, L. donovani in the Old World and L. infantum in the New World and countries bordering the Mediterranean. Although cardinal features such as hepato-splenomegaly and alterations in blood and immune function are evident, clinical presentation may vary by geography, with for example severe bleeding often associated with VL in Brazil. Although animal models of both L. donovani and L. infantum have been widely used to study disease pathogenesis, a direct side-by-side comparison of how these parasites species impact the infected host and/or how they might respond to the stresses of mammalian infection has not been previously reported. Identifying common and distinct pathways to pathogenesis will be important to ensure that new therapeutic or prophylactic approaches will be applicable across all forms of VL.",

    "abstract": "Despite being unicellular organisms, bacteria undergo complex regulation mechanisms which coordinate different physiological traits. Among others, DegU, DegS, and Spo0A are the pleiotropic proteins which govern various cellular responses and behaviors. However, the functions and regulatory networks between these three proteins are rarely described in the highly interesting bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa. In this study, we investigate the roles of DegU, DegS, and Spo0A by introduction of targeted point mutations facilitated by a CRISPR-Cas9-based system. In total, five different mutant strains were generated: the single mutants DegU Q218*, DegS L99F, Spo0A A257V, the double mutant DegU Q218* DegS L99F, and the triple mutant DegU Q218* DegS L99F Spo0A A257V. Characterization of the wild type and the engineered strains revealed differences in swarming behavior, genetic competence, sporulation, and viscosity formation of the culture broth. In particular, the double mutant DegU Q218* DegS L99F showed significant increase in regard to the genetic competence as well as a stable exopolysaccharides formation. Furthermore, we highlight similarities and differences of the roles of DegU, DegS, and Spo0A between P. polymyxa and related species. Finally, this study provides novel insights in the complex regulatory system of P. polymyxa DSM 365.\n\nImportanceTo date, only limited knowledge is available on how complex cellular behaviors are regulated in P. polymyxa. In this study, we investigate three regulatory proteins which play a role in governing different physiological traits. Precise targeted point mutations are introduced to their respective genes by employing a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas9-based system. Characterization of the strains revealed some similarities, but also differences, with the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis in regard to the regulation of cellular behaviors. Furthermore, we identified several strains which have superior performance in comparison to the wild type strain. Overall, our study provides novel insights which will be of importance in understanding how multiple cellular processes are regulated in Paenibacillus species.",

Although IL-34 is a cytokine first described as mainly involved in monocyte cell survival and differentiation, we recently described its expression by CD8+ Tregs in a rat model of transplantation tolerance and by activated FOXP3+ CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs in human healthy individuals. However, its role in autoimmunity and potential in human diseases remain to be determined. Here we report that the absence of expression of IL-34 in Il34-/- rodents leads to an unstable phenotype, with production of multiple auto-antibodies, exacerbated under inflammatory conditions with increased susceptibility to DSS- and TNBS-colitis in deficient animals. Moreover, we strikingly revealed the inability of Il34-/- CD4+ Tregs to protect Il2rg-/- rats from a wasting disease induced by transfer of pathogenic cells, in contrast to Il34+/+ CD4+ Tregs. We also showed that IL-34 treatment delayed EAE in mice as well as GVHD and human skin allograft rejection in immune humanized immunodeficient NSG mice. Finally, we show that presence of IL-34 in the serum is associated with a longer rejection-free period in kidney transplanted patients. Altogether, our data emphasize on the crucial necessity of IL-34 for immune homeostasis and for CD4+ Tregs suppressive function. Our data also shows the therapeutic potential of IL-34 in human transplantation and auto-immunity.",

    "abstract": "Phospholipase D (PLD) interacts with the BBSome for loading onto retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains to exit cilia in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. PLD ciliary retention and depletion of Rab-like 4 (RABL4) GTPase IFT27 cause the same non-phototactic phenotype but not impair IFT and ciliation. Here, we show that the IFT-B1 subunit IFT27 binds its partner IFT25 to form the heterodimeric IFT25/27 in an IFT27 nucleotide state-independent manner. IFT25/27, IFT-A, and IFT-B are irrelevant for maintaining the stability of one another. GTP-loading onto IFT27 enhances the IFT25/27 affinity for IFT-B1 in cytoplasm, while GDP-loaded IFT27 does not prevent IFT25/27 from entering and cycling through cilia by integrating into IFT-B1. Upon at the ciliary tip, IFT25/27 cycles on and off IFT-B1 and this process is irrelevant with the nucleotide state of IFT27. During BBSome remodeling at the ciliary tip, IFT25/27 promotes BBSome reassembly independent of IFT27 nucleotide state, making post-remodeled BBSomes available for PLD to interact with. Therefore, IFT25/27 facilitates BBSome-dependent PLD export from cilia via controlling availability of intact BBSomes at the ciliary tip, providing a regulatory mechanism for IFT27 to mediate phototaxis in C. reinhardtii.",

In the nervous system, chemokines participate both in physiological and pathological processes, and while their expression is often described on glial and immune cells, growing evidence describe the expression of chemokines and their receptors in neurons, highlighting, their potential in auto- and paracrine signalling. In this study we analysed the role of nociception in the neuronal chemokinome, and their role in axonal growth. We found that stimulating TRPV1+ nociceptors induces a transient increase in CCL21. Interestingly we found that, this CCL21 increases neurite growth of large diameter proprioceptors in vitro. Consistent with this, we show that proprioceptors express the CCL21 receptor CCR7, and a CCR7 neutralizing antibody dose-dependently attenuates CCL21-induced neurite outgrowth. Mechanistically, we found that CCL21 binds locally to its receptor CCR7 at the growth cone, activating the downstream MEK-ERK pathway, that in turn activates N-WASP, triggering actin filament ramification in the growth cone, resulting in increased axonal growth.",

Although the complex morphogenetic movements directing cell convergence towards the midline have been described extensively, little is known on how gastrulating cells interpret mechanical cues. Yap proteins are among the best characterized transcriptional mechanotransducers, yet their role in gastrulation has remained elusive. Here we show that the double knockout of yap and its paralog yap1b in medaka results in an axis assembly failure. Quantitative live imaging reveals that mutant cells display reduced displacement and migratory persistence. By characterizing the Yap-dependent transcriptional program, we identified genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell-ECM adhesion, rather than in germ layer specification, as direct Yap targets. Dynamic analysis of Tead sensors and downstream targets reveals Yap is acting in migratory cells, and not as a midline beacon, to direct gastrulating precursors trajectories by promoting cortical actin recruitment and focal adhesions assembly. We propose that Yap is engaged in a mechano-regulatory loop that is essential to maintain the directed cell migration sustaining embryo axis formation.",

    "abstract": "Specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs), the lineage which gives rise to eggs and sperm, is essential for sexually reproducing organisms. The mechanism by which animals specify their PGCs generally falls into two categories: inherited or inductive. The inductive mechanism, used by mammals, relies on cell signaling interactions to direct a subset of embryonic cells to a germ cell fate. Previous work suggested that sea star embryos, which develop in simple culture and are markedly transparent, also use inductive mechanisms to specify their germline. The germ cell factors Nanos and Vasa become restricted during early development into a localized region of cells within the posterior enterocoel (PE), the presumptive germline. Nodal signaling was observed to negatively regulate Vasa and Nanos mRNAs outside of the PE and restrict the germline to the PE. Here we employed single cell RNA sequencing to identify the transcriptional program of germ cells and their changes during development. We never see Nodal pathway members within Nanos/Vasa positive cells in the region known to give rise to the PE, and instead see members of the Wnt-signaling pathway and the FoxY family of transcription factors. We learned that Wnt and Delta/Notch signaling enhances expression of both Nanos and Vasa, whereas a test of cell interactions reveals that Nanos and Vasa are regulated distinctly. This work provides insights into the sequence of events that leads to PGC specification and enables deeper mechanistic studies in a tractable in vivo model.\n\nHighlightsO_LISingle-cell RNA-sequencing of sea star embryos demonstrates temporal differences in cell fate commitment among echinoderms.\nC_LIO_LISea urchin and sea star embryos appear to ascribe their germ line by two extreme different mechanisms but share similar pathways in regulation of the germline genes.\nC_LIO_LIExpression of the germline factors, Vasa and Nanos, is regulated by distinct mechanisms in the sea star.\nC_LIO_LIGermline induction in the sea star uses similar signaling mechanisms as mammals.\nC_LI",

However, the long lifespan and limited amenability to genetic and pharmacological perturbations have hindered the use of mammals for dissecting aging-regulatory molecular networks and discovering new anti-aging interventions. To circumvent these limitations, we developed an ex vivo model system that faithfully mimics the aging process of the mammalian brain using cultured mouse brain slices. Genome-wide gene expression analyses showed that brain slices spontaneously upregulated senescence-associated genes over time and reproduced many of the transcriptional characteristics of aged brains. Treatment with rapamycin, a classical anti-aging compound, largely abolished the time-dependent transcriptional changes in brain slices. Using this model system, we discovered that prions drastically accelerated the development of age-related molecular signatures and the pace of brain aging. We confirmed this finding in mouse models and human victims of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These data establish a novel, eminently tractable mammalian model of brain aging, and uncover a surprising acceleration of brain aging in prion diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cannflavins A and B are flavonoids that accumulate in the Cannabis sativa plant. These specialized metabolites are uniquely prenylated and highly lipophilic, which, a priori, may permit their interaction with membrane-bound enzymes and receptors. Although previous studies found that cannflavins can produce anti-inflammatory responses by inhibiting the biosynthesis of pro- inflammatory mediators, the full extent of their cellular influence remains to be understood. Here, we studied these flavonoids in relation to the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by the growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Using mouse primary cortical neurons, we first collected evidence that cannflavins prevent the accumulation of Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc, also known as Arg3.1) protein upon TrkB stimulation by exogenous BDNF in these cells. Consistent with this effect, we also observed a reduced activation of TrkB and downstream signaling effectors that mediate Arc mRNA transcription when BDNF was co-applied with the cannflavins. Of note, we also performed a high-throughput screen that demonstrated a lack of agonist action of cannflavins towards 320 different G protein-coupled receptors, a result that specifically limit the possibility of a TrkB transinactivation scenario via G protein signaling to explain our results with dissociated neurons. Finally, we used Neuro2a cells overexpressing TrkB to show that cannflavins can block the growth of neurites and increased survival rate produced by the higher abundance of the receptor in this model. Taken together, our study offers a new path to understand the reported effects of cannflavins and other closely related compounds in different cellular contexts.",

Does the emergence of brain regions that selectively process novel visual stimuli like words occur at the expense of cortical representations of other stimuli like faces and objects? To answer this question we conducted a randomized controlled trial with pre-school children (five years of age). We found that being taught reading versus oral language skills induced different patterns of change in category-selective regions of visual cortex. Reading instruction enhanced the response to text but did not diminish the response to other categories.

    "abstract": "Brain function depends on neural communication, but the mechanisms of this communication are not well understood. Recent studies suggest that one form of neural communication is through traveling waves (TWs)--patterns of neural oscillations that propagate within and between areas. We show that TWs appear robustly in microarray recordings in monkey frontal and parietal cortex and encode memory for recent rewards. While making saccades to obtain probabilistic rewards, monkeys were sensitive to the (statistically irrelevant) prior reward, which is consistent with behavioral biases produced by reward history. TWs in frontal and parietal areas were stronger in trials following a prior reward versus a lack of reward and, in the frontal lobe, correlated with the monkeys sensitivity to the prior reward. The findings suggest that neural communication across fronto-parietal areas, reflected by TWs, maintains default reward memories, while communication within the frontal lobe mediates the read out of the memories for prospective expectations.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of food intake and energy balance relies on the dynamic integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals monitoring nutritional, metabolic, cognitive and emotional states. The paraventricular thalamus (PVT) is a central hub that, by integrating sensory, metabolic and emotional states, may contribute to the regulation of feeding and homeostatic/allostatic processes. However, the underlying PVT circuits remain still elusive. Here, we aimed at unraveling the role of catecholaminergic (CA) inputs to the PVT in scaling feeding and metabolic efficiency. First, using region-specific retrograde disruption of CA projections, we show that PVT CA inputs mainly arise from the hindbrain, notably the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Second, taking advantage of integrative calorimetric measurements of metabolic efficiency, we reveal that CA inputs to the PVT scale adaptive feeding and metabolic responses in environmental, behavioral, physiological and metabolic stress-like contexts. Third, we show that hindbrainTH[-&gt;]PVT inputs contribute in modulating the activity of PVT as well as lateral (LH) and dorsomedial (DMH) hypothalamic neurons.\n\nIn conclusion, this study, by assessing the key role of CA inputs to the PVT in scaling homeostatic/allostatic regulations of feeding patterns, reveals the integrative and converging hindbrainTH[-&gt;]PVT paths that contribute to whole-body metabolic adaptations in stress-like contexts.\n\nKey pointsO_LIThe paraventricular thalamus (PVT) is known to receive projections from the hindbrain.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCervical transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a promising technology that can support motor function recovery of upper-limbs after spinal cord injury. Its efficacy may depend on the ability to recruit sensory afferents and convey excitatory inputs onto motoneurons. Therefore, understanding its physiological mechanisms is critical to accelerate its development towards clinical applications. In this study, we used an anatomically realistic computational model of the cervical spine to compare -motor, A-sensory, and A{beta}-sensory fiber activation thresholds and activation sites.\n\nApproachWe developed a tridimensional geometry of the cervical body and tSCS electrodes with a cathode centred at the C7 spinous process and an anode placed over the anterior neck. The geometrical model was used to estimate the electric potential distributions along motor and sensory fiber trajectories at the C7 spinal level using a finite element method. We implemented dedicated motor and sensory fiber models to simulate the -motor and A-sensory fibers using 12, 16, and 20 m diameter fibers, and A{beta}-sensory fibers using 6, 9, and 12 m diameter fibers. We estimated nerve fiber activation thresholds and sites for a 2 ms monophasic stimulating pulse and compared them across the fiber groups.\n\nMain resultsOur results showed lower activation thresholds of A- and A{beta}-sensory fibers compared with -motor fibers, suggesting preferential sensory fiber activation. We also found no differences between activation thresholds of A-sensory and large A{beta}-sensory fibers, implying they were co-activated. The activation sites were located at the dorsal and ventral root levels.\n\nSignificanceUsing a realistic computational model, we demonstrated preferential activation of dorsal root A- and A{beta}-sensory fibers compared with ventral root -motor fibers during cervical tSCS. These findings suggest high proprioceptive and cutaneous contributions to neural activations during cervical tSCS, which inform the underlying mechanisms of upper-limb functional motor recovery.",

    "abstract": "Several mathematical models to predict tumor growth over time have been developed in the last decades. A central aspect of such models is the interaction of tumor cells with immune effector cells. The Kuznetsov model (Kuznetsov et al. (1994), Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, vol. 56, no. 2, pp. 295-321) is the most prominent of these models and has been used as a basis for many other related models and theoretical studies. However, none of these models have been validated with large-scale real-world data of human patients treated with cancer immunotherapy. In addition, parameter estimation of these models remains a major bottleneck on the way to model-based and data-driven medical treatment. In this study, we quantitatively fit Kuznetsovs model to a large dataset of 1472 patients, of which 210 patients have more than six data points, by estimating the model parameters of each patient individually. We also conduct a global practical identifiability analysis for the estimated parameters. We thus demonstrate that several combinations of parameter values could lead to accurate data fitting. This opens the potential for global parameter estimation of the model, in which the values of all parameters are fixed for all patients. Furthermore, by omitting the last two or three data points, we show that the model can be extrapolated and predict future tumor dynamics. This paves the way for a more clinically relevant application of mathematical tumor modeling, in which the treatment strategy could be adjusted in advance according to the models future predictions.",

    "abstract": "We built a method of sequence-structure alignment (called CRFalign) which improves upon a base alignment model based on HMM-HMM comparison by employing pairwise conditional random fields (pCRF) in combination with nonlinear scoring functions of structural and sequence features. The total scoring function consists of a base scoring part based on HMM-HMM profile comparison plus additional nonlinear scoring part which is implemented by a set of gradient boosted regression trees. In addition to sequence profile features, various structural features are employed including secondary structures, solvent accessibilities, environment-dependent properties that give rise to position-dependent as well as environment-dependent match scores and gap penalties. Training is performed on reference alignments at superfamily levels or twilight zone chosen from the SABmark benchmark set. We found that our alignment method produce relative improvement in terms of average alignment accuracies, especially for the alignment of remote homologous proteins. We found that our alignment method produced (by using Modeller) better modeling results especially in the relatively hard targets compared with other methods. CRFalign was successfully applied to the stages of fold recognition and multiple sequence alignment in CASP11 and CASP12 competition on protein structure predictions.",

    "abstract": "The size of genetic databases has grown large enough such that, genetic genealogical search, a process of inferring familial relatedness by identifying DNA matches, has become a viable approach to help individuals finding missing family members or law enforcement agencies locating suspects. However, a fast and accurate method is needed to search an out-of-database individual against millions of individuals in such databases. Most existing approaches only offer all-vs-all within panel match. Some prototype algorithms offer 1-vs-all query from out-of-panel individual, but they do not tolerate errors. A new method, random projection-based identical-by-descent (IBD) detection (RaPID) query, referred as RaPID-Query, is introduced to make fast genealogical search possible. RaPID-Query method identifies IBD segments between a query haplotype and a panel of haplotypes. By integrating matches over multiple PBWT indexes, RaPID-Query method is able to locate IBD segments quickly with a given cutoff length while allowing mismatched sites in IBD segments. A single query against all UK biobank autosomal chromosomes can be completed within 2.76 seconds CPU time on average, with the minimum 7 cM IBD segment length and minimum 700 markers. Using the same criteria, RaPID-Query can achieve 0.099 false negative rate and 0.017 false positive rate at the same time on a chromosome 20 sequencing panel having 92,296 sites, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art IBD detection method Hap-IBD. For the relatedness degree separation experiments, RaPID-Query is able to distinguish up to fourth degree of the familial relatedness for a given individual pair, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values are at least 97.28%. It is anticipated that RaPID-Query will make genealogical search convenient and effective, potentially with the integration of complex inference models.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in synthetic biology have enabled the design of genetic feedback control circuits that could be implemented to build resilient plants against pathogen attacks. To facilitate the proper design of these genetic feedback control circuits, an accurate model that is able to capture the vital dynamical behaviour of the pathogen-infected plant is required. In this study, using a data-driven modelling approach, we develop and compare four dynamical models (i.e. linear, Michaelis-Menten, standard S-System and extended S-System) of a pathogen-infected plant gene regulatory network (GRN). These models are then assessed across several criteria, i.e. ease of identifying the type of gene regulation, the predictive capability, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the robustness to parameter uncertainty to determine its viability of modelling the pathogen-infected plant GRN. Using our defined ranking score, our analyses show that while the extended S-System model ranks highest in the overall comparison, the performance of the linear model is more consistent throughout the comparison, making it the preferred model for this pathogen-infected plant GRN.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells show intrinsic interferon signalling, which protects them from viral infections at all ages. In the ageing brain, interferon signalling in stem cells also reduces their ability to activate. Whether these functions are linked and at what time interferons start taking on a role in stem cell functioning is unknown. Additionally, the molecular link between interferons and activation in neural stem cells and how this relates to productivity is not well understood. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics, RiboSeq and animal models of interferon to show that this pathway is important for proper stem cell function at all ages. Interferon orchestrates cell cycle and mTOR activity to post-transcriptionally repress Sox2 and drive the exit from stem cell activation. The interferon response then decreases in the subsequent maturation states. Mathematical simulations indicate that this regulation is beneficial for the young and harmful for the old brain. Our study establishes molecular mechanisms of interferon in stem cells and interferons as genuine regulators of stem cell homeostasis and a potential therapeutic target to repair the ageing brain.",

We developed a biophysically detailed multiscale model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) with over 10,000 neurons and 30 million synapses. Neuron types, densities, spatial distributions, morphologies, biophysics, connectivity and dendritic synapse locations were tightly constrained by experimental data. The model includes long-range inputs from 7 thalamic and cortical regions, as well as noradrenergic inputs from locus coeruleus. Connectivity depended on cell class and cortical depth at sublaminar resolution. The model accurately predicted in vivo layer- and cell type-specific responses (firing rates and LFP) associated with behavioral states (quiet wakefulness and movement) and experimental manipulations (noradrenaline receptor blocking and thalamus inactivation). It also enabled evaluation of multiple mechanistic hypotheses underlying the observed activity. This quantitative theoretical framework can be used to integrate and interpret M1 experimental data and sheds light on the cell type-specific multiscale dynamics associated with a range of experimental conditions and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative tauopathies such as Alzheimers disease (AD) are caused by brain accumulation of tau assemblies. Evidence suggests tau functions as a prion, and cells and animals efficiently propagate unique tau assemblies. This suggests a dedicated cellular replication machinery, with normal physiologic function for tau seeds. Consequently, we hypothesized that healthy control brains would have seeding activity. We recently developed a novel monoclonal antibody (MD3.1) specific for tau seeds. We used this antibody to immunopurify tau from the parietal and cerebellar cortices of 19 healthy subjects ranging 19-65 years. We detected seeding in the parietal cortex, but not in the cerebellum, or in wild-type or human tau knockin mice, suggesting that cellular/genetic context dictates development of seed-competent tau. Seeding did not correlate with subject age or brain tau levels. Dot blot analyses revealed no AT8 immunoreactivity above background levels in parietal and cerebellar extracts and <1/100 of that present in AD. Based on binding to a panel of antibodies, the conformational characteristics of control seeds differed from AD, suggesting a unique underlying assembly, or structural ensemble. Taus ability to adopt self-replicating conformations under non-pathogenic conditions may reflect normal function that goes awry in disease states.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models have been hailed as a breakthrough for understanding disease and developing new therapeutics. The major advantage of iPSC-derived neurons is that they carry the genetic background of the donor, and as such could be more predictive for clinical translation. However, the development of these cell models is time-consuming and expensive and it is thus critical to maximize biomarker readout from every model that is developed. One option is to use a highly multiplexed biomarker imaging assay, like CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX), which allows detection of 50+ targets in situ at single-cell resolution.\n\nNew MethodThis paper describes the development of CODEX in neuronal cell cultures derived from human iPSCs.\n\nResultsWe differentiated human iPSCs into mixed neuronal and glial cultures on glass coverslips. We then developed and optimized a panel of 21 antibodies to phenotype iPSC-derived neuronal subtypes of cortical, dopaminergic, and striatal neurons, as well as astrocytes, and pre-and postsynaptic proteins.\n\nComparison with existing methodsCompared to standard immunocytochemistry, CODEX oligoconjugated fluorophores circumvent antibody host interactions and allow for highly customized multiplexing.\n\nConclusionWe show that CODEX can be applied to iPSC neuronal cultures and developed fixation and staining protocols for the neurons to sustain the multiple wash-stain cycles of the technology. Furthermore, we demonstrate both cellular and subcellular resolution imaging of multiplexed biomarkers in the same samples. CODEX is a powerful technique that complements other single-cell omics technologies for in-depth phenotype analysis.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/479039v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68d49dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ea424org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a763forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7950fc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOC_FLOATNO CODEX(R) Multiplex Imaging in human iPSC neurons\n\n[A-D] Schematic drawings of the tools and steps used for Co-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) imaging.

    "abstract": "We developed a biophysically-detailed model of the macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits, including primary auditory cortex (A1), medial geniculate body (MGB) and thalamic reticular nuclei (TRN), using the NEURON simulator and NetPyNE multiscale modeling tool. We simulated A1 as a cortical column with a depth of 2000 m and 200 m diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Neuron densities, laminar locations, classes, morphology and biophysics, and connectivity at the long-range, local and dendritic scale were derived from published experimental data. The A1 model included 6 cortical layers and multiple populations of neurons consisting of 4 excitatory and 4 inhibitory types, and was reciprocally connected to the thalamus (MGB and TRN), mimicking anatomical connectivity. MGB included core and matrix thalamocortical neurons with layer-specific projection patterns to A1, and thalamic interneurons projecting locally. Auditory stimulus-related inputs to the MGB were simulated using phenomenological models of the cochlear/auditory nerve and the inferior colliculus. The model generated cell type and layer-specific firing rates consistent with experimentally observed ranges, and accurately simulated the corresponding local field potentials (LFPs), current source density (CSD), and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Laminar CSD patterns during spontaneous activity, and in response to speech input, were similar to those recorded experimentally. Physiological oscillations emerged spontaneously across frequency bands without external rhythmic inputs and were comparable to those recorded in vivo. We used the model to unravel the contributions from distinct cell type and layer-specific neuronal populations to oscillation events detected in CSD, and explored how these relate to the population firing patterns. Overall, the computational model provides a quantitative theoretical framework to integrate and interpret a wide range of experimental data in auditory circuits. It also constitutes a powerful tool to evaluate hypotheses and make predictions about the cellular and network mechanisms underlying common experimental measurements, including MUA, LFP and EEG signals.",

    "abstract": "The inferior colliculus (IC) is a midbrain hub critical for perceiving complex sounds such as speech. In addition to processing ascending inputs from most auditory brainstem nuclei, the IC receives descending inputs from auditory cortex that control IC neuron feature selectivity, plasticity, and certain forms of perceptual learning. Although corticofugal synapses primarily release the excitatory transmitter glutamate, many physiology studies show that auditory cortical activity has a net inhibitory effect on IC neuron spiking. Perplexingly, anatomy studies imply that corticofugal axons primarily target glutamatergic IC neurons while only sparsely innervating IC GABA neurons.\n\nCorticofugal inhibition of the IC may thus occur largely independently of feedforward activation of local GABA neurons. We shed light on this paradox using in vitro electrophysiology in acute IC slices from fluorescent reporter mice of either sex. Using optogenetic stimulation of corticofugal axons, we find that excitation evoked with single light flashes is indeed stronger in presumptive glutamatergic neurons compared to GABAergic neurons. However, many IC GABA neurons fire tonically at rest, such that sparse and weak excitation suffices to significantly increase their spike rates.\n\nFurthermore, a subset of glutamatergic IC neurons fire spikes during repetitive corticofugal activity, leading to polysynaptic excitation in IC GABA neurons owing to a dense intra-collicular connectivity. Consequently, recurrent excitation amplifies corticofugal activity, drives spikes in IC GABA neurons, and generates substantial local inhibition in the IC. Thus, descending signals engage intra-collicular inhibitory circuits despite apparent constraints of monosynaptic connectivity between auditory cortex and IC GABA neurons.\n\nSignificance StatementDescending \"corticofugal\" projections are ubiquitous across mammalian sensory systems, and enable the neocortex to control subcortical activity in a predictive or feedback manner. Although corticofugal neurons are glutamatergic, neocortical activity often inhibits subcortical neuron spiking. How does an excitatory pathway generate inhibition? Here we study the corticofugal pathway from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus (IC), a midbrain hub important for complex sound perception. Surprisingly, cortico-collicular transmission was stronger onto IC glutamatergic compared to GABAergic neurons. However, corticofugal activity triggered spikes in IC glutamate neurons with local axons, thereby generating strong polysynaptic excitation and feed-forward spiking of GABAergic neurons. Our results thus reveal a novel mechanism that recruits local inhibition despite limited monosynaptic convergence onto inhibitory networks.",

    "abstract": "The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mammals is critically important in the perception of touch and related sensorimotor behaviors. In 2015, the Blue Brain Project developed a groundbreaking rat S1 microcircuit simulation with over 31,000 neurons with 207 morpho-electrical neuron types, and 37 million synapses, incorporating anatomical and physiological information from a wide range of experimental studies. We have implemented this highly-detailed and complex S1 model in NetPyNE, using the data available in the Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal. NetPyNE provides a Python high-level interface to NEURON and allows defining complicated multiscale models using an intuitive declarative standardized language. It also facilitates running parallel simulations, automates the optimization and exploration of parameters using supercomputers, and provides a wide range of built-in analysis functions. This will make the S1 model more accessible and simpler to scale, modify and extend in order to explore research questions or interconnect to other existing models. Despite some implementation differences, the NetPyNE model preserved the original cell morphologies, electrophysiological responses and spatial distribution for all 207 cell types; and the connectivity properties of all 1941 pathways, including synaptic dynamics and short-term plasticity (STP). The NetPyNE S1 simulations produced reasonable physiological firing rates and activity patterns across all populations. The network generated a 1 Hz oscillation comparable to the original model in vitro-like state. By then reducing the extracellular calcium concentration, the model reproduced the original S1 in vivo-like states with asynchronous activity. These results validate the original study using a new modeling tool. Simulated local field potentials (LFPs) exhibited realistic oscillatory patterns and features, including distance- and frequency-dependent attenuation. The model was extended by adding thalamic circuits, including 6 distinct thalamic populations with intrathalamic, thalamocortical and corticothalamic connectivity derived from experimental data. The thalamic model reproduced single known cell and circuit-level dynamics, including burst and tonic firing modes and oscillatory patterns, providing a more realistic input to cortex and enabling study of thalamocortical interactions. Overall, our work provides a widely accessible, data-driven and biophysically-detailed model of the somatosensory thalamocortical circuits that can be employed as a community tool for researchers to study neural dynamics, function and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA major challenge in neurodegenerative diseases concerns identifying biological disease signatures that track with disease progression or respond to an intervention. Several clinical trials in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disease, are currently ongoing. Therefore, we examined whether peripheral tissues can serve as a source of readily accessible biological signatures at the RNA and protein level in HD patients.\n\nResultsWe generated large, high-quality human datasets from skeletal muscle, skin and adipose tissue to probe molecular changes in human premanifest and early manifest HD patients - those most likely involved in clinical trials. In-depth single nucleotide polymorphism data across the HTT gene will facilitate the use of the generated primary- and iPSC cell lines in allele-specific targeting approaches. The analysis of the transcriptomics and proteomics data shows robust, stage-dependent dysregulation. Gene ontology analysis confirmed the involvement of inflammation and energy metabolism in peripheral HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we observed changes in the homeostasis of extracellular vesicles, where we found consistent changes of genes and proteins involved in this process.\n\nConclusionsOur  omics data document the involvement of inflammation, energy metabolism and extracellular vesicle homeostasis. This demonstrates the potential to identify biological signatures from peripheral tissues in HD suitable as biomarkers in clinical trials. Together with the primary cell lines established from peripheral tissues and a large panel of iPSC lines that can serve as human models of HD, the generated data are a valuable and unique resource to advance the current understanding of molecular mechanisms driving HD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been classified as a high priority pathogen by the World Health Organization underlining the high demand for new therapeutics to treat infections. Human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) is among the most potent bactericidal proteins against Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus. To determine hGIIA-resistance mechanisms of MRSA we screened the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library using a sublethal concentration of recombinant hGIIA. We identified and confirmed the role of lspA, encoding the lipoprotein signal peptidase LspA, as a new hGIIA resistance gene in both in vitro assays and an infection model in hGIIA-transgenic mice. Increased susceptibility of the lspA mutant was associated with faster and increased cell wall penetration of hGIIA. Moreover, lspA deletion also increased susceptibility to daptomycin, a last-resort antibiotic to treat MRSA infections. Exposure of MRSA wild-type to the LspA-specific inhibitors globomycin and myxovirescin A1 induced a lspA mutant phenotype with regard to hGIIA and daptomycin killing. Analysis of >26,000 S. aureus genomes showed that LspA is highly sequence-conserved, suggesting that LspA inhibition could be applied universally. The role of LspA in hGIIA resistance was not restricted to MRSA since Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis were also more hGIIA-susceptible after lspA deletion or LspA inhibition, respectively. Overall, our data suggest that pharmacological blocking of LspA may disarm Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, to enhance clearance by innate host defense molecules and clinically-applied antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "JAK3 is a member of the JAK family of tyrosine kinase proteins involved in cytokine receptor-mediated intracellular signal transduction through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. JAK3 was shown as differentially expressed in granulosa cells (GC) of bovine pre-ovulatory follicles suggesting that JAK3 could modulate GC function and activation/inhibition of downstream targets. We used JANEX-1, a JAK3 inhibitor, and FSH treatments and analyzed proliferation markers, steroidogenic enzymes and phosphorylation of target proteins including STAT3, CDKN1B/p27Kip1 and MAPK8IP3/JIP3. GC were treated with or without FSH in the presence or not of JANEX-1. Expression of steroidogenic enzyme CYP11A1, but not CYP19A1, was upregulated in GC treated with FSH and both were significantly decreased when JAK3 was inhibited. Proliferation markers CCND2 and PCNA were reduced in JANEX-1-treated GC and upregulated by FSH. Western blots analyses showed that JANEX-1 treatment reduced pSTAT3 amounts while JAK3 overexpression increased pSTAT3. Similarly, FSH treatment increased pSTAT3 even in JANEX-1-treated GC. UHPLC-MS/MS analyses revealed phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues within JAK3 as well as CDKN1B and MAPK8IP3 suggesting possible activation or inhibition post-FSH or JANEX-1 treatments. We show that FSH activates JAK3 in GC, which could phosphorylate target proteins and likely modulate other signaling pathways involving CDKN1B and MAPK8IP3.",

Here we analyse a global dataset of over 7000 marine, freshwater, and terrestrial vertebrate populations, alongside trait, threat and geographical data, to identify the factors influencing the number of threats a species is subjected to at the population level. Out of a suite of predictors tested, we find that body mass and latitude both are broadly available for vertebrate species, and influence the number of threats a population is subjected to. Larger bodied species and those nearer the equator are typically affected by a higher number of threats. However, whilst this pattern broadly holds across ecosystems for most taxa, amphibians and reptiles show opposing trends. We suggest that latitude and body mass should be considered as key predictors to identify which vertebrate populations are likely to be impacted by multiple threats. These general predictors can help to better understand the impacts of the Anthropocene on global vertebrate biodiversity and design effective conservation policies.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern that has prompted a renewed focus on drug discovery, stewardship, and evolutionary studies of the patterns and processes that underlie this phenomenon. A resistant strains competitive fitness relative to its sensitive counterparts in the absence of drug can impact its spread and persistence in both clinical and community settings. In a prior study, we examined the fitness of tetracycline-resistant clones that evolved from five different Escherichia coli genotypes, which had diverged during a long-term evolution experiment. In this study, we build on that work to examine whether ampicillin-resistant mutants are also less fit in the absence of the drug than their sensitive parents, and whether the cost of resistance is constant or variable among independently derived lines. Like the tetracycline-resistant lines, the ampicillin-resistant mutants were often less fit than their sensitive parents, with significant variation in the fitness costs among the mutants. This variation was not associated with the level of resistance conferred by the mutations, nor did it vary across the different parental backgrounds. In our earlier study, some of the variation in fitness costs associated with tetracycline resistance was explained by the effects of different mutations affecting the same cellular pathway and even the same gene. In contrast, the variance among the ampicillin-resistant mutants was associated with different sets of target genes. About half of the resistant clones suffered large fitness deficits, and their mutations impacted major outer-membrane proteins or subunits of RNA polymerases. The other mutants experienced little or no fitness costs and with, one exception, they had mutations affecting other genes and functions. Our findings underscore the importance of comparative studies on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, and they highlight the nuanced processes that shape these phenotypes.",

Our results indicate the presence of high steppe ancestry in the Somogyvar-Vinkovci culture. They were then replaced by the Kisapostag group, who exhibit an outstandingly high (up to [~]47%) Mesolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry, despite this component being thought to be highly diluted by the time of the Early Bronze Age. The Kisapostag population contributed the genetic basis for the succeeding community of the Encrusted pottery culture. We also found an elevated hunter-gatherer component in a local Baden culture associated individual, but no connections were proven to the Bronze Age individuals. The hunter-gatherer ancestry in Kisapostag is likely derived from two main sources, one from a Funnelbeaker or Globular Amphora culture related population and one from a previously unrecognised source in Eastern Europe. We show that this ancestry not only appeared in various groups in Bronze Age Central Europe, but also made contributions to Baltic populations. The social structure of Kisapostag and Encrusted pottery cultures is patrilocal, similarly to most contemporaneous groups. Furthermore, we developed new methods and method standards for computational analyses of ancient DNA, implemented to our newly developed and freely available bioinformatic package. By analysing clinical traits, we found carriers of aneuploidy and inheritable genetic diseases. Finally, based on genetic and anthropological data, we present here the first female facial reconstruction from the Bronze Age Carpathian Basin.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a substantial global health burden with 229 million cases in 2019 and 450,000 deaths annually. Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread malaria-causing parasite putting 2.5 billion people at risk of infection. P. vivax has a dormant liver stage and therefore can exist for long periods undetected. Its blood-stage can cause severe reactions and hospitalization. Few treatment and detection options are available for this pathogen. To address this need, we developed nanomolar inhibitor that could serve as a therapeutic and a diagnostic. A unique characteristic of P. vivax is that it depends on the Duffy antigen/Receptor for chemokines (DARC) on the surface of host red blood cells for invasion. P. vivax employs the Duffy binding protein (DBP) to bind to DARC. We first de novo designed a three helical bundle scaffolding database which was screened via protease digestions for stability. Protease-resistant scaffolds highlighted thresholds for stability, which we utilized for selecting DARC mimetics that we subsequentially designed through grafting and redesign of these scaffolds. The optimized design small helical protein disrupts the DBP:DARC interaction. The inhibitor blocks the receptor binding site on DBP and thus forms a strong foundation for a therapeutic that will inhibit reticulocyte infection and prevent the pathogenesis of P. vivax malaria.\n\nTeaserDe novo designed proteins present a new alternative for the development of therapeutics. They can be small, highly stable and easily manufactured. Here we designed a potential new therapeutic to inhibit entry of Plasmodium vivax into red blood cells by interfering its interactions of surface displayed DBP molecules with the host receptor DARC.",

However, small reference databases may not be sufficiently representative of the diversity of lineages and genotypes present in a collection of isolates. In this study, we explore the use of genomic neighbor typing for surveillance of community-associated Staphylococcus aureus outbreaks in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Far North Queensland, Australia (FNQ). We developed Sketchy, an implementation of genomic neighbor typing that queries exhaustive whole genome reference databases using MinHash. Evaluations were conducted using nanopore read simulations and six species-wide reference sketches (4832 - 47616 genomes), as well as two S. aureus outbreak data sets sequenced at low depth using a sequential multiplex library protocol on the MinION (n = 160, with matching Illumina data). Heuristic inference of lineages and antimicrobial resistance profiles allowed us to conduct multiplex genotyping in situ at the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research in Goroka, on low-throughput Flongle adapters and using multiple successive libraries on the same MinION flow cell (n = 24 - 48). Comparison to phylogenetically informed genomic neighbor typing with RASE on the dominant outbreak sequence type suggests slightly better performance at predicting lineage-scale genotypes using large sketch sizes, but inferior performance in resolving clade-specific genotypes (methicillin resistance). Sketchy can be used for large-scale bacterial outbreak surveillance and in challenging sequencing scenarios, but improvements to clade-specific genotype inference are needed for diagnostic applications.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer have emerged as dominant tools for AI-driven drug discovery. Many state-of-the-art methods first pre-train GNNs or the hybrid of GNNs and Transformer on a large molecular database and then fine-tune on downstream tasks. However, different from other domains such as computer vision (CV) or natural language processing (NLP), getting labels for molecular data of downstream tasks often requires resource-intensive wet-lab experiments. Besides, the pre-trained models are often of extremely high complexity with huge parameters. These often cause the fine-tuned model to over-fit the training data of downstream tasks and significantly deteriorate the performance. To alleviate these critical yet under-explored issues, we propose two straightforward yet effective strategies to attain better generalization performance: 1. MolAug, which enriches the molecular datasets of down-stream tasks with chemical homologies and enantiomers; 2. WordReg, which controls the complexity of the pre-trained models with a smoothness-inducing regularization built on dropout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed strategies achieve notable and consistent improvements over vanilla fine-tuning and yield multiple state-of-the-art results. Also, these strategies are model-agnostic and readily pluggable into fine-tuning of various pre-trained molecular graph models. We will release the code and the fine-tuned models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) is the largest adipose deposit in the knee; however, its contributions to the homeostasis of this organ remain unknown. To determine the influence of this depot on joint health, this study determined the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) following excision of the IFP in a rodent model of naturally-occurring disease.\n\nMethodsMale Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (n=10) received surgical removal of the IFP in one knee at 3 months of age; contralateral knees received sham surgery as matched internal controls. Treadmill-based gait analysis was performed prior to IFP removal and monthly thereafter. Animals were harvested at 7 months of age. Both knees were processed for microcomputed tomography (microCT), histopathology, transcript expression analyses, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\nResultsFibrous connective tissue (FCT) developed in place of the native fat pad. Gait demonstrated no significant differences between IFP removal and contralateral limbs. MicroCT OA scores were improved in knees with the FCT. Histopathology confirmed maintenance of articular cartilage structure, proteoglycan content, and chondrocyte cellularity in FCT-containing knees. Transcript analyses revealed decreased expression of adipose-related molecules and inflammatory mediators in FCTs compared to IFPs. This was corroborated via IHC for select inflammatory mediators.\n\nDiscussion/ConclusionFormation of the FCT resulted in reduced OA-associated changes in both bone and cartilage. A decrease in inflammatory mediators at transcript and protein levels may be associated with these improvements.

    "abstract": "Transport of water, ions and signals from roots to leaves via the xylem vessels is essential for plant life and needs to be tightly regulated. The final composition of the transpiration stream before passage into the shoots is controlled by the xylem-adjacent cell layers, namely xylem parenchyma and pericycle, in the upper part of the root. To unravel regulatory networks in this strategically important location, we generated Arabidopsis lines expressing a nuclear tag under the control of the HKT1 promoter. HKT1 retrieves sodium from the xylem to prevent toxic levels in the shoot, and this function depends on its specific expression in upper root xylem-adjacent tissues. Based on FACS RNA-sequencing and INTACT ChIP-sequencing, we identified the gene repertoire that is preferentially expressed in the tagged cell types and discovered transcription factors experiencing cell-type specific loss of H3K27me3 demethylation. For one of these, ZAT6, we show that H3K27me3-demethylase REF6 is required for de-repression. Analysis of zat6 mutants revealed that ZAT6 activates a suite of cell-type specific downstream genes and restricts Na+ accumulation in the shoots. The combined Files open novel opportunities for  bottom-up causal dissection of cell-type specific regulatory networks that control root-to-shoot communication under environmental challenge.",

    "abstract": "Visceral pain is a leading cause of morbidity in gastrointestinal diseases, which is exacerbated by the gut related side-effects of many analgesics. New treatments are needed and further understanding of the mediators and mechanisms underpinning visceral nociception in disease states is required to facilitate this. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF is linked to pain in both patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, and has been shown to sensitise colonic sensory neurons. Somatic, TNF- triggered thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity is mediated by TRPV1 signalling and p38 MAPK activity respectively, downstream of TNFR1 receptor activation. We therefore hypothesised that TNFR1-evoked p38 MAPK activity may also be responsible for TNF sensitisation of colonic afferent responses to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, and noxious distension of the bowel. Using Ca2+ imaging of dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons, we observed TNF-mediated increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and sensitisation of capsaicin responses. The sensitising effects of TNF were dependent on TNFR1 expression and attenuated by p38 MAPK inhibition. Consistent with these findings, ex vivo colonic afferent fibre recordings demonstrated enhanced response to noxious ramp distention of the bowel and bath application of capsaicin following TNF pre-treatment. Responses were reversed by p38 MAPK inhibition and absent in tissue from TNFR1 knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate a contribution of TNFR1, p38 MAPK and TRPV1 to TNF-induced sensitisation of colonic afferents, highlighting the potential utility of these drug targets for the treatment of visceral pain in GI disease.\n\nAbstract figure legendTNF sensitised Ca2+ responses to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. Sensitisation was TNFR1-dependent and attenuated by inhibition of p38 MAPK. Direct Ca2+ responses to TNF were TRPV1-and TRPA1-dependent. In ex vivo colonic afferent recordings, TNF increased sensitivity to noxious ramp distension and capsaicin, both of which were absent in TNFR1-/- tissue or blocked by inhibition of p38 MAPK. These findings establish a role for TNFR1, p38 MAPK and TRPV1 in TNF-mediated sensitisation of colonic afferents.\n\nKey Points SummaryO_LITNF sensitises sensory neurons and colonic afferents to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin.\nC_LIO_LITNF-mediated sensitisation of sensory neurons and colonic nociceptors is dependent on TNFR1 expression.\nC_LIO_LITNF sensitisation of sensory neurons and colonic afferents to capsaicin and noxious ramp distension is abolished by inhibition of p38 MAPK.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "When listening to continuous speech, the human brain can track features of the presented speech signal. It has been shown that neural tracking of acoustic features is a prerequisite for speech understanding and can predict speech understanding in controlled circumstances. However, the brain also tracks linguistic features of speech, which may be more directly related to speech understanding. We investigated acoustic and linguistic speech processing as a function of varying speech understanding by manipulating the speech rate. In this paradigm, acoustic and linguistic speech processing are affected simultaneously but in opposite directions: When the speech rate increases, more acoustic information per second is present. In contrast, the tracking of linguistic information becomes more challenging when speech is less intelligible at higher speech rates. We measured the EEG of 18 participants (4 male) who listened to speech at various speech rates. As expected and confirmed by the behavioral results, speech understanding decreased with increasing speech rate. Accordingly, linguistic neural tracking decreased with increasing speech rate, but acoustic neural tracking increased. This indicates that neural tracking of linguistic representations can capture the gradual effect of decreasing speech understanding. In addition, increased acoustic neural tracking does not necessarily imply better speech understanding. This suggests that, although more challenging to measure due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, linguistic neural tracking may be a more direct predictor of speech understanding.\n\nSignificance statementAn increasingly popular method to investigate neural speech processing is to measure neural tracking. Although much research has been done on how the brain tracks acoustic speech features, linguistic speech features have received less attention. In this study, we disentangled acoustic and linguistic characteristics of neural speech tracking via manipulating the speech rate. A proper way of objectively measuring auditory and language processing paves the way towards clinical applications: An objective measure of speech understanding would allow for behavioral-free evaluation of speech understanding, which allows to evaluate hearing loss and adjust hearing aids based on brain responses. This objective measure would benefit populations from whom obtaining behavioral measures may be complex, such as young children or people with cognitive impairments.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene are one of the common predictors of neurodevelopmental disorders, commonly resulting in individuals developing autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and sleep deficits. EEG recordings in neurodevelopmental disorders show potential to identify clinically translatable biomarkers to both diagnose and track the progress of novel therapeutic strategies, as well as providing insight into underlying pathological mechanisms. In a rat model of SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in which the exons encoding the calcium/lipid binding and GTPase activating protein (GAP) domains have been deleted (Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP) we analysed the duration and occurrence of wake, non rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) brain states during 6 hour multi-electrode EEG recordings. We find that although Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP animals spend an equivalent percent time in wake and sleep states, they have an abnormal brain state distribution as the number of wake and NREM bouts are reduced and there is an increase in the average duration of both wake and NREM epochs. We perform connectivity analysis by calculating the average imaginary coherence between electrode pairs at varying distance thresholds during these states. In group averages from pairs of electrodes at short distances from each other, a clear reduction in connectivity during NREM is present between 11.5 Hz and 29.5 Hz, a frequency range that overlaps with sleep spindles, oscillatory phenomena thought to be important for normal brain function and memory consolidation. Sleep spindles occurrence, amplitude, power and spread across multiple electrodes were not reduced in Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP rats, with only a small decrease in duration detected. Nonetheless, by analysing the dynamic imaginary coherence during sleep spindles, we found a reduction in high connectivity instances between short-distance electrode pairs. Finally, by comparing the dynamic imaginary coherence during sleep spindles between individual electrode pairs, we identified a group of channels over the right somatosensory, association and visual cortices that have a significant reduction in connectivity during sleep spindles in mutant animals. These data suggest that Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP rats have altered brain state dynamics and EEG connectivity, which may have clinical relevance for SYNGAP haploinsufficiency in humans.",

Here, we utilized auxilin-knockout (KO) mice to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxilin deficiency and clathrin-uncoating deficits lead to PD. We demonstrate that auxilin KO mice display the cardinal features of PD, including progressive motor deficits, -synuclein pathology, nigral dopaminergic loss, and neuroinflammation. Through unbiased proteomic and neurochemical analyses, we demonstrate that dopamine homeostasis is disrupted in auxilin KO brains, including via slower dopamine reuptake kinetics in vivo, an effect associated with dopamine transporter misrouting into axonal membrane deformities in the dorsal striatum. We also show that elevated macroautophagy and defective SV protein sorting contribute to ineffective dopamine sequestration and homeostasis, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration.

Using cerebral spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we investigated the effects of increased neuronal activity on neurogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that increasing neuronal activity with 4-aminopyridine in 3-month-old cerebral spheroids is associated with increases in the numbers of new neurons and decreases in the population of new glial cells. We also observed a significant decrease in the expression of miR-135a, which has previously been shown to be decreased in exercise-induced neurogenesis. Predicted targets of miR-135a include key participants in the SMAD2/3 and BDNF pathways. Together, our results suggest that iPSC-derived cerebral spheroids are an attractive model to study some aspects of activity-induced neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Opioid addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder. Whether addicted individuals are forced to abstain or they decide themselves to quit using drugs, relapse rates are high--especially upon encountering contexts and stimuli associated with prior opioid use. Rodents similarly show context- and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking following abstinence, and intriguingly, the neural circuits underlying these relapse-like behaviors differ when abstinence is involuntarily imposed, versus when animals decide themselves to cease taking drug. Here, we employ two complementary rat behavioral models of relapse-like behavior for the highly reinforcing opioid drug remifentanil, and asked whether GABAergic neurons in the ventral pallidum (VPGABA) control opioid seeking under these behavioral conditions. Specifically, we asked how chemogenetically stimulating VPGABA neurons with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) influences the ability of contextual or discrete remifentanil-paired cues to reinstate drug seeking following either voluntary (punishment-induced; GroupPunish), or experimenter-imposed (extinction training; GroupExt) abstinence. In GroupPunish rats, we also chemogenetically inhibited VPGABA neurons, and examined spontaneous VP activity (Fos) during cued-reinstatement. In both GroupPunish and GroupExt rats, stimulating Gq-signaling in VPGABA neurons augmented remifentanil reinstatement in a cue- and context-dependent manner. Conversely, engaging inhibitory Gi-signaling in VPGABA neurons in GroupPunish suppressed cue-induced reinstatement, and additionally cue-triggered seeking was correlated with Fos in rostral, but not caudal VP. In contrast, neither stimulating nor inhibiting VPGABA neurons influenced unpunished remifentanil self-administration. We conclude that VPGABA neurons bidirectionally control opioid seeking regardless of the specific relapse model employed, highlighting their fundamental role in opioid relapse-like behavior across behavioral models, and potentially across species.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe acutely inhibit or stimulate VP GABA neurons during opioid seeking\nC_LIO_LIVP GABA neurons mediate relapse-like behavior across behavioral models\nC_LIO_LIBehavioral context impacts DREADD stimulation of behavior, not VP activity\nC_LIO_LIRostral, not caudal VP Fos correlates with opioid reinstatement\nC_LI",

Membrane lipid composition has recently emerged as a key factor for stress adaptation.

Here we characterise the VWA domain-protein ViaA and its interaction with the AAA+ ATPase RavA, and find that both proteins localise at the inner cell membrane. We demonstrate that RavA and ViaA target specific phospholipids and subsequently identify their lipid-binding sites. We further show that mutations abolishing interaction with lipids restore induced changes in cell membrane morphology and lipid composition. Finally we reveal that these mutations render E. coli gentamicin-resistant under fumarate respiration conditions. Our work thus uncovers a ravA-viaA-based pathway which is mobilised in response to antibiotics under anaerobiosis and has a major impact on cell membrane regulation.",

These \"small phages\" are relatively rare and have received minimal study thus far. Of the actinobacteriophages published in PhagesDB.org, small phages have been isolated on Arthrobacter, Gordonia, Rhodococcus, and Microbacterium hosts. A previous study by Pope et al. showed that Gordonia small phages have similar gene products and amino acid sequences. Here, we set out to further examine relationships between small Gordonia phages as well as small phages that infect other hosts. Of the 3222 sequenced phages listed on PhagesDB, we identified 109 distinctly small phages with genome sizes under 20,000 bp. The majority of the small phages were isolated on Arthrobacter or Microbacterium hosts. Using comparative genomics, we searched for patterns of similarity among 34 cluster-representative small phages. Dot plot comparisons showed that there was more amino acid conservation than nucleotide identity amongst small phages. Gene content similarity (GCS) analysis revealed that the temperate Gordonia phages in Cluster CW share significant GCS values (over 35%) with the lytic Arthrobacter phages in Cluster AN, suggesting that some small phages have a considerable degree of genomic similarity with each other. SplitsTree analyses of shared phams (genes with substantial amino acid identity) supported the complexity of clustering criteria in small phages, given shuffling of genes across phages of different clusters and close relationships despite varied cluster membership. We observed this continuum of phage diversity through Rhodococcus phage RRH1s closer similarity to phages in Gordonia subcluster CW1 than CW1 is to Gordonia subcluster CW3. Finally, we were able to confirm the presence of conserved phams across not only small Gordonia phages but also within small phages from different clusters and hosts. Studying these genomic trends hidden in small phages allows us to better understand and appreciate the overall diversity of phages.",

In this study, Heteractis magnifica assemblages at Village Reef at Perhentian Kecil were monitored during May, July, and August of 2020, thus providing a first assessment of their abundance. Sea anemone formation size, individual size, habitat location, and hosting status of anemonefish were assessed. Results demonstrate significantly larger counts of individuals within aggregated formations in the patch reef as compared to the fringe reef, without the presence of larger individual sizes. In addition, Heteractis magnifica specimens that were actively hosting anemonefish had significantly larger cover, larger individual sizes, and demonstrated higher individual counts within their aggregated formations compared to non-hosting specimens. There was no significant overall effect of time on sea anemone growth throughout the monitoring period, nor were there any significant changes in abundance levels regarding formation make-up throughout the monitoring phase. However, time related effects where present upon data inspection per assessment period. The restricted time frame of the monitoring period could play a role in explaining the absence of overall time related effects. A prolonged monitoring will help to further understand Heteractis magnifica population dynamics at this location, which can increase knowledge capacity for reef management and conservation strategies.",

Although unprocessed sequence files are often publicly available, processed data, i.e. sequences clustered as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) are rarely at hand in a comparable format. This hampers comparative studies between different environments and datasets, for example examining the biogeographical patterns of specific groups/species, as well analysing the micro-genetic diversity within these groups. Here, we present a newly-assembled database of processed 18S rRNA metabarcodes that are annotated with the PR2 reference sequence database. This database, called metaPR2, contains 41 datasets corresponding to more than 4,000 samples and 73,000 ASVs. The database is accessible through both a web-based interface (https://shiny.metapr2.org) and as an R package, and should prove very useful to all researchers working on protist diversity in a variety of systems.",

    "abstract": "Parapatrically distributed taxa pose a challenge for species delimitation due to the presence of gene flow and inherent arbitrariness of exactly defining the species boundaries in such systems. We tackled the problem of species delimitation in a parapatric species pair of Melitaea butterflies using two popular genomic methods - double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) and target enrichment. The former is mainly applied at shallow phylogenetic scales and the latter at both deep and shallow scales. Although both of these methods have been adequately utilised for species delimitation purposes, there are only a handful of studies that have compared these two genomic approaches in the same study system. We applied phylogenetic, population genetic and species delimitation methods and compared the results obtained from the two approaches. Using a recently developed target enrichment probe kit, we were able to capture 1,743 loci with a low amount of missing data and compared these with already available ddRAD data from a previous study on the same set of specimens. We recovered consistent phylogenetic relationships across the datasets, both demonstrating the presence of a genetically distinct Balkan lineage and paraphyly of Melitaea athalia with respect to Melitaea celadussa. The same relationships were also found in a species tree analysis of the target enrichment dataset using ASTRAL. Population genetic STRUCTURE analyses supported the presence of two species when using ddRAD data, but three species when using target enrichment, while the Bayes factor delimitation analysis found both two and three species scenarios equally decisive in both datasets. From the geographic distribution of genomic admixture, we confirm the patterns observed by a previous study that used ddRAD data. As the results obtained from both methods were largely congruent, we discuss some practical considerations and benefits of target enrichment over RAD sequencing. We conclude that the choice of method of genomic data collection does not influence the results of phylogenetic analyses at alpha taxonomic level, given a sufficient number of loci. Finally, we recommend a solution for delineating species in parapatric scenarios by proposing that parapatric taxa be consistently classified as subspecies or complete species, but not both, to promote taxonomic stability.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive traits evolve rapidly between species. Understanding the causes and consequences of this rapid divergence requires characterization of male and female reproductive proteins and how their interaction mediates fertilisation success. Species in the Drosophila virilis clade exhibit interspecific postmating prezygotic reproductive isolation, making them ideal for studies on diversification of reproductive proteins and their role in speciation. Here we present a novel method to simultaneously identify and quantify transferred male ejaculate proteins and the female reproductive proteome using multiplexed Tandem-Mass-Tag (TMT) isobaric labelling of the lower female reproductive tract before and immediately after mating in three species of the virilis group. We identified over 200 putative male ejaculate proteins, many of which show differential abundance between species. We also identified over 2000 proteins that provide the first description of the female reproductive tract proteome outside of the D. melanogaster group. The female reproductive tract proteome shows significant divergence between species, especially female-specific serine-type endopeptidases, which showed differential abundance between species and elevated rates of molecular evolution that is similar to that of male seminal fluid proteins. We also found that only ~1/3 of male ejaculate proteins are likely produced in the accessory glands and code for a signal peptide sequence. Finally, we assessed the utility of species-specific compared to single species query databases for protein identification and quantification from multiple species samples. Our results show that using species-specific query databases dramatically improves protein identification and quantification.",

Cytoplasmic inheritance was considered based on maternal lineage information. For OC, estimated direct heritability was moderate (0.32) and estimated maternal heritability and proportion of the variance of cytoplasmic inheritance effects to the phenotypic variance were very low (both <0.03), implying that causal genes for OC could be located on autosomes. To assess this hypothesis, we attempted to identify possible candidate causal genes by performing pool-seq using pooled DNA samples from mice in high and low OC lines and selective signature detection. We made a list of possible candidate causal genes for OC, including those relating to electron transport chain and ATP-binging proteins (Ndufa12, Sdhc, Atp10b, etc.), Prr16 encoding Largen protein, Cry1 encoding a key component of the circadian core oscillator, and so on.

    "abstract": "Indirect development with an intermediate larva exists in all major animal lineages1, making larvae central to most scenarios of animal evolution2-12. Yet how larvae evolved remains disputed. Here we show that temporal shifts (i.e., heterochronies) in trunk formation underpin the diversification of larvae and bilaterian life cycles. Combining chromosome-scale genome sequencing in the slow-evolving annelid Owenia fusiformis13 with transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling during the life cycles of this and two other annelids, we found that trunk development is deferred to pre-metamorphic stages in the feeding larva of O. fusiformis, but starts after gastrulation in the non-feeding larva with gradual metamorphosis of Capitella teleta and the direct developing embryo of Dimorphilus gyrociliatus. Accordingly, the embryos of O. fusiformis develop first into an enlarged anterior domain that forms larval tissues and the adult head. Notably, this also occurs in the so-called \"head larvae\" of other bilaterians14,15, with whom O. fusiformis larva shows extensive transcriptomic similarities. Together, our findings suggest that the temporal decoupling of head and trunk formation, as maximally observed in \"head larvae\", allowed larval evolution in Bilateria, thus diverging from prevailing scenarios that propose either co-option10,11 or innovation12 of gene regulatory programmes to explain larva and adult origins.",

These aligned fibers can transmit traction forces, guide tumor cell migration, facilitate angiogenesis, and influence tissue morphogenesis. To create aligned COL1 domains in microfluidic cell culture models, shear flows have been used to align thin COL1 matrices (<50m in height) in a microchannel. However, there has been limited investigation into the role of shear flows in aligning 3D hydrogels (>130m). Here, we show that pure shear flows do not induce fiber alignment in 3D atelo COL1 hydrogels, but the simple addition of local extensional flow promotes alignment that is maintained across several millimeters, with a degree of alignment directly related to the extensional strain rate. We further advance experimental capabilities by addressing the practical challenge of accessing a 3D hydrogel formed within a microchannel by introducing a magnetically coupled modular platform that can be released to expose the microengineered hydrogel. We demonstrate the platforms capability to pattern cells and fabricate multi-layered COL1 matrices using layer-by-layer fabrication and specialized modules. Our approach provides an easy-to-use fabrication method to achieve advanced hydrogel microengineering capabilities that combine fiber alignment with biofabrication capabilities.",

Methods: Three-dimensional reconstructions of 11 carotid arteries were generated using patient-derived magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasound data. Computational fluid dynamic simulations were sequentially generated following computational stenosis assessment, and corresponding changes in OSI were observed and used as measure of morphological stabilization. Results: Six carotid models showed progressive stenosis with statistically significant increases in regions of high OSI (OSI > 0.2, p < 0.05) with eventual carotid occlusion in one of the cases. Three models remained free or nearly free of increased OSI, whereas one model showed an overall decrease in high OSI regions (p < 0.05) and another trended in that direction but did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.145). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first computational model describing progressive stenosis in any peripheral artery including the carotid. Taken together, this study provides a novel framework for computational hemodynamic investigations on progressive atherosclerosis in the carotid artery.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly and maturation proceeds in two distinct steps. During assembly, viral Gag oligomerizes into a hexagonal polyprotein lattice incorporating the capsid protein (CA) and spacer peptide 1 (SP1) domains, that constitute the immature Gag lattice. During maturation, CTD-SP1 hexamers formed in the previous step are cleaved by HIV-1 protease, causing a dramatic rearrangement of the immature virion to its mature, infectious form. The first-generation maturation inhibitor (MI) bevirimat (BVM) is reported to block the final cleavage between CA and SP1, thus blocking HIV maturation. In contrast, the host factor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is a co-factor of Gag assembly and facilitates the formation of a quaternary arrangement of SP1 known as the six helix bundle (6HB). Here, starting from a MAS NMR structure and using atomistic free energy calculations, we establish that binding of BVM and IP6 to the immature lattice lacks any cooperativity or avidity. Furthermore, we rationalize the molecular origin of HIV resistance to BVM by determining the role of BVM on the stability of the 6HB and by revealing that SP1 shows independent dynamics for its pre- and post-cleavage regions. Finally, results from our simulations permit us to propose a novel chemical scaffold for the design of maturation inhibitors based on BVM and IP6.",

EcDNA has been reported to display open chromatin structure, facilitate oncogene amplification and genetic material unequal segregation, and is associated with poor cancer patients prognosis. The ability of immune evasion is a typical feature for cancer progression, however the tumor intrinsic factors that determine immune evasion remain poorly understood. Here we show that the presence of ecDNA is associated with markers of tumor immune evasion, and obtaining ecDNA could be one of the mechanisms employed by tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. Tumors with ecDNA usually have comparable TMB and neoantigen load, however they have lower immune cell infiltration and lower cytotoxic T cell activity. The microenvironment of tumors with ecDNA shows increased immune desert, decreased immune enriched fibrotic types. Both MHC class I and class II antigen presentation genes expression are decreased in tumors with ecDNA, and this could be the underlying mechanism for ecDNA associated immune evasion. This study provides evidence that the presence of ecDNA is an immune escape mechanism for cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Extensive genetic and epigenetic variegation has been demonstrated in many malignancies. Importantly, their interplay has the potential to contribute to disease progression and treatment resistance. To shed light on the complex relationships between these different sources of intra-tumour heterogeneity, we explored their relative contributions to the evolutionary dynamics of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in children with Down syndrome, which has particularly poor prognosis. We quantified the tumour propagating potential of genetically distinct sub-clones using serial transplantation assays and SNP-arrays. While most leukaemias were characterized by a single dominant subclone, others were highly heterogeneous. Importantly, we provide clear and direct evidence that genotypes and phenotypes with functional relevance to leukemic progression and treatment resistance can co-segregate within the disease. Hence, individual genetic lesions can be restricted to well-defined cell immunophenotypes, corresponding to different stages of the leukemic differentiation hierarchy and varied proliferation potentials. As a result of this difference in fitness, which can be accurately quantified via competitive transplantation assays, matching diagnostic, post-treatment, and relapse leukemias can be dominated by different genotypes, including pre-leukemic clones persisting throughout the disease progression and treatment. Intriguingly, plasticity also appears to be a temporally defined property that can segregate with genotype. These results suggest that Down Syndrome ALL should be viewed as a complex matrix of cells exhibiting genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity that foster extensive clonal evolution and competition. Therapeutic intervention reshapes this  eco-system and may provide the right conditions for the preferential expansion of selected compartments and subsequently relapse.",

We added 77 newly defined and 33 revised characteristics, including features of the skull, teeth, and postcranial bones. In the present analysis, the tribe Teleoceratini, as well as the tribe Aceratheriini, was reclassified within Aceratheriinae, however, the traditionally established monophyly of each tribe was decomposed. Combined with detailed morphological comparisons, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Aceratheriinae and revised the diagnosis of Aceratheriinae. The reported skull and teeth specimens of Turkanatherium from the late Early Miocene indicate that it is not an acerathere and has been placed as a basal rhinocerotid. The Aceratheriinae has undergone evolutionary adaptation several times during the early stage of evolution, and several genera from the Oligocene to the Early Miocene have been reconstructed as early diverging taxa, such as Molassitherium, Protaceratherium, Plesiaceratherium and Chilotheridium; Aprotodon and Mesaceratherium from the Late Oligocene to the Early Miocene were united as the earliest divergent clade of Aceratheriinae; meanwhile, due to the limited materials, the phylogenies of Floridaceras and Dromoceratherium are unstable in this analysis, and both have been tentatively considered as the early diverging clades of Aceratheriinae. Alicornops was reclassified a member of Teleoceratini. Aceratheriini and Teleoceratini have been redefined as two highly specialized groups.

    "abstract": "Selective drug delivery to injured regions of the brain is an elusive, but biomedically important, goal. It is tempting to co-opt migrating white blood cells (WBC) to carry drugs to the injured brain, using natural WBC tropism. Current approaches to load cargoes to WBC have limited utility, particularly in acute conditions, due to the need for time consuming ex vivo manipulation and loading of cells. Physiological, in vivo loading of WBC may be advantageous in this scenario. Here we devised such a strategy, capitalizing on the unique features of the direct blood exchange between brain and lungs. Mediators emanating from the injured brain directly travel to the pulmonary vasculature via venous flow. In response to these mediators, WBCs, transiently residing in the pulmonary microvascular lumen, disembark and flow with arterial blood to the brain microvasculature, where they adhere and transmigrate to the brain parenchyma via the local chemoattractant gradient. We posited that direct in vivo targeting of cargoes to the pulmonary WBC pool may provide drug transfer to brain via this natural mechanism. To test this, we intravenously injected agents targeted to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM) in mice with acute brain inflammation caused by direct injection of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). We found that: A) At 2 hours, >20% of ICAM/NP accumulated in lungs, predominantly in WBCs; B) At 6 and 22 hours, ICAM/NP pulmonary uptake markedly decreased; C) In contrast, ICAM/NP uptake in brain increased ~5-fold in this time interval, concomitantly with migration of WBCs to the brain. Cranial window fluorescent microscopy confirmed WBC transport of ICAM/NP to the brain in TNF--challenged mice beyond the BBB. Importantly, demonstrating the pharmacologic relevance of this strategy, dexamethasone-loaded ICAM/liposomes abrogated brain edema in this model. In sum, coopting the natural homing of WBC from the lungs via ICAM-targeting to injured brain is an attractive strategy for precise interventions for treatment of acute brain injuries.\n\nVISUAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Saccharin-induced met-expectation of sweet taste enhances, while H2O-induced unmet-expectation deteriorates, glucose metabolism in peripheral tissues. Deletion of saccharin-responsive neurons in BLA impaired saccharin-induced increase in insulin sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Variation in the blood metabolome is intimately related to human health. Prior work has shown that host genetics and gut microbiome composition, combined, explain sizable, but orthogonal, components of the overall variance in blood metabolomic profiles. However, few details are known about the interplay between genetics and the microbiome in explaining variation on a metabolite-by-metabolite level. Here, we performed analyses of variance for each of the 945 blood metabolites that were robustly detected across a cohort of 2,049 individuals, while controlling for a number of relevant covariates, like sex, age, and genetic ancestry. Over 60% of the detected blood metabolites were significantly associated with either host genetics or the gut microbiome, with more than half of these associations driven solely by the microbiome and around 30% under hybrid genetic-microbiome control. The variances explained by genetics and the microbiome for each metabolite were indeed largely additive, although subtle, but significant, non-additivity was detected. We found that interaction effects, where a metabolitemicrobe association was specific to a particular genetic background, were quite common, albeit with modest effect sizes. The outputs of our integrated genetic-microbiome regression models provide novel biological insights into the processes governing the composition of the blood metabolome. For example, we found that unconjugated secondary bile acids were solely associated with the microbiome, while their conjugated forms were under strong host genetic control. Overall, our results reveal which components of the blood metabolome are under strong genetic control, which are more dependent on gut microbiome composition, and which are dependent upon both. This knowledge will help to guide targeted interventions designed to alter the composition of the blood metabolome.",

    "abstract": "New tools for cell signaling pathway inference from multi-omics data that are independent of previous knowledge are needed. Here we propose a new de novo method, the de novo multi-omics pathway analysis (DMPA), to model and combine omics data into regulatory complexes and pathways. DMPA was validated with publicly available omics data and was found accurate in discovering protein-protein interactions, kinase substrate phosphosite relationships, transcription factor target gene relationships, metabolic reactions, epigenetic trait associations and signaling pathways. DMPA was benchmarked against existing module and network discovery and multi-omics integration methods and outperformed previous methods in module and signaling pathway discovery especially when applied to datasets with low sample sizes and zero-inflated data. Transcription factor, kinase, subcellular location and function prediction algorithms were devised for transcriptome, phosphoproteome and interactome regulatory complexes and pathways, respectively. To apply DMPA in a biologically relevant context, interactome, phosphoproteome, transcriptome and proteome data were collected from analyses carried out using melanoma cells to address gamma-secretase cleavage-dependent signaling characteristics of the receptor tyrosine kinase TYRO3. The pathways modeled with DMPA reflected both the predicted function and the direction of the predicted function in validation experiments.",

    "abstract": "Living cells use signaling and regulatory mechanisms to adapt to environmental stresses. In the case of oxidative stress due for instance to hydrogen peroxide exposure, the adaptation response relies on co-regulation of enzymes in both glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP), so as to support PPP-dependent NADPH and redox homeostasis. To understand the regulatory logic underlying early oxidative stress response, available metabolomics and 13C fluxomics dataset are used to infer a probabilistic ensemble of kinetic models. Model ensemble properties of parameter distributions, transient dynamics, dose-response curves and loss-of-function phenotypes all highlights significant and cooperative effects of allosteric regulations of G6PD, PGI and GAPD in early oxidative response. Indeed, efficient flux rerouting into PPP is shown to require dose-dependent coordination between upregulated G6PD enzyme and increased G6P metabolite, the latter requiring fine-tuned inhibition of upper and lower glycolytic enzymes. This set of allosteric regulation also combines negative and positive feedback loops in a subtle manner prone to generate paradoxical perturbation phenotypes for instance related to 6PGD modulation.",

    "abstract": "Modeling biological mechanisms is a key for disease understanding and drug-target identification. However, formulating quantitative models in the field of Alzheimers Disease is challenged by a lack of detailed knowledge of relevant biochemical processes. Additionally, fitting differential equation systems usually requires time resolved data and the possibility to perform intervention experiments, which is difficult in neurological disorders. This work addresses these challenges by employing the recently published Variational Autoencoder Modular Bayesian Networks (VAMBN) method, which we here trained on combined clinical and patient level gene expression data while incorporating a disease focused knowledge graph. Our approach, called iVAMBN, resulted in a quantitative model that allowed us to simulate a down-expression of the putative drug target CD33, including potential impact on cognitive impairment and brain pathophysiology. Experimental validation demonstrated a high overlap of molecular mechanism predicted to be altered by CD33 perturbation with cell line data. Altogether, our modeling approach may help to select promising drug targets.\n\nAuthor SummaryFor the last 20 years the field of Alzheimers Disease (AD) is marked by a series of continuous failures to deliver demonstrably effective medications to patients. This is also highlighted by the highly controversial recent approval of Aduhelm (Biogen) by the FDA, which is now investigated internally due to the lack of clear efficacy.\n\nOne of the reasons for the continuous failure of trials in AD is the choice of the wrong target mechanism. In essence there is a lack of understanding, how targeting a certain molecule would affect cognitive impairment in human. One way to address this issue is the development of quantitative system level models connecting the molecular level with the phenotype. However, formulating such models in the field of Alzheimers Disease is challenged by a lack of detailed knowledge of relevant biochemical processes and the connection of molecular mechanisms to cognitive impairment. Additionally, fitting of differential equation systems, which are often used in systems biology, requires time resolved data and the possibility to perform intervention experiments, which is difficult in neurological disorders due to the lack of realistic model systems.\n\nOur work addresses these challenges by employing a novel hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach combining variational autoencoders with Bayesian Networks. Our proposed approach, named Integrative Variational Autoencoder Modular Bayesian Networks (iVAMBN), was trained on combined clinical and patient level gene expression data while incorporating a disease focused knowledge graph. Our method resulted in an interpretable, quantitative model. It showed connections between various biological mechanisms playing a role in AD. Furthermore, iVAMBN directly connected the molecular level to the disease phenotype. Our model allowed us to simulate a down-expression of the putative drug target CD33. Results showed a significantly increased cognition and predicted perturbation of a number of biological mechanisms. We experimentally validated these predictions using gene expression data from a knock-out THP-1 monocyte cell line. This experiment confirmed our model predictions up to a very high extend. To our knowledge we thus developed the first experimentally validated, quantitative, multi-scale model connecting molecular mechanisms with clinical outcomes in the AD field.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of Tau aggregates is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease, but little is known about where these aggregates assemble and how stable these assemblies are. Using quantitative, single-molecule imaging, we show that Tau exhibits spatial and kinetic heterogeneity near the plasma membrane, resulting in the formation of nanometer-sized hot spots smaller than the diffraction limit. The hot spots lasted tens of seconds, much longer than the short dwell time (~40 ms) of Tau on microtubules. Pharmacological and biochemical disruption of Tau/microtubule interactions did not affect hot spot formation, suggesting that these are different from the reported Tau condensation on microtubules. Although cholesterol removal has been shown to reduce Tau pathology, its depletion did not affect Tau hot spot dynamics. Our study identifies an intrinsic dynamic property of Tau near the plasma membrane that may facilitate the formation of assembly sites for Tau to assume its physiological and pathological functions.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and immunoevasion through upregulation of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) are important drivers of cancer progression. While EMT has been proposed to facilitate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression, the molecular mechanisms of their interaction remain obscure. Here we provide insight into these mechanisms by proposing a mathematical model that describes the crosstalk between EMT and Interferon gamma (IFN{gamma})-induced PD-L1 expression. Our model shows that via interaction with microRNA-200 (miR-200), the multistability of the EMT regulatory circuit is mirrored in the PD-L1 levels, which are further amplified by IFN{gamma} stimulation. This IFN{gamma}-mediated effect is most prominent for cells in a fully mesenchymal state, and less strong for those in an epithelial or partially mesenchymal state. Additionally, bi-directional crosstalk between miR-200 and PD-L1 implies that IFN{gamma} stimulation allows cells to undergo EMT for lower amounts of inducing signal, and that IFN{gamma} presence accelerates EMT and decelerates Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET). Overall, our model agrees with published findings and provides insight into possible mechanisms behind EMT-mediated immune-evasion; and primary, adaptive, or acquired resistance to immunotherapy. Our model can be used as a starting point to explore additional crosstalk mechanisms, as an improved understanding of these mechanisms is indispensable for developing better diagnostic and therapeutic options for cancer patients.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=97 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478950v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5fde0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7e929dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb9f6borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f50ad_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Schematic overview of the crosstalk between Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Interferon gamma (IFN{gamma})-induced Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.
