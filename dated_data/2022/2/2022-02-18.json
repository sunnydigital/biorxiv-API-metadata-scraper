    "abstract": "Furin cleavage-site (CS) present between the S1/S2 junction in SARS-CoV2 spike (S) protein is critical to drive the fusion of SARS-CoV2 with the host cell. SARS-CoV2 falls in the sarbecovirus lineage that doesnt comprise of furin CS and therefore makes its origin enigmatic. The available wild-type (Wt) SARS-CoV2 S protein with PDB ID: 6yvb lacks a stretch of amino acid including furin CS as well. All investigators till date have shown this stretch existing in the form of a loop. We are for the first time reporting that this stretch comprises of 14 amino acid residues (677QTNSPRRARSVASQ689), forming an antiparallel {beta}-sheet comprising of PRRAR furin CS. We observed the presence of this antiparallel {beta}-sheet in MERS spike protein as well. While switching over from Wt. SARS-CoV2 with PRRAR furin CS to B.1.1.7 variant with HRRAR furin CS, we found 3% increase in the percentage content of {beta} stands. Interestingly, we found that the change of B.1.1.7 to B.1.617 variant comprising of RRRAR furin CS shifted the percentage secondary structure back to that found in Wt. SARS-CoV2. We anticipate that this {beta}-sheet is used as a docking site by host cell proteases to act on furin-CS. Additionally, we studied the interaction of modeled SARS-CoV2 S protein with transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and furin proteases, which clearly highlighted that these proteases exclusively uses furin CS located in {beta}-sheet to cleave the SARS-CoV2 S protein at its S1/S2 junction.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) requires the development of next-generation biologics that are effective against a variety of strains of the virus. Herein, we characterize a human VH domain, F6, which we generated by sequentially panning large phage displayed VH libraries against receptor binding domains (RBDs) containing VOC mutations. Cryo-EM analyses reveal that F6 has a unique binding mode that spans a broad surface of the RBD and involves the antibody framework region. Attachment of an Fc region to a fusion of F6 and ab8, a previously characterized VH domain, resulted in a construct (F6-ab8-Fc) that neutralized Omicron pseudoviruses with a half-maximal neutralizing concentration (IC50) of 4.8 nM in vitro. Additionally, prophylactic treatment using F6-ab8-Fc reduced live Beta (B.1.351) variant viral titers in the lungs of a mouse model. Our results provide a new potential therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs - including the recently emerged Omicron variant - and highlight a vulnerable epitope within the spike protein RBD that may be exploited to achieve broad protection against circulating variants.",

    "abstract": "The merozoite surface protein MSPDBL2 of Plasmodium falciparum is under strong balancing selection and is a target of naturally acquired antibodies. Remarkably, MSPDBL2 is expressed in only a minority of mature schizonts of any cultured parasite line, and mspdbl2 gene transcription increases in response to overexpression of the gametocyte development inducer GDV1, so it is important to understand its natural expression. Here, MSPDBL2 in mature schizonts was analysed in the first ex vivo culture cycle of 96 clinical isolates from four populations with varying levels of infection endemicity in different West African countries, by immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies against a conserved region of the protein. In most isolates, less than 1% of mature schizonts were positive for MSPDBL2 (median of 0.6% overall), but the frequency distribution was highly skewed as nine isolates had more than 3% schizonts positive and one had 73% positive. To investigate whether expression of other gene loci correlated with MSPDBL2 expression, whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on schizont-enriched material from 17 of the clinical isolates with a wide range of proportions of schizonts positive. Transcripts of particular parasite genes were highly significantly positively correlated with MSPDBL2 positivity in schizonts as well as with mspdbl2 gene transcript levels, with overrepresentation of genes previously implicated as likely to be involved in gametocytogenesis, but not including the gametocytogenesis master regulator ap2g. Although MSPDBL2 is apparently not directly involved in sexual commitment, it marks a co-occurring developmental subpopulation that may be functionally distinct within blood stage infections.",

    "abstract": "Herpesviral infection reflects thousands of years of co-evolution and the constant struggle between virus and host for control of cellular gene expression. During Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication, the virus rapidly seizes control of host gene expression machinery by triggering a massive RNA decay event via a virally-encoded endoribonuclease, SOX. This virus takeover strategy decimates close to 80% of cellular transcripts, reallocating host resources toward viral replication. The host cell, however, is not entirely passive in this assault on RNA stability. A small pool of host transcripts that actively evade SOX cleavage has been identified over the years. One such \"escapee\", C19ORF66 (herein referred to as Shiftless - SHFL) encodes a potent anti-viral protein capable of restricting the replication of multiple DNA, RNA, and retroviruses including KSHV. Here, we show that SHFL restricts KSHV replication by targeting the expression of critical viral early genes, including the master transactivator protein, KSHV ORF50, and thus subsequently the entire lytic gene cascade. Consistent with previous reports, we found the SHFL interactome throughout KSHV infection is dominated by RNA-binding proteins that influence both translation and protein stability, including the viral protein ORF57, a crucial regulator of viral RNA fate. We next show that SHFL affects cytoplasmic RNA granule formation, triggering the disassembly of processing bodies. Taken together, our findings provide insights into the complex relationship between RNA stability, RNA granule formation, and the anti-viral response to KSHV infection.\n\nSignificanceIn the past five years, SHFL has emerged as a novel and integral piece of the innate immune response to viral infection. SHFL has been reported to restrict the replication of multiple viruses including several flaviviruses and the retrovirus HIV-1. However, to date, the mechanism(s) by which SHFL restricts DNA virus infection remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that following its escape from KSHV-induced RNA decay, SHFL acts as a potent anti-viral factor, restricting nearly every stage of KSHV lytic replication. In this study, we set out to determine the mechanism by which SHFL restricts KSHV infection. We demonstrate that SHFL impacts all classes of KSHV genes and found that SHFL restricts the expression of several key early genes, including KSHV ORF50 and ORF57. We then mapped the interactome of SHFL during KSHV infection and found several host and viral RNA-binding proteins that all play crucial roles in regulating RNA stability and translation. Lastly, we found that SHFL expression influences RNA granule formation both outside of and within the context of KSHV infection, highlighting its broader impact on global gene expression. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel relationship between a critical piece of the anti-viral response to KSHV infection and the regulation of RNA-protein dynamics.",

The cellular mechanisms and molecular mediators of RBC egress and invasion remain poorly characterized in Babesia spp., a group of parasites of veterinary importance and emerging cause of zoonotic disease. Through the use of video microscopy, transcriptomics, and chemical genetics we have implicated signaling, proteases and gliding motility in egress and/or invasion by Babesia divergens. We developed CRISPR/Cas9 and two inducible knockdown systems to perform a genetic screen of putative mediators of egress. We found that proteases ASP2 and ASP3 are required for invasion, and the latter is also required for egress. Strikingly, parasites continue to replicate intracellularly in the absence of the protein kinases, PKG or CDPK4, indicating that they are required for exit from the replication cycle and egress. These essential molecules present druggable targets for Babesia spp. All together we have established a molecular framework for the spread of infection through host RBCs, with egress of B. divergens more closely resembling T. gondii than the more evolutionarily related Plasmodium spp.\n\nHighlightsO_LIEgress in Babesia divergens requires host cell lysis and parasite motility\nC_LIO_LITranscriptomics can be used to identify egress and invasion proteins\nC_LIO_LIKnockdown of the proteases, ASP2 and ASP3, inhibit egress and invasion\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of PKG or CDPK4 signaling results in continued intracellular replication\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Hinokitiol (HK), a tropolone-related compound found in cupressaceous plants, has antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. But its roles in Aspergillus fumigatus ( A.F. ) keratitis remains unknown. This study examined the antifungal activity of HK against A.F. and investigated its possible mechanisms at the ultrastructural and transcriptional levels. We tested the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of HK against A.F.. Our data showed that the MIC50 was 2 g/ml and MIC90 was 8 g/ml, and HK could significantly inhibit the spore germination and mycelial growth of A.F.. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations showed that HK induced significant changes in hyphal morphology and microstructure, including cell membrane rupture and intracellular structural disorder. Adhesion assay and biofilm assay experiments showed that HK reduced the adhesion of spores to human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) and inhibited the formation of biofilms. The genetic changes of A.F. after HK treatment were analyzed by RNA sequencing, and a total of 2487 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including the down-regulated DEGs related to carbohydrate and various amino acid metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, asexual reproduction, and up-regulated DEGs related to steroid biosynthesis through GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. RNA-seq results suggested that HK may play an antifungal effect by destroying the structural integrity of its wall and membrane, inhibiting protein biosynthesis and the growth and reproduction of A.F..10 g/ml HK, which had no effect on proliferation and migration of HCECs, was used in the treatment of murine fungal keratitis (FK). We found that HK eyedrop treatment could reduce the severity of FK by reducing corneal fungal burden, neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of LOX-1 and pro-inflammatory factors. HK is expected to be a safe and effective new drug for FK treatment.\n\nAuthor summaryFK is a serious common blind-causing eye disease. The current clinical antifungal drugs have the disadvantages of low bioavailability and high corneal toxicity, which greatly limit the clinical effectiveness. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a new, safe and effective treatment for FK. HK had shown great antifungal capacity against A.F., amazingly well anti-inflammatory effect and real improvement in murine FK in our research. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of HK as an antifungal drug and reveal the potential of HK to be applied in the clinical treatment of FK.",

    "abstract": "Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent bacterium causing tularemia zoonosis. An increasing proportion of infections occur through contaminated hydro-telluric sources, especially for the subspecies holarctica (Fth). Although this bacterium has been detected in several aquatic environments, the mechanisms of its long-term persistence in water are not yet elucidated. We evaluated the culturability and the viability of a virulent Fth strain in independent microcosms filled with nutrient-poor water. At 37{degrees}C, the bacteria remained culturable for only one week, while culturability was extended to 6 weeks at 18{degrees}C and up to 11 weeks at 4{degrees}C. However, while the viability of the bacteria declined similarly to culturability at 37{degrees}C, the viability of the bacteria remained stable overtime at 18{degrees}C and 4{degrees}C for more than 24 months, long after loss of culturability. We identified water temperature as one of the major factors driving the aquatic survival of Fth through a transition of the whole Fth population in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. Low temperature of water ([&le;]18{degrees}C) favors the persistence of the bacteria in a VBNC state, while a temperature above 30{degrees}C kills culturable and VBNC Fth bacteria. These findings provide new insights into the environmental cycle of Francisella tularensis that suggest that the yet unidentified primary reservoir of the subspecies holarctica may be the aquatic environment itself in which the bacteria could persist for months or years without the need for a host.",

    "abstract": "The calcite platelets of coccolithophores (Haptophyta), the coccoliths, are among the most elaborate biomineral structures. How these unicellular algae accomplish the complex morphogenesis of coccoliths is still largely unknown. It has long been proposed that the cytoskeleton plays a central role in shaping the growing coccoliths. Previous studies have indicated that disruption of the microtubule network led to defects in coccolith morphogenesis in Emiliania huxleyi and Coccolithus braarudii. Disruption of the actin network also led to defects in coccolith morphology in E. huxleyi, but its impact on coccolith morphology in C. braarudii was less clear, as coccolith secretion was largely inhibited under the conditions used. A more detailed examination of the role of actin and microtubule networks is therefore required to address the wider role of the cytoskeleton in coccolith morphogenesis. In this study, we have examined coccolith morphology in C. braarudii and Scyphosphaera apsteinii following treatment with the microtubule inhibitors vinblastine and colchicine (S. apsteinii only) and the actin inhibitor cytochalasin B. We found that all cytoskeleton inhibitors induced coccolith malformations, strongly suggesting that both microtubules and actin filaments are instrumental in morphogenesis. By demonstrating the requirement for the microtubule and actin networks in coccolith morphogenesis in diverse species, our results suggest that both of these cytoskeletal elements are likely to play conserved roles in defining coccolith morphology.",

While the Inc CpoS was recently revealed as a critical suppressor of host cellular immune surveillance, the underlying mechanism remained unknown. By complementing a cpoS mutant with modified variants of CpoS, we found that CpoS blocks distinct cellular defense responses through distinct mechanisms. Specifically, we show that the ability of CpoS to interact with Rab GTPases is not only instrumental to its ability to mediate lipid transport to the inclusion, but also key to CpoS-mediated inhibition of type I interferon responses. Indeed, depletion of Rab35 can phenocopy the respective defect of the cpoS mutant. Unexpectedly, we found that CpoS is also essential for the formation of inclusion microdomains that control the spatial organization of multiple Incs involved in signaling and modulation of the host cellular cytoskeleton. Overall, our findings highlight the modulation of membrane trafficking as a pathogenic immune evasion strategy and the role of Inc-Inc interactions in shaping the inclusion microenvironment.",

Long mRNAs are enriched in stress granules, which is thought to reflect the ability of long mRNAs to form multiple RNA-RNA interactions with other mRNAs. RNA-RNA interactions are thus thought to be critical for stress granule formation. Stress granule-enriched mRNAs also often contain multiple N6-methyladenosine (m6A) residues. YTHDF proteins bind m6A, creating mRNA-protein complexes that partition into stress granules. Here we determine the basis of length-dependent enrichment of mRNAs in stress granules. We show that depletion of m6A is sufficient to abrogate the length-dependent enrichment of mRNAs in stress granules. We show that the presence of m6A predicts which mRNAs are enriched. m6A formation is triggered by long exons, which are often found in long mRNAs, accounting for the link between m6A, length and stress granule enrichment. Thus, length-dependent enrichment of mRNAs in stress granules is driven by YTHDF-mRNA interactions.",

    "abstract": "The ribosomal DNA array in Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of many tandem repeats whose copy number is believed to be functionally important but highly labile. Regulatory mechanisms have evolved to maintain copy number by directed mutation, but how spontaneous variation at this locus is generated and selected has not been well characterized. We applied a mutation accumulation approach to quantify the impacts of mutation and selection on this unique genomic feature across hundreds of mutant strains. We find that mutational variance for this trait is relatively high, and that un-selected mutations throughout the genome can disrupt copy number maintenance. In consequence, copy number generally declines, consistent with a model of regulation where copy number is normally increased when low. This pattern holds across ploidy levels and strains in the standard lab environment, but differs under some stressful conditions. We identify several alleles, gene categories and genomic features that likely affect copy number, including aneuploidy for chromosome XII. Copy number change is associated with reduced growth in diploids, consistent with stabilizing selection. Levels of standing variation in copy number are well predicted by a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection, suggesting this trait is not subject to strong diversifying selection in the wild. The rate and spectrum of point mutations within the rDNA locus itself is distinct from the rest of the genome, and predictive of polymorphism locations. Our findings help differentiate the roles of mutation and selection and indicate that spontaneous mutation patterns shape several aspects of ribosomal DNA evolution.",

Compared to the plain model that contained all five facets of assumptions, the model variations often fit the data better and generated predictions that largely differed from the predictions of the plain model. The statistic Roystons R2 measured a models goodness of fit, and thereby determined if the model was an enhancement upon the plain model. For 15 of the 26 model variations Roystons R2 was greater than that of the plain model for >50% of diseases. Reclassification rates, defined as the fraction of individuals in the top five percentiles of the plain models predictions who are not in the top five percentiles of a model variations predictions, was used to determine if the variation led to significantly different predictions. For 20 of the 26 model variations the median reclassification rate calculated across the 18 diseases was greater than 10%. Comparisons of accuracy statistics further illustrated how much each model variations predictions differed from the plain models predictions.\n\nModels containing polygenic risk scores appear to be significantly affected by many common modelling assumptions. Therefore, future investigations should consider taking some action to mitigate modelling assumptions.\n\nAuthor SummaryAn individuals genetics can increase their risk of experiencing a disease. The exact magnitude of the increased risk is estimated within a statistical model. The traditional model type employed in this process is relatively plain and contains several assumptions. The predicted risk estimates from this plain model may be unnecessarily inaccurate. To test this possibility, we searched the literature for model variations that reduce the assumptions of the plain model, ultimately creating 26 distinct model variations that may improve upon the plain model. Each model variation was fit with data from the UK Biobank to predict 18 diseases. We found that 15 of the 26 models variations fit the data better than the plain model for a majority of diseases. Goodness of fit was measured with Roystons R2 statistic. Further calculations found that the predictions of the model variations were often significantly more or less accurate than the predictions of the plain model. We believe these results indicate that future investigations of polygenic risk scores should not employ the plain model, as unreliable risk predictions will likely result.",

    "abstract": "Human DJ-1 is a cytoprotective protein whose absence causes Parkinsons disease and is also associated with other diseases. DJ-1 has an established role as a redox-regulated protein that defends against oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Multiple studies have suggested that DJ-1 is also a protein/nucleic acid deglycase that plays a key role in the repair of glycation damage caused by methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive -keto aldehyde formed by central metabolism. Contradictory reports suggest that DJ-1 is a glyoxalase but not a deglycase and does not play a major role in glycation defense. Resolving this issue is important for understanding how DJ-1 protects cells against insults that can cause disease. We find that DJ-1 reduces levels of reversible adducts of MG with guanine and cysteine in vitro. The steady-state kinetics of DJ-1 acting on reversible hemithioacetal substrates are fitted adequately with a computational kinetic model that requires only a DJ-1 glyoxalase activity, supporting the conclusion that deglycation is an apparent rather than a true activity of DJ-1. Sensitive and quantitative isotope-dilution mass spectrometry shows that DJ-1 modestly reduces the levels of some irreversible guanine and lysine glycation products in primary and cultured neuronal cell lines and whole mouse brain, consistent with a small but measurable effect on total neuronal glycation burden. However, DJ-1 does not improve cultured cell viability in exogenous MG. In total, our results suggest that DJ-1 is not a deglycase and has only a minor role in protecting neurons against methylglyoxal toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Identifying new binding sites and poses that modify biological function are an important step towards drug discovery. We have identified a novel disulphide constrained peptide that interacts with the cap-binding site of eIF4E, an attractive therapeutic target that is commonly overexpressed in many cancers and plays a significant role in initiating a cancer specific protein synthesis program though binding the 5cap (7methyl-guanoisine) moiety found on mammalian mRNAs. The use of disulphide constrained peptides to explore intracellular biological targets is limited by their lack of cell permeability and the instability of the disulphide bond in the reducing environment of the cell, loss of which results in abrogation of binding. To overcome these challenges, the cap-binding site interaction motif was placed in a hypervariable loop on an VH domain, and then selections performed to select a molecule that could recapitulate the interaction of the peptide with the target of interest in a process termed Peptide Epitope Linker Evolution (PELE). A novel VH domain was identified that interacted with the eIF4E cap binding site with a nanomolar affinity and that could be intracellularly expressed in mammalian cells. Additionally, it was demonstrated to specifically modulate eIF4E function by decreasing cap-dependent translation and cyclin D1 expression, common effects of eIF4F complex disruption.",

    "abstract": "Recently developed chemical and enzyme-based technologies to install serine ADP-ribosylation onto synthetic peptides have enabled new approaches to study PARP biology. Here, we establish a generalizable strategy to prepare ADP-ribosylated peptides that are compatible with N-terminal, C-terminal and sequential protein ligation reactions. Two unique protein-assembly routes are employed to generate full-length linker histone constructs that are homogenously ADP-ribosylated at known DNA damage-dependent modification sites. We found that serine mono-ADP-ribosylation is sufficient to alleviate linker histone-dependent chromatin compaction, and that this effect is amplified by ADP-ribose chain elongation. Our work will greatly expand the scope of ADP-ribose-modified proteins that can be constructed via semisynthesis, which is rapidly emerging as a robust approach to elucidate the direct effects that site-specific serine mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylation have on protein function.",

    "abstract": "Carboxysomes are proteaceous bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) that sequester the key enzymes for carbon fixation in cyanobacteria and some proteobacteria. They consist of a virus-like icosahedral shell, encapsulating carbonic anhydrase and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), which catalyses the dehydration of bicarbonate into CO2, the first step of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Despite their significance in carbon fixation and great bioengineering potentials, the structural characterization of native carboxysomes, including the shell and the internal organization, is currently limited to low-resolution tomography studies. Notably, the degree of heterogeneity of the shell, and the internal arrangement of enzymes, remain poorly understood. Here, we report the structural characterization of a native -carboxysome from a marine cyanobacterium by single-particle cryo-EM. We determine the structure of RuBisCO enzyme at 2.9 [A] resolution. In addition, we obtain low-resolution maps of the icosahedral protein shell and the concentric interior organisation. In combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven modelling approaches, we exploited these maps to propose a complete atomic model of an intact carboxysome. This study provides insight into carboxysome structure and protein-protein interactions involved in carboxysome assembly. Advanced knowledge about carboxysome architecture and structural plasticity is critical for not only a better understanding of biological carbon fixation mechanism but also repurposing carboxysomes in synthetic biology for biotechnological applications.",

However, we previously reported that eosinophils accumulate in lung lesions during type-I inflammatory responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in humans, macaques, and mice where they contribute to host resistance. Here we show eosinophils migrate into the lungs of macaques and mice as early as one week after Mtb-exposure. In mice this influx was CCR3 independent and instead required cell-intrinsic expression of the oxysterol-receptor GPR183, which is highly expressed on human and macaque eosinophils. Murine eosinophils interacted directly with bacilli-laden alveolar macrophages, which upregulated the oxysterol-synthesizing enzyme Ch25h, and eosinophil recruitment was impaired in Ch25h deficient mice.

    "abstract": "Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato late blight, is a devastating plant disease that leads to Irish potato famine and threatens world-wide food security. Despite the genome of P. infestans has provided fundamental resource for studying the aggressiveness of this pandemic pathogen, the epigenomes remain poorly understood. Here, utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we demonstrate post-translational modifications (PTM) at P. infestans core histone H3. The PTMs not only include these prevalent modifications in eukaryotes, and also some novel marks, such as H3K53me2 and H3K122me3. We focused on the trimethylations of H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27 and H3K36, and profiled P. infestans epigenomes employing Native Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (N-ChIP-seq). In parallel, we mapped P. infestans chromomatin accessibility by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq). We found that adaptive genomic compartments display significantly higher levels of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, and are generally in condense chromatin. Interestingly, we observed that genes encoding virulence factors, such as effectors, are enriched in open chromatin regions that barely have the four histone modifications. With a combination of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic strategies, our study illustrates the epigenetic states in P. infestans, which will help to study genomic functions and regulations in this pathogen.\n\nAuthor summaryEpigenetics play an important role in various biological processes of eukaryotes, including pathogenicity of plant pathogens. However, the epigenetic landscapes are marginally known in oomycetes that are fungal-like organisms and comprise lots of destructive plant pathogens. In this study, using the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans as a model, we conducted genome-wide studies of histone post modifications and chromatin accessibility, and demonstrate the relationship of gene expression and evolution with the epigenetic marks. We found that one of the most important classes of virulence proteins, effectors, are enriched in open chromatin regions that barely have eu- and hetero-chromatic marks. This study provides an overview of the oomycete epigenetic atlas, and advances our understanding of the regulation of virulence factors in plant pathogens.",

The molecular mechanisms of paraspeckle formation have been mainly studied using human or mouse cells, and it is not known if the same molecular components are involved in the formation of paraspeckles in other mammalian species. We thus investigated the expression pattern of NEAT1_2 in naked mole-rats (nNEAT1_2), which exhibit extreme longevity and lower susceptibility to cancer. In the intestine, nNEAT1_2 is widely expressed along the entire intestinal epithelium, which is different from the expression of mNeat1_2, that is restricted to the cells of the distal tip in mice. Notably, the expression of FUS, a FET family RNA binding protein, essential for the formation of paraspeckles both in humans and mice, was absent in the distal part of the intestinal epithelium in naked mole-rats. Instead, mRNAs of other FET family proteins EWSR1 and TAF15 were expressed in the distal region. Exogenous expression of these proteins in Fus-deficient murine embryonic fibroblast cells rescued the formation of paraspeckles. These observations suggest that nNEAT1_2 recruits different set of RNA binding proteins in a cell type-specific manner during the formation of paraspeckles in different organisms.",

Here we examine ancestry, population structure and inbreeding using SNP microarray genotypes in a cohort of 814 wild mice spanning five continents and all major subspecies of Mus, with a focus on M. m. domesticus. We find that the major axis of genetic variation in M. m. domesticus is a south-to-north gradient within Europe and the Mediterranean. The dominant ancestry component in North America, Australia, New Zealand and various small offshore islands is of northern European origin. Next we show that inbreeding is surprisingly pervasive and highly variable, even between nearby populations. By inspecting the length distribution of homozygous segments in individual genomes, we find that inbreeding in commensal populations is mostly due to consanguinity.

    "abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited peripheral polyneuropathy in humans, and its different subtypes are linked to mutations in dozens of different genes. Mutations in ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) cause two types of CMT, demyelinating CMT4A and axonal CMT2K. The GDAP1-linked CMT genotypes are mainly missense point mutations. Despite clinical profiling and in vivo studies on the mutations, the etiology of GDAP1-linked CMT is poorly understood. Here, we describe the biochemical and structural properties of the Finnish founding CMT2K mutation H123R as well as CMT2K-linked R120W, both of which are autosomal dominant mutations. The disease variant proteins retain close to normal structure and solution behaviour, but both present a large decrease in thermal stability. Using GDAP1 variant crystal structures, we identify a side chain interaction network between helices 3, 6, and 7, which is affected by CMT mutations, as well as a hinge in the long helix 6, which is linked to structural flexibility. Structural analysis of GDAP1 indicates that CMT may arise from disruption of specific intra- and intermolecular interaction networks, leading to alterations in GDAP1 structure and stability, and eventually, insufficient motor and sensory neuron function.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils is the archetype of aberrant biomolecular self-assembly processes, with more than 50 diseases associated that are mostly uncurable. Understanding aggregation mechanisms is thus of fundamental importance and goes in parallel with the characterization of the structures of the transient oligomers formed in the process. Oligomers have been proven elusive to high-resolution structural techniques, while the large sizes and long-time scales typical of aggregation processes have limited, so far, the use of computational methods. To surmount these limitations, we introduce here multi-eGO, an atomistic, hybrid structure-based model, which leveraging on the knowledge of monomers conformational dynamics and of fibril structures, can efficiently capture the essential structural and kinetics aspects of protein aggregation. Multi-eGO molecular dynamics simulations can describe the aggregation kinetics of thousands of monomers. The concentration dependence of the simulated kinetics, as well as the structural features of the resulting fibrils, are in qualitative agreement with in vitro experiments on an amyloidogenic peptide of Transthyretin, a protein responsible for one of the most common cardiac amyloidosis. Multi-eGO simulations allow to observe in time and at atomic resolution the formation of primary nuclei in a sea of transient lower order oligomers, to follow their growth and the subsequent secondary nucleation events, till the maturation of multiple fibrils. Multi-eGO, combined with the many experimental techniques deployed to study protein aggregation, can provide the structural basis needed to advance the design of molecules targeting amyloidogenic diseases.\n\nSignificance StatementAlzheimers and Parkinsons diseases are uncurable pathologies associated to the aberrant aggregation of specific proteins into amyloid fibrils. Understanding the mechanism leading to protein aggregation, by characterizing the structures of the oligomeric species populated in the process, would have a tremendous impact on the design of therapeutic molecules. We propose that a structure-based approach to molecular dynamics simulations can allow following at high resolution the aggregation kinetics of thousands of monomers. Having shown that simulations can describe the aggregation of a Transthyretin amyloidogenic peptide, we demonstrate how their efficiency allows acquiring a wealth of structural information. We foresee that integrating the latter with the many techniques developed to study protein aggregation will support the design of molecules to modulate amyloidogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) uses a combination of activity-based chemical probes with mass spectrometry (MS) to selectively characterise a particular enzyme or enzyme class. ABPP has proven invaluable for profiling enzymatic inhibitors in drug discovery. When applied to cell extracts and cells, challenging the ABP-enzyme complex formation with a small molecule can simultaneously inform on potency, selectivity, reversibility/binding affinity, permeability, and stability. ABPP can also be applied to pharmacodynamic studies to inform on cellular target engagement within specific organs when applied to in vivo models. Recently, we established separate high depth and high throughput ABPP (ABPP-HT) protocols for the profiling of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs). However, the combination of the two, deep and fast, in one method has been elusive. To further increase the sensitivity of the current ABPP-HT workflow we implemented state-of-the-art data-independent acquisition (DIA) and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS analysis tools. Hereby, we describe an improved methodology, ABPP-HT* (enhanced high-throughput-compatible activity-based protein profiling), that in combination with DIA MS methods allowed for the consistent profiling of 35-40 DUBs and provided a reduced number of missing values, whilst maintaining a throughput of 100 samples per day.",

    "abstract": "The promise of precision medicine has been limited by the pervasive therapeutic resistance to many targeted therapies for cancer. Inferring the timing (i.e., pre-existing or acquired) and mechanism (i.e., drug-induced) of such resistance is crucial for designing effective new therapeutics. This paper studies the mechanism and timing of cetuximab resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using tumor volume data obtained from patient-derived tumor xenografts. We propose a family of mathematical models, with each member of the family assuming a different timing and mechanism of resistance. We present a method for fitting these models to individual volumetric data, and utilize model selection and parameter sensitivity analyses to ask: which member of the family of models best describes HNSCC response to cetuximab, and what does that tell us about the timing and mechanisms driving resistance? We find that along with time-course volumetric data to a single dose of cetuximab, the initial resistance fraction and, in some instances, dose escalation volumetric data are required to distinguish among the family of models and thereby infer the mechanisms of resistance. These findings can inform future experimental design so that we can best leverage the synergy of wet laboratory experimentation and mathematical modeling in the study of novel targeted cancer therapeutics.",

To investigate the gut microbiome composition in CDI patients, we analysed 534 metagenomes from 10 publicly available CDI study populations. We then tracked C. difficile on a global scale, screening 42,900 metagenomes from 253 public studies. Among the CDI cohorts, we detected C. difficile in only 30% of the stool samples from CDI patients. However, we found that multiple other toxigenic species capable of inducing CDI-like symptomatology were prevalent. In addition, the majority of the investigated studies did not adhere to the recommended guidelines for a correct CDI diagnosis.\n\nIn the global survey, we found that C. difficile prevalence, abundance and biotic context were age-dependent. C. difficile is a rare taxon associated with reduced diversity in healthy adults, but common and associated with increased diversity in infants. We identified a group of species co-occurring with C. difficile exclusively in healthy infants, enriched in obligate anaerobes and in species typical of the healthy adult gut microbiome. C. difficile in healthy infants was therefore associated with multiple indicators of healthy gut microbiome maturation.\n\nOur analysis raises concerns about potential CDI overdiagnosis and suggests that C. difficile is an important commensal in infants and that its asymptomatic carriage in adults depends on microbial context.",

Here we explore a metabolite-triggered circuit between epithelial tuft cells and innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2) that is evolutionarily optimized for intestinal remodeling in response to helminth infection. We demonstrate that tuft cell-derived interleukin 25 (IL25) acts as an alarmin on ILC2s to induce the release of IL13 as a growth factor for tuft cells, and propose that this model drives early metaplastic remodeling and gastric tumor formation. Genetic ablation of tuft cells, ILC2s or antibody-mediated neutralization of IL13 or IL25 reduces the growth of established tumors. Thus, the tuft cell/ILC2 axis provides an opportunity to therapeutically inhibit preneoplastic lesions and early-stage gastric cancer through repurposing of antibody-mediated therapies.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTuft cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells offer a new therapeutic target in gastric disease.",

    "abstract": "Body size variation is an enigma. We do not understand why species achieve the sizes they do, and this means we also do not understand the circumstances under which gigantism or dwarfism is selected. We develop size-structured integral projection models to explore evolution of body size and life history speed. We make few assumptions and keep models simple: all functions remain constant across models except for the one that describes development of body size with age. We set sexual maturity to occur when size attains 80% of the asymptotic size, which is typical of a large mammal, and allow negative density dependence to only affect either reproduction or juvenile survival. Fitness - the quantity that is maximized by adaptive evolution - is carrying capacity in our models, and we are consequently interested in how it changes with size at sexual maturity, and how this association varies with development rate. The simple models generate complex dynamics while providing insight into the circumstances when extremes of body size evolve. The direction of selection leading to either gigantism or dwarfism crucially depends on the proportion of the population that is sexually mature, which in turn depends on how the development function determines the survivorship schedule. The developmental trajectories consequently interact with size-specific survival or reproductive rates to determine the best life history and the optimal body size emerges from that interaction. These dynamics result in trade-offs between different components of the life history, with the form of the trade-off that emerges depending upon where in the life history density dependence operates most strongly. Empirical application of the approach we develop has potential to help explain the enigma of body size variation across the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "The toxicity of non-proteinogenic amino acids has been known for decades. Numerous reports describe their antimicrobial/anticancer potential. However, these molecules are often toxic to the host as well, therefore a synthetic lethality approach can be beneficial. Here we investigated the potential synthetic lethality between toxic amino acids, the retrograde pathway, and molecular chaperones. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mitochondrial retrograde (RTG) pathway activation induces transcription of RTG-target genes, which replenishes alpha- ketoglutarate and glutamate; both metabolites are required for arginine and lysine biosynthesis. We previously reported that tolerance of canavanine, a toxic arginine derivative, requires an intact RTG pathway, and low-dose canavanine exposure reduces the expression of RTG-target genes. At higher concentrations, canavanine causes protein misfolding. Here we show that in WT, low-dose thialysine exposure, a toxic lysine analog, has a similar effect as canavanine on RTG-target gene expression. To study if single amino acid deficiency and mild protein misfolding stress elicit a similar effect on RTG-target genes, we compared expression of heat shock protein (HSP) mutants grown without arginine or lysine to WT. Arginine deprivation induces RTG-target gene expression in sse2{Delta}, hsp78{Delta}, and mdj1{Delta}, but CIT2 and DLD3 are reduced in cpr7{Delta}. Lysine deprivation has the opposite effect on RTG-target gene expression in HSP mutants. Interestingly, exposure of HSP mutants to canavanine and thialysine reversed the trend of RTG-target gene expression in several cases. The RTG-target expression pattern in HSP mutants had a predictive value in canavanine sensitivity - the mutant with the lowest expression was the most sensitive - but this was not the case for thialysine. Some, but not all, mutants in RTG-target genes are sensitive to canavanine and thialysine; additional mutation in a certain HSP can exacerbate this sensitivity. Overall, we show that inhibiting molecular chaperones, RTG-target genes, or both can sensitize cells to low doses of toxic amino acids.",

    "abstract": "Human peripheral neuropathies are poorly-understood, and the availability of experimental models limits further research. The PeriTox test uses immature dorsal root ganglia (DRG)-like neurons, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), to assess cell death and neurite damage. Here, we explored the suitability of matured peripheral neuron cultures for detection of sub-cytotoxic endpoints, such as altered responses of pain-related P2X receptors. A 2-step differentiation protocol, involving transient expression of ectopic neurogenin-1 (NGN1), allowed for the generation of homogeneous cultures of sensory neurons. After > 38 days-of-differentiation, they showed a robust response (Ca2+-signalling) to the P2X3 ligand ,{beta}-methylene ATP. The clinical proteasome inhibitor bortezomib abolished the P2X3 signal at [&ge;] 5 nM, while 50-200 nM were required in the PeriTox test to identify neurite damage and cell death. A 24 h treatment with low nM concentrations of bortezomib led to moderate increases in resting cell intracellular [Ca2+], but signalling through transient receptor potential-V1 (TRPV1) receptors or depolarization-triggered Ca2+-influx remained unaffected. We interpret the specific attenuation of purinergic signalling as functional cell stress response. A reorganization of tubulin to dense structures around the cell somata confirmed a mild, non-cytotoxic stress triggered by low concentrations of bortezomib. The proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib, delanzomib, epoxomycin and MG-132 showed similar stress responses. Thus, the model presented here may be used for profiling of new proteasome inhibitors as to their side effect (neuropathy) potential, or for pharmacological studies on the attenuation of their neurotoxicity. P2X3 signalling proved useful as endpoint to assess potential neurotoxicants in peripheral neurons.",

    "abstract": "Working memories have long been thought to be maintained by persistent spiking. However, mounting evidence from multiple-electrode recording (and single-trial analyses) shows that the underlying spiking is better characterized by intermittent bursts of activity. A counterargument suggested this intermittent activity is at odds with observations that spike-time variability reduces during task performance. However, this counterargument rests on assumptions, such as randomness in the timing of the bursts, that may not be correct. Thus, we analyzed spiking and LFPs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys to determine if task-related reductions in variability can co-exist with intermittent spiking. We found that it does because both spiking and associated gamma bursts were task-modulated, not random. In fact, the task-related reduction in spike variability could be explained by a related reduction in gamma burst variability. Our results provide further support for the intermittent activity models of working memory as well as novel mechanistic insights into how spike variability is reduced during cognitive tasks.",

Here, we disambiguate the role of experience and development in neural sequence formation by delaying exposure to a tutor. Using functional calcium imaging, we observe neural sequences in the absence of tutoring, demonstrating that experience is not necessary for the formation of sequences. However, after exposure to a tutor, pre-existing sequences can become tightly associated with new song syllables. Since we delayed tutoring, only half our birds learned new syllables following tutor exposure.

    "abstract": "Prefrontal cortical influence over the mesolimbic system - including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) - is implicated in various cognitive processes and behavioral malfunctions. The functional versatility of this system could be explained by an underlying anatomical complexity; however, the detailed characterization of the medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) innervation of the NAc and VTA is still lacking. Therefore, combining classical retrograde and conditional viral tracing techniques with multiple fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we sought to deliver a precise, cell- and layer-specific anatomical description of the cortico-mesolimbic pathways. We demonstrated that NAc- (mPFCNAc) and VTA-projecting mPFC (mPFCVTA) populations show different laminar distribution (layers 2/3-5a and 5b-6, respectively) and express different molecular markers. Specifically, calbindin and Ntsr1 are specific to mPFCNAc neurons, while mPFCVTA neurons express high levels of Ctip2 and FoxP2, indicating that these populations are mostly separated at the cellular level. We directly tested this with double retrograde tracing and Canine adenovirus type 2-mediated viral labelling and found that there is indeed minimal overlap between the two populations. Furthermore, whole-brain analysis revealed that the projection patter of these populations is also different throughout the brain. Taken together, we demonstrated that the NAc and the VTA are innervated by two, mostly non-overlapping mPFC populations with different laminar distribution and molecular profile. These results can contribute to the advancement in our understanding of mesocorticolimbic functions and its disorders in future studies.",
