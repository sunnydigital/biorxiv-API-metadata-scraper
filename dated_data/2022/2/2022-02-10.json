    "abstract": "Environmental chemicals are commonly studied one at a time, and there is a need to advance our understanding of the effect of exposure to their combinations. Here we apply high-content microscopy imaging of cells stained with multiplexed dyes (Cell Painting) to profile the effects of Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), Bisphenol A (BPA), and Dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) exposure on four human cell lines; both individually and in all combinations. We show that morphological features can be used with multivariate data analysis to discern between exposures from individual compounds, concentrations, and combinations. CTAB and DBTDL induced concentration-dependent morphological changes across the four cell lines, and BPA exacerbated morphological effects when combined with CTAB and DBTDL. Combined exposure to CTAB and BPA induced changes on the ER, Golgi apparatus, nucleoli and cytoplasmic RNA in one of the cell lines. Different responses between cell lines indicate that multiple cell types are needed when assessing combination effects. The rapid and relatively low-cost experiments combined with high information content makes Cell Painting an attractive methodology for future studies of combination effects. All data in the study is made publicly available on Figshare.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAssessment of combination effects of BPA, CTAB and DBTDL on four human cell lines\nC_LIO_LIMorphological profiling/Cell Painting captures dose and combination dependent effects\nC_LIO_LIBPA exacerbated morphological effects when combined with CTAB and DBTDL.\nC_LIO_LICell models of diverse origin are needed when profiling environmental chemicals\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Gi/o protein-coupled receptors (Gi/o-GPCRs) limit pancreatic islet insulin secretion by decreasing {beta}-cell Ca2+ entry, which is essential for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. However, the Gi/o-GPCR signaling mechanism that mediates inhibition of human islet hormone secretion has not been identified. Here we demonstrate that Gi/o-GPCRs cause hyperpolarization of the {beta}-cell membrane potential through activation of Na+/K+ ATPases (NKAs) in mouse and human islets. Stimulation of Gi/o-coupled somatostatin or 2-adrenergic receptors induced oscillations in {beta}-cell NKA activity, which resulted in islet Ca2+ fluctuations. Selective induction of {beta}-cell Gi/o signaling with a chemogenetic Gi/o-GPCR also activated NKAs and initiated islet Ca2+ oscillations, suggesting that {beta}-cell Gi/o-GPCRs tune pulsatile insulin secretion. Furthermore, intra-islet paracrine activation of {beta}-cell Gi/o-GPCR signaling and NKAs by {delta}-cell somatostatin secretion slowed Ca2+ oscillations, which decreased insulin secretion. Gi/o-GPCR-mediated oscillations in {beta}-cell membrane potential and Ca2+ were dependent on NKA phosphorylation by Src tyrosine kinases; an effect that was mimicked by stimulating islet insulin receptor tyrosine kinases. Whereas {beta}-cell NKA function was completely inhibited by cAMP-dependent PKA activation. Taken together, these data reveal that NKA-mediated hyperpolarization of {beta}-cell membrane potential serves as the primary and conserved mechanism for Gi/o-GPCR control of electrical excitability, Ca2+ handling, and insulin secretion.",

The present study focused on the contribution of environmental constituents to population dynamics via a high-throughput assay and data-driven analysis of a wild-type Escherichia coli strain. A large dataset constituting a total of 12,828 bacterial growth curves with 966 medium combinations, which were composed of 44 pure chemical compounds, was acquired. Machine learning analysis of the big data relating the growth parameters to the medium combinations revealed that the decision-making components for bacterial growth were distinct among various growth phases, e.g., glucose, sulfate and serine for maximum growth, growth rate and growth delay, respectively. Further analyses and simulations indicated that branched-chain amino acids functioned as global coordinators for population dynamics, as well as, a survival strategy of risk diversification to prevent the bacterial population from undergoing extinction.",

    "abstract": "Cell motility has important influence on cell interactions and functionality for various biological aspects. Deciphering these dynamics often relies on live-cell microscopy measurements, which partly have to deal with limitations that could impair a reliable quantification of their motility. Especially given complex environments and tissue structures, limited observation periods, cells moving in and out of focus and impaired calibration of observation axes often lead to loss of cell tracks and insufficient tracking of motility within several dimensions. However, a reliable quantification of cell motility dynamics is essential when aiming at extrapolating the observed dynamics in order to understand cell population dynamics at larger temporal and spatial scales using appropriate simulation environments.\n\nTo analyze how incomplete observations affect interpretation and parameterization of cell motility, we combined experimental observations with computational models. Studying individual cell dynamics within 3D collagen environments, we found that the gradual loss of cell tracks leads to an underestimation of several motility parameters with the effect dependent on the collagen density. By extending the automated fitting strategy FitMultiCell to account for cell track loss, we show that we are able to retrieve the actual cell dynamics and, thus, to reliably parameterize cell motility from such incomplete data. Applying our approach to the analysis of CD4+ T cells within 3D collagen environments that were infected with HIV-1, we could show that despite a considerable loss of cell tracks, the data still contained sufficient information to compare individual cell motilities by inferring and simulating their dynamics. Thereby, the analysis allowed us to disentangle the effect of HIV-1 infection and collagen density on individual cell motility. Our extended FitMultiCell-approach presented here provides a solution for the elimination of artifacts from cell track data analysis to robustly infer cell motility dynamics.",

    "abstract": "More than a dozen excitatory cell types have been identified in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) based on transcriptomic, morphological and in vitro electrophysiological features. However, the functional landscape of excitatory neurons with respect to their responses to visual stimuli is currently unknown. Here, we combined large-scale two-photon imaging and deep learning neural predictive models to study the functional organization of mouse V1 using digital twins. Digital twins enable exhaustive in silico functional characterization providing a bar code summarizing the input-output function of each neuron. Clustering the bar codes revealed a continuum of function with around 30 modes. Each mode represented a group of neurons that exhibited a specific combination of stimulus selectivity and nonlinear response properties such as cross-orientation inhibition, size-contrast tuning and surround suppression. These non-linear properties were expressed independently spanning all possible combinations across the population. This combinatorial code provides the first large-scale, data-driven characterization of the functional organization of V1. This powerful approach based on digital twins is applicable to other brain areas and to complex non-linear systems beyond the brain.",

Thirty-two individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis performed a grasp-and-lift task while muscle activities were measured using eight surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors. Subjects performed the task with their affected hand before and after exposure to the sensory stimulation elicited by performing the task with the less-affected hand. For the first time, this work shows that InfoMuNet robustly quantifies functional muscle connectivity improvements in the affected hand after exposure of the less-affected side to sensory information. >90% of the subjects conformed with the improvement resulting from this sensory exposure. InfoMuNet also shows high sensitivity to tactile, kinesthetic, and visual input alterations at the subject level, highlighting the potential use in precision rehabilitation interventions.",

Herein, we present lyophilized SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines, which can be stored at room temperature with long-term thermostability. In the in vivo Delta virus challenge experiment, lyophilized Delta variant mRNA vaccine successfully protected mice from infection and cleared the virus. Lyophilized omicron mRNA vaccine enabled to elicit both potent humoral and cellular immunity. In booster immunization experiments in mice and old monkeys, lyophilized omicron mRNA vaccine could effectively increase the titers of neutralizing antibodies against wild-type coronavirus and omicron variants. In humans, lyophilized omicron mRNA vaccine as a booster shot could also engender excellent immunity and had less severe adverse events. This lyophilization platform overcomes the instability of mRNA vaccines without affecting their bioactivity, and significantly improved their accessibility, particularly in remote regions.",

Robust systemic inflammation may trigger persistent changes in hematopoietic cells and innate immune memory through epigenetic mechanisms. We reveal that rare circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), enriched from human blood, match the diversity of HSPC in bone marrow, enabling investigation of hematopoiesis and HSPC epigenomics. Following COVID-19, HSPC retain epigenomic alterations that are conveyed, through differentiation, to progeny innate immune cells. Epigenomic changes vary with disease severity, persist for months to a year, and are associated with increased myeloid cell differentiation and inflammatory or antiviral programs.

    "abstract": "Recurrent waves of SARS CoV2 infections remain a major global health concern. Emergence of highly infectious variants with reduced sensitivity to neutralization by vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) necessitates a deeper understanding of factors involved in SARS CoV2 infections and identification of drug candidates to halt infection. Here, we determined the primacy of endosomal protease cathepsin-L in mediating SARS CoV2 entry and screened a library of well-annotated bioactive compounds for potent cathepsin-L inhibitory activity. Whilst the potent cathepsin-L inhibitors were capable of inhibiting SARS CoV2 entry and cytopathic effect (CPE) in less susceptible cell lines such as human ACE2 expressing 293T cells, these drugs failed to inhibit SARS CoV2 in highly susceptible cell lines such as human TMPRSS2 or human-ACE2-TMPRSS2 overexpressing Vero E6 cells. Only drugs with dual inhibitory effect on both host cathepsin-L and virus 3CL-Protease enzymes such as Z-FA-FMK and GC-376 were capable of inhibiting prototypic (USA-WA1/2020, Lineage A) SARS CoV2 induced CPE in highly susceptible cell lines. Moreover, these drugs inhibited delta (Lineage-B.1.617.2) and omicron (Lineage-B.1.1.529) infection with equal potency showing that the newer mutations harbored in these variants did not affect the mechanism of action of these drugs such as cathepsin-L or 3CL-Pro inhibition. Moreover, our early evidence that 3CL-Pro inhibition can effectively inhibit omicron-induced CPE in highly susceptible cell lines suggests that the recently FDA-approved oral drug, a 3CL-Pro inhibitor which is a combination of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) could be effective against omicron variant which shows reduced sensitivity to vaccines and mAb.\n\nImportanceWe report that cathepsin-L and 3CL-Pro as major targets for designing antivirals against SARS CoV2. Dual inhibition of cathepsin-L and 3CL-Pro by GC-376 renders it effective in inhibiting SARS CoV2-induced cytopathic effect in highly susceptible cell lines. Moreover, this candidate drug is equally effective against prototypic SARS CoV2 lineage A and emerging variants such as delta and omicron which show reduced sensitivity to vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. Given the recent wave of SARS CoV2 omicron variant infection around the world, and 3CL-Pro inhibitor nirmatrelvir is one of the components of the FDA-approved Paxlovid, our findings are timely, important and should be of broad interest.",

SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or interest (VOC/VOI) have evidence of increased viral transmission, disease severity, or decreased effectiveness of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Remdesivir (RDV, VEKLURY(R)) is a nucleoside analog prodrug and the first FDA-approved antiviral treatment of COVID-19. Here we present a comprehensive antiviral activity assessment of RDV and its parent nucleoside, GS-441524, against 10 current and former SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOI clinical isolates by nucleoprotein ELISA and plaque reduction assay.\n\nDelta and Omicron variants remained susceptible to RDV and GS-441524, with EC50 values 0.31 to 0.62-fold of those observed against the ancestral WA1 isolate. All other tested variants exhibited EC50 values ranging from 0.15 to 2.3-fold of the observed EC50 values against WA1. Analysis of nearly 6 million publicly available variant isolate sequences confirmed that Nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) target of RDV and GS-441524, is highly conserved across variants with only 2 prevalent changes (P323L and G671S). Using recombinant viruses, both RDV and GS-441524 retained potency against all viruses containing frequent variant substitutions or their combination. Taken together, these results highlight the conserved nature of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 and provide evidence of sustained SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of RDV and GS-441524 across the tested variants. The observed pan-variant activity of RDV supports its continued use for the treatment of COVID-19 regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 variant.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnopheles gambiae densovirus (AgDNV) is an insect-specific, single-stranded DNA virus that infects An. gambiae, the major mosquito species responsible for transmitting malaria parasites throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. AgDNV is a benign virus that is very specific to its mosquito host and therefore has potential to serve as a vector control tool via paratransgenesis (genetic modification of mosquito symbionts) to limit transmission of human pathogens. Prior to being engineered into a control tool, the natural transmission dynamics of AgDNV between An. gambiae mosquitoes needs to be fully understood. Additionally, improved knowledge of AgDNV infection in male mosquitoes is needed. In this study, we examine the tissue tropism of AgDNV in the male reproductive tract and investigate both venereal and vertical transmission dynamics of the virus.\n\nMethodsAn. gambiae adult males were infected with AgDNV via micro-injection and reproductive tissues collected and assayed for AgDNV using qPCR. Next, uninfected females were introduced to AgDNV-infected or control males and, after several nights of mating, both the spermatheca and female carcass were assessed for venereally transmitted AgDNV. Finally, F1s from this cross were collected and assayed to quantify vertical transmission of the virus.\n\nResultsAgDNV infected the reproductive tract of male mosquitoes, including the testes and male accessory glands (MAGs), without affecting mating rates. AgDNV-infected males venereally transmitted virus to females, and these venereally-infected females developed disseminated infection throughout the body. However, AgDNV was not vertically transmitted to F1s resulting from this cross.\n\nConclusionsInfected male releases could be an effective strategy to introduce AgDNV-based paratransgenic tools into naive populations of An. gambiae females.",

    "abstract": "In the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) inhibits the innate immune response by inserting its C-terminal helices into the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome and promoting mRNA degradation. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which Nsp1 achieves host translational shutoff while allowing for viral protein synthesis remains elusive. We set out to characterize the interactome of full-length Nsp1 and its topology by crosslinking mass spectrometry in order to investigate the role of the N-terminal domain and linker regions in host translational shutoff. We find that these regions are in contact with 40S proteins lining the mRNA entry channel and detect a novel interaction with the G subunit of the eIF3 complex. The crosslink-derived distance restraints allowed us to derive an integrative model of full-length Nsp1 on the 40S subunit, reporting on the dynamic interface between Nsp1, the ribosome and the eIF3 complex. The significance of the Nsp1-eIF3G interaction is supported by further evidence that Nsp1 predominantly binds to 40-43S complexes. Our results point towards a mechanism by which Nsp1 is preferentially recruited to canonical initiation complexes, leading to subsequent mRNA degradation.",

    "abstract": "In late December of 2019, high throughput sequencing technologies enabled rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the etiological agent of COVID-19, and global sequencing efforts are now a critical tool for monitoring the ongoing spread and evolution of this virus. Here, we analyze a subset (n=83,204) of all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n=~5.6 million) that were randomly selected, but equally distributed over the course of the pandemic. We plot the emergence and extinction of new variants of concern (VOCs) over time and show how this corresponds to the ongoing accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and individual proteins. While the accumulation of mutations generally follows a linear regression, non-synonymous mutations are significantly greater in Omicron viruses than in previous variants-especially in the spike and nucleoproteins-and these differences are more pronounced in a recently identified sub-lineage (BA.2) of Omicron.\n\nImportanceOmicron is the fifth SARS-CoV-2 variant to be designated a Variant of Concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Here we provide a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and explain how the Omicron variant is distinct. Our work shows that the spike and nucleoproteins have accumulated the most mutations in Omicron variants, but that the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 sequences are changing most rapidly relative to their size. Collectively, this \"Observation\" provides a concise overview of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, reveals mutational differences between two Omicron lineages, and highlights changes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that have been under reported.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid technologies with designed delivery systems have surged as one the most promising therapies of the future, due to their contribution in combating SARS-CoV-2 severe disease. Nevertheless, the emergence of new variants of concern still represents a real threat in the years to come. It is here that the use of small interfering RNA sequences to inhibit gene expression and, thus, protein synthesis, may complement the already developed vaccines, with faster design and production. Here, we have designed new sequences targeting COVID-19 variants and other related viral diseases through bioinformatics, while also addressing the limited number of delivery peptides by a deep learning approach. Two sequences databases were produced, from which 62 were able to target the virus mRNA, and ten displayed properties present in delivery peptides, which we compared to the broad use TAT delivery peptide.",

    "abstract": "First-generation vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been administered to more than 60% of the population in developed countries. However, the monovalent vaccines currently available in Europe do not confer adequate and durable immune protection. To satisfy the need for a novel vaccine, we engineered a divalent gene construct consisting of the receptor binding domain (RBD, 300-685 aa) of the spike protein and the immunodominant region of the nucleocapsid (100-300 aa). This fusion protein was cloned into a pET-30a plasmid and expressed either in Escherichia coli or in a recombinant baculovirus in insect cells. Following purification via its His-tag, the fusion protein was mixed with adjuvant, and administered to mice in a prime-booster-mode. Upon testing for IgG antibody response against nucleocapsid and RBD, a titer of 10-4 - 10-5 was demonstrated 14 days after the first booster injection in 72% of the animals, which could be increased to 100% by a second booster. Notably, comparable IgG responses were detected against the delta, gamma and omicron variants of the RBD region. Durability testing revealed the presence of IgG beyond 90 days. In addition, granzyme A and perforin mRNA expression (cytolytic effector cell molecules) was increased in cytotoxic lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. Ex vivo stimulation of T-cells by nucleocapsid and RBD peptides showed antigen-specific upregulation of CD44 in vaccinated mice among their CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. No side-effect was documented in the central nervous system, be it either endothelial inflammation or neuronal damage. Cumulatively, the combined induction of B-cell and T-cell response by a bivalent protein-based vaccine directed against two structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins represents a proof-of-principle approach alternative to existing mRNA vaccination strategies, which could confer long-lasting immunity against all known viral strains.",
