    "abstract": "Enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (ECRs) belong to the most efficient CO2-fixing enzymes described to date. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ECRs extraordinary catalytic activity on the level of the protein assembly remain elusive. Here we used a combination of ambient temperature X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) and cryogenic synchrotron experiments to study the structural organization of the ECR from Kitasatospora setae. K. setae ECR is a homo-tetramer that differentiates into a dimer of dimers of open- and closed-form subunits in the catalytically active state. Using molecular dynamics simulations and structure-based mutagenesis, we show that catalysis is synchronized in K. setae ECR across the pair of two dimers. This conformational coupling of catalytic domains is conferred by individual amino acids to achieve high CO2-fixation rates. Our results provide unprecedented insights into the dynamic organization and synchronized inter- and intra-subunit communications of this remarkably efficient CO2-fixing enzyme during catalysis.\n\nSignificance StatementFixation of CO2 offers real potential for reaching negative CO2 emissions in bioenergy, and bioproduct utilization. The capture and conversion of atmospheric CO2 remains a challenging task. Existing biological systems can be exploited and optimized for this use. Bacterial enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (ECRs) encompass the fastest CO2-fixing enzymes found in nature to date. However, the mechanisms underlying ECRs extraordinary catalytic activity remain elusive. Our structural, computational, and biochemical results elucidate the dynamic structural organization of the ECR complex and describe how coupled motions of catalytic domains in the ECR tetramer drive carboxylation. This mechanistic understanding is critical for engineering highly efficient CO2-fixing biocatalysts for bioenergy and bioproduct applications.",

    "abstract": "The development of in vivo imaging and optogenetic tools makes it possible to control neural circuit activities in an all-optical, closed-loop manner [1], but such applications are limited by the lack of software for online analysis of neuronal imaging data. We developed an analysis software ORCA (Online Real-time activity and offline Cross-session Analysis), which performs image registration, neuron segmentation, and activity extraction at over 100 frames per second, fast enough to support real-time detection and readout of neural activity. Our active neuron detection algorithm is purely statistical, achieving much higher speed than previous methods. We demonstrated closed-loop control of neurons that were identified on the fly, without prior recording or image processing. ORCA also includes a cross-session alignment module that efficiently tracks neurons across multiple sessions. In summary, ORCA is a powerful toolbox for fast imaging data analysis, and provides a solution for all-optical closed-loop control of neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by immune exclusion, pro-inflammatory polarization of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). We have previously demonstrated that reciprocally activated RAS/MEK/ERK and JAK/STAT3 pathways mediate therapeutic resistance, while combined MEK and STAT3 inhibition (MEKi+STAT3i) overcomes such resistance in preclinical models. We now show that combined MEKi+STAT3i not only alters stromal architecture but also uncovers stromal plasticity by revealing a substantial attenuation of Il6/Cxcl1-expressing secretory and Lrrc15-expressing myofibroblastic CAF phenotypes with a concomitant enrichment of Ly6a/Cd34-expressing CAF phenotypes exhibiting mesenchymal progenitor-like properties via single-cell RNA sequencing in Ptf1acre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Tgfbr2flox/flox(PKT) mice. This remodeling of CAF heterogeneity is associated with reprogramming of immunosuppressive myeloid populations and enhanced trafficking of CD8+ T-cells which exhibit a distinct effector transcriptional program. These MEKi+STAT3i-mediated repercussions are in part CAF-dependent, since CRISPR/Cas9 genetic silencing of CAF-restricted Mek1/Stat3 mitigates inflammatory CAF polarization and myeloid infiltration in vivo. Addition of MEKi+STAT3i to PD-1 blockade overcomes ICI resistance by significantly augmenting anti-tumor responses and dramatically improving survival in PKT mice compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The addition of MEKi+STAT3i to PD-1 blockade not only augments the recruitment of activated and memory T-cell populations, but also improves their degranulating capacity and functional cytotoxicity compared to PD-1 blockade alone. Importantly, treatment of a patient with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic PDAC with MEKi (Trametinib), STAT3i (Ruxolitinib), and PD-1 inhibitor (Nivolumab) was well-tolerated and yielded clinical benefit. These data uncover a novel paradigm in which combined MEKi+STAT3i reprograms stromal inflammation and immune tolerance to overcome immunotherapy resistance in PDAC.",

First, we present an overview of possible misspecifications that come with GWAS summary statistics. Then, in both simulations and real data analyses, we show that additional information such as imputation INFO scores, allele frequencies, and per-variant sample sizes in GWAS summary statistics can be used to detect possible issues and correct for misspecifications in the GWAS summary statistics. One important motivation for us is to improve the predictive performance of polygenic scores built from these summary statistics. Unfortunately, due to the lack of reporting standards for GWAS summary statistics, this additional information is not systematically reported. We also show that using well-matched LD references can improve model fit and translate into more accurate prediction. Finally, we discuss how to make polygenic score methods such as lassosum and LDpred2 more robust to these misspecifications to improve their predictive power.",

    "abstract": "The moons monthly cycle synchronizes reproduction in countless marine organisms. The mass-spawning bristle worm Platynereis dumerilii uses an endogenous monthly oscillator to phase reproduction to specific days. Classical work showed that this oscillator is set by full moon. But how do organisms recognize such a specific moon phase? We uncover that the light receptor L-Cryptochrome (L-Cry) is able to discriminate between different moonlight durations, as well as between sun- and moonlight. Consistent with L-Crys function as light valence interpreter, its genetic loss leads to a faster re-entrainment under artificially strong nocturnal light. This suggests that L-Cry blocks \"wrong\" light from impacting on the monthly oscillator. A biochemical characterization of purified L-Cry protein, exposed to naturalistic sun- or moonlight, reveals the formation of distinct sun- and moonlight states characterized by different photoreduction- and recovery kinetics of L-Crys co-factor Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide. In vivo, L-Crys sun-versus moonlight states correlate with distinct sub-cellular localizations, indicating different signalling. In contrast, r-Opsin1, the most abundant ocular opsin, is not required for monthly oscillator entrainment. Our work reveals a new concept for correct moonlight interpretation involving a \"valence interpreter\" that provides entraining photoreceptor(s) with light source and moon phase information. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of a fundamental biological phenomenon: moon-controlled monthly timing. Such level of understanding is also an essential prerequisite to tackle anthropogenic threats on marine ecology.",

    "abstract": "The genetic diversity of viral populations is a key driver of the spatial and temporal diffusion of viruses; yet, studying the diversity of whole genomes from natural populations still remains a challenge. Phylodynamic approaches are commonly used for RNA viruses harboring small genomes, but have only rarely been applied to DNA viruses with larger genomes. Here, we used the Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS, a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in the three main French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and an innovative combination of bioinformatics tools, we de novo assembled 21 OsHV-1 new genomes. Combining quantification of major and minor genetic variations, phylogenetic analysis and ancestral state reconstruction of discrete traits approaches; we assessed the connectivity of OsHV-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. Our results suggest that the Marennes- Oleron Bay represents the main source of OsHV-1 diversity, from where the virus has dispersed to other farming areas, a scenario consistent with current practices of oyster transfers in France. We demonstrate that phylodynamic approaches can be applied to aquatic DNA viruses to determine how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape their diversity patterns.\n\nImportancePhylogeography is a field of research that attempts to reconstruct the relationships between individual genotypes within a species and then correlate these genealogical relationships with their geographic and temporal origin. This field of research has become an essential step in the understanding of pandemics, in particular to determine the origin, spread and evolution of a pathogen as currently illustrated in studies on viral pandemics. However, because phylogeographic analyses are based on genome variation, stable genomes yield less information than labile genomes. Accordingly, viruses with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes generally have lower nucleotide diversity than RNA viruses. In this study, by combining the use of both major and minor genetic variations with phylogeographic analyses of the oyster herpesvirus OsHV-1, we highlight genealogical relationships that are not depicted in phylogenetic trees based on consensus viral genomes only. These data offer a plausible scenario reflecting the origin and spread of OsHV-1 populations between oyster- farming sites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe epigenetic age can now be extrapolated from one of several epigenetic clocks, which are based on age-related changes in DNA methylation levels at specific multiple CpG sites. Accelerated aging, calculated from the discrepancy between the chronological age and the epigenetic age, has shown to predict morbidity and mortality rate. We assumed that deconvolution of epigenetic age to its components could shed light on the diversity of epigenetic, and by inference, on inter-individual variability in the causes of biological aging.\n\nResultsUsing the Horvath original epigenetic clock, we identified several CpG sites linked to distinct genes that quantitatively explain much of the interpersonal variability in epigenetic aging, with CpG sites related to secretagogin and malin being the most variable. We show that equal epigenetic age in different subjects can result from variable contribution size of the same CpG sites to the total epigenetic age. In a healthy cohort, the most variable CpG sites are responsible for accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging, relative to chronological age.\n\nConclusionsOf the 353 CpG sites that form the basis for the Horvath epigenetic age, we have found the CpG sites that are responsible for accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging in healthy subjects. However, the relative contribution of each site to aging varies between individuals, leading to variable personal aging patterns. Our findings pave the way to form personalized aging cards allowing the identification of specific genes related to CpG sites, as aging markers, and perhaps treatment of these targets in order to hinder undesirable age drifting.",

    "abstract": "Embodied cognition suggests that our bodily experiences broadly shape our cognitive capabilities. We study how embodied experience affects the abstract physical problem-solving strategies people use in a virtual task where embodiment does not affect action capabilities. We compare how groups with different embodied experience - 25 children and 35 adults with congenital limb differences versus 45 children and 40 adults born with two hands - perform this task, and find that while there is no difference in overall competence, the groups use different cognitive strategies to find solutions. People born with limb differences think more before acting, but take fewer attempts to reach solutions. Conversely, development affects the particular actions children use, as well as their persistence with their current strategy. Our findings suggest that while development alters action choices and persistence, differences in embodied experience drive strategic changes in the acquisition of cognitive strategies for balancing acting with thinking.\n\nStatement of RelevanceTheories of embodied cognition suggest our cognitive and perceptual capabilities are shaped by how our bodies constrain our interactions with the world; however, these tasks often study short-term effects or setups where body differences impact task solutions. Here we compare the performance of children and adults with and without congenital limb differences (missing hands/upper limbs) on a virtual physical problem-solving task, where both groups had equal motor capabilities for interacting with the world. Across ages, participants with limb differences solved these tasks as proficiently as those without limb differences, but took fewer attempts to come to solutions, with more time spent thinking between attempts. This suggests that early life differences in embodied experience cause changes in individuals \"cognitive strategies\" for allocating time between thinking and acting.",

    "abstract": "Integrative mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as transposons and insertion sequences, propagate within bacterial genomes, but persistence times in individual lineages are short. For long-term survival, MGEs must continuously invade new hosts by horizontal transfer. Theoretically, MGEs that persist for millions of years in single lineages, and are thus subject to vertical inheritance, should not exist. Here we draw attention to an exception -- a class of MGE termed REPIN. REPINs are non-autonomous MGEs whose duplication depends on non-jumping RAYT transposases. Comparisons of REPINs and typical MGEs show that replication rates of REPINs are orders of magnitude lower, REPIN population size fluctuations correlate with changes in available genome space, REPIN conservation depends on RAYT function, and REPIN diversity accumulates within host lineages. These data lead to the hypothesis that REPINs form enduring, beneficial associations with eubacterial chromosomes. Given replicative nesting, our hypothesis predicts conflicts arising from the diverging effects of selection acting simultaneously on REPINs and host genomes. Evidence in support comes from patterns of REPIN abundance and diversity in two distantly related bacterial species. Together this bolsters the conclusion that REPINs are the genetic counterpart of mutualistic endosymbiotic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Prediction errors guide many forms of learning, providing teaching signals that help us improve our performance. Implicit motor adaptation, for instance, is driven by sensory prediction errors (SPEs), which occur when the expected and observed consequences of a movement differ. Traditionally, SPE computation is thought to require movement execution. However, recent work suggesting that the brain generates and accounts for sensory predictions based on motor imagery or planning alone calls this assumption into question. Here, by measuring implicit adaptation during a visuomotor task, we tested whether motor planning and well-timed sensory feedback are sufficient for SPE computation. Human participants were cued to reach to a target and were, on a subset of trials, rapidly cued to withhold these movements. Errors displayed both on trials with and without movements induced single-trial implicit learning. Learning following trials without movements persisted even when movement trials had never been paired with errors, and when the direction of movement and sensory feedback trajectories were decoupled. These observations demonstrate that the brain can compute SPEs without generating overt movements, leading to the adaptation of planned movements even when they are not performed.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe are always learning from our mistakes, because the brain is constantly generating predictions and monitoring the world for any surprises, which are also referred to as \"prediction errors.\" Whenever a prediction error occurs, the brain learns to update future predictions and be more accurate. Here, we demonstrate that the brain predicts the consequences of movements, computes prediction errors, and updates future movements, even if we subsequently decide to withhold the movement. Thus, the brain can learn to update movements that are not performed, representing a mechanism for learning based only on movement planning and sensory expectation. These findings also provide further support for the role of prediction in motor control.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTOur brains control aspects of our movement without our conscious awareness - allowing many of us to effortlessly pick up a glass of water or wave \"hello.\" Here, we demonstrate that this implicit motor system can learn to refine movements that we plan but ultimately decide not to perform. Participants planned to reach to a target, and they sometimes withheld these reaches. When reaches were withheld, an animation simulating a reach that missed the target played. Afterwards, participants reached opposite the direction of the mistake without awareness of this change in their movements, indicating that the implicit motor system had learned from the animated mistake. These findings indicate that movement is not strictly necessary for motor adaptation, and that we can learn to update our actions based only on movement planning and observation of related events in the world.",

    "abstract": "Sweetener type can influence sensory properties and consumers acceptance and preference for low-calorie products. An ideal sweetener does not exist, and each sweetener must be used in situations to which it is best suited. Aspartame and sucralose can be good substitutes for sucrose in passion fruit juice. Despite the interest in artificial sweeteners, little is known about how artificial sweeteners are processed in the human brain. Here, we evaluated brain signals of 11 healthy subjects when they tasted passion fruit juice equivalently sweetened with sucrose (9.4 g/100 g), sucralose (0.01593 g/100 g), or aspartame (0.05477 g/100 g). Electroencephalograms were recorded for two sites in the gustatory cortex (i.e., C3 and C4). Data with artifacts were disregarded, and the artifact-free data were used to feed a CNN. Our results indicated that the brain responses distinguish juice sweetened with different sweeteners with an average accuracy of 0.823.\n\nPractical ApplicationsFinding sweeteners that best fit consumer preferences evolves understanding how the gustatory cortex processes sweeteners. Ideal equivalence will occur when the brain is no longer able to distinguish stimuli that are consciously perceived. This study presents a method of signal acquisition using a single channel and an open-source processing environment. This would allow, for example, to disregard the use of a commercial electroencephalograph and expand the studies in this area and offering to food industry additional tools in the development of products sweetened with non-caloric sweeteners.",

    "abstract": "Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a key enzyme responsible for the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium into the amino acid glutamine. The genes encoding GS are among the oldest existing genes in living organisms. In plants, two groups of functional GS enzymes are found: eubacterial GSIIb (GLN2) and eukaryotic GSIIe (GLN1/GS). Phylogenetic analyses have shown that the GLN2 group originated from bacteria following horizontal gene transfer. Only GLN1/GS genes are found in vascular plants, which suggests that they are involved in the final adaptation of plants to terrestrial life. The present phylogenetic study reclassifies the different GS of seed plants into three clusters: GS1a, GS1b and GS2. The presence of genes encoding GS2 has been expanded to Cycadopsida gymnosperms, which suggests the origin of this gene in a common ancestor of Cycadopsida, Ginkgoopsida and angiosperms. GS1a genes have been identified in all gymnosperms, basal angiosperms and some Magnoliidae species. Previous studies in conifers and the gene expression profiles obtained in ginkgo and magnolia in the present work could explain the absence of GS1a in more recent angiosperm species (e.g., monocots and eudicots) due to the redundant roles of GS1a and GS2 in photosynthetic cells. Altogether, the results provide a better understanding of the evolution of plant GS isoenzymes and their physiological roles, which is valuable for improving crop nitrogen use efficiency and productivity.",

We developed methodology to robustly identify this state from transcriptomic signals and characterised its prevalence and genomic constraints in solid primary tumours. We show that G0 arrest preferentially emerges in the context of more stable, less mutated genomes which maintain TP53 integrity and lack the hallmarks of DNA damage repair deficiency, while presenting increased APOBEC mutagenesis. We employ machine learning to uncover novel genomic dependencies of this process and validate the role of the centrosomal gene CEP89 as a modulator of proliferation/G0 arrest capacity. Lastly, we demonstrate that G0 arrest underlies unfavourable responses to various therapies exploiting cell cycle, kinase signalling and epigenetic mechanisms in single cell data, and propose a G0 arrest transcriptional signature that is linked with therapeutic resistance and can be used to further study and clinically track this state.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of hundreds of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, the number of computational tools to analyse aspects of the generated data has grown rapidly. As a result, there is a recurring need to demonstrate whether newly developed methods are truly performant - on their own as well as in comparison to existing tools. Benchmark studies aim to consolidate the space of available methods for a given task, and often use simulated data that provide a ground truth for evaluations. Thus, demanding a high quality standard for synthetically generated data is critical to make simulation study results credible and transferable to real data.\n\nHere, we evaluated methods for synthetic scRNA-seq data generation in their ability to mimic experimental data. Besides comparing gene- and cell-level quality control summaries in both one- and two-dimensional settings, we further quantified these at the batch- and cluster-level. Secondly, we investigate the effect of simulators on clustering and batch correction method comparisons, and, thirdly, which and to what extent quality control summaries can capture reference-simulation similarity.\n\nOur results suggest that most simulators are unable to accommodate complex designs without introducing artificial effects; they yield over-optimistic performance of integration, and potentially unreliable ranking of clustering methods; and, it is generally unknown which summaries are important to ensure effective simulation-based method comparisons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe plastid genomes of the green algal order Chlamydomonadales tend to expand their non-coding regions, but this phenomenon is poorly understood. Here we shed new light on organellar genome evolution in Chlamydomonadales by studying a previously unknown non-photosynthetic lineage. We established cultures of two new Polytoma-like flagellates, defined their basic characteristics and phylogenetic position, and obtained complete organellar genome sequences and a transcriptome assembly for one of them.\n\nResultsWe discovered a novel deeply diverged chlamydomonadalean lineage that has no close photosynthetic relatives and represents an independent case of photosynthesis loss. To accommodate these organisms we establish the new genus Leontynka, with two species (L. pallida and L. elongata) distinguishable through both their morphological and molecular characteristics. Notable features of the colourless plastid of L. pallida deduced from the plastid genome (plastome) sequence and transcriptome assembly include the retention of ATP synthase, thylakoid-associated proteins, the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, and a plastoquinone-based electron transport chain, the latter two modules having an obvious functional link to the eyespot present in Leontynka. Most strikingly, the ~362 kbp plastome of L. pallida is by far the largest among the non-photosynthetic eukaryotes investigated to date due to an extreme proliferation of sequence repeats. These repeats are also present in coding sequences, with one repeat type found in the exons of 11 out of 34 protein-coding genes, with up to 36 copies per gene, thus affecting the encoded proteins. The mitochondrial genome of L. pallida is likewise exceptionally large, with its >104 kbp surpassed only by the mitogenome of Haematococcus lacustris among all members of Chlamydomonadales hitherto studied. It is also bloated with repeats, though entirely different from those in the L. pallida plastome, which contrasts with the situation in H. lacustris where both the organellar genomes have accumulated related repeats. Furthermore, the L. pallida mitogenome exhibits an extremely high GC content in both coding and non-coding regions and, strikingly, a high number of predicted G-quadruplexes.\n\nConclusionsWith its unprecedented combination of plastid and mitochondrial genome characteristics, Leontynka pushes the frontiers of organellar genome diversity and is an interesting model for studying organellar genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in experimental and computational protein structure determination have provided access to high-quality structures for most human proteins and mutants thereof. However, linking changes in structure in protein mutants to functional impact remains an active area of method development. If successful, such methods can ultimately assist physicians in taking appropriate treatment decisions. This work presents three artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive models that classify four key functional parameters of KCNQ1 variants as normal or dysfunctional using PSSM-based evolutionary and/or biophysical descriptors. Recent advances in predicting protein structure and variant properties with artificial intelligence (AI) rely heavily on the availability of evolutionary features and thus fail to directly assess the biophysical underpinnings of a change in structure and/or function. The central goal of this work was to develop an ANN model based on structure and physiochemical properties of KCNQ1 potassium channels that performs comparably or better than algorithms using only on PSSM-based evolutionary features. These biophysical features highlight the structure-function relationships that govern protein stability, function, and regulation. The input sensitivity algorithm incorporates the roles of hydrophobicity, polarizability, and functional densities on key functional parameters of the KCNQ1 channel. Inclusion of the biophysical features outperforms exclusive use of PSSM-based evolutionary features in predicting activation voltage dependence and deactivation time. As AI is increasing applied to problems in biology, biophysical understanding will be critical with respect to  explainable AI, i.e., understanding the relation of sequence, structure, and function of proteins. Our model is available at www.kcnq1predict.org.\n\nAuthor summaryHeartbeat is maintained by electrical impulses generated by ion-conducting channel proteins in the heart such as the KCNQ1 potassium channel. Pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 can lead to channel loss-of-function and predisposition to fatal life-threatening irregularities of heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Machine learning methods that can predict the outcome of a mutation on KCNQ1 structure and function would be of great value in helping to assess the risk of a heart rhythm disorder. Recently, machine learning has made great progress in predicting the structures of proteins from their sequences. However, there are limited studies that link the effect of a mutation and change in protein structure with its function. This work presents the development of neural network models designed to predict mutation-induced changes in KCNQ1 functional parameters such as peak current density and voltage dependence of activation. We compare the predictive ability of features extracted from sequence, structure, and physicochemical properties of KCNQ1. Moreover, input sensitivity analysis connects biophysical features with specific functional parameters that provides insight into underlying molecular mechanisms for KCNQ1 channels. The best performing neural network model is publicly available as a webserver, called Q1VarPredBio, that delivers predictions about the functional phenotype of KCNQ1 variants.",

    "abstract": "Naive CD4 and CD8 T cells are cornerstones of adaptive immunity, but the dynamics of their establishment early in life and how their kinetics change as they mature following release from the thymus are poorly understood. Further, due to the diverse signals implicated in naive T cell survival, it has been a long-held and conceptually attractive view that they are sustained by active homeostatic control as thymic activity wanes. Here we employ multiple experimental systems to identify a unified model of naive CD4 and CD8 T cell population dynamics across the mouse lifespan. We infer that both subsets divide rarely and progressively increase their survival capacity with cell age. Strikingly, this simple model captures naive CD4 T cell dynamics throughout life. In contrast, we find that newly generated naive CD8 T cells are lost more rapidly during the first 3-4 weeks of life, likely due to increased recruitment into memory. We find no evidence for elevated division rates in neonates, or for feedback regulation of naive T cell numbers at any age. We show how confronting mathematical models with diverse datasets can reveal a quantitative and remarkably simple picture of naive T cell dynamics from birth into old age.",

    "abstract": "Inherited microorganisms can selfishly manipulate host reproduction to drive through populations. In Drosophila melanogaster, germline expression of the native Wolbachia prophage WO proteins CifA and CifB cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in which embryos from infected males and uninfected females suffer catastrophic mitotic defects and lethality; however, in infected females, CifA expression rescues the embryonic lethality and thus imparts a fitness advantage to the maternally-transmitted Wolbachia. Despite widespread relevance to sex determination, evolution, and vector control, the mechanisms underlying when and how CI impairs male reproduction remain unknown and a topic of debate. Here we use cytochemical, microscopic, and transgenic assays in D. melanogaster to demonstrate that CifA and CifB proteins of wMel localize to nuclear DNA throughout the process of spermatogenesis. Cif proteins cause abnormal histone retention in elongating spermatids and protamine deficiency in mature sperms that travel to the female reproductive tract with Cif proteins. Notably, protamine gene knockouts enhance wild type CI. In ovaries, CifA localizes to germ cell nuclei and cytoplasm of early-stage egg chambers, however Cifs are absent in late-stage oocytes and subsequently in fertilized embryos. Finally, CI and rescue are contingent upon a newly annotated CifA bipartite nuclear localization sequence. Together, our results strongly support the Host Modification model of CI in which Cifs initially modify the paternal and maternal gametes to bestow CI-defining embryonic lethality and rescue.",

Opioids such as morphine have decreased analgesic potency (but not efficacy) in aged rodents compared to adults; however, the neural mechanisms underlying this attenuated response are not yet known. The present study investigated the impact of advanced age and biological sex on opioid signaling in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in the presence of chronic inflammatory pain. Assays measuring mu-opioid receptor (MOR) radioligand binding, GTP{gamma}S binding, receptor phosphorylation, cAMP inhibition, and regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein expression were performed on vlPAG tissue from adult (2-3mos) and aged (16-18mos) male and female rats. Persistent inflammatory pain was induced by intraplantar injection of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA). Adult males exhibited the highest MOR binding potential and the highest G-protein activation (activation efficiency ratio) in comparison to aged males and females (adult and aged). No impact of advanced age or sex on MOR phosphorylation state was observed. DAMGO-induced cAMP inhibition was highest in the vlPAG of adult males compared to aged males and females (adult and aged). vlPAG levels of RGS4 and RGS9-2, critical for terminating G-protein signaling, were assessed using RNAscope. Adult rats (both males and females) exhibited lower levels of vlPAG RGS4 and RGS9-2 mRNA expression compared to aged males and females. The observed age-related reductions in vlPAG MOR binding potential, G-protein activation efficiency, and cAMP inhibition, along with the observed age-related increases in RGS4 and RGS9-2 vlPAG expression, provide potential mechanisms whereby the potency of opioids is decreased in the aged population. These results have significant implications for pain management in this population.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAged males and females (adult and aged) exhibit reduced vlPAG -opioid receptor binding potential compared to adult males.\nC_LIO_LIAged males and females (adult and aged) exhibit reduced opioid-induced vlPAG G-protein activation compared to adult males.\nC_LIO_LIAged males and females (adult and aged) exhibit reduced vlPAG MOR mediated cAMP inhibition compared to adult males.\nC_LIO_LIAged rats (males and females) exhibit increased vlPAG mRNA expression of Regulator of G-Protein Signaling (RGS) proteins RGS4 and RGS9-2 compared to adult rats (males and females), which may explain the reduced receptor signaling observed in aged animals.\nC_LIO_LIThese coordinate decreases in opioid receptor signaling may explain the previously reported reduced potency of opioids to produce pain relief in females and aged rats.\nC_LI",

It contains precisely positioned array of alternating sensory hair cells (HC) and non-sensory supporting cells that emerge during embryonic development from an initially disordered pro-sensory domain. While much is known on the genetics and biochemistry underlying this process, it is still unclear how such precise alternating patterns emerge during embryonic development. Here, we combine live imaging of mouse inner ear explants with hybrid mechano-regulatory models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the formation of a single row of inner HC (IHC). We show that a narrow strip of initially disordered salt-and-pepper pattern, generated by Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, is dynamically refined by coordinated intercalations, delaminations, and differential adhesion. We identify a new morphological transition, termed  hopping intercalation, that allows nascent IHC to  hop under the apical plane into their final position. We further show that IHC patterning is associated with boundary localization of the cell adhesion molecules, Nectin-3 and Nectin-1. Our experimental results and modeling support a mechanism for precise patterning based on a feedback between Notch-mediated differentiation and mechanically driven cellular reorganization that is likely relevant for many developmental processes.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that first emerged in late 2019 and has since triggered a pandemic of acute respiratory disease named COVID-19 which poses a significant threat to all public health institutions in the absence of specific antiviral treatment. Since the outbreak began in March 2020, India has reported 4.77 lakh Coronavirus deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The innate RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, on the other hand, allows for the development of nucleic acid-based antiviral drugs in which complementary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of target mRNA. Therefore, in this current study, the potential of RNAi was harnessed to construct siRNA molecules that target the consensus regions of specific structural proteins associated genes of SARS-CoV-2, such as the envelope protein gene (E), membrane protein gene (M), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene (N), and surface glycoprotein gene (S) which are important for the viral pathogenesis. Conserved sequences of 811 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around India were collected to design 21 nucleotides long siRNA duplex based on various computational algorithms and parameters targeting E, M, N and S genes. The proposed siRNA molecules possessed sufficient nucleotide-based and other features for effective gene silencing and BLAST results revealed that siRNAs targets have no significant matches across the whole human genome and hence, siRNAs were found to have no off-target effects on the genome, ruling out the possibility of off-target silencing. Finally, out of 157 computationally identified siRNAs, only 4 effective siRNA molecules were selected for each target gene which is proposed to exert the best action based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature, heat capacity and molecular docking analysis with Human AGO2 protein. Our engineered siRNA candidates could be used as a genome-level therapeutic treatment against various sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains in India. However, future applications will necessitate additional validations in vitro and in vivo animal models.",

    "abstract": "MotivationStudying the interaction or co-expression of the proteins or markers in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of cancer subjects can be crucial in the assessment of risks, such as death or recurrence. In the conventional approach, the cells need to be declared positive or negative for a marker based on its intensity. For multiple markers, manual thresholds are required for each marker, which can become cumbersome. The performance of the subsequent analysis relies heavily on this step and thus suffers from subjectivity and lacks robustness.\n\nResultsWe present a new method where different marker intensities are viewed as dependent random variables, and the mutual information (MI) between them is considered to be a metric of co-expression. Estimation of the joint density, as required in the traditional form of MI, becomes increasingly challenging as the number of markers increases. We consider an alternative formulation of MI which is conceptually similar but has an efficient estimation technique for which we develop a new generalization. With the proposed method, we analyzed a lung cancer dataset finding the co-expression of the markers, HLA-DR and CK to be associated with survival. We also analyzed a triple negative breast cancer dataset finding the co-expression of the immuno-regulatory proteins, PD1, PD-L1, Lag3 and IDO, to be associated with disease recurrence. We demonstrated the robustness of our method through different simulation studies.\n\nAvailabilityThe associated R package can be found here, https://github.com/sealx017/MIAMI.\n\nContactsouvik.seal@cuanschutz.edu\n\nSupplementary informationThe Supplementary Material is attached.",

These compounds synthesized by Madera Therapeutics showed increased potency of cancer growth inhibition over the related compound ONC201. In this study, we describe chemical optimization and characterization of the next generation of highly potent and selective small molecule ClpP activators (TR compounds) and demonstrate their efficacy against breast cancer models in vitro and in vivo. One of these compounds (TR-107) with excellent potency, specificity and drug-like properties was selected for further evaluation. Examination of TR-107 effects in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell models showed growth inhibition in the low nanomolar range, equipotent to paclitaxel, in a ClpP-dependent manner. TR-107 reduced specific mitochondrial proteins including OXPHOS and TCA cycle components, in a time, dose and ClpP-dependent manner. Seahorse XF analysis and glucose deprivation experiments confirmed inactivation of OXPHOS and demonstrated an increased dependence on glycolysis following TR-107 exposure. The pharmacokinetic properties of TR-107 were compared to other known ClpP activators including ONC201 and ONC212. TR-107 displayed excellent exposure and serum t1/2 after oral administration. The antitumor response to TR-107 was investigated using human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line-induced xenograft tumors. Oral administration of TR-107 resulted in reduction in tumor volume and extension of survival in the treated compared with vehicle control mice. In summary, we describe the identification of highly potent new ClpP agonists with improved efficacy against TNBC, through targeted inactivation of OXPHOS and disruption of mitochondrial metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing technology have provided unprecedented opportunities to simultaneously measure the gene expression profile and transcriptional velocity of individual cells, enabling us to sample gene regulatory network dynamics along developmental trajectories. However, traditional methods have faced challenges in modeling gene expression dynamics within individual cells due to sparse, non-linear (e.g., obligate heterodimer transcription factors), and high-dimensional measurements. Here, we present DeepVelo, a neural-network-based ordinary differential equation model that can learn non-linear, high-dimensional single-cell transcriptome dynamics and describe continuous gene expression changes within individual cells across time. We applied DeepVelo to multiple published datasets from different technical platforms and demonstrated its utility to 1) formulate transcriptome dynamics on different timescales, 2) measure the instability of cell states, and 3) identify developmental driver genes upstream of a signaling cascade. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods shows that DeepVelo can improve velocity field representation accuracy by at least 50% in out-of-sample cells. Further, perturbation studies revealed that single-cell dynamical systems may exhibit properties similar to those of chaotic systems. In summary, DeepVelo allows for the data-driven discovery of differential equations that delineate single-cell transcriptome dynamics.\n\nTeaserEmbedding neural networks into ordinary differential equations to model gene expression changes within single cells across time.",

To compare the effect of an Omicron-matched S DNA vaccine and an ancestral S DNA vaccine in boosting cross-reactive immunities, we firstly immunized mice with two-dose of a DNA vaccine encoding the spike protein of the ancestral Wuhan strain. Then the mice were boosted with DNA vaccines encoding spike proteins of either the Wuhan strain or the Omicron variant. Specific antibody and T cell responses were measured at 4 weeks post boost. Our data showed that the Omicron-matched vaccine efficiently boosted RBD binding antibody and neutralizing antibody responses against both the Delta and the Omicron variants. Of note, antibody responses against the Omicron variant elicited by the Omicron-matched vaccine were much stronger than those induced by the ancestral S DNA vaccine. Meanwhile, CD8+ T cell responses against both the ancestral Wuhan strain and the Omicron strain also tended to be higher in mice boosted by the Omicron-matched vaccine than those in mice boosted with the ancestral S DNA vaccine, albeit no significant difference was observed. Our findings suggest that an Omicron-matched vaccine is preferred for boosting cross-reactive immunities.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti, the main vector of multiple arboviruses, is highly associated with human dwellings. Females exhibit an opportunistic oviposition behavior, seldomly laying eggs on natural containers, but rather distributing them among human-generated breeding sites. Bacterial communities associated with such sites, as well as the compositional shifts they undergo through the development of larval stages, have been described. Some bacteria can play a direct role in supporting the success of mosquito development. Additionally, exposure to different bacteria during larval phases can have an impact on life-history traits. Whether the larvae acquire symbionts from aquatic niches, or just require bacteria as food, is still debated. Based on these facts, we hypothesized that female Ae. aegypti shape the bacterial communities of breeding sites during oviposition as a form of niche construction to favor offspring fitness. Our study presents a series of experiments to address whether gravid females modify bacterial consortia present in larval habitats. For this, we first verified if females can mechanically transfer bacteria into culture media. As evidence of mechanical transmission was obtained, we then elaborated an experimental scheme to dissect effects from factors related to the act of oviposition and mosquito-egg-water interactions. The DNA samples obtained from breeding site water belonging to five treatments were subjected to amplicon-oriented sequencing to infer their bacterial community structure. Microbial ecology analyses revealed significant differences between treatments in terms of diversity. Particularly, between-treatment shifts in abundance profiles were detected, also showing that females induce a significant decrease in alpha diversity through oviposition. In addition, indicator species analysis pinpointed bacterial taxa with significant predicting values and fidelity coefficients for the samples in which single females laid eggs. Furthermore, we provide evidence regarding how one of these indicator taxa, Elizabethkingia, exerts a positive effect upon the development and fitness of mosquito larvae, thus suggesting that the developmental niche construction hypothesis may hold in this model.",

    "abstract": "Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved, adaptive component of social behavior. Studies in male mice illustrate that aggression is influenced by numerous factors including the degree to which an individual finds aggression rewarding and will work for access to attack and subordinate mice. While such studies have expanded our understanding of the molecular and circuit mechanisms of male aggression very little is known about female aggression, owed in part to limited availability of valid mouse models in females. Here we use an ethologically relevant model of male vs. female aggression by pair housing adult male and female outbred CFW mice with opposite sex cage mates. We assess reactive (defensive) aggression in the resident intruder (RI) test and appetitive (rewarding) aggression in the aggression conditioned place preference (CPP) and operant self-administration (SA) tests. Our results show dramatic sex differences in both qualitative and quantitative aspects of reactive vs. appetitive aggression. Males exhibit more wrestling and less investigative behavior during RI, find aggression rewarding and will work for access to a subordinate to attack. Females exhibit more bites, alternate between aggressive behaviors and investigative behaviors more readily during RI, however, they do not find aggression to be rewarding or reinforcing. These results establish sex differences in aggression in mice, providing an important resource for the field to better understand the circuit and molecular mechanisms of aggression in both sexes.",

    "abstract": "The lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) is reliably active during working memory (WM) across human and animal models, but the role of lPFC in successful WM is under debate. For instance, non-human primate (NHP) electrophysiology research finds that lPFC circuitry stores WM representations. Human neuroimaging instead suggests that lPFC plays a control function over WM content that is stored in sensory cortices. These seemingly incompatible WM accounts are often confounded by differences in the amount of task training and stimulus exposure across studies (i.e., NHPs tend to be trained extensively). Here, we test the possibility that such long-term training may alter the role of lPFC in WM maintenance. We densely sampled WM-related activity across learning, in three human participants, using a longitudinal functional MRI (fMRI) protocol. Over three months, participants trained on (1) a serial reaction time (SRT) task, wherein complex fractal stimuli were embedded within probabilistic sequences, and (2) a delayed recognition task probing WM for trained or novel stimuli. Participants were scanned frequently throughout training, to track how WM activity patterns change with repeated stimulus exposure and long-term associative learning. WM task performance improved for trained (but not novel) fractals and, neurally, delay activity significantly increased in distributed lPFC voxels across learning. Pattern similarity analyses also found that item-level WM representations became detectable within lPFC, but not in sensory cortices, and lPFC delay activity increasingly reflected sequence relationships from the SRT task, even though that information was task-irrelevant for WM. These findings demonstrate that human lPFC can show stimulus-selective WM responses with learning and WM representations are shaped by long-term experience. Therefore, influences from training and long-term memory may reconcile competing accounts of lPFC function during WM.",

    "abstract": "The claustrum is a small subcortical structure with widespread connections with disparate regions of the cortex. These far-reaching projections have led to many hypotheses concerning its function. However, we know little about how claustrum input affects neural activity in cortex, particularly beyond frontal areas. Here, using optogenetics and multi-regional Neuropixels recordings from over 15,000 neurons in awake mice, we demonstrate that the effect of claustrum input differs depending on brain area, layer, and cell type. Brief claustrum stimulation produces approximately 1 spike per claustrum neuron, which affects many fast-spiking (FS; putative inhibitory) but very few regular-spiking (RS; putative excitatory) cortical neurons. Prolonged claustrum stimulation affects many more cortical FS and RS neurons. More inhibition occurs in frontal regions and deeper layers, while more excitation occurs in posterior regions and superficial layers. These differences imply that the function of claustrum input to cortex depends on the area, supporting the idea that claustro-cortical circuits are organized into functional modules.",

Here we focus on the task of storage and recall of structured knowledge in long-term memory. Specifically, we ask how recurrent neuronal networks can store and retrieve multiple knowledge structures. We model each structure as a set of binary relations between events and attributes (attributes may represent e.g., temporal order, spatial location, role in semantic structure), and map each structure to a distributed neuronal activity pattern using a vector symbolic architecture (VSA) scheme.\n\nWe then use associative memory plasticity rules to store the binarized patterns as fixed points in a recurrent network. By a combination of signal-to-noise analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model allows for efficient storage of these knowledge structures, such that the memorized structures as well as their individual building blocks (e.g., events and attributes) can be subsequently retrieved from partial retrieving cues. We show that long-term memory of structured knowledge relies on a new principle of computation beyond the memory basins. Finally, we show that our model can be extended to store sequences of memories as single attractors.",

    "abstract": "Due to their immunosuppressive role, tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (TI-Tregs) represent attractive therapeutic targets. Analysis of TI vs. peripheral Tregs (P-Tregs) from 36 patients, across four malignancies, identified 17 candidate Master Regulators (MRs), predicted to mechanistically regulate TI-Tregs transcriptional state. In vivo, pooled CRISPR-KO screening, using a hematopoietic stem cell transplant model, confirmed essentiality of 7 of 17 MRs in TI-Treg recruitment and/or retention to the TME, without affecting other T cell subtypes, while individual knockout of the most significant MR (TRPS1) significantly reduced tumor allograft growth. TI-Treg drug perturbation profile analysis identified drugs capable of inverting the TI-Treg-specific MR activity signature at low concentration. Low dose treatment with gemcitabine (top prediction) inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent but not immunocompromised allografts, increased PD-1 inhibitor efficacy, and depleted TI-Tregs in vivo. The study provides key insight into Treg infiltration mechanism and a gene reporter assay to identify additional small molecule inhibitors.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/481404v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cca60borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a93ce6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dd2aa2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a2c98_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity is a key aspect of biological variation for the adaptability and survival of populations of species, which must be monitored to assure maintenance. We used data from the Swedish Red-List 2020 and a recent government report to apply three indicators for genetic diversity proposed for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). We made more detailed indicator assessments for mammals and herptiles.\n\nFor indicator 1, the proportion of populations with effective population size Ne>500, 33% of 22557 investigated species had a population estimate. For herptiles and mammals, 70% and 49%, respectively likely had Ne>500.\n\nFor indicator 2, the proportion of populations or range remaining within species, 20% of all species evaluated for the Red-List have data. Meanwhile, 32% of the herptile and 84% of the mammal populations are maintaining their populations/range.\n\nFor indicator 3, the number of species/populations in which genetic diversity is monitored using DNA-based methods, there are studies on 3% of species, and 0.3% are monitored. In contrast 68% of mammals and 29% of herptiles are studied using DNA, and 8% of mammals and 24% of herptiles are genetically monitored.\n\nWe conclude that the Red List provide data suitable for evaluating the genetic indicators, but the data quality can be improved. There is a synergy in estimating the genetic indicators in parallel with the Red-Listing process. We propose that indicator values could be included in national Red-Listing as a new category - \"genetically threatened\", based on the genetic indicators.",

    "abstract": "Herring gulls are one of few species thriving in anthropogenic landscapes. Their history of urbanisation and familiarity with people makes them a good target for studies of human-wildlife interactions. Previous research highlights a connection between food-stealing behaviour, success in anthropogenic areas, and increased attention towards humans, raising questions about the exact extent of a gulls knowledge of human food cues. To explore these, behavioural responses to human cues in a food-related context were investigated and presented in a systematic ethogram, which identified three distinct markers of attention. Head turns, approaches, and angular body position all differed significantly between control and food conditions, showing that attention towards humans in a food-related context was upregulated and reflected in behaviour. In food condition trials, head turns occurred more often and gulls faced towards the experimenter with occasional approaches that were never seen in control conditions. Additionally, juvenile gulls exhibited less head turns, indicating lower vigilance, while neither approaches nor pecks differed between age groups. Interestingly, no group effects on attentional markers were found. Acoustic and behavioural human food-like cues alone seemed insufficient to elicit these responses, indicating that gulls specifically paid attention to the details of human behaviour. These results show situation-dependent attentional modulation in gulls and provide a description of attentive behaviours that can be used in further study.\n\nSummaryUrbanised herring gulls successfully benefited from anthropogenic food sources. We showed that human food-centred behaviours directly modulated the attentional states of gulls.",

    "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the most common cancer types with various treatment modalities. However, better biomarkers to predict therapeutic response are still needed to improve precision medicine. We utilized a consensus hierarchical clustering approach on 509 LUAD cases from TCGA to identify five robust LUAD expression subtypes. We then integrated genomic (patient and cell line) and proteomic data to help define biomarkers of response to targeted therapies and immunotherapies. This approach defined subtypes with unique proteogenomic and dependency profiles. S4-associated cell lines exhibited specific vulnerability to CDK6 and CDK6-cyclin D3 complex gene, CCND3. S3 was characterized by dependency on CDK4, immune-related expression patterns, and altered MET signaling; experimental validation showed that S3-associated cell lines responded to MET inhibitors, leading to increased PD-L1 expression. We further identified genomic features in S3 and S4 as biomarkers for enabling clinical diagnosis of these subtypes. Overall, our consensus hierarchical clustering approach identified robust tumor expression subtypes, and our subsequent integrative analysis of genomics, proteomics, and CRISPR screening data revealed subtype-specific biology and vulnerabilities. Our lung adenocarcinoma expression subtypes and their biomarkers could help identify patients likely to respond to CDK4/6, MET, or PD-L1 inhibitors, potentially improving patient outcome.\n\nSignificanceThrough integrative analysis of genomic, proteomic, and drug dependency data, we identified robust lung adenocarcinoma expression subtypes and found subtype-specific biomarkers of response, including CDK4/6, MET, and PD-L1 inhibitors.",

A growing field working to strengthen those connections exists within the informal STEM learning (ISL) community which provides diverse learning and engagement environments outside the formal classroom. One of the largest funders of ISL initiatives is the National Science Foundation (NSF) which runs the Advanced Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program in the United States. The AISL program supports initiatives through six categories that include pilots and feasibility studies, research in service to practice, innovations in development, broad implementation, literature reviews, syntheses, or meta-analyses, and conferences. However, a number of questions remain unanswered with respect to the distribution and ultimately the broad impact of the awards. In this study, we analyzed publicly available awardee information across a 15-year period (2006-2021) to provide a preliminary analysis of how the AISL grants are distributed across individual states, organizations, and the principal investigators. Several states, organizations, and principal investigators stood out as prolific awardees. Massachusetts and California represented the largest share of awards at 14% and 13% respectively during that time. WGBH Educational Foundation located in Massachusetts and the Exploratorium located in California, received the largest number of awards during the 15 year period. Notably, 67% of the AISL awards list at least one co-principal investigator. Our report brings to light a number of new questions and charts new paths of exploration for future studies.",

While much is known about how stage-specific transcription is activated, less is understood about how inappropriate gene expression is suppressed. In this paper we demonstrate that Groucho, the Drosophila orthologue of TLE1 and other related human transcriptional corepressors, regulates cell cycle progression in vivo. We show that although Groucho is expressed throughout the cell cycle, its activity is selectively inactivated by phosphorylation, except during S-phase when it represses e2f1 expression. Misregulated Groucho activity causes cell cycle arrest; in particular, both constitutive Groucho activity and failure to repress e2f1 cause cell cycle arrest phenotypes. We also show that the Cdk1 kinase is responsible for stage-specific phosphorylation of Groucho in vivo. We propose that Groucho and its orthologues play key roles in the metazoan cell cycle that may explain the links between TLE corepressors and several types of human cancer.",

    "abstract": "Despite its critical role in neurodevelopment and brain function, vitamin-D (vit-D) homeostasis, metabolism and kinetics within the central nervous system remain largely undetermined. Thus, it is of critical importance to establish an accurate, highly sensitive and reproducible method to quantitate vit-D in brain tissue. Here, we present a novel liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method and for the first time, demonstrate detection of seven major vit-D metabolites in brain tissues of C57BL/6J wild-type mice, namely: 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-1,25(OH)2D3, 1,25(OH)2D2, 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, 24,25(OH)2D3, and 24,25(OH)2D2. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a pentaflurophenyol column 3 mM ammonium formate with water/methanol [A] and methanol/isopropanol [B] phases. Detection was by positive-ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. We used calibration standards of each metabolite prepared in brain matrices to validate the detection range, precision, accuracy and recovery. Isotopically labelled analogues, 1,25(OH)2D3-d3, 25(OH)D3-C5 and 24,25(OH)2D3-d6, served as the internal standards for the closest molecular related metabolite in all measurements. The calibration range was between 1 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with an LLOD and LLOQ of 10 fg/mL and 3 fg/mL, respectively. The intra-/inter-day precision and accuracy for measuring brain vit-D metabolites ranged between 0.12-11.53% and 0.28-9.11%, respectively. Recovery ranged between 99.06% and 106.9% for all metabolites. Collectively, the sensitivity and efficiency of our method supersedes previously reported protocols used to measure vit-D and to our knowledge, the first protocol to reveal the abundance of 25(OH)D2, 1,25(OH)D2 and 24,25(OH)2D2, in brain tissue of any species. This technique may be important in supporting the future advancement of pre-clinical research into the function of vit-D in neurophysiological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegeneration.",

The theory is based on a novel recursive version of support vector regression that allows for efficient continuous learning that is only limited by the representational capacity of the reservoir. The paper argues that hippocampal theta sequences are a potential neural substrate underlying this reservoir.The theory is consistent with confabulations and post-hoc alterations of existing memories.",

    "abstract": "The physiologic basis underlying the long-term consequences of repetitive, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains poorly understood. Mild traumatic brain injury often results in brief loss of consciousness, impaired attention and concentration, memory problems, impulsivity, and headache, without objective findings on clinical imaging or examination. The effects of mTBI can persist and become cumulative with repetitive injury, suggesting global alterations in cortical networks. Using transparent polymer skulls, we performed mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging in mice to evaluate how repetitive mTBI alters patterns of neuronal interactions across the dorsal cerebral cortex. Spatial Independent Component Analysis (sICA) and Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF) were used to quantify changes in cerebral functional connectivity (FC). Repetitive, mild, controlled cortical impacts induce temporary neuroinflammatory responses, characterized by increased density of microglia exhibiting de-ramified morphology. These temporary neuro-inflammatory changes were not associated with compromised cognitive performance in the Barnes maze or motor function as assessed by rotarod. However, long-term alterations in functional connectivity were observed. Widespread, bilateral changes in FC occurred immediately following impact and persisted for up to 7 weeks, the duration of the experiment. Network alterations include decreases in global efficiency, clustering coefficient, and nodal strength, thereby disrupting functional interactions and information flow throughout the dorsal cerebral cortex. A subnetwork analysis shows the largest disruptions in FC were concentrated near the impact site. Therefore, repetitive mTBI induces a transient neuroinflammation, without alterations in cognitive or motor behavior, and a reorganized cortical network evidenced by the widespread, chronic alterations in cortical FC.\n\nSignificance StatementMore than 2.5 million individuals in the United States suffer minor traumatic brain injuries annually. Because these injuries are typically not associated with visible anatomic injuries or objective clinical findings, they were thought benign and fully recoverable. However, there is increasing awareness of the long-term deleterious consequences, particularly in patients who suffer repeated mTBI. Using long-term, mesoscopic neuronal Ca2+ imaging to characterize the dorsal cerebral cortical connectome following repetitive mTBI, we show extensive, persistent changes in functional connectivity, not only at the site of injury but throughout the cortex. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of mTBI.",

    "abstract": "Stress triggers anticipatory physiological responses that promote survival, a phenomenon termed allostasis. However, the chronic activation of energy-dependent allostatic responses results in allostatic load, a dysregulated state that predicts functional decline, accelerates aging, and increases mortality in humans. The energetic cost and cellular basis for the damaging effects of allostatic load have not been defined. Here, by longitudinally profiling three unrelated primary human fibroblast lines across their lifespan, we find that chronic glucocorticoid exposure increases cellular energy expenditure by [~]60%, along with a metabolic shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This state of stress-induced hypermetabolism is linked to mtDNA instability, non-linearly affects age-related cytokines secretion, and accelerates cellular aging based on DNA methylation clocks, telomere shortening rate, and reduced lifespan. Pharmacologically normalizing OxPhos activity while further increasing energy expenditure exacerbates the accelerated aging phenotype, pointing to total energy expenditure as a potential driver of aging dynamics. Together, our findings define bioenergetic and multi-omic recalibrations of stress adaptation, underscoring increased energy expenditure and accelerated cellular aging as interrelated features of cellular allostatic load.",

This has led to considerable interest in defining the mechanisms responsible for regulating mitochondria during ER stress. The PERK signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) has emerged as a prominent ER stress-responsive signaling pathway that regulates diverse aspects of mitochondrial biology. Here, we show that PERK activity also promotes adaptive remodeling of mitochondrial membrane phosphatidic acid (PA) to induce protective mitochondrial elongation during ER stress. We find that PERK activity is required for ER stress-dependent increases in both cellular PA and YME1L-dependent degradation of the intramitochondrial PA transporter PRELID1. Together, these processes lead to the accumulation of PA on the outer mitochondrial membrane where it induces mitochondrial elongation by inhibiting mitochondrial fission. Our results establish a new role for PERK in the adaptive remodeling of mitochondrial phospholipids and demonstrate that PERK-dependent PA regulation functions to adapt organellar shape in response to ER stress.",

    "abstract": "The establishment and maintenance of different cellular compartments in tissues is a universal requirement across all metazoans. Maintaining the correct ratio of cell types in time and space allows tissues to form patterned compartments and perform complex functions. Patterning is especially evident in the human colon, where tissue homeostasis is maintained by stem cells in crypt structures that balance proliferation and differentiation. Here we developed a 2D patient derived organoid (PDO) screening platform to study tissue patterning and kinase pathway dynamics in single cells across hundreds of conditions. Using this system, we discovered that waves of Erk signaling induced by apoptotic cells play a critical role in maintaining tissue patterning and homeostasis. If Erk is activated acutely across all cells instead of in wavelike patterns, then tissue patterning, and stem cell maintenance are lost. Conversely, if Erk activity is inhibited, then stem cells become unrestricted and expand dramatically. This work demonstrates that the colonic epithelium requires coordinated Erk signaling dynamics to maintain patterning and tissue homeostasis. Our work reveals how Erk can antagonize stem cells yet support cell replacement and the function of the gut.",

    "abstract": "Apart from DNA-sequence-based inheritance, inheritance of epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation is controversial across the tree of life. In mammals, post-fertilization and primordial germ cell reprogramming processes erased most parental DNA methylation information. In nonmammalian vertebrates and insects, it has been proposed that DNA methylation is an essential hereditary carrier. However, how and to what extent general DNA methylation reprogramming affects intergenerational inheritance in molluscs remains unclear. Here, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation in a mollusc model, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), to test how epigenetic information transfers from parents to offspring. Analysis of global methylome revealed that the DNA methylation patterns are highly conserved within families. Almost half of the differentially methylated CpG dinucleotides (DMCs) between families in parents could transfer to offspring. These results provided the direct evidence for the hypothesis that the Pacific oyster DNA methylation patterns are inherited in generations. Moreover, distinct DNA methylation differences between male and female somatic tissues in C. gigas are revealed in this study. These sex-differential methylated genes significantly enriched in the regulation of Rho protein signal transduction process, which indicated that DNA methylation might have an essential role in the sexual differentiation of somatic tissues in C. gigas.\n\nAuthor SummaryTransgenerational inheritance of DNA methylation marks varies across the tree of life. In mammals, post-fertilization and primordial germ cell reprogramming processes obstructed the DNA methylation transmission from parents to child, and only some CpG dinucleotides retain gamete-inherited methylation. However, the DNA methylation inheritance seems apparent in nonmammalian vertebrates and insects. As one of the essential mollusc models, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas have received the most substantial epigenetic studies, mainly focusing on the DNA methylation profiles. While a previous study suggested the existence of paternal inheritance of DNA methylation patterns in C. gigas, more data are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In this study, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed to investigate the epigenetic inheritance in C. gigas. Almost half of the DNA methylation differences between families in parents were found to be transferred to children, indicating the absence of global DNA methylation reprogramming in C. gigas. Besides, extensive hypomethylation in C. gigas females compared with males were also unveiled. These hypomethylated genes were significantly enriched in the regulation of Rho protein signal transduction process. For example, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, including KALRN, FGD1, and FGD6, were hypomethylated in C. gigas females, and the corresponding transcriptions were significantly upregulated. Our findings provided insights into the evolution of DNA methylation patterns, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, and sexual differentiation in molluscs.",

In Papilio polytes, female-limited Batesian mimicry is thought to be regulated by a ~130kb inversion region (highly diversified region: HDR) containing three genes, UXT, U3X and doublesex (dsx) which switches non-mimetic and mimetic types. To determine the functional unit, we here performed electroporation-mediated RNAi analyses (and further Crispr/Cas9 for UXT) of genes within and flanking the HDR in pupal hindwings. We first clarified that non-mimetic dsx-h had a function to switch from male to non-mimetic female and only dsx-H isoform 3 had an important function in the formation of mimetic traits. Next, we found that UXT was involved in making mimetic type pale-yellow spots and adjacent gene sir2 removed excess red spots in hindwings, both of which refine more elaborate mimicry. Furthermore, downstream gene networks of dsx, U3X and UXT screened by RNA sequencing showed that U3X upregulated dsx expression and repressed UXT expression. These findings demonstrate that a set of multiple genes, not only inside but also flanking HDR, can function as supergene members, which extends the definition of supergene unit than we considered before. Also, our results indicate that dsx-H functions as the switching gene and some other genes such as UXT and sir2 within the supergene unit work as the modifier gene.\n\nArticle summarySupergenes are thought to control complex adaptive traits, but their detailed function are poorly understood. In Papilio polytes, female-limited Batesian mimicry is regulated by an ~130kb inversion region (highly divergent region: HDR) containing three genes. Our functional analysis showed that doublesex switches the mimicry polymorphism, and that an inside gene UXT and an outside gene sir2 to the HDR work to refine more elaborate mimicry. We here succeed in defining the unit of mimicry supergene and some novel modifier genes.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of maize and other eukaryotes contain stable haplotypes in regions of low recombination. These regions, including centromeres, long heterochromatic blocks and rDNA arrays have been difficult to analyze with respect to their diversity and origin. Greatly improved genome assemblies are now available that enable comparative genomics over these and other non-genic spaces. Using 26 complete maize genomes, we developed methods to align intergenic sequences while excluding genes and regulatory regions. The centromere haplotypes (cenhaps) extend for megabases on either side of the functional centromere regions and appear as evolutionary strata, with haplotype divergence/coalescence times dating as far back as 450 thousand years ago (kya). Application of the same methods to other low recombination regions (heterochromatic knobs and rDNA) and all intergenic spaces revealed that deep coalescence times are ubiquitous across the maize pan-genome. Divergence estimates vary over a broad time scale with peaks at [~]300 kya and 16 kya, reflecting a complex history of gene flow among diverging populations and changes in population size associated with domestication. Cenhaps and other long haplotypes provide vivid displays of this ancient diversity.",

    "abstract": "DEAD-box RNA helicases are implicated in most aspects of RNA biology, where these enzymes unwind short RNA duplexes in an ATP-dependent manner. During the central step of the unwinding cycle, the two domains of the helicase core form a distinct closed conformation that destabilizes the RNA duplex, which ultimately leads to duplex melting. Despite the importance of this step for the unwinding process no high resolution structures of this state are available. Here, we employ nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to determine structures of the DEAD- box helicase DbpA in the closed conformation, complexed with substrate duplexes and single- stranded unwinding product. These structures reveal that DbpA initiates duplex unwinding by interacting with up to three base-paired nucleotides and a 5 single-stranded RNA duplex overhang. These high-resolution snapshots, together with biochemical assays, rationalize the destabilization of the RNA duplex and are integrated into a conclusive model of the unwinding process.",

    "abstract": "The human RAD52 protein is thought to have multiple roles in the mechanisms of repairing DNA double-strand breaks that are caused by replication errors and reactive oxygen species. One such role is to mediate the formation of a displacement loop (D-loop), which is a critical reaction intermediate in homologous recombinational repair. RAD52 is suggested to promote the formation of D-loops when facilitating DNA synthesis at stalled or collapsed replication forks during mitosis. However, RAD52-mediated D-loop formation remains poorly characterized, and the detailed molecular mechanism of the D-loop formation reaction catalyzed by RAD52 is still unclear. In the present study, we developed a gel-based assay that enables rapid detection of RAD52-mediated D-loop formation. This assay utilizes a fluorophore-labeled, single-stranded DNA substrate. In addition to the rapid detection of D-loops, D-loop extension was observed when DNA polymerase was added to the reaction. This assay can also be used for screening large numbers of compounds that either stimulate or inhibit RAD52-mediated D-loop formation. The D-loop formation assay developed in this study is potentially useful for mechanistic studies of DSB repair involving RAD52-mediated D-loop formation, as well as for screening compounds with potential therapeutic effects.",

    "abstract": "Cell culture devices, such as microwells and microfluidic chips, are designed to increase the complexity of cell-based models whilst retaining control over culture conditions and have become indispensable platforms for biological systems modelling. From microtopography, microwells, plating devices and microfluidic systems to larger constructs for specific applications such as live imaging chamber slides, a wide variety of culture devices with different geometries have become indispensable in biology laboratories. However, while their application in biological projects is increasing exponentially, due to a combination of the techniques and tools required for their manufacture, and the physical science background sometimes needed, the design and fabrication of such devices directly by biological labs remains a relatively high investment in terms of costs, use of facilities, needed collaborations and time. Whilst commercially available systems are available, these are also often costly, and importantly lack the potential for customisation by each single lab. This combination of factors still limits widespread application of microfabricated custom devices in most biological wet labs.\n\nCapitalising on recent important advancements in the fields of bioengineering and microfabrication, and taking advantage of low-cost, high-resolution desktop resin 3D printers combined with PDMS soft lithography, we have developed an optimised low-cost and highly reproducible microfabrication pipeline, capable of generating a wide variety of customisable devices for cell culture and tissue engineering in an easy, fast reproducible way for a fraction of the cost of conventional microfabrication or commercial alternatives. This protocol is designed specifically to be a resource for biological labs with little to none prior exposure to these fields technique and enables the manufacture of complex devices across the {micro}m to cm scale.\n\nWe provide a ready-to-go pipeline for the efficient treatment of resin-based 3D printed constructs for PDMS curing, using a combination of curing steps, washes and surface treatments. Together with the extensive characterisation of the fabrication pipeline, we show the utilization of this system to a variety of applications and use cases relevant to biological experiments, ranging from micro topographies for cell alignments to complex multi-part hydrogel culturing systems.\n\nThis methodology can be easily adopted by any wet lab, irrespective of prior expertise or resource availability and will enable the wide adoption of tailored microfabricated devices across many fields of biology.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Omicron (B.1.1.529), a new Variant of Concern in the COVID-19 outbreak, while accompanied by the ongoing Delta variant infection, has once again fueled fears of a new infection wave and global health concern. In the Omicron variant, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein is heavily mutated, a feature critical for the transmission rate of the virus by interacting with hACE2. In this study, we used a combination of conventional and advanced neural network-based in silico approaches to predict how these mutations would affect the spike protein. The results demonstrated a decrease in the electrostatic potentials of residues corresponding to receptor recognition sites, an increase in the alkalinity of the protein, a change in hydrophobicity, variations in functional residues, and an increase in the percentage of alpha-helix structure. Our next step was to predict the structural changes of the spike protein using the AI-based tool Alphafold2 and dock it with hACE2. The results revealed that the RBD of the Omicron variant had a higher affinity than the reference. Moreover, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations concluded that the RBD of the Omicron variant exhibits a more dispersed interaction network since mutations resulted in an increased number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with hACE2 compared to the reference RBD. In summary, our current study highlighted the potential structural basis for the enhanced transmissibility and pathogenicity of the Omicron variant, although further research is needed to investigate its epidemiological and biological implications.",

    "abstract": "Reviewing the metabolomics literature is becoming increasingly difficult because of the rapid expansion of relevant journal literature. Text-mining technologies are therefore needed to facilitate more efficient literature review. Here we contribute a standardised corpus of full-text publications from metabolomics studies and describe the development of two new metabolite named entity recognition (NER) methods. We introduce two deep learning methods for metabolite NER based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks incorporating different transfer learning techniques. Our first model (MetaboListem) follows prior methodology using GloVe word embeddings. Our second model exploits BERT and BioBERT for embedding and is named TABoLiSTM (Transformer-Affixed BiLSTM). The methods are trained on a novel corpus annotated using rule-based methods, and evaluated on manually annotated metabolomics articles. MetaboListem (F1 score 0.890, precision 0.892, recall 0.888) and TABoLiSTM (BioBERT version: F1 score 0.909, precision 0.926, recall 0.893) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on metabolite NER. A corpus with >1,200 full-text Open Access metabolomics publications and >116,000 annotated metabolites was created. This work demonstrates that deep learning algorithms are capable of identifying metabolite names accurately and efficiently in text. The proposed corpus and NER algorithms can be used for metabolomics text-mining tasks such as information retrieval, document classification and literature-based discovery.\n\nAvailabilityThe corpus and NER algorithms are freely available with detailed instructions from Github at https://github.com/omicsNLP/MetaboliteNER.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is an endemic, chronic virus that leads to 800,000 deaths per year. Central to the HBV lifecycle, the viral core has a protein capsid assembled from many copies of a single protein. The capsid protein adopts different (quasi-equivalent) conformations to form icosahedral capsids containing 180 or 240 proteins, T=3 or T=4 respectively in Caspar-Klug nomenclature. HBV capsid assembly has become an important target for new antivirals; nonetheless the assembly pathways and mechanisms that control HBV dimorphism remain unclear. We describe computer simulations of HBV assembly, using a coarse-grained model that has parameters learned from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a complete HBV capsid, and yet is computationally tractable. Dynamical simulations with the resulting model reproduce experimental observations of HBV assembly pathways and products. By constructing Markov state models and employing transition path theory, we identify pathways leading to T=3, T=4, and other experimentally observed capsid morphologies. The analysis identifies factors that control this polymorphism, in particular, the conformational free energy landscape of the capsid proteins and their interactions.",

Although the exocytotic machinery controlling cellular secretion has been well investigated, the function of the vesicular cargo, i.e. secretory granular content remains obscure. Here we combine dSTORM imaging and single-domain insulin antibody, to dissect the in situ structure of insulin granule cores (IGCs) at nano level. We demonstrate that the size and shape of the IGCs can be regulated by the juxta-granular molecules Nucleobindin-2 and Enolase-1, that further contribute to the stimulated insulin secretion. IGCs located at the plasma membrane are larger than those in the cytosol. The IGCs size is decreased by [~]20% after glucose stimulation due to the release of the peripheral part of IGCs through incomplete granule fusion. Importantly, the reduction of the IGCs size is also observed in non-stimulatory pancreatic {beta}-cells from diabetic db/db mice, Akita (Ins2+/-) mice and human Type-2 diabetic donors, in accordance with impaired secretion. These findings overall highlight the structure of exocytotic insulin cores as a novel modality amenable to targeting in the stimulated exocytosis in {beta}-cells with impaired insulin secretion.",

    "abstract": "An objects colour, brightness and pattern are all influenced by its surroundings, and a number of visual phenomena and \"illusions\" have been discovered that highlight these often dramatic effects. Explanations for these phenomena range from low-level neural mechanisms to high-level processes that incorporate contextual information or prior knowledge. Importantly, few of these phenomena can currently be accounted for when measuring an objects perceived colour. Here we ask to what extent colour appearance is predicted by a model based on the principle of coding efficiency. The model assumes that the image is encoded by noisy spatio-chromatic filters at one octave separations, which are either circularly symmetrical or oriented. Each spatial bands lower threshold is set by the contrast sensitivity function, and the dynamic range of the band is a fixed multiple of this threshold, above which the response saturates. Filter outputs are then reweighted to give equal power in each channel for natural images. We demonstrate that the model fits human behavioural performance in psychophysics experiments, and also primate retinal ganglion responses. Next we systematically test the models ability to qualitatively predict over 35 brightness and colour phenomena, with almost complete success. This implies that contrary to high-level processing explanations, much of colour appearance is potentially attributable to simple mechanisms evolved for efficient coding of natural images, and is a basis for modelling the vision of humans and other animals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (autism) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with pronounced behavioural, cognitive, and neural heterogeneities across individuals. Here, our goal was to characterise heterogeneity in autism by identifying patterns of neural diversity as reflected in BOLD fMRI in the way individuals with autism engage with a varied array of cognitive tasks.\n\nMethodsAll analyses were based on the EU-AIMS/AIMS-2-TRIALS multisite Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) with participants with autism and typically developing controls (TD) between 6 and 30 years of age. We employed a novel task-potency approach which combines the unique aspects of both resting-state fMRI and task-fMRI to quantify task-induced variations in the functional connectome. Normative modelling was used to map atypicality of features on an individual basis with respect to their distribution in neurotypical control participants. We applied robust out-of-sample canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to relate connectome data to behavioural data.\n\nResultsDeviation from the normative ranges of global functional connectivity was greater for individuals with autism compared to TD in each fMRI task paradigm (all tasks p<0.001). The similarity across individuals of the deviation pattern was significantly increased in autistic relative to TD individuals (p<0.002). The CCA identified significant and robust brainbehavior covariation between functional connectivity atypicality and autism-related behavioral features.\n\nConclusionsIndividuals with autism engage with tasks in a globally atypical way, but the particular spatial pattern of this atypicality is nevertheless similar across tasks. Atypicalities in the tasks originate mostly from prefrontal cortex and default mode network regions, but also speech and auditory networks. We show, moving forward, sophisticated modeling methods such as task-potency and normative modeling will prove key to unravelling complex heterogeneous conditions like autism.",

The discovery that the survival of microglia in adult brains depends on the expression of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), along with the development of the effective brain permeant CSF1R inhibitors PLX5622, has boosted the investigation of the role of microglia in health, disease and in relations to sex-bias. The effectiveness of PLX5622 in examining the role of microglia has mainly been demonstrated in mice. Surprisingly, despite the critical importance of rat models in brain research, there are only 4 publications in which PLX5622 was used to investigate the roles of microglia in adult rats. This has been attributed to the \"impression\" that PLX5622 is \"ineffective in rats\". In view of the importance and interest in the role of microglia, the indispensability of rats for in vivo electrophysiological brain studies and behavioral research and the high efficacy of PLX5622-chow in eliminating microglia from adult mice brains, we examined the effects of PLX5622-chow on the elimination of the microglia in adult female and male rats. We found significant differences in microglia elimination by ad libitum PLX5622 feeding in male and female rats in different brain regions with significantly greater effectivity in female brains.

    "abstract": "Gq-coupled receptors regulate numerous physiological processes by activating enzymes and inducing intracellular Ca2+ signals. There is a strong need for an optogenetic tool that enables powerful experimental control over Gq signaling. Here, we present chicken opsin 5 (cOpn5) as the long sought-after, single-component optogenetic tool that mediates ultra-sensitive optical control of intracellular Gq signaling with high temporal and spatial resolution. Expressing cOpn5 in mammalian cells enables blue light-triggered, Gq-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and protein kinase C activation. Strong Ca2+ transients were evoked by brief light pulses of merely 10 ms duration and at 3 orders lower light intensity of that for common optogenetic tools. Photostimulation of cOpn5-expressing cells at the subcellular and single-cell levels generated intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ wave propagation, respectively, thus demonstrating the high spatial precision of cOpn5 optogenetics. The cOpn5-mediated optogenetics could also be applied to activate neurons and control animal behavior in a circuit-dependent manner. We further revealed that optogenetic activation of cOpn5-expressing astrocytes induced massive ATP release and modulation neuronal activation in the brain of awake, behaving mice. cOpn5 optogenetics may find broad applications in studying the mechanisms and functional relevance of Gq signaling in both non-excitable cells and excitable cells in all major organ systems.",

    "abstract": "Sensory hair cells receive near constant stimulation by omnipresent auditory and vestibular stimuli. To detect and encode these stimuli, hair cells require steady ATP production, which can be accompanied by a buildup of mitochondrial byproducts called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS buildup is thought to sensitize hair cells to ototoxic insults, including the antibiotic neomycin. Work in neurons has shown that neurotransmission is a major driver of ATP production and ROS buildup. Therefore, we tested whether neurotransmission is a significant contributor to ROS buildup in hair cells. Using genetics and pharmacology, we disrupted two key aspects of neurotransmission in zebrafish hair cells: presynaptic calcium influx and the fusion of synaptic vesicles. We find that chronic block of neurotransmission enhances hair-cell survival when challenged with the ototoxin neomycin. This reduction in ototoxin susceptibility is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial activity, likely due to a reduced ATP demand. In addition, we show that mitochondrial oxidation and ROS buildup is reduced when neurotransmission is blocked. Mechanistically, we find that it is the synaptic vesicle cycle rather than presynaptic- or mitochondrial-calcium influx that contributes most significantly to this metabolic stress. Our results comprehensively indicate that, over time, neurotransmission causes ROS buildup that increases the susceptibility of hair cells to ototoxins.",

    "abstract": "Subcortical circuits decode the output from multiple cortical areas to create commands for movement. By recording during monkeys smooth pursuit eye movements, we reveal how the dorsolateral pontine nucleus (DLPN) and nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) decode cortical output. Preparatory activity is inherited from the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields (FEFSEM). Consistent with its effects on eye movement responses to visual motion, preparatory activity modulates the gain of pontine responses to visual motion input from visual area MT. Furthermore, the \"place\" code for target speed in area MT becomes the motor commands \"rate\" code in the pons, through linear weighting of MTs output. The division into decoding that happens in the pons and residual computations that occur downstream reveals that the pons is neither a relay nor the source of a final motor command. It is part of a complex, distributed cortical decoder for motor control.",

    "abstract": "Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has caused more severe infections than its previous variants. We studied the host innate immune response to Delta, Alpha and two earlier variants to map the evolution of the recent ones. Our biochemical and transcriptomic studies reveal that Alpha and Delta have progressively evolved over the ancestral variants by silencing innate immune response, thereby limiting cytokine and chemokine production. Though Alpha silenced RLR pathway just as Delta, it failed to persistently silence the innate immune response unlike Delta. Both Alpha and Delta have evolved to resist IFN treatment while they are still susceptible to RLR activation, further highlighting the importance of RLR-mediated, IFN-independent mechanisms in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Our studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 Delta has integrated multiple mechanisms to silence host innate immune response and evade IFN response. Deltas silent replication and sustained suppression of host innate immune response, possibly resulting in delayed or reduced intervention by the adaptive immune response, could potentially contribute to the severe symptoms and poor recovery index associated with it.",

Despite the currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines ability to reduce severe disease and hospitalization, new immunization strategies are needed that enhance mucosal immune responses, inhibit community transmission, and provide protection against emerging variants. We have developed a mucosally delivered, non-replicating recombinant adenovirus vector (rAd5) vaccine, that has proven efficacy in the clinic against other respiratory viruses [1]. Here we evaluated the immunogenicity of three candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in cynomolgus macaques that contained spike (S) and/or nucleocapsid (N) from either the Wuhan or the beta variant to select a candidate for future clinical development. Mucosal immunization with the Wuhan specific S vaccine (ED90) induced significant cross-reactive serum IgG responses against to Wuhan, beta, gamma and delta lineages, and generated substantial serum neutralizing activity. In nasal samples, ED90 immunization induced 1000-fold increases in IgA to all variants of concern tested and had neutralizing activity against Wuhan and delta. While immunization with the beta specific vaccine (ED94) enhanced IgG and IgA responses to homologous beta variant S and RBD, this approach resulted in less cross-reactive responses to other variants in the serum and nasal passages compared to ED90. As ED90 immunization induced the most robust cross-reactive systemic and mucosal antibody responses, this candidate was chosen for future clinical development.",

A total 140 samples were considered, encompassing the medical devices of the hospital (100), housekeeping surfaces (15) and air (25). Susceptibility test for bacterial isolates was done by disk diffusion assay. Of the total 140 samples taken and analysed, 100% showed growth positivity. In most of the swabs taken, Coagulase Negative Staphylococci was dominant, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. Micrococcus spp., E coli, Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Fungi, and least Proteus spp. The dry surfaces were dominantly contaminated by gram positive bacteria whereas moistened surfaces like wash basin were contaminated by gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria. Total 277 strains were exposed to various class of antibiotics, among the gram positive environmental isolates, Coagulase Negative Staphylococci 16 (34.78%) had highest MDR prevalence followed by Staphylococcus aureus 8 (29.62%), Streptococcus spp. 4 (12.90%), Micrococcus spp. 4 (9.30%) and no MDR was shown by any Bacillus spp isolates.

We performed independently in vivo infection experiments to acquire extensive data for training and testing purposes of the models. We show here that lung viral load, neutrophil counts, cytokines like IFN-{gamma} and IL-6, and other lung infection markers can be predicted from hematological data. Furthermore, feature analysis of the models shows that blood granulocytes and platelets play a crucial role in prediction and are highly involved in the immune response against IAV.

    "abstract": "Wildlife animals may be susceptible for multiple infectious agents of public health or veterinary relevance, thereby potentially forming a reservoir that bears the constant risk of re-introduction into the human or livestock population. Here, we serologically investigated 493 wild ruminant samples collected in the 2021/22 hunting season in Germany for the presence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and four viruses pathogenic for domestic ruminants, namely the orthobunyavirus Schmallenberg virus (SBV), the reovirus bluetongue virus (BTV) and ruminant pestiviruses like bovine viral diarrhoea virus or border disease virus. The animal species comprised fallow deer, red deer, roe deer, mouflon and wisent. For coronavirus serology, additional 307 fallow, roe and red deer samples collected between 2017 and 2020 at three military training areas were included. While antibodies against SBV could be detected in about 13.6% of the samples collected in 2021/22, only one fallow deer of unknown age tested positive for anti-BTV antibodies and all samples reacted negative for antibodies against ruminant pestiviruses. In an ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, 25 out of 493 (5.1%) samples collected in autumn and winter 2021/22 scored positive. This sero-reactivity could not be confirmed by the highly specific virus neutralization test, occurred also in 2017, 2018 and 2019, i.e. prior to the human SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and was likewise observed against the RBD of the related SARS-CoV-1. Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2-seroreactivity was most likely induced by another, hitherto unknown deer virus belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus of betacoronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to bacteriophage infections protects bacteria in phage-full environments, allowing them to survive and multiply in the presence of their viral predators. However, such resistance may cause direct costs for strains linked with the ecological fitness expressed as reduced competitiveness for resources or reduced virulence or both. Unfortunately, limited knowledge exists about such costs paid by phage-resistant plant pathogenic bacteria in their natural environments. This study analyzed the costs of phage resistance paid by broad host phytopathogenic pectinolytic bacterium Dickeya solani both in vitro and in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants. Thirteen D. solani IPO 2222 Tn5 mutants were identified that exhibited resistance to infection caused by lytic bacteriophage vB_Dsol_D5 ({Phi}D5). The genes disrupted in these 13 mutants encoded proteins involved in the synthesis of the bacterial envelope components (viz. LPS, EPS and capsule). The ability of {Phi}D5-resistant D. solani mutants to colonize and cause symptoms on potato plants as well as other phenotypes that are known to contribute to the ecological fitness of D. solani in-plant environment, including growth rate, production of effectors, swimming and swarming motility, use of various carbon and nitrogen sources and biofilm formation were assessed. Although phage resistance did not affect most of the phenotypes of {Phi}D5-resistant D. solani evaluated in vitro, all phage resistant mutants were significantly compromised in their ability to survive on and colonize and cause disease symptoms in potato plants. This study is, to our knowledge, one of few to show the direct link between phage resistance and the fitness of plant pathogenic bacteria and the first one to assess phage-host associations for D. solani.",

Retroviral integration is mediated by the interaction of the MLV integrase (IN) with members of the bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) protein family (BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4). Introduction of the W390A mutation in MLV IN abolishes BET interaction. Here we compared the replication of W390A MLV and WT MLV in adult BALB/c mice to study the role of BET proteins in replication, integration and tumorigenesis in vivo. Comparing WT and W390A MLV infection revealed similar viral loads in blood, thymus and spleen cells. Interestingly, W390A MLV integration was retargeted away from GC-enriched genomic regions. However, both WT MLV and W390A MLV developed T cell lymphoma after a similar latency represented by an enlarged thymus and spleen and multi-organ tumor infiltration. Integration site sequencing from splenic tumor cells revealed clonal expansion in all WT MLV- and W390A MLV-infected mice. However, the integration profile of W390A MLV and WT MLV differed significantly. Integrations were enriched in enhancers and promoters but compared to WT, W390A MLV integrated less frequently into enhancers and more into oncogene bodies, such as Notch1 and Ppp1r16b. We conclude that host factors direct MLV in vivo integration site selection. Although, BET proteins target WT MLV integration preferentially towards enhancers and promoters, insertional lymphomagenesis can occur independently from BET, likely due to the intrinsically strong enhancer/promoter of the MLV LTR.",

    "abstract": "Cholestatic liver diseases are a major source of morbidity and mortality that can progress to end-stage liver disease. There are few effective medical therapies for primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and other cholestatic liver diseases, in part, due to our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury. The hepatic unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress that is important in the pathogenesis of many liver diseases and recent animal studies have demonstrated the importance of the UPR in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury. However, the role of the UPR in human cholestatic liver diseases is largely unknown. In this study, we utilized liver biopsies from patients after liver transplantation as a disease model to determine the transcriptional profile and hepatic UPR gene expression that is associated with liver injury and cholestasis. RNA-seq analysis revealed that patients with hyperbilirubinemia had enhanced expression of hepatic UPR pathways. Alternatively, liver biopsy samples from patients with acute rejection had enhanced gene expression of LAG3 and CDK1. Pearson correlation analysis of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin levels demonstrated significant correlations with the hepatic expression of several UPR genes, as well as genes involved in hepatic bile acid metabolism and inflammation. In contrast, serum alkaline phosphatase levels were correlated with the level of hepatic bile acid metabolism gene expression but not liver UPR gene expression.\n\nConclusionOverall, these data indicate that hepatic UPR pathways are increased in cholestatic human liver biopsy samples and supports an important role of the UPR in the mechanism of human cholestatic liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Technologies for detecting cell-cell contacts are powerful tools for studying a wide range of biological processes, from neuronal signaling to cancer-immune interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Here we report TRACC, a GPCR-based transcriptional recorder of cellular contacts, which converts contact events into stable transgene expression. TRACC is derived from our previous protein-protein interaction recorders, SPARK (Kim et al., 2017) and SPARK2 (Kim et al., 2019). TRACC incorporates light gating via the LOV domain, which provides user-defined temporal control of tool activation and reduces background. We show that TRACC detects cell-cell contacts with high specificity and sensitivity in mammalian cell culture and that it can be used to interrogate interactions between neurons and glioma, a form of brain cancer.",

    "abstract": "A 2 x 2 factorial experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of maternal supplementation from day 83 of gestation and/or direct supplementation from weaning of a bovine casein hydrolysate plus a yeast {beta}-glucan (CH-YBG) on pig performance and intestinal health on day ten post-weaning. Twenty cross bred gilts (Large White x Landrace) were randomly assigned to one of two dietary groups (n = 10 gilts/group): basal diet (basal sows) and basal diet supplemented with CH-YBG (supplemented sows) from day 83 of gestation until weaning (2g/sow/day). At weaning, 120 pigs (6 pigs/sow) were selected. The two dam groups were further divided, resulting in four experimental groups (10 replicates/group; 3 pigs/pen) as follows: 1) BB (basal sows + basal pigs); 2) BS (basal sows + supplemented pigs); 3) SB (supplemented sows + basal pigs); 4) SS (supplemented sows + supplemented pigs). Supplemented pigs were offered 0.5g CH-YBG/kg of feed for 10 days post-weaning. On day 10 post-weaning, 1 pig/pen was humanely sacrificed and samples were taken from the gastrointestinal tract for analysis. Pigs weaned from supplemented sows (SS, SB) had reduced faecal scores and incidence of diarrhoea (P<0.05) compared to pigs weaned from basal sows (BB, BS), with SS pigs not displaying the transient rise in faecal scores seen in the other three groups from day 3 to day 10 post-weaning (P<0.05). Pigs weaned from supplemented sows had reduced feed intake (P<0.05), improved feed efficiency (P<0.05), increased butyrate concentrations (P<0.05), increased abundance of Lactobacillus (P<0.05) and decreased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Campylobacteraceae (P<0.05) compared to pigs weaned from basal sows. In conclusion, a combination of both maternal and direct supplementation with CH-YBG is the desirable feeding strategy to ameliorate the post-weaning challenge in pig production systems.",

    "abstract": "Humans are unique among apes and other primates in the musculoskeletal design of their lower back, pelvis and lower limbs. Here, we describe the three-dimensional ground reaction forces and lower/hind limb joint mechanics of human and bipedal chimpanzee walking over a full stride and test whether: 1) the estimated limb joint work and power during stance phase, especially the single-support period, is lower in humans than bipedal chimpanzees, 2) the limb joint work and power required for limb swing is lower in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees, and 3) the estimated total mechanical power during walking, accounting for the storage of passive elastic strain energy in humans, is lower in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees. Humans and bipedal chimpanzees were compared at matched dimensionless and dimensional velocities. Our results indicate that humans walk with significantly less work and power output in the first double-support period and the single-support period of stance, but markedly exceed chimpanzees in the second-double support period (i.e., push-off). Humans generate less work and power in limb swing, although the species difference in limb swing power was not statistically significant. We estimated that total mechanical positive  muscle fiber work and power were 46.9% and 35.8% lower, respectively, in humans than bipedal chimpanzees at matched dimensionless speeds. This is due in part to mechanisms for the storage and release of elastic energy at the ankle and hip in humans. Further, these results indicate distinct heel strike and lateral balance mechanics in humans and bipedal chimpanzees, and suggest a greater dissipation of mechanical energy through soft tissue deformations in humans. Together, our results document important differences between human and bipedal chimpanzee walking mechanics over a full stride, permitting a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanics and energetics of chimpanzee bipedalism and the evolution of hominin walking.",

The St locus on chromosome 2 has been described as a major locus associated with suture strings. However, the gene and genetic basis underlying this locus remain unknown. Here, we investigated the suture strings of 138 snap bean accessions across two years. A total of 3.66 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained by deep resequencing. Based on these SNPs, we identified a strong association signal on Chr02 and a promising candidate gene, PvGUX1_1. Further analysis revealed that the 2-bp deletion in exon of PvGUX1_1 was significantly associated with stringlessness. Comparative mapping indicated that PvGUX1_1 was a domesticated locus and diverged from PvGUX1_2 during an early stage. Our study provides important insights into the genetic mechanism of suture string formation and useful information for snap bean improvement.",

    "abstract": "Rapid classification and tracking of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are critical for understanding the transmission dynamics and developing strategies for interrupting the transmission chain. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an exceptional tool for whole-genome analysis and deciphering new mutations. The technique has been instrumental in identifying the Variants of Concern and tracking this pandemic. However, NGS remains expensive and time-consuming for large-scale monitoring of COVID-19. This study analyzed a total of 78 de-identified samples that screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 from two timeframes, August 2020 and July 2021. All 78 samples were classified into WHO lineages by whole genome sequencing then compared with two commercially available Q-PCR assays for spike protein mutation(s). The data showed good concordance with Q-PCR and NGS analysis for specific SARS-COV-2 lineages and characteristic mutations.\n\nDeployment of Q-PCR testing to detect known SARS-COV-2 variants may be extremely beneficial. These assays are quick and cost-effective, thus can be implemented as an alternative to sequencing for screening known mutations of SARS-COV-2 for clinical and epidemiological interest. The findings support the great potential for Q-PCR to be an effective strategy offering several COVID-19 epidemiological advantages.",

    "abstract": "The chemolithotroph Cupriavidus necator H16 is known as a natural producer of the bioplastic-polymer PHB, as well as for its metabolic versatility to utilize different substrates, including formate as the sole carbon and energy source. Depending on the entry point of the substrate, this versatility requires adjustment of the thermodynamic landscape to maintain sufficiently high driving forces for biological processes. Here we employed a model of the core metabolism of C. necator H16 to analyze the thermodynamic driving forces and PHB yields of different metabolic engineering strategies. For this, we enumerated elementary flux modes (EFMs) of the network and evaluated their PHB yields as well as thermodynamics via Max-min driving force (MDF) analysis and random sampling of driving forces. A heterologous ATP:citrate lyase reaction was predicted to increase driving force for producing acetyl-CoA. A heterologous phosphoketolase reaction was predicted to increase maximal PHB yields as well as driving forces. These enzymes were verified experimentally to enhance PHB titers between 60 and 300% in select conditions. The EFM analysis also revealed that metabolic strategies for PHB production from formate may be limited by low driving forces through citrate lyase and aconitase, as well as cofactor balancing, and identified reactions of the core metabolism associated with low and high PHB yield. The findings of this study aid in understanding metabolic adaptation. Furthemore, the outlined approach will be useful in designing metabolic engineering strategies in other non-model bacteria.\n\nHighlightsO_LIElementary flux modes of C. necator for PHB synthesis from fructose and formate.\nC_LIO_LIMetabolite sampling identified common reactions among EFMs with low driving force.\nC_LIO_LIPHB from formate shows low driving forces for aconitase, citrate lyase, NADPH synthesis.\nC_LIO_LIPhosphoketolase and ATP citrate lyase increased driving forces and PHB production.\nC_LI",

Using sodium (polystyrene sulfonate) as the guest macromolecule and the ideal tetra-PEG gel, we find the emergence of the non-diffusive topologically frustrated dynamical state with a hierarchy of segmental dynamics represented by a stretched exponential of exponent {beta} around 1/3.

    "abstract": "Among the five known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, Delta is the most virulent leading to severe symptoms and increased number of deaths. Our study seeks to examine how the biophysical parameters of the Delta variant correlate to the clinical observations. Receptor binding domain (RBD) is the first point of contact with the human host cells and is the immunodominant form of the spike protein. Delta variant RBD contains two novel mutations L452R and T478K. We examined the effect of single mutations as well as the double mutation on RBD expression in human Expi293 cells, RBD stability using urea and thermal denaturation, and RBD binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to neutralizing antibodies using isothermal titration calorimetry. Delta variant RBD showed significantly higher expression compared to the wild-type RBD, and the increased expression is due to L452R mutation. Despite their non-conservative nature, none of the mutations significantly affected RBD structure and stability. All mutants showed similar binding affinity to ACE2 and to Class 1 antibodies (CC12.1 and LY-CoV016) as that of the wild-type. Delta double mutant L452R/T478K showed no binding to Class 2 antibodies (P2B-2F6 and LY-CoV555) and a hundred-fold weaker binding to a Class 3 antibody (REGN10987), and the decreased antibody binding is determined by the L452R mutation. These results indicate that the immune escape from neutralizing antibodies, rather than receptor binding, is the main biophysical parameter determining the fitness landscape of the Delta variant RBD and is determined by the L452R mutation.",

    "abstract": "Despite its pivotal roles in biology, how the transcriptional activity of c-MYC is attuned quantitatively remain poorly defined. Here, we show that heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master transcriptional regulator of the heat-shock, or proteotoxic stress, response, acts as a key modifier of the c-MYC-mediated transcription. HSF1 deficiency diminishes c-MYC DNA binding and dampens its transcriptional activity genome-widely. Mechanistically, c-MYC, MAX, and HSF1 assemble into a transcription factor complex on genomic DNAs and, surprisingly, the DNA binding of HSF1 is dispensable. Instead, HSF1 physically recruits the histone acetyltransferase GCN5, thereby promoting histone acetylation and augmenting c-MYC transcriptional activity. Thus, our studies reveal that HSF1 specifically potentiates the c-MYC-mediated transcription, distinct from its role in the canonical heat-shock response. Importantly, this mechanism of action engenders two distinct c-MYC activation states, primary and advanced, which may be important to accommodate diverse physiological and pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "The ability to reliably predict and infer cellular responses to environmental exposures would offer a major advance in the investigation of immune regulation in health and disease. One possible approach is the use of in silico modelling. Design of such a mathematical kinetic model would be based on existing knowledge of a biological system and utilise a partial data set to parameterise. However, the process of parameter estimation, key for the accuracy of the model, is difficult to conduct by hand, and thus a computational alternative is necessary. We report the utility of Genetic Algorithm with Rank Selection (GARS) as a parameter estimation tool on multiple biological models, including heat shock, signal transduction via ERK, circadian rhythm and NF{kappa}B systems, where it showed strong accuracy and superiority to the Extended Kalman Filter method, Algebraic Difference Equations, and MATLAB fminsearch approaches. GARS parameter estimation is a valuable tool for biological data because it reliably infers system behaviour from partial data sets, allowing for the prediction of cellular responses to environmental exposures.",
