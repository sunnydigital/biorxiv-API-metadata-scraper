    "abstract": "Directed evolution uses cycles of gene diversification and selection to generate proteins with novel properties. While traditionally directed evolution is performed in prokaryotic systems, recently a mammalian directed evolution system (viral evolution of genetically actuating sequences, or \"VEGAS\") has been described. Here we report that the VEGAS system has major limitations precluding its use for directed evolution. The primary technical issue with the VEGAS system is an immediate contamination with \"cheater\" particles that bypass directed evolution circuits. By sequencing we find these cheater particles contain Sindbis structural genes instead of the intended directed evolution target transgene. These cheaters outcompete the VEGAS transgenes within 2 rounds of transduction but cannot themselves activate synthetic circuits that drive expression of Sindbis structural genes, preventing directed evolution campaigns. Similar results have been obtained in independent labs. Taken together, the VEGAS system does not work as described and, without significant redesign to suppress cheaters, cannot be used for mammalian directed evolution campaigns.",

    "abstract": "Living cells perform sophisticated computations that guide them toward discrete states. Synthetic genetic circuits are powerful tools for programing these computations, where transcription-regulatory networks and DNA recombination are the two dominant paradigms for implementing these systems. While each strategy exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses, integrating both into one seamless design framework would enable advanced gene circuit designs intractable with either approach alone. Here, we present Computation via Recombinase Assisted Transcriptional Effectors (CREATE), which leverages site-specific recombination to perform robust logic on discreet computational layers and programmable transcription factors that connect these layers, allowing individual calculations to contribute toward larger operations. We demonstrate the functionality of CREATE by producing sophisticated circuits using a simple plug- and-play framework, including 189 2-input-3-output circuits, modular digital-to-analog signal converters, a 2-bit multiplier circuit, and a digital and analog mixed-signal generator. This work establishes CREATE as a versatile platform for programming complex signal processing systems capable of high-fidelity logic computation and tunable control over circuit output levels.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWe present a minimal and robust genetic circuit platform for programming cells with sophisticated signal processing capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous intracellular protozoan parasite that establishes a life-long chronic infection largely restricted to the central nervous system (CNS). Constant immune pressure, notably IFN-{gamma}-STAT1 signaling, is required for preventing fatal pathology during T. gondii infection. Here, we report that abrogation of STAT1 signaling in microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, is sufficient to induce a loss of parasite control in the CNS and susceptibility to toxoplasmic encephalitis during the early stages of chronic infection. Using a microglia-specific genetic labeling and targeting system that discriminates microglia from blood-derived myeloid cells that infiltrate the brain during infection, we find that, contrary to previous in vitro reports, microglia do not express inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) during T. gondii infection in vivo. Instead, transcriptomic analyses of microglia reveal that STAT1 regulates both (i) a transcriptional shift from homeostatic to \"disease-associated microglia\" (DAM) phenotype conserved across several neuroinflammatory models, including T. gondii infection, and (ii) the expression of anti-parasitic cytosolic molecules that are required for eliminating T. gondii in a cell-intrinsic manner. Further, genetic deletion of Stat1 from microglia during T. gondii challenge leads to fatal pathology despite largely equivalent or enhanced immune effector functions displayed by brain-infiltrating immune populations. Finally, we show that microglial STAT1-deficiency results in the overrepresentation of the highly replicative, lytic tachyzoite form of T. gondii, relative to its quiescent, semi-dormant bradyzoite form typical of chronic CNS infection. Our data suggest an overall protective role of CNS-resident microglia against T. gondii infection, illuminating (i) general mechanisms of CNS-specific immunity to infection (ii) and a clear role for IFN-STAT1 signaling in regulating a microglial activation phenotype observed across diverse neuroinflammatory disease states.",

    "abstract": "CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein), encoded by crp, is a global regulator that is activated by cAMP (cyclic AMP), a second messenger synthesized by a class I adenylate cyclase (AC-I) encoded by cyaA in Escherichia coli. cAMP-CRP is required for growth on non-preferred carbon sources and is a global regulator. We constructed in-frame non- polar deletions of the crp and cyaA homologs in Vibrio parahaemolyticus and found that the {Delta}crp mutant did not grow in minimal media supplemented with non-preferred carbon sources, but the {Delta}cyaA mutant grew similar to wild type. Bioinformatics analysis of the V. parahaemolyticus genome identified a 181 amino acid protein annotated as a class IV adenylate cyclase (AC-IV) named CyaB, a member of the CYTH protein superfamily. AC-IV phylogeny showed CyaB was present in Gamma- and Alpha- Proteobacteria as well as Planctomycete and Archaea. Only the bacterial CyaB proteins contained an N-terminal motif HFxxxExExK indicative of adenylyl cyclase activity. Both V. parahaemolyticus cyaA and cyaB genes functionally complemented an E. coli {Delta}cyaA mutant. The {Delta}crp and {Delta}cyaB/{Delta}cyaA mutants showed defects in growth on non- preferred carbon sources, and in swimming and swarming motility, indicating cAMP- CRP is an activator. The {Delta}cyaA and {Delta}cyaB single mutants had no defects in these phenotypes indicating AC-IV complements AC-I. Capsule polysaccharide and biofilm production assays showed significant defects in {Delta}crp, {Delta}cyaB/{Delta}cyaA, and the {Delta}cyaB mutant, whereas {Delta}cyaA behaved similar to wild type. This is consistent with a role of cAMP-CRP as an activator of these phenotypes and establishes a cellular role for AC-IV in capsule and biofilm formation, which to date has been unestablished.\n\nIMPORTANCEHere, we characterized the roles of CRP and CyaA in V. parahaemolyticus, showing cAMP-CRP was an activator of metabolism, motility, capsule and biofilm formation. These results are in contrast to cAMP-CRP in V. cholerae, which represses capsule and biofilm formation. Previously, only an AC-I CyaA had been identified in Vibrio species. Our data showed that an AC-IV CyaB homolog is present in V. parahaemolyticus and was required for optimal growth. The data demonstrated that CyaB was essential for capsule production and biofilm formation uncovering a physiological role of AC-IV in bacteria. The data showed that the cyaB gene was widespread among Vibrionaceae species and several other Gamma-Proteobacteria, but in general, its phylogenetic distribution was limited. Our phylogenetic analysis also demonstrated that in some species the cyaB gene was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "Mold growth in HVAC systems poses a threat to human health, increases facility management operating costs due to decreased air flow efficiency, and damages buildings, impacting buildings attractiveness in an ever more competitive property market concerned with both carbon footprint and ventilation quality. Although UVC treatment of HVAC systems has been shown to reduce growth, efficient design requires a specified amount of UVC dose coupled with a specific dosing strategy. UVC disinfection efficacy and wavelength sensitivity of spores from the most common and notorious black mold, Cladosporium halotolerans is not known. This study investigates the sensitivity of C. halotolerans and demonstrates that growth of black mold on HVAC coils can be effectively prevented with a periodic dosing scheme using commercially available UVC LEDs. Multiple UVC LED arrays with varying wavelength peaks in the range of 252-280 nm were used to demonstrate the spectral sensitivity of C. halotolerans by keeping the wavelength specific UVC dose equal in order to avoid bias. The data obtained for doses of 25, 75, 125, 175, and 225 mJ/cm2 was used. The data obtained was used to determine a dose response curve and susceptibility patterns. Disinfection performances for the arrays were determined using log reduction value (LRV) by comparing the controls against the irradiated treatments. To study mold growth prevention on HVAC coils, the 267 nm array which had the best disinfection efficacy was utilized. The coils were placed in a chamber with a temperature set at 24 {degrees}C and relative humidity (RH) at 96%. Unlike the controls, the test coil was irradiated with a dose of 28.8 mJ/cm2 every 12 hours. The coils were monitored, and observations were recorded using time-lapse videos. The highest disinfection level of black mold observed in the range of 250-280nm occurred at 267 nm, with 225 mJ/cm2 obtaining 4.03 LRV. Linear regression analysis at 95% for 252 nm (R2 =0.9637, p=0.0030), 261 nm (R2 =0.9711, p=0.0021), 267 nm (R2 =0.9723, p=0.0020), 270 nm (R2 =0.9819, p=0.0010), 273 nm (R2 =0.9878, p=0.0006), and 280 nm (R2 =0.9914, p=0.0003) displayed significant association between arrays peak wavelengths and disinfection performances against C. halotolerans. The study revealed that a higher dose of 225 mJ/cm2 is required to disinfect C. halotolerans by 99.99% (4.03 LRV). However, using a periodic dosing strategy utilizing 28.8 mJ/cm2 prevented any mold growth, while the fungal levels in the positive control increased. The study allows for the design and implementation of mold growth prevention strategies in HVAC systems to improve health and lower operating costs.",

The Tetrahymena thermophila protein Mlp1 has been classified as a genuine La protein, despite the predicted absence of the RRM1. We found that Mlp1 functions as a La protein through binding of pre-tRNAs and affecting processing in Tetrahymena thermophila and when expressed in fission yeast. However, unlike in other examined eukaryotes, depletion of Mlp1 results in 3-trailer stabilization. We also observed that 3-trailers in Tetrahymena thermophila are uniquely short relative to other examined eukaryotes, and that 5-leaders have evolved to disfavour pre-tRNA leader/trailer pairing. Our data indicate that this variant Mlp1 architecture is linked to an altered, novel mechanism of tRNA processing in Tetrahymena thermophila.",

    "abstract": "The posttranslational modification lysine malonylation is found in many proteins, including histones. However, it remains unclear whether histone malonylation is regulated or functionally relevant. Here, we report that availability of malonyl-co-enzyme A (malonyl-CoA), an endogenous provider of malonyl groups, affects lysine malonylation, and that the deacylase SIRT5 selectively reduces malonylation of histones. To determine if histone malonylation is enzymatically catalyzed, we knocked down each of the 22 lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) to test their malonyltransferase potential. KAT2A knockdown in particular reduced histone malonylation levels. By mass spectrometry, H2B_K5 was highly malonylated and significantly regulated by SIRT5 in mouse brain and liver. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the malonyl-CoA producing enzyme, was partly localized in the nucleolus, and histone malonylation increased nucleolar area and ribosomal RNA expression. Levels of global lysine malonylation and ACC expression were higher in older mouse brains than younger mice. These experiments highlight the role of histone malonylation in ribosomal gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Surface-associated microbial communities are omnipresent on Earth. As individuals grow and divide within these communities, they undergo range expansion during which different cell-types arrange themselves across space to form spatial patterns (referred to as spatial self-organization). Metabolic interactions are important determinants of the spatial self-organization process, where they direct the spatial positionings of different cell-types. We hypothesized here a previously unexplored consequence of metabolic interactions; by directing the spatial positionings of different cell-types, they also control the horizontal spread of functional novelty during range expansion. We focused on a form of functional novelty of critical importance to human health - the conjugative transfer and proliferation of plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance. We performed range expansion experiments and spatially-explicit individual-based computational simulations with pairs of strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri, where one strain was a plasmid donor and the other a potential recipient. We then imposed a competitive or resource cross-feeding interaction between them. We found that interactions that increase the spatial intermixing of strains also increase plasmid conjugation. We further directly linked these effects to spatial intermixing itself. We finally showed that the ability of plasmid recipients to proliferate is determined by their spatial positionings. Our results demonstrate that metabolic interactions are indeed important determinants of the horizontal spread of functional novelty during microbial range expansion, and that the spatial positionings of different cell-types need to be considered when predicting the proliferation and fate of plasmid-encoded traits.",

    "abstract": "Crop wild relatives represent valuable sources of alleles for crop improvement, including adaptation to climate change and emerging diseases. However, introgressions from wild relatives might have deleterious effects on desirable traits, including yield, due to linkage drag. Here we comprehensively analyzed the genomic and phenotypic impacts of wild introgressions into cultivated sunflower to estimate the impacts of linkage drag. First, we generated new reference sequences for seven cultivated and one wild sunflower genotype, as well as improved assemblies for two additional cultivars. Next, relying on previously generated sequences from wild donor species, we identified introgressions in the cultivated reference sequences, as well as the sequence and structural variants they contain. We then used a ridge regression model to test the effects of the introgressions on phenotypic traits in the cultivated sunflower association mapping population. We found that introgression has introduced substantial sequence and structural variation into the cultivated sunflower gene pool, including > 3,000 new genes. While introgressions reduced genetic load at protein-coding sequences and positively affected traits associated with abiotic stress resistance, they mostly had negative impacts on yield and quality traits. Introgressions found at high frequency in the cultivated gene pool had larger effects than low frequency introgressions, suggesting that the former likely were targeted by artificial selection. Also, introgressions from more distantly related species were more likely to be maladaptive than those from the wild progenitor of cultivated sunflower. Thus, pre-breeding efforts should focus, as far as possible, on closely related and fully compatible wild relatives.",

AP sites are reactive and form crosslinks to both proteins and DNA, are prone to strand breakage, and inhibit DNA replication and transcription. The protein HMCES protects cells from strand breaks, inhibits mutagenic translesion synthesis, and participates in repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks derived from AP sites by forming a stable thiazolidine DNA-protein crosslink (DPC) to AP sites in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Despite the importance of HMCES to genome maintenance and the evolutionary conservation of its catalytic SRAP (SOS Response Associated Peptidase) domain, the enzymatic mechanisms of DPC formation and resolution are unknown. Using the bacterial homolog YedK, we show that the SRAP domain catalyzes conversion of the AP site to its reactive, ring-opened aldehyde form, and provide structural evidence for the Schiff base intermediate that forms prior to the more stable thiazolidine. We also report two new activities, whereby SRAP reacts with polyunsaturated aldehydes at DNA 3-ends generated by bifunctional DNA glycosylases and catalyzes direct reversal of the DPC to regenerate the AP site, which provide insight into possible mechanisms by which HMCES DPCs are resolved in cells.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 technology is an important tool for functional genomics and crop improvement. It can be used to generate mutations at precise positions in the genome. Base editors consist of deaminase components and Cas9 to specify the type of mutation, such as C-to-T (cytosine base editors) or A-to-G (adenine base editors) transition. Available adenine base editor vectors usually make use of canonical Cas9, which limits their use to 5-NGG-3 containing targets. We combined a relaxed variant of SpCas9 that uses 5-NG-3 containing targets with the adenine base editor containing TadA7.10 or TadA8e to make a set of vectors. By using a phenotype-based screen, we found that our vectors efficiently induce A-to-G somatic mutations in a 5-NGG-3 PAM context in Arabidopsis thaliana up to 81% efficiency. Such mutations are inheritable at the homozygous stage in T2. Among tested vectors, pECNUS4 (Addgene #184887), which carries TadA8e, showed highest efficiency at generating a stable A-to-G transition in a 5-NGH-3 PAM context in the gene DM3. Using this vector, we were able to recreate a naturally occurring allele of DM3 in two generations without the transgene. pECNUS4 is a new component of the CRISPR toolbox to be used for introducing desired adenine base transitions with an expanded target window for functional genomic research and trait improvement.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as the most efficient genome editing technology for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Recently, biologist have started using CRISPR/Cas9 as a defence machinery in plants against DNA viruses by targeting conserve regions of their genome. Considerable resistance requires formation of stable transgenic lines with multiple gRNAs, targeting specific viruses. Development of such transgenic plants is not only time consuming but also there will always be some uncertainty of their efficiency and off targets in plant genome. Newly discovered miniature CRISPR/Cas12f (Cas14a) system has unique ability to chop down every ssDNA fragment once activated through targeted cleavage. Here we report first fully functional transient CRISPR/Cas12f system in plants. We also show that Cas12f with just one gRNA is enough for substantial broad-spectrum resistance against Gemini viruses. Plant phenotype showed nearly complete recovery and qPCR results showed multifold decrease infection of CLCuV in CRISPR/Cas12f treated plants compare to the infected plants (infected with CLCuMuV and CLCuKV). Smaller size, broad range and more efficiency make Cas12f a superior alternative of Cas9 against diverse group of ssDNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "Morphological scaling relationships between the sizes of individual traits and the body captures the characteristic shape of a species, and the evolution of scaling is the primary mechanism of morphological diversification. However, we have almost no knowledge of the genetic architecture of scaling, critical if we are to understand how scaling evolves. Here we explore the genetic architecture of population-level morphological scaling relationships - the scaling relationship fit to multiple genetically-distinct individuals in a population - by describing the distribution of individual scaling relationships - genotype-specific scaling relationships that are unseen or cryptic. These individual scaling relationships harbor the genetic variation that determines relative trait growth within individuals, and theoretical studies suggest that their distribution dictates how the population scaling relationship will respond to selection. Using variation in nutrition to generate size variation within 197 isogenic lineages of Drosophila melanogaster, we reveal extensive variation in the slopes of the wing-body and leg-body scaling relationships among individual genotypes. This genetic variation reflects variation in the nutritionally-induced size plasticity of the wing, leg and body. Surprisingly, we find that variation in the slope of individual scaling relationships primarily results from variation in nutritionally-induced plasticity of body size, not leg or wing size. These data allow us to predict how different selection regimes alter scaling in Drosophila and is the first step in identifying the genetic targets of such selection. More generally, our approach provides a framework for understanding the genetic architecture of scaling, an important prerequisite to explaining how selection changes scaling and morphology.",

    "abstract": "Sex Ratio chromosomes in Drosophila pseudoobscura are selfish X chromosome variants associated with three non-overlapping inversions. In the male germline, Sex Ratio chromosomes distort segregation of X and Y chromosomes (99:1), thereby skewing progeny sex ratio. In the female germline, segregation of Sex Ratio chromosomes is mendelian (50:50), but non-overlapping inversions strongly suppress recombination establishing a 26 Megabase haplotype (constituting ~20% of the haploid genome). Rare crossover events located between non-overlapping inversions can disrupt this haplotype, and recombinants have sometimes been found in natural populations. We recently reported on the first lab-generated Sex Ratio recombinants occurring at a rate of 0.0012 crossovers per female meiosis. An improved experimental design presented here reveals these recombination events were 6.5-fold more frequent than previously estimated. Furthermore, recombination events were strongly clustered, indicating the majority arose from mitotic exchange in female germline stem cells and not from meiotic crossing-over in primary oocytes. Finally, recombination-induced viability defects consistent with unequal exchange caused asymmetric recovery rates of complementary recombinant classes. Incorporating these experimental results into population models for Sex Ratio chromosome evolution provided a substantially better fit to natural population frequencies and allowed maintenance of the highly differentiated 26 Megabase Sex Ratio haplotype without invoking strong epistatic selection. This study provides the first estimate of spontaneous mitotic exchange for naturally-occurring chromosomes in Drosophila female germline stem cells, reveals a much higher Sex Ratio chromosome recombination rate, and develops a mathematical model that accurately predicts the rarity of recombinant Sex Ratio chromosomes in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMetabolic dysfunction and cancer cachexia are associated with poor cancer prognosis, yet the molecular mechanisms causing cancer-induced metabolic dysfunction and cachexia remain to be defined. A key link between metabolic- and muscle mass-regulation is adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). As AMPK could be a potential treatment, it is important to determine the function for AMPK in cancer-associated metabolic dysfunction and cachexia. Here we determined the function of AMPK in cancer-associated metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and cachexia.\n\nMethodsIn vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from pre-cachectic and cachectic patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC), AMPK signaling and expression were examined by immunoblotting. To investigate the role of muscle AMPK, male mice overexpressing a dominant-negative AMPK2 (kinase-dead) specifically in striated muscle (mAMPK-KD) were inoculated with Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells. In a subsequent cohort, male LLC-tumor-bearing mice were treated with/without 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) to activate AMPK for 13 days. Littermate mice were used as control. Metabolic phenotyping of mice was performed via indirect calorimetry, body composition analyses, glucose- and insulin tolerance tests, tissue-specific 2-deoxy- glucose (2-DG) uptake, and immunoblotting.\n\nResultsIn muscle from patients with NSCLC, we found increased expression of AMPK subunits 1, 2, {beta}2, {gamma}1, and {gamma}3; ranging from +27% to +79% compared to healthy control subjects. AMPK subunit expression correlated with indices of cachexia, including cross sectional area and weight loss. Tumor-bearing mAMPK-KD mice presented increased fat loss as well as glucose and insulin intolerance. LLC in mAMPK-KD mice displayed lower insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake in skeletal muscle (quadriceps; -35%, soleus; -49%, EDL; -48%) and the heart (-29%) compared to non-tumor-bearing mice. In skeletal muscle, mAMPK-KD abrogated the tumor-induced increase in phosphorylation of TBC1D4thr642. Additionally, protein expression of TBC1D4 (+26%), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH, +94%), and PDH-kinases (PDKs, +45% to +100%), and glycogen synthase (+48%) were increased in skeletal muscle of tumor-bearing mice in an AMPK-dependent manner. Lastly, chronic AICAR treatment elevated hexokinase-II protein expression and normalized phosphorylation of p70S6Kthr389 (mTORC1 substrate) and ACCser212 (AMPK substrate) and rescued the cancer-induced insulin intolerance.\n\nConclusionsUpregulated protein expression of AMPK subunits observed in skeletal muscle of (pre)cachectic patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma. This seemed protective inferred by AMPK-deficient tumor-bearing mice being highly prone to developing metabolic dysfunction, which included the AMPK-dependent regulation of several proteins involved in glucose metabolism. These observations highlight the potential for targeting AMPK to counter cancer-associated metabolic dysfunction and cachexia.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/495096v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7ff169org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c249aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@736350org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17d2be2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
