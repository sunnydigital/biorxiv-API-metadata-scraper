    "abstract": "There has been a substantial rise in e-cigarette (e-cig) use or vaping in the past decade, prompting growing concerns about their adverse health effects. Recently, e-cig manufacturers have been using synthetic cooling agents, like WS-23 and WS-3, to provide a cooling sensation without the \"menthol taste\". Studies have shown that aerosols/vapes generated by e-cigs can contain significant levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, studies investigating the role of synthetic coolants in modulating ROS levels generated by e-cigs are lacking. This study seeks to understand the potential of synthetic coolants, e-cigarette additives that have become increasingly prevalent in e-liquids sold in the United States (US), on acellular ROS production. Aerosols were generated from e-liquids with and without synthetic coolants through a single-puff aerosol generator; subsequently, acellular ROS was semi-quantified in H2O2 equivalents via fluorescence spectroscopy. Our data suggest that adding WS-3 to e-liquid base (PG:VG), regardless of nicotine content, has a minimal impact on modifying e-cigarette-generated acellular ROS levels. Additionally, our data also suggest that the addition of WS-23 to nicotine-containing e-liquid base significantly modifies e-cigarette-generated acellular ROS levels. Together, our data provide insight into whether adding synthetic coolants to e-liquids significantly impacts vaping-induced oxidative stress in the lungs.",

    "abstract": "The reliable identification of chronic cardiotoxic effects in in vitro screenings is fundamental for filtering out toxic molecular entities before in vivo animal experimentation and clinical trials. Present techniques such as patch-clamp, voltage indicators, and standard microelectrode arrays do not offer at the same time high sensitivity for measuring transmembrane ion currents and low-invasiveness for monitoring cells over long time. Here, we show that optoporation applied to microelectrode arrays enables measuring action potentials from human-derived cardiac syncytia for more than 1 continuous month and provides reliable data on chronic cardiotoxic effects caused by known compounds such as pentamidine. The technique has high potential for detecting chronic cardiotoxicity in the early phases of drug development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe use of palm oil for our current needs is unsustainable. Replacing palm oil with oils produced by microbes through the conversion of sustainable feedstocks is a promising alternative. However, there are major technical challenges that must be overcome to enable this transition. Foremost among these challenges is the stark increase in lipid accumulation and production of higher content of specific fatty acids. Therefore, there is a need for more in-depth knowledge and systematic exploration of the oil productivity of the oleaginous yeasts. In this study, we cultivated Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus and Yarrowia lipolytica at various C/N ratios and temperatures in a defined medium with glycerol as carbon source and urea as nitrogen source. We ascertained the synergistic effect between various C/N ratios of a defined medium at different temperatures with Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and explored the variation in fatty acid composition through Principal Component Analysis.\n\nResultsBy applying RSM, we determined a temperature of 30 {degrees}C and a C/N ratio of 175 g/g to enable maximal oil production by C. oleaginosus and a temperature of 21 {degrees}C and a C/N ratio of 140 g/g for Y. lipolytica. We increased production by 71 % and 66 % respectively for each yeast compared to the average lipid accumulation in all tested conditions. Modulating temperature enabled us to steer the fatty acid compositions. Accordingly, switching from higher temperature to lower cultivation temperature shifted the production of oils from more saturated to unsaturated by 14 % in C. oleaginosus and 31 % in Y. lipolytica. Higher cultivation temperatures resulted in production of even longer saturated fatty acids, 3 % in C. oleaginosus and 1.5 % in Y. lipolytica.\n\nConclusionsIn this study, we provided the optimum C/N ratio and temperature for C. oleaginosus and Y. lipolytica by RSM. Additionally, we demonstrated that lipid accumulation of both oleaginous yeasts was significantly affected by the C/N ratio and temperature. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the variation in fatty acids composition and proved that changing the C/N ratio and temperature steer the composition. We have further established these oleaginous yeasts as platforms for production of tailored fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages show high plasticity and result in heterogenic subpopulations or polarized states identified by specific cellular markers. These immune cells are typically characterized as pro-inflammatory, or classically activated M1, and anti-inflammatory, or alternatively activated M2. However, a more precise definition places them along a spectrum of activation where they may exhibit a number of pro- or anti-inflammatory roles. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response from macrophages and the balance between M1 and M2 activation, we utilized two different modeling techniques, ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling and agent-based modeling (ABM), to simulate the spectrum of macrophage activation to general pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli on an individual and multi-cell level. The ODE model includes two hallmark pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways and the ABM incorporates similar M1-M2 dynamics but in a spatio-temporal platform. Both models link molecular signaling with cellular-level dynamics. We then performed simulations with various initial conditions to replicate different experimental setups. Similar results were observed in both models after tuning to a common calibrating experiment. Comparing the two models results sheds light on the important features of each modeling approach. When more data is available these features can be considered when choosing techniques to best fit the needs of the modeler and application.",

    "abstract": "(Macro)autophagy comprises a major lysosome-dependent degradation mechanism which engulfs, removes and recycles unwanted cytoplasmic material, including damaged organelles and toxic protein aggregates. Although a few studies implicate autophagy in CNS demyelinating pathologies, its role, particularly in mature oligodendrocytes and CNS myelin, remains poorly studied. Here, using both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the autophagic machinery, we provide evidence that autophagy is an essential mechanism for oligodendrocyte maturation in vitro. Our study reveals that two core myelin proteins, namely proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) are incorporated into autophagosomes in oligodendrocytes, resulting in their degradation. Furthermore, we ablated atg5, a core gene of the autophagic machinery, specifically in myelinating glial cells in vivo by tamoxifen administration (plp-CreERT2; atg5F/F) and showed that myelin maintenance is perturbed, leading to PLP accumulation. Significant morphological defects in myelin membrane such as decompaction accompanied with increased axonal degeneration are observed. As a result, the mice exhibit behavioral deficits. In summary, our data highlight that the maintenance of adult myelin homeostasis in the CNS requires the involvement of a fully functional autophagic machinery.",

    "abstract": "Lateralized processing of orthographic information is a hallmark of proficient reading. However, how this finding obtained for fixed-gaze processing of orthographic stimuli translates to ecologically valid reading conditions remained to be clarified. To address this shortcoming, here we assessed the lateralization of early orthographic processing in fixed-gaze and natural reading conditions using concomitant eye-tracking and EEG data recorded from young adults without reading difficulties. Sensor-space analyses confirmed the well-known left-lateralized negative-going deflection of fixed-gaze EEG activity throughout the period of early orthographic processing. At the same time, fixation-related EEG activity exhibited left-lateralized followed by right-lateralized processing of text stimuli during natural reading. A strong positive relationship was found between the early leftward lateralization in fixed-gaze and natural reading conditions. Using source-space analyses, early left-lateralized brain activity was obtained in lateraloccipital and posterior ventral occipito-temporal cortices reflecting letter-level processing in both conditions. In addition, in the same time interval, left-lateralized source activity was found also in premotor and parietal brain regions during natural reading. While brain activity remained left-lateralized in later stages representing word-level processing in posterior and middle ventral temporal regions in the fixed-gaze condition, fixation-related source activity became stronger in the right hemisphere in medial and more anterior ventral temporal brain regions indicating higher-level processing of orthographic information. Although our results show a strong positive relationship between the lateralization of letter-level processing in the two conditions and suggest lateralized brain activity as a general marker for processing of orthographic information, they also clearly indicate the need for reading research in ecologically valid conditions to identify the neural basis of visuospatial attentional, oculomotor and higher-level processes specific for natural reading.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, including memory deficits. This is particularly worrisome during adolescence, which represents a crucial period for maturation of brain structures, such as the hippocampus which are crucial for cognition. In rodent models, we recently reported that memory impairments induced by obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) intake during the periadolescent period can be reversed by chemogenetic manipulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Here, we used an intersectional viral approach in HFD-fed male mice to chemogenetically inactivate specific vHPC efferent pathways to nucleus accumbens or medial prefrontal cortex during memory tasks. We first demonstrated that HFD enhanced activation of both pathways after training and that our chemogenetic approach was effective in normalising this activation. Inactivation of the vHPC-nucleus accumbens pathway rescued HFD-induced deficits in recognition but not location memory. Conversely, inactivation of the vHPC-medial prefrontal cortex pathway restored location but not recognition memory impairments produced by HFD. Either pathway manipulation did not affect exploration, locomotion or anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that HFD intake throughout adolescence impairs different types of memory through overactivation of specific hippocampal efferent pathways and that targeting these overactive pathways has therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThere are limited treatment options for female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) has shown improvements in FSD symptoms in neuromodulation clinical studies, but the direct effects on sexual function are not understood. This study evaluated the immediate and long-term effects of PTNS on sexual motivation and receptivity in a rat model of menopausal women. Our primary hypothesis was that long-term PTNS would yield greater changes in sexual behavior than short-term stimulation.\n\nMaterials and MethodsIn two Experiments, after receiving treatment, we placed ovariectomized female rats in an operant chamber in which the female controls access to a male by nose poking. We used five treatment conditions, which were with or without PTNS and no, partial, or full hormone priming. In Experiment 1, we rotated rats through each condition twice with behavioral testing immediately following treatment for 10 weeks. In Experiment 2, we committed rats to one condition for 6 weeks and tracked sexual behavior over time. We quantified sexual motivation and sexual receptivity with standard measures.\n\nResultsNo primary comparisons were significant in this study. In Experiment 1, we observed increased sexual motivation but not receptivity immediately following PTNS with partial hormone priming, as compared to priming without PTNS. In Experiment 2, we observed trends of increased sexual receptivity and some sexual motivation metrics when PTNS was applied long-term with partial hormone priming, as compared to hormone-primed rats without stimulation.\n\nConclusionsPTNS combined with hormone priming shows potential for increasing sexual motivation in the short-term and sexual receptivity in the long-term in rats. Further studies are needed to examine variability in rat behavior and to investigate PTNS as a treatment for FSD in menopausal women.",

    "abstract": "In vitro systems mimicking brain regions, brain organoids, are revolutionizing the neuroscience field. However, characterization of their electrical activity has remained a challenge as this requires readout at millisecond timescale in 3D at single-neuron resolution. While custom-built microscopes used with genetically encoded sensors are now opening this door, a full 3D characterization of organoid neural activity has not been performed yet, limited by the combined complexity of the optical and the biological system. Here, we introduce an accessible minimalistic light-sheet microscope to the neuroscience community. Designed as an add-on to a standard inverted microscope it can be assembled within one day. In contrast to existing simplistic setups, our platform is suited to record volumetric calcium traces. We successfully extracted 4D calcium traces at high temporal resolution by using a lightweight piezo stage to allow for 5Hz volumetric scanning combined with a processing pipeline for true 3D neuronal trace segmentation. As a proof of principle, we created a 3D connectivity map of a stem cell derived neuron spheroid by imaging its activity. Our fast, low complexity setup empowers researchers to study the formation of neuronal networks in vitro for fundamental and neurodegeneration research.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysical methods are widely used in neuroscience to investigate the quantitative relation between a physical property of the world and its perceptual representation provided by the senses. Recent studies introduced the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to fit the responses of multiple participants in psychophysical experiments. Another approach (two-level approach) requires fitting psychometric functions to each individual participant data using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and then testing the hypotheses on the multiple participants by means of a second level analysis. For either options, the implementation of the statistical analysis in R is possible and beneficial. Here, we introduce the package MixedPsy to model and fit psychometric data in R, either with two-level and GLMM approaches. The package, freely available in the CRAN repository, uses different methods for the estimation of Point of Subjective Equivalence (PSE) and Just Noticeable Difference (JND), and provides utilities for immediate visualization and plotting of the fitted results.

    "abstract": "Understanding whether sex-related differences in the associations between emotion negativity and reward processing are present in early childhood has the potential to critically inform the etiology and prevention of psychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulated negative affect. Previous research suggests that altered neural processing of reward is associated with elevated levels of negative affect in adolescents and that the patterns of these associations may show sex-related differences. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between negative affect and reward processing in young children and none have directly examined potential sex-related differences in this relationship during early childhood. The current study investigated potential sex-related differences in neural response to reward feedback using EEG and their sex-specific association with emotional negativity in 140 children 4-7 years of age. Children completed a developmentally appropriate reward processing task while EEG data was recorded. Temporospatial Principal Component Analysis was used to separate overlapping feedback-related ERP components, revealing that males had greater loss-related feedback negativity and gain- and loss-related P200 values than females. At the individual level, males also showed a negative correlation between emotional negativity scores and gain-related P200 amplitudes. In line with prior work in adults for sex differences in attentional biases to emotional stimuli, these results suggest that neural mechanisms leading to sex differences in abnormal development of emotional negativity may emerge during early childhood and grow in magnitude during adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Modern mammals, birds, and non-avian reptiles have shared developmental and evolutionary origins in the ancestral amniotes of 300 million years ago. A previous analysis of a newly completed dataset on the cellular composition of the major parts of the brain of 242 amniote species, generated using the same cell counting method, the isotropic fractionator, argued for changes in the body-brain relationship in amniote evolution (Kverkova et al., 2022), but did not explore how the brains of amniotes diverged in their neuronal composition. Here I show, using the same dataset but focusing instead on the cellular composition of the brains regardless of body mass and phylogenetic relatedness, that the brains of extant mammalian, avian, and non-avian reptile species are characterized by signature proportions of numbers of neurons across the pallium, the cerebellum, and the rest of brain. An increase to a higher, fixed proportion of 4.5 neurons in the cerebellum to every neuron in the rest of brain, with variable numbers of pallial neurons, characterizes the avian brain compared to other reptiles, whereas mammalian brains are characterized by an average 4 neurons in the cerebellum to every neuron in the pallium regardless of numbers of neurons in the rest of brain, which also differs from the proportion in most non-avian reptilian brains of 1.4 neurons in the pallium and 0.5 neuron in the cerebellum to every neuron in the rest of brain. Thus, the independent evolution of endothermy in birds and mammals occurred with dramatic increases in numbers of neurons in all brain structures that differed markedly between birds and mammals. Additionally, there are marked continuities in the scaling of extant amniote brains that allow for the neuronal composition of the brain of ancestral amniotes to be estimated. Using these similarities in the neuronal scaling rules between living mammals and non-avian reptiles, I provide scaling relationships that allow predicting the composition of early mammaliaform and synapsid brains in amniote evolution, and I propose a simple model of amniote brain evolution that accounts for the diversity of modern mammalian, avian, and non-avian reptilian brains with only a few clade-shifting events in brain connectivity between cerebral cortex and cerebellum in mammals and between the cerebellum and rest of brain in birds, building on the increased availability of energy supply to the brain associated with the evolution of the increased oxidative and cardiovascular capacities that underlie endothermy.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neuronal composition of the brains of dinosaurs and other fossil amniotes would offer fundamental insight into their behavioral and cognitive capabilities, but brain tissue is only rarely fossilized. However, when the bony brain case is preserved, the volume and therefore mass of the brain can be estimated with computer tomography; and if the scaling relationship between brain mass and numbers of neurons for the clade is known, that relationship can be applied to estimate the neuronal composition of the brain. Using a recently published database of numbers of neurons in the telencephalon of extant sauropsids (birds, squamates and testudines), here I show that the neuronal scaling rules that apply to these animals can be used to infer the numbers of neurons that composed the telencephalon of dinosaur, pterosaur and other fossil sauropsid species. The key to inferring numbers of telencephalic neurons in these species is first using the relationship between their estimated brain and body mass to determine whether bird-like (endothermic) or squamate-like (ectothermic) rules apply to each fossil sauropsid species. This procedure shows that the notion of \"mesothermy\" in dinosaurs is an artifact due to the mixing of animals with bird-like and squamate-like scaling, and indicates that theropods such as Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus were endotherms with baboon- and monkey-like numbers of telencephalic neurons, respectively, which would make these animals not only giant but also long-lived and endowed with flexible cognition, and thus even more magnificent predators than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Memories may be encoded in the brain via strongly interconnected groups of neurons, called assemblies. The concept of Hebbian plasticity suggests that these assemblies are generated through synaptic plasticity, strengthening the recurrent connections within select groups of neurons that receive correlated stimulation. To remain stable in absence of such stimulation, the assemblies need to be self-reinforcing under the plasticity rule. Previous models of such assembly maintenance require additional mechanisms of fast homeostatic plasticity often with biologically implausible timescales. Here we provide a model of neuronal assembly generation and maintenance purely based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) between excitatory neurons. It uses irregularly and stochastically spiking neurons and STDP that depresses connections of uncorrelated neurons. We find that assemblies do not grow beyond a certain size, because temporally imprecisely correlated spikes dominate the plasticity in large assemblies. Assemblies in the model can be learned or spontaneously emerge. The model allows for prominent, stable overlap structures between static assemblies. Further, assemblies can drift, particularly according to a novel, transient overlap-based mechanism. Finally the model indicates that assemblies grow in the aging brain, where connectivity decreases.\n\nAuthor summaryIt is widely assumed that memories are represented by ensembles of nerve cells that have strong interconnections with each other. It is to date not clear how such strongly interconnected nerve cell ensembles form, persist, change and age. Here we show that already a basic rule for activity-dependent synaptic strength plasticity can explain the learning or spontaneous formation and the stability of assemblies. In particular, it is not necessary to explicitly keep the overall total synaptic strength of a neuron nearly constant, a constraint that was incorporated in previous models in a manner inconsistent with current experimental knowledge. Furthermore, our model achieves the challenging task of stably maintaining many overlaps between assemblies and generating the experimentally observed drift of memory representations. Finally, the model predicts that if the number of synaptic connections in the brain decreases, as observed during aging, the size of the neuron ensembles underlying memories increases. This may render certain memories in the aging brain more robust and prominent but also less specific.",

    "abstract": "Musashi RNA-binding proteins retain a pivotal role in stem cell maintenance, tumorigenesis, and nervous system development. Recently, we showed in C. elegans that MSI1 actively promotes forgetting upon associative learning via a 3UTR-dependent translational expression of the Arp2/3 actin branching complex. Here, we investigated the evolutionary conserved role of MSI proteins and the effect of their pharmacological inhibition on memory. Expression of human MSI1 and MSI2 under the endogenous musashi promoter fully rescued the phenotype of msi-1(lf) worms. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of MSI1 and MSI2 activity using (-)-gossypol resulted in improved memory retention, without causing locomotor, chemotactic, or learning deficits. No drug effect was observed in msi-1(lf) treated worms. Using Western blotting and confocal microscopy we found no changes in MSI-1 protein abundance following (-)-gossypol treatment, suggesting that musashi gene expression remains unaltered and that the compound exerts its inhibitory effect post-translationally. Additionally, (-)-gossypol suppressed the previously seen rescue of the msi-1(lf) phenotype in worms expressing human MSI1 specifically in the AVA neuron, indicating that (-)-gossypol can regulate the musashi pathway in a memory-related neuronal circuit in worms. Finally, treating aged worms with (-)-gossypol reversed physiological age-dependent memory decline. Taken together, our findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of musashi might represent a promising approach for memory modulation.",

    "abstract": "The invention of the miniaturized microscope has enabled neuroscientists to investigate neural mechanisms in freely moving mice. A lot of efforts have been made to optimize performance of the miniaturized microscope. However, the tethered cables limit the ability of mini-microscope systems to record neural activity from multiple mice simultaneously. Here, we present a wireless mini-microscope (wScope) that enables both real-time remote control and data preview during animal behavior; this design also supports simultaneous recording from up to 8 mice. The wScope has a mass of 2.7 g and a maximum frame rate of 25 Hz at 750 m by 450 m field of view with 1.8 m resolution. We validated the wScopes in video-recording of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of different mice. The wScope provides a powerful tool for brain imaging of free moving animals, including large primates, in their much larger spaces and more naturalistic environments.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia and is linked to the spreading of pathological amyloid-{beta} and tau proteins throughout the brain. Recent studies have highlighted stark differences in how amyloid-{beta} and tau affect neurons at the cellular scale. On a larger scale, Alzheimers patients are observed to undergo a period of early-stage neuronal hyperactivation followed by neurodegeneration and frequency-slowing of neuronal oscillations. Herein, we model the spreading of both amyloid-{beta} and tau across a human connectome and investigate how the neuronal dynamics are affected by disease progression. By including the effects of both amyloid-{beta} and tau pathology, we find that our model explains AD-related frequency slowing, early-stage hyperactivation, and late-stage hypoactivation. By testing different hypotheses, we show that hyperactivation and frequency-slowing are not due to the topological interactions between different regions but are mostly the result of local neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-{beta} and tau protein.",

    "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and leading cause of neurological infection in Asia and the Pacific, with recent emergence in multiple territories in Australia in 2022. Patients may experience devastating socioeconomic consequences; JEV infection (JE) predominantly affects children in poor rural areas, has a 20-30% case fatality rate, and 30-50% of survivors suffer long-term disability. JEV RNA is rarely detected in patient samples, and the standard diagnostic test is an anti-JEV IgM ELISA with sub-optimal specificity; there is no means of detection in more remote areas. We aimed to test the hypothesis that there is a diagnostic protein signature of JE in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and contribute to understanding of the host response and predictors of outcome during infection.\n\nWe retrospectively tested a cohort of 163 patients recruited as part of the Laos central nervous system infection study. Application of liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), using extensive offline fractionation and tandem mass tag labelling, enabled a comparison of the CSF proteome in 68 JE patient vs 95 non-JE neurological infections. 5,070 proteins were identified, including 4,805 human proteins and 265 pathogen proteins. We incorporated univariate analysis of differential protein expression, network analysis and machine learning techniques to build a ten-protein diagnostic signature of JE with >99% diagnostic accuracy. Pathways related to JE infection included neuronal damage, anti-apoptosis, heat shock and unfolded protein responses, cell adhesion, macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as a reduced acute inflammatory response, hepatotoxicity, activation of coagulation, extracellular matrix and actin regulation. We verified the results by performing DIA LC-MS/MS in 16 (10%) of the samples, demonstrating 87% accuracy using the same model. Ultimately, antibody-based validation will be required, in a larger group of patients, in different locations and in field settings, to refine the list to 2-3 proteins that could be harnessed in a rapid diagnostic test.\n\nAuthor summaryJapanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a leading cause of brain infection in Asia and the Pacific, with recent introduction in multiple territories in Australia in 2022. Patients may experience devastating socioeconomic consequences; JEV infection (JE) predominantly affects children in poor rural areas, has a 20-30% case fatality rate, and 30-50% of survivors suffer long-term disability. The disease is difficult to diagnose, and there are no rapid tests that may be performed in remote areas that it exists such that we remain unclear of the burden of disease and the effects of control measures. We aimed to apply a relatively novel method to analyse the proteins in patients with JE as compared to other neurological infections, to see if this could be useful for making a diagnosis.\n\nWe tested the brain fluid of 163 patients recruited as part of the Laos central nervous system infection study. We used a method,  liquid chromatography mass spectrometry that does not require prior knowledge of the proteins present, that is you do not target any specific protein. Over 5,000 proteins were identified, and these were analysed by various methods. We grouped the proteins into different clusters that provided insight into their function. We also filtered the list to 10 proteins that predicted JE as compared to other brain infections. Future work will require confirmation of the findings in a larger group of patients, in different locations and in field settings, to refine the list to 2-3 proteins that could be harnessed in a rapid diagnostic test.",

    "abstract": "Perturbations such as climate change, invasive species and pollution, impact the functioning and diversity of ecosystems. But because there is no unique way to measure functioning and diversity, this leads to a ubiquitous and overwhelming variability in community-level responses, that is often seen as a barrier to prediction in ecology. Here, we show that this variability can instead provide insights into hidden features of a communitys functions and responses to perturbations. By first analysing a dataset of global change experiments in microbial soil systems we show that variability of functional and diversity responses to a given perturbation is not random: aggregate properties that are thought to be mechanistically similar tend to respond similarly. We then formalise this intuitive observation to demonstrate that the variability of community-level responses to perturbations is not only predictable, but that it can also be used to access hidden and useful information about population-level responses to perturbations (i.e., response diversity and scaling by species biomass). Our theory offers a baseline expectation for the variability of community-level responses to perturbations and helps to explain the complexity of ecological responses to global change.\n\nSignificance StatementMeasures of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning show highly variable responses to a given perturbation. This variability is traditionally thought of as reflecting our inability to predict ecological responses to global change. Our work, however, finds that variability of community-level responses is itself predictable and can even be used to gain insights about how species respond to perturbations and collectively contribute to ecosystem functions.",

    "abstract": "Recent fossil discoveries suggest that Neandertals and Homo sapiens may have co-existed in Europe for as long as five to six thousand years. Yet, evidence for their contemporaneity at any regional scale remains elusive. In France and northern Spain, a region which features some of the latest directly-dated Neandertals in Europe, Protoaurignacian assemblages attributed to Homo sapiens appear to  replace Neandertal-associated Chatelperronian assemblages. Using the earliest and latest known occurrences as starting points, Bayesian modelling has provided some indication that these occupations may in fact have been partly contemporaneous. The reality, however, is that we are unlikely to ever identify the  first or  last appearance of a species or cultural tradition in the archaeological and fossil record. Here, we use optimal linear estimation modelling to estimate the first appearance date of Homo sapiens and the extinction date of Neandertals in France and northern Spain by statistically inferring these  missing portions of the Protoaurignacian and Chatelperronian archaeological records. Additionally, we estimate the extinction date of Neandertals in this region using a set of directly-dated Neandertal fossil remains. The results suggest that the onset of the Homo sapiens occupation of this region likely preceded the extinction of Neandertals and the Chatelperronian by up to 1400-2900 years - raising the possibility of an extended co-existence of these groups during the initial Upper Palaeolithic of this region. Whether or not this co-existence featured some form of direct interaction, however, remains to be resolved.",

    "abstract": "Super-enhancers (SEs) are a class of compound regulatory elements which control expression of key cell-identity genes. It remains unclear whether they are simply clusters of independent classical enhancers or whether SEs manifest emergent properties and should therefore be considered as a distinct class of element. Here, using synthetic biology and genome editing, we engineered the well characterised erythroid -globin SE at the endogenous -globin locus, removing all SE constituent elements in a mouse embryonic stem cell-line, to create a \"blank canvas\". This has allowed us to re-build the SE through individual and combinatorial reinsertion of its five elements (R1, R2, R3, Rm, R4), to test the importance of each constituents sequence and position within the locus. Each re-inserted element independently creates a region of open chromatin and binds its normal repertoire of transcription factors; however, we found a high degree of functional interdependence between the five constituents. Surprisingly, the two strongest -globin enhancers (R1 and R2) act sub-optimally both on their own and in combination, and although the other three elements (R3, Rm and R4) exhibit no discernible enhancer activity, they each exert a major positive effect in facilitating the activity of the classical enhancers (R1 and R2). This effect depends not simply on the sequence of each element but on their positions within the cluster. We propose that these \"facilitators\" are a novel form of regulatory element, important for ensuring the full activity of SEs, but distinct from conventional enhancer elements.",

While many human genes can functionally replace their yeast counterparts, nearly half of the tested shared genes cannot. For example, most yeast proteasome subunits are humanizable, except subunits comprising the {beta}-ring core, including {beta}2 (HsPSMB7). We developed a high-throughput pipeline to humanize yeast proteasomes by generating a large library of Hs{beta}2 mutants and screening them for complementation of yeast {beta}2 (ScPup1). Variants capable of replacing ScPup1 included (1) those impacting local protein-protein interactions (PPIs), with most affecting interactions between the {beta}2 C-terminal tail and the adjacent {beta}3 subunit, and (2) those affecting {beta}2 proteolytic activity. Exchanging the full-length tail of human {beta}2 with that of ScPup1 enabled complementation. Moreover, wild-type human {beta}2 replaced yeast {beta}2 if the adjacent human {beta}3 subunit was also provided. Unexpectedly, yeast proteasomes bearing a catalytically inactive HsPSMB7-T44A variant blocking precursor autoprocessing were viable, suggesting an intact propeptide stabilizes late assembly intermediates. Our data reveal roles for specific PPIs governing functional replaceability across vast evolutionary distances.",

Cellular deconvolution of gene signatures based on network compactness across cell types revealed breast cancer prognostic markers associated with T cells. scHumanNet could also prioritize genes associated with particular cell types using CSN centrality and identified the differential hubness of CSNs between disease and healthy conditions.

However, not much is known about the effect of synthetic cooling agents such as WS-23 on AECs. WS-23 is a synthetic menthol-like cooling agent widely used to enhance the appeal of e-cigs and to suppress the harshness and bitterness of other e-cig constituents. Using primary human AECs, we compared the effects of aerosolized WS-23 with propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin (PG/VG) vehicle control and nicotine aerosol exposures. AECs treated with 3% WS-23 aerosols showed a significant increase in viable cell numbers compared to PG/VG-vehicle aerosol exposed cells and cell growth was comparable following 2.5% nicotine aerosol exposure. AEC inflammatory factors, IL-6 and ICAM-1 levels were significantly suppressed by WS-23 aerosols compared to PG/VG-controls. When differentiated AECs were challenged with WS-23 aerosols, there was a significant increase in MUC5AC+ goblet cells with no discernible change in SCGB1A1+ secretory cells. Compared to PG/VG-controls, WS-23 or nicotine aerosols presented with increased goblet cell numbers, but there was no synergistic effect of WS-23+nicotine combination exposure. Thus, WS-23 and nicotine aerosols modulate the AEC responses and induce goblet cell hyperplasia, which could impact the airway physiology and susceptibility to respiratory diseases.",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses replicate at a high mutation rate, providing a highly adaptive capacity to the population as well as vulnerability to an extinction due to additional mutations, which is the conceptual basis for lethal mutagenesis. However, the mechanistic understanding of lethal mutagenesis has remained unclear due to the lack of RNA mutagens with potent antiviral activity and the inherent inability to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious sub-populations within a viral population. In our study, we investigated how the replication competency and mutation frequency of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) change following treatment with the RNA mutagen {beta}-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, a potent antiviral RNA mutagen. By pairing limiting dilution with a long-read sequencing approach, we specifically determined genomic sequences of replication-competent viral clones from the total population. We found that replication-competent VEEV population maintained itself within a narrow mutation spectrum with a significantly lower mutation frequency than the total population. We also found that treatment with an RNA mutagen did not induce catastrophic destruction of the infectious population even at a high exposure, allowing replication-competent subpopulations with increased variability in mutational fitness and enhanced adaptability to new selection pressures, such as antiviral treatment, to continue to propagate. Together our study provides new understanding of viral population landscape and suggests a careful consideration of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy for high-capacity replicating viruses such as alphaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Plants exude large quantities of rhizosphere metabolites that can modulate composition and activity of microbial communities in response to environmental stress. While rhizodeposition dynamics have been associated with rhizosphere microbiome succession, and may be particularly impactful in stressful conditions, specific evidence of these connections has rarely been documented. Here, we grew the bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) in a marginal soil, under nutrient limited, moisture limited, +nitrogen (N), and +phosphorus (P) conditions, to identify links between rhizosphere chemistry, microbiome dynamics, and abiotic stressors. To characterize links between rhizosphere microbial communities and metabolites, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics. We measured significant changes in rhizosphere metabolite profiles in response to abiotic stress and linked them to changes in microbial communities using network analysis. N-limitation amplified the abundance of aromatic acids, pentoses, and their derivatives in the rhizosphere, and their enhanced availability was linked to the abundance of diverse bacterial lineages from Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and Alphaproteobacteria. Conversely, N-amended conditions enhanced the availability of N-rich rhizosphere compounds, which coincided with proliferation of Actinobacteria. Treatments with contrasting N availability differed greatly in the abundance of potential keystone metabolites; serotonin, ectoine, and acetylcholine were particularly abundant in N-replete soils, while chlorogenic, cinnamic, and glucuronic acids were found in N-limited soils. Serotonin, the keystone metabolite we identified with the largest number of links to microbial taxa, significantly affected root architecture and growth of rhizosphere microorganisms, highlighting its potential to shape microbial community and mediate rhizosphere plant-microbe interactions.\n\nSignificancePlants and microorganisms release metabolites that mediate rhizosphere host-microbe interactions and modulate plant adaptation to environmental stresses. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin rhizosphere metabolite-microbiome dynamics, their functional relationships, and the biological role of plant- or microbial-produced soil metabolites remain largely unknown. Here, we found the abundances of specific classes of rhizosphere soil metabolites were responsive to abiotic stressors, and also connected to specific shifts in the rhizosphere microbial community and plant phenotypes. We propose a suite of understudied rhizosphere compounds as keystone metabolites that may structure the rhizosphere microbiome and influence plant metabolism in response to nutrient availability. These links between rhizosphere metabolites and microbial communities point to research avenues where we might leverage plant-microbe interactions to engineer enhanced rhizosphere microbiome function, plant and ecosystem health.",

    "abstract": "We report a mechanism that underlies stress-induced cognitive inflexibility at the molecular level. In a mouse model under subacute stress in which deficits in rule shifting tasks were elicited, the nuclear glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (N-GAPDH) cascade was activated specifically in microglia in the prelimbic cortex. The cognitive deficits were normalized with a pharmacological intervention with a compound (the RR compound) that selectively blocked the initiation of N-GAPDH cascade without affecting glycolytic activity. The normalization was also observed with a microglia-specific genetic intervention targeting the N-GAPDH cascade. Furthermore, hyperactivation of the prelimbic layer 5 excitatory neurons, which are known to be a neuronal substrate of cognitive inflexibility, was also normalized by the pharmacological and microglia-specific genetic interventions. The RR compound may offer a mechanism-driven, translational opportunity against stress-induced cognitive inflexibility. Taken together, we show a pivotal role of cortical microglia and microglia-neuron interaction in stress-induced cognitive inflexibility. We underscore the N-GAPDH cascade in microglia, which causally mediates stress-induced cognitive alteration.",

However, we lack knowledge on the network topologies associated with stability and the pathways shaping these networks. In a 13-year mesocosm experiment, we determined links between plant community stability and soil microbial networks. We found that plant communities on soil abandoned from agricultural practices 60 years prior to the experiment promoted destabilising properties and were associated with coupled prokaryote and fungal soil networks. This coupling was mediated by strong interactions of plants and microbiota with soil resource cycling. Conversely, plant communities on natural grassland soil exhibited a high stability, which was associated with decoupled prokaryote and fungal soil networks. This decoupling was mediated by a large variety of past plant community pathways shaping especially fungal networks. We conclude that plant community stability is associated with a decoupling of prokaryote and fungal soil networks and mediated by plant-soil interactions.",

    "abstract": "The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) glycoprotein folding Quality Control (ERQC) machinery aids folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoprotein recognition and ER-retention is mediated by the ERQC checkpoint enzyme, the 170 kDa UDP-Glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT). UGGT modulation is a promising strategy for broad-spectrum antivirals, rescue-of-secretion therapy in rare disease caused by responsive mutations in glycoprotein genes, and many cancers, but to date no selective UGGT inhibitors are known. Towards the generation of selective UGGT inhibitors, we determined the crystal structures of the catalytic domain of Chaetomium thermophilum UGGT (CtUGGTGT24), alone and in complex with the inhibitor UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (U2F). Using the CtUGGTGT24 crystals, we carried out a fragment-based lead discovery screen via X-ray crystallography and discovered that the small molecule 5-[(morpholin-4-yl)methyl]quinolin-8-ol (5M-8OH-Q) binds a CtUGGTGT24  WY conserved surface motif that is not present in other GT24 family glycosyltransferases. The 5M-8OH-Q molecule has a 613 {micro}M binding affinity for human UGGT1in vitro as measured by saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. The 5M-8OH-Q molecule inhibits both human UGGT1and UGGT2 activity at concentrations higher than 750 {micro}M in modified HEK293-6E cells. The compound is toxic in cellula and in planta at concentrations higher than 1 mM. A few off-target effects are also observed upon 5M-8OH-Q treatment. Based on an in silico model of the interaction between UGGT and its substrate N -glycan, the 5M-8OH-Q molecule likely works as a competitive inhibitor, binding to the site of recognition of the first GlcNAc residue of the substrate N -glycan.\n\nSignificance StatementWhen a candidate drug target is the product of a housekeeping gene - i.e. it is important for the normal functioning of the healthy cell - availability of inhibitors for tests and assays is of paramount importance. One such housekeeping protein is UGGT, the enzyme that makes sure that only correctly folded glycoproteins can leave the endoplasmic reticulum for further trafficking through the secretory pathway. UGGT is a potential drug target against viruses, in certain instances of congenital rare disease, and against some cancers, but no UGGT inhibitors are known yet. We discovered and describe here a small molecule that binds human UGGT1 in vitro and inhibits both isoforms of human UGGT in cellula. The compound paves the way to testing of UGGT inhibition as a potential pharmacological strategy in a number of medical contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abl family kinases are evolutionarily conserved regulators of cell migration and morphogenesis. Genetic experiments in Drosophila suggest that Abl family kinases interact functionally with microtubules to regulate axon guidance and neuronal morphogenesis. Vertebrate Abl2 binds to microtubules and promotes their plus-end elongation both in vitro and in cells, but the molecular mechanisms by which Abl2 regulates microtubule (MT) dynamics were unclear. We report here that Abl2 regulates MT assembly via condensation and direct interactions with both the MT lattice and tubulin dimers. We find that Abl2 promotes MT nucleation, which is further facilitated by the ability of the Abl2 C-terminal half to undergo phase separation and form co-condensates with tubulin. A naturally occurring tubulin binding-deficient Abl2 splice isoform fails to promote nucleation. Abl2 binds to regions adjacent to MT damage and facilitates their repair via fresh tubulin recruitment and increases MT rescue frequency and lifetime. MT recovery after nocodazole treatment is greatly slowed in Abl2 knockout COS-7 cells compared to wild type cells. We propose a model in which Abl2 locally concentrates tubulin and recruits it to MT tips or to defects in the MT lattice to promote MT repair, rescue, and nucleation.",

    "abstract": "Destabilizing domains (DDs) are an attractive strategy allowing for positive post-transcriptional small molecule-regulatable control of a fusion proteins abundance. Yet in many instances, the currently available DDs suffer from higher-than-desirable basal levels of the fusion protein. Accordingly, we redesigned the E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) DD by introducing a library of ~1200 random ecDHFR mutants fused to YFP into CHO cells. Following successive rounds of FACS sorting, we identified six new ecDHFR DD clones with significantly enhanced proteasomal turnover in the absence of a stabilizing ligand, trimethoprim (TMP). One of these clones, designated as  C12, contained four unique missense mutations (W74R/T113S/E120D/Q146L) and demonstrated a significant 2.9-fold reduction in basal levels compared to the conventional ecDHFR DD YFP. This domain was similarly responsive to TMP with respect to dose-response and maximal stabilization, indicating an overall enhanced dynamic range. Interestingly, both computational and wet-lab experiments identified the W74R and T113S mutations of C12 as the main contributors towards its basal destabilization. Yet, the combination of all the C12 mutations were required to maintain both its enhanced degradation and TMP stabilization. We further demonstrate the utility of C12 by fusing it to I{kappa}B and Nrf2, two stress-responsive proteins that have previously been challenging to regulate. In both instances, C12 significantly enhanced the basal turnover of these proteins and improved the dynamic range of regulation post stabilizer addition. These advantageous features of the C12 ecDHFR DD variant highlight its potential for replacing the conventional N-terminal ecDHFR DD, and overall improving the use of destabilizing domains, not only as a chemical biology tool, but for gene therapy avenues as well.",

    "abstract": "Ordered supramolecular assemblies of supercharged synthetic proteins have recently been created using electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged proteins. Despite recent progress, the fundamental mechanisms governing the assembly process between oppositely supercharged proteins are not fully understood. In this work, we use a combination of experiments and computational modeling to systematically study the supramolecular assembly process for a series of oppositely supercharged green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants. Our results show that the assembled structures of oppositely supercharged proteins critically depend on surface charge distributions. In addition, net charge is a sufficient molecular descriptor to predict the interaction fate of oppositely charged proteins under a given set of solution conditions (e.g., ionic strength). Interestingly, our results show that a large excess of charge is necessary to nucleate assembly and that charged residues that are not directly involved in interprotein interactions contribute to a substantial fraction ([~]30%) of the interaction energy between oppositely charged proteins via long-range electrostatic interactions. Dynamic subunit exchange experiments enabled by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) further show that relatively small, 16-subunit assemblies of oppositely charged proteins have kinetic lifetimes on the order of [~]10-40 minutes, which is governed by protein composition and solution conditions. Overall, our work shows that a balance between kinetic stability and electrostatic charge ultimately determine the fate of supramolecular assemblies of supercharged proteins. Broadly, our results inform how protein supercharging can be used to generate different ordered supramolecular assemblies from a single parent protein building block.",

We have now developed an approach for the targeted induction of HLA to restore sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to T cell-mediated killing. Using synNotch technology, we have generated T cells that, upon binding of the neuroblastoma surface antigen GD2, secrete IFN-{gamma} without conferring direct cytotoxic activity (snGD2i). Treatment with snGD2i cells induces high and durable expression of HLA on neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo and restores sensitivity to TCR-transgenic T cells targeting neuroblastoma-specific antigens. In contrast, treatment does not lead to upregulation of immune checkpoints or systemically increased levels of IFN-{gamma}. Targeted delivery of IFN-{gamma} using snGD2i cells is a promising new strategy to address immune escape in neuroblastoma.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEHLA loss remains one of the most common and unsolved immune escape mechanisms in cancer cells.

    "abstract": "RNA-protein interactions are crucial for diverse biological processes. In prokaryotes, RNA-protein interactions enable adaptive immunity through CRISPR-Cas systems. These defense systems utilize CRISPR RNA (crRNA) templates acquired from past infections to destroy foreign genetic elements through crRNA-mediated nuclease activities of Cas proteins. Thanks to the programmability and specificity of CRISPR-Cas systems, CRISPR-based antimicrobials have the potential to be repurposed as new types of antibiotics. Unlike traditional antibiotics, these CRISPR-based antimicrobials can be designed to target specific bacteria and minimize detrimental effects on the human microbiome during antibacterial therapy. Here, we explore the potential of CRISPR-based antimicrobials by optimizing the RNA-protein interactions of crRNAs and Cas13 proteins. CRISPR-Cas13 systems are unique as they degrade specific foreign RNAs using the crRNA template, which leads to non-specific RNase activities and cell cycle arrest. We show that a high proportion of the Cas13 systems have no colocalized CRISPR arrays, and the lack of direct association between crRNAs and Cas proteins may result in suboptimal RNA-protein interactions in the current tools. Here, we investigate the RNA-protein interactions of the Cas13-based systems by curating the validation dataset of Cas13 protein and CRISPR repeat pairs that are experimentally validated to interact, and the candidate dataset of CRISPR repeats that reside on the same genome as the currently known Cas13 proteins. To find optimal CRISPR-Cas13 interactions, we first validate the 3-D structure prediction of crRNAs based on their experimental structures. Next, we test a number of RNA-protein interaction programs to optimize the in silico docking of crRNAs with the Cas13 proteins. From this optimized pipeline, we find a number of candidate crRNAs that have comparable or better in silico docking with the Cas13 proteins of the current tools. This study fully automatizes the in silico optimization of RNA-protein interactions as an efficient preliminary step for designing effective CRISPR-Cas13-based antimicrobials.",

The free energy available from the reaction is used to pump protons and to establish a membrane proton electrochemical gradient, which drives ATP synthesis. Even though several high-resolution structures of complex I have been resolved, how Q reduction is linked with proton pumping, remains unknown. Here, microsecond long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on Yarrowia lipolytica complex I structures where Q molecules have been resolved in the ~30 [A] long Q tunnel. MD simulations of several different redox/protonation states of Q reveal the coupling between the Q dynamics and the restructuring of conserved loops and ion pairs. Oxidized quinone stabilizes towards the N2 FeS cluster, a binding mode not previously described in Yarrowia lipolytica complex I structures. On the other hand, reduced (and protonated) species tend to diffuse towards the Q binding sites closer to the tunnel entrance.

    "abstract": "In plants the switch to autotrophic growth involves germination followed by post-germination seedling establishment. When environmental conditions are not favorable, the stress hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA) signals plants to postpone seedling establishment by inducing the expression of the transcription factor ABI5. The levels of ABI5 determine the efficiency of the ABA mediated post-germination developmental growth arrest. The molecular mechanisms regulating the stability and activity of ABI5 during the transition to light are less known. We found that two microProteins miP1a/ BBX31 and miP1b/BBX30 alongwith ABI5 inhibit post-germination seedling establishment in a partially interdependent manner. MicroProteins are single-domain proteins that interact with multi-domain proteins to modulate their post-translational activity. miP1a/ BBX31 and miP1b/BBX30 physically interact with ABI5 to stabilize it and promote its binding to promoters of downstream genes in light. ABI5 reciprocally induces the expression of BBX30 and BBX31 by directly binding to their promoter. ABI5 and the two microProteins thereby form a positive feedback loop to promote ABA-mediated developmental arrest of seedlings. Our study highlights the functional versatility of microProteins which can act as regulators of crucial developmental transitions in plants as well as other eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Queuosine (Q) is a naturally occurring modified nucleoside that occurs in the first position of transfer RNA anticodons such as Asp, Asn, His, and Tyr. As eukaryotes lack pathways to synthesize queuine, the Q nucleobase, they must obtain it from their diet or gut microbiota. Previously, we described the effects of queuine on the physiology of the eukaryotic parasite Entamoeba histolytica and characterized the enzyme EhTGT responsible for queuine incorporation into tRNA. At present, it is unknown how E. histolytica salvages Q from gut bacteria. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and N-acryloyl-3-aminophenylboronic acid (APB) PAGE analysis to demonstrate that E. histolytica trophozoites can salvage queuine from Q or E. coli K12 but not from the modified E. coli QueC strain, which cannot produce queuine. We then examined the role of EhDUF2419, a protein with homology to DNA glycosylase, as queuine salvage enzyme in E. histolytica. We found that glutathione S-transferase (GST)-EhDUF2419 catalyzed the conversion of Q into queuine. Trophozoites silenced for EhDUF2419 expression are impaired in their ability to form Q-tRNA from Q or from E. coli. We also observed that Q partially protects control trophozoites from oxidative stress (OS), but not siEhDUF2419 trophozoites. Overall, our data reveal that EhDUF2419 is central for the salvaging of queuine from bacteria and for the resistance of the parasite to OS.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved a variety of innate and adaptive immune strategies to fight bacteriophage (phage) infections. Innate defenses (unspecific mechanisms directed against any phage infecting the cell) range from the identification and cleavage of the viral DNA by restriction nucleases to the suicidal death of infected host cells, an extreme solution that prevents the spread of the infection throughout the population. Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, involves the creation of an immune memory that targets specific phages in case of reinfection. It is obvious that not every infection leads to the suicide of the host cell or to the formation of immune memory against the infecting phage, so what determines the outcome of an anti-phage response? In this work, we suggest that the dynamic aspects of phage infections are key to addressing this question. We show that the rates of viral DNA replication and cleavage define functional categories of phages that differ in their susceptibility to the immune strategies evolved by bacteria. From this viewpoint, the combined action of diverse bacterial defenses would be necessary to reduce the chances of phage immune evasion. This perspective allows us to formulate simple molecular mechanisms that could account for the decision of infected cells to undergo suicidal cell death or to incorporate new phages into the immune memory. This work highlights the importance of dynamics to understand bacterial immunity and formulates explicit hypotheses that could inspire a new and original empirical approach to the study of phage/bacteria interactions.",

    "abstract": "A harmful algae bloom occurred in late spring 2019 across multiple, interconnected fjords and bays in northern Norway. The event was caused by the haptophyte Chrysochromulina leadbeateri and led to severe fish mortality at several salmon aquaculture facilities. This study reports on the spatial and temporal succession dynamics of the holistic marine microbiome associated with this bloom by relating all detectable 18S and 16S rRNA gene ASVs to the relative abundance of the C. leadbeateri focal taxon. A k-medoids clustering enabled inferences on how the causative focal taxon co-bloomed with diverse groups of bacteria and microeukaryotes. These co-blooming patterns showed high temporal variability and were distinct between two geographically separated time series stations during the regional harmful algae bloom. The distinct blooming patterns observed with respect to each station were poorly connected to environmental conditions suggesting that other factors, such as biological interactions, may be at least as important in shaping the dynamics of this type of harmful algae bloom. A deeper understanding of microbiome succession patterns during these rare but destructive events will help guide future efforts to forecast deviations from the natural bloom cycles of the northern Norwegian coastal marine ecosystems that are home to intensive aquaculture activities.",

Here we employ cryo-electron tomography to reveal how the GV shell is formed by a helical filament of highly conserved GvpA subunits. This filament changes polarity at the center of the GV cylinder--a site that may act as an elongation center. High-resolution subtomogram averaging reveals a corrugated pattern of the shell arising from polymerization of GvpA into a {beta}-sheet. The accessory protein GvpC forms a helical cage around the GvpA shell, providing structural reinforcement.

Sister chromatid cohesion is promoted by acetylation of the SMC3 subunit of cohesin by the ESCO2 acetyltransferase, inhibiting cohesin release from chromatin. The interaction of ESCO2 with the DNA replication machinery, in part through PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) motifs in ESCO2, is required for full cohesion establishment. Recent reports have suggested that Cul4-dependent degradation regulates the level of ESCO2 protein during late S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. To follow up on these observations, we have characterized ESCO2 stability in Xenopus egg extracts, a cell-free system that recapitulates cohesion establishment in vitro. We found that ESCO2 was stable during DNA replication in this system. Indeed, further challenging the system by inducing DNA damage signaling or increasing the number of nuclei undergoing DNA replication had no significant impact on the stability of ESCO2. In transgenic somatic cell lines, we did not see evidence of GFP-ESCO2 degradation during S phase of the cell cycle using either flow cytometry or live-cell imaging techniques. We conclude that ESCO2 is stable during DNA replication in both embryonic and somatic cells.",

    "abstract": "Development of the Xenopus pronephros relies on renal precursors grouped at neurula stage into a specific region of dorso-lateral mesoderm called the kidney field. Formation of the kidney field at early neurula stage is dependent on retinoic (RA) signaling acting upstream of renal master transcriptional regulators such as pax8 or lhx1. Although lhx1 might be a direct target of RA-mediated transcriptional activation in the kidney field, how RA controls the emergence of the kidney field remains poorly understood. In order to better understand RA control of renal specification of the kidney field, we have performed a transcriptomic profiling of genes affected by RA disruption in lateral mesoderm explants isolated prior to the emergence of the kidney field and cultured at different time points until early neurula stage. Besides genes directly involved in pronephric development (pax8, lhx1, osr2, mecom), hox (hoxa1, a3, b3, b4, c5 and d1) and the hox co-factor meis3 appear as a prominent group of genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) downstream of RA. Supporting the idea of a role of meis3 in the kidney field, we have observed that meis3 depletion results in a severe inhibition of pax8 expression in the kidney field. Meis3 depletion only marginally affects expression of lhx1 and aldh1a2 suggesting that meis3 principally acts upstream of pax8. Further arguing for a role of meis3 and hox in the control of pax8, expression of a combination of meis3, hoxb4 and pbx1 in animal caps induces pax8 expression, but not that of lhx1. The same combination of TFs is also able to transactivate a previously identified pax8 enhancer, Pax8-CNS1. Mutagenesis of potential PBX-Hox binding motifs present in Pax8-CNS1 further allows to identify two of them that are necessary for transactivation. Finally, we have tested deletions of regulatory sequences in reporter assays with a previously characterized transgene encompassing 36.5 kb of the X. tropicalis pax8 gene that allows expression of a truncated pax8-GFP fusion protein recapitulating endogenous pax8 expression. This transgene includes three conserved pax8 enhancers, Pax8-CNS1, Pax8-CNS2 and Pax8-CNS3. Deletion of Pax8-CNS1 alone does not affect reporter expression, but deletion of a 3.5kb region encompassing Pax8-CNS1 and Pax8-CNS2 results in a severe inhibition of reporter expression both in the otic placode and kidney field domains.",

    "abstract": "Several computational frameworks and workflows that recover genomes from prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses from metagenomes exist. However, it is difficult for scientists with little bioinformatics experience to evaluate quality, annotate genes, dereplicate, assign taxonomy and calculate relative abundance and coverage of genomes belonging to different domains. MuDoGeR is a user-friendly tool accessible for non-bioinformaticians that make it easy to recover genomes of prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses from metagenomes, either alone or in combination. We tested MuDoGer using 24 individual-isolated genomes and 574 metagenomes, demonstrating the applicability for a few samples and high throughput. MuDoGeR is open-source software available at https://github.com/mdsufz/MuDoGeR.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent mutations in two pathways - the RNA spliceosome (eg. SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1) and epigenetic regulators (eg. DNMT3, TET2) - contribute to the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and related myeloid neoplasms. In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), SRSF2 mutations occur in [~]50% of patients and TET2 mutations in [~]60%, representing two of the most frequent mutations in these cancers. Clonal analysis has indicated that either mutation can arise as the founder lesion, however, our understanding of the basis for the co-operativity of these mutations in the evolution of CMML is limited. Based on human cancer genetics we crossed an inducible Srsf2P95H/+ mutant model with Tet2fl/fl mice to mutate both concomitantly (or individually) in hematopoietic stem cells. At 20-24 weeks post gene mutation, we observed subtle differences in the Srsf2/Tet2 mutants compared to either single mutant. Under conditions of native hematopoiesis with aging, we see a distinct myeloid bias and monocytosis in the Srsf2/Tet2 mutants. A subset of the compound Srsf2/Tet2 mutants display an increased granulocytic and distinctive monocytic proliferation (myelo-monocytic hyperplasia), with increased immature promonocytes and monoblasts ([~]10-15% total nucleated cells), and evidence of binucleate promonocytes. Exome analysis of progressed disease demonstrates mutations in genes and pathways similar to those reported in human CMML. Upon transplantation, recipients developed leukocytosis, monocytosis and splenomegaly. This demonstrates we can reproduce Srsf2/Tet2 co-operativity in vivo, yielding a disease with core characteristics of CMML, unlike single Srsf2 or Tet2 mutation. This model represents a significant step toward building high fidelity and genetically tractable models of CMML.\n\nKey pointsO_LISrsf2P95H/+ co-operates with Tet2-/- to initiate CMML in a murine model\nC_LIO_LISrsf2P95H and Tet2 null mutations synergize in the development of monocytosis\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Regardless of initiating cause, renal injury promotes a potent pro-inflammatory environment in the outer medulla and a concomitant sustained decrease in medullary blood flow (MBF). This decline in MBF is believed to one of the critical events in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI), yet the precise cellular mechanism underlying this are still to be fully elucidated. MBF is regulated by contractile pericyte cells that reside on the descending vasa recta (DVR) capillaries, which are the primary source of blood flow to the medulla. Using the rodent and murine live kidney slice models, we sought to investigate the acute effects of key medullary inflammatory mediators TNF-, IL-1{beta}, IL-33, IL-18, C3a and C5a on vasa recta pericytes. Live kidney slices taken from both mice and rats and exposed to TNF-, IL-18, IL-33, and C5a demonstrated a real-time pericyte-mediated constriction of DVR. When pro-inflammatory mediators were applied in the presence of the AT1-R blocker Losartan the inflammatory-mediated constriction that had previously been observed was significantly attenuated. When live kidney slices were exposed to inflammatory mediators for 4-hours, we noted a significantly reduction in the number of NG2+ positive pericytes along vasa recta capillaries in both rodent and murine kidney slices. Data collected in this study, demonstrate that inflammatory mediators can dysregulate pericytes to constrict DVR diameter and reduce the density of pericytes along vasa recta vessels, further diminishing the regulatory capacity of the capillary network. We postulate that preliminary findings here suggest pericytes play a role in AKI.\n\nNew & NoteworthyHow medullary blood flow (MBF) becomes disproportionately dysregulated following renal injury is poorly understood yet is associated with worse prognostic outcomes following AKI. This study shows in both rats and mice that inflammatory mediators associated with AKI have acute and sustained microvascular actions at pericytes eliciting dysregulation of descending vasa recta (DVR) diameter and their loss from the DVR. This work highlights a possible pathology behind the dysregulation and reduction of MBF observed following AKI.",

    "abstract": "Denitrification is a form of anaerobic respiration wherein nitrate is sequentially reduced via nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide to dinitrogen gas. The pathway has mostly been characterized in bacteria that have the complete denitrification pathway. However, each individual step can serve as a form of anaerobic respiration and many bacteria only have partial denitrification pathways. The conditions under which these partial denitrification pathways are activated have received comparatively little attention. Here we report the activity of partial denitrification pathways in two purple nonsulfur bacteria, Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 and Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003. These bacteria can use one or more denitrification steps as an electron sink during phototrophic growth or to transform energy during anaerobic respiration in the dark. In each case, nitrous oxide reduction required supplementation with a non-catalyzable denitrification intermediate. Thus, bacteria that maintain partial denitrification pathways are still subject to regulation by denitrification intermediates that they cannot use.\n\nImportanceDenitrification is a form of microbial respiration wherein nitrate is converted into dinitrogen gas, a major component of Earths atmosphere, via several nitrogen oxide intermediates. Unfortunately, denitrification of nitrate in agricultural fertilizers is often incomplete, resulting in the emission of the potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide. Some bacteria do not have all the steps for denitrification, but many can still reduce nitrous oxide into harmless dinitrogen gas. These partial denitrifying bacteria have received little attention. Here we characterized two partial denitrifying bacteria that are capable of nitrous oxide reduction. Surprisingly, nitrous oxide reduction was induced by denitrification intermediates that the bacteria could not respire, suggesting that regulation of nitrous oxide reduction was subject to the same cues as in complete denitrifiers. This work thus informs on how partial denitrifying bacteria can contribute to, and potentially combat, greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "Tissue homeostasis is tightly balanced between cell death and renewal. Each day, as many as 1011 cells die in the human body that need to be removed and replaced. The clearance of apoptotic cells, termed efferocytosis, is crucial to tissue homeostasis. Central to this process is macrophage-mediated efferocytosis. Apart from general phagocytosis, efferocytosis is apoptotic cell-specific, which aids in clearing dead cells and preventing the accumulation of self-antigens released by the apoptotic cells. The TAM family receptor kinases (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) and ligands (GAS6 and PROS) play important roles in engaging the apoptotic cells to initiate efferocytic engulfment and the downstream cellular responses. Dysregulated efferocytic function in macrophages is associated with human diseases such as atherosclerosis, lupus, lung fibrosis, and cancer. Conversely, understanding the regulation and molecular mechanisms of macrophage efferocytosis can potentially lead to beneficial treatments for the above diseases. Despite numerous efferocytosis studies that use primary and cell line-derived macrophages, there has not been a thorough characterization of a cell line system that can be reliably used for efferocytosis assays. Consequently, many macrophage efferocytosis assays reported do not clearly distinguish efferocytosis from phagocytosis. Here we evaluated the THP-1 cell line as a potential human macrophage cell line system for efferocytosis studies. Consequently, many macrophage efferocytosis assays reported do not clearly distinguish efferocytosis from phagocytosis. Through the study we examined the differential expression of the TAM family receptors and their ligands in the various THP-1 macrophage differentiation and polarization states. We also characterized the THP-1 cell line as a reliable system for performing in vitro efferocytosis studies.",
