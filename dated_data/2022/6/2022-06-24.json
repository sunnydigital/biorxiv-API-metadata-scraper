    "abstract": "In nature, bacteria prevailingly reside in the form of biofilms. These elaborately organized surface-bound assemblages of bacterial cells show numerous features of multicellular organization. We recently showed that biofilm growth is a true developmental process, which resembles developmental processes in multicellular eukaryotes. To study the biofilm growth, in a fashion of eukaryotic ontogeny, it is essential to define dynamics and critical transitional phases of this process. The first step in this endeavor is to record the gross morphological changes of biofilm ontogeny under standardized conditions. This visual information is instrumental in guiding the sampling strategy for the later omics analyses of biofilm ontogeny. However, none of the currently available visualizations methods is specifically tailored for recording gross morphology across the whole biofilm development. To address this void, here we present an affordable Arduino-based approach for time-lapse visualization of complete biofilm ontogeny. The major challenge in recording biofilm development on the air-solid interphase is water condensation, which compromises filming directly through the lid of a Petri dish. To overcome these trade-offs, we developed an Arduino microcontroller setup which synchronizes a robotic arm, responsible for opening and closing the Petri dish lid, with the activity of a stereomicroscope-mounted camera and lighting conditions. We placed this setup into microbiological incubator that maintains temperature and humidity during the biofilm growth. As a proof-of-principle, we recorded biofilm development of five Bacillus subtilis strains that show different morphological and developmental dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Interspecies interactions can drive the emergence of unexpected microbial phenotypes that are not observed when studying monocultures. The cystic fibrosis (CF) lung consists of a complex environment where particular microbes, living as polymicrobial biofilm-like communities, are associated with negative clinical outcomes for persons with CF (pwCF). However, the current lack of in vitro models integrating the microbial diversity observed in the CF airway hampers our understanding of why polymicrobial communities are recalcitrant to therapy in this disease. Here, integrating computational approaches informed by clinical data, we built a mixed community of clinical relevance to the CF lung composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Prevotella melaninogenica. We developed and validated this model biofilm community with multiple isolates of these four genera. When challenged with tobramycin, a front-line antimicrobial used to treat pwCF, the microorganisms in the polymicrobial community show altered sensitivity to this antibiotic compared to monospecies biofilms. We observed that wild-type P. aeruginosa is sensitized to tobramycin in a mixed community versus monoculture, and this observation holds across a range of community relative abundances. We also report that LasR loss-of-function, a variant frequently detected in the CF airway, induces tolerance of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin specifically in the mixed community. The molecular basis of this community-specific recalcitrance to tobramycin for the LasR mutant variant is the increased production of redox-active phenazines. Our data support the importance of studying clinically-relevant model polymicrobial biofilms to understand community-specific traits relevant to infections.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe CF lung is colonized by biofilm-like microbial communities that exhibit both resistance and tolerance (collectively called \"recalcitrance\") to antimicrobials used in the clinic. Here, we leveraged clinical data from pwCF to inform our understanding of communities exhibiting recalcitrance. We developed and validated an in vitro model that revealed novel, community-specific phenotypes relevant to the clinic. We used this model to explore the underlying mechanism associated with a community-specific emergent behavior. We posit that in vitro models of polymicrobial communities may help in developing new antimicrobial strategies to improve patient outcomes, and that the approach used here can be applied to other polymicrobial models.",

    "abstract": "Biogeographic variations in the gut microbiota reflect host and environmental factors delineating human populations, and are pivotal to understand global patterns of host-microbiota interactions in health and prevalent lifestyle-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Pakistani adults, having an exceptionally high prevalence of T2D, are one of the most understudied populations in microbiota research to date. The aim of the present study is to examine the gut microbiota across individuals from Pakistan and other populations of non-industrialized and industrialized lifestyles with a focus on T2D. The fecal samples from 94 urban-dwelling Pakistani adults with and without T2D were profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, and plasma samples quantified for circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and the activation ability of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-signaling. Publicly available datasets generated with comparable molecular methods were retrieved for comparative analysis. Overall, urbanized Pakistanis gut microbiota was similar to that of transitional or non-industrialized populations, depleted in Akkermansiaceae and enriched in Prevotellaceae (dominated by the non-Westernized clades of Prevotella copri). The relatively high proportion of Atopobiaceae appeared to be a unique characteristic of the Pakistani gut microbiota. The Pakistanis with T2D had elevated levels of LBP and TLR-signaling in circulation as well as gut microbial signatures atypical of other populations e.g., increased relative abundance of Libanicoccus/Parolsenella, limiting the inter-population extrapolation of gut microbiota-based classifiers for T2D. Taken together, our findings call for more global representation of understudied populations to extend the applicability of microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the number of aquatic diazotrophs is highly challenging and relies mainly on microscopical approaches and/or molecular tools that are based on nif genes. However, it is still challenging to count diazotrophs, especially the unicellular fraction, despite their significant contribution to the aquatic nitrogen cycle. In this study a new method was developed to quantify unicellular diazotrophs by immunolabeling the nitrogenase enzyme followed by identification and quantification via flow cytometry. The new quantification method was initially developed using a diazotrophic monoculture (Vibrio natriegens) and verified by various auxiliary approaches. It was found that only 15-20% of the total number of V. natriegens cells have synthesized the nitrogenase enzyme, even though the media was anaerobic, and N limited. This approach was further tested in samples from marine and freshwater environments. It was found that the ratio of diazotrophs to total bacteria was 0.1% in the Mediterranean Sea, while 4.7% along the Jordan River. In contrast, the specific N2 fixation per unicellular diazotrophs was highest in the Mediterranean Sea (88 attomole N cell-1 d-1) while the total N2 fixation rates were lowest in the lake and the river (0.2 nmole N L-1 d-1). Overall, we expect that this direct quantification approach will provide new insights on the number and contribution of unicellular diazotrophs to total N2 fixation in marine and freshwater environments under various conditions.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the metabolic profile of a microbial community is crucial for understanding its biological function and its impact on the host or environment. Metabolomics experiments directly measuring these profiles are difficult and expensive, while sequencing methods quantifying the species composition of microbial communities are well-developed and relatively cost-effective. Computational methods that are capable of predicting metabolomic profiles from microbial compositions can save considerable efforts needed for metabolomic profiling experimentally. Yet, despite existing efforts, we still lack a computational method with high prediction power, general applicability, and great interpretability. Here we develop a new method -- mNODE (Metabolomic profile predictor using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations), based on a state-of-the-art family of deep neural network models. We show compelling evidence that mNODE outperforms existing methods in predicting the metabolomic profiles of human microbiomes and several environmental microbiomes. Moreover, in the case of human gut microbiomes, mNODE can naturally incorporate dietary information to further enhance the prediction of metabolomic profiles. Besides, susceptibility analysis of mNODE enables us to reveal microbe-metabolite interactions, which can be validated using both synthetic and real data. The presented results demonstrate that mNODE is a powerful tool to investigate the microbiome-diet-metabolome relationship, facilitating future research on precision nutrition.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that causes acute and chronic lung infection in compromised hosts. During infection, the host innate immune system restricts iron to limit microbial growth. In response, P. aeruginosa induces expression of numerous virulence genes. Recently, our lab showed that some virulence factors are responsive to iron limitation in static but not shaking growth conditions, the former of which is likely to mimic growth in the chronically-infected lung. One of these novel iron-responsive factors is the HSI-2-type six secretion system (T6SS), which is also induced during chronic infection. Iron regulation of T6SS was partially impacted by deletion of the iron-responsive PrrF sRNA and completely dependent upon the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) biosynthetic gene pqsA. Here, we analyzed the impact of iron on the expression of two small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), RsmY and RsmZ, that activate expression of T6SS by sequestering the RsmA translation inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that iron starvation induces expression of RsmY and RsmZ in static but not shaking cultures. We further show that this induction occurs through the rsmY and rsmZ promoters and is dependent upon PqsA. We identified interrupted palindromes in the rsmY and rsmZ promoters as putative PqsR binding sites, and disruption of these sites eliminated iron-dependent regulation of rsmY and rsmZ promoter activity. To determine if iron-dependent regulation of the Rsm sRNAs is likely responsible for iron regulation of HSI-2 T6SS, we constructed translational and transcriptional reporters of the hsiA2 T6SS gene. Analysis of these reporters revealed robust PqsA-mediated iron regulation of the transcriptional reporter, as well as modest PrrF-dependent iron regulation of the translational reporter. Taken together, our results show novel iron regulatory pathways that are promoted by static growth, highlighting the importance of studying regulatory mechanisms in static communities that are likely more representative of chronic P. aeruginosa infections.\n\nIMPORTANCEIron is a central component of various bacterial metabolic pathways making it an important host acquired nutrient for pathogens to establish infection. Previous iron regulatory studies primaried relied on shaking bacterial cultures; while these ensure cultural homogeneity they do not reflect growth conditions during infection. We recently showed that static growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes iron-dependent regulation of a type six secretion system (T6SS), a virulence factor that is induced during chronic infections. In the current study, we found that static growth also promotes iron-dependent regulation of the RsmY and RsmZ sRNAs, which are global regulators that affect T6SS during chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection. Hence, our work demonstrates the Rsm sRNAs as potential effectors of iron regulation during static growth that may also be relevant in chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous uterine contractions are initiated when smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the uterine muscle, or myometrium, transition from a functionally dormant to an actively contractile phenotype at the end of the pregnancy period. We know that this process is accompanied by gestational time point-specific differences in the SMC transcriptome, which can be modulated by the Activator protein 1 (AP-1), Nuclear factor kappa beta (Nf-{kappa}{beta}), Estrogen receptor (ER), and Progesterone receptor (PR) transcription factors. Less is known, however, about the additional proteins that might assist these factors in conferring the transcriptional changes observed at labor onset. Here, we present functional evidence for the roles of two proteins previously understudied in the SMC context - MYB and ELF3 - which can contribute to the regulation of labor-driving gene transcription. We show that the MYB and ELF3 genes exhibit elevated transcript expression levels in mouse and human myometrial tissues during spontaneous term labor. The expression of both genes was also significantly increased in mouse myometrium during preterm labor induced by the progesterone antagonist, mifepristone (RU486), but not during infection-simulating preterm labor induced by intrauterine infusion of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, both MYB and ELF3 proteins affect labor-driving gene promoter activity, although in surprisingly opposing ways: Gja1 and Fos promoter activation increases in the presence of MYB and decreases in the presence of ELF3. Collectively, our study adds to the current understanding of the transcription factor network that defines the transcriptomes of SMCs during late gestation and implicates two new players in the control of labor timing.",

In recent years, the importance of ceramide in regulating vascular tone during viral infection and metabolic diseases has gained attention. The present study aimed to evaluate the plasma levels of ceramide and its association with plasma leakage in dengue patients.\n\nMethodsThe study involved 30 dengue samples involving severe dengue (SD-10), Dengue with Warning sign (DWW-10), Dengue without Warning Sign (DWOW-10), along with other febrile illness (OFI-10) controls. Samples were collected on the day of admission (DOA), day of defervescence (DOD), and day of convalescence (DOC). Total plasma ceramides (d18:1/22:0) were quantified using RP-HPLC. The correlation between ceramides and hematocrit/platelet count was evaluated using Spearman Rho Correlation. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software.\n\nResultsDuring the febrile phase, a significant (P[&le;]0.05) decrease in the levels of ceramides was observed in dengue compared to OFI (control). Towards the defervescences, the ceramides levels were substantially (P [&le;] 0.001) elevated in dengue groups compared to baseline. Most importantly, the ceramide levels were found to be higher in SD patients compared to non-severe dengue (DWW & DWOW) and OFI, particularly at the critical phase of infection. We observed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.867, P [&le;]0.001) between the platelet count and ceramide levels in SD subjects. Notably, a negative correlation was observed between ceramide and hematocrit during the defervescence phase (R = -0.355, P[&le;]0.05) in the AD group.\n\nConclusionElevated levels of circulating plasma ceramides during the defervescence phase of severe dengue show an essential role of ceramides in disease pathogenesis, however further studies are required to ascertain it.",

Over the last decades, the importance of actomyosin contractile arrays, which are the key constituents of various morphogenetic processes, has been established for many tissues. Intriguingly, recent studies demonstrate that the microtubule cytoskeleton mediates folding and elongation of the epithelial sheet during Drosophila morphogenesis, placing microtubule mechanics en par with actin-based processes. While these studies establish the importance of both cytoskeletal systems during cell and tissue rearrangements, a mechanistic explanation of their functional hierarchy is currently missing. Here, we dissect the individual roles of these two key generators of mechanical forces during epithelium elongation. We demonstrate that microtubules dictate cell shape changes and actomyosin refines them. Combining experimental and numerical approaches, we find that altering the microtubule and actomyosin functions results in predictable changes in tissue shape. We further show that planar polarized microtubule patterning is independent of cell geometry and actomyosin-based mechanics. These results support a hierarchical mechanism, whereby microtubule-based forces in some epithelial systems prime actomyosin-generated forces.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is the process through which mature male gametes are formed and is necessary for transmission of genetic information. While much work has established how sperm fate is promoted and maintained, less is known about how the sperm morphogenesis program is executed. We previously identified a novel role for the nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor, NHR-23, in promoting C. elegans spermatogenesis. Depletion of NHR-23 along with SPE-44, another transcription factor that promotes spermatogenesis, caused additive phenotypes. Through RNA-seq, we determined that NHR-23 and SPE-44 regulate distinct sets of genes. Depletion of both NHR-23 and SPE-44 produced yet another set of differentially regulated genes. NHR-23- regulated genes are enriched in phosphatases, consistent with the switch in spermatids to post-translational regulation following genome quiescence. In the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum, MFP1 and MFP2 control the polymerization of Major Sperm Protein, the molecule that drives sperm motility and serves as a signal to promote ovulation. NHR-23 and SPE-44 regulate a number of MFP2 paralogs, and NHR-23 depletion caused defective localization of MSD/MFP1 and NSPH-2/MFP2. Although NHR-23 and SPE-44 do not transcriptionally regulate the casein kinase gene spe-6, a key regulator of sperm development, SPE-6 protein is lost following NHR-23+SPE-44 depletion. Together, these experiments provide the first mechanistic insight into how NHR-23 promotes spermatogenesis and an entry point to understanding the synthetic genetic interaction between nhr-23 and spe-44.",

In host-restricted endosymbionts, gene inactivation and genome reduction is facilitated by mobile genetic elements, mainly insertion sequences (ISs). ISs are small autonomous mobile elements, and one of, if not the most, abundant transposable elements in bacteria. Proliferation of ISs is common in some facultative endosymbionts, and is likely driven by the transmission bottlenecks, which increase the level of genetic drift. In the current study we present a manually curated genome annotation for a Cardinium endosymbiont of the dwarf spider Oedothorax gibbosus. Cardinium species are host-restricted endosymbionts that, similarly to Wolbachia spp., include strains capable of manipulating host reproduction. Through the focus on mobile elements, the annotation revealed a rampant spread of ISs, extending earlier observations in other Cardinium genomes. We found that a large proportion of IS elements are actually pseudogenised, with many displaying evidence of recent inactivation. Most notably, we describe the lineage-specific emergence and spread of a novel IS-derived Miniature Inverted repeat Transposable Element (MITE), likely being actively maintained by intact copies of its parental IS982-family element. This work highlights the relevance of manual curation of these repeat-rich endosymbiont genomes for the discovery of novel MITEs, as well as the possible role these understudied elements might play in genome streamlining.",

    "abstract": "Octopamine has broad roles within invertebrate nervous systems as a neurohormone, neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. It orchestrates foraging behavior in many insect taxa via effects on feeding, gustatory responsiveness and appetitive learning. Knowledge of how this biogenic amine regulates bee physiology and behavior is based largely on study of a single species, the honey bee, Apis mellifera. Until recently, its role in the foraging ecology and social organization of diverse bee taxa had been unexplored. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are a model for the study of foraging and learning, and its neural basis, but whether octopamine similarly affects sensory and cognitive performance in this genus is not known. To address this gap, we explored the effects of octopamine on sucrose response thresholds and associative learning in Bombus impatiens via conditioning of the Proboscis Extension Reflex (PER) using a visual (color) cue. We found that octopamine had similar effects on bumble bee behavior as honey bees, however, higher doses were required to induce these effects. At this higher dose, octopamine lowered bees sucrose response thresholds and appeared to enhance associative learning performance. Adding to recent studies on stingless bees (Meliponini), these findings support the idea that octopamines role in reward processing and learning is broadly conserved across Apidae, while pointing towards some differences across systems worth exploring further.",

The Mis18 complex is a licensing factor for new CENP-A deposition via the CENP-A chaperone, Holliday junction recognition protein (HJURP) on the centromere chromatin. Chicken KINETOCHORE NULL2 (KNL2) (ggKNL2), a Mis18 complex component, has a CENP-C-like motif, and our previous study suggested that ggKNL2 directly binds to the CENP-A nucleosome to recruit HJURP/CENP-A to the centromere. However, the molecular basis for CENP-A nucleosome recognition by ggKNK2 remains unclear. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the chicken CENP-A nucleosome in complex with a ggKNL2 fragment containing a CENP-C-like motif. Chicken KNL2 distinguishes between CENP-A and histone H3 in the nucleosome using the CENP-C-like motif and its downstream region. Both the C-terminal tail and RG-loop of CENP-A are simultaneously recognized as CENP-A characteristics. The CENP-A nucleosome-ggKNL2 interaction is thus essential for CENP-A deposition. Furthermore, our structural, biochemical, and cell biology data indicate that ggKNL2 alters its binding partner at the centromere during chicken cell cycle progression.",

    "abstract": "Folding of nascent chains emerging from the ribosome is a challenge in cellular protein homeostasis, which in eukaryotes is met by an Hsp70 chaperone triad directly binding at the ribosomal tunnel exit. The conserved ribosome-associated complex (RAC) consists of the non-canonical Hsp70 Ssz1 and the J-domain protein Zuotin (Zuo1), which in fungi acts together with the canonical Hsp70 protein Ssb. Here, we determined high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of RAC bound to the 80S ribosome. RAC adopts two distinct conformations accommodating continuous ribosomal rotation by a flexible lever arm. The heterodimer is held together by a tight interaction between the Ssz1 substrate-binding domain (SBD) and the N-terminus of Zuo1, with additional contacts between the Ssz1 nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and the Zuo1 J- and ZHD domains that form a rigid unit. The Zuo1 HPD-motif conserved in J-proteins is masked by the Ssz1 NBD, different from the canonical Hsp70 J-protein contact, however, allowing to position Ssb for activation by Zuo1. Our data provide the basis for understanding how RAC cooperates with Ssb at the ribosome in dynamic nascent chain interaction and protein folding.",

Yet few tools are available to control brain immunology in vivo with local precision, and fewer yet are used for therapeutic intervention. 2 Here, we propose engineered cytokines as a neuroimmune-modulation platform. We demonstrate that the residence time of cytokines in the brain can be tuned by binding them to the extracellular matrix or synthetic scaffolds. We then show that the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (alum) is retained in the brain >2 weeks. Tethering of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL) 2 and 12 to alum yields extended neuroinflammation and brain immunosurveillance after intracranial administration, while avoiding systemic toxicity. In mouse models of both immunologically hot and cold brain tumors, the intracranial deposition of alum-tethered cytokines causes significant delay in tumor progression. RNA profiling reveals that engineered cytokines engage both innate and adaptive immunity in the brain. These findings suggest that engineered cytokines can reprogram brain immunosurveillance, informing the development of future therapies for neuroimmune diseases.",

Here, we introduce a fully-enclosed superhydrophobic-based optofluidics system, enabled by a one-step high precision microstereolithography procedure. Various micro-structured cladding designs with a feature size down to 100 m were studied and a \"T-type\" overhang design exhibits the lowest optical loss, regardless of the excitation wavelength. Surprisingly, the optical loss of superhydrophobic-based optofluidics is not solely decided by the solid area fraction at the solid/water/air interface, but also the cross-section shape and the effective cladding layer composition. We show that this fully-enclosed optofluidic system can be used for CRISPR-labeled quantum dot quantification, intended for in vitro and in vivo CRISPR therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Transmural rupture of the aorta is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality; it occurs when wall stress exceeds local wall strength. Amongst other conditions, the aortic root and ascending aorta become vulnerable to dissection and rupture in Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that results in a progressive fragmentation and degradation of the elastic fibers of the aortic wall. Whereas competent elastic fibers are critical for aortic functionality, cross-linked collagen fibers endow the aorta with its stiffness and strength. In this paper, we contrast progressive degeneration of the ascending aorta in male and female Marfan and wild-type mice, with and without chronic exposure to a potent inhibitor of lysyl oxidase ({beta}-aminopropionitrile, or BAPN), to examine effects of extracellular matrix cross-linking in aortic dilatation and rupture. We found a strong sexual dimorphism in aortic dilatation in Marfan mice and aortic rupture in wild-type mice, but also a compensatory remodeling of the aorta that protected the Marfan aorta against lethal rupture despite a strong BAPN challenge. This compensation appears to be mediated via increased lysyl oxidase in the female and especially male Marfan aorta, resulting in improved collagen fiber stability and integrity, particularly of fibril bundles in the adventitia.",

To address this need, we incorporated photonic biosensors for inflammatory cytokines into a model TC. Human bronchial epithelial cells seeded in a microfluidic device were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, and the cytokines secreted in response sensed in real time. Sensing analyte transport through the TC in response to disruption of tissue barrier was also demonstrated. This work demonstrates the first application of photonic sensors to a human TC device, and will enable new applications in drug development and disease modeling.",

Here, we have investigated how chromatin organisation contributes to replication initiation and dynamics by intersecting ChIP-seq, Hi-C, Repli-seq, and OK-seq data from primary and tumour cells lines. We found replication initiation is significantly enriched at TAD boundaries, co-localizing with CTCF and cohesin in early and mid S-phase. Strong replication fork directionality (RFD) from initiation zones in TAD boundaries could occur in a bi- or uni-directional manner, which highly correlated with replication timing. While TAD boundaries were largely invariant, a minority of initiation zones were shared across cell lines, indicative of cell type specific regulation. These data are consistent with chromatin structure organizing replication initiation and dynamics, ensuring orderly completion of replication from TAD boundaries into TAD internal regions.",

In this disease, it is well appreciated that macrophages are immunosuppressive and contribute to the poor response to immunotherapy; however, the mechanisms of immune suppression are complex and not fully understood. Immunosuppressive macrophages are classically defined by expression of the enzyme Arginase 1 (Arg1), which we demonstrated is potently expressed in pancreatic tumor associated macrophages from both human patients and mouse models. While routinely used as a polarization marker, Arg1 also catabolizes arginine, an amino acid required for T cell activation and proliferation. To investigate this metabolic function, we used a genetic and a pharmacologic approach to target Arg1 in pancreatic cancer. Genetic inactivation of Arg1 in macrophages, using a dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer, delayed formation of invasive disease, while increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration. Treatment of established tumors with the arginase inhibitor CB-1158 exhibited further increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, beyond that seen with the macrophage-specific knockout, and sensitized the tumors to anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade. Thus, our data demonstrate that Arg1 is more than simply a marker of macrophage function. Rather, Arg1 is also a driver of immune suppression and represents a promising immunotherapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.",

Here, we investigated how tryptophan deficiencies influence the longevity and behavior of bumble bees. Tryptophan-deficient diets led to a moderate increase in food intake, aggressiveness and mortality compared to the control diet. Vitamin B3 supplementation in tryptophan-deficient diets tended to buffer these effects on food intake and survival, and significantly reduced workers aggressiveness.

    "abstract": "Regenerating functional new neurons in adult mammalian brains has been proven a difficult task for decades. Recent advancement in direct glia-to-neuron conversion in vivo opens a new field for neural regeneration and repair. However, this emerging new field is facing serious challenges from misuse of viral vectors to misinterpretation of conversion data. Here, we employ a variety of AAV vectors with different promoters and enhancers to demonstrate that astrocytes can be converted into neurons in a NeuroD1 dose-dependent manner in both wildtype (WT) and transgenic mice. Notably, astrocytes in WT mice were relatively easy to convert with higher conversion efficiency, whereas lineage-traced astrocytes in Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice showed high resistance to reprogramming but were still converted into neurons after enhancing NeuroD1 expression with CMV enhancer. Furthermore, under two-photon microscope, we observed direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion within 3 weeks of serial live imaging in the mouse cortex. We also demonstrated that high titre AAV reaching 1013 GC/ml caused severe neuronal leakage using a variety of AAV GFAP::GFP vectors, highlighting the necessity to inject low titre AAV into healthy brains to avoid artifactual results. Together, our studies suggest that lineage-traced astrocytes can be converted into neurons but require stronger conversion force such as enhanced NeuroD1 expression. Failure to recognize the difference between WT astrocytes and lineage-traced astrocytes in terms of conversion barrier will lead to misinterpretation of data.",

    "abstract": "Colletotrichum truncatum, the most relevant fungal species associated with soybean anthracnose, is responsible for major losses in the crop. Chemical control via fungicide application is still the most effective strategy for the control of soybean foliar diseases. However, the increase in anthracnose incidence in some regions of Brazil indicates that current chemical control has not been effective against anthracnose. In this study, we assessed the fungicide sensitivity of C. truncatum lineages using isolates representing two important regions of soybean production in Brazil to the fungicides azoxystrobin, thiophanate-methyl, difenoconazole, and fludioxonil. We characterized the molecular resistance to quinone-outside inhibitors (QoI), methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBC) and demethylation inhibitors (DMI) fungicide groups based on amino acid sequences of the cytochrome b (cytb), {beta}-tubulin gene ({beta}-tub), and P450 sterol 14a-demethylases (CYP51) genes. Multiple resistance of C. truncatum isolates to QoI and MBC was observed associated with mutation points in the {beta}-tub (E198A and F200Y) and cytb (G143A). Alternatively, low EC50 values were found for fludioxonil and difenoconazole indicating high efficacy. Analysis of C. truncatum genomes revealed two potential DMI targets, CYP51A and CYP51B, and higher genetic variability in the CYP51A gene. A slight correlation between genetic differentiation of C. truncatum populations and fungicide sensibility was found (Students t-test <0.001). To our knowledge, this is the first report of multiple resistance to QoI and MBC fungicides in C. truncatum in Brazil.\n\nHighlights- Multiple resistance of C. truncatum to azoxystrobin and thiophanate-methyl\n- C. truncatum isolates are sensitive to difenoconazole and fludioxonil\n- Presence of E198A and F200Y {beta}-tubulin mutations and G143A cytochrome b mutation\n- Presence of CYP51A and CYP51B paralogues and higher genetic variability in the CYP51A",
