    "abstract": "BackgroundVentral striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) play a central role in basal ganglia function by regulating associative learning and reward processing. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ChIs regulate glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission. However, it is unclear how ChIs orchestrate the control of these neurotransmitters to determine the excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. Additionally, the effects of binge alcohol drinking on ChIs-mediated modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in NAc MSNs are also undefined.\n\nMethodsWe optogenetically stimulated ChIs while recording evoked and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in D1- and D2-MSN of ChAT.ChR2.eYFPxDrd1.tdtomato mice. To determine the effect of ChIs on mouse behavior and alcohol consumption, we implanted ChAT.ChR2.eYFP mice with fiber optic cannulas and stimulated ChIs while mice were allowed to drink 20% alcohol using the binge alcohol drinking- in-the-dark (DID) paradigm.\n\nResultsWe demonstrated that NAc ChIs decrease the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in both D1- and D2-MSNs. While inhibition of D1-MSNs glutamate release by ChIs depends on dopamine release, that of D2-MSNs results from a direct interactions between ChIs and glutamatergic terminals. Interestingly, after two weeks of binge alcohol drinking, the effect of ChIs stimulation on glutamate release was reversed in D1-MSNs, while its effect on D2-MSNs remained unchanged. Finally, in vivo optogenetic stimulation of NAc ChIs significantly increased alcohol consumption.\n\nConclusionsThese results identify ChIs as a key target for the regulation of NAc circuitry and as a potential treatment of alcohol addiction.",

    "abstract": "Severe stress exposure is a global problem with long-lasting negative behavioral and physiological consequences, increasing the risk of stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). An essential characteristic of MDD is the impairment of social functioning and lack of social motivation. Chronic social defeat stress is an established animal model for MDD research, which induces a cascade of physiological and social behavioral changes. The current developments of markerless pose estimation tools allow for more complex and socially relevant behavioral tests, but the application of these tools to social behavior remains to be explored. Here, we introduce the open-source tool \"DeepOF\" to investigate the individual and social behavioral profile in mice by providing supervised and unsupervised pipelines using DeepLabCut annotated pose estimation data. The supervised pipeline relies on pre-trained classifiers to detect defined traits for both single and dyadic animal behavior. Subsequently, the unsupervised pipeline explores the behavioral repertoire of the animals without label priming, which has the potential of pointing towards previously unrecognized motion motifs that are systematically different across conditions. We here provide evidence that the DeepOF supervised and unsupervised pipelines detect a distinct stress-induced social behavioral pattern, which was particularly observed at the beginning of a novel social encounter. The stress-induced social behavior shows a state of arousal that fades with time due to habituation. In addition, while the classical social avoidance task does identify the stress-induced social behavioral differences, both DeepOF behavioral pipelines provide a clearer and more detailed profile. DeepOF aims to facilitate reproducibility and unification of behavioral classification of social behavior by providing an open-source tool, which can significantly advance the study of rodent individual and social behavior, thereby enabling novel biological insights as well as drug development for psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Unbiased genetic screens implicated a number of uncharacterized genes in hearing loss, suggesting some biological processes required for auditory function remain unexplored. Loss of Kiaa1024L/Minar2, a previously understudied gene, caused deafness in mice, but how it functioned in hearing was unclear. Here we show that disruption of kiaa1024L/minar2 causes hearing loss in the zebrafish. Defects in mechanotransduction, longer and thinner hair bundles, and enlarged apical lysosomes in hair cells are observed in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. In cultured cells, Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is mainly localized to lysosomes and its overexpression recruits cholesterol and increases cholesterol labeling. Strikingly, an accessible pool of cholesterol is highly enriched in the hair bundle membrane, and loss of kiaa1024L/minar2 reduces cholesterol localization to the hair bundles. Decreasing cholesterol levels aggravates, while increasing cholesterol levels rescues hair cell defects in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. Therefore cholesterol plays an essential role in the hair bundles, and Kiaa1024L/Minar2 regulates cholesterol distribution and homeostasis to ensure normal hearing.",

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) overlays computer-generated visual, auditory or other sensory information on the real world. Due to recent advancements in AR it can be difficult for the user to differentiate between sensory information coming from real and virtual objects, leading to interesting phenomena. For example, an AR experience in which users can experience their own hands in flames has been shown to elicit heat illusions on the affected hands. In this study, we investigate the potential that AR has for top-down modulation of pain and thermal perception. We assessed thermal pain and detection thresholds on the participants right hand when they experienced that hand covered in virtual flames in AR. We compared that experience to a baseline condition with no additional stimuli as well to a control condition that sees the hand covered by unrealistic blue flames to compensate the distraction factor. We found that experiencing a burning hand in AR induced analgesic and hyperalgesic effects as participants began to feel heat related pain on lower temperatures and cold related pain on higher temperatures. That experience also significantly changed the lowest temperature at which participants started perceiving warmth. These results demonstrate that pain and thermal perception can be manipulated by altering the perception of our body in AR.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy, the condition of recurrent unprovoked seizures resulting from a wide variety of causes, is one of the worlds most prominent brain syndrome. Seizures which are an expression of neuronal network dysfunction occur in a positive feedback loop of concomitant factors where seizures generate more seizures, including also neuro-inflammatory responses. Among other pathways involved in inflammatory responses, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway has been proposed to prevent epilepsy. In this work we tested on a model of temporal lobe epilepsy in-vitro, the hypothesis that acute inhibition of STAT3-phosphorylation - during epileptogenesis, can prevent structural damages in the hippocampal circuits, and the imprinting both of neural epileptic activity and inflammatory glial states. We performed calcium imaging of spontaneous circuits dynamics in organotypic hippocampal slices previously exposed to hyper-excitable conditions through the blockage of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Epileptogenic conditions lead to imprinted epileptic dynamics in the circuits in terms of higher frequency of neuronal firing and circuits synchronizations, higher correlated activity in neuronal pairs and decreased complexity in synchronization patterns. Acute inhibition of the STAT3-phosphorylation during epileptogenesis, prevented the imprinting of epileptic activity patterns, general cell loss, GABAergic cells loss and the persistence of inflammatory reactive glial states. This work provides further evidence that inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway under epileptogenesis can prevent patho-topological reorganization of neuro-glial circuits.",

    "abstract": "Demyelination, the loss of the insulating sheath of neurons, causes failed or slowed neuronal conduction and contributes to the neurological symptoms in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, stroke, and dementia. In demyelinated neurons, the axonal potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, generally under the myelin sheath, become exposed and upregulated. Therefore, imaging these channels using positron emission tomography can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Here, we describe the novel tracer for Kv1 channels [11C]3-methyl-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3Me4AP). [11C]3Me4AP was efficiently synthesized via Pd(0)-Cu(I) co-mediated Stille cross-coupling of a stannyl precursor containing a free amino group. Evaluation of its imaging properties in rats and nonhuman primates showed that [11C]3Me4AP has a moderate brain permeability and slow kinetics. Additional evaluation in monkeys showed that the tracer is metabolically stable and that a 1-tissue compartment model can accurately model the regional brain time-activity curves. Compared to the related tracers [18F]3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine ([18F]3F4AP) and [11C]3-methoxy-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3MeO4AP), [11C]3Me4AP shows lower initial brain uptake, which indicates reduced permeability to the blood-brain-barrier and slower kinetics, suggesting higher binding affinity consistent with in vitro studies. While the slow kinetics and strong binding affinity resulted in a tracer with less favorable properties for imaging the brain than its predecessors, these properties may make 3Me4AP useful as a therapeutic.",

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of pruritogen-induced mechanical itch sensitization are poorly understood. Here we show that intradermal injections of histamine or chloroquine (CQ) provoke alloknesis through activation of TRPV1- and MrgprA3- expressing prurioceptors, and functional ablation of these neurons reverses pruritogen-induced alloknesis. Moreover, genetic ablation of mechanosensitive Piezo2 channel function from MrgprA3-expressing prurioceptors also dampens pruritogen-induced alloknesis. Mechanistically, histamine and CQ sensitize Piezo2 channel function through activation of the PLC-PKC{delta} signaling. Collectively, our data uncovered a TRPV1+/MrgprA3+ prurioceptor-Piezo2 signaling axis in the initiation of pruritogen-induced mechanical itch sensitization in the skin.",

    "abstract": "An important function of the visual system is to represent 3D scene structure from a sequence of 2D images projected onto the retinae. During observer translation, the relative image motion of stationary objects at different distances (motion parallax) provides potent depth information. However, if an object moves relative to the scene, this complicates the computation of depth from motion parallax since there will be an additional component of image motion related to scene-relative object motion. To correctly compute depth from motion parallax, only the component of image motion caused by self-motion should be used by the brain. Previous experimental and theoretical work on perception of depth from motion parallax has assumed that objects are stationary in the world. Thus, it is unknown whether perceived depth based on motion parallax is biased by object motion relative to the scene.\n\nNaive human subjects viewed a virtual 3D scene consisting of a ground plane and stationary background objects, while lateral self-motion was simulated by optic flow. A target object could be either stationary or moving laterally at different velocities, and subjects were asked to judge the depth of the object relative to the plane of fixation. Subjects showed a far bias when object and observer moved in the same direction, and a near bias when object and observer moved in opposite directions. This pattern of biases is expected if subjects confound image motion due to self-motion with that due to scene-relative object motion. These biases were large when the object was viewed monocularly, and were greatly reduced, but not eliminated, when binocular disparity cues were provided. Our findings establish that scene-relative object motion can confound perceptual judgements of depth during self-motion.",

    "abstract": "Objects are fundamental to scene understanding. Scenes are defined by embedded objects and how we interact with them. Paradoxically, scene processing in the brain is typically discussed in contrast to object processing. Using the BOLD5000 dataset (Chang et al., 2019), we examined whether objects within a scene predicted the neural representation of scenes, as measured by fMRI in humans. Stimuli included 1,179 unique scenes across 18 semantic categories. Object composition of scenes were compared across scene exemplars in different semantic categories, and separately, in exemplars of the same category. Neural representations in scene- and object-preferring brain regions were significantly related to which objects were in a scene, with the effect at times stronger in the scene-preferring regions. The object model accounted for more variance when comparing scenes within the same semantic category to scenes from different categories. Thus, the functional role of scene-preferring regions should include the processing of objects. This suggests visual processing regions may be better characterized with respect to which processes are engaged when interacting with the stimulus category, such as processing groups of objects in scenes, or processing a single object in our foreground, rather than the stimulus category itself.",

    "abstract": "The brain interprets sensory inputs to guide behavior, but behavior disrupts sensory inputs. In primates, saccadic eye movements displace visual images on the retina and yet the brain perceives visual stability, a process called active vision. We studied whether active vision is Bayesian. Humans and monkeys reported whether an image moved during saccades. We tested whether they used prior expectations to account for sensory uncertainty in a Bayesian manner. For continuous judgments, subjects were Bayesian. For categorical judgments, they were anti-Bayesian for uncertainty due to external, image noise but Bayesian for uncertainty due to internal, motor-driven noise. A discriminative learning model explained the anti-Bayesian effect. Therefore, active vision uses both Bayesian and discriminative models depending on task requirements (continuous vs. categorical) and the source of uncertainty (image noise vs. motor-driven noise), suggesting that active perceptual mechanisms are governed by the interaction of both models.",

We identified concordantly and discordantly expressed gene modules and performed in silico cell deconvolution. A high degree of concordance of gene expression between both adult and paediatric in vivo-in vitro tuberculosis infection was identified. Concordance in paediatric in vivo vs in vitro comparison is largely characterised by immune suppression, while in adults the comparison is marked by concordant immune activation, particularly that of inflammation, chemokine, and interferon signalling. Discordance between in vitro and in vivo increases over time and is driven by T-cell regulation and monocyte-related gene expression, likely due to apoptotic depletion of monocytes and increasing relative fraction of longer-lived cell types, such as T and B cells. Our approach facilitates a more informed use of the whole blood in vitro model, while also accounting for its limitations.",

Timelapse imaging microscopy in nanowell grids (TIMING) profiling revealed that T cells from responders showed migration (persistent motion for at least one body length), and migration was associated with serial killing capacity. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed that migration is linearly correlated with both mitochondrial volume and lysosomal volume; and scRNA-seq demonstrated that T cells from responders were enriched in pathways related to T-cell killing, migration and actin cytoskeleton, and TCR clustering. A marker-free sorting strategy enriched T cells with migratory capacity and validated serial killing, bioenergetics, and in vivo efficacy. In aggregate, we demonstrate that migration is a cell-intrinsic biomarker independent of CAR design or biomanufacturing, desired in the bioactivity of CAR+ T cells associated with clinical antitumor efficacy.",

Here, we identify the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Rin-like (Rinl) as a negative regulator of Tfh generation. Loss of Rinl leads to an increase of Tfh in aging, upon in vivo immunization and acute LCMV Armstrong infection in mice, and in human CD4+ T cell in vitro cultures. Further, adoptive transfer experiments using WT and Rinl-KO naive CD4+ T cells unraveled T cell-intrinsic functions of Rinl. Mechanistically, Rinl regulates CD28 internalization and signaling, thereby shaping CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation. Thus, our results identify the GEF Rinl as a negative regulator of global Tfh differentiation in an immunological context and species-independent manner, and furthermore connect Rinl with CD28 internalization and signaling pathways in CD4+ T cells, demonstrating for the first-time the importance of endocytic processes for Tfh differentiation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRinl-KO CD4+ T cells show increased Tfh differentiation in a context independent manner\nC_LIO_LIThe regulation of Tfh differentiation is T cell-intrinsic\nC_LIO_LIRinl controls CD28 endocytosis and shapes Tfh-specific CD28 signal transduction\nC_LIO_LIHuman Tfh differentiation is regulated by Rinl\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ICOS/ICOSL and CD28/B7-1/B7-2 are T cell co-stimulators and CTLA-4 is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that play critical roles in the pathogenesis of neoplasia. Chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is induced in many cancers where it portends a poor prognosis and contributes to tumor metastasis. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 inhibits the expression of ICOS, ICOSL and CD28 while stimulating CTLA-4 and the B7 moieties in melanoma lung metastasis. We also demonstrate that RIG-like helicase innate immune activation augments T cell co-stimulation, inhibits CTLA-4 and suppresses pulmonary metastasis. At least additive antitumor responses were seen in melanoma lung metastasis treated with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-CHI3L1 antibodies in combination. Synergistic cytotoxic T cell-induced tumor cell death and the heightened induction of the tumor suppressor PTEN were seen in co-cultures of T and tumor cells treated with bispecific antibodies that target both CHI3L1 and CTLA-4. Thus, CHI3L1 contributes to pulmonary metastasis by inhibiting T cell co-stimulation and stimulating CTLA-4. The simultaneous targeting of CHI3L1 and the CTLA-4 axis with individual and, more powerfully with bispecific antibodies, represent promising therapeutic strategies for pulmonary metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical loading is critical for collagen network maintenance and remodelling in adult skeletal tissues, but the role of loading in collagen network formation during development is poorly understood. We test the hypothesis that mechanical loading is necessary for the onset and maturation of spatial localisation and structure of collagens in prenatal cartilage and bone, using in vivo and in vitro mouse models of altered loading. The majority of collagens studied were aberrant in structure or localisation, or both, when skeletal muscle was absent in vivo. Using in vitro bioreactor culture system, we demonstrate that mechanical loading directly modulates the spatial localisation and structure of collagens II and X. Furthermore, we show that mechanical loading in vitro rescues aspects of collagens II and X development from the effects of fetal immobility. In conclusion, our findings show that mechanical loading is a critical determinant of collagen network establishment during prenatal skeletal development.\n\nTeaser (One line)Mechanical loading is required for normal establishment and maturation of key collagens during prenatal skeletal development.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila ovarian Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs) present a favorable paradigm for understanding how stem cell division and differentiation are balanced in communities where they can be regulated independently. Many key extracellular signals for FSCs have been identified, including inversely graded Wnt and JAK-STAT pathway activators. FSCs also exhibit interesting functional spatial heterogeneity; posterior FSCs become proliferative Follicle Cells, while anterior FSCs become quiescent Escort Cells at a much lower rate. Here, by using live imaging and FUCCI cell-cycle reporters, we measured absolute division rates and found that posterior FSCs cycle 3-4 times faster than their anterior neighbors, matching their increased differentiation rate. We also found evidence for FSC G2/M cycling restrictions and G1/S restriction that increases more anteriorly, especially beyond the FSC domain. JAK-STAT signaling promotes both transitions but graded JAK-STAT signaling alone does not explain the graded cycling of FSCs. Genetic interaction tests and FUCCI reporter assays suggest that JAK-STAT signaling acts partly through Yorkie and can largely substitute for stimulation of division by Hh signaling. PI3 kinase signaling, in contrast to Hh signaling, acts largely independently of Yorkie induction and stimulates the G2/M transition.",

    "abstract": "Priming is the process through which periodic elevations in auxin signalling prepattern future sites for lateral root formation, called prebranch sites. Thusfar is has remained a matter of debate to what extent elevations in auxin concentration and/or auxin signalling are critical for priming and prebranch site formation. Recently, we discovered a reflux-and-growth mechanism for priming generating periodic elevations in auxin concentration that subsequently dissipate. Here we reverse engineer a mechanism for prebranch site formation that translates these transient elevations into a persistent increase in auxin signalling, resolving the prior debate into a two-step process of auxin concentration mediated initial signal and auxin signalling capacity mediated memorization. A critical aspect of the prebranch site formation mechanism is its activation in response to time integrated rather than instantaneous auxin signalling. The proposed mechanism is demonstrated to be consistent with prebranch site auxin signalling dynamics, lateral inhibition and symmetry breaking mechanisms and perturbations in auxin homeostasis.\n\nSummary statementUsing computational modeling we reveal the likely complementary roles of auxin and auxin signalling in one of the earliest step in the formation of plant lateral roots, prebranch site formation.",

SHP1 missense and splice site mutations are associated with neutrophilic dermatoses and emphysema in humans, which resembles the phenotype seen in mice that lack functional SHP1 partially. Complete lack of SHP1 function in mouse motheaten mutants leads to severe defects and lethality at 2-6 weeks after birth. Here, we investigated the function of Shp1 in developing zebrafish embryos. We generated a ptpn6 knockout zebrafish line lacking functional Shp1. Zebrafish develop ex utero and are transparent, which facilitates analysis of the function of Shp1 during early hematopoietic development. Shp1 knockout caused severe inflammation and lethality around 17 days post fertilization (dpf). During early development the myeloid lineage was affected, which resulted in a decrease in the number of neutrophils, and a concomitant increase in the number of macrophages. The number of emerging hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) was decreased, but due to hyperproliferation, the number of HSPCs was higher in ptpn6 mutants than in siblings at 5 dpf. Finally, directional migration of neutrophils and macrophages was decreased in response to wounding and less macrophages were recruited to the wound site. Yet, regeneration of the caudal fin fold was normal. We conclude that loss of Shp1 impairs neutrophil and macrophage function and caused severe inflammation and lethality at the larval stage.",

    "abstract": "Biophysical cues are essential for guiding skeletal development, but the mechanisms underlying the physical regulation of cartilage and bone formation are unknown. TRPV4 is a cell membrane ion channel responsible for transducing mechanical stimuli as a means of regulating skeletal cell homeostatic processes. Dysregulation of TRPV4 is associated with several skeletal developmental pathologies, indicating its involvement in cartilage and bone development, potentially in a mechanosensing capacity. In this study, we test the hypothesis that mechanically mediated prenatal skeletogenesis depends on TRPV4 activity. We first validate a novel model where we establish that dynamically loading embryonic mouse hindlimb explants cultured ex vivo promotes joint cartilage growth and morphogenesis, but not diaphyseal mineralization. We next reveal that TRPV4 protein expression is mechanically regulated and spatially localized to patterns of high biophysical stimuli in the femoral condyles of cultured limbs. Finally, we demonstrate that TRPV4 activity is crucial for the mechanical regulation of joint cartilage growth and shape, mediated via the control of cell proliferation and matrix biosynthesis, indicating a mechanism by which mechanical loading could direct morphogenesis during joint formation. We conclude that the regulatory pathways initiated by TRPV4 mechanotransduction are essential for the for the cartilage response to physical stimuli during skeletal development. Therefore, TRPV4 may be a valuable target for the development of therapeutic skeletal disease modifying drugs and developmentally-inspired tissue engineering strategies for skeletal repair.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 (FBFs) are required for germline stem cell maintenance and the sperm/oocyte switch in Caenorhabditis elegans, though the mechanisms controlling FBF protein levels remain unknown. We identified an interaction between both FBFs and CSN-5, a component of the COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome. Here, we find that the MPN (Mpr1/Pad1 N terminal) metalloprotease domain of CSN-5 interacts with the PUF (Pumilio and FBF) RNA-binding domain of FBFs and the interaction is conserved for human homologs PUM1 and CSN5. The interaction between FBF-2 and CSN-5 can be detected in vivo by proximity ligation. csn-5 mutation results in destabilization of FBF proteins, a decrease in the numbers of germline stem cells, and disruption of the switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis. The loss of csn-5 does not decrease the levels of a related PUF protein PUF-3 and csn-5(lf) phenotype is not enhanced by fbf-1/2 depletion, suggesting that the effect is specific to FBFs. The effect of csn-5 on germline sex determination is largely independent of the COP9 signalosome and is cell autonomous. Surprisingly, regulation of FBF protein levels involves a combination of COP9-dependent and -independent mechanisms differentially affecting FBF-1 and FBF-2. This work supports a previously unappreciated role for CSN-5 in stabilization of germline stem cell regulatory proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2.\n\nAuthor SummaryGerm cell development and reproductive success in the nematode C. elegans rely on the function of germline stem cells. Continued maintenance of these cells is supported by the activity of conserved RNA-binding proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 (FBFs). However, it is unknown how FBF protein levels are regulated. Here, we identify a direct interaction between FBFs and CSN-5, a component of the COP9 signalosome best known for its role in regulating protein degradation. We find that CSN-5 promotes FBF stability and allows for accumulation of steady-state protein levels, thereby promoting FBF function. In csn-5 mutants, we find a significant reduction of FBF proteins, decrease of stem cells, and failure to promote oogenesis consistent with compromised FBF function. Furthermore, CSN-5 contributes to FBF protein stability through two mechanisms. This work demonstrates a previously unappreciated role for CSN-5 in stabilization of FBF proteins. Based on our finding that the FBF/CSN-5 interaction is conserved and detectable between homologous human proteins, we speculate this relationship might be relevant for understanding stem cell maintenance in a range of species, from nematodes to humans.",

    "abstract": "The Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius, L. 1758) is the largest primary cavity excavator in Western Europe. Its cavities represent an essential microhabitat for many other forest species and the landscape factors linked with cavity excavation by the Black Woodpecker are needed to support the conservation of this species. Such relationships should thus be quantified at the scale of the home range in Western Europe.\n\nWe used cavity maps by foresters and naturalists to build a large (2689 cavity bearing trees) database distributed over 11 sites in France. Based on this and on a set of background points, we analysed the effects of stand composition and landscape features (forest cover, landscape connectivity and fragmentation) at three different scales around each plot corresponding to a forest management unit (10ha), the core (100ha) and extended (250ha) home range scales.\n\nWe showed that landscape shape index and forest composition (especially the presence of mixed forests) had significant effects but that the magnitude varied across the three scales. We notably observed the strongest effects at the core home range scale (100ha), indicating that Black Woodpecker requirements for cavity excavation are more pronounced at this scale. The Black Woodpecker tend to avoid conifer-dominated stands to excavate cavities, but benefits from mixed forests, that couple favourable foraging and cavity excavation sites. The bird also prefers continuous forest landscapes with low edge densities. We also showed that effects of landscape were stronger in wetter climates and higher slopes, indicating context-dependence.\n\nForest planning rarely integrates the landscape patterns in western temperate Europe, a better understanding of the features linked with cavity excavation by the Black Woodpecker may hence help to better integrate their conservation in forest management planning. Our results also show the importance to maintain mixed broadleaf-conifer forests as well as continuous and well-connected forest landscapes to favour features that benefit secondary cavity nesters at the large scale.",

We test the method in two well-studied systems. Butterflies are known to be strongly responding to climate change, and we show that over 21 years the codistribution component declines for butterfly communities in southern England.

    "abstract": "Haplodiploidy and paternal genome elimination (PGE) are examples of asymmetric inheritance, where males transmit only maternally inherited chromosomes to their offspring. Under haplodiploidy this results from males being haploid, whereas under PGE males inherit but subsequently eliminate paternally inherited chromosomes during meiosis. Their evolution involves changes in the mechanisms of meiosis and sex determination, and sometimes also dosage compensation. As a result, these systems are thought to be an evolutionary trap, meaning that once asymmetric chromosome transmission evolves, it is difficult to transition back to typical Mendelian transmission. We assess whether there is evidence for this idea in the scale insect family Eriococcidae, a lineage with PGE and the only clade with a suggestion that asymmetric inheritance has transitioned back to Mendelian inheritance. We conduct a cytological survey of 13 eriococcid species, and a cytological, genetic, and gene expression analysis of species in the genus Cystococcus, to investigate whether there is evidence for species in this clade evolving Mendelian chromosome transmission. Although we find that all species we examined exhibit PGE, the mechanism is extremely variable within Eriococcidae. Within Cystococcus, in fact, we uncover a previously undiscovered type of PGE in scale insects, where in males paternally inherited chromosomes are present, uncondensed, and expressed in somatic cells, but are eliminated prior to meiosis. Broadly, we fail to find evidence for a reversion from PGE to Mendelian inheritance in Eriococcidae, supporting the idea that asymmetric inheritance systems such as PGE may be an evolutionary trap.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPolystomatidae represents a monogenean group whose representatives infect mainly (semi)-aquatic tetrapods. Sphyranuridae with its single genus (Sphyranura) exhibits ectoparasitism on salamander hosts and was traditionally considered a sister-group to Polystomatidae based on the presence of a well-developed opisthaptor yet was distinguished due to the presence of a single pair of haptoral suckers, as opposed to the three pairs present in polystomatids. However, more recent molecular work supported its inclusion within Polystomatidae, at an early diverging, yet unresolved, position in the clade of polystomatids that otherwise exhibit endoparasitism of batrachians. Resolving the position of Sphyranura in relation to Polystomatidae is a prerequisite for understanding the factors driving evolution and the shifts between ecto- and endoparasitism in Polystomatidae.\n\nMethodsVarious staining methods were used to morphologically characterise collected specimens of Sphyranura. The mitochondrial genome was assembled from WGS data. Based on a combination of nuclear (18S, 28S rRNA) and mitochondrial markers (cox1, 12S) we inferred the phylogeny of Polystomatidae using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods.\n\nResultsBased on morphological examination and comparison with type material, specimens of Sphyranura infecting Oklahoma salamander (Eurycea tynerensis) at Greathouse Spring, Arkansas (USA), were identified as S. euryceae, a new distributional record for the species. Along with an amended diagnosis of Sphyranura we provide the first molecular data for S. euryceae. Mitochondrial level comparison reveals instances of tRNA gene rearrangements in polystomatids. Our phylogeny identifies two clades within polystomatids infecting tetrapods, one infecting exclusively batrachians, the other mainly known from chelonians. Although not fully supported, Sphyranura appears as the earliest branching lineage within the former.\n\nConclusionsWith Sphyranura nested within Polystomatidae, we consider Sphyranuridae invalid. Sphyranuras apparent early branching position indicates ectoparasitism is an ancestral trait with endoparasitism having evolved later in the  Polbatrach clade. However, the reduced number of haptoral suckers in representatives of Sphyranura is a derived characteristic potentially resulting from paedomorphic evolution. Whilst there is an indication towards phylogenetic congruence of polystomatids and their batrachian hosts, the same was not true for polystomatid parasites of chelonians with evidence of multiple host switches. Furthermore, geographic distribution of hosts was not found to drive polystomatid phylogeny.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of sequence-specific transcription factors clearly drives lineage-specific innovations, but less is known about how changes in the central transcriptional machinery may contribute to evolutionary transformations. In particular, transcriptional regulators are rich in intrinsically disordered regions that appear to be magnets for evolutionary innovation. The C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP) is a transcriptional corepressor derived from an ancestral lineage of alpha hydroxyacid dehydrogenases; it is found in mammals and invertebrates, and features a core NAD-binding domain as well as an unstructured C-terminus (CTD) of unknown function. CtBP can act on promoters and enhancers to repress transcription through chromatin-linked mechanisms. Our comparative phylogenetic study shows that CtBP is a bilaterian innovation whose CTD of about 100 residues is present in almost all orthologs. CtBP CTDs contain conserved blocks of residues and retain a predicted disordered property, despite having variations in the primary sequence. Interestingly, the structure of the C-terminus has undergone radical transformation independently in certain lineages including flatworms and nematodes. Also contributing to CTD diversity is the production of myriad alternative RNA splicing products, including the production of \"short\" tailless forms of CtBP in Drosophila. Additional diversity stems from multiple gene duplications in vertebrates, where up to five CtBP orthologs have been observed. Vertebrate lineages show fewer major modifications in the unstructured CTD, possibly because gene regulatory constraints of the vertebrate body plan place specific constraints on this domain. Our study highlights the rich regulatory potential of this previously unstudied domain of a central transcriptional regulator.",

    "abstract": "Scaling between specific organs and overall body size has long fascinated biologists because they are a primary mechanism through which organismal shapes evolve. Yet, the genetic mechanisms that underlie the evolution of allometries remain elusive. Here we measured wings and tibia lengths in four Drosophila species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. ananassae, and D. virilis) and show that the first three of them follow a single evolutionary allometry. However, D. virilis exhibits a divergent wing-to-tibia allometry due to a dramatic underscaling of their wings with respect to their bodies compared to the other species. We asked whether the evolution of this scaling relationship could be explained by changes in a specific cis-regulatory regulatory region of the wing selector gene, vestigial (vg), whose function is broadly conserved in insects and its expression pattern determines wing size in D. melanogaster. To test this hypothesis directly, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to replace the DNA sequence of the predicted Quadrant Enhancer (vgQE) from D. virilis for the corresponding vgQE sequence in the genome of D. melanogaster. Strikingly, we discovered that D. melanogaster flies carrying the D. virilis vgQE sequence have wings that are much smaller with respect to controls, partially rescuing the wing-to-tibia ratio observed in D. virilis. Our results show that this cis-regulatory element in D. virilis contributes to the underscaling of wings in this species. This provides evidence that scaling relationships may be unconstrained and may evolve gradually through genetic variations in cis-regulatory elements.\n\nSummary statementUsing CRISPR/Cas9 replacement of a cis-regulatory element, this study suggests that changes within the vestigial Quadrant Enhancer sequence are responsible for the evolution of wing allometries in Drosophila species.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of the factors shaping spatial genetic structure in widespread plant species are important for understanding evolutionary history and local adaptation and have applied significance for guiding conservation and restoration decisions. Thurbers needlegrass (Achnatherum thurberianum) is a widespread, locally abundant grass that inhabits heterogeneous arid environments of western North America and is of restoration significance. It is a common component of shrubland steppe communities in the Great Basin Desert, where drought, fire, and invasive grasses have degraded natural communities. Using a reduced representation sequencing approach, we generated SNP data at 5,677 loci across 246 individuals from 17 A. thurberianum populations spanning five previously delineated seed zones from the western Great Basin. Analyses revealed pronounced population genetic structure, with individuals forming consistent geographical clusters across a variety of population genetic analyses and spatial scales. Low levels of genetic diversity within populations, as well as high population estimates of linkage disequilibrium and inbreeding, were consistent with self-fertilization as a contributor to population differentiation. Moreover, variance partitioning and partial RDA indicated local adaptation to the environment as an additional factor influencing the spatial distribution of genetic variation. The environmental variables driving these results were similar to those implicated in recent genecological work which inferred local adaptation in order to delineate seed zones. However, our analyses also reveal a complex evolutionary history of A. thurberanium in the Great Basin, where previously delineated seed zones contain distantly related populations. Overall, our results indicate that numerous factors shape genetic variation in A. thurberianum and that evolutionary history, along with differentiation across distinct geographic and environmental scales, should be considered for conservation and restoration plans.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the adaptation of populations to a changing environment is crucial to assess the impact of human activities on biodiversity. Many theoretical studies have tackled this issue by modeling the evolution of quantitative traits subject to stabilizing selection around an optimal phenotype, whose value is shifted continuously through time. In this context, the population fate results from the equilibrium distribution of the trait, relative to the moving optimum. Such a distribution may vary with the shape of selection, the system of reproduction, the number of loci, the mutation kernel or their interactions. Here, we develop a methodology that provides quantitative measures of population maladaptation and potential of survival directly from the entire profile of the phenotypic distribution, without any a priori on its shape. We investigate two different systems of reproduction (asexual and infinitesimal sexual models of inheritance), with various forms of selection. In particular, we recover that fitness functions such that selection weakens away from the optimum lead to evolutionary tipping points, with an abrupt collapse of the population when the speed of environmental change is too high. Our unified framework allows deciphering the mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon. More generally, it allows discussing similarities and discrepancies between the two systems of reproduction, which are ultimately explained by different constraints on the evolution of the phenotypic variance. We demonstrate that the mean fitness in the population crucially depends on the shape of the selection function in the infinitesimal sexual model, in contrast with the asexual model. In the asexual model, we also investigate the effect of the mutation kernel and we show that kernels with higher kurtosis tend to reduce maladaptation and improve fitness, especially in fast changing environments.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAdaptation to a changing environment may generate non Normal phenotypic distribution.\nC_LIO_LIThe phenotypic variance at equilibrium truly depends on reproduction model;\nC_LIO_LISelection shapes mean fitness only in sexual infinitesimal model;\nC_LIO_LIWeak selection away from the optimum leads to evolutionary tipping points with fast changes;\nC_LIO_LIFrequent mutations with large effects reduce maladaptation and improve fitness.\nC_LI",

Canavanine-resistance mutation rates are broadly similar to those seen with reversion of the ade-485 mutation to adenine prototrophy, but lower than 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA)-resistance rates (inactivation of ura4+ or ura5+ genes). Inactivation of several genes has been associated with canavanine-resistance in S. pombe but surprisingly whole genome sequencing showed that 8/8 spontaneous canavanine-resistance mutants have an R175C mutation in the any1/arn1 gene. This gene encodes a {beta}-arrestin-like protein involved in mediating Pub1 ubiquitylation of target proteins, and the phenotypic resistance to canavanine by this single mutation is similar to that shown by the original \"can1-1\" strain, which also has the any1R175C mutation. Some of the spontaneous mutants have additional mutations in arginine transporters, suggesting that this may marginally increase resistance to canavanine. The any1R175C strain showed internalisation of the Cat1 arginine transporter, explaining the canavanine-resistance phenotype. In addition, any1R175C cells were elongated compared to wild type. The mitotic activator Cdc25 has been identified as a Pub1 ubiquitylation target, and since Wee1 inhibition of Cdc2 is counteracted by Cdc25, it is likely that Cdc25 ubiquitylation and downregulation by Any1R175C-Pub1 delays mitotic entry",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe basis of Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) genetic risk has been well documented; however, few studies have looked at genetic biomarkers of disease progression or treatment response within advanced AMD patients. Here we report the first genome-wide analysis of genetic determinants of low-luminance vision deficit (LLD), which is seen as predictive of visual acuity loss and anti-VEGF treatment response in neovascular AMD patients.\n\nMethodsAMD patients were separated into small- and large-LLD groups for comparison and whole genome sequencing was performed. Genetic determinants of LLD were assessed by common and rare variant genetic analysis. Follow-up functional analysis of rare coding variants identified by the burden test was then performed in vitro.\n\nResultsWe identified four coding variants in the CIDEC gene. These rare variants were only present in patients with a small LLD, which has been previously shown to indicate better prognosis and better treatment response. Our in vitro functional characterization of these CIDEC alleles revealed that all decrease the binding affinity between CIDEC and the lipid droplet fusion effectors PLIN1, RAB8A and AS160. The rare CIDEC alleles all cause a hypomorphic defect in lipid droplet fusion and enlargement, resulting in a decreased fat storage capability in adipocytes.\n\nConclusionsAs we did not detect CIDEC expression in the ocular tissue affected by AMD, our results suggest that the CIDEC variants do not play a direct role in the eye and influence low-luminance vision deficit via an indirect and systemic effect related to fat storage capacity.\n\nFundingNo external funding was received for this work.",

MoBa contains numerous interrelated families, which necessitated the implementation of a family-based quality control (QC) pipeline that verifies and accounts for diverse types of relatedness.\n\nMethodsThe MoBaPsychGen pipeline, comprising pre-imputation QC, phasing, imputation, and post-imputation QC, was developed based on current best-practice protocols and implemented to account for the complex structure of the MoBa genotype data. The pipeline includes QC on both single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and individual level. Phasing and imputation were performed using the publicly available Haplotype Reference Consortium release 1.1 panel as a reference. Information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and MoBa questionnaires were used to identify biological sex, year of birth, reported parent-offspring (PO) relationships, and multiple births (only available in the offspring generation).\n\nResultsIn total, 207,569 unique individuals (90% of the unique individuals included in the study) and 6,981,748 SNPs passed the MoBaPsychGen pipeline. The relatedness checks performed throughout the pipeline allowed identification of within-generation and across-generation first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree relatives. The individuals passing post-imputation QC comprised 64,471 families ranging in size from singletons to 84 unique individuals (singletons are included as families as other family members may not have been genotyped, imputed, or passed post-imputation QC). The relationships identified include 287 monozygotic twin pairs, 22,884 full siblings, 117,004 PO pairs, 23,299 second-degree relative pairs, and 10,828 third-degree relative pairs.\n\nDiscussionMoBa contains a highly complex relatedness structure, with a variety of family structures including singletons, PO duos, full (mother, father, child) PO trios, nuclear families, blended families, and extended families. The availability of robustly quality-controlled genetic data for such a large cohort with a unique extended family structure will allow many novel research questions to be addressed.

We aimed to identify the functional role of CHCs of two riodinid caterpillar species that obligately associate with different multitrophic ant-plant symbioses. Experiments of ant acceptance of caterpillars showed the concerted action of larval-ant-organs that produce liquid rewards (tentacle nectary organs, TNOs) and luring signals (anterior tentacle organs, ATOs) was key to ant appeasement and larval survival. Experiments changing the symbiosis were often lethal for the caterpillars, mainly after emptying the secretions of their TNOs and their ATOs were never activated. Chemical profiles of caterpillars were insignificant. Field bioassays with chemically insignificant palatable insect prey attracted fewer ants, indicating that insignificant cues may reduce the probability of ant attacks. Thus, caterpillars control the emission of signals of ant-organs during symbiosis, whereas the cues of CHCs are silenced. It is possible that a trade-off exists between signals under control and non-controlled cues. Chemical insignificance may allow for a crucial period for caterpillars to make tactical decisions to appease aggressive ants and could be extended to other communication channels according to the sensorial universe of the receiver.",

    "abstract": "Repeated social interactions with conspecifics and/or heterospecifics during early development may drive the differentiation of behaviour among individuals. This behavioural differentiation may occur through individuals behaving more different from each other on average and/or individuals behaving more consistently. Competition is a major form of social interaction and its impacts can depend on whether interactions occur between conspecifics or heterospecifics and the directionality of a response could be specific to different behavioural traits. To test this, we reared tungara frog tadpoles (Engystomops pustulosus) either in isolation, with a conspecific tadpole or with an aggressive heterospecific tadpole, the whistling frog tadpole, Leptodactylus fuscus. In each treatment, we measured the body size, activity, exploration and risk taking in the presence of a predator in focal E. pustulosus tadpoles six times during development. We used univariate and multivariate hierarchical mixed effect models to investigate the effect of treatment on mean behaviour and on among individual variance between and within individuals across behavioural traits. There was a strong effect of competition on behaviour, with different population and individual level responses across social treatments. Within their home tank, individuals were more consistent in their movements under conspecific competition but heterospecific competition caused more variance in the average movement among individuals. Behavioural responses were also trait specific as conspecific competition caused greater variability in movements among individuals in a novel environment. The results highlight that the impact of competition on inter-individual differences in behaviour is dependent on competitor species identity and is trait specific.",

Protein contents in bacteria and lipid droplets in living pancreatic cancer cells are visualized. Altered lipid metabolism in drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells is observed with the MIP-FLF microscope.",

    "abstract": "The current trend for implantable Brain Machine Interfaces (BMIs) is to increase the channel count, towards next generation devices that improve on information transfer rate. This however increases the raw data bandwidth for wired or wireless systems that ultimately impacts the power budget (and thermal dissipation). On-implant feature extraction and/or compression are therefore becoming essential to reduce the data rate, however the processing power is of concern. One common feature extraction technique for intracortical BMIs is spike detection. In this work, we have empirically compared the performance, resource utilization, and power consumption of three hardware efficient spike emphasizers, Non-linear Energy Operator (NEO), Amplitude Slope Operator (ASO) and Energy of Derivative (ED), and two common statistical thresholding mechanisms (using mean or median). We also propose a novel median approximation to address the issue of the median operator not being hardware-efficient to implement. These have all been implemented and evaluated on reconfigurable hardware (FPGA) to estimate their hardware efficiency in an ultimate ASIC design. Our results suggest that ED with average thresholding provides the most hardware efficient (low power/resource) choice, while using median has the advantage of improved detection accuracy and higher robustness on threshold multiplier settings. This work is significant because it is the first to implement and compare the hardware and algorithm trade-offs that have to be made before translating the algorithms into hardware instances to design wireless implantable BMIs.",

    "abstract": "Artificial human blastoids are used to investigate early embryo development, pregnancy failures, and birth deficiencies, previously impossible without human embryos. Recent methods generating blastoids used human naive pluripotent stem cells, which are prone to genomic instability during in vitro culturing. Here, we introduce a simple, robust, and scalable method for generating human blastoids from more stable, primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). Using a non-cell-adhesive hydrogel, hPSC aggregates formed an asymmetric blastoid structure with a cellular distribution similar to that of a human blastocyst, with in vitro implantation capability. Single-cell RNA-seq followed by cellular trajectory analysis revealed that hydrogel promoted differentiation to tri-lineage cells associated with a blastocyst. This model will allow studies on the underlying mechanisms of human pre- and postimplantation processes, consider elaborating on the potential implications of the model on assistive reproductive technology.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryNo more than 125 characters and spaces.",

Conventionally, temporal parameters - such as T2, T1, or diffusion constants - are assessed by first fitting each spectrum independently, and subsequently fitting a temporal model (1D fitting). We investigated whether simultaneously fitting the entire dataset using a single spectral-temporal model (2D fitting) would improve the precision of the relevant temporal parameter.\n\nMethodsWe derived a Cramer Rao Lower Bound for the temporal parameters for both 1D and 2D approaches, for two experiments: A multi-echo (MTE) experiment, designed to estimate metabolite T2s; And a functional (fMRS) experiment, designed to estimate fractional change ({delta}) in metabolite concentrations. We investigated the dependence of the relative standard deviation of T2 in MTE and{delta} in fMRS.\n\nResultsWhen peaks were spectrally distant, 2D fitting improved precision by approximately 20% relative to 1D fitting, regardless of the experiment and other parameter values.

Among the different tasks, drug repurposing, the task of identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this work, we propose a node embedding algorithm for the problem of drug repurposing. The proposed algorithm learns node representations that capture the influence of nodes in the biological network by learning a mass term for each node along with its embedding. We apply the proposed algorithm to a multiscale interactome network and embed its nodes (i. e., proteins, drugs, diseases and biological functions) into a low-dimensional space. We evaluate the generated embeddings in the drug repurposing task. Our experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines and offers an improvement of 53.33% in average precision over typical walk-based embedding approaches.",

    "abstract": "Predictions for millions of protein three-dimensional structures are only a few clicks away since the release of AlphaFold2 results for UniProt. However, many proteins have so-called intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that do not adopt unique structures in isolation. These IDRs are associated with several diseases, including Alzheimers Disease. We showed that three recent disorder measures of AlphaFold2 predictions (pLDDT, \"experimentally resolved\" prediction and \"relative solvent accessibility\") correlated to some extent with IDRs. However, expert methods predict IDRs more reliably by combining complex machine learning models with expert-crafted input features and evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). MSAs are not always available, especially for IDRs, and are computationally expensive to generate, limiting the scalability of the associated tools. Here, we present the novel method SETH that predicts residue disorder from embeddings generated by the protein Language Model ProtT5, which explicitly only uses single sequences as input. Thereby, our method, relying on a relatively shallow convolutional neural network, outperformed much more complex solutions while being much faster, allowing to create predictions for the human proteome in about one hour on a consumer-grade PC with one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. Trained on a continuous disorder scale (CheZOD scores), our method captured subtle variations in disorder, thereby providing important information beyond the binary classification of most methods. High performance paired with speed revealed that SETHs nuanced disorder predictions for entire proteomes capture aspects of the evolution of organisms. Additionally, SETH could also be used to filter out regions or proteins with probable low-quality AlphaFold2 3D structures to prioritize running the compute-intensive predictions for large data sets.

Sequencing data comes with, several challenges such as sharing, storing, integrating, analyzing, and interpretion. The management of the expanding amount of data is challenging and, especially for human omics data, privacy protection is crucial. Unraveling the causes of rare diseases is critically dependent on data sharing, but progress is hampered by regulations and privacy concerns. To overcome the concerns associated with centralized human genomic data storage, we developed a federated analysis platform, referred to as Widely Integrated NGS (WiNGS). The presented approach enables datasharing and combined data-analysis of omics data across a consortium without a centralized data store. Moreover, the platform incorporates extensive variant interpretation tools from genotype to phenotype for the diagnosis of rare developmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Human microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms. Microbiota can modulate the host physiology through molecule and metabolite interactions. Integrating microbiome and metabolomics data have the potential to predict different diseases more accurately. Yet, most datasets only measure microbiome data but without paired metabolome data. Here, we propose a novel integrative modeling framework, Microbiome-based Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework (MB-SupCon). MB-SupCon integrates microbiome and metabolome data to generate microbiome embeddings, which can be used to improve the prediction accuracy in datasets that only measure microbiome data. As a proof of concept, we applied MB-SupCon on 720 samples with paired 16S microbiome data and metabolomics data from patients with type 2 diabetes. MB-SupCon outperformed existing prediction methods and achieves high average prediction accuracies for insulin resistance status (84.62%), sex (78.98%), and race (80.04%). Moreover, the microbiome embeddings form separable clusters for different covariate groups in the lower-dimensional space, which enhances data visualization. We also applied MB-SupCon on a large inflammatory bowel disease study and observed similar advantages. Thus, MB-SupCon could be broadly applicable to improve microbiome prediction models in multi-omics disease studies.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been one of the primary instruments to measure the properties of the human brain non-invasively in vivo. MRI data generally needs to go through a series of processing steps (i.e., a pipeline) before statistical analysis. Currently, the processing pipelines for multi-modal MRI data are still rare, in contrast to single-modal pipelines. Furthermore, the reliability and validity of the output of the pipelines are critical for the MRI studies. However, the reliability and validity measures are not available or adequate for almost all pipelines.\n\nHere, we present PhiPipe, a multi-modal MRI processing pipeline. PhiPipe could process T1-weighted, resting-state BOLD, and diffusion-weighted MRI data and generate commonly used brain features in neuroimaging. We evaluated the test-retest reliability of PhiPipes brain features by computing intra-class correlations (ICC) in four public datasets with repeated scans. We further evaluated the predictive validity by computing the correlation of brain features with chronological age in three public adult lifespan datasets. The multi-variate reliability and predictive validity of the PhiPipe results were also evaluated. The results of PhiPipe were consistent with previous studies, showing comparable or better reliability and validity when compared with two popular single-modality pipelines, namely DPARSF and PANDA.\n\nThe publicly available PhiPipe provides a simple-to-use solution to multi-modal MRI data processing. The accompanied reliability and validity assessments could help researchers make informed choices in experimental design and statistical analysis. Furthermore, this study provides a framework for evaluating the reliability and validity of image processing pipelines.",

    "abstract": "The number of published metagenome assemblies is rapidly growing due to advances in sequencing technologies. However, sequencing errors, variable coverage, repetitive genomic regions, and other factors can produce misassemblies, which are challenging to detect for taxonomically novel genomic data. Assembly errors can affect all downstream analyses of the assemblies. Accuracy for the state of the art in reference-free misassembly prediction does not exceed an AUPRC of 0.57, and it is not clear how well these models generalize to real-world data. Here, we present the Residual neural network for Misassembled Contig identification (ResMiCo), a deep learning approach for reference-free identification of misassembled contigs. To develop ResMiCo, we first generated a training dataset of unprecedented size and complexity that can be used for further benchmarking and developments in the field. Through rigorous validation, we show that ResMiCo is substantially more accurate than the state of the art, and the model is robust to novel taxonomic diversity and varying assembly methods. ResMiCo estimated 4.7% misassembled contigs per metagenome across multiple real-world datasets. We demonstrate how ResMiCo can be used to optimize metagenome assembly hyperparameters to improve accuracy, instead of optimizing solely for contiguity. The accuracy, robustness, and ease-of-use of ResMiCo make the tool suitable for general quality control of metagenome assemblies and assembly methodology optimization.\n\nAuthor summaryMetagenome assembly quality is fundamental to all downstream analyses of such data. The number of metagenome assemblies, especially metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), is rapidly increasing, but tools to assess the quality of these assemblies lack the accuracy needed for robust quality control. Moreover, existing models have been trained on datasets lacking complexity and realism, which may limit their generalization to novel data. Due to the limitations of existing models, most studies forgo such approaches and instead rely on CheckM to assess assembly quality, an approach that only utilizes a small portion of all genomic information and does not identify specific misassemblies. We harnessed existing large genomic datasets and high-performance computing to produce a training dataset of unprecedented size and complexity and thereby trained a deep learning model for predicting misassemblies that can robustly generalize to novel taxonomy and varying assembly methodologies.",

Its inherently pleiotropic nature make miRNAs strong candidates for the development of cancer therapeutics, yet despite its potential, there remains a challenge to deliver nucleic acid-based therapies into cancer cells. We developed a novel approach to modify miRNAs by replacing the uracil bases with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the guide strand of tumor suppressor miRNAs, thereby combining the therapeutic effect of 5-FU with tumor suppressive effect of miRNAs to create a potent, multi-targeted therapeutic molecule without altering its native RNA interference (RNAi) function. To demonstrate the general applicability of this approach to other tumor suppressive miRNAs, we screened a panel of 12 novel miRNA mimetics in several cancer types including leukemia, breast, gastric, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Our results show that 5-FU-modified miRNA mimetics have increased potency (low nM range) in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and that these mimetics can be delivered into cancer cells without delivery vehicle both in vitro and in vivo, thus representing significant advancements in the development of therapeutic miRNAs for cancer. This work demonstrates the potential of fluoropyrimidine modifications that can be broadly applicable and may serve as a platform technology for future miRNA and nucleic acid-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "CIGB-300 is a clinical-grade anti- Protein Kinase CK2 peptide, binding both its substrates phospho-acceptor site and the CK2 catalytic subunit. The cyclic p15 inhibitory domain of CIGB-300 was initially selected in a phage display library screen for its ability to bind the CK2 phospho-acceptor domain of HPV-16 E7. However, the actual role of this targeting in CIGB-300s antitumoral mechanism remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the physical interaction of CIGB-300 with HPV-E7 and its impact on CK2-mediated phosphorylation. Hence, we studied the relevance of targeting E7 phosphorylation for the cytotoxic effect induced by CIGB-300. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by western blot were performed to study the impact of the peptide on the E7-pRB interaction. Interestingly, we found a clear binding of CIGB-300 to the N terminal region of E7 proteins from HPV-16 type. Accordingly, the in vivo physical interaction of the peptide with HPV-16 E7 reduces the CK2-mediated phosphorylation of E7, as well as its binding to the tumour suppressor pRB. However, the targeting of E7 phosphorylation by CIGB-300 seemed to be dispensable for the induction of cell death in HPV-18 cervical cancer-derived C4-1 cells. These findings unveil novel molecular clues to the means by which the CIGB-300 triggers cell death in cervical cancer cells.",

The path to ZEB1 induction involves a paracrine process: cells entering a senescent state following RAS activation release proinflammatory cytokines, notably IL-6 and IL-1 which promote ZEB1 expression and activity in neighbouring cells, thereby fostering their malignant transformation. Collectively, our findings unveil a previously unprecedented role for senescence in bridging RAS activation and EMT over the course of malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe plant Acacia sieberiana (Fabaceae) is traditionally used to manage hepatitis. This research work aims to investigate the hepatoprotective effectiveness of root bark extract of Acacia sieberiana (ASE) against paracetamol (PCM) and bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced hepatotoxicity. The phytochemical and median lethal dose (LD50) investigations were conducted. The rats were pre-treated with the ASE (250, 750, 1,500 mg/kg) once daily via oral route for 7 consecutive days. On the 8th day, liver injury was initiated by PCM administration (2g/kg). Similarly, in the BDL-induced liver injury, the animals were administered ASE (125, 250 and 380 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days. After 24 hours, blood samples and hepatic tissues were obtained for biochemical and histopathological investigations.\n\nResultsPhytocomponents determination revealed glycosides, triterpenes, glycosides, saponins, tannins, flavonoids and alkaloids. The oral and intraperitoneal LD50 values of the ASE were >5,000 and 1,300 mg/kg, respectively. The ASE efficiently (p<0.05) decreased the alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels and elevated the albumin and total protein (TP) levels. The direct bilirubin effectively (p<0.05) decreased at 750 mg/kg. Besides, the extract efficiently elevated the glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in relation to the PCM hepatotoxic group. Also, the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was reduced by the ASE. Meanwhile, in the BDL- induced liver injury, the ASE remarkably (p<0.05) declined the AST, ALP, bilirubin and MDA. Besides, there was effective (p<0.05) elevation in SOD, GPx and CAT in the ASE-treated groups. The morphology of liver tissue was preserved at 125 and 250 mg/kg ASE groups from BDL-induced necrosis and vascular congestion.\n\nConclusionThe study shows that the ASE has hepatoprotective actions against liver damage by possible modulation of biochemical and oxidative stress biomarkers",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe primary objective was to evaluate the reliability of a new tool for assessing shoulder muscle performance: The ExtRA Capacity Test. The secondary objective was to assess whether this tool was a valid measure for assessing shoulder strength.\n\nMethodsThe ExtRA Capacity test involves two measures: maximal scapular plane lateral raises to 90{degrees} abduction with 2.5kg of external load and the maximal number of prone lying unsupported external rotations with the shoulder at 90{degrees} abduction. Both capacity tests are completed to a metronome set to 30 beats per minute 20 asymptomatic participants were sampled on 2 separate sessions, 1 week apart. The ExtRA Capacity Test was completed by the lead researcher and an independent physiotherapist. Shoulder strength was also measured using isokinetic dynamometry.\n\nResultsThe test showed excellent inter-rater reliability (mean abduction ICC= 0.969, mean external rotation ICC= 0.822, with a 95% CI). Mean intra-rater variability was 3.96{+/-} 4.09 for the abduction measure and 1.70{+/-} 1.17 for the external rotation measure. Validity was calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient. The abduction measure showed good/ moderate correlation for the majority of strength measurements taken using isokinetic dynamometry however the external rotation capacity test did not correlate closely to isokinetic dynamometry strength measures.\n\nConclusionThe abduction component of the ExtRA Capacity Test is a suitable measure for assessing shoulder strength in clinical practice. The external rotation measure is of suitable reliability however if used in clinical practice, it should not be used to assess shoulder strength, instead it may be suitable to assess movement control of the shoulder.\n\nSummaryVarious methods of measuring shoulder strength exist, ranging from cost free, relatively inaccurate methods to costly, complex methods which are of high reliability and validity but are challenging to use in a fast-pace, clinical environment. Objective outcome measures are used within a rehabilitation setting however at present there is no upper limb muscle performance test that is suitable to use on all people, regardless of strength or fitness level. Capacity testing of movements provides a functional, insight into strength specific to a real world/ sporting environment with lower limb capacity tests providing clear objective baselines that can be used for goal setting and providing return to play criteria following injury. This study proves the reliability and validity of the ExtRA Capacity Test which is a measure of shoulder muscle performance, suitable for people of all physical activity levels and upper limb strength.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the field of systems vaccinology has emerged, in which high throughput transcriptomics and other omics assays are used to probe changes of the innate and adaptive immune system in response to vaccination. RNA-Seq technology has matured in recent years and is now widely deployed for transcriptional analysis of clinical specimens. The goal of this study was to benchmark technical parameters of RNA-Seq in the context of a multi-site, double-blind randomized clinical trial using primary patient samples. We collected longitudinal peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 10 subjects after vaccination with a live attenuated Francisella tularensis vaccine and performed RNA-Seq at two different sites using aliquots from the same sample to generate two large-scale replicate datasets. We evaluated the impact of: (i) filtering lowly-expressed genes, (ii) using external RNA controls, (iii) fold change and false discovery rate (FDR) filtering, (iv) read length, and (v) sequencing depth on differential expressed genes (DEGs) concordance between replicate datasets. Using synthetic mRNA spike-ins, we developed a method for empirically establishing minimal read-count thresholds for maintaining fold change accuracy on a per-experiment basis. We defined a reference PBMC transcriptome by pooling sequence data, and established the impact of read depth and gene filtering on transcript representation. Lastly, we modeled statistical power to detect DE genes for a range of sample sizes, effect sizes, and coverage depths. The results from this study provide RNA sequencing benchmarks and guidelines for planning future similar vaccine studies.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are a class of birth defects affecting [~]1% of live births. These conditions are hallmarked by extreme genetic heterogeneity, and therefore, despite a strong genetic component, only a very handful of at-risk loci in CHD have been identified. We herein introduced systems analyses to uncover the hidden organization on biological networks of genomic mutations in CHD, and leveraged network analysis techniques to integrate the human interactome, large-scale patient exomes, the fetal heart spatial transcriptomes, and single-cell transcriptomes of clinical samples. We identified a highly connected network in CHD where most of the member proteins had previously uncharacterized functions in regulating fetal heart development. While genes on the network displayed strong enrichment for heart-specific functions, a sub-group, active specifically at early developmental stages, also regulates fetal brain development, thereby providing mechanistic insights into the clinical comorbidities between CHD and neurodevelopmental conditions. At a small scale, we experimentally verified previously uncharacterized cardiac functions of several novel proteins employing cellular assays and gene editing techniques. At a global scale, our study revealed developmental dynamics of the identified CHD network and observed the strongest enrichment for pathogenic mutations in the network specific to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Our single-cell transcriptome analysis further identified pervasive dysregulation of the network in cardiac endothelial cells and the conduction system in the HLHS left ventricle. Taken together, our systems analyses identified novel factors in CHD, revealed key molecular mechanisms in HLHS, and provides a generalizable framework readily applicable to studying many other complex diseases.",

This complements the finding from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies linking reward, emotion regulation, empathy and mentalisation networks to the  parental brain. Here, we used MEG in 43 first-time mothers listening to infant and adult cry vocalisations to investigate the link with mother-infant postpartum bonding scores and their level of sleep deprivation (assessed using both actigraphy and sleep logs). We found significant differences 800-1000ms after onset of infant compared to adult cries in source-reconstructed brain activity in areas previously linked to the parental brain. Importantly, mothers with weaker bonding scores showed decreased brain responses to infant cries in the auditory cortex, middle and superior temporal gyrus, OFC, hippocampal areas, supramarginal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus at around 100-200ms after stimulus onset. In contrast, we did not find correlations with sleep deprivation scores. The significant changes in brain processing of an infants distress signals could be a novel marker of weaker infant bonding in new mothers and should be investigated in vulnerable populations.",

Many efforts have been made for developing vascular thrombosis methods to study vascular dysfunction in vivo, while technical challenges remain, such as accuracy and depth-selectivity to target single vessel in the cerebral cortex. Herein, we first demonstrates the evaluation and quantification of the feasibility and effects of Rose Bengal (RB)-induced photothrombosis with 720-1070 nm ultrafast lasers in raster scan. A flexible and reproducible approach is then proposed to employ a 1070 nm ultrafast laser with spiral scan for producing RB-induced occlusion, which is described as precision ultrafast laser-induced photothrombosis (PLP). Combine with two-photon microscopy imaging, this PLP displays highly precise and fast occlusion induction of various vessel types, sizes, and depths, which enhances the precision and power of the photothrombosis protocol. Overall, the PLP method provides a real-time, practical, precise, and depth-selected single-vessel photothrombosis technology in cerebral cortex with commercially available optical equipment, which is crucial for exploring brain vascular function with high spatial temporal resolution in brain.",

    "abstract": "Numerous tau immunotherapies are being developed against Alzheimers disease (AD), but it has been challenging to specifically target early-stage tau aggregates using conformation-dependent antibodies. Here, we report a monoclonal antibody, APNmAb005, that recognized a conformational epitope associated with tau oligomers. In AD brain extracts, mAb005 preferentially recognized oligomeric tau in the synapse over monomeric tau in the cytosol. In the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, mAb005 immunoreactivity was strongly present in early-stage AD but surprisingly diminished in late-stage AD (Braak stage VI). mAb005 also recognized aggregates in 3R tauopathies (Picks disease) and 4R tauopathies (corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy), including those in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In rTg4510 mice (P301L tau), mAb005 immunoreactivity first appeared in distal neurites but much later in neuronal somas. Thus, the mAb005 epitope appears to be associated with early-stage oligomers of tau (esoTau) that accumulate around synapses in AD, which is also detectable in both 3R and 4R tauopathies. In cellular uptake models of tauopathy transmission, mAb005 blocked the formation of intracellular inclusions induced by incubation with rTg4510 mouse brain extracts. Long-term treatments with mAb005 in rTg4510 mice partially rescued synaptic and neuronal loss in the hippocampus without promoting overall tau clearance. Our data suggest that immunotherapies targeting esoTau enriched around synaptic sites may alleviate tau toxicity against synapses and neurons, which may be a promising treatment strategy against AD.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA tau-conformer antibody recognizing synaptic oligomers and 3R, 4R, and mixed aggregates in humans rescues neuronal loss in mouse tauopathy models.",

How these two OFC functions interact is largely unknown. We recorded intracranial activity from the OFC of ten patients making choices in the context of different types of inequity (disadvantageous vs. advantageous). We found that high-frequency activity (70-150 HZ) encoded the amount of self-reward, consistent with previous reports. We also observed novel evidence for encoding in human OFC of the social counterparts reward as well as the type of inequity being experienced. Additionally, we find social context modulates reward encoding: depending on inequity type, reward encoding was switched on and off rapidly within electrodes, across trials. These results provide direct evidence for explicit encoding of self- and other- rewards in the human OFC, and for rapid and reversible changes in encoding schemes driven by socially relevant contexts.",

    "abstract": "Most dynamic functional connectivity in fMRI data is focused on linear correlations, and to our knowledge, no study has studied whole brain explicitly nonlinear dynamic relationships within the data. While some approaches have attempted to study overall connectivity more generally using flexible models, we are particularly interested in whether the non-linear relationships, above and beyond linear, are capturing unique information. This study thus proposes an approach to assess the explicitly nonlinear dynamic functional network connectivity derived from the relationship among independent component analysis time courses. Linear relationships were removed at each time point to evaluate, typically ignored, explicitly nonlinear dFNC using normalized mutual information. Simulations showed the proposed method accurately estimated NMI over time, even within relatively short windows of data. Results on fMRI data included 151 schizophrenia patients, and 163 healthy controls showed three unique, highly structured, mostly long-range, functional states that also showed significant group differences. This analysis identifies a higher level of explicitly nonlinear dependencies in transient connectivity within the visual network in healthy controls compared to schizophrenia patients. In particular, nonlinear relationships tend to be more widespread than linear ones. We also find highly significant differences in the relative co-occurrence of linear and explicitly nonlinear states in HC and SZ, suggesting these may be an important aspect of the disorder. Overall, this work suggests that quantifying nonlinear dependencies of dynamic functional connectivity may provide a complementary and potentially valuable tool for studying brain function by exposing relevant variation that is typically ignored.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAromatase Inhibitors (AIs) block physiological estrogen production in peripheral tissues and are used clinically to reduce disease recurrences and improve overall survival rates in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. However, half of patients taking these drugs develop aromatase inhibitor induced arthralgia (AIIA), which is characterized by severe pain and inflammation in various joints and the surrounding musculoskeletal tissue. While the pathophysiology is not currently understood, it has been proposed to be associated with systemic estrogen deficiency resulting from AI treatment. Since AIIA leads to suspension of therapy in 20-30% of patients, reducing AIIA incidence may provide sustained AI treatment and enhance long-term survival.\n\nObjectiveIn order to establish a better understanding of disease pathology and to create a platform that can be used to explore future interventional strategies, our objective in this study was to design a novel animal model of AIIA.\n\nMethodsFemale BALB/C-Tg(NF{kappa}B-RE-luc)-Xen mice, which have a firefly luciferase cDNA reporter transgene under the regulation of NF{kappa}B binding sites, were oophorectomized and treated with AI (letrozole) by daily subcutaneous injections for 5 weeks. Control groups included oophorectomized mice receiving vehicle injections and non-oophorectomized mice treated with AI. Knee joints and surrounding muscle tissue were imaged on the BioSpec 94/30 micro-MRI. The primary weight-bearing joint (hind limb) was examined histopathologically and NF{kappa}B activity was measured by bioluminescent imaging. Serum was collected for cytokine analysis. Additionally, healthy human PBMCs were treated with letrozole, estrogen, or both, and RNA sequencing was performed at 36 hrs.\n\nResultsBioluminescent imaging showed significantly enhanced NF{kappa}B activation with AI treatment in the hind limbs compared to controls receiving vehicle treatment. Moreover, analysis of knee joints and legs by MRI showed enhanced signal detection in the joint space and surrounding tissue following daily AI injections. Surprisingly, the enhanced MRI detection and NF{kappa}B activation was observed with AI treatment independent of the oophorectomy procedure. This indicates that the induction of musculoskeletal-directed inflammation by AI is not mediated by changes in physiological estrogen levels, which is contrary to proposed mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Similarly, histopathological analysis showed tenosynovitis and musculoskeletal infiltrates in all mice receiving AI with or without oophorectomy. IHC analysis of the infiltrates demonstrated a predominantly macrophage-mediated inflammatory response with scattered CD4+ T cells. Additionally, serum cytokine levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and CXCL1 were significantly elevated in mice with AI treatment. RNA sequencing of human PBMCs after in vitro AI stimulation did not demonstrate an AI-specific gene expression pattern associated with immune system activation directly, suggesting that the pathogenesis of AIIA may be mediated through cells in other tissues in vivo.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, these data establish a novel mouse model of AIIA and identify an estrogen-independent stimulation of disease pathology via AI-mediated induction. This suggests that the pathogenesis of AIIA may not be mediated by estrogen deficiency, as previously hypothesized, and indicates that AI-induced inflammation may not be regulated directly through a pathogenic mechanism initially derived from circulating mononuclear cells. Future studies aim to characterize this inflammatory mechanism in vivo with a focus on other cells, including macrophages, synovial cells and chondrocytes, to provide insight into putative therapeutic strategies directed at mitigating disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "Early life establishment of tolerance to commensal bacteria at barrier surfaces carries enduring implications for immune health but remains poorly understood. Here we show that this process is controlled by microbial interaction with a specialized subset of antigen presenting cells. More particularly, we identify CD301b+ type 2 conventional dendritic cells (DC) as a subset in neonatal skin specifically capable of uptake, presentation and generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to commensal antigens. In early life, CD301b+ DC2 are enriched for programs of phagocytosis and maturation, while also expressing tolerogenic markers. In both human and murine skin, these signatures were reinforced by microbial uptake. In contrast to their adult counterparts or other early life DC subsets, neonatal CD301b+ DC2 highly expressed the retinoic acid-producing enzyme, RALDH2, deletion of which limited commensal-specific Tregs. Thus, synergistic interactions between bacteria and a specialized DC subset critically support early life tolerance at the cutaneous interface.",

    "abstract": "Unleashing anti-tumor T cell activity by checkpoint inhibition is effective in many cancer patients but clinical response rates remain limited. Myeloid derived suppressor cells erode antitumor lymphocyte numbers and function, and correlate with resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. By screening small molecule libraries, we identified JAK inhibitors ability to rescue T cell function. Despite its documented immune suppressive properties, the prototypical JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer. This effect correlated with loss of suppressive gene expression, and acquisition of immunostimulatory molecular markers and T cell stimulatory activity in myeloid cells. In preclinical models, ruxolitinib significantly improved the function and increased the total numbers of activated tumor-infiltrating NK and CD4 T cells compared to checkpoint blockade alone and the efficacy was conditional on granulocytic cells. In addition to myeloid reprogramming in the tumor, ruxolitinib blunts G-CSF signaling in the bone marrow to prevent expression of suppressive and chemotaxis genes in neutrophils. In a clinical trial of Hodgkin lymphoma patients resistant to checkpoint inhibitors, treatment with ruxolitinib significantly reduced neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and levels of suppressive markers in myeloid cells but increased numbers of cytokine-producing T cells. These results support the therapeutic potential of JAK inhibition in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in cancer and highlight the potential of reshaped myeloid immunity to improve immunotherapy.\n\nOne sentence summary: Ruxolitinib reshapes myeloid immunity to synergize with checkpoint inhibitors",

    "abstract": "Collecting fine-scale occurrence data for marine species across large spatial scales is logistically challenging, but is important to determine species distributions and for conservation planning. Inaccurate descriptions of species ranges could result in designating protected areas with inappropriate locations or boundaries. Optimising sampling strategies therefore is a priority for scaling up survey approaches using tools such as environmental DNA (eDNA) to capture species distributions. eDNA can detect diverse taxa simultaneously, but to date has rarely been applied across large spatial scales relevant for conservation planning. In a marine context, commercial vessels, such as ferries, could provide sampling platforms allowing access to under-sampled areas and repeatable sampling over time to track community changes. However, sample collection from commercial vessels could be biased and may not represent biological and environmental variability. Here, we evaluate whether sampling along Mediterranean ferry routes can yield unbiased biodiversity survey outcomes, based on perfect knowledge from a stacked species distribution model (SSDM) of marine megafauna. Simulations were carried out representing different sampling strategies (random vs systematic), frames (ferry routes vs unconstrained) and number of sampling points. SSDMs were remade from different sampling simulations and compared to the  perfect knowledge SSDM to quantify the bias associated with different sampling strategies. Ferry routes detected more species and were able to recover known patterns in species richness at smaller sample sizes better than unconstrained sampling points. However, to minimise potential bias, ferry routes should be chosen to cover the variability in species composition and its environmental predictors in the SSDMs. The workflow presented here can be used to design effective eDNA sampling strategies using commercial vessel routes globally. This approach has potential to provide a cost-effective method to access remote oceanic areas on a regular basis, and can recover meaningful data on spatiotemporal biodiversity patterns.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases threaten endangered species, particularly in small isolated populations. Seabird populations on the remote Amsterdam Island in the Indian Ocean have been in decline for the past three decades, with avian cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida proposed as the primary driver. However, Erysipelothrix spp. has also been sporadically detected from albatrosses on Amsterdam Island and may be contributing to some of the observed mortality. In this study, we genomically characterised 16 Erysipelothrix spp. isolates obtained from three Indian yellow-nosed albatross chick carcasses in 2019. Two isolates were sequenced using both Illumina short-read and MinION long-read approaches, which - following hybrid assembly - resulted in closed circular genomes. Mapping of Illumina reads from the remaining isolates to one of these new reference genomes revealed that all 16 isolates were closely related, with a maximum of 13 nucleotide differences distinguishing any pair of isolates. The nucleotide diversity of isolates obtained from the same or different carcasses was similar, suggesting all three chicks were likely infected from a common source. These genomes were compared with a global collection of genomes from E. rhusiopathiae and other species from the same genus. The isolates from albatrosses were phylogenetically distinct, sharing a most recent common ancestor with E. rhusiopathiae. Based on phylogenomic analysis and standard thresholds for average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridisation, these isolates represent a novel Erysipelothrix species, for which we propose the name Erysipelothrix amsterdamensis sp. nov. The type strain is E. amsterdamensis A18Y020dT. The implications of this bacterium for albatross conservation will require further study.",

    "abstract": "The collective transport of massive food items by ant teams is a striking example of biological cooperation, but it remains unclear how these decentralized teams coordinate to overcome the various challenges associated with transport. Previous research has focused on transport across horizontal surfaces and very shallow inclines, disregarding the complexity of natural foraging environments. In the ant Oecophylla smaragdina, prey are routinely carried up tree trunks to arboreal nests. Using this species, we induce collective transport over a variety of angled surfaces with varying prey masses to investigate how ants respond to inclines. We found that weight and incline pose qualitatively different challenges during transport. Prey were carried over vertical inclines faster than across horizontal surfaces even though inclines were associated with longer routes and a higher probability of dropping the load. This additional speed is associated with more transporters being allocated to vertical loads and not from the persistence of individual ants. Ant teams also regulated a stable \"prey delivery rate\" (rate of return per transporter) across all treatments. Our proposed constrained optimization model explains these results: prey intake rate at the colony level is maximized when the allocation of transporters yields a similar prey delivery rate across loads.",

In this article, we show that overexpression of the secreted WNT agonist R-spondin-1 leads to ectopic activation of WNT/{beta}-catenin signalling and causes sex-specific adrenocortical hyperplasia in mice. While female adrenals show ectopic proliferation, male adrenals display excessive immune system activation and cortical thinning. Using a combination of genetic manipulations and hormonal treatment, we show that gonadal androgens suppress ectopic proliferation in the adrenal cortex and determine the selective activation of WNT-related genes Axin2 and Wnt4. Notably, genetic removal of androgen receptor (AR) from adrenocortical cells restores the mitogenic effect of WNT/{beta}-catenin signalling. This is the first demonstration that AR activity in the adrenal cortex determines susceptibility to canonical WNT signalling-induced hyperplasia.\n\nTeaserActivation of R-spondin signaling in the adrenal cortex leads to a sexually dimorphic phenotype causing tumors in females and immune cell recruitment in males",

    "abstract": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV) typically cause chronic infections by modulating homeostasis of infected basal cell to ensure persistence. Using FUCCI and cell-cell competition assays, we established the role of two common viral targets of low-risk and high-risk E6 proteins, E6AP and NHERF1, on four key components of epithelial homeostasis. These includes cell density, proliferation, commitment to differentiation and basal layer delamination. Our RNA sequencing results validated E6s effects on homeostasis and revealed similar transcriptional gene regulation of E6-expressing cells and E6AP-/- cells. For example, yes-associated protein (YAP) target genes were up-regulated by either E6 expression or E6AP depletion. This is also supported by YAP expression pattern in both monolayer cell culture and HPV-infected clinical tissues. As the conserved binding partner of Alpha group HPV E6 proteins, the precise role of E6AP in modulating keratinocyte phenotype and associated signalling pathways have not been defined. We demonstrate that deletion of E6AP in keratinocytes delayed the onset of differentiation and the abundance of E6AP is reduced in HPV-infected tissue. This suggests that Alpha E6 regulates epithelium homeostasis by inhibiting E6APs activity, leading to alteration of multiple downstream pathways including YAP activation. Potential treatments can thus be developed to resolve the reservoir of HPV infection.",

Here, we report that Arabidopsis AAR2, a homolog of a U5 snRNP assembly factor in yeast and humans, not only acts in splicing but also promotes miRNA biogenesis. AAR2 interacts with the microprocessor component HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) in the cytoplasm, nucleus and dicing bodies. In aar2 mutants, abundance of nonphosphorylated HYL1, the active form of HYL1, and the number of HYL1-labeled dicing bodies are reduced. Primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) accumulation is compromised despite normal promoter activities of MIR genes in aar2 mutants. RNA decay assays show that the aar2-1 mutation leads to faster degradation of pri-miRNAs in a HYL1-dependent manner, which reveals a previously unknown and negative role of HYL1 in miRNA biogenesis. Taken together, our findings reveal a dual role of AAR2 in miRNA biogenesis and pre-mRNA splicing.\n\nSignificanceIn yeast and humans, AAR2 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing through regulating U5 snRNP assembly. This study shows that Arabidopsis AAR2 promotes microRNA (miRNA) accumulation in addition to its conserved role in pre-mRNA splicing.

The study also reveals a previously unknown role of HYL1 in causing the degradation of the primary precursors to miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) and a role of AAR2 in protecting pri-miRNAs from HYL1-depedent degradation.

However, little is known about how chromatin access and epigenetic gene silencing influence mature glial cells and retinal regeneration.

In chick, AHCY, AHCYL1, AHCYL2 and many different HMTs are dynamically expressed by MG and MGPCs in damaged retinas. Inhibition of SAHH reduced levels of H3K27me3 and potently blocks the formation of proliferating MGPCs. By using a combination of single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq, we find significant changes in gene expression and chromatin access in MG with SAHH inhibition and NMDA-treatment; many of these genes are associated with glial and neuronal differentiation. A strong correlation across gene expression, chromatin access, and transcription factor motif access in MG was observed for transcription factors known to covey glial identity and promote retinal development. By comparison, in the mouse retina, inhibition of SAHH has no influence on the formation of neuron-like cells from Ascl1-overexpressing MG. We conclude that in the chick, but not the mouse, the activity of SAHH and HMTs are required for the reprogramming of MG into MGPCs by regulating chromatin access to transcription factors associated with glial differentiation and retinal development.",

    "abstract": "Larval zebrafish that are exposed repeatedly to dark looming stimuli will quickly habituate to these aversive signals and cease to respond with their stereotypical escape swims.\n\nA dark looming stimulus can be separated into two independent components: one that is characterized by an overall spatial expansion, where overall luminance is maintained at the same level, and a second, that represents an overall dimming within the whole visual field in the absence of any motion energy. Using specific stimulation patterns that isolate these independent components, we first extracted the behavioral algorithms that dictate how these separate information channels interact with each other and across the two eyes during the habituation process. Concurrent brain wide imaging experiments then permitted the construction of circuit models that suggest the existence of three separate neural pathways. The first is a looming channel which responds specifically to concentrically expanding edges and relays that information to the brain stem escape network to generate directed escapes.\n\nThe second is a dimming specific channel that serves to support and amplify the looming pathway. While the looming channel operates in a purely monocular fashion where stimuli are relayed exclusively to the contralateral hemisphere, dimming responses are processed in both monocular and binocular pathways. Finally, we identify a third, separate and largely monocular, dimming channel that appears to specifically inhibit escape responses when activated. We propose that, unlike the first two channels, this third channel is under strong contextual modulation and that it is primarily responsible for the incremental silencing of successive dark looming evoked escapes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are going to apply graph representation learning algorithms to identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients within a large brain imaging dataset. Since ASD is characterized by social deficits and repetitive behavioral symptoms, it is mainly identified by brain functional connectivity patterns. Attempts to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from ASD are the essence of ASD classification. We claim that considering the connectivity patterns of the brain can be appropriately executed by graph representation learning methods. These methods can capture the whole structure of the brain, both local and global properties. The investigation is done for the brain imaging worldwide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange). The classifier adapted to the features embedded in graphs is a LeNet deep neural network. Among different graph representation techniques, we used AWE, Node2vec, Struct2vec, multi node2vec, and Graph2Img. The best approach was Graph2Img, in which after extracting the feature vectors representative of the brain nodes, the PCA algorithm is applied to the matrix of feature vectors. Although we could not outperform the previous 70% accuracy of 10-fold cross-validation in the identification of ASD versus control patients in the dataset, for leave-one-site-out cross-validation, we could obtain better results (our accuracy: 80%). It is evident that the effect of graph embedding methods is making the connectivity matrix more suitable for applying to a deep network.",

    "abstract": "Brain-Wide Association Studies (BWAS) have become a dominant method for linking mind and brain over the past 30 years. Univariate models test tens to hundreds of thousands of brain voxels individually, whereas multivariate models ( multivariate BWAS) integrate signals across brain regions into a predictive model. Numerous problems have been raised with univariate BWAS, including lack of power and reliability and an inability to account for pattern-level information embedded in distributed neural circuits1-3. Multivariate predictive models address many of these concerns, and offer substantial promise for delivering brain-based measures of behavioral and clinical states and traits2,3.\n\nIn their recent paper4, Marek et al. evaluated the effects of sample size on univariate and multivariate BWAS in three large-scale neuroimaging dataset and came to the general conclusion that \"BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals\". We applaud their comprehensive analysis, and we agree that (a) large samples are needed when conducting univariate BWAS of individual differences in trait measures, and (b) multivariate BWAS reveal substantially larger effects and are therefore more highly powered. However, we disagree with Marek et al.s claims that multivariate BWAS provide \"inflated in-sample associations\" that often fail to replicate (i.e., are underpowered), and that multivariate BWAS consequently require thousands of participants when predicting trait-level individual differences. Here we substantiate that (i) with appropriate methodology, the reported in-sample effect size inflation in multivariate BWAS can be entirely eliminated, and (ii) in most cases, multivariate BWAS effects are replicable with substantially smaller sample sizes (Figure 1).\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/497072v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180764borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d64a2forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a0865aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d4b14c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Multivariate BWAS provide unbiased effect sizes and high replicability with low-moderate sample sizes. (a) In-sample effects in multivariate BWAS are only inflated if estimates are obtained without cross-validation. (b) Cross-validation fully eliminates in-sample effect size inflation and, as a consequence, provides higher replicability. Each point in (a) and (b) corresponds to one bootstrap subsample, as in Fig. 4b of Marek et al. Dotted lines denote the threshold for p=0.05 with n=495. (c) The inflation of in-sample effect size obtained without cross-validation (red) is reduced, but does not disappear, at higher sample sizes. Conversely, cross-validated estimates (blue) are slightly pessimistic with low sample sizes and become quickly unbiased as sample size is increased. (d) Without cross-validation, in-sample effect size estimates are non-zero (r{approx}0.5, red) even when predicting permuted outcome data. Cross-validation eliminates systematic bias across all sample sizes (blue). Dashed lines in (c) and (d) denote 95% parametric confidence intervals, and shaded areas denote bootstrap and permutation-based confidence intervals. (e-f) Cross-validated analysis reveals that sufficient in-sample power (e) and out-of-sample replication probability (P(rep)) (f) can be achieved for a variety of phenotypes at low or moderate sample sizes. 80% power and P(rep) are achievable in <500 participants for half the phenotypes tested (colored bars) using the prediction algorithm in Marek et al. (top panels in (e) and (f), sample size required for 80% power or P(rep) shown). Other phenotypes require sample sizes >500 (bars with arrows). Power and P(rep) can be substantially improved with a ridge regression-based model recommended in some comparison studies10,11 (bottom panels in (e) and (f)), with 80% power and P(rep) with sample sizes as low as n=100 and n=75, respectively, when predicting cognitive ability, and sample sizes between 75 and 375 for other investigated variables, except inhibition assessed with the flanker task. (g) We estimated interactions between sample size and publication bias by computing effect size inflation (rdiscovery - rreplication) only for those bootstrap cases where prediction performance was significant (p>0.05) in the replication sample. Our analysis shows that the effect size inflation due to publication bias is modest (<10%) with <500 participants for half the phenotypes using the Marek et al. model and all phenotypes but the flanker using the ridge model.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic variants associated with nicotine-motivated behavioral traits is an important strategy to understand the fundamental mechanisms underpinning smoking and tobacco abuse. For suitable emulation of behavioral phenotype with the full advantage of this invertebrate model, we newly established a worm model of nicotine seeking by Conditioned Cue Preference (CCP). We demonstrated that C. elegans also exhibited pivotal features of nicotine-motivated behaviors as in mammals. First, we identified the nicotine-elicited cue preference is mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in worms. Additionally, we exhibited dopamine is also required for the development of CCP. Subsequently, we identified the nAChRs subunits associated with the facilitation of nicotine preference. Accordingly, we validated human GWAS candidates associated with nicotine dependence involved in the role of those nAChR subunits. we addressed the cross-species functional validation to determine the GWAS candidate genes have authentic roles in nicotine seeking associated with tobacco abuse. The loss of function strain of CACNA2D3 orthologue, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 3, was tested for CCP. We also tested the knock-out (KO) strain of the CACNA2D2 orthologue, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 2, which is closely related to CACNA2D3 in the same family and shared the human smoking phenotypes. Our orthogonal test suggests the functional conservation of the 2{delta} subunit of calcium channel in nicotine motivated behavior.",

    "abstract": "The observation of others actions activates a network of temporal, parietal and premotor/prefrontal areas in macaque monkeys and humans. This action-observation network (AON) has been shown to play important roles in understanding the actions of others, learning by imitation, and social cognition in both species. It is unclear whether a similar network exists in New World primates, which separated from Old Word Primates [~] 35 million years ago. Here we used ultra-high field fMRI at 9.4T in awake common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) while they watched videos depicting the upper-limb of conspecifics performing goal-directed (grasping food) or non-goal-directed actions. We found that the observation of goal-directed actions, compared to non-goal directed ones, activated a temporo-parieto-frontal network, including areas 6 and 45 in premotor and prefrontal cortices, areas PGa-IPa, FST and the TE complex in occipito-temporal region and areas V6A, MIP, LIP and PG in the occipito-parietal cortex. These results show remarkable overlap with the AON observed in humans and macaques. These results demonstrate the existence of an evolutionarily conserved AON that likely predates the separation of Old and New World primates.",

    "abstract": "Protection against Plasmodium falciparum, which is primarily antibody-mediated, requires recurrent exposure to develop. The study of both naturally acquired limited immunity and vaccine induced protection against malaria remains critical for ongoing eradication efforts. Towards this goal, we deployed a customized P. falciparum PhIP-seq T7 phage display library containing 238,068 tiled 62-amino acid peptides, covering all known coding regions, including antigenic variants, to systematically profile antibody targets in 198 Ugandan children and adults from high and moderate transmission settings. Repeat elements - short amino acid sequences repeated within a protein - were significantly enriched in antibody targets. While breadth of responses to repeat-containing peptides was twofold higher in children living in the high versus moderate exposure setting, no such differences were observed for peptides without repeats, suggesting that antibody responses to repeat-containing regions may be more exposure dependent and/or less durable in children than responses to regions without repeats. Additionally, short motifs associated with seroreactivity were extensively shared among hundreds of antigens, potentially representing cross- reactive epitopes. PfEMP1 shared motifs with the greatest number of other antigens, partly driven by the diversity of PfEMP1 sequences. These data suggest that the large number of repeat elements and potential cross-reactive epitopes found within antigenic regions of P. falciparum could contribute to the inefficient nature of malaria immunity.",

    "abstract": "Production of large quantities of hepatocytes remains a major challenge for a number of clinical applications in the biomedical field. Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) provides an advantageous solution and a number of protocols have been developed for this purpose. However, these methods usually follow different steps of liver development in vitro which is time consuming and requires complex culture conditions. In addition, HLCs lack the full repertoire of functionalities characterising primary hepatocytes. Here, we explore the interest of forward programming to generate hepatocytes from hPSCs and to bypass these limitations. This approach relies on the overexpression of 3 hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF1A, HNF6 and FOXA3) in combination with different nuclear receptors expressed in the adult liver using the OPTi-OX platform. Forward programming allows for the rapid production of hepatocytes (FoP-Heps) with functional characteristics using a simplified process. We also uncovered that the overexpression of nuclear receptors such as RORc can enhance specific functionalities of FoP-Heps thereby validating its role in lipid/glucose metabolism. Together, our results show that forward programming could offer a versatile alternative to direct differentiation for generating hepatocytes in vitro.",

We have improved and automated this strategy in Verkko, an iterative, graph-based pipeline for assembling complete, diploid genomes. Verkko begins with a multiplex de Bruijn graph built from long, accurate reads and progressively simplifies this graph via the integration of ultra-long reads and haplotype-specific markers. The result is a phased, diploid assembly of both haplotypes, with many chromosomes automatically assembled from telomere to telomere. Running Verkko on the HG002 human genome resulted in 20 of 46 diploid chromosomes assembled without gaps at 99.9997% accuracy. The complete assembly of diploid genomes is a critical step towards the construction of comprehensive pangenome databases and chromosome-scale comparative genomics.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cell communication events (CEs) are mediated by multiple ligand-receptor pairs. Usually only a particular subset of CEs directly works for a specific downstream response in a particular microenvironment. We name them as functional communication events (FCEs) of the target responses. Decoding the FCE-target gene relations is important for understanding the machanisms of many biological processes, but has been intractable due to the mixing of multiple factors and the lack of direct observations. We developed a method HoloNet for decoding FCEs using spatial transcriptomic data by integrating ligand-receptor pairs, cell-type spatial distribution and downstream gene expression into a deep learning model. We modeled CEs as a multiview network, developed an attention-based graph learning method to train the model for generating target gene expression with the CE networks, and decoded the FCEs for specific downstream genes by interpreting the trained model. We applied HoloNet on three Visium datasets of breast cancer or liver cancer. It revealed the communication landscapes in tumor microenvironments, and uncovered how various ligand-receptor signals and cell types affect specific biological processes. We also validated the stability of HoloNet in a Slideseq-v2 dataset. The experiments showed that HoloNet is a powerful tool on spatial transcriptomic data to help revealing specific cell-cell communications in a microenvironment that shape cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Every heartbeat is initiated by a spontaneous electrical signal generated inside the cardiac pacemaker. The generation of this electrical signal depends on the coordinated opening and closing of different ion channels, where voltage-gated L-type calcium channels play a central role. Despite the reliability of the pacemaker, all mammals experience a linear slowdown of the pacemaker rate with age. In humans, this slowing can become pathological and constitutes the main cause for the requirement of the implantation of artificial pacemakers. However, the mechanisms behind the age-associated slowdown of the pacemaker are not well understood. Here, we show that age directly alters the function of L-type calcium channels in pacemaker cells from mice. These age-associated alterations include: i) a reduction in the density of the channels at the plasma membrane, ii) a reduction in the clustering of the channels, iii) a decrease in channel open probability, and iv) a reduction in the cooperative gating of the calcium channels. Altogether, these age-associated alterations result in a global reduction of the L-type calcium current density and in a slowdown of the pacemaker diastolic depolarization. Remarkably, increasing the open probability of L-type calcium channels pharmacologically was enough to restore pacemaker rate in old cells to the same levels observed in the young. Overall, our findings provide evidence that proper organization and function of L-type calcium channels is impaired by aging and that this dysfunction contributes to the slowdown of pacemaker cells in old animals.",

    "abstract": "Stem-cell transplantation and genetic therapies offer potential cures for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) but these options require advanced medical facilities and are expensive. Consequently, these treatments will not be available to the vast majority of patients suffering from this disease for many years. What is urgently needed now is an inexpensive oral drug in addition to hydroxyurea, the only successful drug approved by the FDA that inhibits sickle-hemoglobin polymerization. Here we report results of the first phase of our phenotypic screen of the 12,657 compounds of the Scripps ReFrame drug repurposing library using a recently developed high-throughput assay to measure sickling times following deoxygenation to 0% oxygen of red cells from sickle trait individuals. The ReFrame library is a very important collection because the compounds are either FDA-approved drugs or have been tested in clinical trials. From dose-response measurements, 106 of the 12,657 compounds exhibit statistically significant anti-sickling at concentrations ranging from 31 nM to 10 M. Compounds that inhibit sickling of trait cells are also effective with SCD cells. As many as 21 of the 106 anti-sickling compounds emerge as potential drugs. This estimate is based on a comparison of inhibitory concentrations with free concentrations of oral drugs in human serum. Moreover, the expected therapeutic effect for each level of inhibition can be predicted from measurements of sickling times for cells from individuals with sickle-syndromes of varying severity. Our results should motivate others to develop one or more of these 106 compounds into drugs for treating SCD.\n\nSignificance StatementThe vast majority of patients suffering from sickle cell disease live in under-resourced countries. Consequently, advanced medical facilities required for curative therapies, such as stem cell transplantation and gene therapy, will be unavailable to them for a long time. Hydroxyurea, approved by the FDA in 1998, is the only effective drug that inhibits polymerization of the mutant hemoglobin S that stiffens and distorts (\"sickles\") red cells, the root cause of the pathology. What is urgently needed now for these patients are additional, inexpensive oral anti-sickling drugs. Our high throughput phenotypic screen of the ReFrame drug repurposing library reported here discovered 106 compounds that are anti-sickling. On a statistical concentration basis, as many as 21 are predicted to be potential drugs.",

The two most obvious effects from this keystone species, dam construction and herbivory, have not been studied on the SPRNCA. The purpose of this research was to determine any preference for dam sites, vegetation preferences, or if beaver may travel longer distances for preferred food or dam materials. Individual dams remained or were rebuilt in the same location on average every 2.4 years. Dam building was disproportionate to availability of sites, with beaver more commonly building dams at the confluence of the San Pedro River and tributaries. The size of areas with impacts to vegetation from beaver herbivory averaged 0.34 ha (2.5 ac), containing an average of 40.7 trees. Beaver exhibited a preference for smaller-sized cottonwood (Populus fremontii) trees over larger cottonwood trees and smaller or larger Gooddings willow (Salix gooddingii), both in terms of whether trees were eaten and left standing or felled, and distance beaver travelled from water to the tree. Management implications include continued research on effects of beaver, management of invasive plant species, use of cottonwood genotypes with high tannin levels during restoration projects, further augmentation of beaver, use of beaver-dam analogues, and continued closure to hunting and trapping of beaver.",

Does such intrinsic hierarchical organization in both topography and dynamic also apply to the brains inner core itself and its higher-order cognitive functions like self? Applying multiple fMRI data sets, we show how the recently established three-layer topography of self (internal, external, mental) is already present during the resting state and carried over to task states including both task-specific and -unspecific effects. Moreover, the topographic hierarchy converges with corresponding dynamic changes (measured by power-law exponent, autocorrelation window, median frequency, sample entropy, complexity) during both rest and task states. Finally, analogous to the topographic hierarchy, we also demonstrate hierarchy among the different dynamic measures themselves according to background and foreground. Finally, we show task-specific- and un-specific effects in the hierarchies of both dynamics and topography.

    "abstract": "Palatine tonsils are secondary lymphoid organs representing the first line of immunological defense against inhaled or ingested pathogens. Here, we present a comprehensive census of cell types forming the human tonsil by applying single-cell transcriptome, epigenome, proteome and adaptive immune repertoire sequencing as well as spatial transcriptomics, resulting in an atlas of >357,000 cells. We provide a glossary of 121 annotated cell types and states, and disentangle gene regulatory mechanisms that drive cells through specialized lineage trajectories. Exemplarily, we stratify multiple tonsil-resident myeloid slancyte subtypes, establish a distant BCL6 superenhancer as locally active in both follicle-associated T and B cells, and describe SIX5 as a potentially novel transcriptional regulator of plasma cell maturation. Further, our atlas is a reference map to understand alterations observed in disease. Here, we discover immune-phenotype plasticity in tumoral cells and microenvironment shifts of mantle cell lymphomas (MCL). To facilitate such reference-based analysis, we develop HCATonsilData and SLOcatoR, a computational framework that provides programmatic and modular access to our dataset; and allows the straightforward annotation of future single-cell profiles from secondary lymphoid organs.",

    "abstract": "Venom is a complex trait with substantial inter- and intraspecific variability resulting from strong selective pressures acting on the expression of many toxic proteins. However, understanding the processes underlying the toxin expression dynamics that determine the venom phenotype remains unresolved. Here, we use comparative genomics and transcriptomics to reveal that toxin expression in sea anemones evolves rapidly with little constraint and that a single toxin family dictates the venom phenotype in each species. This dominant toxin family is characterized by massive gene duplication events. In-depth analysis of the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, revealed significant variation in the number of copies of the dominant toxin (Nv1) across populations, corresponding to significant differences in Nv1 expression at both the transcript and protein levels. These differences in Nv1 copies are driven by independent expansion events, resulting in distinct haplotypes that have a restricted geographical distribution. Strikingly, one population has undergone a severe contraction event, causing a near-complete loss of Nv1 production. Our findings across micro- and macroevolutionary scales in sea anemones complement observations of single dominant toxin family present in other venomous organisms and establishes the dominant toxin hypothesis whereby venomous animals have convergently evolved a similar strategy in shaping the venom phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic characterization of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is an emerging approach for characterizing diseases. We developed a strategy using nanopore-based single-molecule sequencing to measure cfDNA methylomes. This approach generated up to hundreds of millions of reads per cfDNA sample from cancer patients, an order of magnitude improvement over existing nanopore methods. Leveraging methylomes of matched tumors and immune cells, we characterized cfDNA methylomes of cancer patients for longitudinal monitoring during treatment.",
