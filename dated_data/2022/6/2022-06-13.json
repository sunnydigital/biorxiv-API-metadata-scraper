    "abstract": "Hyphal tip growth allows filamentous fungi to colonize space, reproduce or infect. It features remarkable morphogenetic plasticity including unusually fast elongation rates, tip turning, branching or bulging. These shape changes are all driven from the expansion of a protective cell wall (CW) secreted from apical pools of exocytic vesicles. How CW secretion, remodeling and deformation are modulated in concert to support rapid tip growth and morphogenesis while ensuring surface integrity remains poorly understood. We implemented sub-resolution imaging to map the dynamics of CW thickness and secretory vesicles in Aspergillus nidulans. We found that tip growth is associated with balanced rates of CW secretion and expansion, which limit temporal fluctuations in CW thickness, elongation speed and vesicle amount, to less than 10-15%. Affecting this balance through modulations of growth or trafficking yield to near-immediate changes in CW thickness, mechanics and shape. We developed a model with mechanical feedback which accounts for steady states of hyphal growth as well as rapid adaptation of CW mechanics and vesicle recruitment to different perturbations. These data provide unprecedented details on how CW dynamics emerges from material secretion and expansion, to stabilize fungal tip growth as well as promote its morphogenetic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal drives extinction-recolonization dynamics of metapopulations and is necessary for endangered species to recolonize former ranges. Yet few studies quantify dispersal and even fewer examine consistency of dispersal over many years. The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) provides an example of the importance of dispersal. It quickly recolonized its full range after near extirpation by 19th century hunting, and though dispersal was observed it was not quantified. Here we enumerate lifetime dispersal events among females marked as pups at two colonies during 1994-2010, then correct for detection biases to estimate bidirectional dispersal rates. An average of 16% of females born at the Piedras Blancas colony dispersed northward 200 km to breed at Ano Nuevo, while 8.0% of those born at Ano Nuevo dispersed southward to Piedras Blancas. The northward rate fluctuated considerably but was higher than southward in 15 of 17 cohorts. The population at Piedras Blancas expanded 15-fold during the study, while Ano Nuevos declined slightly, but the expectation that seals would emigrate away from high density colonies was not supported. During the 1990s, dispersal was higher away from the small colony toward the large. Moreover, cohorts born later at Piedras Blancas, when the colony had grown, dispersed no more than early cohorts. Consistently high natal dispersal in northern elephant seals means the population must be considered a single large unit in terms of response to environmental change. High dispersal was fortuitous to the past recovery of the species, and continued dispersal means elephant seals will likely expand their range further.",

    "abstract": "Many marine species have a pelagic larval phase that undergo dispersal among habitats. Studies on marine larval dispersal have revealed a large variation in the spatial scale of dispersal, and accumulated evidence has shown that seascape patchiness is the major determinant for variation in self-recruitment. However, few studies have investigated the influence of geographic settings on marine larval dispersal. Bays or lagoons generally enhance the retention of larvae, while larvae are more likely to be flushed by strong currents in open coasts. To examine associations between larval dispersal, geographic setting, and hydrodynamics, we compared fin-scale dispersal patterns, self-recruitment, and local retention of two anemonefishes (Amphiprion frenatus and A. perideraion) between a semi-enclosed bay and an open coast in the Philippines combining genetic parentage analysis and biophysical dispersal modelling. Contrary to our expectations, parentage analysis revealed lower estimates of self-recruitment in the semi-closed bay (0-2%) than in the open coast (14-15%). The result was consistent with dispersal simulations predicting lower local retention and self-recruitment in the former (0.4% and 19%) than in the latter (2.9% and 38%). Dispersal modelling also showed that cross-shore currents toward offshore were much stronger around the semi-closed bay and were negatively correlated with local retention and self-recruitment. These results suggest that stronger cross-shore currents around the semi-closed bay transport anemonefish larvae to the offshore and mainly contributed to the lower self-recruitment. Our results highlight difficulty in predicting self-recruitment from geographic setting alone and importance of hydrodynamics on it.",

The study was conducted monthly on different trawler fish landing sites from Dec 2018 to Dec 2021. During this period, we took fish samples and identified them. We took water quality data such as SST, Concentration of Chl-a, Turbidity, and DO for further correlation between the water quality and species diversity. Total 154 numbers of commercially important marine fish species were documented. Among them, 12 species are from Elasmobranch and the rest is Actinopterygii. As per the IUCN database, 13% of the total fish species are under the red list category and 16% of the species showing decreasing population trend. After analyzing the water quality data, we found out that DO, SST, Turbidity, and Chlorophyll-A correlate with the species richness and it also differs during the seasons.",

Indeed, GTA particles resemble caudoviricete virions but, in contrast to caudoviricetes (or any viruses), GTAs can encapsidate at best only part of their own genomes, are induced solely in small subpopulations of prokaryotic host cells and are transmitted vertically as part of cellular genomes during replication and division. Therefore, the lifecycles of GTAs are analogous to virus-derived entities found in parasitoid wasps, which have recently been recognized as non-virus entities and therefore reclassified as viriforms. We evaluated three distinct, independently exapted GTA groups for which the genetic basis for GTA particle production has been established.

    "abstract": "Genomic selection (GS) is the most effective method of marker-assisted selection for the genetic improvement of complex traits in plants and animals. Optimization approaches could be used in conjunction with GS to further increase its efficiency and to limit inbreeding, which can increase faster with GS. Mate selection (MS) typically uses a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, simulated annealing, to optimize the selection of individuals and their matings. However, in species with long breeding cycles, this cannot be studied empirically. Here, we investigated this aspect with forward genetic simulations on a high-performance computing cluster and massively parallel computing, considering the oil palm hybrid breeding example. We compared MS and simple methods of inbreeding management (limitation of the number of individuals selected per family, prohibition of self-fertilization and combination of these two methods), in terms of parental inbreeding and genetic progress over four generations of genomic selection and phenotypic selection. The results showed that, compared to the conventional method without optimization, MS could lead to significant decreases in inbreeding and increases in annual genetic progress, with the magnitude of the effect depending on MS parameters and breeding scenarios. The optimal solution retained by MS differed by five breeding characteristics from the conventional solution: selected individuals covering a broader range of genetic values, fewer individuals selected per full-sib family, decreased percentage of selfings, selfings preferentially made on the best individuals and unbalanced number of crosses among selected individuals, with the better an individual, the higher the number of times he is mated. Stronger slowing-down in inbreeding could be achieved with other methods but they were associated with a decreased genetic progress. We recommend that breeders use MS, with preliminary analyses to identify the proper parameters to reach the goals of the breeding program in terms of inbreeding and genetic gain.\n\nAuthor summaryOil palm is a tropical perennial plant and the world main source of vegetable fats. Oil palm breeding requires the estimation of the additive genetic value of the selection candidates to identify the best hybrid crosses, that will be released as commercial varieties. Genomic selection (GS) is a marker-assisted selection method that has the potential of boosting the rate of genetic progress for quantitative traits. However, GS could also be used in conjunction with approaches to optimize selection and mating, in order to maximize genetic progress while limiting inbreeding, which can increase faster with GS and can have negative consequences (inbreeding depression detrimental for seed production, loss of favorable alleles). This study compared several strategies to reach this goal. In particular, we considered mate selection (MS), a method that uses an algorithm optimizing the selection of individuals and their crosses. Our results showed that MS reduced inbreeding in parental populations and increased annual genetic progress. The originality of this work resides in the fact that, despite the high computational burden of MS, we applied it in a large simulated dataset and showed its efficiency in the context of genomic and conventional selection. Also, this is the first study to characterize, in terms of breeding rules, the optimized solution (i.e. the set of selected individuals and their mating design) retained by MS.",

    "abstract": "A core goal in systems neuroscience and neuroethology is to understand how neural circuits generate naturalistic behavior. One foundational idea is that complex naturalistic behavior may be composed of sequences of stereotyped behavioral syllables, which combine to generate rich sequences of actions. To investigate this, a common approach is to use autoregressive hidden Markov models (ARHMMs) to segment video into discrete behavioral syllables. While these approaches have been successful in extracting syllables that are interpretable, they fail to account for other forms of behavioral variability, such as differences in speed, which may be better described as continuous in nature. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a class of warped ARHMMs (WARHMM). As is the case in the ARHMM, behavior is modeled as a mixture of autoregressive dynamics. However, the dynamics under each discrete latent state (i.e. each behavioral syllable) are additionally modulated by a continuous latent \"warping variable.\" We present two versions of warped ARHMM in which the warping variable affects the dynamics of each syllable either linearly or nonlinearly. Using depth-camera recordings of freely moving mice, we demonstrate that the failure of ARHMMs to account for continuous behavioral variability results in duplicate cluster assignments. WARHMM achieves similar performance to the standard ARHMM while using fewer behavioral syllables. Further analysis of behavioral measurements in mice demonstrates that WARHMM identifies structure relating to response vigor.",

    "abstract": "Microplate readers are laboratory instruments used to measure biological properties and reactions within a microplate. A microplate consists of small wells in which separated reactions take place. These reactions convert the progression of biochemical processes into optical signals. A microplate reader detects these signals and quantifies a parameter of interest. Most lab-grade microplate readers can cost up to $20,000, making them unaffordable for underfunded labs and developing countries. In light of this, we developed Plate-Q, a $150 frugal microplate reader capable of quantifying green fluorescence protein and optical density of bacterial samples from 96-hole microplates. Rather than using optical sensors found in laboratory microplate readers, Plate-Q takes advantage of a Raspberry-Pi camera to capture images of a microplate and manually extract brightness values using computer vision algorithms. Plate-Q utilizes 440nm excitation lights with a 510nm emission filter to measure GFP expression and 600nm lights for optical density readings. However, camera-based technologies have three main problems: lens distortion, signal interference, and brightness calculations. Plate-Q addresses these problems through camera movement over the well-plate, image optimization, 3D printed well-plate covers and mathematical regression algorithms. In testing with fusarium dual-plasmid biosensors, Plate-Q showed comparable accuracy to commercial microplate readers with an average error of .034 and a root mean squared error of .012 for fluorescence and an average error of .045 and root mean squared error of .023 error for optical density. Users can scan for other fluorescent proteins by changing the light source and filter for different wavelengths. With all aspects of Plate-Q being open source, labs worldwide can quantify samples in an affordable and time-efficient manner.",

We achieved spatially controlled assembly of active Wnt signalosomes at the nanoscale in the plasma membrane of live cells by capturing the co-receptor Lrp6 into bNDAs via an extracellular GFP tag.

    "abstract": "Diffusion measurements by pulsed field gradient NMR and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy can be used to probe the hydrodynamic radius of proteins, which contains information about the overall dimension of a protein in solution. The comparison of this value with structural models of intrinsically disordered proteins is nonetheless impaired by the uncertainty of the accuracy of the methods for computing the hydrodynamic radius from atomic coordinates. To tackle this issue, we here build conformational ensembles of 11 intrinsically disordered proteins that we ensure are in agreement with measurements of compaction by small-angle X-ray scattering. We then use these ensembles to identify the forward model that more closely fits the radii derived from pulsed field gradient NMR diffusion experiments. Of the models we examined, we find that the Kirkwood-Riseman equation provides the best description of the hydrodynamic radius probed by pulsed field gradient NMR experiments. While some minor discrepancies remain, our results enable better use of measurements of the hydrodynamic radius in integrative modelling and for force field benchmarking and parameterization.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAccurate models of the conformational properties of intrinsically disordered proteins rely on our ability to interpret experimental data that reports on the conformational ensembles of these proteins in solution. Methods to calculate experimental observables from conformational ensembles are central to link experiments and computation, for example in integrative modelling or the assessment of molecular force fields. Benchmarking such methods is, however, difficult for disordered proteins because it is difficult to construct accurate ensembles without using the data. We here circumvent this problem by combining independent measures of protein compaction to test several methods to calculate the hydrodynamic radius of a disordered protein, as measured by pulsed field gradient NMR diffusion experiments, and find the Kirkwood-Riseman model to be most accurate.",

    "abstract": "The vascular smooth muscle (VSM) of resistance blood vessels displays intrinsic autoregulatory responses to increased intraluminal pressure, the myogenic response. In the brain, the myogenic responses of cerebral arterioles are critical to homeostatic blood flow regulation. Here we provide the first evidence to link the death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) to the myogenic response of rat and human cerebral arterioles. DAPK3 is a Ser/Thr kinase involved in Ca2+- sensitization mechanisms of VSM contraction. Ex vivo administration of a specific DAPK3 inhibitor (i.e., HS38) could attenuate vessel constrictions invoked by serotonin as well as intraluminal pressure elevation. The HS38-dependent dilation was not associated with any change in myosin light chain (LC20) phosphorylation. The results suggest that DAPK3 does not regulate Ca2+ sensitization pathways during the myogenic response of cerebral vessels but rather operates to control the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, a slow return of myogenic tone was observed during the sustained exposure of cerebral arterioles to a suite of DAPK3 inhibitors. Recovery of tone was associated with greater LC20 phosphorylation that suggests intrinsic signaling compensation in response to attenuation of DAPK3 activity. The translational importance of DAPK3 to the human cerebral vasculature was noted, with robust expression of the protein kinase and significant HS38-dependent attenuation of myogenic reactivity found for human pial vessels.",

Informed by ethnographic research with Indian farmers, veterinarians, and poultry industry representatives, we evidence that both precipitation and vapour pressure are key climate variables that relate to outbreaks of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), anthrax (AX), and black quarter (BQ) across the Indian state of Karnataka. We also identify temperature and maximum temperature to be negatively correlated with the same diseases, indicating that a cooling (but still hot) climate with wetter, humid conditions is a prime risk factor for future outbreaks. Principal component analyses have revealed the SW India monsoon and winter periods to be the most strongly correlated with HS, AX and BQ outbreaks. We identify vapour pressure, a proxy for humidity, as having a positive relationship with these specific livestock diseases. The negative relationship between temperature and these diseases, combined with the positive correlation with rainfall and humidity, allow us to classify climate-associated risk using a combination of gridded meteorological time series and epidemiological outbreak data covering the same region and timespan of 1987-2020.\n\nRisk maps were constructed following concerns over the growing impact of climate pressures raised by farmers during ethnographic study. Informed by their insights, we used current climate data and future climate projections as a risk classification tool to assess how disease risk varies in Karnataka in the present and possible future scenarios. Despite a relatively limited epidemiological dataset, clear relationships between precipitation, vapour pressure, and temperature with HS, AX and BQ, along with outbreak high-risk zones were defined. This methodology can be replicated to investigate other diseases (including in humans and plants) and other regions, irrespective of scale, as long as the climate and epidemiological data cover similar time periods. This evidence highlights the need for greater consideration of climate change in One Health research and policy and puts forward a case for, we argue, greater alignment between UNFCCC and One Health policy, for example, within the Tripartite Agreement (between OIE, FOA and WHO) on antimicrobial resistance as disease risk cannot be considered independent of climate change.\n\nOne Health Impact StatementThis research aims to investigate the relationship between factors related to climate (surface temperatures, rainfall, humidity) and outbreaks of livestock-related bacterial diseases. This is especially relevant to the One Health approach as it attempts to integrate findings between not only the science of disease but also the science of climate change as a driver of disease, and address problems that could arise within the public and private sectors (local farming, livestock health, government policy etc.). Providing spatial context to climate-associated disease risk across the Indian state of Karnataka will benefit local farmers that may already be, or transitioning to, more intensive livestock farming along with policy makers and private sector companies who are planning for future investments. This transdisciplinary approach springboards from ethnographic observations of famers lived experiences of challenges to their livelihoods and facilitates the use of climate datasets that may not have been primarily collected for or used by disease-related studies to map long-term epidemiological risk. This demonstrates the pragmatic impact that such transdisciplinary projects can have by providing interpretations of observed risks to animal health (highlighted by social scientists during engagement with practitioner communities) that Earth Scientists were then able to quantify, proving links that would be otherwise not have been evidenced. Using disease data sourced from local institutions, including Government of India facilitates as well academic research laboratories, can plan the application of pragmatic solutions to local farmers who are primarily impacted by the findings of the research.",

    "abstract": "Although we perceive the world in a continuous manner, our experience is partitioned into discrete events. However, to make sense of these events, they must be stitched together into an overarching narrative - a model of unfolding events. It has been proposed that such a stitching process happens in offline neural reactivations when rodents build models of spatial environments. Here we show that, whilst understanding a natural narrative, humans reactivate neural representations of past events. Similar to offline replay, these reactivations occur in hippocampus and default mode network, where reactivations are selective to relevant past events. However, these reactivations occur, not during prolonged offline periods, but at the boundaries between ongoing narrative events. These results, replicated across two datasets, suggest reactivations as a candidate mechanism for binding temporally distant information into a coherent understanding of ongoing experience.",

A more detailed understanding of the modulation of MC spike statistics could shed light on mechanistic studies of olfactory bulb circuits, and olfactory coding. We study the spike response of a recently developed single-compartment biophysical MC model containing 7 known ionic currents and calcium dynamics subject to constant current input with background white noise. We observe rich spiking dynamics even with constant current input, including multimodal peaks in the interspike interval distribution (ISI). Although weak to moderate background noise for a fixed current input does not change the firing rate much, the spike dynamics can change dramatically, exhibiting non-monotonic spike variability not commonly observed in standard neuron models. We explain these dynamics with a phenomenological model of the ISI probability density function. Our study clarifies some of the complexities of MC spiking dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system and increase of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) have been independently associated with the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia. However, their exact roles in triggering arrhythmia remain elusive due to a lack of appropriate human disease models. Here, using the in vitro co-culture system with sympathetic neurons, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes, we show that adipocyte-derived leptin could activate sympathetic neurons and increase the release of NPY, which in turn trigger arrhythmia of cardiomyocytes by interaction with NPY1R and subsequently enhancing the activity of NCX and CaMKII. The arrhythmic phenotype could be partially blocked by leptin neutralizing antibody, or an inhibitor of NPY1R, NCX or CaMKII. More importantly, increased EAT thickness accompanied with higher leptin/NPY blood levels was detected in atrial fibrillation patients compared to control group. Our study provides the first evidence that adipose-neural axis would contribute to arrhythmogenesis and represent a potential therapeutic target for arrhythmia.",

    "abstract": "Integration of collective cell direction and coordination is believed to ensure collective guidance for efficient movement. Previous studies demonstrated that chemokine receptors PVR and EGFR govern a gradient of Rac1 activity essential for collective guidance of Drosophila border cells, whose mechanistic insight is unknown. By monitoring and manipulating subcellular Rac1 activity, here we reveal two switchable Rac1 pools at border cell protrusions and supracellular cables, two important structures responsible for direction and coordination. Rac1 and Rho1 form a positive feedback loop that guides mechanical coupling at cables to achieve migration coordination. Rac1 cooperates with Cdc42 to control protrusion growth for migration direction, as well as to regulate the protrusion-cable exchange, linking direction and coordination. PVR and EGFR guide correct Rac1 activity distribution at protrusions and cables. Therefore, our studies emphasize the existence of a balance between two Rac1 pools, rather than a Rac1 activity gradient, as an integrator for the direction and coordination of collective cell migration.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing is now a standard method used to reveal the molecular details of cellular heterogeneity, but current approaches have limitations on speed, scale, and ease of use that stem from the complex microfluidic devices or fluid handling steps required for sample processing. We, therefore, developed a method that does not require specialized microfluidic devices, expertise, or hardware. Our approach is based on particle-templated emulsification, which allows single-cell encapsulation and barcoding of cDNA in uniform droplet emulsions with only a vortexer. PIP-seq accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes in mouse-human mixing studies, is compatible with multi-omics measurements, and can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue when compared to a commercial microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq revealed the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy-resistant cell subsets that were hidden by standard immunophenotyping. PIP-seq is a simple, flexible, and scalable next-generation workflow that extends single-cell sequencing to new applications, including screening, diagnostics, and disease monitoring.",

These models are highly dependent on the kind of data used for their construction and, as the experimental technologies evolve, it is of major importance to exploit their peculiarities. In this work we describe a cancer progression model based on Single Cell DNA Sequencing data. When constructing the model, we focus on tailoring the formalism on the specificity of the data, by defining a minimal set of assumptions to reconstruct a flexible DAG structured model, capable of identifying progression beyond the limitation of the infinite site assumption. We provide simulations and analytical results to show the features of our model, test it on real data, show how it can be integrated with other approaches to cope with input noise. Moreover, our framework can be exploited to produce simulated data that follows our theoretical assumptions. Finally, we provide an open source R implementation of our approach that is publicly available on BioConductor.",

We have also observed gradual decrease in fluorescence intensity with the increase in incubation time. Also, shift in {lambda}max of the emission spectra was recorded which clearly suggested the formation of nano-bio-conjugate.

    "abstract": "Understanding the underlying mechanisms of cognitive functions such as decision-making(DM) and working memory(WM) is always one of the most essential concerns in modern neuroscience.Recent experimental and modelling works suggest that decision-making is supported by the selective subnetwork of inhibitory neurons, rejecting the previously proposed circuit mechanisms assuming a single non-selective pool of inhibitory neurons. The mechanism underlying decision-making and working memory functions based on such circuit architecture is still unclear. Here we applied a general non-equilibrium landscape and flux approach to a biophysically based model that can perform the decision-making and working memory functions. The quantified attractor landscapes reveal that the accuracy in decision-making can be improved due to the stronger resting state in the circuit architecture with selective inhibition, while robustness of working memory against distractors is weakened, which implies a trade-off between DM and WM. We found that the presence of a ramping non-selective input during the delay period of the decision-making tasks can serve as a cost-effective mechanism of temporal gating of distractors. This temporal gating mechanism, combined with the selective-inhibition circuit architecture, can support a dynamical modulation for emphasizing the robustness or the flexibility to incoming stimuli in working memory tasks according to the cognitive task demands. These mechanisms can also achieve an optimal balance in the trade-off between DM and WM. Our approach can provide a global and physical quantification which helps to uncover the underlying mechanisms of various biological functions beyond the circuit architectures.",

Here we show that nervous system deletion of Ppm1k in mice increases BCAA levels in brain tissue but not in plasma. These mice have significant impairments in working memory accompanied by a robust accumulation of DCX+/NeuroD1+ immature neurons within the dentate gyrus granule cell layer. Through single cell RNA sequencing and pathway analysis we identified substantial increases in transit-amplifying cells and immature neurons along with activated hedgehog signaling in Ppm1k deficient primary neural stem cells (NSCs). Inhibition of mTOR signaling reversed the effects of Ppm1k deletion on neuronal progenitor gene activation in primary NSCs.

The rust Puccinia spegazzinii has been used successfully as a biological control agent in several countries to help manage M. micrantha. However, the response mechanisms of M. micrantha to P. spegazzinii infection have never been studied. To investigate the response of M. micrantha to infection by P. spegazzinii, an integrated analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics was performed. The levels of 101 metabolites, including organic acids, amino acids and secondary metabolites in M. micrantha infected with P. spegazzinii, were significantly different compared to those in plants that were not infected. The relative amounts of L-leucine, L-ioleucine, L-tryptophan, histidine, L-phenylalanine and L-citrulline were increased under P. spegazzinii infection. These may convert to intermediates within the TCA cycle, participating in energy biosynthesis. In addition, phytoalexins, such as maackiain, nobiletin, vasicin, arachidonic acid and JA-Ile, were synthesized and accumulated in M. micrantha in response to P. spegazzinii infection. A total of 4,978 differentially expressed genes were identified in M. micrantha infected by P. spegazzinii. Many key genes of the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, showed significantly higher expression under P. spegazzinii infection. These results not only help us to understand the response of metabolites and gene expression in M. micrantha following infection by P. spegazzinii, but also help us understand the potential for the continuous biological control of M. micrantha using P. spegazzinii.",

    "abstract": "The regular reappearance of coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks over the past 20 years has caused significant health consequences and financial burdens worldwide. The most recent and still ongoing novel CoV pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has brought a range of devastating consequences. Due to the exceptionally fast development of vaccines, the mortality rate of the virus has been curbed to a significant extent. However, the limitations of vaccination efficiency and applicability, coupled with the still high infection rate, emphasise the urgent need for discovering safe and effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 through suppressing its replication and or attenuating its virulence. Non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), a unique viral and conserved leader protein, is a crucial virulence factor for causing host mRNA degradation, suppressing interferon (IFN) expression and host antiviral signalling pathways. In view of the essential role of nsp1 in the CoV life cycle, it is regarded as an exploitable target for antiviral drug discovery. Here, we report a variety of fragment hits against SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 identified by fragment-based screening via X-ray crystallography. We also determined the structure of nsp1 at atomic resolution (0.95 [A]). Binding affinities of hits against nsp1 were determined by orthogonal biophysical assays such as microscale thermophoresis and thermal sift assays. We identified two ligand-binding sites on nsp1, one deep and one shallow pocket, which are not conserved between the three medially relevant SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS coronaviruses. Our study provides an excellent starting point for the development of more potent nsp1-targeting inhibitors and functional studies on SARS-CoV-2 nsp1.",

The development of vaccines that elicit robust, broad, and durable protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed. We have developed a vaccine (rDIs-S) consisting of the attenuated vaccinia virus DIs strain platform carrying the SARS-CoV-2 S gene. rDIs-S induced neutralizing antibody and T-lymphocyte responses in cynomolgus macaques and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice, and showed broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 isolates ranging from the early-pandemic strain (WK-521) to the recent Omicron BA. 1 variant (TY38-839). Using a tandem mass tag (TMT) -based quantitative proteomic analysis of lung homogenates from hACE2 transgenic mice, we found that, among mice subjected to challenge infection with WK-521, vaccination with rDIs-S prevented protein expression related to the severe pathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection (tissue destruction, inflammation, coagulation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis) and restored protein expression related to immune responses (antigen presentation and cellular response to stress). Furthermore, long-term studies in mice showed that rDIs-S maintains S protein-specific antibody titers for at least 6 months after a 1st vaccination. Thus, rDIs-S appears to provide broad and durable protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, including current and possibly future variants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an explosion of sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, making it the most widely sequenced virus in the history. Several databases and tools have been created to keep track of genome sequences and variants of the virus, most notably the GISAID platform hosts millions of complete genome sequences, and it is continuously expanding every day. A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign them to a clade.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we leverage the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop an original method that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. On a testing subset of the GISAID, CouGaR-g achieves an 96.29% overall accuracy, while a similar tool, Covidex, obtained a 77, 12% overall accuracy. As far as we know, our method is the first using Deep Learning and FCGR for intra-species classification. Furthermore, by using some feature importance methods CouGaR-g allows to identify k-mers that matches SARS-CoV-2 marker variants.\n\nConclusionsBy combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on Random Forest) for clade assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants.\n\nAvailabilityThe trained models can be tested online providing a FASTA file (with one or multiple sequences) at https://huggingface.co/spaces/BIASLab/sars-cov-2-classification-fcgr. CouGaR-g is also available at https://github.com/AlgoLab/CouGaR-g under the GPL.",

A comprehensive understanding of the evolution and natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 against the host interaction and symptoms at the phenotype level could impact the candidates strategies for the fight against this virus.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Mutation (SARS2Mutant, http://sars2mutant.com/) is a database thatprovides comprehensive analysis results based on tens of thousands of high-coverage and high-quality SARS-CoV-2 complete protein sequences. The structure of this database is designed to allow the users to search for the three different strategies among amino acid substitution mutations based on gene name, geographical zone or comparative analysis. Based on each strategy, five data types are available to the user: mutated sample frequencies, heat map of the mutated amino acid positions, timeline trend for mutation survivals and natural selections, and charts of changed amino acids and their frequencies. Due to the increase of virus protein sequence samples published daily showing the latest trends of current results, all sequences in the database are reanalyzed and updated monthly. The SARS-2Mutant database providescurrent analysis and updated data of mutation patterns and conserved regions, helpful in developing and designing targeted vaccines, primers and drug discoveries.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins incorporated into virions, spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M). M plays an essential role in viral assembly by organizing other structural proteins through physical interactions and directing them to sites of viral budding. As the most abundant protein in the viral envelope and a target of patient antibodies, M is a compelling target for vaccines and therapeutics. Still, the structure of M and molecular basis for its role in virion formation are unknown. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 M in lipid nanodiscs to 3.5 [A] resolution. M forms a 50 kDa homodimer that is structurally related to the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a viroporin, suggesting a shared ancestral origin. Structural comparisons reveal how intersubunit gaps create a small, enclosed pocket in M and large open cavity in ORF3a, consistent with a structural role and ion channel activity, respectively. M displays a strikingly electropositive cytosolic surface that may be important for interactions with N, S, and viral RNA. Molecular dynamics simulations show a high degree of structural rigidity and support a role for M homodimers in scaffolding viral assembly. Together, these results provide insight into roles for M in coronavirus assembly and structure.",

    "abstract": "Dependence on multiple nutritional bacterial symbionts forming a metabolic unit has repeatedly evolved in many insect species that feed on nutritionally unbalanced diets such as plant sap. This is the case for aphids of the subfamilies Lachninae and Chaitophorinae, which have evolved di-symbiotic systems in which the ancient obligate nutritional symbiont Buchnera aphidicola is metabolically complemented by an additional nutritional symbiont acquired more recently. Deciphering how different symbionts integrate both metabolically and anatomically in such systems is crucial to understanding how complex nutritional symbiotic systems function and evolve. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of the symbionts B. aphidicola and Serratia symbiotica associated with the Chaitophorinae aphids Sipha maydis and Periphyllus lyropictus. Our results show that, in these two species, B. aphidicola and S. symbiotica complement each other metabolically (and their hosts) for the biosynthesis of essential amino acids and vitamins but with distinct metabolic reactions supported by each symbiont depending on the host species. Furthermore, the S. symbiotica symbiont associated with S. maydis appears to be strictly compartmentalized into the specialized host cells housing symbionts in aphids, the bacteriocytes, whereas the S. symbiotica symbiont associated with P. lyropictus exhibits a highly invasive phenotype, presumably because it is capable of expressing a larger set of virulence factors, including a complete flagellum for bacterial motility. Such contrasting levels of metabolic and anatomical integration for two S. symbiotica symbionts that were recently acquired as nutritional co-obligate partners reflect distinct coevolutionary processes specific to each association.",

The proliferation of TEs within the genome occurred in several bursts and correlates with the radiation and speciation of the legumes. We present data of clear de-repression of TEs that mirrors expression of virulence-related candidate effectors. We can see a unique expansion in amino acid metabolism for this fungus.

    "abstract": "The application of CRISPR/Cas9 to improve genome engineering efficiency of large dsDNA viruses has been extensively described, but a robust and versatile method for high-throughput generation of marker-free recombinants for a desire locus has not been reported yet. Cytoplasmic-replicating viruses use their own repair enzymes for homologous recombination, while nuclear-replicating viruses use the host repair machinery. This is translated into a wide range of Cas9-induced homologous recombination efficiency depending on the virus replication compartment and viral/host repair machinery characteristics and accessibility. However, the use of Cas9 as a selection agent to target parental virus genomes robustly improves the selection of desired recombinants across large dsDNA viruses. We used ectromelia virus (ECTV) and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type 1 and 2, to optimize a CRISPR/Cas9 method that can be versatilely used for efficient genome editing and selection of both cytoplasmic- and nuclear-replicating viruses. We performed a genome-wide genetic variant analysis of mutations located at predicted off-target sequences for 20 different recombinants, showing off-target-free accuracy by deep-sequencing. Our results support this optimized method as an efficient, accurate and versatile approach to enhance the two critical factors of high-throughput viral genome engineering: generation and color-based selection of recombinants. This application of CRISPR/Cas9 reduces time and labor of screening of desired recombinants, allowing for high-throughput generation of large collections of mutant dsDNA viruses for a desire locus in less than two weeks.\n\nDATA SUMMARYRaw sequence reads are available at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) as Bioproject ID PRJEB32151 and PRJEB32152.\n\nSix supplementary figures, eleven supplementary tables and supplementary methods are available with the online version of this article.

Even after six decades of study, fundamental details of its predation cycle remain mysterious. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography to comprehensively image the lifecycle of B. bacteriovorus at nanometer-scale resolution. In addition to providing the first high-resolution images of predation in a native (hydrated, unstained) state, we also discover several surprising features of the process, including novel macromolecular complexes involved in prey attachment/invasion and a flexible portal structure lining a hole in the prey peptidoglycan that tightly seals the prey outer membrane around the predator during entry. Unexpectedly, we find that B. bacteriovorus does not shed its flagellum during invasion, but rather resorbs it into its periplasm for degradation. Finally, following replication and division in the bdelloplast, we observe a transient and extensive ribosomal lattice on the condensed B. bacteriovorus nucleoid.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496000v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35da74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19923f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@106a616org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@181f2fb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Several RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems (e.g., types III and VI) cause Abi phenotypes by activating indiscriminate RNases3-5. However, a CRISPR-mediated abortive mechanism that relies on indiscriminate DNase activity has yet to be observed. Here we report that RNA targeting by the type V Cas12a2 nuclease drives abortive infection through non-specific cleavage of double-stranded (ds)DNA. Upon recognition of an RNA target with an activating protospacer-flanking sequence, Cas12a2 efficiently degrades single-stranded (ss)RNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA. Within cells, the dsDNase activity induces an SOS response and impairs growth, stemming the infection. Finally, we harnessed the collateral activity of Cas12a2 for direct RNA detection, demonstrating that Cas12a2 can be repurposed as an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting tool. These findings expand the known defensive capabilities of CRISPR-Cas systems and create additional opportunities for CRISPR technologies.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) utilizes cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol) to transcribe its genes in one of two phases. In the latent phase, viral transcription is highly restricted but during the productive lytic phase, more than 80 genes are expressed in a temporally coordinated cascade. In this study, we used precision nuclear Run On followed by deep Sequencing (PRO-Seq) to characterize early viral transcriptional events using HSV-1 immediate early (IE) gene mutants, corresponding genetically repaired viruses, and wild type virus. Unexpectedly, in the absence of the IE genes ICP4, ICP22 or ICP0 at 1.5 hpi we observed high levels of aberrant transcriptional activity across the mutant viral genomes, but substantially less on either wild type or the congenic repaired virus genomes. This feature was particularly prominent in the absence of ICP4 expression. Cycloheximide treatment during infection with both the ICP4 and ICP22 mutants and their respective genetic repairs did not alter the relative distribution of Pol activity, but increased overall activity across both viral genomes, indicating that both virion components and at least some de novo protein synthesis were required for full repression. Overall, these data reveal that prior to their role in transcriptional activation, IE gene products and virion components first repress transcription and that the HSV-1 lytic transcriptional cascade is mediated through subsequent de-repression steps.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) transcription during productive replication is believed to comprise a series of activation steps leading to a specific sequence of gene expression. Here we show that virion components and immediate early (IE) gene products ICP0, ICP4 and ICP22 first repress viral gene transcription to varying degrees before subsequently activating specific gene subsets. It follows that the entire HSV transcriptional program involves a series of steps to sequentially reverse this repression. This previously uncharacterized repressive activity of IE genes very early in infection may represent an important checkpoint allowing HSV-1 to orchestrate either the robust lytic transcriptional cascade or the more restricted transcriptional program during latency.",

We compared genomes of four Wolbachia strains derived from Homona magnanima, a male-killing strain wHm-t (1.5 Mb), and three non-male-killing strains, wHm-a (1.1 Mb), wHm-b (1.3 Mb), and wHm-c (1.4 Mb). A wHm-t-specific 76-kbp prophage region harboured two tandemly arrayed WO-mediated killing (wmk) gene homologs (wmk-1/wmk-2 and wmk-3/wmk-4). Of these, wmk-1 or wmk-3 killed almost all Drosophila melanogaster individuals when transgenically overexpressed. Dual expression of wmk-3 and wmk-4 killed all males and rescued females. We propose a novel hypothesis wherein horizontally transmitted proto-Wolbachia with a single wmk killed both sexes, and tandem duplication of wmk allowed an evolutionary transition to a vertically transmitted symbiont, causing male-killing. Our study highlights the bacteriophage as a critical driver of the evolution of male-killing and argues for a conserved male-killing mechanism in diverse insects.",

All known inhibitors target the outward-open state except ibogaine, which has an unusual anti-depressant profile and stabilizes the inward-open conformation. Unfortunately, ibogaine is promiscuous and cardiotoxic, limiting understanding of inward-open state ligands. We computationally docked over 200 million small molecules against the ibogaine stabilized inward-open state of SERT. Thirty-six top-ranking compounds were synthesized and thirteen inhibited with potencies ranging from 29 to 5000 nM. Structure-based optimization led to two novel inhibitors with Ki values down to 3 nM. The new molecules stabilized an outward-closed state of the transporter and had little activity against off-targets. A cryo-EM structure of one of these bound to SERT confirmed the predicted geometry. In mouse behavioral assays, both had anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity, with potencies up to 200 better than fluoxetine.",

    "abstract": "Chemical modifications to protein encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) can modulate their localization, translation and stability within cells. Over 15 different types of mRNA modifications have been identified by sequencing and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technologies. While LC-MS/MS is arguably the most essential tool available for studying analogous protein post-translational modifications, the high-throughput discovery and quantitative characterization of mRNA modifications by LC-MS/MS has been hampered by the difficulty of obtaining sufficient quantities of pure mRNA and limited sensitivities for modified nucleosides. To overcome these challenges, we improved the mRNA purification and LC-MS/MS pipelines to identify new S. cerevisiae mRNA modifications and quantify 50 ribonucleosides in a single analysis. The methodologies we developed result in no detectable non-coding RNA modifications signals in our purified mRNA samples and provide the lowest limit of detection reported for ribonucleoside modification LC-MS/MS analyses. These advancements enabled the detection and quantification of 13 S. cerevisiae mRNA ribonucleoside modifications and revealed four new S. cerevisiae mRNA modifications at low to moderate levels (1-methyguanosine, N2-methylguanosine, N2, N2-dimethylguanosine, and 5-methyluridine). We identified four enzymes that incorporate these modifications into S. cerevisiae mRNAs (Trm10, Trm11, Trm1, and Trm2), though our results suggest that guanosine and uridine nucleobases are also non-enzymatically methylated at low levels. Regardless of whether they are incorporated in a programmed manner or as the result of RNA damage, we reasoned that the ribosome will encounter the modifications that we detect in cells and used a reconstituted translation system to discern the consequences of modifications on translation elongation. Our findings demonstrate that the introduction of 1-methyguanosine, N2-methylguanosine and 5-methyluridine into mRNA codons impedes amino acid addition in a position dependent manner. This work expands the repertoire of nucleoside modifications that the ribosome must decode in S. cerevisiae. Additionally, it highlights the challenge of predicting the effect of discrete modified mRNA sites on translation de novo because individual modifications influence translation differently depending on mRNA sequence context.",

Here, we report structures of Cas12a2 in binary, ternary, and quaternary complexes to reveal a complete activation pathway. Our structures reveal that Cas12a2 is autoinhibited until binding a cognate RNA target, which exposes the RuvC active site within a large, positively charged cleft. Double-stranded DNA substrates are captured through duplex distortion and local melting, stabilized by pairs of  aromatic clamp residues that are crucial for dsDNA degradation and in vivo immune system function. Our work provides a structural basis for this unprecedented mechanism of abortive infection to achieve population-level immunity, which can be leveraged to create rational mutants that degrade a spectrum of collateral substrates.",

    "abstract": "The development of live-cell fluorescence nanoscopy is powered by the availability of suitable fluorescent probes. Rhodamines are among the best fluorophores for labeling intracellular structures. Isomeric tuning is a powerful method for optimizing biocompatibility of the rhodamine-containing probes without affecting their spectral properties. However, the efficient synthesis pathway for rhodamine 4-isomers is still lacking. Herein, we present a facile protecting-group-free 4-carboxyrhodamines synthesis based on nucleophilic addition of lithium dicarboxybenzenide to the corresponding xanthone. This approach drastically reduces the number of synthesis steps and expands the achievable structural diversity, increases overall yields and permits a cheap gram-scale synthesis of the dyes. We prepared a wide range of symmetric and asymmetric 4-carboxyrhodamines covering the whole visible spectrum and targeted them to multiple structures in living cells - microtubules, DNA, actin, mitochondria, lysosomes, Halo-tagged and SNAP-tagged proteins. The enhanced permeability fluorescent probes operate at submicromolar concentrations allowing high contrast STED and confocal microscopy of living cells and tissues.",

    "abstract": "B-Myb is a highly conserved member of the vertebrate Myb family of transcription factors that plays a critical role in cell-cycle progression and proliferation. Myb proteins activate Myb-dependent promoters by interacting specifically with Myb binding site (MBS) sequences using their DNA binding domain (DBD). Transactivation of MBS promoters by B-Myb is repressed by its negative regulatory domain (NRD), and phosphorylation of the NRD by Cdk2-CyclinA relieves the repression to activate B-Myb dependent promoters. The structural mechanisms underlying autoinhibition and activation have been poorly characterized. We determined that a region in the B-Myb NRD (residues 510-600) directly associates with the DBD and inhibits DBD binding to the MBS DNA sequence. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of the NRD at T515, T518, and T520 is sufficient to disrupt the interaction between the NRD and the DBD, which results in increased affinity for MBS DNA and increased B-Myb-dependent promoter activation. Our biochemical characterization of B-Myb autoregulation and the activating effects of phosphorylation provides insight into how B-Myb functions as a site-specific transcription factor.",

    "abstract": "Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are enzymes that are uniquely adapted to promote the formation of a glycosidic bond between a sugar molecule and a wide variety of substrates. Heptosyltransferase II (HepII) is a GT involved in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthetic pathway that transfers the seven-carbon sugar (L-glycero-D-manno-heptose; Hep) onto a lipid anchored glycopolymer (heptosylated Kdo2-Lipid A, Hep-Kdo2-Lipid A or HLA). LPS plays a key role in Gram-negative bacterial sepsis as a stimulator of the human immune response and has been used as an adjuvant in vaccines. As such, ongoing efforts towards inhibition of LPS biosynthetic enzymes to aid development of novel antimicrobial therapeutics has driven significant effort towards the characterization of these enzymes. Three heptosyltransferases are involved in the inner-core biosynthesis, with E. coli HepII being the last to be quantitatively characterized in vivo, as described herein. HepII shares modest sequence similarity with heptosyltransferase I (HepI) while maintaining a high degree of structural homology. Here we report the first kinetic and biophysical characterization of HepII and demonstrate the properties of HepII that are shared by HepI to include sugar donor promiscuity, and sugar acceptor induced secondary structural changes which results in significant thermal stabilization. HepII also has an increased catalytic efficiency and a significantly tighter binding affinity for both of its substrates, with an insensitivity to the number of acyl chains on the sugar acceptor. Additionally, a structural model of the HepII ternary complex, refined by molecular dynamics simulations, was developed to probe potentially important substrate-protein contacts and revealed the potential of Tryptophan (Trp) residues responsible for reporting on ligand binding. As was previously described for HepI, Tryptophan fluorescence in HepII allowed observation of substrate induced changes in Trp fluorescence intensity which enabled determination of substrate dissociation constants. Combined, these efforts meaningfully enhance our understanding of the Heptosyltransferase family of enzymes and will aid in future efforts to design novel, potent and specific inhibitors for this family of enzymes.",

    "abstract": "A challenge in the design and construction of synthetic genetic circuits is that they will operate within biological systems that have noisy and changing parameter regimes that are largely unmeasurable. The outcome is that these circuits do not operate within design specifications or have a narrow operational envelope in which they can function. This behavior is often observed as a lack of reproducibility in function from day to day or lab to lab. Moreover, this narrow range of operating conditions does not promote reproducible circuit function in deployments where environmental conditions for the chassis are changing, as environmental changes can affect the parameter space in which the circuit is operating. Here we describe a computational method for assessing the robustness of circuit function across broad parameter regions. Previously designed circuits are assessed by this computational method and then circuit performance is measured across multiple growth conditions in budding yeast. The computational predictions are correlated with experimental findings, suggesting that the approach has predictive value for assessing the robustness of a circuit design.",

    "abstract": "Kingella kingae is a leading cause of bone and joint infections and other invasive diseases in young children. A key K. kingae virulence determinant is a secreted exopolysaccharide that mediates resistance to serum complement and neutrophils and is required for full pathogenicity. The K. kingae exopolysaccharide is a galactofuranose homopolymer called galactan and is encoded by the pamABC genes in the pamABCDE locus. In this study, we sought to define the mechanism by which galactan is tethered on the bacterial surface, a prerequisite for mediating evasion of host immune mechanisms. We found that the pamD and pamE genes are glycosyltransferases and are required for synthesis of an atypical lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen. The LPS O-antigen in turn is required for anchoring of galactan, a novel mechanism for association of an exopolysaccharide with the bacterial surface.\n\nSignificanceKingella kingae is an emerging pediatric pathogen and produces invasive disease by colonizing the oropharynx, invading the bloodstream, and disseminating to distant sites. This organism produces a uniquely multifunctional exopolysaccharide called galactan that is critical for virulence and promotes intravascular survival by mediating resistance to serum and neutrophils. In this study, we established that at least some galactan is anchored to the bacterial surface via a novel structural interaction with an atypical lipopolysaccharide O-antigen. Additionally, we demonstrated that the atypical O-antigen is synthesized by the pamD and pamE genes, located downstream of the gene cluster responsible for galactan biosynthesis. This work addresses how the K. kingae exopolysaccharide can mediate innate immune resistance and advances understanding of bacterial exopolysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides.",

    "abstract": "We have recently shown that the replication of rhinovirus, poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus requires the co-translational N-myristoylation of viral proteins by human host cell N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs), and is inhibited by treatment with IMP-1088, an ultrapotent small molecule NMT inhibitor. Here, we reveal the role of N-myristoylation during vaccinia virus (VACV) infection in human host cells and demonstrate the anti-poxviral effects of IMP-1088. N-myristoylated proteins from VACV and the host were metabolically labelled with myristic acid alkyne during infection using quantitative chemical proteomics. We identified VACV proteins A16, G9 and L1 to be N-myristoylated. Treatment with NMT inhibitor IMP-1088 potently abrogated VACV infection, while VACV gene expression, DNA replication, morphogenesis and EV formation remained unaffected. Importantly, we observed that loss of N-myristoylation resulted in greatly reduced infectivity of assembled mature virus particles, characterized by significantly reduced host cell entry and a decline in membrane fusion activity of progeny virus. While the N-myristoylation of VACV entry proteins L1, A16 and G9 was inhibited by IMP-1088, mutational and genetic studies demonstrated that the N-myristoylation of L1 was the most critical for VACV entry. Given the significant genetic identity between VACV, monkeypox virus and variola virus L1 homologs, our data provides a basis for further investigating the role of N-myristoylation in poxviral infections as well as the potential of selective NMT inhibitors like IMP-1088 as broad-spectrum poxvirus inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Microbial breakdown of carbon polymers is an essential process in all ecosystems. Carbon polymers generally require extracellular breakdown by secreted exoenzymes. Exoenzymes and breakdown products can be lost through diffusion or flow. This diffusional loss is reduced when bacteria grow in surface-associated populations where they benefit from each others metabolic activities. The aquatic organism Caulobacter crescentus was recently shown to form clonal microcolonies on the carbon polymer xylan, but to grow solitary on the monosaccharide xylose. The underlying mechanisms of this substrate-mediated microcolony formation are unknown. In particular, the importance of extracellular appendages such as pili, adhesive holdfast, and flagellum in governing the spatial arrangement of surface-grown cells is unclear. Using microfluidics coupled to automated time-lapse microscopy and quantitative image analysis, we compared the temporal and spatial dynamics of C. crescentus wildtype and mutant strains grown on xylan, xylose, or glucose. We found that mutants lacking type IV pili or holdfast showed altered spatial patterns in microcolonies and were unable to maintain cell densities above a threshold required for maximal growth rates on the xylan polymer, whereas mutants lacking flagella showed increased cell densities that potentially lead to increased local competition. Our results demonstrate that extracellular appendages allow bacteria to reach local cell densities that maximize single-cell growth rates in response to their nutrient environment.",

    "abstract": "CCR4-NOT is a versatile eukaryotic protein complex that controls multiple steps in gene expression regulation from synthesis to decay. In yeast, CCR4-NOT has been implicated in stress response regulation, though this function in other organisms remains unclear. In a genome-wide RNAi screen, we identified a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, ccf-1, as a requirement for the C. elegans transcriptional response to cadmium and acrylamide stress. Using whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, we show that knockdown of ccf-1 attenuates the activation of a broad range of stress protective genes in response to cadmium and acrylamide, including those encoding heat shock proteins and glutathione s-transferases. Consistently, survival assays show that knockdown of ccf-1 decreases C. elegans stress resistance. A yeast-2-hybrid screen using a CCF-1 bait identified the homeobox transcription factor PAL-1 as a physical interactor. Knockdown of pal-1 inhibits the activation of ccf-1 dependent stress genes and reduces C. elegans stress resistance. Gene expression analysis reveals that knockdown of pal-1 down-regulates the mRNA levels of elt-2 and elt-3, which serves as the master transcriptional co-regulators of stress response in the C. elegans intestinal and epidermal tissues respectively. These results reveal a new role for CCR4-NOT in stress response regulation with PAL-1 through the transcriptional control of elt-2 and elt-3 in C. elegans.",
