    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays diverse roles in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. In the mammalian brain it has been linked to developmental processes and memory function. However, the precise role of m6A in the context synaptic plasticity and especially during impaired cognition are not fully understood. Here, we describe the mouse and human brain m6A epi-transcriptome in a tissue-specific manner. We furthermore show that m6A levels undergo a massive decrease across mouse brain regions as a consequence of aging. In addition, Alzheimer's disease in humans correlates with decreased N6-methylation in a similar population of transcripts that are linked to synaptic function and localized to synapses, such as the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). We furthermore show that reduced m6A levels impair synaptic protein-synthesis of CAMKII. Our results suggest that m6A-RNA-methylation is an important mechanism to control synaptic protein synthesis which is affected early in cognitive diseases.\n\nSignificance statementThe addition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) to RNA plays a role in various cellular processes and its de-regulation has been linked to several devastating diseases. The precise role of m6A RNA-methylation in the adult brain is, however, not well understood. In our study, we describe the genome-wide m6A epi-transcriptome in the healthy and diseased brains of mice and humans. Our data demonstrate that a substantial amount of m6A transcripts are conserved. These transcripts are linked to the regulation of synaptic processes and are localized to synapses. In the diseases brain we detect RNA hypomethylation across multiple transcripts in all investigated brain regions and across species. At the mechanistic level we find that reduced m6A levels specifically impairs synaptic protein-synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the abnormal accumulation of -synuclein (-syn) aggregates. Central to disease progression is the gradual spread of pathological -syn. -syn aggregation is closely linked to progressive neuron loss. As such, clearance of -syn aggregates may slow the progression of PD and lead to less severe symptoms. Evidence that non-neuronal cells play a role in PD and other synucleinopathies such as Lewy body dementia and multiple system atrophy are increasing. Our previous work has shown that pericytes -- vascular mural cells that regulate the blood-brain barrier -- contain -syn aggregates in human PD brains. Here, we demonstrate that pericytes efficiently internalise fibrillar -syn irrespective of being in a monoculture or mixed neuronal cell culture. Pericytes efficiently break down -syn aggregates in vitro, with clear differences in the number of -syn aggregates/cell and average aggregate size when comparing five pure -syn strains (Fibrils, Ribbons, fibrils65, fibrils91 and fibrils110). Furthermore, pericytes derived from PD brains have a less uniform response than those derived from control brains. Our results highlight the vital role brain vasculature may play in reducing -syn burden in PD.",

Even across independent trials, current-trial perception can be automatically shifted by preceding trials, namely the  serial bias. Meanwhile, the neural implementation of the spontaneous shift of present by past that operates on multiple features remains unknown. In two auditory categorization experiments with human electrophysiology recordings, we demonstrate that serial bias arises from the co-occurrence of past-trial neural reactivation and the neural encoding of current-trial features. The meeting of past and present shifts the neural representation of current-trial features and modulates serial bias behavior. Critically, past-trial features (i.e., pitch, category, motor response) that constitute an  event-file keep their respective identities in working memory and are only reactivated by the corresponding features in the current trial, giving rise to dissociated feature-specific serial biases. This event-file reactivation might constitute a fundamental mechanism for adaptive past-to-present generalizations over multiple features.",

    "abstract": "The quality of a childs social and physical environment is a key influence on brain development, educational attainment and mental wellbeing. However, there still remains a mechanistic gap in our understanding of how environmental influences converge on changes in the brains developmental trajectory. In a sample of 145 children with structural diffusion tensor imaging data, we used generative network modelling to simulate the emergence of whole brain network organisation. We then applied data-driven clustering to stratify the sample according to socio-economic disadvantage, with one of the resulting clusters containing mostly children living below the poverty line. A formal comparison of the simulated networks from the generative model revealed that the computational principles governing network formation were subtly different for children experiencing socio-economic disadvantage, and that this resulted in significantly altered developmental timing of network modularity emergence. Children in the low socio-economic status (SES) group had a significantly slower time to peak modularity, relative to the higher SES group (t(69) = 3.02, P = 3.50 x 10-4, d = 0.491). In a subsequent simulation we showed that the alteration in generative properties increases the variability in wiring probabilities during network formation (KS test: D = 0.012, P < 0.001). One possibility is that multiple environmental influences such as stress, diet and environmental stimulation impact both the systematic coordination of neuronal activity and biological resource constraints, converging on a shift in the economic conditions under which networks form. Alternatively, it is possible that this stochasticity reflects an adaptive mechanism that creates \"resilient\" networks better suited to unpredictable environments.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe used generative network models to simulate macroscopic brain network development in a sample of 145 children. Within these models, network connections form probabilistically depending on the estimated \"cost\" of forming a connection, versus topological \"value\" that the connection would confer. Tracking the formation of the network across the simulation, we could establish the changes in global brain organisation measures such as integration and segregation. Simulations for children experiencing socio-economic disadvantage were associated with a shift in emergence of a topologically valuable network property, namely modularity.",

However, the verisimilitude of quantitative conclusions drawn from these experiments is largely unknown.

Here we present an experimental dataset with a broad range of starter cell numbers and explore their relationship with the number of input cells across the brain using descriptive statistics and modelling. We show that starter cell numbers strongly affect input fraction and convergence index measures, making quantitative comparisons unreliable.

    "abstract": "Despite their phylogenetic differences and distinct pallial structures, mammals and birds show similar electroencephalography (EEG) traces during sleep, consisting of distinct rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) stages. Studies in human and a limited number of other mammalian species shows that this organization of sleep into interleaving stages undergoes radical changes during lifetime. Do these age-dependent variations in sleep patterns also occur in the avian brain? Does vocal learning have an effect on sleep patterns in birds? To answer this question, we recorded multi-channel sleep EEG from juveniles and adult zebra finches for several nights. Whereas adults spent more time in SWS and REM sleep, juveniles spent more time in intermediate sleep (IS). The amount of IS sleep was significantly larger in male juveniles engaged in vocal learning compared to female juveniles, which suggest that IS sleep could be important for learning. In addition, we observed that the functional connectivity increased rapidly during maturation of young juveniles, and was stable or declined at older ages. Synchronous activity during sleep was larger for recording sites in the left hemisphere for both juveniles and adults, and generally intra-hemispheric synchrony was larger than inter-hemispheric synchrony during sleep. A graph theory analysis revealed that in adults, highly correlated EEG activity tends to be distributed across fewer networks that are spread across a wider area of the brain, whereas in juveniles, highly correlated EEG activity is distributed across more numerous, albeit smaller, networks in the brain. Overall, our results reveal significant changes in the neural signatures of sleep during maturation in an avian brain.",

    "abstract": "Early adversity can change educational, cognitive, and mental health outcomes. However, the neural processes through which early adversity exerts these effects remain largely unknown. We used generative network modelling of the mouse connectome to test whether unpredictable postnatal stress shifts the constraints that govern the formation of the structural connectome. A model that trades off the wiring cost of long-distance connections with topological homophily (i.e. links between regions with shared neighbours) generated simulations that replicate the organisation of the rodent connectome. The imposition of early life adversity significantly shifted the best-performing parameter combinations toward zero, heightening the stochastic nature of the generative process. Put simply, unpredictable postnatal stress changes the economic constraints that shape network formation, introducing greater randomness into the structural development of the brain. While this change may constrain the development of cognitive abilities, it could also reflect an adaptive mechanism. In other words, neural development could harness heightened stochasticity to make networks more robust to perturbation, thereby facilitating effective responses to future threats and challenges.\n\nSignificance statementChildren who experience adversity early in life - such as chronic poverty or abuse - show numerous neural differences that are linked to poorer cognition and mental health later in life. To effectively mitigate the burden of adversity, it is critical to identify how these differences arise. In this paper, we use computational modelling to test whether growing up in an impoverished and unpredictable environment changes the development of structural connections in the mouse brain. We found that early adversity appears to introduce more stochasticity in the formation of neural architecture. Our findings point to a potential mechanism for how early adversity could change the course of child development.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that nutrient enrichment causes the loss of plant diversity in different grasslands across the globe. Thus far, three main hypotheses (niche dimension, competitive asymmetry, and soil acidification) have been proposed to account for this general phenomenon, but our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms remains rather vague. To reveal the cryptic mechanisms, we analyzed the famous long-term Park Grass Experiment (1856-) under modern coexistence theory by fitting Lotka-Volterra competition models with time-series data from the different treatments (15 different combinations of nutrient addition fully crossed with four levels of soil pH) to quantitatively test the three competing hypotheses. Supportive of the competitive asymmetry and soil acidification hypotheses, both nutrient addition and soil acidification overall decreased intrinsic population growth rates (r) and intensified competitive differences or asymmetries dramatically, which mostly favored grasses over forbs and legumes (and also forbs over legumes). These changes in r and competitive differences or asymmetries are generally consistent with the abundance changes of different functional groups following the various treatments. Moreover, the altered r (determining species existence) and competitive differences (affecting species coexistence) effectively explained the diversity loss and recovery (after nitrogen addition was withheld). However, while nutrient addition significantly decreased per-capita intra- and inter-specific competition (which indicates that belowground competition becomes less important when soil nutrients are more abundant), it did not decrease niche differences as predicted, poorly supporting the niche dimension hypothesis. These findings advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms driving the response of plant communities to nutrient deposition in nature.\n\nSignificance StatementAn unresolved fundamental scientific mystery with the crucial applied value in ecology is what causes the general loss of biodiversity following nutrient enrichment in the Anthropocene. In this study, we combined the recent advance in coexistence theory with the longest-running experiment existing in the world to wrestle with this conundrum. Our major results, which highlight the critical role of both existence and coexistence, are helpful in settling the debate between the three popular hypotheses and also, for the first time, provide quantitative explanations for the general findings in numerous nutrient-addition experiments. Our study shows the importance of applying modern coexistence theory to more quantitatively explain, predict and cope with the responses of ecological communities to global change factors in nature.",

However, human inference comes with costs due to its associated biases and limited precision. Indeed, biased or imprecise inference can trigger variable beliefs and unwarranted changes in behavior.

Instead of integrating the evidence provided by all stimuli, participants actively discarded as much as a third of stimuli. This conditional belief updating strategy shows good test-retest reliability, correlates with perceptual confidence, and explains human behavior better than previously described strategies. This seemingly suboptimal strategy not only reduces the costs of imprecise computations, but counter-intuitively increases the accuracy of resulting decisions.",

Assessing the susceptibility of a previously unexposed European flora is a key element that remains widely unknown. Under biosafety facility, we evaluated the susceptibility of Salicaceae such as Populus tremula, Populus canescens, Salix alba and Salix caprea by mechanically inoculating the KLN59.3 GFP-labelled X. fastidiosa at 22 {degrees}C and at 28 {degrees}C. Bacterial movement and multiplication in plants were investigated by PCR, real-time PCR, confocal or scanning electron microscopy. Nine months post-inoculation, 100 % of the plants tested positive for X. fastidiosa, with the exception of 57% for P. canescens under the 22 {degrees}C-growing conditions. Bacteria were detected up to 120 cm from the inoculation point for S. alba. They were detected in the roots of all species and were successfully isolated for S. alba and P. tremula. Estimates of average CFU/g of plant tissue per species ranged from 1.5E + 03 to 3.5E + 06, with the lowest figures for P. canescens and the highest for P. tremula together with high number of totally obstructed vessels observed by confocal microscopy. The possibility of insect transmission was also evaluated using an experimental set up based on Mallorca Island. There, transmission by P. spumarius of both X. fastidiosa ST1 and ST81 was proven on S. alba. We thus demonstrated that indigenous European Salicaceae such as S. alba or P. tremula are new potential hosts for X. fastidiosa.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate gaze control mechanisms rely on bilateral mirror-symmetric vestibular endorgans, central circuits, and extraocular motor effectors. Embryonic removal of one inner ear prior to the formation of these structures was used to evaluate the extent to which animals can develop appropriate motor outputs in the presence of only a singular inner ear. Near-congenital one-eared tadpoles subjected to separate or combinatorial visuo-vestibular motion stimulation exhibited vestibular-ocular reflexes, though smaller in gain compared to controls, whereas isolated visuo-motor responses remained largely unaltered. Surprisingly, direction-specific responses in one-eared tadpoles revealed a spectrum of vestibulo-ocular reflex performance, where in many cases rather robust responses were observed during head motion towards the missing ear. Rotation toward the remaining ear elicited eye movements which were often severely attenuated. This suggests that embryonically generated one-eared animals develop bidirectional vestibular signal detection and downstream processing capacities that allow activation of robust compensatory eye movements. However, this capability seems to occur at the expense of performance of vestibular reflexes during motion in the canonical activation direction of the singular ear. Consequently, the development of central vestibulo-motor circuits in one-eared animals likely relies on strategies in which the outcome for gaze stabilization is driven by balanced homeostatic levels and individual temporal tuning of abducens motoneuron activity. Despite the lack of bilateral symmetric vestibular afferent input, the developing central nervous system is capable of creating a framework for symmetric sensorimotor transformations.",

    "abstract": "Recent theories on the neural correlates of face identification stressed the importance of the available identity-specific semantic and affective information. However, whether such information is essential for the emergence of neural signal of familiarity has not yet been studied in detail.\n\nHere, we explored the shared representation of face familiarity between perceptually and personally familiarized identities. We applied a cross-experiment multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA), to test if EEG patterns for passive viewing of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces are useful in decoding familiarity in a matching task where familiarity was attained thorough a short perceptual task. Importantly, no additional semantic, contextual, or affective information was provided for the familiarized identities during perceptual familiarization. Although the two datasets originate from different sets of participants who were engaged in two different tasks, familiarity was still decodable in the sorted, same identity matching trials.\n\nThis finding indicates that the visual processing of the faces of personally familiar and purely perceptually familiarized identities involve similar mechanisms, leading to cross-classifiable neural patterns.",

    "abstract": "Divisive normalization, a prominent descriptive model of neural activity, is employed by theories of neural coding across many different brain areas. Yet, the relationship between normalization and the statistics of neural responses beyond single neurons remains largely unexplored. Here we focus on noise correlations, a widely studied pairwise statistic, because its stimulus and state dependence plays a central role in neural coding. Existing models of covariability typically ignore normalization despite empirical evidence suggesting it affects correlation structure in neural populations. We therefore propose a pairwise stochastic divisive normalization model that accounts for the effects of normalization and other factors on covariability. We first show that normalization modulates noise correlations in qualitatively different ways depending on whether normalization is shared between neurons, and we discuss how to infer when normalization signals are shared. We then apply our model to calcium imaging data from mouse primary visual cortex (V1), and find that it accurately fits the data, often outperforming a popular alternative model of correlations. Our analysis indicates that normalization signals are often shared between V1 neurons in this dataset. Our model will enable quantifying the relation between normalization and covariability in a broad range of neural systems, which could provide new constraints on circuit mechanisms of normalization and their role in information transmission and representation.\n\nAuthor SummaryCortical responses are often variable across identical experimental conditions, and this variability is shared between neurons (noise correlations). These noise correlations have been studied extensively to understand how they impact neural coding and what mechanisms determine their properties. Here we show how correlations relate to divisive normalization, a mathematical operation widely adopted to describe how the activity of a neuron is modulated by other neurons via divisive gain control. We introduce the first statistical model of this relation. We extensively validate the model and investigate parameter inference in synthetic data. We find that our model, when applied to data from mouse visual cortex, outperforms a popular model of noise correlations that does not include normalization, and it reveals diverse influences of normalization on correlations. Our work demonstrates a framework to measure the relation between noise correlations and the parameters of the normalization model, which could become an indispensable tool for quantitative investigations of noise correlations in the wide range of neural systems that exhibit normalization.",

    "abstract": "The human gaze is directed at various locations from moment to moment in acquiring information necessary to recognize the external environment at the fine resolution of foveal vision. Previous studies showed that the human gaze is biased to particular locations in the visual field at a particular timing, but it remains unclear what visual features produce such spatiotemporal bias. In this study, we used a deep convolutional neural network model to extract hierarchical visual features from natural scene images and evaluated how much the human gaze is attracted to the visual features in space and time. Eye movement measurement and visual feature analysis using the deep convolutional neural network model showed that the gaze was strongly attracted to spatial locations containing higher-order visual features than lower-order visual features and conventional saliency. Analysis of the gaze time course revealed that the bias to higher-order visual features was prominent within a short period after the beginning of observation of the natural scene images. These results demonstrate that higher-order visual features are a strong gaze attractor in both space and time, suggesting that the human visual system uses foveal vision resources to extract information from higher-order visual features with higher spatiotemporal priority.",

    "abstract": "Sleep-wake disturbances are among the earliest symptoms of Alzheimers disease (AD) and contribute to disease severity. Since a major driver of AD--the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) in the brain--is modulated by sleep, a \"vicious\" feedforward cycle has been proposed in which A{beta} buildup disrupts sleep, leading to more A{beta} secretion and further worsening of sleep and AD. Consistent with this idea, mouse models of AD develop early sleep phenotypes, and sleep is acutely modulated by exogenous A{beta}. However, these overexpression paradigms leave unclear whether endogenous A{beta} signaling contributes to sleep regulation. To tackle this question, we generated loss of function mutations in the zebrafish orthologs of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and monitored larval sleep behavior. Larvae with mutations in appa had reduced waking activity levels but normal sleep patterns, while larvae that lacked appb had reduced sleep due to an inability to maintain sleep bout durations. In addition, larvae exposed to the {gamma}-secretase inhibitor DAPT, which inhibits A{beta} production from APP, also have shorter sleep bouts at night. Although {gamma}- secretase inhibition impacts the proteolytic cleavage of many proteins, appb mutants were insensitive to the sleep bout shortening effects of DAPT, suggesting that loss of {gamma}-secretase dependent proteolytic cleavage products of Appb are responsible for the reduced sleep maintenance phenotypes. These results are consistent with a model in which endogenous A{beta} directly modulates sleep in zebrafish and supports the idea that sleep disturbances may be a useful early-onset biomarker for AD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the expression of genes impacts plant development and physiology is important for rationally engineering crop improvements. Programmable Transcription Activators (PTAs), including CRISPRa activators, have traditionally relied on a limited number of transcription activation domains, namely the VP64 domain derived from human herpes simplex virus, to control gene expression. We reasoned there was considerable space for PTA improvement by replacing this domain with a plant-derived activation domain. To address this, we designed, built, and tested a PTA library of 38 putative plant transcription activation domains. Domains from HSFA6b, AvrXa10, DOF1, DREB1, and DREB2 genes function as strong activators in Setaria viridis and Arabidopsis thaliana both in protoplast assays and in transgenic plants. Overexpression of multiple endogenous genes (FT, PAP1, WUS) reached levels similar to the highly expressed housekeeping gene, PP2A, regardless of basal expression level. Further, these domains were effective in different PTA architectures, including the dCas9-SunTag, dCas9-Moontag, and TALE-SunTag systems. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of these improved PTAs to map enhancer regions that promote gene expression in plants. This work showcases the effective and flexible nature of PTAs to activate target genes in plants, providing tools that can be used to improve agronomically relevant traits of interest.",

    "abstract": "Transcript stability is an important determinant of its abundance and, consequently, translation. However, it is unclear the extent to which it is modulated between environmental conditions. We previously hypothesised that recovery-induced transcript destabilisation facilitated a phenomenon of rapid recovery gene down-regulation (RRGD) in Arabidopsis thaliana following stress, based on mathematical calculations to account for ongoing transcription. Here, we test this hypothesis, and investigate processes regulating transcript abundance and fate, by quantifying changes in transcription, stability, and translation before, during, and after light stress. We adapt syringe infiltration to apply a transcriptional inhibitor to soil-grown plants in combination with stress. Compared to measurements in juvenile plants and cell culture, we find reduced stability in a range of transcripts. We also observe transcript destabilisation during light stress, followed by stabilisation upon recovery. Alongside fast transcriptional shut-off in recovery, this destabilisation appears to facilitate RRGD. Translation was dynamic over the course of light stress and recovery, with substantial transcript-specific increases in ribosome-association, independent of changes in total transcript abundance, observed after 30 minutes of light stress. Taken together, we provide evidence for the combinatorial regulation of transcription, stability, and translation that occurs to facilitate responses to light stress and recovery.",

Here, we demonstrate the extent and predictability of protein-level variation using diverse arrangements of twelve genes to generate 88 synthetic operons with up to seven genes at varying inducer concentrations. The resulting 2772 protein expression measurements allowed the training of a sequence-based machine learning model that explains 83% of the variation in the data with a mean absolute error of 9% relative to reference constructs, making it a useful tool for protein expression prediction.

    "abstract": "The brain has the extraordinary capacity to construct predictive models of the environment by internalizing statistical regularities in the sensory inputs. The resulting sensory expectations shape how we perceive and react to the world; at the neural level, this relates to decreased neural responses to expected than unexpected stimuli ( expectation suppression). Crucially, expectations may need revision as context changes. However, existing research has often neglected this issue. Further, it is unclear whether contextual revisions apply selectively to expectations relevant to the task at hand, hence serving adaptive behaviour. The present fMRI study examined how contextual visual expectations spread throughout the cortical hierarchy as participants update their beliefs. We created a volatile environment with two state spaces presented over separate contexts and controlled by an independent contextualizing signal. Participants attended a training session before scanning to learn contextual temporal associations among pairs of object images. The fMRI experiment then tested for the emergence of contextual expectation suppression in two separate tasks, respectively with task-relevant and task-irrelevant expectations. Behavioural and neural effects of contextual expectation emerged progressively across the cortical hierarchy as participants attuned themselves to the context: expectation suppression appeared first in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex, followed by the ventral visual stream, up to early visual cortex. This applied selectively to task-relevant expectations. Taken together, the present results suggest that an insular and frontoparietal executive control network may guide the flexible deployment of contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behaviour in our complex and dynamic world.\n\nSignificance statementThe world is structured by statistical regularities, which we use to predict the future. This is often accompanied by suppressed neural responses to expected compared with unexpected events ( expectation suppression). Crucially, the world is also highly volatile and context-dependent: expected events may become unexpected when the context changes, thus raising the crucial need for belief updating. However, this issue has generally been neglected. By setting up a volatile environment, we show that expectation suppression emerges first in executive control regions, followed by relevant sensory areas, only when observers use their expectations to optimise behaviour. This provides surprising yet clear evidence on how the brain controls the updating of sensory expectations for adaptive behaviour in our ever-changing world.",

    "abstract": "The effect of a genetic variant on a complex trait may differ between female and male, and in the presence of such genetic effect heterogeneity, sex-stratified analysis is often used. For example, genetic effects are sex-specific for testosterone levels, and sex-stratified analysis of testosterone in literature provided easy-to-interpret, sex-specific effect size estimates. However, from the perspective of association testing power, sex-stratified analysis may not be the best approach. As sex-specific genetic effect implies SNPxSex interaction effect, jointly testing SNP main and SNPxSex interaction effects may be more powerful than sex-stratified analysis or the standard main-effect testing approach. Moreover, since individual data may be unavailable, it is then of interest to study if the interaction analysis can be derived from sex-stratified summary statistics. We considered several different sex-combined methods and evaluated them through extensive simulation studies. We observed that a) the joint SNP main and SNPxSex interaction analysis is most robust to a wide range of genetic models, and b) this joint interaction testing result can be obtained by quadratically combining sex-stratified summary statistics (i.e. squared sum of the sex-stratified summary statistics). We then reanalysed the testosterone levels of the UK Biobank data using sex-combined interaction analysis, which identified 27 new loci that were missed by the sex-stratified approach and the standard sex-combined analysis. Finally, we provide supporting association evidence for nine new loci, uniquely identified by the sex-combined interaction analysis, from earlier association studies of either testosterone level or steroid biosynthesis pathway where testosterone is synthesized. We thus recommend sex-combined interaction analysis, particularly for traits with known sex differences, for most powerful association testing, then followed by sex-stratified analysis for effect size estimation and interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Life on Earth, including for microbes and cold-blooded animals, often occurs in frigid environments. At frigid temperatures, nearly all intracellular processes slow down which is colloquially said to decelerate lifes pace and, potentially, aging. But even for one cell, an outstanding conceptual challenge is rigorously explaining how the slowed-down intracellular processes collectively sustain a cells life and set its pace. Here, by monitoring individual yeast cells for months at near-freezing temperatures, we show how global gene-expression dynamics and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) act together as the primary factors that dictate and constrain the pace at which a budding yeasts life can progresses in frigid environments. We discovered that yeast cells help each other in surviving and dividing at frigid temperatures. By investigating the underlying mechanism, involving glutathione secretion, we discovered that ROS is the primary determinant of yeasts ability to survive and divide at near-freezing temperatures. Observing days-to-months-long cell-cycle progression in individual cells revealed that ROS inhibits S-G2-M (replicative) phase while elongating G1 (growth) phase up to a temperature-dependent threshold duration, beyond which yeast cannot divide and bursts as an unsustainably large cell. We discovered that an interplay between global gene-expression speed and ROS sets the threshold G1-duration by measuring rates of genome-wide transcription and protein synthesis at frigid temperatures and then incorporating them into a mathematical model. The same interplay yields unbeatable \"speed limits\" for cell cycling - shortest and longest allowed doubling times - at each temperature. These results establish quantitative principles for engineering cold-tolerant microbes and reveal how frigid temperatures can fundamentally constrain microbial life and cell cycle at the systems-level.",

Understanding of these mechanisms of infection control requires the basic knowledge of probiotic mediated gut microbial community alterations especially in presence of different prebiotics. The present study has used the ex-vivo microbiota model and Next Generation Sequencing techniques to demonstrate the effect of EcN along with different sugars, namely glucose, galactose and starch, on the human gut microbiome community composition. The microbiome compositional changes have been observed at two different time-points, set one and a half years apart, in fecal slurries obtained from two donors. The study has indicated that the extent of microbiome alterations varies with different carbohydrate prebiotics and EcN probiotic and most of the alterations are broadly dependent upon the existing gut microbial community structure of the donors. The major distinct compositional changes have been found in the conditions where glucose and starch were administered, both with and without EcN, in spite of the inter-donor microbial community variation. Several of these microbiome component variations also remain consistent for both the time-points, including genus like Bacteroides, Prevotella and Lactobacillus. Altogether, the present study has shown the effectiveness of EcN along with glucose and starch towards specific changes of microbial community alterations independent of initial microbial composition. This type of model study can be implemented for hypothesis testing in case of therapeutic and prophylactic use of probiotic and prebiotic combinations.",

DivIVA is a cell division protein involved in determination of cell pole and division site in bacteria. RqkA phosphorylated cognate DivIVA (drDivIVA) at Threonine 19 (T19) residue located in its pole recognition motif. The phospho-mimetic replacement of T19 (T19E) functioned differently than phospho-ablative (T19A) and drDivIVA proteins. T19E-RFP expressing in wild type background showed arrest in dynamics of drDivIVA, and loss of interaction with genome segregation protein. divIVA is shown to be an essential gene in this bacterium. The allelic replacement of divIVA with T19E-RFP was not tolerated unless drDivIVA was expressed episomally while there was no effect of this replacement with T19A-RFP and drDivIVA-RFP. These results suggested that the T19 phosphorylation in drDivIVA by RqkA has affected in vivo functions of DivIVA that would render cell cycle arrest in this bacterium.",

    "abstract": "The majority of emerging infectious diseases are caused by pathogens with zoonotic origin, and most of these emerged from wildlife reservoirs. Bats are diverse, and widely distributed globally, and are the known or hypothesized reservoir of a series of emerging zoonotic viruses. Analyses of bat viromes have been used to identify novel viruses with potential to cause human infection. We characterized the fecal virome of 26 samples collected from six bat species captured during 2015 in Moscow Region. Of these 13/26 (50%) samples were found to be coronavirus positive. We sequenced and assembled the complete genome of a novel MERS-related Betacoronavirus from Pipistrellus nathusii, named MOW-BatCoV strain 15-22. Of P. nathusii 3/6 samples were found to carriers of MOW-BatCoVs. The genome organization of MOW-BatCoV/15-22 was identical to other known MERS-related coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genomes suggests that MOW-BatCoV/15-22 falls into a distinct subclade closely related to human and camel MERS-CoV, and MERS-related CoVs from the bat species Hypsugo savii and Pipistrellus kuhlii (from Italy) and Neoromicia capensis (from South Africa). Unexpectedly, phylogenetic analysis of the novel MOW-BatCoV 15-22 spike genes showed the closest similarity to a bat CoV Neoromicia/5038 and CoVs from Erinaceus europaeus (the European hedgehog), thus MOW-BatCoV could arise as result of recombination between ancestral viruses of bats and hedgehogs. Computer molecular docking analysis of MOW-BatCoV 15-22 Spike glycoprotein binding to DPP4 receptors of different mammal species predicted highest binding interaction with DPP4 of the bat M. brandtii (docking score -320.15) and the European hedgehog, E. europaeus (docking score -294.51). Hedgehogs are widely kept as pets, and are commonly found in areas of human habitation. Our finding of a novel bat-CoV likely able to infect hedgehogs suggests the potential for hedgehogs to act as intermediate hosts for bat-CoVs between bats and humans.",

    "abstract": "Animal African trypanosomosis, caused by blood protozoan parasites transmitted mainly by tsetse flies, represents a major constraint for millions of cattle in sub-Saharan Africa. Exposed cattle include trypanosusceptible indicine breeds, severely affected by the disease, and West African taurine breeds called trypanotolerant owing to their ability to control parasite development, survive and grow in enzootic areas. Until now the genetic basis of trypanotolerance remains unclear. Here, to improve knowledge of the biological processes involved in trypanotolerance versus trypanosusceptibility, we identified bovine genes differentially expressed in five West African cattle breeds during an experimental infection by Trypanosoma congolense and their biological functions. To this end, whole blood genome-wide transcriptome of three trypanotolerant taurine breeds (NDama, Lagune and Baoule), one susceptible zebu (Zebu Fulani) and one African taurine x zebu admixed breed (Borgou) were profiled by RNA sequencing at four time points, one before and three during infection. As expected, infection had a major impact on cattle blood transcriptome regardless of the breed. The functional analysis of differentially expressed genes over time in each breed confirmed an early activation of the innate immune response, followed by an activation of the humoral response and an inhibition of T cell functions at the chronic stage of infection. More importantly, we highlighted overlooked features, such as a strong disturbance in host metabolism and cellular energy production that differentiates trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible breeds. NDama breed showed the earliest regulation of immune response, associated with a strong activation of cellular energy production, also observed in Lagune, and to a lesser extent in Baoule. Susceptible Zebu Fulani breed differed from other breeds by the strongest modification in lipid metabolism regulation. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the biological mechanisms at work during infection, especially concerning the interplay between immunity and metabolism that seems differentially regulated depending on the cattle breeds.",

    "abstract": "Morphological integration and modularity are concepts that refer to the covariation level between the components of a structure. Species of the opossums, genus Didelphis, have been the object of several taxonomic and morphometric analyses but no study has so far analysed mandibular morphological integration and modularity at a species-level. The aim of this work was to check whether the body (corpus mandibulae, mandibular corpus) and the ramus (ramus mandibulae, ascending mandibular ramus) are separate modules in Didelphis pernigra using a two-dimensional geometric morphometric approach. For this purpose, a sample of hemimandibles from 36 D. pernigra (13 males and 23 females) was analysed using 17 landmarks in lateral view. The modularity hypothesis based on different developmental origins was tested, by using the RV coefficient. Later, the integration level was assessed applying a partial least-squares analysis (PLS). The underlying aim was to know whether the traditional division between mandibular body and ramus has a modular basis, as well as the morphological integration level between these two structures. Results reflected that landmarks integration was not uniform throughout the mandible but structured into two distinct modules: ramus and body. Results allow to conclude that allometry plays an important role in shape variation in this species, and that the hypotheses of two-module organization in males cannot be confirmed. Models that accurately represent the biting mechanics will strengthen our understanding of which variables are functionally relevant and how they are relevant to performances, not only masticatories.",

    "abstract": "The annual toll of sepsis is a 33% mortality rate for hospitalized patients with a cost of greater than 60 billion dollars in the U.S. There is a correlation between sepsis mortality rates and time to treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Consequently, antibiotics are prescribed to nearly every patient suspected of bacteremia. However, once determined that broad-spectrum antibiotics are not required, it is unclear how to optimize the de-escalation of the antibiotics. There is an urgent need for methods to distinguish bacteremia from sterile inflammation and to assess antibiotic efficacy. Rho (Rac1 and RhoA) and Ras (Rap1) family GTPases are dynamic nodes of signaling convergence used by immune-activated leukocytes migrating to sites of infection. This study targeted the onset of GTPase activation as a biomarker of infection-induced immune activation in trauma patients. GTP binding assays were performed using a novel GTPase effector trap flow cytometry assay (G-Trap). Here, we demonstrate increased GTP binding to small GTPases (Rac1, Rap1, and RhoA) of resting cells serially exposed to plasma samples from bacteremic trauma patients. Responses to the serial samples showed that GTPase activation was influenced by the concentration of circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, in tandem with synergy or antagonism from the cytokines and the antibiotic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a severe organ dysfunction syndrome caused by a dysregulation of the immune systems response to infection. Unfortunately, most infection-causing pathogens arent routinely detectable in real-time to enable targeted and lifesaving treatment. Thus, clinicians frequently have limited data on which to base treatment decisions. A complete blood count with differential is available within 24 h, and positive culture is only available in ~30% of cases. Furthermore, a blood culture, the traditional gold standard for accurate diagnosis of bacteremia, may take up to five days for results, long after a clinical decision for sepsis management is required. Circulating leukocytes can sense chemotactic signals released by bloodborne pathogens or focal infections not in the bloodstream. Our earlier study showed that pathogen and host immune factors released in the bloodstream stimulated GTP binding of Ras homology (Rho) GTPases (guanosine triphosphatase) such as Rac1 in quiescent endothelial and human leukocytes after exposure to blood plasma from infected patients.[1] In this study, we measured Rac1*GTP as a biomarker of immune functionality of peripheral blood monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells extracted from blood samples drawn for diagnostic use in blood culture assays; from 120 non-infected control patients and serial blood test samples from 28 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bloodstream infection. 18 cases presented with Rac1*GTP elevation of [&ge;]3 fold above that of control samples. Ten patients with normal or below-normal GTPase activity, accompanied by neutrophilia or pancytopenia.

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs), the key antigen-presenting cells, are primary regulators of immune responses. Transcriptional regulation of DC development had been one of the major research interests in DC biology, however, the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms during DC development remains unclear. Here, we report that Histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3), an important epigenetic regulator, is highly expressed in pDCs, and its deficiency profoundly impaired the development of pDCs. Significant disturbance of homeostasis of hematopoietic progenitors was also observed in HDAC3-deficient mice, manifested by altered cell numbers of these progenitors and defective differentiation potentials for pDCs. Using the in vitro Flt3L supplemented DC culture system, we further demonstrated that HDAC3 was required for the differentiation of pDCs from progenitors at all developmental stages. Mechanistically, HDAC3 deficiency resulted in enhanced expression of cDC1-associated genes, owing to markedly elevated H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at these gene sites in BM pDCs. In contrast, the expression of pDC-associated genes was significantly downregulated, leading to defective pDC differentiation.\n\nSummaryThis work reveals for the first time that HDAC3 is required for the development of pDCs and maintenance of homeostasis of hematopoietic progenitors with DC differentiation potential. Mechanistically, HDAC3 promotes pDC development by repressing the expression of cDC1 associated genes in a deacetylase dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as Rituximab, Ofatumumab and Obinutuzumab are widely used to treat lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. They act by depleting B cells, mainly through Fc-dependent effectors functions. Some patients develop resistance to treatment but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify genes regulating the efficacy of anti-CD20 antibodies. We used as a model the killing of RAJI B cells by Rituximab through complement-dependent-cytotoxicity (CDC). As expected, the screen identified MS4A1, encoding CD20, the target of Rituximab. Among other identified genes, the role of Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) was validated in two B-cell lines. IRF8 knockout also decreased the efficacy of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis (ADCC and ADCP) induced by anti-CD20 antibodies. We further show that IRF8 is necessary for efficient CD20 transcription. Levels of IRF8 and CD20 RNA or proteins correlated in normal B cells and in hundreds of malignant B cells. Therefore, IRF8 regulates CD20 expression and controls the depleting-capacity of anti-CD20 antibodies.

    "abstract": "Reassortment, or genome segment exchange, increases diversity among viruses with segmented genomes. Previous studies on the limitations of reassortment have largely focused on parental incompatibilities that restrict generation of viable progeny. However, less is known about whether factors intrinsic to virus replication influence reassortment. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) encapsidates a segmented, double- stranded RNA genome, replicates within cytoplasmic factories, and is susceptible to host antiviral responses. We sought to elucidate the influence of infection multiplicity, timing, and compartmentalized replication on reovirus reassortment in the absence of parental incompatibilities. We used an established post-PCR genotyping method to quantify reassortment frequency between wild-type and genetically-barcoded type 3 reoviruses. Consistent with published findings, we found that reassortment increased with infection multiplicity until reaching a peak of efficient genome segment exchange during simultaneous coinfection. However, reassortment frequency exhibited a substantial decease with increasing time to superinfection, which strongly correlated with viral transcript abundance. We hypothesized that physical sequestration of viral transcripts within distinct virus factories or superinfection exclusion also could influence reassortment frequency during superinfection. Imaging revealed that transcripts from both wild-type and barcoded viruses frequently co-occupied factories with superinfection time delays up to 16 hours. Additionally, primary infection dampened superinfecting virus transcription with a 24 hour, but not shorter, time delay to superinfection. Thus, in the absence of parental incompatibilities and with short times to superinfection, reovirus reassortment proceeds efficiently and is largely unaffected by compartmentalization of replication and superinfection exclusion. However, reassortment may be limited by superinfection exclusion with greater time delays to superinfection.\n\nIMPORTANCEReassortment, or genome segment exchange between viruses, can generate novel virus genotypes and pandemic virus strains. For viruses to reassort their genome segments, they must replicate within the same physical space by coinfecting the same host cell. Even after entry into the host cell, many viruses with segmented genomes synthesize new virus transcripts and assemble and package their genomes within cytoplasmic replication compartments. Additionally, some viruses can interfere with subsequent infection of the same host or cell. However, spatial and temporal influences on reassortment are only beginning to be explored. We found that infection multiplicity and transcript abundance are important drivers of reassortment during coinfection and superinfection, respectively, for reovirus, which has a segmented, double-stranded RNA genome. We also provide evidence that compartmentalization of transcription and packaging is unlikely to influence reassortment, but the length of time between primary and subsequent reovirus infection can alter reassortment frequency.",

Here, we demonstrate that IgM antibodies, but not IgG or IgA, facilitate parasite genetic hybridization in vitro and in vivo. IgM induces the gradual and transient formation of a structured parasite clump in a process essential for L. major and L. tropica hybridization in vitro. Parasite hybrids and 3-nucleated parasites were observed inside this structure, named the Leishmania mating clump. IgM was also required for or significantly increased Leishmania hybrid formation in vivo. At minimum, we observed a 12-fold increase in the proportion of hybrids recovered from sand flies provided a second blood meal containing IgM compared to controls. Notably, genetic backcross events in sand flies were only observed in the presence of IgM, and were reproducibly recovered, reinforcing the relevance of IgM for Leishmania genetic exchange in vivo. The in vitro and in vivo Leishmania crosses from these studies resulted in full genome hybrids. Leishmania co-option of a host antibody to facilitate mating in the insect vector establishes a new paradigm of parasite-host-vector coevolution that promotes parasite diversity and fitness through genetic exchange.",

Typhoid fever is prevalent in developing countries where diets can be less well-balanced. Here, using a murine model, we investigated the role of the macronutrient composition of the diet in maternal vaccination efficacies of two subunit vaccines targeting typhoid toxin: ToxoidVac and PltBVac. We found that maternal vaccinations protected all offspring against a lethal-dose typhoid toxin challenge in a balanced, normal diet (ND) condition, but the declined protection in a malnourished diet (MD) condition was observed in the PltBVac group. Despite the comparable antibody titers in both MD and ND mothers, MD offspring had a significantly lower level of typhoid toxin neutralizing antibodies than their ND counterparts. We observed a lower expression of the neonatal Fc receptor on the yolk sac of MD mothers than in ND mothers, agreeing with the observed lower antibody titers in MD offspring. Protein supplementation to MD diets, but not fat supplementation, increased FcRn expression and protected all MD offspring from the toxin challenge. Similarly, providing additional typhoid toxin-neutralizing antibodies to MD offspring was sufficient to protect all MD offspring from the toxin challenge. These results emphasize the significance of balanced/normal diets for a more effective maternal vaccination transfer to their offspring.\n\nAuthor summaryTyphoid fever is a life-threatening systemic infectious disease caused by Salmonella Typhi, which is prevalent in developing countries where diets can be less well-balanced. Here, we used mice to study the role of nutrition in maternal vaccination efficacies of two subunit vaccines targeting Salmonellas typhoid toxin. We found maternal vaccinations protected all offspring from a lethal-dose typhoid toxin challenge in a balanced/normal diet (ND) condition, but the lack of protection in a malnourished diet (MD) condition was observed in the PltBVac group. Our data indicate that the difference in maternal vaccination outcomes between ND and MD offspring was due to the less effective maternal antibody transfer from MD mothers to their offspring. Providing additional proteins to MD mothers or additional toxin-neutralizing antibodies to MD offspring saved all malnourished offspring from a lethal-dose typhoid toxin challenge, highlighting the importance of balanced/normal diets for effective maternal vaccination outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium culmorum is a major pathogen of grain crops. Infected plants accumulate deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON), or nivalenol (NIV), which are mycotox-ins of the trichothecene B group. These toxins are also produced by F. graminearum species complex. New trichothecenes structurally similar to trichothecenes B but lacking the carbonyl group on C-8, designated NX toxins, were recently discovered in atypical isolates of F. graminearum from North America. Only these isolates and a few strains of a yet to be characterized Fusarium species from South Africa are known to produce NX-2 and other NX toxins. Here we report that among 20 F. culmorum strains isolated from maize, wheat, and oat in Europe and Asia over a period of 70 years, 18 strains produced NX-2 simultaneously with 3-ADON and DON or NIV. Rice cultures of strains producing 3-ADON accumulated NX-2 in amounts corresponding to 2-8% of 3-ADON (1.2 - 36 mg/kg). A strain producing NIV accumulated NX-2 and NIV at comparable amounts (13.6 and 10.3 mg/kg, respectively). In F. graminearum, producers of NX-2 possess a special variant of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase encoded by TRI1 that is unable to oxidize C-8. In F. culmorum, producers and non-producers of NX-2 possess identical TRI1; the reason for the production of NX-2 is unknown. Our results indicate that production of NX-2 simultaneously with trichothecenes B is a common feature of F. culmorum.\n\nKey resultIsolates of Fusarium culmorum obtained from different hosts at different locations over several dec-ades produced NX-2, which is a type A trichothecene structurally related to 3-ADON.",

We leverage 31,428 diverse clinical isolates to identify genomic regions including phase-variants under positive selection. Of 87,651 INDEL events that emerge repeatedly across the phylogeny, 12.4% are phase-variants within HTs (0.02% of the genome by length). We estimated the in-vitro frameshift rate in a neutral HT at 100x the neutral substitution rate at 1.1 x 10-5 frameshifts/HT/year. Using neutral evolution simulations, we identified 4,098 substitutions and 45 phase-variants to be putatively adaptive to MTBC (P<0.002). We experimentally confirm that a putatively adaptive phase-variant alters the expression of espA, a critical mediator of ESX-1 dependent virulence. Our evidence supports a new hypothesis that phase variation in the ESX-1 system of MTBC can act as a toggle between antigenicity and survival in the host.",

    "abstract": "Pore-forming proteins (PFPs) comprise the largest single class of bacterial protein virulence factors and are expressed by many human and animal bacterial pathogens. Cells that are attacked by these virulence factors activate epithelial intrinsic cellular defenses (or INCEDs) to prevent the attendant cellular damage, cellular dysfunction, osmotic lysis, and organismal death. Several conserved PFP INCEDs have been identified using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the nematicidal PFP Cry5B, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Here we demonstrate that the gene nck-1, which has homologs from Drosophila to humans and links cell signaling with localized F-actin polymerization, is required for INCED against small-pore PFPs in C. elegans. Reduction/loss of nck-1 function results in C. elegans hypersensitivity to PFP attack, a hallmark of a gene required for INCEDs against PFPs. This requirement for nck-1-mediated INCED functions cell-autonomously in the intestine and is specific to PFPs but not other tested stresses. Genetic interaction experiments indicate that nck-1-mediated INCED against PFP attack is independent of the major MAPK PFP INCED pathways. Proteomics and cell biological and genetic studies further indicate that nck-1 functions with F-actin cytoskeleton modifying genes like arp2/3, erm-1, and dbn-1 and that nck-1/arp2/3 promote pore repair at the membrane surface and protect against PFP attack independent of p38 MAPK. Consistent with these findings, PFP attack causes significant changes in the amount of actin cytoskeletal proteins and in total amounts of F-actin in the target tissue, the intestine. nck-1 mutant animals appear to have lower F-actin levels than wild-type C. elegans. Studies on nck-1 and other F-actin regulating proteins have uncovered a new and important role of this pathway and the actin cytoskeleton in PFP INCED and protecting an intestinal epithelium in vivo against PFP attack.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe mechanism of action for a significant number of bacterial protein toxins is the formation of pores in the membrane of target cells. Host cells contain programmed defenses against such attacks. Here we use the model system of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and crystal proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis to demonstrate a new defense pathway mediated by the activity of the NCK-1 protein. Consistent with its known function in mammalian cells, the NCK-1-mediated defense involves various actin-interacting proteins and affects the kinetics of pore repair. This pathway is novel in its independence from MAPK signaling. Furthermore, the NCK-1 activity is found to be generally needed for defense against multiple pore-forming proteins and yet is specific to defense against such proteins but not against other environmental stressors.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, linear motor proteins govern intracellular transport and organization. In bacteria, where linear motors are absent, the ParA/MinD (A/D) family of ATPases spatially organize an array of genetic- and protein-based cellular cargos. ParA is well known to segregate plasmids and chromosomes, as is MinD for its role in divisome positioning. Less studied is the growing list of ParA/MinD-like ATPases found across prokaryotes and involved in the spatial organization of diverse protein-based organelles, such as Bacterial Microcompartments (BMCs), flagella, chemotaxis clusters, and conjugation machinery. Given the fundamental nature of these processes in both cell survival and pathogenesis, the positioning of these cargos has been independently investigated to varying degrees in several organisms. However, it remains unknown whether multiple A/D ATPases can coexist and coordinate the positioning of such a diverse set of fundamental cargos in the same cell. If so, what are the mechanistic commonalities, variation, and specificity determinants that govern the positioning reaction for each cargo? Here, we find that over a third of sequenced bacteria encode multiple A/D ATPases. Among these bacteria, we identified several human pathogens as well as the experimentally tractable organism, Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, which encodes seven A/D ATPases. We directly demonstrate that five of these A/D ATPases are each dedicated to the spatial regulation of a single cellular cargo: the chromosome, the divisome, the carboxysome BMC, the flagellum, and the chemotaxis cluster. We identify putative specificity determinants that allow each A/D ATPase to position its respective cargo. Finally, we show how the deletion of one A/D ATPase can have indirect effects on the inheritance of a cargo actively positioned by another A/D ATPase, stressing the importance of understanding how organelle trafficking, chromosome segregation, and cell division are coordinated in bacterial cells. Together, our data show how multiple A/D ATPases coexist and function to position a diverse set of fundamental cargos in the same bacterial cell. With this knowledge, we anticipate the design of minimal autonomous positioning systems for natural- and synthetic-cargos in bacteria for synthetic biology and biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported transposon mutagenesis as a significant driver of spontaneous mutations in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deneoformans during murine infection. Mutations caused by transposable element (TE) insertion into reporter genes were dramatically elevated at high temperature (37{degrees} versus 30{degrees}) in vitro, suggesting that heat stress stimulates TE mobility in the Cryptococcus genome. To explore the genome-wide impact of TE mobilization, we generated transposon accumulation lines by in vitro passage of C. deneoformans strain XL280 for multiple generations at both 30{degrees} and at the host-relevant temperature of 37{degrees}. Utilizing whole-genome sequencing, we identified native TE copies and mapped multiple de novo TE insertions in these lines. Movements of the T1 DNA transposon occurred at both temperatures with a strong bias for insertion between gene-coding regions. By contrast, the Tcn12 retrotransposon integrated primarily within genes and movement occurred exclusively at 37{degrees}. In addition, we observed a dramatic amplification in copy number of the Cnl1 (C. neoformans LINE-1) retrotransposon in sub-telomeric regions under heat-stress conditions. Comparing TE mutations to other sequence variations detected in passaged lines, the increase in genomic changes at elevated temperature was primarily due to mobilization of the retroelements Tcn12 and Cnl1. Finally, we found multiple TE movements (T1, Tcn12 and Cnl1) in the genomes of single C. deneoformans isolates recovered from infected mice, providing evidence that mobile elements are likely to facilitate microevolution and rapid adaptation during infection.\n\nSignificance StatementRising global temperatures and climate change are predicted to increase fungal diseases in plants and mammals. However, the impact of heat stress on genetic changes in environmental fungi is largely unexplored. Environmental stressors can stimulate the movement of mobile DNA elements (transposons) within the genome to alter the genetic landscape. This report provides a genome-wide assessment of heat stress-induced transposon mobilization in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus. Transposon copies accumulated in genomes more rapidly following growth at the higher, host-relevant temperature. Additionally, movements of multiple elements were detected in the genomes of cryptococci recovered from infected mice. These findings suggest that heat stress-stimulated transposon mobility contributes to rapid adaptive changes in fungi both in the environment and during infection.",

    "abstract": "Scedosporium and Lomentospora are important opportunistic pathogens causing localized or disseminated infection in humans. Understanding their environmental distribution is critical for public hygiene and clinical management. We carried out the first environmental survey in urbanized and natural regions in Taiwan. Overall, Scedosporium and Lomentospora species were recovered in 130 out of 271 soil samples (47.9%) across Taiwan. We morphologically and molecularly identified five Scedosporium species and one Lomentospora species. All four major clinical relevant species were isolated with high frequency, i.e. S. apiospermum (42.5%), S. boydii (27.5%), L. prolificans (15.0%), and S. aurantiacum (8.8%); two clinically minor species, S. dehoogii (5.6%) and S. haikouense (0.6%), had moderate incidence. These fungal species have high incidence in urban (48%) and hospital (67.4%) soil samples, and have limited distribution in samples from natural regions (5%). Multivariate analysis of the fungal composition revealed strong evidence of the preferential distribution of these fungi in urban and hospital regions compared to natural sites. In addition, strong evidence suggested that the distribution and abundance of these fungal species are highly heterogeneous in the environment; samples in vicinity often yield varied fungal communities. Our results indicated that these fungal species are prevalent in soil in Taiwan and their occurrences are associated with human activities. Hygiene sensitive places such as hospitals should be particularly aware of the high frequency of the clinical relevant species.",

    "abstract": "Treatable targets that hinder heart failure development following myocardial infarction remain limited. Through an unbiased transcriptional regulation study for ischemic heart disease, we identified the protein disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which has been almost solely characterized in the brain. Here, we show that loss of DISC1 is a major driver of heart disease and ischemic damage. Silencing of DISC1 sensitizes human cardiomyocyte cell lines to hypoxia, whereas DISC1 overexpression is cardioprotective. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that reduced DISC1 protein levels interrupt multiple signaling processes vital for cardiomyocyte survival whereas overexpression of DISC1 enhances pro survival signalling. The present study has implications for understanding scenarios where cardiomyocytes are unable to increase the levels of DISC1 during ischemia, e.g., in individuals with DISC1 genetic defects. Indeed, patients with severe mental illness display 20 years earlier mortality, with IHD as the greatest cause of death. The present study can thus shed light on this long-term enigma in epidemiology. Furthermore, the promising data showing activation of pro survival signalling processes with DISC1 overexpression opens new directions towards potential treatment strategies of patients suffering from ischemic heart disease.",

    "abstract": "The broad-spectrum antiviral pseudobase T705, a fluorinated pyrazinecarboxamide, is incorporated via its triphosphate form into nascent viral RNA by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Since it mimics guanine or adenine it can act as a mutagen, whereas consecutive incorporation leads to chain termination. Here we examine the structural basis for incorporation and stalling for the case of influenza polymerase, using T1106-TP, the nucleotide form of T1105, the de-fluoro analogue of T705. We used a specially designed template that allows single T1106-MP incorporation at a defined site followed by consecutive T1106-MP incorporation and stalling four nucleotides later, as demonstrated by biochemical analysis. A high-resolution cryoEM structure of influenza A/H7N9 polymerase, stalled after transcribing this template, revealed that the entire product-template duplex has backtracked by five nucleotides. Consequently, the singly incorporated T1106-MP resides at the +1 position and forms an unexpected wobble base-pair with a U in the template. The relative stability of the canonical and wobble T1106:U base-pairs in different contexts is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Using a different template and influenza B polymerase we also observe stalling after double incorporation of T1106-MP and structural analysis showed again that backtracking occurs, this time by four nucleotides. These results show that, at least in early elongation, consecutive T1106-MP incorporation into the product destabilises the proximal end of the product-template duplex, promoting irreversible backtracking until a more favourable overall configuration is achieved. These results give new insight into the unusual mechanism of chain termination by pyrazinecarboxamide base analogues.",

The critical role of these proteins in lymphomas and other cancers has motivated a widespread interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive specificity in Bcl-2 family interactions. However, the substantial structural similarity amongst Bcl-2 homologues has made it difficult to rationalize the highly specific (and often divergent) binding behavior exhibited by these proteins using conventional structural arguments. In this work, we use millisecond hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to explore shifts in conformational dynamics associated with binding partner engagement in Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Using this approach, we reveal that, specifically for Mcl-1, binding specificity arises largely from protein-specific dynamic modes that are accessed in the unbound state. This work has implications for exploring the evolution of internally regulated biological systems composed of structurally similar proteins, and for the development of drugs targeting Bcl-2 family proteins for promotion of apoptosis in cancer.\n\nGeneral Interest StatementThis work reveals how a group of proteins, which are highly similar in structure, can form a complex web of highly specific protein-protein interactions that drive programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer.",

We examined the interstitial Pdgfrb mutant kidney which exhibits a similar mesangial cell defect and found that the Pdgfrb mutant kidney showed normal proximal tubule development, suggesting that the absence of mesangial cells was not the cause of defective proximal tubule development. Our single cell RNA-seq analysis of the interstitial Rbpj mutant kidney showed that a subset of proximal tubule genes were downregulated in the mutant kidney and that Gata3 was downregulated in the mutant interstitium during the development of Ren1-expressing cells. We found that deleting Gata3 in the interstitium caused the loss of Renin and the developmental arrest of proximal tubules, phenocopying the interstitial Notch/Rbpj mutants.

The Rho kinase (ROCK) serine/threonine protein kinases that act downstream of the RhoA small GTP-binding protein regulate nonmuscle myosin contractile force generation. To investigate the role of actomyosin contractility in cardiomyocyte maturation and cell cycle arrest, we conditionally-activated ROCK2 kinase domain (ROCK2:ER) in the murine postnatal heart. Here we show that cardiac-specific activation of actomyosin contractility shifts the balance from cell-cell to cell-matrix adhesions. Specifically, 5/{beta}1 integrin and fibronectin matrix increase in response to actomyosin-mediated tension. Moreover, activation of ROCK2:ER promotes nuclear translocation of Yap, a mechanosensitive transcriptional co-activator, and enhances cardiomyocyte proliferation. Finally, we show that reduction of myocardial 5 integrin rescues the myocardial proliferation phenotype in ROCK2:ER hearts. These data demonstrate that cardiomyocytes respond to increase intracellular tension by altering their intercellular contacts in favor of cell-matrix interactions leading to Yap nuclear translocation, thus uncovering a novel function for nonmuscle myosin contractility in promoting cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in the postnatal heart.",

    "abstract": "Pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) are naturally occurring DNA binding compounds that possess anti-tumor and anti-bacterial activity. Chemical modifications of PBDs can result in improved DNA binding, sequence specificity and enhanced efficacy. More recently, synthetic PBD monomers have shown promise as payloads for antibody drug conjugates and antibacterial agents. The precise mechanism of action of these PBD monomers and their role in causing DNA damage remains to be elucidated. Here we characterized the damage-inducing potential of two C8-linked PBD bi-aryl monomers in Caulobacter crescentus and investigated the strategies employed by cells to repair the same. We show that these compounds cause DNA damage and efficiently kill bacteria, in a manner comparable to the extensively used DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin-C (MMC). However, in stark contrast to MMC which employs a mutagenic lesion tolerance pathway, we implicate essential functions for error-free mechanisms in repairing PBD monomer-mediated damage. We find that survival is severely compromised in cells lacking nucleotide excision repair and to a lesser extent, in cells with impaired recombination-based repair. Loss of nucleotide excision repair leads to significant increase in double-strand breaks, underscoring the critical role of this pathway in mediating repair of PBD-induced DNA lesions. Together, our study provides comprehensive insights into how mono-alkylating DNA-targeting therapeutic compounds like PBD monomers challenge cell growth, and identifies the specific mechanisms employed by the cell to counter the same.",

    "abstract": "PAS-LuxR transcriptional regulators are highly conserved enzymes governing polyene macrolide antifungal biosynthesis. PteF is one of such regulators, situated in the polyene macrolide filipin gene cluster from Streptomyces avermitilis. Its mutation leads to a drastic filipin production decline, but also to a severe loss of oligomycin production, an ATP-synthase inhibitor of macrolide structure, and a delay in sporulation, thus it has been considered as a transcriptional activator. Transcriptomic analyses were carried out in S. avermitilis {Delta}pteF and its parental strain S. avermitilis NRRL 8165 as control. Both strains were grown in YEME medium without sucrose, and samples were taken in the exponential and stationary growth phases. 257 genes showed altered expression in the PteF-deleted mutant, most of them in the exponential phase of growth. Surprisingly, despite PteF being an activator of filipin biosynthesis, a majority of the genes affected upon mutation showed overexpression thus suggesting a negative modulation of those genes. Genes affected were related to various metabolic processes, including genetic information processing; DNA, energy, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism; morphological differentiation; and transcriptional regulation; among others, but particularly to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Notably, ten secondary metabolite gene clusters out of 38 encoded by the genome, some of them encoding cryptic compounds, showed altered expression profiles in the mutant, suggesting a regulatory role for PteF wider than expected. Transcriptomic results were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These findings provide important clues to understand the intertwined regulatory machinery that modulates antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces.",

    "abstract": "The yeast mitogen activated protein kinase pathways serve as a model system for understanding how network interactions affect the way in which cells coordinate the response to multiple signals. We have quantitatively compared two yeast strain backgrounds YPH499 and {Sigma}1278b (both of which have previously been used to study these pathways) and found several important differences in how they coordinate the interaction between the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) and mating pathways. In the {Sigma}1278b background, in response to simultaneous stimulus, mating pathway activation is dampened and delayed in a dose dependent manner. In the YPH499 background, only dampening is dose dependent. Further, leakage from the HOG pathway into the mating pathway (crosstalk) occurs during osmostress alone in the {Sigma}1278b background only. The mitogen activated protein kinase Hog1p suppresses crosstalk late in an induction time course in both strains but does not affect the early crosstalk seen in the {Sigma}1278b background. Finally, the kinase Rck2p plays a greater role suppressing late crosstalk in the {Sigma}1278b background than in the YPH499 background. Our results demonstrate that comparisons between laboratory yeast strains provide an important resource for understanding how signaling network interactions are tuned by genetic variation without significant alteration to network structure.",

    "abstract": "DNA base damage is a major source of oncogenic mutations1. Such damage can produce strand-phased mutation patterns and multiallelic variation through the process of lesion segregation2. Here, we exploited these properties to reveal how strand-asymmetric processes, such as replication and transcription, shape DNA damage and repair. Despite distinct mechanisms of leading and lagging strand replication3,4, we observe identical fidelity and damage tolerance for both strands. For small DNA adducts, our results support a model in which the same translesion polymerase is recruited on-the-fly to both replication strands, starkly contrasting the strand asymmetric tolerance of bulky adducts5. We find that DNA damage tolerance is also common during transcription, where RNA-polymerases frequently bypass lesions without triggering repair. At multiple genomic scales, we show the pattern of DNA damage induced mutations is largely shaped by the influence of DNA accessibility on repair efficiency, rather than gradients of DNA damage. Finally, we reveal specific genomic conditions that can corrupt the fidelity of nucleotide excision repair and actively drive oncogenic mutagenesis. These results provide insight into how strand-asymmetric mechanisms underlie the formation, tolerance, and repair of DNA damage, thereby shaping cancer genome evolution.",

The transmembrane glycoprotein CD44 is upregulated in certain cancers and CD44 cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) regulates cellular migration. Here we provide evidence that mature ADAM10 is expressed in NMR primary skin fibroblasts (NPSF), and that ionomycin increases cell surface ADAM10 localization. However, we observed an absence of ADAM10 mediated CD44 cleavage, as well as shedding of exogenous and overexpressed betacellulin in NPSF, whereas in mouse primary skin fibroblasts (MPSF) ionomycin induced ADAM10-dependent cleavage of both CD44 and betacellulin. Overexpressing a hyperactive form of the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scramblase ANO6 in NPSF increased phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, which rescued the ADAM10 sheddase activity and promoted wound closure in NPSF in an ADAM10-dependent manner. These findings suggest that dysregulation of ADAM10 shedding activity is due to a deficient PS externalization in NMR.",

    "abstract": "Successful neuronal regeneration requires the re-establishment of synaptic connectivity. Crucial to this process is the reconstitution of presynaptic machinery responsible for controlling neurotransmitter release. In the mammalian adult CNS post-injury regeneration is usually only possible after extensive experimental intervention, and it is unknown how presynaptic function is re-established, let alone how it might be optimised to promote functional recovery. Here we addressed these questions by studying presynaptic maturation during a regenerative process that occurs entirely naturally. After toxin-induced injury, olfactory sensory neurons in the adult mouse olfactory epithelium can regenerate fully, sending axons to the brain to re-establish synaptic contact with postsynaptic partners in the olfactory bulb. Using electrophysiological recordings in acute slices, we found that after initial re-contact, functional connectivity in this system was rapidly established. Moreover, re-connecting presynaptic terminals had almost mature functional properties, including high release probability and a strong capacity for presynaptic inhibition. Release probability then matured quickly, rendering re-established terminals functionally indistinguishable from controls just one week after initial contact. These data show that successful synaptic regeneration in the adult mammalian brain is not quite a  plug-and-play process; instead, almost-mature presynaptic terminals undergo a rapid phase of functional maturation to re-integrate into established target networks.",

    "abstract": "Craniofacial malformations are present in more than one third of all congenital syndromes, but the pathogenesis of skeletal dysmorphology is poorly understood. Here, using an unbiased forward genetics approach in zebrafish, we identified a mutation in erc1b that leads to craniofacial defects, including micrognathia and hypertelorism caused by impaired cartilage and bone growth. To date, ERC1 has not been considered a candidate gene for craniofacial syndromes. Using live in vivo imaging, genetic depletion and replacement experiments, and transgenic approaches, we interrogated erc1b function. We found that Erc1b regulates extracellular matrix (ECM) trafficking required for the highly conserved \"stack of coins\" organization of chondrocytes in cartilage that is essential for skeletal growth and integrity. Erc1b functions cellautonomously at the chondrocyte cell cortex to regulate traffic of ECM and plasma membrane expansion in a microtubule dependent manner during isometric cell growth. Disruption of Erc1-Rab8-Kinesin-1 axis leads to failure of cartilage maturation, endochondral bone formation and ultimately chondrocyte cell death.

Using quantitative photobleaching, we find that early phagosomes (EPs) and late phagosomes (LPs) are associated with different sets of kinesin-1, -2, -3, and dynein. While EPs exhibit unidirectional retrograde transport, LPs move bidirectionally. Previously, we found that tau biases LP transport towards the microtubule minus-end. Here, we find that tau strongly inhibits long-range retrograde EP motility. Tau impedes the forces generated by multi-dynein teams and accelerates dynein unbinding under load.
