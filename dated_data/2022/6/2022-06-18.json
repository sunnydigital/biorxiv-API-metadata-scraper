    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSperm is the most fundamental male reproductive feature. It serves the fertilization of eggs and evolves under sexual selection. Two components of sperm are of particular interest, their number and their morphology. Mode of fertilization is believed to be a key determinant of sperm length across the animal kingdom. External fertilization, unlike internal, favors small and numerous sperm, since sperm density is thinned out in the environment. Here, we study the evolution of sperm morphology in the genus Daphnia, where fertilization occurs in a receptacle, the brood pouch, where sperm can constantly be flushed out by a water current. Based on microscopic observations of sperm morphologies mapped on a phylogeny with 15 Daphnia and 2 outgroup species, we found that despite the internal fertilization mode, Daphnia have among the smallest sperm recorded, as would be expected with external fertilization. Despite being all relatively small compared to other arthropods, sperm length diverged at least twice, once within each of the Daphnia subgenera Ctenodaphnia and Daphnia. Furthermore, species in the latter subgenus also lost the ability of cell compaction by extracellular encapsulation and have very polymorphic sperm with long, and often numerous, filopodia. We discuss the different strategies that Daphnia evolved to achieve fertilization success in the females brood pouch.",

    "abstract": "Environmental and molecular cues early in life are often associated with the permanent shaping of our immune system during adulthood. Although increasing, our knowledge of the signaling pathways that operate in early life and their temporal mode of action is limited. Herein, we demonstrate that the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2), which are E3 ubiquitin ligases and master regulators of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) pathway, function during late neonatal and prepubescent life to sustain interleukin(IL)-17-producing gamma delta T cells ({gamma}{delta}T17) and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). We show that cell-intrinsic deficiency in cIAP1/2 at 3-4 weeks of life leads to downregulation of the transcription factors cMAF and ROR{gamma}t, and failure to enter cytokine-induced cell cycle. This is followed by progressive loss of {gamma}{delta}T17 cells and ILC3 while mice are aging. Mice deficient in cIAP1/2 have severely reduced {gamma}{delta}T17 cells and ILC3, present with suboptimal {gamma}{delta}T17 responses in the skin, lack small intestinal isolated lymphoid follicles and cannot control intestinal bacterial infection. Mechanistically, these effects appear to be dependent on overt activation of the non-canonical NF-{kappa}B pathway. Our data identify the cIAP E3 ubiquitin ligases as critical early life molecular switches for establishing effective type-3 immunity during aging.",

    "abstract": "Territorial animals often respond less aggressively to neighbours than strangers. This  dear enemy effect is hypothesized to be adaptive by reducing unnecessary aggressive interactions with non-threatening individuals. A key prediction of this hypothesis, that individual fitness will be affected by variation in the speed and the extent to which individuals reduce their aggression towards neighbours relative to strangers, has never been tested. We used a series of song playbacks to measure the change in response of male great tits to a simulated establishment of a neighbour on an adjacent territory during early stages of breeding, as an assay of individuals tendencies to form dear enemy relationships. Males reduced their approach to the speaker and sang fewer songs on later playback repetitions. However, only some males exhibited dear enemy behaviour by responding more strongly to a subsequent stranger playback, and when the playback procedure was repeated on a subset of males, there was some indication for consistent differences among individuals in the expression of dear enemy behaviour. We monitored nests and analysed offspring paternity to determine male reproductive success. Individuals that exhibited dear enemy behaviour towards the simulated neighbour did not suffer any costs associated with loss of paternity, but there was also no evidence of reproductive benefits, and no net effect on reproductive fitness. The general ability to discriminate between neighbours and strangers is likely adaptive, but benefits are probably difficult to detect because of the indirect link between individual variation in dear enemy behaviour and reproductive fitness, and because of the complex range of mechanisms affecting relations with territorial neighbours.",

    "abstract": "Streptomycetes are Gram-positive actinobacteria largely represented in the plant root microbiota. The genetic determinants involved in the presence of Streptomyces in the rhizosphere are mostly unknown but can rely on the ability to release phytohormones, degrade plant cell-wall polysaccharides and produce specialised metabolites. Here we sequenced the genome of the rhizospheric and plant defence-stimulating strain Streptomyces sp. AgN23. We found out that it belongs to the soil and plant root dwelling S. violaceusniger clade. The genome annotation of AgN23 revealed the ability of the bacterium to synthesise auxin, a major regulator of plant development, to degrade plant cell wall with a large repertoire of carbohydrate degrading enzymes and to produce antimicrobials (rustmicin, mediomycin, niphimycin, nigericin) and plant bioactive compounds (nigericin, echosides, elaiophylin) through a set of biosynthetic gene clusters. We also found that these genomic features are well-conserved among members of the S. violaceusniger clade. In addition, AgN23 display original events of biosynthetic gene clusters acquisitions and losses which may account for its beneficial effect on plants. Taken together, our work supports the hypothesis that hydrolytic enzymes and specialised metabolites repertoires underpin the interaction of bacteria belonging to the S. violaceusniger clade with plant roots within the rhizosphere.\n\nImpact statementStreptomycetes are filamentous Gram-positive bacteria universally found around and within host plant tissues. These actinobacteria have been extensively investigated for their tremendous ability to produce diverse specialised metabolites (e.g., antibiotics). By contrast their impact on host plant physiology is widely neglected. Whether specific lineage of Streptomyces colonise host plant and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms is poorly documented. Here we report a chromosome-scale assembly of AgN23 genome, a Streptomyces sp. strain previously characterised for its ability to activate the plant immune system. This reference sequence enabled us to position AgN23 in the S. violaceusniger clade from which several representatives have been isolated worldwide from the rhizosphere of unrelated plants. Comparative genomic studies suggest that S. violaceusniger spp. produce a prominent CAZyome with expansion of plant cell wall degrading enzymes families and a conserved specialised metabolism acting on host plant physiology and its rhizospheric microbiota. These genomic features may underly S. violaceusniger spp. adaptation to the rhizopsheric niche.\n\nData summaryThe raw reads sequences of AgN23 genome are available at NCBI on the Sequence Read Archive portal for PacBio and MiSeq data (SRR13990229 and SRR14028548 respectively).

    "abstract": "In BriefMost studies assessing decision-making under uncertainty exploit events with probabilities that are typically above 10%. Here, to study decision-making in radical uncertainty conditions, Degoulet, Willem, Baunez, Luchini and Pintus provide a novel modelling and experimental approach that aims at measuring the extent to which rats are sensitive - and how they respond - to events that are both very rare (probability below 1%) and very extreme in their consequences, in a novel four-armed bandit task. Gains (sugar pellets) and losses (time-out punishments) are such that large - but rare - outcomes materialize or not depending on the option chosen. The results show that all rats diversify their choices mainly across two options, out of four, and that most rats feature sensitivity to rare and extreme events despite their infrequent occurrence. They do so by combining more often options with extreme gains (Jackpots) and/or avoidance of extreme losses (Black Swans). Notably, most rats choices feature one-sided sensitivity in favor of trying more often to avoid extreme losses than to seek extreme gains - that is, they feature the Black Swan Avoidance.\n\nHighlights- Novel modelling and experimental design are proposed to measure the extent to which whether rats are sensitive - and how they respond - to radical uncertainty materialized by events that are both very rare and extreme in their consequences, in a novel four-armed bandit task;\n- Most rats exhibit moderate to high sensitivity to rare and extreme events;\n- Most rats opt more often to avoid rare and extreme losses than to seek rare and extreme gains: they feature the Black Swan avoidance.",

This construction restricts the applicability of the resulting \"Wright-Fisher diffusion equation\" to the weak selection, weak mutation regime of evolution. We argue that diffusion approximations of the Wright-Fisher model can be used more generally, for instance in cases where genetic drift is much weaker than selection. One important example of this regime is Mullers ratchet phenomenon, whereby deleterious mutations slowly but irreversibly accumulate through rare stochastic fluctuations. Using a modified diffusion equation we derive improved analytical estimates for the mean click time of the ratchet.",

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem disorder with neurobehavioral, metabolic, and hormonal phenotypes, caused by loss of expression of a paternally-expressed imprinted gene cluster. Prior evidence from a PWS mouse model identified abnormal pancreatic islet development with retention of aged insulin and deficient insulin secretion. To determine the collective roles of PWS genes in {beta}-cell biology, we used genome-editing to generate isogenic, clonal INS-1 insulinoma lines having 3.16 Mb deletions of the silent, maternal (control) or active, paternal PWS-alleles. PWS {beta}-cells demonstrated a significant cell-autonomous reduction in basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Further, proteomic analyses revealed reduced levels of cellular and secreted hormones, including all insulin peptides and amylin, concomitant with reduction of at least ten endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones, including GRP78 and GRP94. Critically, transcriptomic studies demonstrated that the broad reduction of ER chaperones originated from transcriptional downregulation without corresponding changes for Ins1 and Ins2. In contrast to the dosage compensation previously seen for ER chaperones in Grp78 or Grp94 gene knockouts or knockdown, compensation is precluded by the stress-independent deficiency of ER chaperones in PWS {beta}-cells. Consistent with reduced ER chaperones levels, PWS INS-1 {beta}-cells are more sensitive to ER stress, leading to earlier activation of all three arms of the unfolded protein response. These findings suggest that a chronic shortage of ER chaperones in PWS {beta}-cells leads to a deficiency of protein folding and/or delay in ER transit of insulin and other cargo. In summary, our results illuminate the pathophysiological basis of pancreatic {beta}-cell hormone deficits in PWS, with evolutionary implications for the multigenic PWS-domain, and indicate that PWS-imprinted genes coordinate concerted regulation of ER chaperone biosynthesis and {beta}-cell secretory pathway function.",

    "abstract": "Cohesin folds mammalian interphase chromosomes by extruding the chromatin fiber into numerous loops. \"Loop extrusion\" can be impeded by chromatin-bound factors, such as CTCF, which generates characteristic and functional chromatin organization patterns. It has been proposed that transcription relocalizes or interferes with cohesin, and that active promoters are cohesin loading sites. However, the effects of transcription on cohesin have not been reconciled with observations of active extrusion by cohesin. To determine how transcription modulates extrusion, we studied mouse cells in which we could alter cohesin abundance, dynamics, and localization by genetic  knockouts of the cohesin regulators CTCF and Wapl. Through Hi-C experiments, we discovered intricate, cohesin-dependent contact patterns near active genes. Chromatin organization around active genes exhibited hallmarks of interactions between transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) and extruding cohesins. These observations could be reproduced by polymer simulations in which RNAPs were \"moving barriers\" to extrusion that obstructed, slowed, and pushed cohesins. The simulations predicted that preferential loading of cohesin at promoters is inconsistent with our experimental data. Additional ChIP-seq experiments showed that the putative cohesin loader Nipbl is not predominantly enriched at promoters. Therefore, we propose that cohesin is not preferentially loaded at promoters and that the barrier function of RNAP accounts for cohesin accumulation at active promoters. Altogether, we find that RNAP is a new type of extrusion barrier that is not stationary, but rather, translocates and relocalizes cohesin. Loop extrusion and transcription might interact to dynamically generate and maintain gene interactions with regulatory elements and shape functional genomic organization.\n\nSignificance StatementLoop extrusion by cohesin is critical to folding the mammalian genome into loops. Extrusion can be halted by CTCF proteins bound at specific genomic loci, which generates chromosomal domains and can regulate gene expression. However, the process of transcription itself can modulate cohesin, thus refolding chromosomes near active genes. Through experiments and simulations, we show that transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) act as \"moving barriers\" to loop-extruding cohesins. Unlike stationary CTCF barriers, RNAPs actively relocalize cohesins, which generates characteristic patterns of spatial organization around active genes. Our model predicts that the barrier function of RNAP can explain why cohesin accumulates at active promoters and provides a mechanism for clustering active promoters. Through transcription-extrusion interactions, cells might dynamically regulate functional genomic contacts.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has shaped eukaryote evolution remains an open question. Two recent studies reported four plant-like genes acquired through two HGT events by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a major agricultural pest (Lapadula et al. 2020; Xia et al. 2021). Here, we uncovered a total of 49 plant-like genes deriving from at least 24 independent HGT events in the genome of the MEAM1 whitefly. Orthologs of these genes are present in three cryptic B. tabaci species, they are phylogenetically nested within plant sequences, and expressed and under purifying selection. The predicted functions of these genes suggest that most of them are involved in plant-insect interactions. Thus, substantial plant-to-insect HGT may have facilitated the evolution of B. tabaci towards adaptation to a large host spectrum. Our study shows that eukaryote-to-eukaryote HGT may be relatively common in some lineages and it provides new candidate genes that may be targeted to improve current control strategies against whiteflies.",

    "abstract": "Tandem mass spectrometry is the only high-throughput method for analyzing the protein content of complex biological samples and is thus the primary technology driving the growth of the field of proteomics. A key outstanding challenge in this field involves identifying the sequence of amino acids--the peptide--responsible for generating each observed spectrum, without making use of prior knowledge in the form of a peptide sequence database. Although various machine learning methods have been developed to address this de novo sequencing problem, challenges that arise when modeling tandem mass spectra have led to complex models that combine multiple neural networks and post-processing steps. We propose a simple yet powerful method for de novo peptide sequencing, Casanovo, that uses a transformer framework to map directly from a sequence of observed peaks (a mass spectrum) to a sequence of amino acids (a peptide). Our experiments show that Casanovo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset using a standard cross-species evaluation framework which involves testing with spectra with never-before-seen peptide labels. Casanovo not only achieves superior performance but does so at a fraction of the model complexity and inference time required by other methods.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and HypothesisPreclinical studies have shown that neuromodulation can increase vaginal blood perfusion, but the effect on vulvar blood perfusion is unknown. We hypothesized that pudendal and tibial nerve stimulation could evoke an increase in vulvar blood perfusion.\n\nMethodsWe used female Sprague-Dawley rats for non-survival procedures under urethane anesthesia. We measured perineal blood perfusion in response to twenty-minute periods of pudendal and tibial nerve stimulation using laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI). After a thoracic-level spinalization and a rest period, we repeated each stimulation trial. We calculated average blood perfusion before, during, and after stimulation for three perineal regions (vulva, anus, and inner thigh), for each nerve target and spinal cord condition.\n\nResultsWe observed a significant increase in vulvar, anal, and inner thigh blood perfusion during pudendal nerve stimulation in spinally intact and spinalized rats. Tibial nerve stimulation had no effect on perineal blood perfusion for both spinally intact and spinalized rats.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first study to examine vulvar hemodynamics with LSCI in response to nerve stimulation. This study demonstrates that pudendal nerve stimulation modulates vulvar blood perfusion, indicating the potential of pudendal neuromodulation to improve genital blood flow as a treatment for women with sexual dysfunction. This study provides further support for neuromodulation as a treatment for women with sexual arousal disorders. Studies in unanesthetized animal models with genital arousal disorders are needed to obtain further insights into the mechanisms of neural control over genital hemodynamics.\n\nBrief SummaryIn an anesthetized rodent model, electrical stimulation of the pudendal nerve will drive increases in vulvar blood perfusion while tibial nerve stimulation will not.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage triggers a widely conserved stress response in bacteria called the SOS response that involves two key regulators, the activator RecA and the transcriptional repressor LexA. Despite the wide conservation of the SOS response, the number of genes controlled by LexA varies considerably between different organisms. The filamentous soil-dwelling bacteria of the genus Streptomyces contain LexA and RecA homologs but their roles in Streptomyces have not been systematically studied. Here, we demonstrate that RecA and LexA are required for the survival of Streptomyces venezuelae during DNA damaging conditions and for normal development during unperturbed growth. Monitoring the activity of a fluorescent recA promoter fusion and LexA protein levels revealed that the activation of the SOS response is delayed in S. venezuelae. By combining global transcriptional profiling and ChIP-seq analysis, we determined the LexA regulon and defined the core set of DNA damage repair genes that are expressed in response to treatment with the DNA alkylating agent mitomycin C. Our results show that DNA damage-induced degradation of LexA results in the differential regulation of LexA target genes. Using Surface Plasmon Resonance, we further confirm the LexA DNA binding motif (SOS box) and demonstrate that LexA displays tight but distinct binding affinities to its target promoters, indicating a graded response to DNA damage.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe transcriptional regulator LexA functions as a repressor of the bacterial SOS response, which is induced during DNA damaging conditions. This results in the expression of genes important for survival and adaptation. Here, we report the regulatory network controlled by LexA in the filamentous antibiotic producing Streptomyces bacteria and establish the existence of the SOS response in Streptomyces. Collectively, our work reveals significant insights into the DNA damage response in Streptomyces that will promote further studies to understand how these important bacteria adapt to their environment.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) binding is a key component of genomic regulation. There are numerous high-throughput experimental methods to characterize TF-DNA binding specificities. Their application, however, is both laborious and expensive, which makes profiling all TFs challenging. For instance, the binding preferences of ~25% human TFs remain unknown; they neither have been determined experimentally nor inferred computationally. We introduce a structure-based learning approach to predict the binding preferences of TFs and the automated modelling of TF regulatory complexes. We show the advantage of using our approach over the state-of-art nearest-neighbor prediction in the limits of remote homology. Starting from a TF sequence or structure, we predict binding preferences in the form of motifs that are then used to scan a DNA sequence for occurrences. The best matches are either profiled with a binding score or collected for their subsequent modeling into a higher-order regulatory complex with DNA. Cooperativity is modelled by: i) the co-localization of TFs; and ii) the structural modeling of protein-protein interactions between TFs and with co-factors. As case examples, we apply our approach to automatically model the interferon-{beta} enhanceosome and the pioneering complex of OCT4, SOX2 and SOX11 with a nucleosome, which are compared with the experimentally known structures.",

We aim to develop a method of determining expression patterns of functional channels in terms of the whole-cell ionic conductances (Gx) using individual spontaneous AP configurations. However, it has been suggested that apparently identical AP configurations were obtained by different sets of ionic currents in a mathematical model of cardiac membrane excitation. If so, the inverse problem of Gx estimation might not be solved. We computationally tested the feasibility of the gradient-based optimization method. For realistic examination, conventional  cell-specific models were prepared by superimposing the model output of AP on each experimental AP record by the conventional manual adjustment of Gxs of the baseline model. Then, Gxs of 4 ~ 6 major ionic currents of the  cell-specific models were randomized within a range of {+/-}5 ~ 15% and were used as initial parameter sets for the gradient-based automatic Gxs recovery by decreasing the mean square error (MSE) between the target and model output. When plotted all data points of MSE - Gx relation during the optimization, we found that the randomized population of Gxs progressively converged to the original value of the cell-specific model with decreasing MSE. To confirm the absence of any other local minimum in the global search space, we mapped the MSE by randomizing Gxs over a range of 0.1 ~ 10 times the control. No additional local minimum of MSE was obvious in the whole parameter space besides the global minimum of MSE at the default model parameter.",

    "abstract": "Accurate brain tissue extraction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is crucial for analyzing brain structure and function. While several conventional tools have been optimized to handle human brain data, there have been no generalizable methods to extract brain tissues for multimodal MRI data from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Therefore, developing a flexible and generalizable method for extracting whole brain tissue across species would allow researchers to analyze and compare experiment results more efficiently. Here, we propose a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network, named the Brain Extraction Net (BEN), to extract brain tissues across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. We have evaluated BEN on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4,601 human MRI scans, covering five species, four modalities, and six MR scanners with various magnetic field strengths. Compared to conventional toolboxes, the superiority of BEN is illustrated by its robustness, accuracy, and generalizability. Our proposed method not only provides a generalized solution for extracting brain tissue across species but also significantly improves the accuracy of atlas registration, thereby benefiting the downstream processing tasks. As a novel fully automated deep-learning method, BEN is designed as an open-source software to enable high-throughput processing of neuroimaging data across species in preclinical and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Cell stiffness and T-box transcription factor 3 (TBX3) expression have been identified as biomarkers of melanoma metastasis in 2D environments. This study aimed to determine how mechanical and biochemical properties of melanoma cells change during cluster formation in 3D environments. Vertical growth phase (VGP) and metastatic (MET) melanoma cells were embedded in 3D collagen matrices of 2 and 4 mg/ml collagen concentrations, representing low and high matrix stiffness. Mitochondrial fluctuation, intracellular stiffness, and TBX3 expression were quantified before and during cluster formation. In isolated cells, mitochondrial fluctuation decreased and intracellular stiffness increased with increase in disease stage from VGP to MET and increased matrix stiffness. TBX3 was highly expressed in soft matrices but diminished in stiff matrices for VGP and MET cells. Cluster formation of VGP cells was excessive in soft matrices but limited in stiff matrices, whereas for MET cells it was limited in soft and stiff matrices. In soft matrices, VGP cells did not change the intracellular properties, whereas MET cells exhibited increased mitochondrial fluctuation and decreased TBX3 expression. In stiff matrices, mitochondrial fluctuation and TBX3 expression increased in VGP and MET, and intracellular stiffness increased in VGP but decreased in MET cells. The findings suggest that soft extracellular environments are more favourable for tumour growth, and high TBX3 levels mediate collective cell migration and tumour growth in the earlier VGP disease stage but play a lesser role in the later metastatic stage of melanoma.\n\nSymbols\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=184 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/495509v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1444cf4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@118427eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b56a0aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@144d41f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat is produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the lipid-filled adipocytes into 3D fats using alginate or transglutaminase binders. The 3D fats were visually similar to fat tissue harvested from animals, with matching textures based on uniaxial compression tests. The mechanical properties of cultured fat tissues were based on binder choice and concentration, and changes in the fatty acid compositions of cellular triacylglyceride and phospholipids were observed after lipid supplementation (soybean oil) during in vitro culture. This approach of aggregating individual adipocytes into a bulk 3D tissue provides a scalable and versatile strategy to produce cultured fat tissue for food-related applications, thereby addressing a key obstacle in cultivated meat production.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/495192v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@148ac5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c8f94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@186553aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@458c09_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

It forms a membrane-bound pre-pore complex that converts to a pore-forming structure upon acidification; but its mechanism of conformational transition has been debated. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy, tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine structures of PFN2 in pre-pore and pore conformations in isolation and bound to liposomes. In isolation and upon acidification, the pre-assembled complete pre-pore rings convert to pores in both flat ring and twisted conformations. The twisted pore structure suggests an intermediate or alternative state to the flat conformation, and a capacity to distort the underlying membrane during membrane insertion. On membranes, in situ assembled PFN2 pre-pores display various degrees of completeness; whereas PFN2 pores are mainly incomplete arc structures that follow the same subunit packing arrangements as found in isolation. Both assemblies on membranes use their P2 {beta}-hairpin for binding to the lipid membrane surface. These structural snapshots in different states reveal a molecular mechanism for PFN2 pre-pore to pore transition on a targeted membrane.",

Many studies demonstrate the power of functional connectivity (FC) graph-based biomarkers for automated diagnosis of AD using electroencephalography (EEG). However, various FC measures are commonly utilised, as each aims to quantify a unique aspect of brain coupling. Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful framework for learning on graphs. While a growing number of studies use GNN to classify EEG brain graphs, it is unclear which method should be utilised to estimate the brain graph. We use eight FC measures to estimate FC brain graphs from sensor-level EEG signals. GNN models are trained in order to compare the performance of the selected FC measures. Additionally, three baseline models based on literature are trained for comparison. We show that GNN models perform significantly better than the other baseline models. Moreover, using FC measures to estimate brain graphs improves the performance of GNN compared to models trained using a fixed graph based on the spatial distance between the EEG sensors. However, no FC measure performs consistently better than the other measures. The best GNN reaches 0.984 area under sensitivity-specificity curve (AUC) and 92% accuracy, whereas the best baseline model, a convolutional neural network, has 0.924 AUC and 84.7% accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that are known to infect most types of animals. Many species of microsporidia can infect multiple related hosts, but it is not known if microsporidia express different genes depending upon which host species is infected or if the host response to infection is specific to each microsporidia species. To address these questions, we took advantage of two species of Nematocida microsporidia, N. parisii and N. ausubeli, that infect two species of Caenorhabditis nematodes, C. elegans and C. briggsae. We performed RNA-seq at several time points for each host infected with either microsporidia species. We observed that Nematocida transcription was largely independent of its host. We also observed that the host transcriptional response was similar when infected with either microsporidia species. Finally, we analyzed if the host response to microsporidia infection was conserved across host species. We observed that although many of the genes upregulated in response to infection are not direct orthologs, the same expanded gene families are upregulated in both Caenorhabditis hosts. Together our results describe the transcriptional interactions of Nematocida infection in Caenorhabditis hosts and demonstrate that these responses are evolutionarily conserved.\n\nSignificance statementMicrosporidia are a powerful model to study pathogen evolution, but much is still unknown about how these pathogens have evolved to infect multiple host species. We found that microsporidia express most of their genes similarly even when they are infecting different host species and that related host species respond similarly to different microsporidia. Our results suggests that there are conserved transcriptional responses during microsporidia infection.",

    "abstract": "The proper regulation of muscle stem cell (MuSC) fate by cues from the niche is essential for regeneration of skeletal muscle. How pro-regenerative niche factors control the dynamics of MuSC fate decisions remains unknown due to limitations of population-level endpoint assays. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a novel binary dynamic fluorescence time lapse imaging analysis (BDFA) approach that leverages machine learning classification strategies to track single cell fate decisions with high temporal resolution. Using two fluorescent reporters that read out maintenance of stemness and myogenic commitment, we constructed detailed lineage trees for individual MuSCs and their progeny, classifying each division event as symmetric self-renewing, asymmetric, or symmetric committed. Our analysis reveals that treatment with the lipid metabolite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), accelerates the rate of MuSC proliferation over time, while biasing division events toward symmetric self-renewal. In contrast, the IL6 family member, Oncostatin M (OSM) decreases the proliferation rate after the first generation, while blocking myogenic commitment. These insights into the dynamics of MuSC regulation by niche cues were uniquely enabled by our BDFA approach. We anticipate that similar binary live cell readouts derived from BDFA will markedly expand our understanding of how niche factors control tissue regeneration in real time.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) controls the internalization and function of a wide range of cell surface proteins. CME occurs by the assembly of clathrin and many other proteins on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane into clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). These structures recruit specific membrane protein cargo destined for internalization and trigger the generation of membrane curvature that precedes eventual scission of CCPs from the plasma membrane to yield intracellular vesicles. The diversity of cell surface protein cargo thus controlled by CME indicates that CCP formation is regulated to allow cellular adaptation under different contexts. Of interest is how cues derived from cellular metabolism may regulate CME, given the reciprocal role of CME in controlling cellular metabolism. The modification of proteins with O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is sensitive to nutrient availability and may allow cellular adaptation to different metabolic conditions. We examined how the modification of proteins with O-GlcNAc may control CCP formation and thus CME. We used perturbation of key enzymes responsible for protein O-GlcNAc modification, as well as specific mutants of the endocytic regulator AAK1 predicted to be impaired for O-GlcNAc modification. We identify that CCP initiation and the assembly of clathrin and other proteins within CCPs is controlled by O-GlcNAc protein modification. This reveals a new dimension of regulation of CME and highlights the important reciprocal regulation of cellular metabolism and endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Precise genome engineering is essential for both basic and applied research. CRISPR/Cas accelerated the speed and ease by which defined exogenous sequences are integrated into specific loci. Nevertheless, knock-in generation in multicellular animals remains challenging, partially due to the complexity of insertion screening. Even when achieved, the analysis of protein localization can still be unfeasible in highly packed tissues, where spatial and temporal control of gene labeling would be ideal. Here, we describe SEED/Harvest, an efficient knock-in method based on homology-directed (HDR) and single-strand annealing (SSA) repair pathways. HDR mediates the integration of a switchable cassette. Upon a subsequent CRISPR-triggered repair event, resolved by SSA, the cassette is seamlessly removed. Germline excision of SEED cassettes allows for fast and robust knock-in generation with both fluorescent proteins and short protein tags in tandem. Tissue-specific expression of Cas9 results in somatic cassette excision, conferring spatio-temporal control of protein labelling and the conditional rescue of mutants. Finally, to achieve conditional protein labeling and manipulation of short tag knock-ins, we have developed a toolbox based on rational engineering and functionalization of the ALFA nanobody.",

However, little is known about the synaptic reorganization and circuit mechanisms that lead to broad activity changes. Here we trained a limited subset of neurons in a spiking network with strong synaptic interactions to reproduce the activity of neurons in the motor cortex during a decision-making task. We found that task-related activity, resembling the neural data, emerged across the network, even in the untrained neurons. Analysis of trained networks showed that strong untrained synapses, which were independent of the task and determined the dynamical state of the network, mediated the spread of task-related activity. Optogenetic perturbations suggest that the motor cortex is strongly-coupled, supporting the applicability of the mechanism to cortical networks. Our results reveal a cortical mechanism that facilitates distributed representations of task-variables by spreading the activity from a subset of plastic neurons to the entire network through task-independent strong synapses.",

    "abstract": "Despite their fundamental biological relevance, structure-property relationships in N-glycans are fundamentally lacking, and their highly multidimensional compositional and conformational phase-spaces remain largely unexplored. The torsional flexibility of the glycosidic linkages and the ring dynamics result in wide, rugged free-energy landscapes that are difficult to sample in molecular dynamics simulations. We show that a novel enhanced-sampling scheme combining replica-exchange with solute and collective-variable tempering, enabling transitions over all relevant energy barriers, delivers converged distributions of solvated N-glycan conformers. Several dimensionality-reduction algorithms are compared and employed to generate conformational free-energy maps in two-dimensions. Together with an originally developed conformation-based nomenclature scheme that uniquely identify glycan conformers, our modelling procedure is applied to reveal the effect of chemical substitutions on the conformational ensemble of selected high-mannose-type and complex glycans. Moreover, the structure-prediction capabilities of two commonly used glycan force fields are assessed via the theoretical prediction of experimentally available NMR J-coupling constants. The results confirm the key role of especially{omega} and {psi} torsion angles in discriminating between different conformational states, and suggest an intriguing correlation between the torsional and ring-puckering degrees of freedom that may be biologically relevant.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496605v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cca03org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12c789org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ea2298org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18554b5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Gene transfer agents (GTAs) are virus-like elements that are encoded by some bacterial and archaeal genomes. The production of GTAs can be induced by the carbon depletion and results in host lysis and release of virus-like particles that contain mostly random fragments of the host DNA. The remaining members of a GTA-producing population act as GTA recipients by producing proteins needed for the GTA-mediated DNA acquisition. Here, we detect a codon usage bias towards codons with more readily available tRNAs in the RcGTA-like GTA genes of alphaproteobacterial genomes. Such bias likely improves the translational efficacy during GTA gene expression. While the strength of codon usage bias fluctuates substantially among individual GTA genes and across taxonomic groups, it is especially pronounced in Sphingomonadales, whose members are known to inhabit nutrient-depleted environments. By screening genomes for gene families with similar trends in codon usage biases to those in GTA genes, we found a gene that likely encodes head completion protein in some GTAs were it appeared missing, and 13 genes previously not implicated in GTA lifecycle. The latter genes are involved in various molecular processes, including the homologous recombination and transport of scarce organic matter. Our findings provide insights into the role of selection for translational efficiency in evolution of GTA genes, and outline genes that are potentially involved in the previously hypothesized integration of GTA-delivered DNA into the host genome.\n\nImportanceHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a fundamental process that drives evolution of microorganisms. HGT can result a rapid dissemination of beneficial genes within and among microbial communities, and can be achieved via multiple mechanisms. One peculiar HGT mechanism involves viruses \"domesticated\" by some bacteria and archaea (their hosts). These so-called gene transfer agents (GTAs) are encoded in hosts genomes, produced under starvation conditions, and cannot propagate themselves as viruses. We show that GTA genes are under selection to improve efficiency of their translation when the host activates GTA production. The selection is especially pronounced in bacteria that occupy nutrient-depleted environments. Intriguingly, several genes involved in DNA incorporation into a genome are under similar selection pressure, suggesting that they may facilitate integration of GTA-delivered DNA into the host genome. Our findings underscore the potential importance of GTAs as a mechanism of HGT under nutrient-limited conditions, which are widespread in microbial habitats.",

    "abstract": "Opportunistic pathogens are environmental microbes that are generally harmless and only occasionally cause disease. Unlike obligate pathogens, the growth and survival of opportunistic pathogens does not rely on host infection or transmission. Their versatile lifestyles make it challenging to decipher how and why virulence has evolved in opportunistic pathogens. The Coincidental Evolution Hypothesis (CEH) postulates that virulence results from exaptation or pleiotropy, i.e., traits evolved for adaptation to living in one environment that have a different function in another. Several studies have tested the CEH, but results have been inconclusive. Here we used experimental evolution to determine how the presence of a predator impacts the virulence and fitness of a ubiquitous environmental opportunistic bacterial pathogen that has acquired multi-drug resistance: Serratia marcescens. We evolved S. marcescens in the presence or absence of a generalist protist predator, Tetrahymena thermophila, and evaluated the genotypic and phenotypic changes that occurred after evolution. Overall, we found that evolution in the presence of a predator maintained virulence, whereas evolution in the absence of a predator resulted in attenuated virulence. Strains evolved in the presence or absence of a predator presented different phenotypic traits, such as increased biofilm formation and decreased predation resistance, respectively. Whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing of the evolved populations and isolates revealed multiple cases of parallel evolution in genes associated with virulence. Our results provide evidence that bacterial virulence and virulence related traits are maintained by selective pressures imposed by protist predators, supporting the CEH.",

    "abstract": "Environmental heterogeneity in temperate latitudes is expected to maintain seasonally plastic life-history strategies that include the tuning of morphologies and metabolism that support overwintering. For species that have expanded their ranges into tropical latitudes, it is unclear the extent to which the capacity for plasticity will be maintained or will erode with disuse. The migratory generations of the North American (NA) monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus lead distinctly different lives from their summer generation NA parents and their tropical descendants living in Costa Rica (CR). NA migratory monarchs postpone reproduction, travel thousands of kilometers south to overwinter in Mexico, and subsist on little food for months. Whether recently dispersed populations of monarchs such as those in Costa Rica, which are no longer subject to selection imposed by migration, retain ancestral seasonal plasticity is unclear. To investigate differences in seasonal plasticity, we reared NA and CR monarchs in summer and autumn in Illinois, USA, and measured seasonal reaction norms for aspects of morphology and metabolism related to flight. NA monarchs were seasonally plastic in forewing and thorax size, increasing wing area and thorax to body mass ratio in autumn. While CR monarchs increased thorax mass in autumn, they did not increase the area of the forewing. NA monarchs maintained similar resting and maximal flight metabolic rates across seasons. However, CR monarchs had elevated metabolic rates in autumn. Our findings suggest that the recent expansion of monarchs into habitats that support year-round breeding may be accompanied by (1) the loss of some aspects of morphological plasticity as well as (2) the underlying physiological mechanisms that maintain metabolic homeostasis in the face of temperature heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is the second largest and most widespread extant terrestrial carnivore on Earth and has recently emerged as a medical model for human metabolic diseases. Here, we report a fully-phased chromosome-level assembly of a male North American brown bear built by combining Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi data and publicly available Hi-C data. The final genome size is 2.47 Gigabases (Gb) with a scaffold and contig N50 length of 70.08 and 43.94 Mb, respectively. BUSCO analysis revealed that 94.5% of single-copy orthologs from mammalia were present in the genome (the highest of any ursid genome to date). Repetitive elements accounted for 44.48% of the genome and a total of 20,480 protein coding genes were identified. Based on whole genome alignment, the brown bear is highly syntenic with the polar bear, and our phylogenetic analysis of 7,246 single-copy BUSCOs supports the currently proposed species tree for Ursidae. This highly contiguous genome assembly will support future research on both the evolutionary history of the bear family and the physiological mechanisms behind hibernation, the latter of which has broad medical implications.\n\nSignificanceBrown bears (Ursus arctos) are the most widespread, large terrestrial carnivore on the planet and represent an interesting example of speciation through hybridization, as well as a medical model for sedentary lifestyle-related disease. Although a previous genome for a brown bear has been published, the reported contig N50 was low (only [~]530 kb), despite being scaffolded into putative chromosomes. Genomes of this quality limit the accuracy of analyses which rely on long contiguous stretches of the genome to be assembled (such as with many demographic analyses) as well as attempts at connecting genotype to phenotype (such as in association analyses). In order to support studies on both the complex hybridization history of the brown bear and investigations into medically-relevant phenotypes, we generated a fully-phased, chromosome-level assembly from a male grizzly bear. The genome has a total size of 2.47 Gb and 90% of the genome is contained in 36 scaffolds, roughly corresponding to one autosome per scaffold. This high-quality genome will enable studies across a variety of disciplines, including conservation, evolution, and medicine.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKomagataella phaffii is a commonly used alternative host for manufacturing therapeutic proteins, in part because of its ability to secrete recombinant proteins into the extracellular space. Incorrect processing of secreted proteins by cells can, however, cause non-functional product-related variants, which are expensive to remove in purification and lower overall process yields. The secretion signal peptide, attached to the N-terminus of the recombinant protein, is a major determinant of the quality of the protein sequence and yield. In K. phaffii, the signal peptide from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha mating factor often yields the highest secreted titer of recombinant proteins, but the quality of secreted protein can vary highly.\n\nResultsWe determined that an aggregated product-related variant of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain is caused by N-terminal extension from incomplete cleavage of the signal peptide. We eliminated this variant and improved secreted protein titer up to 76% by extension of the N-terminus with a short, functional peptide moiety or with the EAEA residues from the native signal peptide. We then applied this strategy to three other recombinant subunit vaccine antigens and observed consistent elimination of the same aggregated product-related variant. Finally, we demonstrated that this benefit in quality and secreted titer can be achieved with addition of a single amino acid to the N-terminus of the recombinant protein.\n\nConclusionsOur observations suggest that steric hindrance of proteases in the Golgi that cleave the signal peptide can cause unwanted N-terminal extension and related product variants. We demonstrated that this phenomenon occurs for multiple recombinant proteins, and can be addressed by minimal modification of the N-terminus to improve steric accessibility. This strategy will enable consistent secretion of a broad range of recombinant proteins with the highly productive alpha mating factor secretion signal peptide.",

    "abstract": "When exposed to low oxygen or hypoxia, animals must alter their metabolism and physiology to ensure proper cell-, tissue- and whole-body level adaptations to their hypoxic environment. These alterations often involve changes in gene expression. While extensive work has emphasized the importance of the HIF-1 alpha transcription factor on controlling hypoxia gene expression, less is known about other transcriptional mechanisms. We previously identified the transcription factor FOXO as a regulator of hypoxia tolerance in Drosophila larvae and adults. Here we use an RNA-sequencing approach to identify FOXO-dependent changes in gene expression that are associated with these tolerance effects. We found that hypoxia altered the expression of over 2000 genes and that approximately 40% of these gene expression changes required FOXO. We discovered that hypoxia exposure led to a FOXO-dependent increase in genes involved in cell signaling, such as kinases, GTPase regulators, and regulators of the Hippo/Yorkie pathway. Among these, we identified homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk) as being required for hypoxia survival. We also found that hypoxia suppresses the expression of genes involved in ribosome synthesis and egg production, and we showed that hypoxia suppresses tRNA synthesis and mRNA translation and reduces female fecundity. Among the downregulated genes, we discovered that FOXO was required for suppression of many ribosomal protein genes and genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, pointing to a role for FOXO in limiting energetically costly processes such as protein synthesis and mitochondrial activity upon hypoxic stress. This work uncovers a widespread role for FOXO in mediating hypoxia changes in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive behavior requires the ability to appropriately react to action errors. Post-error slowing of response times (PES) is one of the most reliable phenomena in cognitive neuroscience. It has been proposed that PES is partially achieved through inhibition of the motor system. However, there is no direct evidence for this link - or indeed, that the motor system is physiologically inhibited after errors altogether. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography to measure cortico-spinal excitability (CSE) across four experiments using a Simon task, in which human participants sometimes committed errors. Errors were followed by reduced CSE at two different time points, and in two different modes. Shortly after error commission (250ms) CSE was broadly suppressed - i.e., even task-unrelated motor effectors were inhibited. During the preparation of the subsequent response, CSE was specifically reduced at task-related effectors only. This latter effect was directly related to PES, with stronger CSE suppression accompanying greater PES. This suggests that PES is achieved through increased inhibitory control during post-error responses. To provide converging evidence, we then re-analyzed an openly-available EEG dataset that contained both Simon- and Stop-signal tasks using independent component analysis. We found that the same neural source component that indexed action-cancellation in the stop-signal task also showed clear PES-related activity during post-error responses in the Simon task. Together, these findings provide clear evidence that post-error adaptation is partially achieved through motor inhibition. Moreover, inhibition is engaged in two modes (first non-selective, then selective), aligning with recent multi-stage theories of error processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGermicidal ultraviolet (UV-C) light has been shown as an effective modality for disinfection in laboratory settings and in the operative room. Traditionally, short-wavelength UV-C devices, which have previously been shown to cause DNA damage, are utilized only for disinfection in pre- and post-operative settings and are not continuously active during operations. Continuous use of intraoperative UV light can potentially decrease pathogens and subsequent surgical site infections (SSIs), which arise in approximately 5-15% of operative cases. SSIs are a significant determinant of patient morbidity, readmission rates, and overall cost. Therefore, a method of UV light disinfection with a low risk of DNA damage is needed so that greater antimicrobial protection can be afforded to patients during the entirety of their surgical procedures. A new disinfection device that harnesses longer-wavelength UV-A light to disinfect the surgical field throughout the entirety of the procedure, including pre- and post-operation, has been developed.\n\nMethodsThis study aimed to determine if intraoperatively administered UV-A light was safe, as defined by the minimal presence of DNA damage and safe amounts of reflection upon medical personnel. Using in vitro models, we examined the differential impacts of UV-C and UV-A light on DNA damage and repair pathways. In a murine model, we looked at the difference in production of DNA damage photoproducts between UV-A and UV-C exposure.\n\nResultsOur results show UV-A light does not induce a significant amount of DNA damage at the cellular or tissue level. Furthermore, a preclinical porcine study showed that surgical personnel were exposed to safe levels of UV-A irradiance from an overhead UV-A light used during an operation. The amount of UV-A transmitted through surgical personal protective equipment (PPE) also remained within safe levels.\n\nConclusionsIn conclusion, we found that UV-A may be a safe for intraoperative use.",

    "abstract": "EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) was originally identified as a part of an aberrant EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene in Ewing sarcoma, the second most common pediatric bone cancer. Due to formation of the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene in the tumor genome, the cell loses one wild type EWSR1 allele. Our previous study demonstrated that the loss of ewsr1a (homologue of human EWSR1) in zebrafish leads to the high incidence of mitotic dysfunction, of aneuploidy, and of tumorigenesis in the tp53 mutant background. To dissect the molecular function of EWSR1, we successfully established a stable DLD-1 cell line that enables a conditional knockdown of EWSR1 using Auxin Inducible Degron (AID) system. When both EWSR1 genes of DLD-1 cell were tagged with mini-AID at its 5-end using CRISPR/Cas9 system, treatment of the (AID-EWSR1/AID-EWSR1) DLD-1 cells with a plant-based Auxin (AUX) led to the significant levels of degradation of AID-EWSR1 proteins. During anaphase, the EWSR1 knockdown (AUX+) cells displayed higher incidence of lagging chromosomes compared to the control (AUX-) cells. This defect was proceeded by a lower incidence of the localization of Aurora B at inner centromeres, and by a higher incidence of the protein at kinetochores compared to the control cells during pro/metaphase. Despite these defects, the EWSR1 knockdown cells did not undergo mitotic arrest, suggesting that the cell lacks the error correction mechanism. Significantly, the EWSR1 knockdown (AUX+) cells induced higher incidence of aneuploidy compared to the control (AUX-) cells. Since our previous study demonstrated that EWSR1 interacts with the key mitotic kinase, Aurora B, we generated replacement lines of EWSR1-mCherry and EWSR1:R565A-mCherry (a mutant that has low affinity for Aurora B) in the (AID-EWSR1/AID-EWSR1) DLD-1 cells. The EWSR1-mCherry rescued the high incidence of aneuploidy of EWSR1 knockdown cells, whereas EWSR1-mCherry:R565A failed to rescue the phenotype. Together, we demonstrate that EWSR1 is essential to prevent aneuploidy through interaction with Aurora B, most likely by regulating the localization of Aurora B at centromere.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) causes disabling and incurable muscle contractures that result from impaired longitudinal growth of denervated muscles. This deficit in muscle growth is driven by increased proteasome-mediated protein degradation, suggesting a dysregulation of muscle proteostasis. The myostatin (MSTN) pathway, a prominent muscle-specific regulator of proteostasis, is a putative signaling mechanism by which neonatal denervation could impair longitudinal muscle growth, and thus a potential target to prevent NBPI-induced contractures. Through a mouse model of NBPI, our present study revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of MSTN signaling induces hypertrophy, restores longitudinal growth, and prevents contractures in denervated muscles of female but not male mice, despite inducing hypertrophy of normally innervated muscles in both sexes. Additionally, the MSTN-dependent impairment of longitudinal muscle growth after NBPI in female mice is associated with perturbation of 20S proteasome activity, but not through alterations in canonical MSTN signaling pathways. These findings reveal a sex dimorphism in the regulation of neonatal longitudinal muscle growth and contractures, thereby providing insights into contracture pathophysiology, identifying a potential muscle-specific therapeutic target for contracture prevention, and underscoring the importance of sex as a biological variable in the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders.",

    "abstract": "As biomass dynamics capture information on population dynamics and ecosystem-level processes (e.g., changes in production over time), understanding how rising temperatures associated with global climate change influence biomass dynamics is a pressing issue in ecology. The total biomass of a species depends on its density and its average mass. Disentangling how biomass dynamics may respond to increasingly warm and variable temperatures may thus ultimately depend on understanding how temperature influences both density and mass dynamics. Here, we address this issue by keeping track of experimental microbial populations growing to carrying capacity for 15 days at two different temperatures in the presence and absence of temperature variability. We show that temperature influences biomass through its effects on density and mass dynamics, which have opposite effects on biomass and can offset each other. We also show that temperature variability influences biomass, but that effect is independent of any effects on density or mass dynamics. Last, we show that reciprocal effects of density and mass shift significantly across temperature regimes, suggesting that rapid and environment-dependent eco-phenotypic dynamics underlie biomass responses. Overall, our results connect temperature effects on population and phenotypic dynamics to explain how biomass responds to temperature regimes, thus shedding light on processes at play in cosmopolitan and massively abundant microbes as the world experiences increasingly hot and variable temperatures.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, great strides have been made to quantify the dynamics of single-cell growth and division in microbes. In order to make sense of the evolutionary history of these organisms, we must understand how features of single-cell growth and division influence evolutionary dynamics. This requires us to connect processes on the single-cell scale to population dynamics. Here, we consider a model of microbial growth in finite populations which explicitly incorporates the single-cell dynamics. We study the behavior of a mutant population in such a model and ask: can the evolutionary dynamics be coarse-grained so that the forces of natural selection and genetic drift can be expressed in terms of the long-term fitness? We show that it is in fact not possible, as there is no way to define a single fitness parameter (or reproductive rate) that defines the fate of an organism even in a constant environment. This is due to fluctuations in the population averaged division rate. As a result, various details of the single-cell dynamics affect the fate of a new mutant independently from how they affect the long-term growth rate of the mutant population. In particular, we show that in the case of neutral mutations, variability in generation times increases the rate of genetic drift, and in the case of beneficial mutations, variability decreases its fixation probability. Furthermore, we explain the source of the persistent division rate fluctuations and provide analytic solutions for the fixation probability as a multi-species generalization of the Euler-Lotka equation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that the human germline mutation rate and spectrum evolve rapidly. Variation in generation time has been linked to these changes, though its contribution remains unclear. We develop a framework to characterize temporal changes in polymorphisms within and between populations, while controlling for the effects of natural selection and biased gene conversion. Application to the 1000 Genomes Project dataset reveals multiple independent changes that arose after the split of continental groups, including a previously reported, transient elevation in TCC>TTC mutations in Europeans and novel signals of divergence in C>G and T>A mutation rates among population samples. We also find a significant difference between groups sampled in and outside of Africa, in old T>C polymorphisms that predate the out-of-Africa migration. This surprising signal is driven by TpG>CpG mutations, and stems in part from mis-polarized CpG transitions, which are more likely to undergo recurrent mutations. Finally, by relating the mutation spectrum of polymorphisms to parental age effects on de novo mutations, we show that plausible changes in the generation time cannot explain the patterns observed for different mutation types jointly. Thus, other factors--genetic modifiers or environmental exposures--must have had a non-negligible impact on the human mutation landscape.",

Genotypic identification through whole-genome sequencing was performed and confirmed in silico. Resistance and plasmid profiles were studied using ResFinder4.0 and Plasmid-Finder2.1. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was used to determine the isolates clonality.\n\nResultsANI identified and confirmed that 47 (80%) isolates were E. hormaechei, 11 (18%) were Klebsiella aerogenes and 1 (2%) was an E. cloacae. Carbapenem-resistance was detected among 41 isolates all showing an MIC90 of [&ge;] 32 {micro}g/ml for ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem. blaNDM-1 (58.5%), blaACT-16 (54%), and blaOXA-1 (54%) were the most common detected {beta}-lactamases, while blaCTX-M-15 gene (68%) was the main detected extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase (ESBL) encoding gene. Chromosomal ampC gene, carbapenemase encoding genes, and porin modifications were among the detected carbapenem resistance determinants. The carbapenemase encoding genes were linked to three well-defined plasmid Inc groups, IncFII/IncFIB, IncX3, and IncL. MLST typing revealed the diversity within the studied isolates, with ST114 being the most common amongst the studied E. hormaechei.\n\nConclusionThe spread of carbapenem-resistant isolates in clinical settings in Lebanon is a serious challenge.

    "abstract": "Spatial heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in gaining insights into tumor development and progression. Conventional metrics typically capture the spatial differential between TME cellular architectures by either exploring the cell distributions in a pairwise fashion or aggregating the heterogeneity across multiple cell distributions without considering for the spatial contribution. As such, none of the existing approaches has fully accounted for the heterogeneity caused by both cellular diversity and spatial configurations of multiple cell categories. In this article, we propose an approach to leverage the spatial entropy measures at multiple distance ranges to account for the spatial heterogeneity across different cellular architectures. Then, functional principal component analysis (FPCA) targeting sparse data is applied to estimate FPC scores which are then predictors in a Cox regression model to investigate the impact of spatial heterogeneity in the TME on survival outcome, holding other clinical variables constant. Using an ovarian cancer dataset (n = 114) as a case study, we found that the spatial heterogeneity in the TME immune compositions of CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD68+ macrophages, had a significant non-zero effect on the overall survival (p = 0.027). In the simulations studies under different spatial configurations, the proposed method demonstrated a high predictive power by accounting for both clinical effect and the impact of spatial heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "1BackgroundModern clinical genetic tests utilize next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to comprehensively analyze genetic variants from patients. Out of these millions of variants, clinically relevant variants that match the patients phenotype need to be identified accurately within a rapid timeframe that facilitates clinical action. As manual evaluation of variants is not a feasible option for meeting the speed and volume requirements of clinical genetic testing, automated solutions are needed. Various machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and in silico variant pathogenicity predictors have been developed to solve this challenge. These solutions rely on the comprehensiveness of the available data and struggle with the sparse nature of genetic variant data. Therefore, careful treatment of missing data is necessary, and the selected methods may have a huge impact on the accuracy, reliability, speed and associated computational costs.\n\nResultsWe present an open-source framework called AMISS that can be used to evaluate performance of different methods for handling missing genetic variant data in the context of variant pathogenicity prediction. Using AMISS, we evaluated 14 methods for handling missing values. The performance of these methods varied substantially in terms of precision, computational costs, and other attributes. Overall, simpler imputation methods and specifically mean imputation performed best.\n\nConclusionsSelection of the missing data handling method is crucial for AI/ML-based classification of genetic variants. We show that utilizing sophisticated imputation methods is not worth the cost when used in the context of genetic variant pathogenicity classification.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, glucose transporters (GLUT) control organism-wide blood glucose homeostasis. In human, this is accomplished by fourteen different GLUT isoforms, that transport glucose and other monosaccharides with varying substrate preferences and kinetics. Nevertheless, there is little difference between the sugar-coordinating residues in the GLUT proteins and even the malarial plasmodium falciparum transporter PfHT1, which is uniquely able to transport a wide range of different sugars. PfHT1 was captured in an intermediate \"occluded\" state, revealing how the extracellular gating helix TM7b has moved to break and occlude the sugar-binding site. Sequence difference and kinetics indicated that the TM7b gating helix dynamics and interactions likely evolved to enable substrate promiscuity in PfHT1, rather than the sugar-binding site itself. It was unclear, however, if the TM7b structural transitions observed in PfHT1 would be similar in the other GLUT proteins. Here, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the fructose transporter GLUT5 spontaneously transitions through an occluded state that closely resembles PfHT1. The coordination of fructose lowers the energetic barriers between the outward and inward-facing states, and the observed binding mode for fructose is consistent with biochemical analysis. Rather than a substrate binding site that achieves strict specificity by having a high-affinity for the substrate, we conclude GLUT proteins have allosterically coupled sugar binding with an extracellular gate that forms the high-affinity transition-state instead. This substrate-coupling pathway presumably enables the catalysis of fast sugar flux at physiological relevant blood-glucose concentrations.",

When the B value of a particular specie is not known, one possibility Is to use as a proxy the B value of a specie from the same genus, but this can cause the estimate of %Ndfa to be inaccurate. In this work, we compared two methodologies for determining the B value of Crotalaria juncea, C. spectabilis, C. ochroleuca and Cajanus cajan, using soil as the substrate. One method involvedgrowing plants in soil and averaging the lowest {delta}15N values of plant shoots (B-minimum), while the other consisted in adding sucrose to soil to immobilize the mineral nitrogen (N-immobilized), and then averaging the shoot {delta}15N values of all plants. Results showed that B values of C. cajan and C. ochroleuca obtained using the N-immobilized method were up to 1{per thousand} lower than those reported in the literature for these species. Therefore, we propose that, at least in these species, B values determined with the N-immobilized method should be used to estimate the%Ndfa.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are the brains resident immune cells, performing surveillance to promote homeostasis and healthy functioning. While chemical signaling in microglia is well-studied, the mechanical cues regulating their function are less well-understood. Here, we investigate the role of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in microglia migration, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and stiffness sensing. We demonstrated the functional expression of Piezo1 in microglia and identified genes whose expression was affected by conditional Piezo1 knockout in transgenic mice. Functional assays revealed that Piezo1-deficiency in microglia enhanced migration towards amyloid {beta}-protein, and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide, both in vitro and in vivo. The phenomenon could be mimicked or reversed using a Piezo1-specific agonist or antagonist. Finally, we also showed that Piezo1 mediated the effect of substrate stiffness-induced migration and cytokine expression. Altogether, we show that Piezo1 is an important molecular mediator for microglia, its activation modulating their migration and immune responses.",

Yet the exact process by which learned predictions become pleasurable is unclear. Here, we created novel melodies in an alternative scale different from any established musical culture, to show how musical preference is generated de novo. Across nine studies (n=1185), participants learned to like more frequently-presented items that adhered to this rapidly-learned structure, suggesting that exposure and prediction errors both affected self-report liking ratings. Learning trajectories varied by music reward sensitivity, but were similar for USA and Chinese participants. Furthermore, fMRI activity in auditory areas reflected prediction errors whereas functional connectivity between auditory and medial prefrontal regions reflected both exposure and prediction errors. Collectively, results support predictive coding as a cognitive mechanism by which new musical sounds become rewarding.",

    "abstract": "We describe a methodology utilizing high-throughput and high-content screening for novel adjuvant candidates that was used to screen a library of [~]2,500 small molecules via a 384-well quantitative combined cytokine and flow cytometry immunoassay in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 healthy adult study participants. Hits were identified based on their induction of soluble cytokine (TNF, IFN{gamma} and IL-10) secretion and PBMC maturation (CD 80/86, Ox40, and HLA-DR) in at least two of the four donors screened. From an initial set of 197 compounds identified using these biomarkers--an 8.6% hit rate--we downselected to five scaffolds that demonstrated robust efficacy and potency in vitro and evaluated the top hit, vinblastine sulfate, for adjuvanticity in vivo. Vinblastine sulfate significantly enhanced murine humoral responses to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, including a four-fold enhancement of IgG titer production when compared to treatment with the spike antigen alone. Overall, we outline a methodology for discovering immunomodulators with adjuvant potential via high-throughput screening of PBMCs in vitro that yielded a lead compound with in vivo adjuvanticity.\n\nMotivationVaccines are a key biomedical intervention to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, but their efficacy can be limited by insufficient immunogenicity and nonuniform reactogenic profiles. Adjuvants are molecules that potentiate vaccine responses by inducing innate immune activation. However, there are a limited number of adjuvants in approved vaccines, and current approaches for preclinical adjuvant discovery and development are inefficient. To enhance adjuvant identification, we developed a protocol based on in vitro screening of human primary leukocytes.",

The inability to monitor in vivo the low abundance, heterocellular phenotypes that resist treatment and ultimately lead to patient death limits the ability to design precision therapies. Here we overcome limitations in multiplexed fluorescence phenotyping to introduce real-time, cellular resolution visualization of tumor heterogeneity in vivo. This method was performed to simultaneously map for the first time 5 individual biomarkers of stemness, proliferation, metabolism, leukocytes and angiogenesis deep within the peritoneal cavities of micrometastatic cancer mouse models at 17 frames per second (fps). The newly developed imaging system revealed distinct cancer cell phenotype-immune cell spatial correlations and clearly visualized the dynamic spatial response of resistant cancer cell niches following treatment. Furthermore, wide-field datasets were generated to facilitate derivation of a mathematical framework for quantifying biomarker spatial variation and thereby overcoming the area restrictions of conventional tumor biopsy. These results pave the way for real-time identification of cancer cell phenotypes in a clinical setting, on which optimized treatment regimens can be based for personalized treatment and precision therapy e.g., tumor margin determination during surgical resection.
