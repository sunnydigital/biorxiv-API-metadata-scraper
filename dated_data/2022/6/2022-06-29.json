    "abstract": "Elucidating the dynamics of cellular differentiation in space and time is key to advancing organoid biology and technology. Direct visualization of differentiation patterns is challenging, however, in part because of the difficulty of simultaneously detecting all relevant cell types by fluorescence imaging. Here we present TypeTracker, which determines the differentiation trajectories of all cells within a region of interest, including their type transitions, growth, divisions, and changes in spatial organization. We show how the lineage tree topology, as determined by automated cell tracking, allows for the retrospective identification of cell types across multiple generations. The data revealed various surprising aspects of intestinal organoid differentiation, including symmetric fate adoption by sister cells, cell type abundance regulated by division, and type commitment of cells occurring prior to their spatial reorganization. Our method can be applied broadly to study other organoid systems and to screen for compounds that affect differentiation programs.",

    "abstract": "The additional protonophoric function of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT1) is now recognized. However, the molecular mechanism remains controversial. Fatty acid (FA) cycling hypothesis postulates that FAs transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane to the matrix by a flip-flop, whereas ANT1 facilitates the translocation of FA anions (FA-) back to the intermembrane space. By a combined approach involving measurements of current through the planar lipid bilayers reconstituted with recombinant ANT1, site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that FA- is initially caught by R59 on the matrix side of ANT1, then moves along the positively charged protein-lipid interface, and binds to R79, where it is protonated in the hydrated cavity in the presence of D134. R79 is crucial for the competitive binding of ANT1 substrates (ATP and ADP) and inhibitors (carboxyatractyloside, bongkrekic acid). The binding sites are well-conserved in mitochondrial SLC25 members, implying a general transporting mechanism for FA anions.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic reporter genes based on gas vesicles (GVs) have enabled the use of ultrasound to noninvasively visualize cellular function in vivo. The specific detection of GV signals relative to background acoustic scattering in tissues is facilitated by nonlinear ultrasound imaging techniques taking advantage of the sonomechanical buckling of GVs. However, the effect of geometry on the buckling behavior of GVs under exposure to ultrasound has not been studied. To understand such geometric effects, we developed computational models of GVs of various lengths and diameters and used finite element simulations to predict their threshold buckling pressures and post-buckling deformations. We demonstrated that the GV diameter has an inverse cubic relation to the threshold buckling pressure, whereas length has no substantial effect. To complement these simulations, we experimentally probed the effect of geometry on the mechanical properties of GVs and the corresponding nonlinear ultrasound signals. The results of these experiments corroborate our computational predictions. This study provides fundamental insights into how geometry affects the sonomechanical properties of GVs, which, in turn, can inform further engineering of these nanostructures for high-contrast, nonlinear ultrasound imaging.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEGas vesicles (GVs) are an emerging class of genetically encodable and engineerable imaging agents for ultrasound whose sonomechanical buckling generates nonlinear contrast to enable sensitive and specific imaging in highly scattering biological systems. Though the effect of protein composition on GV buckling has been studied, the effect of geometry has not previously been addressed. This study reveals that geometry, especially GV diameter, significantly alters the threshold acoustic pressures required to induce GV buckling. Our computational predictions and experimental results provide fundamental understanding of the relationship between GV geometry and buckling properties and underscore the utility of GVs for nonlinear ultrasound imaging. Additionally, our results provide suggestions to further engineer GVs to enable in vivo ultrasound imaging with greater sensitivity and higher contrast.",

    "abstract": "Body-mounted accelerometers provide a new prospect for estimating power use in flying birds, as the signal varies with the two major kinematic determinants of aerodynamic power: wingbeat frequency and amplitude. Yet wingbeat frequency is sometimes used as a proxy for power output in isolation. There is therefore a need to understand which kinematic parameter birds vary and whether this is predicted by flight mode (e.g., accelerating, ascending/descending flight), speed or morphology. We investigate this using high-frequency acceleration data from (i) 14 species flying in the wild, (ii) two species flying in controlled conditions in a wind tunnel and (iii) a review of experimental and field studies. While wingbeat frequency and amplitude were positively correlated, R2 values were generally low, supporting the idea that parameters can vary independently. Indeed, birds were more likely to modulate wingbeat amplitude for more energy-demanding flight modes, including climbing and take-off. Nonetheless, the striking variability even within species and flight types, highlights the complexity of describing the kinematic relationships, which appear sensitive to both the biological and physical context. Notwithstanding this acceleration metrics that incorporate both kinematic parameters should be more robust proxies for power than wingbeat frequency alone.",

    "abstract": "Many biological materials contain fibrous protein networks as their main structural components. Understanding the mechanical properties of such networks is important for creating biomimicking materials for cell and tissue engineering, and for developing novel tools for detecting and diagnosing disease. In this work, we develop continuum models for isotropic, athermal fibrous networks by combining a single-fiber model that describes the axial response of individual fibers, with network models that assemble individual fiber properties into overall network behavior. In particular, we consider four different network models, including the affine, three-chain, eight-chain, and micro-sphere models, which employ different assumptions about network structure and kinematics. We systematically investigate the ability of these models to describe the mechanical response of athermal collagen and fibrin networks by comparing model predictions with experimental data. We test how each model captures network behavior under three different loading conditions: uniaxial tension, simple shear, and combined tension and shear. We find that the affine and three-chain models can accurately describe both the axial and shear behavior, whereas the eight-chain and micro-sphere models fail to capture the shear response, leading to an unphysical zero shear moduli at infinitesimal strains. Our study is the first to systematically investigate the applicability of popular network models for describing the macroscopic behavior of athermal fibrous networks, offering insights for selecting efficient models that can be used for large-scale, finite-element simulations of athermal networks.",

    "abstract": "3D single-particle tracking has the potential to resolve the molecular level forces which dictate particle motion in biological systems. However, the information gleaned from 3D single-particle tracking often cannot resolve underlying nanoscale potentials due to limited spatiotemporal resolution. To this end, we introduce an active-feedback 3D tracking microscope that utilizes silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as probes to study intricate biophysical events in live cells at the nanometer and microsecond scales. Due to this extremely high and durable scattering photon flux of the plasmonic particles, 1 MHz sampling frequency at nanometer precision in all three dimensions can be achieved over an unlimited observation times. In this work, we applied microsecond-sampling, active-feedback 3D single-particle tracking to investigate the interaction between AgNPs and nanoscale filopodium on the live-cell surface. The nanometer precision and microsecond sampling revealed that TAT peptide modified particles visit and dwell at local \"hot spots\" on the filopodium surface. The high sampling rate further enabled the calculation of the local forces and potentials within these nanoscale hotspots on the cylindrical surface of live cell filopodia. This study presents a promising tool to investigate intracellular biophysical events with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution and a pipeline to study nanoscale potentials on three-dimensional cellular structures.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) can function as autoregulators of folded enzymes to which they are tethered. One example is the bacterial cell division protein, FtsZ. This includes a folded core and a C-terminal tail (CTT) that encompasses a poorly conserved, disordered C-terminal linker (CTL) and a well-conserved 17-residue C-terminal peptide (CT17). Sites for GTPase activity of FtsZs are formed at the interface between GTP binding sites and T7 loops on cores of adjacent subunits within dimers. Here, we explore the basis of autoregulatory functions of the CTT in Bacillus subtilis FtsZ (Bs-FtsZ). Molecular simulations show that the CT17 of Bs- FtsZ makes statistically significant CTL-mediated contacts with the T7 loop. Statistical Coupling Analysis of more than 103 sequences from FtsZ orthologs reveals clear covariation of the T7 loop and the CT17 with most of the core domain whereas the CTL is under independent selection. Despite this, we discover the conservation of non-random sequence patterns within CTLs across orthologs. To test how the non-random patterns of CTLs mediate CTT-core interactions and modulate FtsZ functionalities, we designed Bs-FtsZ variants by altering the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the CTL. Such alterations disrupt the core-CTT interactions, lead to anomalous assembly and inefficient GTP hydrolysis in vitro and protein degradation, aberrant assembly, and disruption of cell division in vivo. Our findings suggest that viable CTLs in FtsZs are likely to be IDRs that encompass non-random, functionally relevant sequence patterns that also preserve three-way covariation of the CT17, the T7 loop, and core domain.\n\nSignificance StatementZ-ring formation by the protein FtsZ controls cell division in rod-shaped bacteria. The C-terminus of FtsZ encompasses a disordered C-terminal linker (CTL) and a conserved CT17 motif. Both modules are essential for Z-ring formation and proper localization of FtsZ in cells. Previous studies suggested that generic intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) might be suitable functional replacements for naturally occurring CTLs. Contrary to this suggestion, we find that the sequence-encoded conformational properties of CTLs help mediate autoregulatory interactions between covarying regions within FtsZ. Functional properties of the CTL are encoded via evolutionarily conserved, non-random sequence patterns. Disruption of these patterns impair molecular functions and cellular phenotypes. Our findings have broad implications for discovering functionally consequential sequence features within IDRs of other proteins.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregates are often varying extensively in their morphological characteristics, which may lead to various biological outcomes related to e.g., immunogenicity risk. However, isolation of aggregates with a specific morphology within an ensemble is often challenging. To gain vital knowledge on the effects of aggregate characteristics, samples containing a single morphology must be produced by direct control of the aggregation process. Moreover, the formed aggregates need to be in a solvent suitable for biological assays, while keeping their morphology intact. Here we evaluated the dependence of morphology and integrity of amyloid-like fibrils and spherulites on preparation conditions and post-treatment methods. Samples containing either amyloid-like fibrils or spherulites produced from human insulin in acetic acid solutions are dependent on the presence of salt (NaCl). Moreover, mechanical shaking (600 rpm) inhibits spherulite formation, while only affecting the length of the formed fibrils compared to quiescent conditions. Besides shaking, the initial protein concentration in the formulation was found to control fibril length. Surprisingly, exchanging the solvent used for aggregate formation to a physiologically relevant buffer, had a striking effect on the morphological integrity of the fibril and spherulite samples. Especially the secondary structure of one of our spherulite samples presented dramatic changes of the aggregated {beta}-sheet content after solvent exchange, emphasizing the importance of the aggregate stability. These results and considerations have profound implications on the data interpretation and should be implemented in the workflow for both fundamental characterization of aggregates as well as assays for evaluation of their corresponding biological effects.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensitive Piezo channels convert mechanical stimuli into biological signals in vertebrates. Piezo1 chemical modulators are anticipated to yield many clinical benefits. To date, Yoda1 is the most potent and widely used Piezo1-selective agonist, yet how Yoda1 interacts with Piezo1 at the protein-membrane interface and stabilizes Piezo1s open state remains elusive. Here, using a previously identified putative Yoda1 binding site and three molecular dynamics (MD)-based methods, we computed the binding free energies of Yoda1 and its analogs in a Piezo1 cryo-EM closed state and an in silico open state. Our computed absolute binding free energy of Yoda1 in the closed state agrees well with the experimental Kd in which Piezo1 is expected to be in a closed state. More importantly, Yoda1 binds the open state better than the closed state, in agreement with its agonist effects. All three methods predicted that Dooku1, a Yoda1 analog, binds the closed state stronger than Yoda1, but binds the open state weaker than Yoda1. These results are consistent with the fact that Dooku1 antagonizes the effects of Yoda1 but lacks the ability to activate Piezo1. The relative binding free energies of seven Yoda1 analogs recapitulate key experimental structure-activity-relationships (SAR). Based on the state-dependent binding free energies, we were able to predict whether a molecule is an agonist or inhibitor and whether a chemical modification will lead to a change in affinity or efficacy. These mechanistic insights and computational workflow designed for transmembrane binders open an avenue to structural-based screening and design of novel Piezo1 agonists and inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Piezo proteins are mechanosensitive ion channels that can locally curve the membrane into a dome shape (Y. R. Guo, R. MacKinnon, 2017). The curved shape of the Piezo dome is expected to deform the surrounding lipid bilayer membrane into a membrane footprint, which may serve to amplify Piezos sensitivity to applied forces (C. A. Haselwandter, R. MacKinnon, 2018). If Piezo proteins are embedded in lipid bilayer vesicles, the membrane shape deformations induced by the Piezo dome depend on the vesicle size. We employ here membrane elasticity theory to predict, with no free parameters, the shape of such Piezo vesicles outside the Piezo dome, and show that the predicted vesicle shapes agree quantitatively with the corresponding measured vesicle shapes obtained through cryo-electron tomography, for a range of vesicle sizes (Helfrich W. 1973). On this basis, we explore the coupling between Piezo and membrane shape, and demonstrate that the features of the Piezo dome affecting Piezos membrane footprint follow approximately a spherical cap geometry. Our work puts into place the foundation for deducing key elastic properties of the Piezo dome from membrane shape measurements and provides a general framework for quantifying how proteins deform bilayer membranes.\n\nClassificationBiophysicss",

    "abstract": "The fine regulation of actin polymerization is essential to control cell motility, architecture and to perform essential cellular functions. Formins are key regulators of actin filament assembly, known to processively elongate filament barbed ends and increase their polymerization rate. Based on indirect observations, different models have been proposed to describe the molecular mechanism governing the processive motion of formin FH2 domains at polymerizing barbed ends. Using electron microscopy, we directly identified two conformations of the mDia1 formin FH2 domains in interaction with the barbed ends of actin filaments. These conformations agree with the open and closed conformations of the \"stair stepping\" model proposed by Otomo and colleagues1. We observed the FH2 dimers to be in the open conformation for 79% of the data, interacting with the two terminal actin subunits of the barbed end, while they interact with three actin subunits in the closed conformation. Further, our data reveal that the open state encompasses a continuum of states where the orientation of the leading FH2 domain with respect to the filament long axis varies from 108 to 135 degrees. In addition, we identified FH2 domains encircling the core of actin filaments, providing structural information for mDia1 away from the barbed end. Based on these direct observations, we propose a model of formin in interaction with the growing filament end, as well as with the core of the filament.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhen localising a moving object, the brain receives outdated sensory information about its position, due to the time required for neural transmission and processing. The brain may overcome these fundamental delays through predictively encoding the position of moving objects using information from their past trajectories. In the present study, we evaluated this proposition using multivariate analysis of high temporal resolution electroencephalographic data. We tracked neural position representations of moving objects at different stages of visual processing, relative to the real-time position of the object. During early stimulus-evoked activity, position representations of moving objects were activated substantially earlier than the equivalent activity evoked by unpredictable flashes, aligning the earliest representations of moving stimuli with their real-time positions. These findings indicate that the predictability of straight trajectories enables full compensation for the neural delays accumulated early in stimulus processing, but that delays still accumulate across later stages of cortical processing.",

    "abstract": "The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) shows robust activation during the perception of faces and voices. However, little is known about what categorical features of social stimuli drive neural activity in this region. Since perception of identity and expression are critical social functions, we examined whether neural responses to naturalistic stimuli were driven by these two categorial features in the prefrontal cortex. We recorded single neurons in the VLPFC, while two macaques viewed short audiovisual videos of unfamiliar conspecifics making expressions of aggressive, affiliative, and neutral valence. Of the 285 neurons responsive to the audiovisual stimuli, 111 neurons had a main effect (two-way ANOVA) of identity, expression or their interaction in their stimulus related firing rates; however, decoding of expression and identity using single unit firing rates rendered poor accuracy. Interestingly, when decoding from pseudopopulations of recorded neurons, the accuracy for both expression and identity increased with population size, suggesting that the population transmitted information relevant to both variables. Principal components analysis of mean population activity across time revealed that population responses to the same identity followed similar trajectories in the response space, facilitating segregation from other identities. Our results suggest that identity is a critical feature of social stimuli that dictates the structure of population activity in the VLPFC, during the perception of vocalizations and their corresponding facial expressions. These findings enhance our understanding of social behavior beyond the temporal lobe in macaques and humans.\n\nSignificance StatementPrimates are unique in their ability to process and utilize complex, multisensory social information. The brain networks that support this are distributed across the temporal and frontal lobes. In this study, we characterize how social variables like identity and expression are encoded in the neural activity of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a prefrontal region of the macaque brain. We found that single neurons do not appear to encode these variables, but populations of neurons display similar activity patterns that are primarily differentiated by the identity of the conspecific that a macaque is attending to. Furthermore, by employing dynamic, multisensory stimuli, our experiment better approximates real world conditions, making our findings more generalizable.",

    "abstract": "Humans are able to adapt to the fast-changing world by estimating statistical regularities of the environment. Although fear can profoundly impact adaptive behaviors, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we conducted a behavioral experiment (n = 21) and a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (n = 37) with a novel cue-biased adaptation learning task, during which we simultaneously manipulated emotional valence (fearful/neutral expressions of the cue) and environmental volatility (frequent/infrequent reversals of reward probabilities). Across two experiments, computational modelling consistently revealed a higher learning rate for the environment with frequent versus infrequent reversals following neutral cues. In contrast, this flexible adjustment was absent in the environment with fearful cues, suggesting a suppressive role of fear in adaptation to environmental volatility. This suppressive effect was underpinned by activity of the posterior parietal cortex, ventral striatum, hippocampus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as well as increased functional connectivity between the dACC and temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) for fear with environmental volatility. Dynamic causal modelling identified that the driving effect was located in the TPJ and was associated with dACC activation, suggesting that the suppression of fear on adaptive behaviors occurs at the early stage of bottom-up processing. These findings provide a neuro-computational account of how fear interferes with adaptation to volatility during dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous brain activity builds the foundation for human cognitive processing during external demands. Neuroimaging studies based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) identified specific characteristics of spontaneous (intrinsic) brain dynamics to be associated with individual differences in general cognitive ability, i.e., intelligence. However, fMRI research is inherently limited by low temporal resolution, thus, preventing conclusions about neural fluctuations within the range of milliseconds. Here, we used resting-state electroencephalographical (EEG) recordings from 144 healthy adults to test whether individual differences in intelligence (Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices scores) can be predicted from the complexity of temporally highly resolved intrinsic brain signals. We compared different operationalizations of brain signal complexity (multiscale entropy, Shannon entropy, Fuzzy entropy, and specific characteristics of microstates) regarding their relation to intelligence. The results indicate that associations between brain signal complexity measures and intelligence are of small effect sizes (r ~ .20) and vary across different spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, higher intelligence scores were associated with lower complexity in local aspects of neural processing, and less activity in task-negative brain regions belonging to the defaultmode network. Finally, we combined multiple measures of brain signal complexity to show that individual intelligence scores can be significantly predicted with a multimodal model within the sample (10-fold cross-validation) as well as in an independent sample (external replication, N = 57). In sum, our results highlight the temporal and spatial dependency of associations between intelligence and intrinsic brain dynamics, proposing multimodal approaches as promising means for future neuroscientific research on complex human traits.\n\nSignificance StatementSpontaneous brain activity builds the foundation for intelligent processing - the ability of humans to adapt to various cognitive demands. Using resting-state EEG, we extracted multiple aspects of temporally highly resolved intrinsic brain dynamics to investigate their relationship with individual differences in intelligence. Single associations were of small effect sizes and varied critically across spatial and temporal scales. However, combining multiple measures in a multimodal cross-validated prediction model, allows to significantly predict individual intelligence scores in unseen participants. Our study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that observable associations between complex human traits and neural parameters might be rather small and proposes multimodal prediction approaches as promising tool to derive robust brain-behavior relations despite limited sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of electrical activities are observed to occur in the brain. They include one dimensional voltage pulses (action potentials) that propagate along nerve fibers, transient localized oscillations, and persistent surface waveforms oscillating in five distinct frequency bands, called EEG waveforms. However, although a satisfactory theory for propagating pulses exists a unified theoretical framework for modeling all its excitations is lacking. In this paper we construct a special surface network in which all observed brain-like signals can be generated by topological means. The network has surface electrons,is, as we will prove, an exact topological surface representation of the unknown intricate connectivity architecture of the brains nerve fibers, and its surface has a mathematical representation. A dynamical law which requires that all input and out put signals of the network respect the mathematical structure of the surface is used to study the network. Using this law it is shown that all brain-like signals can be generated by input signals that locally deform the surface of a subunit of the network, transiently, reducing its topology to that of a sphere. The topological spheres thus produced have surface voltage oscillating waveforms in five theoretically determined frequencies bands and are identified as EEG waveforms. Methods for analyzing these waveforms are developed and used to explain their observed deep sleep structures and determine their properties.",

Yet the microbial functions that underpin this succession are not well described. Further, its unclear how previous precipitation frames microbial capacities after rewetting and how long these effects persist. We used isotopically-labeled water to rewet seasonally dry annual grassland soil that experienced either mean annual or reduced precipitation during the previous two years, and sampled at five subsequent time points. We used quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP)-informed genome- resolved metagenomics to identify growing microorganisms, predict their capabilities, and analyze how these traits differed over time and between precipitation treatments. Organisms that grew after wetup were more abundant than non-growing organisms prior to the wet-up, suggesting that traits that initiate succession are pre-defined at the end of the prior plant growing season or via survival over the summer. Fast-growing organisms had fewer carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) genes per genome than slower-growing organisms, suggesting that although fast-growers were capable of degrading complex C, they may not specialize in this process. Differential abundance of CAZy genes in growing organisms throughout the succession implies that substrate availability varied with time. In contrast, the abundance of peptidases in growing organisms differed between precipitation treatments, but not over time following wet-up. Before wet-up, the soil organisms gene inventories were different between the two precipitation treatments. Surprisingly, this legacy effect waned after just one week. Thus, pre-wetup differences in microbial functional capacity converged shortly after rewetting.",

Here, we found that hyperosmotic stress for a few minutes induces Warburg-like metabolic remodeling in HeLa and Raw264.7 cells and suppresses fatty acid oxidation. Regarding Warburg-like remodeling, the PDH phosphorylation status was altered bidirectionally (high in hyperosmolarity and low in hypoosmolarity) to osmotic stress in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondria themselves have an acute osmo-sensing mechanism. Warburg-like remodeling is required for HeLa cells to maintain ATP levels and survive under hyperosmotic conditions.

We show that the optimal control of reliability and robustness required to minimize septum positioning error is achieved by the wild-type (WT).

We found that primary keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) cultured with the ROCKi Y-27632 for six days exhibited rapid proliferation while maintaining the ability to differentiate. Importantly, after discontinuation of ROCKi treatment, KSC numbers and characteristics were indistinguishable from those in non-treated cultures. We further confirmed that ROCKi treatment resulted in the activation of AKT and ERK pathways, which could support cell survival and proliferation in keratinocytes. We thus concluded that accelerating keratinocyte expansion with short-term ROCKi treatment does not exhaust KSCs self-renewal and differentiation capacities, presenting a safe avenue for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Gametogenesis requires packaging of the cellular components needed for the next generation. In budding yeast, this process includes degradation of many mitotically stable proteins, followed by their resynthesis. Here, we show that one such case--Superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), a protein that commonly aggregates in human ALS patients--is regulated by an integrated set of events, beginning with the formation of pre-meiotic Sod1 aggregates. This is followed by degradation of a subset of the prior Sod1 pool and clearance of Sod1 aggregates. As degradation progresses, Sod1 protein production is transiently blocked during mid-meiotic stages by transcription of an extended and poorly translated SOD1 mRNA isoform, SOD1LUTI. Expression of SOD1LUTI is induced by the Unfolded Protein Response, and it acts to repress canonical SOD1 mRNA expression. SOD1LUTI is no longer expressed following the meiotic divisions, enabling a resurgence of canonical mRNA and synthesis of new Sod1 protein such that gametes inherit a full complement of this important enzyme that is essential for gamete viability. Altogether, this work reveals meiosis to be an unusual cellular context in which Sod1 levels are tightly regulated. Our findings also suggest that further investigation of Sod1 during yeast gametogenesis could shed light on conserved aspects of its aggregation and degradation that could have implications for our understanding of human disease.",

    "abstract": "During early development, cartilage provides shape and stability to the embryo while serving as a precursor for the skeleton. Correct formation of embryonic cartilage is hence essential for healthy development. In vertebrate cranial cartilage, it has been observed that a flat and laterally extended macroscopic geometry is linked to regular microscopic structure consisting of tightly packed, short, transversal clonar columns. However, it remains an ongoing challenge to identify how individual cells coordinate to successfully shape the tissue, and more precisely which mechanical interactions and cell behaviors contribute to the generation and maintenance of this columnar cartilage geometry during embryogenesis. Here, we apply a three-dimensional cell-based computational model to investigate mechanical principles contributing to column formation. The model accounts for clonal expansion, anisotropic proliferation and the geometrical arrangement of progenitor cells in space. We confirm that oriented cell divisions and repulsive mechanical interactions between cells are key drivers of column formation. In addition, the model suggests that column formation benefits from the spatial gaps created by the extracellular matrix in the initial configuration, and that column maintenance is facilitated by sequential proliferative phases. Our model thus correctly predicts the dependence of local order on division orientation and tissue thickness. The present study presents the first cell-based simulations of cell mechanics during cranial cartilage formation and we anticipate that it will be useful in future studies on the formation and growth of other cartilage geometries.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn embryos, the initial skeleton is made out of cartilage. As the embryo grows, this cartilage needs to increase in size while correctly maintaining shape. A recent study revealed that for cartilage found in growing skulls, a flat sheet-like geometry is reflected in a distinct arrangement of cells at the microscopic level. Cells sharing a common ancestor are arranged into short columns such that the sheet grows in thickness by lengthening columns, and expands length-wise by adding new columns from single precursor cells. In this work we investigate the mechanical principles underlying column formation and insertion using a computational model that individually represents cells and their behavior. We confirm that arrangement of clonal columns perpendicular to the main expansion direction of the sheet requires oriented cell division. Moreover, we find that column order benefits from an increased amount of extracellular matrix between cells. Similarly, our model suggests that new clonal columns are able to insert themselves into pre-existing cartilage if sufficient matrix is available. Our model constitutes an important step to study cartilage formation and growth in different geometries which will be useful for understanding skeletal developmental disorders as well as for applications in tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "We find that in regenerative erythropoiesis, the erythroid progenitor landscape is reshaped, and a previously undescribed progenitor population with CFU-E activity (stress CFU-E/sCFU-E) is markedly expanded to restore the erythron. sCFU-E are targets of erythropoietin (Epo) and sCFU-E expansion requires signaling from the Epo receptor (EpoR) cytoplasmic tyrosines. Molecularly, Epo promotes sCFU-E expansion via JAK2/STAT5-dependent expression of IRS2, thus engaging the pro-growth signaling from the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). Inhibition of IGF1R/IRS2 signaling impairs sCFU-E cell growth, whereas exogenous IRS2 expression rescues cell growth in sCFU-E expressing truncated EpoR lacking cytoplasmic tyrosines. This sCFU-E pathway is the major pathway involved in erythrocytosis driven by the oncogenic JAK2 mutant, JAK2(V617F), in myeloproliferative neoplasm. Inability to expand sCFU-E cells by truncated EpoR protects against JAK2(V617F)-driven erythrocytosis. In myeloproliferative neoplasm patient samples, the number of sCFU-E like cells increases, and inhibition of IGR1R/IRS2 signaling blocks Epo-hypersensitive erythroid cell colony formation. In summary, we identify a new stress-specific erythroid progenitor cell population that links regenerative erythropoiesis to pathogenic erythrocytosis.\n\nKey PointsO_LIEpo-induced IRS2 allows engagement of IGF1R signaling to expand a previously unrecognized progenitor population in erythropoietic stress.\nC_LIO_LITruncated EpoR does not support stress CFU-E expansion and protects against JAK2(V617F)-driven erythrocytosis in MPN.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Apical extracellular matrices (aECMs) are associated with all epithelia and form a protective layer against biotic and abiotic threats in the environment. C. elegans molting offers a powerful entry point to understanding developmentally programmed aECM remodeling. Several protease inhibitors are implicated in molting, but their functions remain poorly understood. Here we characterize mlt-11, an unusual protease inhibitor with 10 conserved Kunitz domains. MLT-11 oscillates and is localized in the cuticle and in lysosomes in larvae and in the embryonic sheath starting at the 3-fold embryo stage. mlt-11 (RNAi) produced a developmental delay, motility defects, failed apolysis, and a defective cuticle barrier. mlt-11 null and C-terminal Kunitz domain deletion mutants are embryonic lethal while N-terminal deletions cause a rolling phenotype indicative of cuticle structure abnormalities. mlt-11 activity is primarily necessary in seam and hypodermal cells and accordingly mlt-11 (RNAi) causes defects in localization of the collagens ROL-6 and BLI-1 over the cuticle. mlt-11 (RNAi) molting phenotypes can be suppressed by genetically inhibiting endocytosis. Our model is that MLT-11 is acting in the aECM to coordinate remodeling and timely ecdysis.",

    "abstract": "The exact mechanism controlling cell growth remains a grand challenge in developmental biology and regenerative medicine. The Drosophila wing disc tissue serves as an ideal biological model to study growth regulation due to similar features observed in other developmental systems. The mechanism of growth regulation in the wing disc remains a subject of intense debate. Most existing models to study tissue growth focus on either chemical signals or mechanical forces only. Here we developed a multiscale chemical-mechanical coupled model to test a growth regulation mechanism depending on the spatial range of the morphogen gradient. By comparing the spatial distribution of cell division and the overall shape of tissue obtained in the coupled model with experimental data, our results show that the distribution of the Dpp morphogen can be critical in resulting tissue size and shape. A larger tissue size with a faster growth rate and more symmetric shape can be achieved if the Dpp gradient spreads in a larger domain. Together with the absorbing boundary conditions, the feedback regulation that downregulates Dpp receptors on the cell membrane allows the further spread of the morphogen away from its source region, resulting in prolonged tissue growth at a more spatially homogeneous growth rate.\n\nSummary StatementA multiscale chemical-mechanical model was developed by coupling submodels representing dynamics of a morphogen gradient at the tissue level, intracellular chemical signals, and mechanical properties at the subcellular level. By applying this model to study the Drosophila wing disc, it was found that the spatial range of the morphogen gradient affected tissue growth in terms of the growth rate and the overall shape.",

    "abstract": "The balance of contralateral and ipsilateral retinogeniculate projections is critical for the establishment of binocular vision, but the transcriptional programs regulating this process remain ill-defined. In this study, we show that the Pou class homeobox protein POU3F1 is selectively expressed in developing mouse contralateral retinal ganglion cells (cRGCs). Inactivation of Pou3f1 increases the number of ipsilateral RGCs produced, leading to abnormal ipsilateral to contralateral projection ratio at the optic chiasm, whereas expression of Pou3f1 in retinal progenitors increases the production of cRGCs. Using Cut&Run and RNA sequencing in wildtype and Pou3f1 mouse knockout retinas, we demonstrate that Pou3f1 is necessary for the establishment of a cRGC gene regulatory network through activation and repression of several known contralateral and ipsilateral determinants, respectively. Finally, we report that POU3F1 is sufficient to induce production of RGC-like cells sending projections to the optic nerve, even in late-stage retinal progenitors not normally competent to generate RGCs. This work uncovers POU3F1 as a master regulator of the cRGC transcriptional program and opens new possibilities for optic nerve regenerative therapies.",

Here, we combined 3D imaging and proteomics with murine models in which muscle contractility and patterning are disrupted to resolve morphological and compositional changes in the ECM during MTJ development. We found that MTJ-specific ECM deposition can be initiated via static loading due to growth; however, it required cyclic loading to develop a mature morphology. Furthermore, the MTJ can mature without the tendon terminating into cartilage. Based on these results, we describe a model wherein MTJ development depends on mechanical loading but not insertion into an enthesis.",

    "abstract": "The origin and differentiation mechanism of articular chondrocytes remain poorly understood. Broadly, the difference in developmental mechanisms of articular and growth-plate cartilage is still less elucidated. Here, we identified that the nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) is a crucial regulator of articular, but not growth-plate, chondrocyte differentiation during development. At the early stage of mouse knee development (embryonic day 13.5), NFATc1-expressing cells were mainly located in the flanking region of the joint interzone. With development, NFATc1-expressing cells generated almost all articular chondrocytes, but not chondrocytes in limb growth-plate primordium. NFATc1-expressing cells displayed prominent capacities for colony formation and multipotent differentiation. Transcriptome analyses revealed a set of characteristic genes in NFATc1-enriched articular cartilage progenitors. Strikingly, the expression of NFATc1 was diminished with articular chondrocyte differentiation, and suppressing NFATc1 expression in articular cartilage progenitors was sufficient to induce spontaneous chondrogenesis while overexpressing NFATc1 suppresses chondrogenesis. Mechanistically, NFATc1 negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of the Col2a1 gene. Thus, our results reveal that NFATc1 characterizes articular, but not growth-plate, cartilage progenitors and negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation at least partly through regulating COL2A1 gene transcription.",

However, the regulation and functional significance of various types of glycosylation at cellular levels is hard to unravel experimentally. Multi-omics, single-cell measurements such as SUGAR-seq, which quantifies transcriptomes and cell surface glycans, facilitate addressing this issue. Using SUGAR-seq data, we pioneered a deep learning model to predict the glycan phenotypes of cells (mouse T lymphocytes) from transcripts, with the example of predicting {beta}1,6GlcNAc-branching across T cell subtypes (test set F1 score: 0.9351). Model interpretation via SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) identified highly predictive genes, in part known to impact (i) branched glycan levels and (ii) the biology of branched glycans. These genes included physiologically relevant low-abundance genes that were not captured by conventional differential expression analysis. Our work shows that interpretable deep learning models are promising for uncovering novel functions and regulatory mechanisms of glycans from integrated transcriptomic and glycomic datasets.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian pineal gland (PG), cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) participates in the nocturnal melatonin synthesis that rhythmically modulates physiology and behavior. Phosphorylation of CREB1 present in pinealocyte nuclei is one of the key regulatory steps that drives pineal transcription. The spatio-temporal dynamics of CREB1 itself within PG cell types have not yet been documented. In this study we analyzed total CREB1 via Western blot, and the dynamism of CREB1 nuclear distribution in individual rat pinealocytes using fluorescence immunohistochemistry followed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy and quantitative analysis. Total CREB1 levels remained constant in the PG throughout the light:dark cycle. The distribution pattern of nuclear CREB1 did vary, however, among different PG cells. Pinealocytes emerged as having discrete CREB1 domains within their nucleoplasm that were especially distinct. The number, size, and location of CREB1 foci fluctuated among pinealocytes, within the same PG and among Zeitgeber times. A significantly larger dispersion of CREB1-immunoreactive nuclear sites was found at night. This was not accompanied by changes in the overall transcription activity, which was mostly conserved between the light and dark phases, as shown by the expression of a particular phosphorylated form of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII-pSer5CTD). Suppression of the nocturnal norepinephrine pulse by chronic bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy increased CREB1 dispersion in pinealocyte nuclei, as compared to sham-derived cells. In addition, differences in CREB1 distribution were found between sham-operated and non-operated rats at early night. Together, these data suggest that in mature pinealocytes nuclear CREB1 is subjected to a dynamic spatio-temporal distribution. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, including the role of chromatin and interchromatin elements, and to understand the impact of CREB1 reorganization in the pineal transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "The speed-curvature power law is one of the most studied constraints in biological movement. In many types of movements, there is a strong relationship between instantaneous speed and local curvature. For example, in elliptical trajectories, tangential speed is proportional to curvature raised to the power -1/3, (V[~]C-1/3). This phenomenon is known as the \"one-thirds power law\" and is generally considered to be mathematically equivalent to the \"two-thirds power law\" that describes the relationship between angular speed and curvature (A[~]C2/3); the two formulations are used interchangeably. However, in this paper, analysis of empirical and synthetic data demonstrates that using angular speed instead of tangential speed to estimate the power law tends to result in much stronger correlations, impacting the interpretation of the strength of the relationship, and therefore the existence of the law. Further analysis shows that angular speed and curvature are often trivially correlated, since angular speed is not a purely kinematic variable and depends on curvature. In conclusion, two forms of the law are not equivalent, angular speed should be avoided when expressing the speed-curvature power law.",

    "abstract": "How the human brain supports speech comprehension is an important question in neuroscience. Studying the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying human language is not only critical to understand and develop treatments for many human conditions that impair language and communication but also to inform artificial systems that aim to automatically process and identify natural speech. In recent years, intelligent machines powered by deep learning have achieved near human level of performance in speech recognition. The fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience have finally reached a similar phenotypical level despite of their huge differences in implementation, and so deep learning models can--in principle--serve as candidates for mechanistic models of the human auditory system. Utilizing high-performance automatic speech recognition systems, and advanced noninvasive human neuroimaging technology such as magnetoencephalography and multivariate pattern-information analysis, the current study aimed to relate machine-learned representations of speech to recorded human brain representations of the same speech. In one direction, we found a quasi-hierarchical functional organisation in human auditory cortex qualitatively matched with the hidden layers of deep neural networks trained in an automatic speech recognizer. In the reverse direction, we modified the hidden layer organization of the artificial neural network based on neural activation patterns in human brains. The result was a substantial improvement in word recognition accuracy and learned speech representations. We have demonstrated that artificial and brain neural networks can be mutually informative in the domain of speech recognition.\n\nAuthor summaryThe human capacity to recognize individual words from the sound of speech is a cornerstone of our ability to communicate with one another, yet the processes and representations underlying it remain largely unknown. Software systems for automatic speech-to-text provide a plausible model for how speech recognition can be performed. In this study, we used an automatic speech recogniser model to probe recordings from the brains of participants who listened to speech. We found that the parts of the dynamic, evolving representations inside the machine system were a good fit for representations found in the brain recordings, both showing similar hierarchical organisations. Then, we observed where the machines representations diverged from the brains, and made experimental adjustments to the automatic recognizers design so that its representations might better fit the brains. In so doing, we substantially improved the recognizers ability to accurately identify words.",

Here we report that the MPXVs that cause outbreak-2022 (MPXVs-2022) have deletion/insertion of [~]500 to 2000bp nucleotide in multiple genomic regions. Our analyses revealed that MPXVs-2022 are very close to the West African Clade of MPXVs (WA-MPXVs) that caused the Outbreak in Nigeria in 2017-2018. Furthermore, we classified the WA-MPXVs detected before 2017 that could not be transmitted from human-to-human as WA-MPXVs-I and WA-MPXVs detected after 2017 that could be transmitted from human-to-human as WA-MPXVs-II (including MPXVs-2022), and human-to-human transmissible Central African MPXVs (CA-MPXV) remained as a separate clade. Overall our results suggest that although WA-MPXVs-II are almost identical to WA-MPXVs-I throughout the genome and two large genomic insertions ([~]500, 2000bp size insertion), they differ from WA-MPXVs-I in 5-inverted terminal repeat (5-ITR) (deletion of the last-2000bp-5-ITR) and 13 proteins that of CA-MPXVs, and the presence of seven unique proteins in WA-MPXVs-II is likely to be a significant cause of outbreak-2022.

Although naturally occurring OxBC is consumed in foods and feeds, a direct demonstration here of safety of synthetic OxBC supports its increasing usage. A toxicological study in rats showed a maximum tolerated single oral dose, an LD50, and a NOAEL of 5,000, 30,079 and 1875 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The repeat-dose 90-day oral toxicity study showed no adverse physiological or pathological effects. A first study of OxBC uptake by mice over 2-5 days into a select set of tissues showed OxBC already was naturally present. The highest levels were in liver, lung, and hamstring. Despite dosing, no net increases occurred in liver, kidney, lung, and muscle. Net increases occurred in urine, intestinal content, plasma, feces, spleen, and cecum, consistent with processing of OxBC and preferential elimination of polymer. Compared to the 4:1 polymer: apocarotenoid ratio of OxBC, polymer was enriched in liver and spleen and depleted in lung, kidney, hamstring, and abdominal muscle. The apparent control of OxBC in major tissues further supports its safety.",

    "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a global health care challenge and a major cause of liver disease. To find new therapeutic avenues with a potential to functionally cure chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, we performed a focused screen of epigenetic modifiers to identify replication inhibitors. From this work we identified isonicotinic acid inhibitors of the histone lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) with potent anti-HBV activity. To enhance the cellular permeability and liver accumulation of the most potent KDM5 inhibitor identified (GS-080) an ester prodrug was developed (GS-5801) that resulted in improved bioavailability and liver exposure as well as an increased H3K4me3:H3 ratio on chromatin. GS-5801 treatment of HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes inhibited HBV replication and antigen levels. Evaluation of GS-5801 antiviral activity in a humanized mouse model of HBV infection, however, did not result in antiviral efficacy, despite achieving pharmacodynamic levels of H3K4me3:H3 predicted to be efficacious from the in vitro model. Here we discuss potential reasons for the disconnect between in vitro and in vivo efficacy, which highlight the translational difficulties of epigenetic targets for viral diseases.",

    "abstract": "One challenge in neuroscience is to understand how information flows between neurons in vivo to trigger specific behaviors. Granger causality (GC) has been proposed as a simple and effective measure for identifying dynamical interactions. At single-cell resolution however, GC analysis is rarely used compared to directionless correlation analysis. Here, we study the applicability of GC analysis for calcium imaging data in diverse contexts. We first show that despite underlying linearity assumptions, GC analysis successfully retrieves non-linear interactions in a synthetic network simulating intracellular calcium fluctuations of spiking neurons. We highlight the potential pitfalls of applying GC analysis on real in vivo calcium signals, and offer solutions regarding the choice of GC analysis parameters. We took advantage of calcium imaging datasets from motoneurons in embryonic zebrafish to show how the improved GC can retrieve true underlying information flow. Applied to the network of brainstem neurons of larval zebrafish, our pipeline reveals strong driver neurons in the locus of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), driving target neurons matching expectations from anatomical and physiological studies. Altogether, this practical toolbox can be applied on in vivo population calcium signals to increase the selectivity of GC to infer flow of information across neurons.",

    "abstract": "Hypothalamic vasopressin neurons are neuroendocrine cells which form part of the homeostatic systems that maintain osmotic pressure. In response to synaptic inputs encoding osmotic pressure and changes in plasma volume, they generate spike triggered secretion of peptide hormone vasopressin from axonal terminals in the posterior pituitary. The thousands of neurons secretory signals generate a summed plasma vasopressin signal acting at the kidneys to regulate water loss. Vasopressin is synthesised in cell bodies, packaged into vesicles, and transported to large stores in the pituitary terminals. Supported by activity-dependent upregulation of synthesis and transport, these stores can maintain a secretion response for several days of elevated osmotic pressure, tested by dehydration or salt loading. However, despite upregulated synthesis, stores gradually decline during sustained challenge, followed by a slow recovery. With no evidence of a store encoding feedback signal, previous modelling explained these synthesis dynamics based on activity-dependent upregulation of transcription and mRNA content. Here this model is adapted and integrated into our existing spiking and secretion model to generate a neuronal population model, able to simulate the secretion, store depletion, and replenishment, response to sustained osmotic challenge, matching the dynamics observed experimentally and making functional predictions for the cell body mechanisms.",

These differences result in Kymice having CDRH3 length and diversity intermediate between mice and humans. To compare the structural space explored by CDRH3s in each species repertoire, we used computational structure prediction to show that Kymouse naive BCR repertoires are more human-like than mouse-like in their predicted distribution of CDRH3 shape.

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence links zoonotic disease risk, including pandemic threats, to biodiversity loss and other upstream anthropogenic impacts on ecosystem health. However, there is little current research assessing viral diversity in endangered species. Here, combining IUCN Red List data on 5,876 mammal species with data on host-virus associations for a subset of 1,273 extant species, we examine the relationship between endangered species status and viral diversity, including the subset of viruses that can infect humans (zoonotic viruses). We show that fewer total viruses and fewer zoonotic viruses are known to infect more threatened species. After correcting for sampling effort, zoonotic virus diversity is mostly independent of threat status, but endangered species--despite a higher apparent research effort--have a significantly lower diversity of viruses, a property that is not explained by collinearity with host phylogeography or life history variation. Although this pattern could be generated by real biological processes, we suspect instead that endangered species may be subject to additional sampling biases not captured by the total volume of scientific literature (e.g., lower rates of invasive sampling may decrease viral discovery). Overall, our findings suggest that endangered species are no more or less likely to host viruses that pose a threat to humans, but future zoonotic threats might remain undiscovered in these species. This may be concerning, given that drivers of endangered species vulnerability such as habitat disturbance, wildlife trade, or climate vulnerability may increase virus prevalence in reservoirs and risk of spillover into humans.",

The extent to which this process affects belowground biota is a critical issue because soil organisms play a key role in ecosystem functioning and maintenance. However, the magnitude of the reshuffling of soil species remains unknown so far because of the lack of a historic baseline. Here, we begin to fill this gap with the largest spatiotemporal database of native and alien earthworms in North America. Our results reveal that the entire continent is being invaded by non-native earthworms through a variety of pathways. We show that these aliens bring novel ecological functions in most regions and thus represent a major threat to native ecosystems. Our findings demonstrate that earthworms, and most likely other soil organisms, represent a major but overlooked pool of invasive species with strong ecological impact.

    "abstract": "The diversity of microbial insertion sequences, crucial mobile genetic elements in generating diversity in microbial genomes, needs to be better represented in current microbial databases. Identification of these sequences in microbiome communities presents some significant problems that have led to their underrepresentation. Here, we present a bioinformatics pipeline called Palidis that recognises insertion sequences in metagenomic sequence data rapidly by identifying inverted terminal repeat regions from mixed microbial community genomes. Applying Palidis to 264 human metagenomes identifies 879 unique insertion sequences, with 519 being novel and not previously characterised. Querying this catalogue against a large database of isolate genomes reveals evidence of horizontal gene transfer events across bacterial classes. We will continue to apply this tool more widely, building the Insertion Sequence Catalogue, a valuable resource for researchers wishing to query their microbial genomes for insertion sequences.\n\nData SummaryO_LIPalidis is available here: github.com/blue-moon22/palidis\nC_LIO_LIThe Insertion Sequence Catalogue is available to download here: https://github.com/blue-moon22/ISC\nC_LIO_LIThe raw reads from the Human Microbiome Project can be retrieved using the download links provided in Supplementary Data 1\nC_LIO_LIThe analysis for this paper is available here: github.com/blue-moon22/palidis_paper_analysis\nC_LIO_LIThe output of Palidis that was run on these reads is available in Supplementary Data 2\nC_LI\n\nImpact StatementInsertion sequences are a class of transposable element that play an important role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes. However, it is challenging to completely characterise the transmission dynamics of insertion sequences and their precise contribution to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The main reasons for this are that it is impossible to identify all insertion sequences based on limited reference databases and that de novo computational methods are ill-equipped to make fast or accurate predictions based on incomplete genomic assemblies. Palidis generates a larger, more comprehensive catalogue of insertion sequences based on a fast algorithm harnessing genomic diversity in mixed microbial communities. This catalogue will enable genomic epidemiologists and researchers to annotate genomes for insertion sequences more extensively and advance knowledge of how insertion sequences contribute to bacterial evolution in general and antimicrobial resistance spread across microbial lineages in particular. This will be useful for genomic surveillance, and for development of microbiome engineering strategies targeting inactivation or removal of important transposable elements carrying antimicrobial resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "Emotional contagion refers to the transmission of emotions from one conspecific to another. Previous research in rodents has demonstrated that the self-experience of footshocks enhances how much an observer is affected by the emotional state of a conspecific in pain or distress. We hypothesized auditory auto-conditioning to contribute to this enhancement: during the observers own experience of shocks, the animal associates its own audible nocifensive responses, i.e. its pain squeaks, with the negative affective state induced by the shock. When the animal later witnesses a cage mate receive shocks and hears it squeak, the previously strengthened connection between fear and squeaks could be a mechanism eliciting the enhanced fearful response in the observer. As hypothesized, in a first study, we found pre-exposure to shocks to increase freezing and 22 kHz vocalizations associated with distress upon the playback of pain squeaks. Freezing was also increased during the playbacks of phase-scrambled squeaks, but 22 kHz calls were more frequent during the playback of regular squeaks. Core to the notion of auto-conditioning is that the effect of pre-exposure is due to the pairing of a pain-state with hearing ones own pain squeaks. In a second study, we therefore compared the response to squeak playbacks after animals had been pre-exposed to pairings of a CO2 laser with a squeak playback against three control groups that were pre-exposed to the CO2 laser alone, to squeak playbacks alone or to neither of these conditions. We however could not find any differences in freezing or 22 kHz calls among all experimental groups. In summary, we demonstrate the sufficiency of pain squeaks to trigger fear in a way that critically depends on the nature of an animals prior experience and discuss why the pairing of a CO2 laser with pain squeaks cannot substitute footshock pre-exposure.",

FLT3-ITDs are increasingly screened through high-throughput sequencing (HTS) raising the need for robust and efficient algorithms. We developed a new algorithm, which performs no alignment and uses little resources, to identify and quantify FLT3-ITDs in HTS data.\n\nResultsOur algorithm (FiLT3r) focuses on the k-mers from reads covering FLT3 exons 14 and 15. We show that those k-mers bring enough information to accurately detect, determine the length and quantify FLT3-ITD duplications. We compare the performances of FiLT3r to state-of-the-art alternatives and to fragment analysis, the gold standard method, on a cohort of 185 AML patients sequenced with capture-based HTS. On this dataset FiLT3r is more precise (no false positive nor false negative) than the other software evaluated. We also assess the software on public RNA-Seq data, which confirms the previous results and shows that FiLT3r requires little resources compared to other software.\n\nConclusionFiLT3r is a free software available at https://gitlab.univ-lille.fr/filt3r/filt3r.

Compared to epithelial carcinomas, however, the impact of fibrillar collagens on malignant mesenchymal tumours, including uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS), remains elusive. In this study, we analyse the network morphology and density of fibrillar collagens combined with the gene expression of LMS, LM and normal myometrium (MM). We find that, in contrast to LM, LMS tumours present low collagen density and increased expression of collagen-remodelling genes, features associated with tumour aggressiveness. Using collagen-based 3D matrices, we show that the activity of MMP14, a central protein with collagen-remodelling functions particularly overexpressed in LMS, is necessary for LMS cell proliferation. In addition, we find that, unlike MM and LM cells, LMS proliferation and migration are not affected by collagen substrate stiffness. We demonstrate that LMS cell growth in low matrix adhesion microenvironments is supported by an enhanced basal YAP activity. Altogether, our results indicate that LMS cells acquire high collagen remodelling capabilities and are adapted to grow and migrate in low collagen and soft microenvironments. These results further suggest that matrix remodelling and YAP are potential therapeutic targets for this deadly disease.",

ERK1/2 ectopic activation is responsible for various types of cancer, especially drug resistance to inhibitors of RTK, RAF and MEK, but specific ERK1/2 inhibitors are scarce. In this study, we identified a potential novel ERK covalent inhibitor, Laxiflorin B, a herbal compound with anticancer activity. However, Laxiflorin B is present at low levels in herbs; therefore, we adopted a semi-synthetic process for the efficient production of Laxiflorin B to improve the yield. Laxiflorin B induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis via BAD activation in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, especially in EGFR mutant subtypes. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that Laxiflorin B inhibits amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) expression through ERK inhibition, and suppressed the activation of their receptors, ErbBs, via a positive feedback loop. More importantly, mass spectrometry combined with computer simulation analysis revealed that Laxiflorin B binds covalently to Cys-183 in the ATP-binding pocket of ERK1 through D-ring, and Cys-178 of ERK1 though non-inhibitory binding of A-ring, respectively. Laxiflorin B also exhibited strong tumor suppressive effects with low toxicity in a NSCLC tumor xenograft model in nude mice, and AREG and EREG were identified as biomarkers of Laxiflorin B efficacy. Finally, Laxiflorin B-4, a C-6 modification of Laxiflorin B, exhibited higher affinity for ERK1/2 and stronger tumor suppression. These findings provide a new approach to tumor inhibition using natural anticancer compounds.",

    "abstract": "Based on quantitative cyto- and receptor architectonic analyses, we identified 35 prefrontal areas and introduced a novel subdivision of Walkers areas 10, 9, 8B and 46. Statistical analysis of receptor densities revealed regional differences in lateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Since structural and functional organization of subdivisions encompassing areas 46 and 12 demonstrated significant differences in the interareal levels of 2 receptors. Furthermore, multivariate analysis included receptor fingerprints of previously identified 16 motor areas in the same macaque brains, and revealed five clusters encompassing frontal lobe areas. Based on the functional connectivity analysis, clustered areas showed similar connectivity distribution pattern. In particular, rostrally located areas (in clusters 1-2) were characterized by bigger fingerprints, i.e., higher receptor densities, and stronger regional interconnections. Whereas, more caudal areas (in clusters 3-5) had smaller fingerprints, but showed a widespread connectivity pattern with distant cortical regions. Taken together, present study provides a comprehensive insight into the molecular structure underlying the functional organization of the cortex and, thus, reconcile discrepancies between the structural and functional hierarchical organization of the primate frontal lobe. Finally, our data are publicly available via the EBRAINS and BALSA repositories for the entire scientific community.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, containing vital populations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) distributed throughout the cell. Mitochondria form diverse physical structures in different cells, from cell-wide reticulated networks to fragmented individual organelles. These physical structures are known to influence the genetic makeup of mtDNA populations between cell divisions, but their influence on the inheritance of mtDNA at divisions remains less understood. Here, we use statistical and computational models of mtDNA content inside and outside the reticulated network to quantify how mitochondrial network structure can control the variances of inherited mtDNA copy number and mutant load. We assess the use of moment-based approximations to describe heteroplasmy variance and identify several cases where such an approach has shortcomings. We show that biased inclusion of one mtDNA type in the network can substantially increase heteroplasmy variance (acting as a genetic bottleneck), and controlled distribution of network mass and mtDNA through the cell can conversely reduce heteroplasmy variance below a binomial inheritance picture. Network structure also allows the generation of heteroplasmy variance while controlling copy number inheritance to sub-binomial levels, reconciling several observations from the experimental literature. Overall, different network structures and mtDNA arrangements within them can control the variances of key variables to suit a palette of different inheritance priorities.",

    "abstract": "In a cross between two homozygous Brassica napus plants of synthetic and natural origin, we demonstrate that novel structural genome variants from the synthetic parent cause immediate genome diversification among F1 offspring. Long read sequencing in twelve F1 sister plants revealed five large-scale structural rearrangements where both parents carried different homozygous alleles but the heterozygous F1 genomes were not identical heterozygotes as expected. Such spontaneous rearrangements were part of homoeologous exchanges or segmental deletions and were identified in different, individual F1 plants. The variants caused deletions, gene copy-number variations, diverging methylation patterns and other structural changes in large numbers of genes and may have been causal for unexpected phenotypic variation between individual F1 sister plants, for example strong divergence of plant height and leaf area. This example supports the hypothesis that spontaneous de novo structural rearrangements after de novo polyploidization can rapidly overcome intense allopolyploidization bottlenecks to re-expand crops genetic diversity for ecogeographical expansion and human selection. The findings imply that natural genome restructuring in allopolyploid plants from interspecific hybridization, a common approach in plant breeding, can have a considerably more drastic impact on genetic diversity in agricultural ecosystems than extremely precise, biotechnological genome modifications.",

However, due to our imperfect knowledge of metabolic processes, even highly curated GEMs have knowledge gaps (e.g., missing reactions). Existing gap-filling methods typically require phenotypic data as input to tease out missing reactions. We still lack a computational method for rapid and accurate gap-filling of metabolic networks before experimental data is available. Here we present a deep learning-based method -- CHEbyshev Spectral HyperlInk pREdictor (CHESHIRE) -- to predict missing reactions in GEMs purely from metabolic network topology. We demonstrate that CHESHIRE outperforms other topology-based methods in predicting artificially removed reactions over 926 high- and intermediate-quality GEMs. Furthermore, CHESHIRE is able to improve the phenotypic predictions of 49 draft GEMs for fermentation products and amino acids secretions. Both types of validation suggest that CHESHIRE is a powerful tool for GEM curation to reveal unknown links between reactions and observed metabolic phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated 116 clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni from Toyama, Japan, which were isolated from 2015 to 2019. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing were used for phenotypic and genotypic characterization to compare antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles and phylogenic linkage. The multilocus sequence typing approach identified 37 sequence types (STs) and 15 clonal complexes (CCs), including 7 novel STs, and the high frequency CCs were CC21 (27.7%), CC48 (10.9%), and CC354 (9.9%). Overall, 58.6% of the isolates were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics and 3.4% were resistant to three or more antibiotic classes. The AMR profiles and related resistant factors were as follows; fluoroquinolones (51.7%), mutation in QRDRs (GyrA T86I), tetracyclines (27.6%), acquisition of tet(O), ampicillin (5.2%), promoter mutation in blaOXA193, aminoglycosides (1.7%), acquisition of ant(6)-Ia and aph(3)-III, chloramphenicol (0.9%), acquisition of cat. The resistance factors of fosfomycin (1 strain), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (2 strain), and linezolid (1 strain) resistant isolates were unknown. The acquired resistance genes, tet(O), ant(6>)-Ia, aph(3)-III, and cat, were located on pTet family plasmids. Furthermore, three pTet family plasmids formed larger plasmids that incorporated additional genes such as the Type IV secretion system.\n\nA comparison of pTet family plasmids in Japan has not been reported, and these results imply that the diversity of pTet family plasmids has increased. The prevalence of ST4526, belonging to CC21, in Japan has been reported, and it was also the major ST type (10.9%) in this study, suggesting that the ST4526 prevalence continues in Japan.",

Further, we learned that c-di-AMP plays a role in the autoregulation of the disA promoter to limit intracellular c-di-AMP concentration. We also identified an alternate start codon within the disA gene which can lead to the synthesis of truncated DisA protein at times using an independent stress-inducible promoter.

    "abstract": "Competence is one of the most efficient bacterial evolutionary and adaptative strategies by synchronizing production of antibacterial compounds and integration of DNA released by dead cells. In most streptococci, this tactic is orchestrated by the ComRS system, a pheromone communication device providing a sharp time window of activation in which only part of the population is responsive. Understanding how this developmental process integrates multiple inputs to fine-tune the adequate response is a long-standing question. However, essential genes involved in the regulation of ComRS have been challenging to study. In this work, we built a conditional mutant library using CRISPR-interference and performed three complementary screens to investigate competence genetic regulation in the human commensal Streptococus salivarius. We show that initiation of competence increases upon cell-wall impairment, suggesting a connection between cell envelope stress and competence activation. Notably, we report a key role for StkP, a serine-threonine kinase known to regulate cell-wall homeostasis. We show that StkP controls competence by a mechanism that reacts to peptidoglycan fragments. Together, our data suggest a key cell-wall sensing mechanism coupling competence to cell envelope integrity.\n\nIMPORTANCESurvival of human commensal streptococci in the digestive tract requires efficient strategies which must be tightly and collectively controlled for responding to competitive pressure and drastic environmental changes. In this context, the autocrine signaling system ComRS controlling competence for natural transformation and predation in salivarius streptococci could be seen as a multi-input device integrating a variety of environmental stimuli. In this work, we revealed novel positive and negative competence modulators by using a genome-wide CRISPR- interference strategy. Notably, we highlighted an unexpected connection between bacterial envelope integrity and competence activation that involves several cell-wall sensors. Together, these results showcase how commensal streptococci can fine-tune the pheromone-based competence system by responding to multiple inputs affecting their physiological status in order to calibrate an appropriate collective behavior.",

This complexity underlies the incomplete understanding of the genetic architecture of congenital heart diseases (CHDs). To define the multi-cellular epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of cardiac cellular development, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility maps of human fetal heart tissues. We identified eight major differentiation trajectories involving primary cardiac cell types, each associated with dynamic transcription factor (TF) activity signatures. We identified similarities and differences of regulatory landscapes of iPSC-derived cardiac cell types and their in vivo counterparts. We interpreted deep learning models that predict cell-type resolved, base-resolution chromatin accessibility profiles from DNA sequence to decipher underlying TF motif lexicons and infer the regulatory impact of non-coding variants. De novo mutations predicted to affect chromatin accessibility in arterial endothelium were enriched in CHD cases versus controls. We used CRISPR-based perturbations to validate an enhancer harboring a nominated regulatory CHD mutation, linking it to effects on the expression of a known CHD gene JARID2. Together, this work defines the cell-type resolved cis-regulatory sequence determinants of heart development and identifies disruption of cell type-specific regulatory elements as a component of the genetic etiology of CHD.",

    "abstract": "Kyasanur forest disease is a neglected zoonotic disease caused by a single-stranded RNA-based flavivirus, the incidence of which was first recorded in 1957 in the Southern part of India. Kyasanur forest disease virus is transmitted to monkeys and humans through the infected tick bite of Haemophysalis spinigera. Kyasanur forest disease is a febrile illness, which in severe cases, results in neurological complications leading to mortality. The current treatment regimens are symptomatic and supportive, and no targeted therapies are available for this disease. In this study, we evaluated the ability of FDA-approved drugs sofosbuvir (and its active metabolite) and Dasabuvir to inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of NS5 protein from the Kyasanur forest disease virus. NS5 protein containing the N-terminal methyl transferase domain and C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain was expressed in Escherichia coli, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was demonstrated with the purified protein. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assay conditions were optimized, followed by the determination of apparent Km,ATP to validate the enzyme preparation. Half maximal-inhibitory concentrations against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity were determined for Sofosbuvir and its active metabolite. Dasabuvir did not show detectable inhibition with the tested conditions. This is the first demonstration of the inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of NS5 protein from the Kyasanur forest disease virus with small molecule inhibitors. These initial findings can potentially facilitate the discovery and development of targeted therapies for treating Kyasanur forest disease.",

    "abstract": "Muscle mass and strength are predictors of longevity. We have previously identified a series of molecular brakes that slow muscle growth in response to stress. One potential stress that we hypothesized would limit muscle growth is caloric stress through the activation of SIRT1. We therefore identified natural product inhibitors of SIRT1 and tested their effects on load-induced increases in muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) using an incomplete factorial design. Supplying varying amounts of three natural products for the full two-week period of overload resulted in increases in fCSA that varied from -2 to 113%. Using these data, we produced a model that predicted the optimal combination and concentration of each natural product and validated this model in a separate cohort of animals. Following two weeks of overload, fCSA in the optimal group increased 62%, whereas in the placebo fCSA increased only 3%. The greater increase in fCSA was not the result of an increase in ribosomal mass. In fact, the optimal group showed significantly less of the 5 external transcribed spacer, a marker of 47S ribosomal RNA synthesis, and a trend for decreased total RNA. In spite of the lower ribosome mass, the increase in protein synthesis was similar, suggesting that the natural product cocktail may be increasing ribosomal efficiency rather than capacity. These data suggest that inhibition of SIRT1, together with exercise, may be useful in increasing muscle fCSA.",

    "abstract": "Electrical synapses are neuronal gap junction (GJ) channels associated with a macromolecular complex called the electrical synapse density (ESD), which regulates development and dynamically modifies electrical transmission. However, the proteomic makeup and molecular mechanisms utilized by the ESD that direct electrical synapse formation are not well understood. Using the Mauthner cell of zebrafish as a model, we previously found that the intracellular scaffolding protein ZO1b is a member of the ESD, localizing postsynaptically, where it is required for GJ channel localization, electrical communication, neural network function, and behavior. Here, we show that the complexity of the ESD is further diversified by the genomic structure of the ZO1b gene locus. The ZO1b gene is alternatively initiated at three transcriptional start sites resulting in isoforms with unique N-termini that we call ZO1b-Alpha, -Beta, and - Gamma. We demonstrate that ZO1b-Beta and ZO1b-Gamma are broadly expressed throughout the nervous system and localize to electrical synapses. By contrast, ZO1b-Alpha is expressed mainly non-neuronally and is not found at synapses. We generate mutants in all individual isoforms, as well as double mutant combinations in cis on individual chromosomes, and find that ZO1b-Beta is necessary and sufficient for robust GJ channel localization. ZO1b-Gamma, despite its localization to the synapse, plays an auxiliary role in channel localization. This study expands the notion of molecular complexity at the ESD, revealing that an individual genomic locus can contribute distinct isoforms to the macromolecular complex at electrical synapses. Further, independent scaffold isoforms have differential contributions to developmental assembly of the interneuronal GJ channels. We propose that ESD molecular complexity arises both from the diversity of unique genes and from distinct isoforms encoded by single genes. Overall, ESD proteomic diversity is expected to have critical impacts on the development, structure, function, and plasticity of electrical transmission.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is one of the top neglected tropical diseases with significant morbidity and mortality in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, this disease is also spreading in the developed world. Currently, there is a lack of effective strategies to control this disease. Vaccination can be an effective measure to control leishmaniasis and has the potential to achieve disease elimination. Recently, we have generated centrin gene-deleted new world L. mexicana (LmexCen-/-) parasites using CRISPR/Cas9 and showed that they protect mice against a homologous L. mexicana infection that causes cutaneous disease. In this study, we tested whether LmexCen-/- parasites can also protect against visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani in a hamster model. We show that immunization with LmexCen-/- parasites is safe and does not cause lesions. Furthermore, such immunization conferred protection against visceral leishmaniasis caused by a needle-initiated L. donovani challenge, as indicated by a significant reduction in the parasite burdens in the spleen and liver and lack of mortality. Similar control of parasite burden was also observed against a sand fly mediated L. donovani challenge. Importantly, immunization with LmexCen-/- down-regulated the Th2 response as indicated by a significant reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4 and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-{gamma} resulting in higher IFN-{gamma}/IL-10 and IFN-{gamma}/IL4 ratios compared to non-immunized animals. This contrasts with our studies with L. major centrin deletion mutants that showed a dominant Th1 response compared to L. major wild-type infection suggesting the divergent mechanisms of protection in the two mutant parasites. LmexCen-/- immunization resulted in long-lasting protection against L. donovani infection. Further, since the efficacy of LmCen-/- has not been determined against Leishmania strains prevalent in the Americas, LmexCen-/- may be a viable alternative. Taken together, our study demonstrates that immunization with LmexCen-/- parasites is safe and efficacious against old world visceral leishmaniasis.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection induces persistent influx of neutrophils that associates with poor bacterial control and clinical outcome from tuberculosis (TB). Although implicated in TB pathology, the mechanism by which these cells contribute to pathogenesis is poorly understood. Using Cell-DIVE multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging and spatial analysis of inflammatory TB lesions, we demonstrated that persistent neutrophil infiltration affects the spatiotemporal organization of T-lymphocytes and impairs their function. Instead of directly suppressing T-cells, neutrophils produce granulocyte colony stimulating factor (CSF3/G-CSF) that collaborates with type I interferon (IFN-I) to promote a granulocyte-skewed hematopoiesis impacting T-lymphocyte production. Importantly, neutrophil-intrinsic IFN-I receptor 1 (IFNAR1) is both necessary and sufficient to promote pathologic granulopoiesis. Finally, inhibition of IFNAR1-signaling alone mitigates immunopathogenesis by restoring hematopoietic equilibrium. Collectively, our work uncovers a potential immunevasion strategy by which virulent Mtb strains induce IFN-I to generate pathogen-permissive neutrophils that produce G-CSF and sustain pathogenic hematopoiesis to impair T-cell immunity during TB.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from any bacterial infection, causing 1.5 million deaths worldwide each year. Due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) there have been significant efforts aimed at developing novel drugs to treat TB. One promising drug target in Mtb is the arabinogalactan biosynthetic enzyme DprE1, and there have been over a dozen unique chemical scaffolds identified which inhibit the activity of this protein. Among the most promising lead compounds are the benzothiazinones BTZ043 and PBTZ169, both of which are currently in or have completed phase IIa clinical trials. Due to the potential clinical utility of these drugs, we sought to identify potential synergistic interactions and new mechanisms of resistance using a genome-scale CRISPRi chemical-genetic screen with PBTZ169. We found that knockdown of rv0678, the negative regulator of the mmpS5/L5 drug efflux pump, confers resistance to PBTZ169. Mutations in rv0678 are the most common form of resistance to bedaquiline and there is already abundant evidence of these mutations emerging in bedaquiline-treated patients. We confirmed that rv0678 mutations from clinical isolates confer low level cross-resistance to BTZ043 and PBTZ169. While it is yet unclear whether rv0678 mutations would render benzothiazinones ineffective in treating TB, these results highlight the importance of monitoring for clinically-prevalent rv0678 mutations during ongoing BTZ043 and PBTZ169 clinical trials.",

Conserved machineries and actors required to perform genetic transformation have been shown to accumulate at different cellular localizations depending on the model organism considered.\n\nHere, we show in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus that DNA binding, uptake and recombination are spatially and temporally coordinated to ensure S. aureus genetic transformation. We also reveal that localization of genetic transformation proteins is dynamic and preferentially occurs in the vicinity of the division septum. We finally propose that S. aureus competent cells would initiate and then block cell division to ensure the success of genetic transformation before the final constriction of the cytokinetic ring.",

    "abstract": "Chemotaxis is a widespread strategy used by unicellular and multicellular living organisms to maintain their fitness in stressful environments. We previously showed that bacteria can trigger a negative chemotactic response to a copper (Cu)-rich environment. Cu ions toxicity on bacterial cell physiology has been mainly linked to mismetallation events and ROS production, although the precise role of Cu-generated ROS remains largely debated.\n\nHere, we found that the cytoplasmic Cu ions content mirrors variations of the extracellular Cu ions concentration and triggers a dose-dependent oxidative stress, which can be abrogated by superoxide dismutase and catalase overexpression. The inhibition of ROS production in the cytoplasm not only improves bacterial growth but also impedes Cu-chemotaxis, indicating that ROS derived from cytoplasmic Cu ions mediate the control of bacterial chemotaxis to Cu.\n\nWe also identified the Cu chemoreceptor McpR, which binds Cu ions with low affinity, suggesting a labile interaction. In addition, we demonstrate that the cysteine 75 and histidine 99 within the McpR sensor domain are key residues in Cu chemotaxis and Cu coordination. Finally, we discovered that in vitro both Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions modulate McpR conformation in a distinct manner. Overall, our study provides mechanistic insights on a redox-based control of Cu chemotaxis, indicating that the cellular redox status can play a key role in bacterial chemotaxis.",

Here, we demonstrate that mouse CMV (MCMV), a {beta}-herpesvirus, persists for the long term and across organs in PDGFR+ fibroblastic cells, with similar or higher genome loads than in the previously known sites of MCMV latency. Whereas MCMV gene transcription in PDGFR+ fibroblastic cells was almost completely silenced at 5 months post-infection, these cells gave rise to reactivated virus ex vivo, arguing that they supported latent MCMV infection. Notably, PDGFR+ fibroblastic cells also supported productive virus replication during primary MCMV infection. Mechanistically, Stat1-deficiency resulted in increased lytic but abolished latent infection of fibroblastic cells in vivo. In sum, fibroblastic cells have a dual role as a site of lytic MCMV replication and a reservoir of latent MCMV in vivo and Stat1 is critically involved in the regulation of MCMV latency.",

    "abstract": "Kissing bugs (Hempitera: Reduviidae) are obligately and exclusively blood feeding insects. Vertebrate blood is thought to provide insufficient B vitamins to insects, which rely on obligate symbiotic relationships with bacteria that provision these nutrients. Kissing bugs harbor environmentally acquired bacteria in their gut lumen, without which they are unable to develop to adulthood. Early experiments identified a single bacterial species, Rhodococcus rhodnii, as a symbiont of Rhodnius prolixus, but modern studies of the kissing bug microbiome suggest that R. rhodnii is not always present or abundant in wild-caught individuals. We asked whether R. rhodnii or other bacteria alone could function as symbionts of R. prolixus. Bacteria-free (axenic) insects were produced whose microbiome could be experimentally manipulated to produce insects with known microbiomes (gnotobiotic). We found that gnotobiotic insects harboring R. rhodnii alone developed faster, had higher survival, and laid more eggs than gnotobiotic R. prolixus harboring other bacterial monocultures, including other described symbionts of kissing bugs and several related Rhodococcus species. R. rhodnii grew to high titer in the guts of R. prolixus while other tested species were found at much lower abundance. Rhodococcus species tested had nearly identical B vitamin biosynthesis genes, and dietary supplementation of B vitamins had a relatively minor effect on development and survival of gnotobiotic R. prolixus. Our results indicate that R. prolixus have a higher fitness when harboring R. rhodnii than other bacteria tested, and that symbiont B vitamin synthesis is likely a necessary but not sufficient function of gut bacteria in kissing bugs.",

    "abstract": "Many human pathogens need to extract lipids from their environment for survival and proliferation. How this is accomplished on a molecular level is largely unknown1. Here, we report a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the previously uncharacterized protein P116 (MPN_213) from Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a human pathogen responsible for approximately 30% of community-acquired human pneumonia2. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of P116 at 3.3 [A] resolution reveals a homodimer with a core domain presenting a previously unseen fold. This fold creates a large cavity of [~]18,000 [A]3 with a hydrophobic internal surface that is accessible to solvent. Within the cavity ligands with a length of 10-19 [A] and a width of 4 [A] could be observed. These ligands were identified as the essential lipids phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and cholesterol using mass spectrometry. When the cavity is emptied, the protein undergoes an extensive conformational change that can no longer accommodate lipids. When emptied P116 is incubated with high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) a net transfer of cholesterol is demonstrated by a radioactivity experiment and cryo-electron microscopy resolves a complex between P116 and HDL. Taken together, our results reveal the mechanism by which P116 extracts essential lipids from the host environment and possibly then delivers them into the membrane by a wringing movement. This mechanism may be precedential for other cholesterol-auxotrophic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing data (scRNAseq and snRNAseq, respectively) have revealed substantial heterogeneity in the AT (AT) cellular landscape in rodents and humans depending on depot and disease status. We used snRNAseq to characterize the cellular landscape of human visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous AT (SAT) samples from lean subjects and subjects with obesity. We identified multiple cell types in the AT cellular repertoire, including three major AT stromal cell (ASC) subpopulations, multiple types of adipocyte (ADIPO) populations that retain properties similar to ASC, endothelial cell (EC), T-cell, and macrophage (MAC) populations that are in concordance and expand upon other published datasets. ADIP and EC are more prominent in SAT compared to VAT which has a higher proportion of ASC. Of two dominant ASC subpopulations, one (inflammatory-mesothelial, IM- ASC) is present in VAT, but absent in SAT, while the other (fibroadipogenic, FA-ASC) is present in both VAT and SAT. Both populations retain their properties in in vitro culture and have adipogenic capacity with different metabolic features. Informatic and in situ studies support ADIP derived from IM- and FA- ASC are found in human VAT. We also identified a wide range of EC subtypes in human AT with features of lymphatic, venous, and arterial EC, with identification of a PRDM16 expression EC population with features of an EC progenitor. Immune cell populations match recent experimental validation of lipid activated macrophage (LAM) phenotypes, TIM4 macrophages, and a prominent population of MRC1/CD206+ resident AT macrophages with gene expression signatures related to glucocorticoid activation. Overall, our study demonstrates depot-specific cellular diversity in human VAT and SAT in which distinct ASC subpopulations may differently contribute to AT dysfunction in obesity. Also, our results highlight an unprecedented EC heterogeneity suggesting AT EC as highly specialized cells and potentially important regulators of depot-specific functions.\n\nMETHODS STATEMENTHuman subjects provided informed consent and were enrolled with approval from Institutional Review Boards at the University of Michigan and Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System.

    "abstract": "BackgroundColon cancer is often driven by mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, an essential tumor suppressor gene of the Wnt {beta}-catenin signaling pathway. APC and its interactions in the cytoplasm have been well studied, however various groups have also observed its presence in the nucleus. Identifying novel interactions of APC in the Wnt pathway will provide an opportunity to better understand the nuclear role of APC and ultimately identify potential cancer treatment targets.\n\nMethodsWe used the all-vs-all sequencing (AVA-Seq) method to interrogate the interactome of protein fragments spanning most of the 60 Wnt {beta}-catenin pathway proteins. Using protein fragments identified the interacting regions between the proteins with more resolution than a full-length protein approach. Pull-down assays were used to validate a subset of these interactions.\n\nResults74 known and 703 novel Wnt {beta}-catenin pathway protein-protein interactions were recovered in this study. There were 8 known and 31 novel APC protein-protein interactions. Novel interactions of APC and nuclear transcription factors TCF7, JUN, FOSL1, and SOX17 were particularly interesting and confirmed in validation assays.\n\nConclusionBased on our findings of novel interactions between APC and transcription factors and previous evidence of APC localizing to the nucleus, we suggest APC may compete and repress CTNNB1. This would occur through the binding of the transcription factors (JUN, FOSL1, TCF7) to regulate the Wnt signaling pathway including through enhanced marking of CTNNB1 for degradation in the nucleus by APC binding with SOX17. Additional novel Wnt {beta}-catenin pathway protein-protein interactions from this study could lead researchers to novel drug designs for cancer.",

Instead, m6A distribution is exclusion-based: m6A-consensus harboring sites are methylated by default, unless they are within a window of up to [~]200 nt from an exon-intron junction. A simple model, relying exclusively on presence of m6A motifs and exon-intron architecture allows high accuracy recapitulation of experimentally-measured m6A profiles and of all m6A hallmarks. We further establish that m6A serves as the long-sought mechanism underlying the strong association between exon-intron architecture and mRNA stability. Our findings establish a mechanism by which the memory of nuclear RNA splicing is covalently etched on an mRNA, in the form of m6A, and determines its cytoplasmic stability, with broad implications on the regulation, function, and evolution of both m6A and mRNA stability.",

Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) promotes AR signalling, in addition to established roles in cell cycle and global transcription regulation, together, providing a rationale for its therapeutic targeting in CRPC.\n\nMethodsThe antitumour activity of CT7001, an orally bioavailable CDK7 inhibitor, was investigated across CRPC models in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Cell-based assays and transcriptomic analyses of treated xenografts were employed to investigate the mechanism driving activity of CT7001, alone and in combination with the antiandrogen enzalutamide.\n\nResultsCT7001 selectively engages with CDK7 in prostate cancer cells, causing inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle arrest. Activation of p53, induction of apoptosis, and suppression of transcription mediated by full-length and constitutively active AR splice variants contribute to antitumour efficacy in vitro. Oral administration of CT7001 represses growth of CRPC xenografts and significantly augments growth inhibition achieved by enzalutamide. Transcriptome analyses of treated xenografts indicate cell cycle and AR inhibition as the mode of action of CT7001 in vivo.\n\nConclusionsThis study supports CDK7 inhibition as a strategy to target deregulated cell proliferation and demonstrates CT7001 is a promising CRPC therapeutic, alone or in combination with AR-targeting compounds.",

    "abstract": "TRIM proteins are the largest family of E3 ligases in mammals. They include the intracellular antibody receptor TRIM21, which is responsible for mediating targeted protein degradation during Trim-Away. Despite their importance, the ubiquitination mechanism of TRIM ligases has remained elusive. Here we show that while TRIM21 activation results in ubiquitination of both ligase and substrate, autoubiquitination is regulatory and not required for substrate degradation. Substrate binding stimulates N-terminal RING autoubiquitination by the E2 Ube2W, but when inhibited by N-terminal acetylation this prevents neither substrate ubiquitination nor degradation and has no impact on TRIM21 antiviral activity. Instead, uncoupling ligase and substrate degradation prevents ligase recycling and extends functional persistence in cells. Substrate ubiquitination mediates degradation but Trim-Away efficiently degrades lysine-less substrates, suggesting a non-canonical ubiquitination mechanism explains its broad substrate specificity.",

    "abstract": "Certain sacoglossan sea slugs can sequester and maintain photosynthetically active chloroplasts through algae feeding, a phenomenon called kleptoplasty. The period while these plastids remain active inside the slugs body is species- and environment-dependent and can span from a few days to more than three weeks. Here we report for the first time the transcriptome of sea slug Elysia viridis (Montagu, 1804), which can maintain kleptoplasts for more than two weeks and is distributed along all the Atlantic European coastline. The obtained transcriptome of E. viridis comprised 12,884 protein-coding sequences (CDS). The shortest one was 261bp, and the longest 8,766bp; the whole transcriptome has a total length of 9.3Mb (Table S4 and Fig. S2). Analysing these CDS, we identified 9,422 different proteins, with best hits mainly from two genera: Elysia (87.2%), and Plakobranchus (11.0%) (Fig. S2); the other 2.3% corresponded to multiple genera of sea slugs and snails (Tectipleura) (Kano et al., 2016). We got the functional annotation (Gene Ontologies, GO) corresponding to 9,333 CDS: 4,755 CDS associated with 2,583 Biological Process (BP); 5,466 CDS linked to 683 Cellular Components (CC); and 6,693 related to 1,606 Molecular Functions (MF). We identified 201 CDS related to response to stress (GO:0006950) and 10 CDS associated with the regulation of response to stress (GO:0080134). Focussing on the ROS-quenching toolkit, we found 24 CDS related to oxidoreductase complex (GO:1990204) and 560 annotated with oxidoreductase activity (GO:0016491) acting in a large number of donors, e.g., CH-OH, CH=O, C=O, CH and CH2. In addition, we found 39 CDS with antioxidant activity (GO:00162099) and other CDS with ROS-quenching function: superoxide dismutase (GO:0004784), peroxidase (GO:0004601), glutathione oxidoreductase (GO:0097573) and peroxidase (GO:0004602); and thioredoxin peroxidase (GO:0008379) activity. Furthermore, we found 8 CDS related to the symbiont response (GO:0140546) and nine related to the pattern recognition receptor signalling pathway (GO:0002221).",

    "abstract": "House mice (Mus musculus) are comprised of three primary subspecies. A large number of secondary subspecies have also been suggested on the basis of divergent morphology and molecular variation at limited numbers of markers. While the phylogenetic relationships among the primary M. musculus subspecies are well-defined, the relationships among the secondary subspecies, and their relationships to primary subspecies, remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate de novo genome sequencing of museum-stored specimens of house mice from one secondary subspecies (M. m. bactrianus) and publicly available genome sequences of house mice previously characterized as M. m. helgolandicus, with whole-genome sequences from diverse representatives of the three primary house mouse subspecies. We show that mice assigned to the secondary M. m. bactrianus and M. m. helgolandicus subspecies are not genetically differentiated from the contemporary M. m. castaneus and M. m. domesticus, respectively. Overall, our work suggests that the M. m. bactrianus and M. m. helgolandicus subspecies are not well-justified taxonomic entities, emphasizing the importance of leveraging whole-genome sequence data to inform subspecies designations. Additionally, our investigation has established experimental procedures for generating whole-genome sequences from air-dried museum specimens and provides key genomic resources to inform future genomic investigations of wild mouse diversity.",

    "abstract": "Gene-based association tests aggregate multiple SNP-trait associations into sets defined by gene boundaries. Since genes have a direct biological link to downstream function, gene-based test results are widely used in post-GWAS analysis. A common approach for gene-based tests is to combine SNPs associations by computing the sum of{chi} 2 statistics. However, this strategy ignores the directions of SNP effects, which could result in a loss of power for SNPs with masking effects (e.g., when the product of the effects of two SNPs and their linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlation is negative). Here, we introduce \"mBAT-combo\", a new set-based test that is better powered than other methods to detect multi-SNP associations in the context of masking effects. We validate the method through simulations and applications to real data. We find that of 35 blood and urine biomarker traits in the UK Biobank, 34 traits show evidence for masking effects in a total of 4,175 gene-trait pairs, indicating that masking effects in complex traits is common. We further validate the improved power of our method in height, body mass index and schizophrenia with different GWAS sample sizes and show that on average 95.7% of the genes detected only by mBAT-combo with smaller sample sizes can be identified by the single-SNP approach with larger sample sizes (average sample size increased by 1.7-fold). For instance, LRRC4B is significant only in our method for schizophrenia, which has been shown to play a role in presynaptic pathology using genetic fine-mapping and evidence-based synaptic annotations. As a more powerful gene-based method, mBAT-combo is expected to improve the downstream pathway analysis or tissue and cell-type enrichment analysis that takes genes identified from GWAS data as input to understand the biological mechanisms of the trait or disease. Despite our focus on genes in this study, the framework of mBAT-combo is general and can be applied to any set of SNPs to refine trait-association signals hidden in genomic regions with complex LD structures.",

    "abstract": "Precision genome-editing approaches have long been available in budding yeast, enabling introduction of gene deletions, epitope tag fusions, and promoter swaps through a selection-based strategy. Such approaches allow loci to be modified without disruption of coding or regulatory sequences of neighboring genes. Use of this approach to delete DBP1 however, led to silencing of expression and the resultant loss of function for the neighboring gene MRP51. We found that insertion of a resistance cassette to delete DBP1, drove a 5 extended alternative transcript for MRP51 which dampened Mrp51 protein synthesis. Misregulation of MRP51 occurred through an integrated transcriptional and translational repressive long undecoded transcript isoform (LUTI)-based mechanism that was recently shown to naturally regulate gene expression in yeast and other organisms. Cassette-induced MRP51 repression drove all mutant phenotypes we detected in cells deleted for DBP1. Selection cassette-mediated aberrant transcription events are not specific to this locus or a unique cassette but can be prevented by insertion of transcription insulators flanking the cassette. Our study suggests the existence of confounding off-target mutant phenotypes resulting from misregulated neighboring loci following genome edits in yeast. Furthermore, features of LUTI-based regulation are broadly conserved to eukaryotic organisms which indicates the potential that similar misregulation could be unnoticed in other edited organisms as well.",

We identify the disconnect2 (dis2) mutation for its failure to localize neural gap junction channels at electrical synapses. We mapped this mutation to chromosome 25 and identified a splice-altering mutation in the tjp1b gene. We demonstrated that the dis2 mutation disrupts tjp1b function using complementation analysis with CRISPR generated mutants. We conclude that the dis2 mutation disrupts the tjp1b gene that is required for electrical synapse formation.\n\nDescriptionNeural networks are circuits of neurons wired together during development that provide an animal with specialized behavioral outputs.

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli K-12 was originally isolated 100 years ago and since then, it has become an invaluable model organism and a cornerstone of molecular biology research. However, despite its apparent pedigree, since its initial isolation, E. coli K-12 has been repeatedly cultured, passaged, and mutagenized, resulting in an organism that carries extensive genetic changes. To understand more about the evolution of this important model organism, we have sequenced the genomes of two ancestral K-12 strains, WG1 and EMG2, considered to be the progenitors of many key laboratory strains. Our analysis confirms that these strains still carry genetic elements such as bacteriophage lambda ({lambda}) and the F plasmid, but also indicates that they have undergone extensive lab-based evolution. Thus, scrutinizing the genomes of ancestral E. coli K-12 strains, leads us to question whether E. coli K-12 is a sufficiently robust model organism for 21st century microbiology.\n\nDATA SUMMARYAll supporting data are provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Supplementary Figs. S1 to S14 and Supplementary File S1 are available with the online version of this article. All genome sequence data has been deposited in NCBI GenBank under Bioproject ID PRJNA848777. The assembled and annotated genomes of WG1 and EMG2 have been deposited with the accession numbers, CP099590 and CP099591 (WG1) and CP099588 and CP099589 (EMG2).\n\nImpact StatementSince its isolation in 1922, Escherichia coli K-12, has become arguably the premier model organism for contemporary science. The adoption of E. coli K-12 by many microbiologists across the globe, means that it has a complex pedigree, and, although many E. coli K-12 strains have been sequenced, little is known about the early versions of K-12, which still carry the F plasmid and bacteriophage {lambda}. To understand more about the lab-based evolution that has shaped this important model organism, we have sequenced two ancestral K-12 strains, WG1 and EMG2, that are considered to be the progenitors of many of the laboratory strains used today.",

    "abstract": "Argonaute 1 (AGO1), the principal protein component of microRNA-mediated regulation, plays a key role in plant growth and development. AGO1 physically interacts with the chaperone HSP90, which buffers cryptic genetic variation in plants and animals. We sought to determine whether genetic perturbation of AGO1 in Arabidopsis thaliana would also reveal cryptic genetic variation, and if so, whether AGO1-dependent loci overlap with those dependent on HSP90. To address these questions, we introgressed a hypomorphic mutant allele of AGO1 into a set of mapping lines derived from the commonly used Arabidopsis strains Col-0 and Ler. Although we identified several cases in which AGO1 buffered genetic variation, none of the AGO1-dependent loci overlapped with those buffered by HSP90 for the traits assayed. We focused on one buffered locus where AGO1 perturbation uncoupled the traits days to flowering and rosette leaf number, which are otherwise closely correlated. Using a bulk segregant approach, we identified a non-functional Ler hua2 mutant allele as the causal AGO1-buffered polymorphism. Introduction of a non-functional hua2 allele into a Col-0 ago1 mutant background recapitulated the Ler-dependent ago1 phenotype, implying that coupling of these traits involves different molecular players in these closely related strains. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that even though AGO1 and HSP90 buffer genetic variation in the same traits, these robustness regulators interact epistatically with different genetic loci, suggesting that higher-order epistasis is uncommon.\n\nArticle SummaryArgonaute 1 (AGO1), a key player in plant development, interacts with the chaperone HSP90 which buffers environmental and genetic variation. We found that AGO1 buffers environmental and genetic variation in the same traits; however, AGO1-dependent and HSP90-dependent loci do not overlap. Detailed analysis of a buffered locus found that a non-functional HUA2 allele decouples days to flowering and rosette leaf number in an AGO1-dependent manner, suggesting the AGO1-dependent buffering acts at the network level.",

To investigate for dynamic-relationships between gut-microbial communities and Lupus disease activity, we performed taxonomic surveys of fecal 16S rRNA gene amplicon-libraries from Lupus patients and healthy volunteers, obtained at serial timepoints over many months to several years. Individual Lupus patients commonly displayed imbalances in alpha and beta microbiota-diversity, which were uniquely different from healthy individuals as well as from other Lupus patients. Moreover, multivariate analysis of sequential Lupus libraries documented community-wide ecological microbiota instability overtime, most pronounced in patients with Lupus Nephritis LN), a severe form associated with worse prognosis. Lupus gut communities displayed transient spikes of pathogenic bacterial species, with by far the most prevalent being blooms of Ruminococcus blautia gnavus (RG), occurring in nearly half of LN patients often concordant with disease activity flares. RG strains isolated during disease flares, but not those isolated from healthy individuals or patients with inflammatory bowel disease, commonly expressed a novel, highly immunogenic cell wall-associated lipoglycan with conserved structural features that include a diacyl glycerol anchor. Cross-reactive antigenic determinants on these lipoglycans were recognized by murine monoclonal antibodies, and by spontaneously arising Lupus serum IgG antibodies with peak serum antibody responses also concordant with RG blooms. As SLE is frequently characterized by remitting-relapsing disease, despite appropriate treatment, we speculate that gut blooms of pathogenic bacteria, that impair gut barrier function and stoke systemic inflammation, directly contribute to immunopathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Classical genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are responsible for peptide presentation to T cells, thus playing a central role in immune defense against pathogens. These genes are subject to strong selective pressures including both balancing and directional selection, resulting in exceptional genetic diversity--thousands of alleles per gene. Moreover, some alleles appear to be shared between primate species, a phenomenon known as trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or incomplete lineage sorting, which is rare in the genome overall. However, despite the clinical and evolutionary importance of MHC diversity, we currently lack a full picture of primate MHC evolution. To start addressing this gap, we used Bayesian phylogenetic methods to determine the extent of TSP at six classical MHC genes. We find strong support for TSP in all six genes, including between humans and old-world monkeys in HLA-DRB1 and even-- remarkably--between humans and new-world monkeys in HLA-DQB1. Despite the long-term persistence of ancient lineages, we additionally observe rapid evolution at amino acids within the peptide-binding domain. The most rapidly-evolving positions are also strongly enriched for autoimmune and infectious disease associations. Together, these results suggest complex selective forces arising from differential peptide binding, which drive short-term allelic turnover within lineages while also maintaining deeply divergent lineages for at least 45 million years.",

Given a set of causal factors, it is important to understand the extent to which these causal factors explain some, all, or none of the genetic heritability, as measured by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with the trait. Using the mediation model framework with SNPs as the exposure, a trait of interest as the outcome, and the known causal factors as the mediators, we hypothesize that any unexplained association between the SNPs and the outcome trait is mediated by an additional unobserved, hidden causal factor.\n\nResultsWe propose a method to infer the effect size of this hidden mediating causal factor on the outcome trait by utilizing the estimated associations between a continuous outcome trait, the known causal factors, and the SNPs. The proposed method consists of three steps and, in the end, implements Markov chain Monte Carlo to obtain a posterior distribution for the hidden mediators effect size. We evaluate our proposed method via extensive simulations and show that when the model assumptions hold, our method estimates the effect size of the hidden mediator well and controls type I error rate if the hidden mediator does not exist.. In addition, we apply the method to the UK Biobank data and find that a potential hidden mediator for waist-hip ratio exists in the European population, and the hidden mediator has a large effect size relatively to the effect size of the known mediator BMI.\n\nConclusionsWe develop a framework to infer the effect of potential, hidden mediators influencing complex traits.

However, it remains unclear whether these responses reflect sensory inputs or behavioural modulation through sound-evoked body movement. We address this controversy by showing that sound-evoked activity in V1 of awake mice can be dissociated into auditory and behavioural components with distinct spatiotemporal profiles. The auditory component began at [~]27 ms, was found in superficial and deep layers and originated from auditory cortex, as shown by inactivation by muscimol. Sound-evoked orofacial movements correlated with V1 neural activity starting at [~]80-100 ms and explained auditory frequency-tuning. Visual, auditory and motor activity were expressed by segregated neuronal populations and during simultaneous audiovisual stimulation, visual representations remained dissociable from auditory and motor-related activity. This threefold dissociability of auditory, motor and visual processing is central to understanding how distinct inputs to visual cortex interact to support vision.",
