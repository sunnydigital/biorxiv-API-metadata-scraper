    "abstract": "Quantifying animal movements is necessary for answering a wide array of research questions in ecology and conservation biology. Consequently, ecologists have made considerable efforts to identify the best way to estimate an animals home range, and many methods of estimating home ranges have arisen over the past half century. Most of these methods fall into two distinct categories of estimators that have only recently been described in statistical detail: those that measure range distributions (methods such as Kernel Density Estimation that quantify the long-run behavior of a movement process that features restricted space use) and those that measure occurrence distributions (methods such as Brownian Bridge Movement Models and the Correlated Random Walk Library that quantify uncertainty in an animal movement path during a specific period of observation). In this paper, we use theory, simulations, and empirical analysis to demonstrate the importance of applying these two classes of space use estimators appropriately and distinctly. Conflating range and occurrence distributions can have serious consequences for ecological inference and conservation practice. For example, in most situations, home-range estimates quantified using occurrence estimators are too small, and this problem is exacerbated by ongoing improvements in tracking technology that enable more frequent and more accurate data on animal movements. We encourage researchers to use range estimators to estimate the area of home ranges and occurrence estimators to answer other questions in movement ecology, such as when and where an animal crosses a linear feature, visits a location of interest, or interacts with other animals.\n\nOpen Research StatementTracking data on Aepyceros melampus, Beatragus hunteri, Bycanistes bucinator, Cerdocyon thous, Eulemur rufifrons, Glyptemys insculpta, Gyps coprotheres, Madoqua guentheri, Ovis canadensis, Propithecus verreauxi, Sus scrofa, and Ursus arctos are publicly archived in the Dryad repository (Noonan et al. 2018; https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v5051j2), as are data from Procapra gutturosa (Fleming et al. 2014a; https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.45157).

    "abstract": "The rapid decline of biodiversity as a consequence of increased environmental impact by human activities requires urgent action against the ongoing crisis. At the heart of conservation policy is the debate on quality versus quantity: should the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework focus on maximising total protected area, or pursue instead qualitative targets? To improve conservation practices, we need to both understand the current trend of biodiversity and the factors driving the decline. We address this by: (1) projecting current European butterfly population trends for the next 50 and 100 years, (2) comparing the decline in species richness, phylogenetic diversity and habitat specialization among different habitats, and (3) estimating the relationship between recent trends in habitat quality or quantity and the decline of multiple metrics of European butterfly diversity. We do not find any significant relationship between diversity loss and habitat area loss and conclude that neither long-term nor short-term changes in habitat area are primary predictors of large-scale butterfly decline in Europe. Habitat quality emerges as the most crucial factor in our analyses - both the area affected and the severity of habitat quality reduction. Habitat degradation causes vegetation changes in structure and diversity, which affect butterfly survival. We also estimate a higher decline of habitat specialists than generalist species. We conclude that habitat protection cannot focus solely on the maximization of habitat area but urgently needs to restore high quality ecosystems to provide the full range of ecological requirements for biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Caste-based reproductive division of labour in social insects is built on asymmetries in resource allocation within colonies. Kings and queens dominantly consume limited resources for reproduction, while non-reproductive castes such as workers and soldiers help reproductive castes. Studying the regulation of such asymmetries in resource allocation is crucial for understanding the maintenance of sociality in insects, although the molecular background is poorly understood. We focused on uric acid, which is reserved and utilized as a valuable nitrogen source in wood-eating termites. We found that king- and queen-specific degradation of uric acid is the key to reproduction in the subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus. The urate oxidase gene (RsUAOX), which catalyses the first step of nitrogen recycling from stored uric acid, was highly expressed in mature kings and queens, and upregulated with differentiation into neotenic kings/queens. Suppression of uric acid degradation decreased the number of eggs laid per queen. Uric acid was shown to be provided by workers to reproductive castes. Our results suggest that the capacity to use nitrogen, which is essential for the protein synthesis required for reproduction, contributes to colony cohesion expressed as the reproductive monopoly held by kings and queens.",

    "abstract": "After mating, female mosquitoes need a blood meal to promote the reproductive process. The blood-feeding transmits extremely harmful infections including malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, and other arboviruses, making mosquitoes one of the most harmful creatures to human health. The selection and localization of the host by mosquitoes mainly depends on the trace chemical cues emitted by the host into the environment, and the sense of smell is the main way to perceive these trace chemical cues. However, the knowledge of the olfactory mechanism is not enough to meet the needs of mosquito control. Unlike previous studies that focused on the olfactory receptor recognition spectrum to reveal the olfactory mechanism of mosquito host localization. In this paper, we proposed that artificial defects in mosquito antennal flagellomeres may affect their blood-feeding behavior, and through rationally designed behavioral experiments, we found that the 6th and 7th flagellomeres on Aedes albopictus antenna are important in the olfactory detection of host searching. Meanwhile, the morphology and distribution of sensilla on each antenna flagellomere were also analyzed and discussed in this paper.",

A set of reduced hindwings, the halteres beat at the same frequency as the lift-generating forewings and sense inertial forces via mechanosensory campaniform sensilla. Though it is well-established that haltere ablation makes stable flight impossible, the specific role of wing-synchronous input has not been established. Using small iron filings attached to the halteres of tethered flies and an alternating electromagnetic field, we experimentally decoupled the wings and halteres of flying Drosophila and observed the resulting changes in wingbeat amplitude and head orientation. We find that asynchronous haltere input results in fast saccades in the wing but not the head. We also find that wing and gaze optomotor responses are disrupted differently by asynchronous input. These effects of wing-asynchronous haltere input show that specific sensory information is necessary for maintaining wing amplitude stability and adaptive gaze control.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities have vital roles in systems essential to human health and agriculture, such as gut and soil microbiomes, and there is growing interest in engineering designer consortia for applications in biotechnology (e.g., personalized probiotics, bioproduction of high-value products, biosensing). The capacity to monitor and model metabolite exchange in dynamic microbial consortia can provide foundational information important to understand the community level behaviors that emerge, a requirement for building novel consortia. Where experimental approaches for monitoring metabolic exchange are technologically challenging, computational tools can enable greater access to the fate of both chemicals and microbes within a consortium. In this study, we developed an in-silico model of a synthetic microbial consortia of sucrose-secreting Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Escherichia coli W. Our model was built on the NUFEB framework for Individual-based Modeling (IbM) and optimized for biological accuracy using experimental data. We showed that the relative level of sucrose secretion regulates not only the steady-state support for heterotrophic biomass, but also the temporal dynamics of consortia growth. In order to determine the importance of spatial organization within the consortium, we fit a regression model to spatial data and used it to accurately predict colony fitness. We found that some of the critical parameters for fitness prediction were inter-colony distance, initial biomass, induction level, and distance from the center of the simulation volume. We anticipate that the synergy between experimental and computational approaches will improve our ability to design consortia with novel function.\n\nAuthor SummaryMicrobial communities, play important, yet poorly understood roles in health and agriculture. As we develop a better understanding of how these communities interact together, as well as with their host organisms, there is growing interest in engineering communities with specific functions, such as for treating disease, personalized probiotics, or aiding plants with nutrient uptake. To better understand how these microbes interact with each other, we want to monitor the exchange of metabolites and the locations of the microbes, tasks which at present are technically challenging, if not impossible. Where experimental approaches for monitoring metabolites are limited, computational tools can enable greater access to the fate of both chemicals and microbes within a community. In this study, we developed a computerized model of a synthetic microbial community of two bacteria, one which performs photosynthesis and supplies sugar and another which consumes the sugar for growth. We showed that the relative level of sugar secretion regulates not only the steady-state support for the consumer partners growth, but also how the community changes with time. To determine the importance of spatial organization within the community, we fit a model and used it to predict colony growth. We anticipate that the synergy between experimental and computational approaches will improve our ability to design microbial communities with new functions.",

    "abstract": "Contrary to a photographer, who puts a great effort in keeping the lens still, eyes insistently move even during fixation. This benefits signal decorrelation, which underlies an efficient encoding of visual information. Yet, camera motion is not sufficient alone; it must be coupled with a sensor specifically selective to temporal changes. Indeed, motion induced on standard imagers only results in burring effects. Neuromorphic sensors represent a valuable solution. Here we characterize the response of an event-based camera equipped with Fixational Eye Movements (FEMs) on both synthetic and natural images. Our analyses prove that the system starts an early stage of redundancy suppression, as a precursor of subsequent whitening processes on the amplitude spectrum. This does not come at the price of corrupting structural information contained in local spatial phase across oriented axes. Isotropy of FEMs ensures proper representations of image features without introducing biases towards specific contrast orientations.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern around the globe. As a result, researchers always look for new compounds to develop new antibiotic drugs for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bacteriocin becomes a promising antimicrobial agent to fight against antibiotic resistance, due to its narrow killing spectrum. Sequence matching methods are widely used to identify bacteriocins by comparing them with the known bacteriocin sequences; however, these methods often fail to detect new bacteriocin sequences due to sequences high diversity. The ability to use a machine learning approach can help find new highly dissimilar bacteriocins for developing highly effective antibiotic drugs. The aim of this work is to identify optimal sets of features and develop a machine learning-based software tool for predicting bacteriocin protein sequences with high accuracy. We extracted potential features from known bacteriocin and non-bacteriocin sequences by considering the physicochemical and structural properties of the protein sequences. Then we reduced the feature set using statistical justifications and recursive feature elimination technique. Finally, we built support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models using the selected features and our models can achieve accuracy up to 95.54%. We compared the performance of our method with a popular sequence matching-based approach and a deep learning-based method. We also developed a software tool called Bacteriocin Prediction (BacPred) that implements the prediction model using the optimal set of features obtained from this study.

    "abstract": "Imaging-by-sequencing methods are an emerging alternative to conventional optical micro- or nanoscale imaging. In these methods, molecular networks form through proximity-dependent association between DNA molecules carrying random sequence identifiers. DNA strands record pairwise associations such that network structure may be recovered by sequencing which, in turn, reveals the underlying spatial relationships between molecules comprising the network. Determining the computational reconstruction strategy that makes the best use of the information (in terms of spatial localization accuracy, robustness to noise, and scalability) in these networks is an open problem. We present a graph-based technique for reconstructing a diversity of molecular network classes in 2 and 3 dimensions without prior knowledge of their fundamental generation mechanisms. The model achieves robustness by obtaining an unbiased sampling of local and global network structure using random walks, making use of minimal prior assumptions. Images are recovered from networks in two stages of dimensionality reduction first with this structural discovery step followed by the manifold learning step. By breaking the process into stages, computational complexity could be reduced leading to fast and accurate performance. Our method represents a means by which diverse molecular network generation strategies could be unified with a common reconstruction framework.",

Guided by RAZUL sequence similarity, we test and demonstrate here that the E6AP AZUL binds transiently to the UBA of proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN1/2. Despite a weak binding affinity, E6AP AZUL is recruited to UBQLN2 phase-separated droplets and E6AP interacts with UBQLN1/2 in cells. Steady-state and transfer NOE experiments indicate direct interaction of AZUL with the UBQLN1 UBA domain. Intermolecular contacts identified by NOESY data were combined with AlphaFold2-Multimer predictions to yield an AZUL:UBA model structure. We also identify a concentration-dependent oligomerization domain directly adjacent to UBQLN1/2 UBA (UBA-adjacent, UBAA) that is -helical and allosterically reconfigured by AZUL binding to UBA. These data lead to a model of E6AP recruitment to UBQLN1/2 by AZUL:UBA interaction and provide fundamental information on binding requirements for interactions in droplets and cells.",

    "abstract": "We show evidence of the association of RNA Polymerase II (RNAP) with chromatin in a core-shell organization, reminiscent of microphase separation where the cores comprise dense chromatin and the shell, RNAP and chromatin with low density. These observations motivate our physical model for the regulation of core-shell chromatin organization. Here, we model chromatin as a multiblock copolymer, comprising active and inactive regions (blocks) that are both in poor solvent and tend to be condensed in the absence of binding proteins. However, we show that the solvent quality for the active regions of chromatin can be regulated by the binding of protein complexes (e.g. RNAP). Using the theory of polymer brushes, we find that such binding leads to swelling of the active chromatin regions which in turn, modifies the spatial organization of the inactive regions. In addition, we use simulations to study spherical chromatin micelles, whose cores comprise inactive regions and shells comprise active regions and bound protein complexes. In spherical micelles the swelling increases the number of inactive cores and controls their size. Thus, genetic modifications affecting the binding strength of chromatin-binding protein complexes may modulate the solvent quality experienced by chromatin and regulate the physical organization of the genome.",

    "abstract": "The composition and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important factors in the development and progression of cancers, and the ECM is implicated in promoting tumour growth and restricting anti-tumour therapies through multiple mechanisms. The characterisation of differences in ECM composition between normal and diseased tissues may aid in identifying novel diagnostic markers, prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets for drug development. Using tissue from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing curative intent surgery, we characterised quantitative tumour-specific ECM proteome signatures by mass spectrometry, identifying 161 matrisome proteins differentially regulated between tumour tissue and nearby non-malignant lung tissue. We defined a collagen hydroxylation functional protein network that is enriched in the lung tumour microenvironment. We validated two novel putative extracellular markers of NSCLC, the collagen cross-linking enzyme peroxidasin and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 16 (ADAMTS16), for discrimination of malignant and non-malignant lung tissue. These proteins were up-regulated in lung tumour samples, and high PXDN and ADAMTS16 gene expression was associated with shorter survival of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients, respectively. These data reveal tumour matrisome signatures in human NSCLC.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=19 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510064v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (8K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b34045org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@40a5a9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c150corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@89c6f2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Developmental signaling pathways associated with growth factors such as TGFb are commonly dysregulated in melanoma. Here we identified a human TGFb enhancer specifically activated in melanoma cells treated with TGFB1 ligand. We generated stable transgenic zebrafish with this TGFb Induced Enhancer driving green fluorescent protein (TIE:EGFP). TIE:EGFP was not expressed in normal melanocytes or early melanomas but was expressed in spatially distinct regions of advanced melanomas. Single cell RNA- sequencing revealed that TIE:EGFP+ melanoma cells down-regulated interferon response, while up-regulating a novel set of chronic TGFb target genes. ChIP-sequencing demonstrated that AP-1 factor binding is required for activation of chronic TGFb response. Overexpression of SATB2, a chromatin remodeler associated with tumor spreading, showed activation of TGFb signaling in melanoma precursor zones and early melanomas. Confocal imaging and flow cytometric analysis showed that macrophages are recruited to TIE:EGFP+regions and preferentially phagocytose TIE:EGFP+ cells. This work identifies a TGFb induced immune response and demonstrates the need for the development of chronic TGFb biomarkers to predict patient response to TGFb inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Tumour volume is typically calculated using only length and width measurements, using width as a proxy for height in a 1:1 ratio. When tracking tumour growth over time, important morphological information and measurement accuracy is lost by ignoring height, which we show is a unique variable. Lengths, widths, and heights of 9,522 subcutaneous tumours in mice were measured using 3D and thermal imaging. The average width:height ratio was found to be 1:3 proving that using width as a proxy for height overestimates tumour volume. Comparing volumes calculated with and without tumour height to the true volumes of excised tumours indeed showed that using the volume formula including height produced volumes 36X more accurate. Monitoring the width:height relationship (prominence) across tumour growth curves indicated that prominence varied, and that height could change independent of width. Twelve cell lines were investigated individually; the scale of tumour prominence was cell line-dependent with relatively less prominent tumours (MC38, BL2, LL/2) and more prominent tumours (RENCA, HCT116) detected. Prominence trends across the growth cycle were also dependent on cell line; prominence was correlated with tumour growth in some cell lines (4T1, CT26, LNCaP), but not others (MC38, TC-1, LL/2). When pooled, invasive cell lines produced tumours that were significantly less prominent at volumes >1200mm3 compared to non-invasive cell lines (P<0.001). Modelling was used to show the impact of the increased accuracy gained by including height in volume calculations on several efficacy study outcomes. Variations in accuracy contribute to experimental variation and irreproducibility of data, therefore we strongly advise researchers to measure height to improve accuracy in tumour studies.",

    "abstract": "Aldicarb sulfoxide is the metabolite of the exceedingly deadly carbamate insecticide Aldicarb. Aldicarb sulfoxide is easily soluble in water and has been identified in groundwater. Moreover, Aldicarb sulfoxide is highly hazardous to mammals. However, the toxicity data of Aldicarb sulfoxide is scarce. Here, the effects of relatively low dosages of exposure to Aldicarb sulfoxide on the blood biochemical, hematological, and histopathological parameters were examined in SD rats. The rats were treated with Aldicarb sulfoxide orally at dosages of 0, 6.3, 18.9, and 56.7 g per kg b.w. daily for 12 weeks. The results revealed that Aldicarb sulfoxide induced significant alterations in liver-related biochemical parameters, glucose level, cholesterol level, and uric acid level. Histopathological testing demonstrated cellular alterations in the liver of 18.9 and 56.7 g/kg BW. Together, our data demonstrated that Aldicarb sulfoxide exposure causes liver injury. Furthermore, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was less than 6.3 g/kg BW, and the lowest benchmark dose (BMD) value was 0.03 g/kg BW. Accordingly, Aldicarb sulfoxides derived no-effect level (DNEL) was calculated as 0.00035 g/kg BW. Thus, this work is an important reference for supervising Aldicarb sulfoxide in the environment and determining safe exposure limits for Aldicarb sulfoxide.",

We cloned two atypical resistance genes that provide resistance to Alternaria solani and Colorado potato beetle through the production of tetraose steroidal glycoalkaloids. Moreover, we provide in vitro evidence to show that these compounds have potential against a range of different (potato pathogenic) fungi. This research links structural variation in steroidal glycoalkaloids to resistance against potato diseases and pests. Further research on the biosynthesis of plant defence compounds in different tissues, their toxicity, and the mechanisms for detoxification, can aid the effective use of such compounds to improve sustainability of our food production.",

    "abstract": "Several commercially important secondary metabolites are produced and accumulated in high amounts by glandular trichomes, giving the prospect of using them as metabolic cell factories. Due to extremely high metabolic fluxes through glandular trichomes, previous research focused on how such flows are achieved. The question regarding their bioenergetics became even more interesting with the discovery of photosynthetic activity in some glandular trichomes. Despite recent advances, how primary metabolism contributes to the high metabolic fluxes in glandular trichomes is still not fully elucidated. Using computational methods and available multi-omics data, we first developed a quantitative framework to investigate the possible role of photosynthetic energy supply in terpenoid production and next tested experimentally the simulation-driven hypothesis. With this work, we provide the first reconstruction of specialised metabolism in Type-VI photosynthetic glandular trichomes of Solanum lycopersicum. Our model predicted that increasing light intensities results in a shift of carbon partitioning from catabolic to anabolic reactions driven by the energy availability of the cell. Moreover, we show the benefit of shifting between isoprenoid pathways under different light regimes, leading to a production of different classes of terpenes. Our computational predictions were confirmed in vivo, demonstrating a significant increase in production of monoterpenoids while the sesquiterpenes remained unchanged under higher light intensities. The outcomes of this research provide quantitative measures to assess the beneficial role of chloroplast in glandular trichomes for enhanced production of secondary metabolites and can guide the design of new experiments that aim at modulating terpenoid production.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510054v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (9K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ec6f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@107d0c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a545corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@98747b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Please check the journals author guidelines for whether a graphical abstract, key points, new findings, or other items are required for display in the Table of Contents.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable capacity of plants to tolerate and accumulate tremendous amount of nickel is a complex adaptative trait that appeared independently in more than 700 species distributed in about fifty families. Nickel hyperaccumulation is thus proposed as a model to investigate the evolution of complex traits in plants. However, the mechanisms involved in nickel hyperaccumulation are still poorly understood in part because comparative transcriptomic analyses struggle to identify genes linked to this trait from a wide diversity of species. In this work, we have implemented a methodology based on the quantification of the expression of orthologous groups and phylogenetic comparative methods to identify genes which expression is correlated to the nickel hyperaccumulation trait. More precisely, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and reads quantification for each species on its own transcriptome using available RNA-Seq datasets from 15 nickel hyperaccumulator and non-accumulator species. Assembled contigs were associated to orthologous groups built using proteomes predicted from completed plant genome sequences. We then analyzed the transcription profiles of 5953 orthologous groups from distant species using a phylogenetic ANOVA. We identified 31 orthologous groups with an expression shift associated with nickel hyperaccumulation. These orthologous groups correspond to genes that have been previously implicated in nickel accumulation, and to new candidates involved in this trait. We thus believe that this method can be successfully applied to identify genes linked to other complex traits from a wide diversity of species.",

Here we explicitly model the entire set of voxels within a brain mask as nodes of high-resolution, subject-specific graphs. We define the strength of local voxel-to-voxel connections using diffusion tensors and orientation distribution functions derived from diffusion MRI data. We study the graphs Laplacian spectral properties on data from the Human Connectome Project. We then assess the extent of inter-subject variability of the Laplacian eigenmodes via a procrustes validation scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the extent to which functional MRI data are shaped by the underlying anatomical structure via graph signal processing. The graph Laplacian eigen-modes manifest highly resolved spatial profiles, reflecting distributed patterns that correspond to major white matter pathways. We show that the intrinsic dimensionality of the eigenspace of such high-resolution graphs is only a mere fraction of the graph dimensions. By projecting task and resting-state data on low-frequency graph Laplacian eigenmodes, we show that brain activity can be well approximated by a small subset of low-frequency components. The proposed graphs open new avenues in studying the brain, be it, by exploring their organisational properties via graph or spectral graph theory, or by treating them as the scaffold on which brain function is observed at the individual level.",

    "abstract": "Extinction is a fundamental form of inhibitory learning that is important for adapting to changing environmental contingencies. While numerous studies have investigated the neural correlates of extinction using Pavlovian fear conditioning and appetitive operant reward-seeking procedures, less is known about the neural circuitry mediating the extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding. Here, we aimed to generate an extensive brain activation map of extinction learning in a rat model of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. Male Long-Evans rats were trained to associate a conditioned stimulus (CS; 20 s white noise) with the delivery of a 10% sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.3 ml/CS) to a fluid port. Control groups also received CS presentations, but sucrose was delivered either during the inter-trial interval or in the home-cage. After conditioning, 1 or 6 extinction sessions were conducted in which the CS was presented but sucrose was withheld. We performed Fos immunohistochemistry and network connectivity analyses on a set of cortical, striatal, thalamic, and amygdalar brain regions. Neural activity in the prelimbic cortex, ventral orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus was greater during recall relative to extinction. Conversely, prolonged extinction following 6 sessions induced increased neural activity in the infralimbic cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens shell compared to home-cage controls. All these structures were similarly recruited during recall on the first extinction session. These findings provide novel evidence for the contribution of brain areas and neural networks that are differentially involved in the recall versus extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding.",

    "abstract": "Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a pivotal approach in clinical and basic neurophysiology, allowing us to extract the summed activity of motor units in a given muscle. Due to the bipolar nature of the motor unit action potential, the sEMG is a non-linear representation of their underlying motor unit activity and therefore affected by signal cancellation. It is not clear how this cancellation influences evoked responses in sEMG. The aim of our study was to characterise how representative an evoked sEMG response was to the firing behaviour of the underlying motor pool. To do this, we first simulated a population of motor units (and their action potentials) that responded to a stimulus with a change in firing probability. Their activity was summed then rectified to generate a simulated sEMG signal or was rectified and then summed, to generate a sEMG signal with no cancellation. By comparing the two responses to that of the underlying pool we would then compare for discrepancies. We repeated this process but by using the responses of tibialis anterior motor units to weak tibial nerve stimulation. We find that both for the simulated and experimental data the response measured through the sEMG is almost always an underestimate of the evoked response in the underlying motor pool. This is the case for both inhibitory and excitatory evoked responses. The magnitude of the inaccuracy depends on the size of the evoked response, but it cannot be accounted solely by signal cancellation, suggesting other factors may also contribute.",

    "abstract": "System level analysis of single cell data is rapidly transforming the field of immunometabolism. However, metabolic profiling of single cells and small populations by flow and mass cytometry is extremely limited by the availability of specific reagents such as antibodies and fluorescently nutrient analogues. Given the competitive demand for nutrients in pathogenic microenvironments including sites of infection, tumours and autoinflammation, there is a need to understand how and when immune cells access these nutrients. Fluorescent-tagging of nutrients is one approach to study nutrient transport but is extremely limited in its usefulness as tagging usually changes the transport characteristics and transporter specificity of the nutrient. Herein, we developed a completely new approach for single cell analysis of nutrient uptake where a fluorophore is attached to a functionalized amino acid after it has been transported across the plasma membrane and is within the cell. This in-cell biorthogonal labelling ensures that bona fide transport has been measured. System ASC transporter SLC1A5/ASCT2 transports multiple amino acids, most notably the crucial fuel glutamine, and has essential roles in supporting immune metabolism, signalling and function. This flow cytometry assay allows for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative measurement of SLC1A5-mediated uptake, which we used to interrogate the transport capacity of the complex immune subpopulations within the thymus, at a single cell resolution previously \"unreachable\". Taken together, our findings provide an easy procedure to assess which cells support their function via SLC1A5 mediated uptake of amino acids in a sensitive single cell assay. This assay is a significant addition to the single-cell metabolic toolbox required to decode the metabolic landscape of complex immune microenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common diseases in the world and its prevalence ratio is still increasing. Patients with T2DM have diverse pathophysiological changes like as macrovascular, microvascular diseases, cancers as well as abnormal glucose metabolism. Thus, there are urgent needs to develop relevant biomarkers for the broad range of pathophysiology in patients with T2DM. We analyzed the signatures of serum miRNAs with the miRNA array analysis and reverse-transcription based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 50 patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) and 15 normal subjects. Array analysis showed that 19 miRNAs were up-regulated more than 2-fold and 71 miRNAs were down-regulated less than 0.5 in T2DM in comparison with normal subjects. Top 5 of up-regulated miRNAs were miR-3619-3p, miR-557, miR-6850-5p, miR-3648, miR-4730, and 5 of most down-regulated miRNAs were miR-5100, miR-4454, miR-1260b, miR-7975, miR-6131. We selected 4 miRNAs for validation analysis with RT-qPCR based on the abundance enough for reliable analyses and disease-specificities reported in previous reports. Serum miR-126-3p was down-regulated (3.21-fold, p<0.05) in T2DM, and miR-10a up-regulated (1.94-fold, p<0.05). However, none of single miRNA had significant correlation with clinical data and state. Data of the paired miRNAs: miR-10a and miR-200c, or miR-126 and miR-10a, clearly differentiated T2DM patients from normal subjects (p<0.05). Our study showed the paired-miRNA analyses as the more effective diagnostics for T2DM than the single miRNA analysis.",

    "abstract": "Some epigenetic information can be transmitted between generations without changes in the underlying DNA sequence. Changes in epigenetic regulation, termed epimutations, can occur spontaneously and be propagated in populations in a manner reminiscent of DNA mutations. Epimutations mediated by small non-coding RNAs occur in C. elegans and persist for around 3-5 generations on average. Here, we explored whether chromatin states also undergo spontaneous change and whether this could be a potential alternative mechanism for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. We compared the chromatin and gene expression profiles at matched time points from three independent lineages of C. elegans propagated at minimal population size. Spontaneous changes in chromatin occurred in around 1% of regulatory regions each generation. Some were heritable epimutations and were significantly enriched for heritable changes in expression of nearby protein-coding genes. Most chromatin-mediated epimutations were short-lived but a subset had longer duration. Genes subject to long-lived epimutations were enriched for multiple components of xenobiotic response pathways. This points to a possible role for epimutations in adaptation to environmental stressors.",

    "abstract": "In the germline, stem cells undergo asymmetric cell division (ACD) to give rise to one new stem cell as well as one daughter cell that differentiates and eventually gives rise to the gamete (egg or sperm). The silent sister hypothesis proposes the selective inheritance of one set of sister chromatids carrying specific epigenetic marks to explain how genetically identical stem and daughter cells can adopt different fates. It also proposes that centromeres of sister chromatids might differ epigenetically. In Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs), the centromeric histone CENP-A - CID in flies - is asymmetrically distributed between sister chromatids such that chromosomes that end up in the GSC harbour more CID at centromeres. In this system, a model of  mitotic drive has been proposed. According to this model, stronger and earlier centromere and kinetochore interactions with microtubules bias sister chromatid segregation during ACD. Here we show that in Drosophila males, CID, CENP-C and CAL1 are asymmetrically distributed between newly divided GSCs and daughter cells that have entered S-phase of the next cell cycle. We find that overexpression of CID, overexpression of CID together with CAL1 or CENP-C depletion disrupts CID asymmetry, with an increased pool of GSCs relative to daughter cells detectable in the niche. This result suggests a shift toward GSC self-renewal rather than differentiation, which is important to maintain tissue homeostasis. Over-expression of CAL1 does not disrupt asymmetry, nor does it affect the GSC and daughter cell balance, but instead drives germ cell proliferation in the niche. Our results in male GSCs are closely aligned with previous observations in female GSCs, indicating that despite differences in signaling, organisation and niche composition, centromere asymmetry and its effects on GSC maintenance are conserved between the sexes.",

    "abstract": "Wildfire is a common phenomenon in Mediterranean countries but the 2022 fire season has been extreme in southwest Europe (Portugal, Spain and France). Burned area has exceeded the 2001-2021 median by a factor of 52 in some regions and large wildfires started to occur in June-July, earlier than the traditional fire season. These anomalies were associated with record-breaking values of fuel dryness, atmospheric water demand and pyrometeorological conditions. For instance, live fuel moisture content was below the historical minima for almost 50% of the season in some regions. Wildfire impacts are primarily social and economical in these fire-prone landscapes, but they may prompt large-scale degradation if this anomaly becomes more common under climate change, as is expected. As climate changes intensify, we can expect this to become the new normal in large parts of the continent. Climate change is already here and delaying fuel management will only worsen the wildfire problem. Here we provide a preliminary though comprehensive analysis of 2022s wildfire season in southwest Europe (Portugal, France and Spain).",

    "abstract": "Civilisations including ancient ones, have shaped the global ecosystems in many ways through a co-evolution of landscapes and humans. However, the cultural legacies of ancient and lost civilisations are seldom considered in conservation. Here using a continental-scale dataset containing over 1,000 data records on the localities, land cover, protection status and cultural values related to ancient steppic burial mounds (so-called  kurgans), we evaluated how these iconic and widespread landmarks can contribute to grassland conservation in the Eurasian steppes, which is one of the most endangered biomes on Earth. By using Bayesian logistic generalized regressions and proportional odds logistic regressions, we aimed to reveal the potential of mounds in preserving grasslands considering landscapes with different levels of land use transformation. We also compared the conservation potential of mounds situated inside and outside protected areas and assessed whether the presence of cultural, historical or spiritual values support the maintenance of grasslands on them. We revealed that kurgans have enormous importance in preserving grasslands in transformed landscapes outside protected areas, where they can act as habitat islands, and provide an additional pillar for conservation by contributing to habitat conservation and improvement of habitat connectivity. We found that besides their steep slopes hindering ploughing, the existence of cultural, historical or religious values could almost double the chance for grassland occurrence on kurgans due to the related extensive land use and the respect of local communities. As the estimated number of steppic mounds is about 600,000 and also similar historical features exist in all continents, our results can be upscaled to a global level. Our results also suggest that an integrative socio-ecological approach in conservation might support the positive synergistic effects of conservational, landscape and cultural values.",

In addition, soil biota and their associated functions may show strong temporal changes in their response to environmental changes, yet most current studies have only focused on one of these potential drivers or have measured soil functioning only once during the peak growing season. Therefore, we know little about the relative importance of the different mechanisms by which nitrogen enrichment affects soil communities, functioning and temporal stability.\nC_LIO_LIIn a large grassland experiment manipulating nitrogen enrichment, plant species richness, functional composition and foliar pathogen presence, we measured activities of two enzymes, {beta}-glucosidase and acid phosphatase, as indicators of soil functioning. We did so across different seasons and years to assess their temporal dynamics and how consistently they responded to multiple drivers.\nC_LIO_LINitrogen addition was the most important driver of {beta}-glucosidase activity, and it increased {beta}-glucosidase activity over time. However, interactions between plant attributes and fungicide application were the main drivers of acid phosphatase activity.

    "abstract": "Effective suppression of transposable elements (TEs) is paramount to maintain genomic integrity and organismal fitness. In D. melanogaster, flamenco is a master suppressor of TEs, preventing their movement from somatic ovarian support cells to the germline. It is transcribed by Pol II as a long (100s of kb), single-stranded, primary transcript, that is metabolized into Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that target active TEs via antisense complementarity. flamenco is thought to operate as a trap, owing to its high content of recent horizontally transferred TEs that are enriched in antisense orientation. Using newly-generated long read genome data, which is critical for accurate assembly of repetitive sequences, we find that flamenco has undergone radical transformations in sequence content and even copy number across simulans clade Drosophilid species. D. simulans flamenco has duplicated and diverged, and neither copy exhibits synteny with D. melanogaster beyond the core promoter. Moreover, flamenco organization is highly variable across D. simulans individuals. Next, we find that D. simulans and D. mauritiana flamenco display signatures of a dual-stranded cluster, with ping-pong signals in the testis and/or embryo. This is accompanied by increased copy numbers of germline TEs, consistent with these regions operating as functional dual stranded clusters. Overall, the physical and functional diversity of flamenco orthologs is testament to the extremely dynamic consequences of TE arms races on genome organization, not only amongst highly related species, but even amongst individuals.",

Confirming and extending results from the 1990s, we found that the SRD are present at variable frequencies in populations, and that the f element is overall more frequent than Wolbachia. The two SRD never co-occur at high frequency in any population, suggesting an apparent mutual exclusion. We also detected Wolbachia or the f element in some males, which likely reflects insufficient titer to induce feminization or presence of masculinizing alleles. Our results are consistent with a single integration event of a Wolbachia genome in the A. vulgare genome at the origin of the f element, which contradicts an earlier hypothesis of frequent losses and gains. We identified strong linkage between Wolbachia strains and mitochondrial haplotypes, but no association between the f element and mitochondrial background.

    "abstract": "Sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi) is an ectoparasite that causes major production losses in the salmon aquaculture industry of the southern hemisphere. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is an important salmonid for the aquaculture industry and a species which is highly susceptible to sea lice infestation. Genetic variation for resistance to sea lice, defined as parasite load, has been found in Atlantic salmon. In addition, sea lice load has been shown to be a polygenic trait, controlled by several quantitative trait loci (QTL) which have small to medium effect, making them difficult to map with sufficient statistical power when sample sizes are limited. The use of medium density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) can also adversely affect the success of identifying genetic variants significantly associated to sea lice load. In order to improve the ability to detect QTL significantly associated to sea lice load, we combined genotype imputation from medium- to high SNP-density and performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across different populations of Atlantic salmon. The imputation of genotypes of 6,144 fish challenged against sea lice from four year-classes was performed to increase density from 70K SNPs to 600K SNPs. A meta-GWAS was then carried out for three different traits: lice count, lice density and log-lice density. Using this approach, we detected a genomic region highly associated to sea lice load on Atlantic salmon chromosomes (ssa) 3 and 12 pronounced peaks and several other regions surpassing the significance threshold across almost all other chromosomes. We also identified important genes within the QTL regions, many of these genes are involved in tissue reparation, such as Mucin-16-like isoform X2 and Filamentous growth regulator 23-like isoform X1. The QTL region on ssa03 also contained cytoskeletal-modifying and immune response related genes such as Coronin 1A and Claudin. Our results confirm the highly polygenic architecture of sea lice load, but they also show that high experimental power can lead to the identification of candidate genes and thus to increased insight into the biology of sea lice resistance in Altantic salmon.",

We thus hope to help illuminate how primates approach tool tasks internally, such as breaking open a nutshell between a wooden anvil and a stone hammer to access its nutritious contents or fishing for termites with a leaf midrib. Ontologies are widely used in domains such as linguistics, medicine, archaeology, and cultural heritage, to help experts organize, reason on, and discover new knowledge in their field. We build a novel ontology, ROCA (from  roca - - rock, in Spanish) with which we can describe instances of tool use in a formal and uniform manner, including well-known primate ethograms and chaines operatoires. We will see that representing tool use and tool making with an ontology provides a uniform, unified, acentric, dynamic, and human-readable way to handle knowledge obtained from literature and to perform knowledge discovery. We build a representative corpus of 75 articles and books on primate and hominin tool use and tool making. We then extract and give semantic structure such as taxonomical relationships to relevant vocabulary, both manually and automatically, using NLP text mining techniques. We then show how the ontology can be used to discover new knowledge related to tool use and tool making.",

    "abstract": "The present study characterized associations among brain metabolite levels, applying bivariate and multivariate (i.e., factor analysis) statistical methods to tCr-referenced estimates of the major PRESS 1H-MRS metabolites (i.e., tNAA/tCr, tCho/tCr, mI/tCr, Glx/tCr), acquired from medial parietal lobe in a large (n=299), well-characterized international cohort of healthy volunteers (Povazan et al., 2020). Results supported the hypothesis that 1H-MRS-measured metabolite estimates are moderately intercorrelated (Mr = 0.42, SDr = 0.11, ps < 0.001), with more than half (i.e., 57%) of the total variability in metabolite estimates common to (i.e., shared by) all metabolites. Older age was significantly associated with lower levels of common metabolite variance (CMV; {beta} = -0.09, p = 0.048), despite not being associated with levels of any individual metabolite. Holding CMV levels constant, females had significantly lower levels of total choline (i.e., unique metabolite variance or UMV; {beta} = -0.19, p < 0.001), mirroring significant bivariate correlations between sex and total choline reported previously. If replicated, these results would suggest that applied 1H-MRS researchers should shift their analytical framework from examining bivariate associations between individual metabolites and specialty-dependent (e.g., clinical, research) variables of interest (e.g., using t-tests) to examining multi-variable (i.e., covariate) associations between multiple metabolites and specialty-dependent variables of interest (e.g., using multiple regression). Without this shift, clear interpretation of associations of 1H-MRS metabolites with specialty-dependent variables of interest may not be possible.",

Here, we investigated the kinetics, avidity and cross-reactivity of serum antibodies and MBCs in 155 SARS-CoV-2 infected and vaccinated individuals over a 16-month timeframe. SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs and serum antibodies reached steady-state titers with comparable kinetics in infected and vaccinated individuals. Whereas MBCs of infected individuals targeted both pre- and postfusion Spike (S), most vaccine-elicited MBCs were specific for prefusion S, consistent with the use of prefusion-stabilized S in mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, a large fraction of MBCs recognizing postfusion S cross-reacted with human betacoronaviruses. The avidity of MBC-derived and serum antibodies increased over time resulting in enhanced resilience to viral escape by SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 sub-lineages, albeit only partially for BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages. Overall, the maturation of high-affinity and broadly-reactive MBCs provides the basis for effective recall responses to future SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "The currently expanding monkeypox epidemic is caused by a subclade IIb descendant of a monkeypox virus (MPXV) lineage traced back to Nigeria in 1971. In contrast to monkeypox cases caused by clade I and subclade IIa MPXV, the prognosis of current cases is generally favorable, but person-to-person transmission is much more efficient. MPXV evolution is driven by selective pressure from hosts and loss of virus-host interacting genes. However, there is no satisfactory genetic explanation using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the observed increased MPXV transmissibility. We hypothesized that key genomic changes may occur in the genomes low-complexity regions (LCRs), which are highly challenging to sequence and have been dismissed as uninformative. Using a combination of highly sensitive techniques, we determined a first high-quality MPXV genome sequence of a representative of the current epidemic with LCRs resolved at unprecedented accuracy. This effort revealed significant variation in short-tandem repeats within LCRs. We demonstrate that LCR entropy in the MPXV genome is significantly higher than that of SNPs and that LCRs are not randomly distributed. In silico analyses indicate that expression, translation, stability, or function of MPXV orthologous poxvirus genes (OPGs) 153, 204, and 208 could be affected in a manner consistent with the established \"genomic accordion\" evolutionary strategies of orthopoxviruses. Consequently, we posit that genomic studies focusing on phenotypic MPXV clade-/subclade-/lineage-/strain differences should change their focus to the study of LCR variability instead of SNP variability.",

    "abstract": "Antisense technology is emerging as potential therapeutics against lethal infections. Basically, Antisense-mRNA complex inhibits the protein translation of pathogens and thus it is used for treatment. Based on previous online tools and literatures and difficulties for designing antisense template, finding high conserved regions from large number of long sequences, by taking all those factors in consideration, we proposed new innovative offline target simulation methods i.e. Deletion of unwanted region from viral sequence alignment (DURVA) and Most frequent region (MFR) for designing and developing antisense template from large number of long sequence or genomic data. Based on current pandemic crisis and long genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, we chose coronavirus for simulation. Initially, we hypothesized that DURVA-MFR would find stable region from large annotated sequencing data. As per Chan et.al. guidelines for antisense designing and development, we designed couple of algorithms and python scripts to process the data of approximately 30kbp sequence length and 1Gb file size in short turnaround time. The steps involved were as: 1) Simplifying whole genome sequence in single line; 2) Deletion of unwanted region from Virus sequence alignment(DURVA); 3)Most frequent antisense target region(MFR) and 4)Designing and development of antisense template. This simulation method is identifying most frequent regions between 20-30bp long, GC count[&ge;]10. Our study concluded that targets were highly identical with large population and similar with high number of remaining sequences. In addition, designed antisense sequences were stable and each sequence is having tighter binding with targets. After studying each parameter, here we suggested that our proposed method would be helpful for finding best antisense against all present and upcoming lethal infection.The initial design of this logic was published in Indian Patent Office Journal No.08/2021withApplication number202121005964A.\n\nSimple summaryThe antisense development is state of the art for modern therapeutics. There are number of online soft-wares and open sources for designing of antisense template. But all other tools did not consider frequency as major factor for designing antisense. Also; all sources excepting our simulation approach does not process large file or long sequences. Therefore; we designed an offline innovative simulation method which deletes the unwanted region from sequences and stores the data which are fulfilled antisense criteria. Further; the calculation of frequency from these short listed target regions; the most frequent region is desire antisense target and further antisense template will be designed according to Watson-Crick model. This article explained all information about how our new approach is best for designing antisense template against SARS-CoV-2 and many lethal infectious viruses etc.",

    "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a promising new class of agents that have demonstrated efficacy in treating various cancers, particularly those that carry BRCA1/2 mutations. The cancer associated BRCA1/2 mutations disrupt DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR). PARP inhibitors (PARPis) have been applied to trigger synthetic lethality in BRCA1/2-mutated cancer cells by promoting the accumulation of toxic DSBs. Unfortunately, resistance to PARPis is common and can occur through multiple mechanisms, including the restoration of HR and/or the stabilization of replication forks. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PARPi resistance, we conducted an unbiased CRISPR-pooled genome-wide library screen to identify new genes whose deficiency confers resistance to the PARPi olaparib. Our study revealed that ZNF251, a transcription factor, is a novel gene whose haploinsufficiency confers PARPi resistance in multiple breast and ovarian cancer lines harboring BRCA1 mutations. Mechanistically, we discovered that ZNF251 haploinsufficiency leads to constitutive stimulation of DNA-PKcs-dependent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DSBs and DNA-PKcs-mediated fork protection in BRCA1-mutated cancer cells (BRCA1mut+ZNF251KD). Moreover, we demonstrated that DNA-PKcs inhibitors can restore PARPi sensitivity in BRCA1mut+ZNF251KD cells ex vivo and in vivo. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying PARPi resistance and highlight the unexpected role of DNA-PKcs in this phenomenon.\n\nSignificance statementOur study identified a novel gene ZNF251 which haploinsufficiency causes the resistance to PARP inhibitors in breast cancer cells and pinpointed a novel mechanism of the resistance.",

    "abstract": "Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants play critical role in the infection and transmission through its interaction with hACE2 receptor. Prior findings using molecular docking and biomolecular studies reported varied findings on the difference in the interactions among the spike variants with hACE2 receptor. Hence, it is a prerequisite to understand these interactions in a more precise manner. To this end, firstly, we performed ELISA with trimeric spike proteins of Wild (Wuhan Hu-1), Delta, C.1.2 and Omicron variants. Further, to study the interactions in a more specific manner by mimicking the natural infection, we developed hACE2 receptor expressing HEK-293T cell line and evaluated binding efficiencies of the variants and competitive binding of spike variants with D614G spike pseudotyped virus. In lines with the existing findings, we observed that Omicron had higher binding efficiency compared to Delta in both ELISA and Cellular models. Intriguingly, we found that cellular models could differentiate the subtle differences between the closely related C.1.2 and Delta in their binding to hACE2. From the analysis in receptor binding domain (RBD) revealed that a single common modification, N501Y, present in both Omicron and C.1.2 is driving the enhanced spike binding to the receptor and showed two-fold superior competitive binding than Delta. Our study using cellular model provides a precise method to evaluate the binding interactions between spike sub-lineages to hACE2 receptors and signifies the role of single common modification N501Y in RBD towards imparting superior binding efficiencies. Our approach would be instrumental in understanding the disease progression and developing therapeutics.\n\nAuthor SummarySpike proteins of evolving SARS-CoV2 variants demonstrated their signature binding to hACE2 receptor, in turn contributed to driving the infection and transmission. Prior studies to scale the binding efficiencies between the spike variant and the receptor had consensus in distinct variants, but discrepancies in the closely related ones. To this end, we compared spike variants-receptor interactions with ELISA, from cells expressing hACE2 receptor. Intriguingly, we found that cellular models could differentiate the subtle differences between the closely related C.1.2 and Delta in their binding to hACE2. More importantly, competitive binding studies in presence of pseudovirus, demonstrated that a single common modification, N501Y, present in both Omicron and C.1.2 showed two fold superior competitive binding than Delta. Collectively, our study suggests a precise approach to evaluate the binding interactions between spike sub-lineages to hACE2 receptor.

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, the conserved kinase Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) negatively regulates DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and plays a central role in DSB repair. Here, by using cytogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that ATM also plays an essential role in protecting meiotic chromosome integrity in Arabidopsis thaliana at extreme high temperature. We determined the chromosome localization patterns of DSB formation proteins SPO11-1 and DFO during prophase I, both of which were disturbed by heat stress. Evaluation of the number of RAD51, DMC1, SPO11-1 and DFO protein foci in meiocytes of Arabidopsis atm mutant clarifies that ATM does not mediate the heat-induced reduction in DSB formation. Interestingly, meiotic spread analysis showed that chromosome fragmentation level was significantly increased in atm but was lowered in the mre11 and mre11 atm mutants under high temperature, indicating that ATM-dependent meiotic chromosome integrity at high temperature relies on the functional MRE1-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex. Moreover, contrary to the rad51 and mnd1 mutants, which exhibited enhanced meiotic chromosome integrity under heat stress, the rad51 atm and mnd1 atm mutants retained high levels of chromosome fragmentation at extreme high temperature. Furthermore, heat stress reduced chromosome fragmentation level in the syn1 and syn1 atm mutants. Collectively, these data suggest that ATM-mediated DSB repair is required for meiotic genome stability in plants at extreme high temperature, which possibly acts in a RAD51-independent manner and relies on functional chromosome axis.",

    "abstract": "Enterococci are opportunistic, potentially life-threatening pathogens of humans that are difficult to manage due to antimicrobial resistance. Historically, enterococci entering the food-chain through livestock have been viewed as a likely source of antimicrobial resistance in humans. Australian human-derived clinical enterococci have a propensity to be resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials including vancomycin. Recent Australian studies involving pigs and chicken have virtually excluded these species as reservoirs of infection for resistant enterococci in humans. However, the Australian bovine population has not been similarly assessed. This study investigates the antimicrobial resistance profiles of enterococci from Australian cattle and the phylogenetic relationship between E. faecium isolated from cattle and human sepsis cases. Minimum inhibitory concentration assays were performed for E. faecium (n=343), E. faecalis (n=92), and E. hirae (n=284) against a panel of 15 antimicrobials. The majority of isolates were sensitive to all tested antimicrobials. Erythromycin resistance was most prevalent for E. faecium isolates (18.7%), daptomycin for E. faecalis (12.1%) and tetracycline for E. hirae (13.3%). Phenotypically, 1 E. faecalis was resistant to vancomycin and 9 were resistant to linezolid (E. faecium n=4, E. faecalis n=2, E. hirae n=3) but this was not confirmed with any know genotype. A subset of 67 E. faecium isolates selected for comparative phylogenetic analysis revealed that bovine isolates clustered with other livestock-derived and van-negative human isolates. In conclusion, there is a low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst enterococci from Australian cattle which are unlikely to be precursor strains to vancomycin-resistant strains currently circulating in Australian hospitals.\n\nImportanceEnterococci resistant to critically important antimicrobials such as vancomycin and linezolid are difficult to manage in health care settings. Historically, there has been the belief that livestock can act as a reservoir of resistance for human infections. Previous studies in poultry and pork have demonstrated that isolates derived from these livestock are unlikely to be precursor strains for currently circulating vancomycin resistant-Enterococci causing infection in humans. To date, there has been no study looking at the genetic similarity of bovine derived Enterococci and the relationship to human pathogenic strains. In this study we performed phenotypic and genotypic characterization of bovine derived Enterococci along with comparative phylogenetic analysis with other livestock derived and human sepsis derived E. faecium isolates. We found that while non-vancomycin resistant strain sharing occurs between hosts, cattle are unlikely to be precursor strains for vancomycin resistant human E. faecium infections.",

To understand the regulatory mechanisms of these phenotypes, single cell transcriptome analysis of E11.5 H2CKO hearts was performed revealing a number of disrupted endocardial regulatory pathways. Utilizing HAND2 DNA occupancy data, we identify several HAND2-dependent enhancers, including two endothelial enhancers for the sheer-stress master regulator, KLF2. A 1.8kb enhancer located 50kb upstream of the Klf2 transcriptional start site imparts specific endothelial/endocardial expression within the vasculature and endocardium. This enhancer is HAND2-dependent for ventricular endocardium expression but HAND2-independent for Klf2 vascular and valve expression. Deletion of this Klf2 enhancer reveals reduced Klf2 expression within ventricular endocardium.

    "abstract": "Receptor-ligand interactions play essential signaling roles within intercellular contact regions. This is particularly important within the context of the immune synapse where protein communication at the surface of physically interacting T cells and antigen-presenting cells regulate downstream immune signaling responses. To identify protein microenvironments within immunological synapses, we combined a flavin-dependent photocatalytic labeling strategy with quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Using -PD-L1 or -PD-1 single-domain antibody (VHH)-based photocatalyst targeting modalities, we profiled protein microenvironments within the intercellular region of an immune synapse-forming co-culture system. In addition to enrichment of both PD-L1 and PD-1 with either targeting modality, we also observed enrichment of both known immune synapse residing receptor-ligand pairs and surface proteins, as well as previously unknown synapse residing proteins.",

    "abstract": "Host mucosal barriers possess an arsenal of defense molecules to maintain mucosal health. In addition to well-established defense molecules such as antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulins, a subset of extracellular host-derived small RNAs (sRNAs) also exhibits antimicrobial functions in a cross-kingdom fashion. We recently uncovered the sRNA-mediated crosstalk between human normal oral keratinocytes and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), an opportunistic oral pathobiont with increasing implications in extra-oral diseases. Notably, when challenged with Fn, oral keratinocytes released Fn-targeting tRNA-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs), an emerging class of noncoding sRNAs with diverse functions in gene regulation. Additionally, synthetic mimics of the Fn-targeting tsRNAs exhibited highly selective antimicrobial activity against Fn. However, excess synthetic tsRNAs (in the micromolar range) were required to achieve growth inhibition, which limits their potential as antimicrobials. Here, we chemically modify nucleotides of the anti-Fn tsRNAs, termed MOD-tsRNAs, and demonstrate their species- and sequence-specific inhibition in the nanomolar range in various Fn type strains and clinical tumor isolates. In contrast, the same MOD-tsRNAs do not inhibit two representative oral bacteria, Porphoromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Streptococcus mitis (Sm). Additionally, MOD-tsRNAs are internalized by different Fn strains while exhibiting minimal uptake by Pg and Sm. Further RNA sequencing and affinity pull-down assays implicate MOD-tsRNAs as potential ribosome-targeting antimicrobials against Fn. Taken together, our work provides a framework to target opportunistic pathobionts through co-opting host-derived extracellular tsRNAs, whose potential applications may have been limited by their intrinsic instability as well as our limited understanding of the inhibition mechanism.",

    "abstract": "1.Wastewater (WW) treatment in anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBR) is considered more sustainable than in their aerobic counterparts. However, outputs from AnMBR are mixed methane and carbon dioxide gas streams as well as ammonium- (N) and phosphate- (P) containing waters. Using AnMBR outputs as inputs for photoautotrophic algal cultivation can strip the CO2 and remove N and P from effluent which feed algal biomass generation. Recent advances in algal engineering have generated strains for concomitant high-value side product generation in addition to biomass, although only shown in heavily domesticated, lab-adapted strains. Here, investigated whether such a strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii could be grown directly in AnMBR effluent with CO2 at concentrations found in its off-gas. The domesticated strain was found to proliferate over bacteria in the non-sterile effluent, consume N and P to levels that meet general discharge or reuse limits, and tolerate cultivation in modelled (extreme) outdoor environmental conditions prevalent along the central Red Sea coast. High-value co-product milking was then demonstrated, up to 837 g L-1 culture in 96 h, in addition to algal biomass production, [~]2.4 g CDW L-1 in 96 h, directly in effluents. This is the first demonstration of a combined bio-process that employs a heavily engineered algal strain to enhance the product generation potentials from AnMBR effluent treatment. This study shows it is possible to convert waste into value through use of engineered algae while also improve wastewater treatment economics through co-product generation.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510234v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a7e325org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@31c0a2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5deea8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df672b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Past decades have witnessed swine as the common sources of Salmonella enterica infections. Nevertheless, how Salmonella enterica entered food supply chains and caused foodborne outbreaks remains to be excluded. By analysis of 718 publicly Salmonella enterica isolates, we demonstrated that Euramerica act as the centralized sourcing for the global spread of Salmonella enterica which origins at the pinnacle of pork production. Specifically, the lineage of Salmonella Choleraesuis lend geographic support for their dispersal from Euramerica centralized origins. We used the generalized linear model to quantify the relative contributions of potential explanatory variables to the global transmission of Salmonella enterica. The global pork trade may act as the key driver for the geographic dispersal of Salmonella enterica over the world. In addition, the application of antimicrobials over the past 80 years may also exert a large impact on the evolution of Salmonella enterica genomics. Taken together, our findings provided the global lineage evolution of Salmonella enterica. Further investigation and potential intervention are needed to identify the global spread of Salmonella enterica over the world.",

    "abstract": "The versatility of cellular response arises from the communication, or crosstalk, of signaling pathways in a complex network of signaling and transcriptional regulatory interactions. Understanding the various mechanisms underlying crosstalk on a global scale requires untargeted computational approaches. We present a network-based statistical approach, MuXTalk, that uses high-dimensional edges called multilinks to model the unique ways in which signaling and regulatory interactions can interface. We demonstrate that the signaling-regulatory interface is located primarily in the intermediary region between signaling pathways where crosstalk occurs, and that multilinks can differentiate between distinct signaling-transcriptional mechanisms. Using statistically over-represented multilinks as proxies of crosstalk, we predict crosstalk among 60 signaling pathways, expanding currently available crosstalk databases by more than five-fold. MuXTalk surpasses existing methods in terms of prediction performance, identifies additions to manual curation efforts, and pinpoints potential mediators of crosstalk for each prediction. Moreover, it accommodates the inherent context-dependence of crosstalk, allowing future applications to cell type- and disease-specific crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Human-specific cognitive abilities depend on information processing in the cerebral cortex, where neurons are significantly larger and sparser compared to rodents. We found that, in synaptically-connected layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3 PCs), soma-to-soma signal propagation delay is similar in humans and rodents. Thus, to compensate for the increase in neurons size, membrane potential changes must propagate faster in human axons and/or dendrites. Dual somato-dendritic and somato-axonal patch recordings show that action potentials (APs) propagation speed is similar in human and rat axons, but the forward propagation of the EPSPs and the back-propagating APs are [~]1.7-fold faster in human dendrites. Faithful biophysical models of human and rat L2/3 PCs, combined with pharmacological manipulations of membrane properties, showed that the larger dendritic diameter, combined with differences in cable properties, underlie the accelerated signal propagation in human cortical circuits. The implication for information processing in the human brain are discussed.\n\nTeaserLarge human cortical neurons increase dendrite diameter and signal propagation speed for fast cell-to-cell communication.",

    "abstract": "Focusing on a single source within a complex auditory scene is challenging. M/EEG-based auditory attention detection allows to detect which stream, within a set of multiple concurrent streams, an individual is attending to. The high inter-individual variability in the AAD performance is most often attributed to physiological factors and signal to noise ratio of neural data. Here we address the hypothesis that cognitive factors and in particular sustained attention, WM and attentional inhibition, may also partly explain the variability in AAD performance, because they support the cognitive processes required when listening to complex auditory scenes. Here, we chose a particularly challenging auditory scene, by presenting dichotically polyphonic classical piano excerpts lasting one minute each. Two different excerpts were presented simultaneously in each ear. Forty-one participants, with different degrees of musical expertise, listened to these complex auditory scenes focussing on one ear while we recorded the EEG. Participants also completed several tasks assessing executive functions. As expected, attended stimuli were better decoded than unattended stimuli. Importantly, attentional inhibition ability did explain around 10% of the reconstruction accuracy and around 8% of the classification accuracy. No other cognitive function was a significant predictor of reconstruction or of classification accuracies. No clear effect of musical expertise was found on reconstruction and classification performances. In conclusion, cognitive factors seem to impact the robustness of the auditory representation and hence the performance of neural based decoding approaches. Taking advantage of this relation could be useful to improve next-generation hearing aids.",

The phenomenon of covert inner speech implies a functional independence of speech content and motor production. However, it remains unclear how a flexible mapping between speech content and production is achieved on the neural level. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans performing a rule-based vocalization task. On each trial, vocalization content (one of two vowels) and production form (overt or covert) were instructed independently. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found robust neural information about vocalization content and production, mostly originating from speech areas of the left hemisphere. Production signals dynamically transformed upon presentation of the content cue, whereas content signals remained largely stable throughout the trial. In sum, our results show dissociable neural representations of vocalization content and production in the human brain and provide new insights into the neural dynamics underlying human vocalization.",

    "abstract": "Inter-subject modeling of cognitive processes has been a challenging task due to large individual variability in brain structure and function. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a potential way to project subject-specific neural responses onto a common representational space by effectively combining local and distributed brain activity through connectome-based constraints. Here we provide in-depth interpretations of biologically-constrained GNNs (BGNNs) that reach state-of-the-art performance in several decoding tasks and reveal inter-subject aligned neural representations underpinning cognitive processes. Specifically, the model not only segregates brain responses at different stages of cognitive tasks, e.g. motor preparation and motor execution, but also uncovers functional gradients in neural representations, e.g. a gradual progression of visual working memory (VWM) from sensory processing to cognitive control and towards behavioral abstraction. Moreover, the multilevel representations of VWM exhibit better inter-subject alignment in brain responses, higher decoding of cognitive states, and strong phenotypic and genetic correlations with individual behavioral performance. Our work demonstrates that biologically constrained deep-learning models have the potential towards both cognitive and biological fidelity in cognitive modeling, and open new avenues to interpretable functional gradients of brain cognition in a wide range of cognitive neuroscience questions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBGNN improves inter-subject alignment in task-evoked responses and promotes brain decoding\nC_LIO_LIBGNN captures functional gradients of brain cognition, transforming from sensory processing to cognition to representational abstraction.\nC_LIO_LIBGNNs with diffusion or functional connectome constraints better predict human behaviors compared to other graph architectures\nC_LI\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=181 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510241v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (71K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b34a13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c45ca2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9db47dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b4916d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Multilevel representational learning of cognitive processes using BGNN",

    "abstract": "When we memorize multiple words simultaneously, semantic relatedness among those words assists memory. For example, the information of \"apple\", \"banana\" and \"orange\" will be connected via a common concept of \"fruits\" and become easy to retain and recall. Neural mechanisms underlying this semantic integration in verbal working memory remain unclear. Here I used electroencephalography (EEG) and investigated neural signals when healthy human participants memorized five nouns semantically related (Sem trial) or not (NonSem trial). The regularity of oscillatory signals (8 - 30 Hz) during the retention period was found to be lower in NonSem than Sem trials, indicating that memorizing words unrelated to each other induced a non-harmonic (irregular) waveform in the temporal cortex. These results suggest that (i) semantic features of a word are retained as a set of neural oscillations at specific frequencies and (ii) memorizing words sharing a common semantic feature produces harmonic brain responses through a resonance or integration (sharing) of the oscillatory signals.",

    "abstract": "The food pathogen Campylobacter jejuni both colonizes the lower intestines of poultry and infects the lower intestines of humans. The lower intestines of both poultry and humans are also home to a wide range of commensal organisms which compete with an organism like C. jejuni for space and resources. The commensal organisms are believed to protect humans against infection by pathogens of the digestive tract like C. jejuni. The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate is a metabolite commonly produced by commensal organisms within both the poultry and human digestive tract. We investigated the affect that physiologically relevant concentrations of butyrate have on C. jejnui. Butyrate at concentrations of 5 and 20 mM negatively impacted C. jejuni motility and attachment. These two traits are believed important for C. jejunis ability to infect the lower intestines of humans. Additionally, 20 mM butyrate concentrations were observed to influence the expression of a range of different Campylobacter proteins. Constitutive expression of one of these proteins, LysR, within a C. jejuni strain partially lessened the negative influence butyrate had on the bacterias motility.\n\nImportanceResearch studies on the short chain fatty acid, butyrate, have produced evidence for it both negatively and positively impacting Campylobacter jejunis colonization of poultry or infection of the human intestinal tract. There is significant value in clarifying if butyrate has potential as an intervention agent capable of interfering in the virulence process of C. jejuni. The results presented, show that butyrate, at physiological levels, negatively impacts C. jejuni motility and attachment, two important factors in the virulence process. Additionally, a proteomic analysis of butyrates influence on C. jejuni, identified that the expression of the transcriptional factor, LysR, was repressed in the presence of butyrate. Overexpression of the lysR gene restored some motility in the presence of butyrate suggesting this factor had a positive influence on the flagella necessary for C. jejunis movement.",
