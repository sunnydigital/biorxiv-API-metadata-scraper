    "abstract": "Naturally produced peptides (<100 amino acids) are important regulators of physiology, development, and metabolism. Recent studies have predicted that thousands of peptides may be translated from transcripts containing small open reading frames (smORFs). Here, we describe two peptides in Drosophila encoded by conserved smORFs, Sloth1 and Sloth2. These peptides are translated from the same bicistronic transcript and share sequence similarities, suggesting that they encode paralogs. Yet, Sloth1 and Sloth2 are not functionally redundant, and loss of either peptide causes animal lethality, reduced neuronal function, impaired mitochondrial function, and neurodegeneration. We provide evidence that Sloth1/2 are highly expressed in neurons, imported to mitochondria, and regulate mitochondrial complex III assembly. These results suggest that phenotypic analysis of smORF genes in Drosophila can provide a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly characterized class of genes.",

    "abstract": "Detecting epistatic drivers of human phenotypes remains a challenge. Traditional approaches use regression to sequentially test multiplicative interaction terms involving single pairs of genetic variants. For higher-order interactions and genome-wide large-scale data, this strategy is computationally intractable. Moreover, multiplicative terms used in regression modeling may not capture the form of biological interactions. Building on the Predictability, Computability, Stability (PCS) framework, we introduce the epiTree pipeline to extract higher-order interactions from genomic data using tree-based models. The epiTree pipeline first selects a set of variants derived from tissue-specific estimates of gene expression. Next, it uses iterative random forests (iRF) to search training data for candidate Boolean interactions (pairwise and higher-order). We derive significance tests from interactions by simulating Boolean tree-structured null (no epistasis) and alternative (epistasis) distributions on hold-out test data. Finally, our pipeline computes PCS epistasis p-values that evaluate the stability of improvement in prediction accuracy via bootstrap sampling on the test set. We validate the epiTree pipeline using the phenotype of red-hair from the UK Biobank, where several genes are known to demonstrate epistatic interactions. epiTree recovers both previously reported and novel interactions, which represent forms of non-linearities not captured by logistic regression models. Additionally, epiTree suggests interactions between genes such as PKHD1 and XPOTP1, which are unlinked to MC1R, as novel candidate interactions associated with the red hair phenotype. Last but not least, we find that individual Boolean or tree-based epistasis models generally provide higher prediction accuracy than classical logistic regression.",

    "abstract": "The release of peptide hormones is predominantly regulated by a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c). To trigger exocytosis, Ca2+ ions enter the cytosol from intracellular Ca2+ stores or from the extracellular space. The molecular events of late stages of exocytosis, and their dependence on [Ca2+]c, were extensively described in isolated single cells from various endocrine glands. Notably less work has been done on endocrine cells in situ to address the heterogeneity of [Ca2+]c events contributing to a collective functional response of a gland. For this beta cell collectives in a pancreatic islet are particularly well suited as they are the smallest, experimentally manageable functional unit, where [Ca2+]c dynamics can be simultaneously assessed on both cellular and collective level. Here we measured [Ca2+]c transients across all relevant timescales, from a sub-second to a minute time range, using high-resolution imaging with low-affinity Ca2+ sensor. We quantified the recordings with a novel computational framework for semi-automatic image segmentation and [Ca2+]c event identification. Our results demonstrate that under physiological conditions the duration of [Ca2+]c events is variable, and segregated into 3 reproducible modes, sub-second, second and tens of seconds time range, and are a result of a progressive temporal summation of the shortest events. Using pharmacological tools we show that activation of intracellular Ca2+ receptors is both sufficient and necessary for glucose-dependent [Ca2+]c oscillations in beta cell collectives, and that a subset of [Ca2+]c events could be triggered even in the absence of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. In aggregate, our experimental and analytical platform was able to readily address the involvement of intracellular Ca2+ receptors in shaping the heterogeneity of [Ca2+]c responses in collectives of endocrine cells in situ.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection acts on phenotypes constructed over development, which raises the question of how development affects evolution. Classic evolutionary theory indicates that development affects evolution by modulating the genetic covariation upon which selection acts, thus affecting genetic constraints. However, whether genetic constraints are relative, thus diverting adaptation from the direction of steepest fitness ascent, or absolute, thus blocking adaptation in certain directions, remains uncertain. This limits understanding of long-term evolution of developmentally constructed phenotypes. Here we formulate a general tractable mathematical framework that integrates age progression, explicit development (i.e., the construction of the phenotype across life subject to developmental constraints), and evolutionary dynamics, thus describing the evolutionary developmental (evo-devo) dynamics. The framework yields simple equations that can be arranged in a layered structure that we call the evo-devo process, whereby five core elementary components generate all equations including those mechanistically describing genetic covariation and the evo-devo dynamics. The framework recovers evolutionary dynamic equations in gradient form and describes the evolution of genetic covariation from the evolution of genotype, phenotype, environment, and mutational covariation. This shows that genotypic and phenotypic evolution must be followed simultaneously to yield a dynamically sufficient description of long-term phenotypic evolution in gradient form, such that evolution described as the climbing of a fitness landscape occurs in \"geno-phenotype\" space. Genetic constraints in geno-phenotype space are necessarily absolute because the phenotype is related to the genotype by development. Thus, the long-term evolutionary dynamics of developed phenotypes is strongly non-standard: (1) evolutionary equilibria are either absent or infinite in number and depend on genetic covariation and hence on development; (2) developmental constraints determine the admissible evolutionary path and hence which evolutionary equilibria are admissible; and (3) evolutionary outcomes occur at admissible evolutionary equilibria, which do not generally occur at fitness landscape peaks in geno-phenotype space, but at peaks in the admissible evolutionary path where \"total genotypic selection\" vanishes if exogenous plastic response vanishes and mutational variation exists in all directions of genotype space. Hence, selection and development jointly define the evolutionary outcomes if absolute mutational constraints and exogenous plastic response are absent, rather than the outcomes being defined only by selection. Moreover, our framework provides formulas for the sensitivities of a recurrence and an alternative method to dynamic optimization (i.e., dynamic programming or optimal control) to identify evolutionary outcomes in models with developmentally dynamic traits. These results show that development has major evolutionary effects.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe formulate a framework integrating evolutionary and developmental dynamics.\nC_LIO_LIWe derive equations describing the evolutionary dynamics of traits considering their developmental process.\nC_LIO_LIThis yields a description of the evo-devo process in terms of closed-form formulas that are simple and insightful, including for genetic covariance matrices.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) is a vital component of the interphase nucleus; yet its distribution and role in the three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and function remain poorly understood. Here, we map caRNAs spatial distribution on the 3D genome in human embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, and myelogenous leukemia cells. These maps reveal several characteristics of caRNA distribution. caRNA is preferentially associated with its transcription site and up to several megabases of flanking genomic sequence. Furthermore, topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries insulate RNA-DNA contacts. Abolishment or creation of a TAD boundary by genomic editing changed the boundarys ability to insulate RNA-DNA contacts, demonstrating an impact of the 3D genome structure on the distribution of caRNA. Conversely, depletion of caRNA weakens TAD boundaries. We characterize caRNA based on their target genomic sequence into loop-anchor-associated RNA and those associated with any genomic sequence between loop anchors (between-anchor caRNA). Between-anchor caRNA suppresses chromatin loops, especially those with convergent CTCF binding sites in their loop anchors. These data suggest the indispensable roles of caRNA in the 3D genome organization.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscientific analyses balance between capturing the brains complexity and expressing that complexity in meaningful and understandable ways. Here we present a novel approach that fully characterizes neural network activity and does so by uniquely transforming raw signals into easily interpretable and biologically relevant metrics of network behavior. We first prove that third-order, or triple, correlation describes network activity in its entirety using the triple correlation uniqueness (TCU) theorem. Triple correlation quantifies the relationships among three events separated by spatial and temporal lags, which are triplet motifs. Classifying these motifs by their event sequencing leads to fourteen qualitatively distinct motif classes that embody well-studied network behaviors such as synchrony, feedback, feedforward, convergence, and divergence. Within these motif classes, the summed triple correlations provide novel metrics of network behavior, as well as being inclusive of commonly used analyses. We demonstrate the power of this approach on a range of networks with increasingly obscured signals, from ideal noiseless simulations to noisy experimental data. This approach can be easily applied to any recording modality, so existing neural datasets are ripe for reanalysis. Triple correlation is an accessible signal processing tool with a solid theoretical foundation capable of revealing previously elusive information within recordings of neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Using an eight-parent Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population we investigated how variation at circadian clock-associated genes contributes to the regulation of heading date in UK and European winter wheat varieties. We identified homoeologues of EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) as candidates for the Earliness per se (Eps) D1 and B1 loci in field conditions. We confirmed that a SNP within the coding region of TaELF3-B1 is a candidate polymorphism underlying the Eps-B1 locus. We found that a reported deletion at the Eps-D1 locus encompassing TaELF3-D1, is instead a novel allele that lies within an introgression region containing an inversion relative to the Chinese Spring D genome. Using T. turgidum cv. Kronos carrying loss of function alleles of TtELF3 we show that ELF3 does regulate heading by demonstrating that the loss of a single ELF3 homoeologue was sufficient to alter heading date. These studies demonstrated that ELF3 forms part of the circadian oscillator but loss of all homoeologues was required to affect circadian rhythms. Similarly, loss of functional LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) in T. aestivum, an orthologue of a protein partner of Arabidopsis ELF3, severely disrupted circadian rhythms. ELF3 and LUX transcripts are not co-expressed at dusk suggesting the structure of the wheat circadian oscillator might differ to that of Arabidopsis. Our demonstration that alteration to ELF3 homoeologues can affect heading date separate from effects on the circadian oscillator suggests a role for ELF3 in cereal photoperiodic responses that could be selected for, without pleiotropic deleterious alterations to circadian rhythms.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) is part of a basic feedback circuit, regulating cortical function, such as voluntary movement control, via their influence on thalamocortical projections. BG disorders, namely Parkinsons disease (PD), characterized by the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra, involve the progressive loss of motor functions. At the present, PD is incurable. Converging evidence suggests the onset of PD-specific pathology prior to the appearance of classical motor signs. This latent phase of neurodegeneration in PD is of particular relevance in developing more effective therapies by intervening at the earliest stages of disease. Therefore, a key challenge in PD research is to identify and validate markers for the preclinical and prodromal stage of the illness.\n\nWe propose a mechanistic neurocomputational model of the BG at mesoscopic scale to investigate the behavior of the simulated neural system after several degrees of lesion of the substantia nigra, with the aim of possibly evaluating which is the smallest lesion compromising motor learning. In other words, we developed a working framework for the analysis of theoretical early-stage PD. While simulations in healthy conditions confirm the key role of dopamine in learning, in pathological conditions networks predict that there may exist abnormalities of motor learning process for physiological alterations in the BG which do not yet involve the presence of symptoms typical of the clinical diagnosis. Our model may account for the discovery of markers for an early diagnosis of the disease and give directions for developing novel noninvasive support systems.",

Here we show that combined LSD1 and FLT3 inhibition induces synergistic cell death in FLT3-mutant AML. Multi-omic profiling revealed that the drug combination disrupts STAT5, LSD1, and GFI1 binding at the MYC blood super-enhancer, suppressing super-enhancer activation as well as MYC expression and activity. The drug combination simultaneously results in the accumulation of repressive H3K9me1 methylation, an LSD1 substrate, at MYC target genes. We validated these findings in 72 primary AML samples with the nearly every sample demonstrating synergistic responses to the drug combination.

    "abstract": "For enumerating viable bacteria, traditional dilution plating to count colony forming units (CFU) has always been the preferred method in microbiology owing to its simplicity, albeit laborious and time-consuming. Similar CFU counts can be obtained by quantifying growing micro-colonies in conjunction with the perks of a microscope. Here, we employed a simple method of five microliter spotting of differently diluted bacterial culture multiple times on a single Petri dish followed by finding out CFU by counting micro-colonies using a phase-contrast microscope. In this method, the CFU of an Escherichia coli culture can be estimated within a four-hour period. Further, within a ten-hour period, CFU in a culture of Ralstonia solanacearum, a bacterium with a generation time of around 2 h, can be estimated. The CFU number determined by micro-colonies observed is comparable with that obtained by the dilution plating method. Micro-colonies number observed in the early hours of growth (2 h in case of E. coli and 8 h in case of R. solanacearum) were found to remain consistent at later hours, though there was a noticeable increase in the size of the colonies. It suggested that micro-colonies observed in the early hours indeed represent the bacterial number in the culture. Practical applications to this counting method were employed in studying the rifampicin-resistant mutation rate as well as performing the fluctuation test in E. coli. The method described here results in a 90% reduction of labour, time and resources. Thus, the method is likely to be adopted by many microbiologists in their routine laboratory research.",

To test this hypothesis, we created a Padi2/Padi4 double knockout (DKO) mouse model and tested these mice along with wild-type FVB/NJ (WT) and both strains of SKO mice for a range of reproductive defects.\n\nResultsControlled breeding trials found that male DKO mice appeared to take longer to have their first litter than WT controls. This tendency was maintained when these mice were mated to either DKO and WT females. Additionally, unsexed 2-day old DKO pups and male DKO weanlings both weighed significantly less than their WT counterparts, took significantly longer than WT males to reach puberty, and had consistently lower serum testosterone levels. Furthermore, 90-day old adult DKO males had smaller testes than WT males with increased rates of germ cell apoptosis.\n\nConclusionsThe Padi2/Padi4 DKO mouse model provides a new tool for investigating PAD function and outcomes from our studies provide the first in vivo evidence linking PADs with hormone signaling.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the firing behaviour of motoneuron (MN) pools during human voluntary muscle contractions is currently limited to electrophysiological findings from animal experiments extrapolated to humans, mathematical models of MN pools not validated for human data, and experimental results obtained from decomposition of electromyographical (EMG) signals. These approaches are limited in accuracy or provide information on only small partitions of the MN population. Here, we propose a method based on the combination of high-density EMG (HDEMG) data and realistic modelling for predicting the behaviour of entire pools of motoneurons in humans. The method builds on a physiologically realistic model of a MN pool which predicts, from the experimental spike trains of a smaller number of individual MNs identified from decomposed HDEMG signals, the unknown recruitment and firing activity of the remaining unidentified MNs in the complete MN pool. The MN pool model is described as a cohort of single-compartment leaky fire- and-integrate (LIF) models of MNs scaled by a physiologically realistic distribution of MN electrophysiological properties and driven by a spinal synaptic input, both derived from decomposed HDEMG data. The MN spike trains and effective neural drive to muscle, predicted with this method, have been successfully validated experimentally. A representative application of the method in MN-driven neuromuscular modelling is also presented. The proposed approach provides a validated tool for neuroscientists, experimentalists, and modelers to infer the firing activity of MNs that cannot be observed experimentally, investigate the neuromechanics of human MN pools, support future experimental investigations, and advance neuromuscular modelling for investigating the neural strategies controlling human voluntary contractions.\n\nAuthor SummaryOur experimental understanding of the firing behaviour of motoneuron (MN) pools during human voluntary muscle contractions is currently limited to the observation of small samples of active MNs obtained from EMG decomposition. EMG decomposition therefore provides an important but incomplete description of the role of individual MNs in the firing activity of the complete MN pool, which limits our understanding of the neural strategies of the whole MN pool and of how the firing activity of each MN contributes to the neural drive to muscle. Here, we combine decomposed high-density EMG (HDEMG) data and a physiologically realistic model of MN population to predict the unknown recruitment and firing activity of the remaining unidentified MNs in the complete MN pool.\n\nIn brief, an experimental estimation of the synaptic current is input to a cohort of MN models, which are calibrated using the available decomposed HDEMG data, and predict the MN spike trains fired by the entire MN population. This novel approach is experimentally validated and applied to muscle force prediction from neuromuscular modelling.",

    "abstract": "We present Single-cell TOtal RNA Miniaturized sequencing (STORM-seq), a full-length single-cell ribo-reduced RNA sequencing protocol, optimized to profile thousands of cells per run. Using off-the-shelf reagents and random hexamer priming, STORM-seq recovers comprehensive RNA profiles from single cells with library complexity approaching that of bulk RNA-seq. Importantly, STORM-seq does not require specialized equipment and can be performed using standard lab equipment. STORM-seq identifies thousands of additional coding and non-coding transcripts not detected by existing methods, and recovers clinically relevant structural variants at the single-cell level. We apply STORM-seq to primary human fallopian tube epithelium (FTE), a complex solid tissue key to both human reproductive biology and ovarian carcinogenesis. In differentiation trajectory analyses, the improved resolution from STORM-seq reveals intermediate/transitional cell states, and a putative progenitor cell population. The results support a trajectory from a bipotent progenitor population to ciliated and secretory cell types in normal FTE. These findings are consistent across human subjects, sequencing depths, and platforms. Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) appear as key driver genes in both ciliated and secretory lineage trajectories, underscoring the importance of both coding and non-coding RNA in this tissue. By capturing essentially complete individual cellular transcriptomes, STORM-seq sheds new light on the transcriptional programs that establish cellular state and fate in complex tissues.",

    "abstract": "This modeling study investigates whether an orderly convergence of neuronal selectivities from cortical areas V1 and V2 can produce curvature selective receptive fields found in area V4. A model of the ventral visual pathway from V1 to V4 is composed of approximately 500,000 individual integrate and fire units. The V1 and V2 models are based on recent findings about the composition of V2 receptive fields. A novel proposal is made for how V4 neurons may create selectivity for varying degrees of local curvature through the orderly convergence of afferent inputs from V2. The study employs a novel method for simulating individual spikes in large numbers of model neurons using tensor programming and GPU hardware: Assuming that convergent functional micro-architectural patterns repeat in topographically organized visual space, the details of individual unit depolarization and spike time is modeled using convolution operations combined with a model for the time course of post-synaptic potentials. The few parameters in the model are set manually, and this is sufficient to qualitatively reproduce the V4 recordings. This demonstrates that convolution technologies can be used for the realistic simulation of large numbers of neurons at an intermediate level of biological detail.",

    "abstract": "We shift our gaze even when we orient attention internally to visual representations in working memory. Here, we show the bodily orienting response associated with internal selective attention is widespread as it also includes the head. In three virtual reality (VR) experiments, participants remembered two visual items. After a working memory delay, a central colour cue indicated which item needed to be reproduced from memory. After the cue, head movements became biased in the direction of the memorised location of the cued memory item - despite there being no items to orient towards in the external environment. The heading-direction bias had a distinct temporal profile from the gaze bias. Our findings reveal that directing attention within the spatial layout of visual working memory bears a strong relation to the overt head orienting response we engage when directing attention to sensory information in the external environment. The heading-direction bias further demonstrates common neural circuitry is engaged during external and internal orienting of attention.",

Over the years, flies bearing any of more than 100 attP docking sites have been constructed. One popular docking site, termed attP40, is located close to the Nesprin-1 orthologue MSP300 and lies upstream of certain MSP300 isoforms and within the first intron of others. Here we show that attP40 causes larval muscle nuclear clustering, which is a phenotype also conferred by MSP300 mutations. We also show that flies bearing insertions within attP40 can exhibit decreased MSP300 transcript levels in third instar larvae. Finally, chromosomes carrying certain \"transgenic RNAi project\" (TRiP) insertions into attP40 can confer pupal or adult inviability, or infertility. These phenotypes do not require transcription from the insertions within attP40. These results demonstrate that attP40 and insertion derivatives act as MSP300 insertional mutations. These findings should be considered when interpreting data from attP40-bearing flies.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation and enhanced expression of MYC transcription factors including MYC and MYCN contribute to majority of human cancers. For example, MYCN is amplified up to several hundred-fold in high-risk neuroblastoma. One potential consequence of elevated expression is liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), occurring when the concentration of certain macromolecules and biopolymers is above a threshold. Here, we show that in MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma cells, N-myc protein forms condensate-like structures. Using MYCN-nonamplified neuroblastoma cells that have no or little endogenous N-myc protein expression, we found that exogenously expressed N-myc undergoes LLPS in a concentration-dependent manner, and determined its threshold concentration for LLPS in the cellular context. Biophysically, N-myc condensates in live cells exhibit liquid-like behavior. The intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of N-myc is indispensable for LLPS. Functionally, the N-myc condensates contain its obligatory DNA-binding and dimerization partner, genomic DNA, transcriptional machinery, and nascent RNA. These condensates are dynamically regulated during cell mitosis, correlated with chromosomal condensation and de-condensation. We further show that the TAD and the DNA-binding domain are both required for transcriptional activity of N-myc condensates. Most importantly, using a chemogenetic tool that decouples the role of phase separation from changes in protein abundance level in the nucleus, we discovered that N-myc phase separation regulates gene transcription and promotes SH-EP cell proliferation. Interestingly, LLPS of N-myc only modulates a small proportion of N-myc-regulated genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that N-myc undergoes LLPS, and that its phase separation differentially modulates the transcriptome, partially contributes to gene transcription, and promotes cell proliferation. Our work opens a new direction in understanding Myc-related cancer biology that has been studied for several decades.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) can function as autoregulators of folded enzymes to which they are tethered. One example is the bacterial cell division protein, FtsZ. This includes a folded core and a C-terminal tail (CTT) that encompasses a poorly conserved, disordered C-terminal linker (CTL) and a well-conserved 17-residue C-terminal peptide (CT17). Sites for GTPase activity of FtsZs are formed at the interface between GTP binding sites and T7 loops on cores of adjacent subunits within dimers. Here, we explore the basis of autoregulatory functions of the CTT in Bacillus subtilis FtsZ (Bs-FtsZ). Molecular simulations show that the CT17 of Bs- FtsZ makes statistically significant CTL-mediated contacts with the T7 loop. Statistical Coupling Analysis of more than 103 sequences from FtsZ orthologs reveals clear covariation of the T7 loop and the CT17 with most of the core domain whereas the CTL is under independent selection. Despite this, we discover the conservation of non-random sequence patterns within CTLs across orthologs. To test how the non-random patterns of CTLs mediate CTT-core interactions and modulate FtsZ functionalities, we designed Bs-FtsZ variants by altering the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the CTL. Such alterations disrupt the core-CTT interactions, lead to anomalous assembly and inefficient GTP hydrolysis in vitro and protein degradation, aberrant assembly, and disruption of cell division in vivo. Our findings suggest that viable CTLs in FtsZs are likely to be IDRs that encompass non-random, functionally relevant sequence patterns that also preserve three-way covariation of the CT17, the T7 loop, and core domain.\n\nSignificance StatementZ-ring formation by the protein FtsZ controls cell division in rod-shaped bacteria. The C-terminus of FtsZ encompasses a disordered C-terminal linker (CTL) and a conserved CT17 motif. Both modules are essential for Z-ring formation and proper localization of FtsZ in cells. Previous studies suggested that generic intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) might be suitable functional replacements for naturally occurring CTLs. Contrary to this suggestion, we find that the sequence-encoded conformational properties of CTLs help mediate autoregulatory interactions between covarying regions within FtsZ. Functional properties of the CTL are encoded via evolutionarily conserved, non-random sequence patterns. Disruption of these patterns impair molecular functions and cellular phenotypes. Our findings have broad implications for discovering functionally consequential sequence features within IDRs of other proteins.",

    "abstract": "The dodecameric protein kinase CaMKII is expressed throughout the body. The alpha isoform is responsible for synaptic plasticity and participates in memory through its phosphorylation of synaptic proteins. Its elaborate subunit organization and propensity for autophosphorylation allow it to preserve neuronal plasticity across space and time. The prevailing hypothesis for the spread of CaMKII activity, involving shuffling of subunits between activated and naive holoenzymes, is broadly termed subunit exchange. In contrast to the expectations of previous work, we found little evidence for subunit exchange upon activation, and no effect of restraining subunits to their parent holoenzymes. Rather, mass photometry, crosslinking mass spectrometry, single molecule TIRF microscopy and biochemical assays identify inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation (IHP) as the mechanism for spreading phosphorylation. The transient, activity-dependent formation of groups of holoenzymes is well suited to the speed of neuronal activity. Our results place fundamental limits on the activation mechanism of this kinase.",

DNA2Vec is the most widely used method for DNA sequence embedding. However, it poorly scales to large data sets due to its extremely long training time in kmer embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient graph-based kmer embedding method, named Kmer-Node2Vec, to tackle this concern. Our method converts the large DNA corpus into one kmer co-occurrence graph and extracts kmer relation on the graph by random walks to learn fast and high-quality kmer embedding. Extensive experiments show that our method is faster than DNA2Vec by 29 times for training on a 4GB data set, and on par with DNA2Vec in terms of task-specific accuracy of sequence retrieval and classification.",

    "abstract": "The mustard family (Brassicaceae) is a scientifically and economically important family, containing the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and numerous crop species that feed billions worldwide. Despite its relevance, most published family phylogenies are incompletely sampled, generally contain massive polytomies, and/or show incongruent topologies between datasets. Here, we present the most complete Brassicaceae genus-level family phylogenies to date (Brassicaceae Tree of Life, or BrassiToL) based on nuclear (>1,000 genes, almost all 349 genera and 53 tribes) and plastome (60 genes, 79% of the genera, all tribes) data. We found cytonuclear discordance between nuclear and plastome-derived phylogenies, which is likely a result of rampant hybridisation among closely and more distantly related species, and highlight rogue taxa. To evaluate the impact of this rampant hybridisation on the nuclear phylogeny reconstruction, we performed four different sampling routines that increasingly removed variable data and likely paralogs. Our resulting cleaned subset of 297 nuclear genes revealed high support for the tribes, while support for the main lineages remained relatively low. Calibration based on the 20 most clock-like nuclear genes suggests a late Eocene to late Oligocene  icehouse origin of the family. Finally, we propose five new or re-established tribes, including the recognition of Arabidopsideae, a monotypic tribe to accommodate Arabidopsis. With a worldwide community of thousands of researchers working on this family, our new, densely sampled family phylogeny will be an indispensable tool to further highlight Brassicaceae as an excellent model family for studies on biodiversity and plant biology.",

Mice lacking the integrated stress response (ISR) induced eIF2 phosphatase, PPP1R15A, exhibit a dilated cardiomyopathy and severe weight loss following irradiation, whilst wildtype mice are unaffected. This is associated with increased expression of Gdf15 in the heart and increased levels of GDF15 in the circulation. We provide evidence that blockade of GDF15 activity prevents cachexia and slows the progression of heart failure. Our data suggests that cardiac stress mediates a GDF15 dependent pathway that drives weight loss and worsens cardiac function. We show relevance of GDF15 to lean mass and protein intake with patients with heart failure.

TLN1 was previously considered to be expressed as a single isoform. However, through differential pre-mRNA splicing analysis, we discovered a cancer-enriched, non-annotated 51-nucleotide exon in TLN1 between exons 17 and 18, which we refer to as exon 17b. TLN1 is comprised of an N-terminal FERM domain, linked to 13 force-dependent switch domains, R1-R13. Inclusion of exon 17b results in an in-frame insertion of 17 amino acids immediately after Gln665 in the region between R1-R2 which lowers the force required to open the R1-R2 switches potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction. Biochemical analysis of this isoform revealed enhanced vinculin binding, and cells expressing this variant show altered adhesion dynamics. Finally, we show that the TGF-{beta}/SMAD3 signaling pathway regulates this isoform switch. Future studies will need to consider the balance of these two TLN1 isoforms.",

    "abstract": "Models that predict brain responses to stimuli provide one measure of understanding of a sensory system, and have many potential applications in science and engineering. Stimulus-computable sensory models are thus a longstanding goal of neuroscience. Deep neural networks have emerged as the leading such predictive models of the visual system, but are less explored in audition. Prior work provided examples of audio-trained neural networks that produced good predictions of auditory cortical fMRI responses and exhibited correspondence between model stages and brain regions, but left it unclear whether these results generalize to other neural network models, and thus how to further improve models in this domain. We evaluated model-brain correspondence for publicly available audio neural network models along with in-house models trained on four different tasks. Most tested models out-predicted previous filter-bank models of auditory cortex, and exhibited systematic model-brain correspondence: middle stages best predicted primary auditory cortex while deep stages best predicted non-primary cortex. However, some state-of-the-art models produced substantially worse brain predictions. Models trained on clean speech (without added background noise) produced worse brain predictions, potentially because hearing in noise imposes constraints on biological auditory representations. The training task influenced the prediction quality for specific cortical tuning properties, with best overall predictions resulting from models trained on multiple tasks. The results generally support the promise of deep neural networks as models of audition, though they also indicate that current models do not explain auditory cortical responses in their entirety.",

    "abstract": "The anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) is a key brain region for orchestrating defensive behaviors. Here, we first examined AHA activity patterns during fear conditioning using in vivo functional imaging. We observed that neuronal activity in the AHA increases during both foot shock delivery and foot-shock associated auditory cues. Moreover, we used a combination of optogenetics and behavioral assays to determine the functional connectivity between the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the AHA. We found that photoactivation of the VMH[-&gt;]AHA pathway is aversive and triggers compulsive grooming behavior. Furthermore, we observed spatial and temporal changes of grooming behavior during the periods following VMH[-&gt;]AHA photoactivation. Interestingly, whole brain metabolic mapping using positron emission tomography (PET) combined with optogenetic activation of the VMH[-&gt;]AHA pathway in anesthetized mice revealed the amygdala as a downstream area activated by the stimulation of this pathway. Together, our findings show that the AHA responds to threat and that such increases in activity are sufficient to trigger compulsive grooming behavior. Thus, our results may help to understand some neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by repetitive and compulsive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "While animal and human decision strategies are typically explained by model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, their choice sequences often follow simple procedures based on working memory of past actions and rewards. Here we address how working memory-based choice strategies, such as win-stay-lose-switch (WSLS), are represented in the prefrontal and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops by simultaneous recording of neuronal activities in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the primary motor cortex (M1). In order to compare neuronal representations when rats employ working memory-based strategies, we developed a new task paradigm, a continuous/intermittent choice task, consisting of choice and no-choice trials. While the continuous condition (CC) consisted of only choice trials, in the intermittent condition (IC), a no-choice trial was inserted after each choice trial to disrupt working memory of the previous choice and reward. Behaviors in CC showed high proportions of win-stay and lose-switch choices, which could be regarded as \"a noisy WSLS strategy.\" Poisson regression of neural spikes revealed encoding specifically in CC of the previous action and reward before action choice and prospective coding of WSLS action during action execution. A striking finding was that the DLS and M1 in the motor cortico-basal ganglia loop carry substantial WM information about previous choices, rewards, and their interactions, in addition to current action coding.\n\nSignificance StatementWorking memory-based decision strategies, such as win-stay-lose-switch (WSLS), are widely observed in humans and animals. To address neuronal bases of these strategies, we recorded neuronal activities of rat prefrontal and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops during continuous/intermittent choice tasks. The rat choice strategy was a noisy WSLS in the continuous choice condition, whereas non-WSLS was selected in the intermittent choice condition. In the continuous choice condition, the primary motor cortex and the dorsolateral striatum in the motor loop more strongly conveyed information about previous choices, rewards, and their interactions than the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsomedial striatum in the prefrontal loop. These results demonstrate that the motor cortico-basal ganglia loop contributes to working memory-based decision strategies.",

We reveal that vast majority of M1 neurons projecting to the red and pontine nuclei constitutes different populations. Corticopontine neurons have higher conduction velocities and morphologically, a most homogeneous dendritic and spine distributions along cortical layers. Optogenetically inhibiting either kind projection, differentially affects forelimb movement onset and execution in a lever press task, but only the activity of corticopontine neurons is significantly correlated with trial-by-trial variations in reaction time.

Cell assemblies have historically been theorized as internal representations of specific stimuli or actions. Alternatively, cell assemblies can be defined without reference to an external world, by their endogenous ability to effectively elicit specific responses in downstream ( reader) neurons. However, this compelling framework currently lacks experimental support. Here, we provide evidence for assembly- reader communication. Reader activation was genuinely collective, functionally selective, yet flexible, implementing both pattern separation and completion. These processes occurred at the time scale of membrane integration, synaptic plasticity and gamma oscillations. Finally, assembly-reader couplings were selectively modified upon associative learning, indicating that they were plastic and could become bound to behaviorally relevant variables. These results support cell assemblies as an endogenous mechanism for brain function.",

    "abstract": "The nutritional symbiosis promoted by bacteria is a key determinant for adaptation and evolution of many insect lineages. A complex form of nutritional mutualism that arose in blood-sucking insects critically depends on diverse bacterial symbionts that supplement the diet of their nutrient-poor hosts with B vitamins. For instance, the triatomine bug Rhodnius prolixus, one of the main vectors of the Chagas disease in humans, is known to maintain a nutritional symbiosis with the gut symbionts Rhodococcus rhodnii.\n\nIn this study, we show that Wolbachia symbionts are also widely distributed in the Rhodnius genus. We have screened a large set of Rhodnius blood-sucking bugs samples belonging to 17 different species and to the three phylogenetic groups, prolixus, pallescens and pictipes. We assembled 13 genomes of Wolbachia infecting eight Rhodnius species from prolixus and pictipes groups. We demonstrate that these Wolbachia belong to supergroup F and are closely related to Wolbachia infecting the bedbug Cimex lectularius (wCle). Although bedbugs and triatomines are very distantly related hemipteran bugs, the genomes of their respective Wolbachia were highly similar, suggesting recent horizontal host switches. We also show that Rhodnius Wolbachia genomes infecting the prolixus group encode intact biotin operon, the hallmark of nutritional symbiosis in bedbugs. This operon is lacking from all the other Wolbachia infecting R. pictipes. Finally, host genome analyses provide evidence of massive Wolbachia-to-Rhodnius gene transfers in almost samples, providing footprints of past infections that support a widespread and probably ancient symbiotic association between Wolbachia and triatomine bugs.\n\nOur results suggest that both Wolbachia and R. rhodnii gut symbionts and their Rhodnius host maintain a highly prevalent symbiotic relationship, in which the vertically-inherited Wolbachia has the metabolic potantial to ensure or complement, the nutritional mutualism provided by the gut symbionts. Specific loss of the biotin operon in some symbiont genomes suggests that the boundaries between obligatory mutualism, facultative mutualism and parasitism in Wolbachia are transient and fluid, supporting a dynamic process of transition and reversion from one state to another.",

Here, we compared conventional ortholog detection using OrthoFinder with ortholog detection through genomic synteny in a dataset of eleven representative diploid Brassicaceae whole genome sequences spanning the entire phylogenetic space. We then evaluated the resulting gene sets regarding gene number, functional annotation, gene and species tree resolution. Finally, we used the syntenic gene sets for comparative genomics and ancestral genome analysis. The use of synteny resulted in considerably more orthologs and also allowed us to reliably identify paralogs. Surprisingly, we did not detect notable differences between species trees reconstructed from syntenic orthologs compared other gene sets, including the Angiosperm353 set and a Brassicaceae specific target enrichment gene set. However, the synteny dataset comprised a multitude of gene functions, strongly suggesting that this method of marker selection for phylogenomics is suitable for studies that value downstream gene function analysis, gene interaction and network studies. Finally, we present the first ancestral genome reconstruction for the Core Brassicaceae predating the Brassicaceae lineage diversification [~]25 million years ago.",

Because previous studies have identified no HSP70cA genes in vertebrates, we hypothesized that this gene has lost on the evolutionary path to vertebrates. To test this hypothesis, the present study conducted a comprehensive database search followed by phylogenetic and synteny analyses. The HSP70cA gene was present in invertebrates and animals that belong to subphyla of Chordata, Cephalochordata (lancelets) and Tunicata (tunicates). However, the genomes of early vertebrates in the subphylum Craniata (lamprey, hagfish, elephant shark, and coelacanth) contained only HSP70cB genes, suggesting the loss of the HSP70cA gene in the early period of vertebrate evolution. Synteny analysis using available genomic resources indicated that the synteny around the HSP70 genes was generally conserved between tunicates, but it was largely different between tunicates and lamprey. These results suggest the presence of dynamic chromosomal rearrangement in early vertebrates, which possibly caused the loss of the HSP70cA gene in the vertebrate lineage.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity among individuals in fitness components is what selection acts upon. One of the fundamental questions in evolution is how such heterogeneity arises and is maintained. Fundamental evolutionary theories predict that selection acts against such heterogeneity but contrasting these predictions substantial non-genetic and non-environmental driven variability in phenotypes can be observed; not only under highly controlled lab conditions, but also in less controlled settings. Here we ask, by analysing structured population models across a large range of biological taxa, how selective forces act on the processes that generate variation among life courses. Our findings suggest that non-genetic, non-environmental driven variation is in general neither truly neutral, selected for, or selected against. Much variation exists among species and populations within species, with mean patterns suggesting close to neutral evolution of life course variability. Populations that show greater diversity of life courses do not show, in general, increased or decreased population growth rates, and selective forces acting on the processes of diversification seem not to generally increase or decrease life course variability. Approaches in quantitative genetics that identified similar lack of understanding of maintenance of variability might be extended to include non-genetic and non-environmental driven variability. We believe to be only at the beginning in understanding the evolution and maintenance of non-genetic non environmental variation.",

    "abstract": "Coronary arteries are part of the vascular system that nourishes the heart; they are generally considered a synapomorphy of jawed vertebrates. However, the so-called coronary arteries originated from different body parts in amniotes and other groups, and the evolution of these arteries remains unclear. Here we propose that the amniote coronary arteries were newly obtained, overriding the ancestral arterial systems. In mouse (Mus musculus) and quail (Coturnix japonica) embryos, the amniote-type coronary arteries are established by the reconstitution of the transient vascular plexus (aortic subepicardial vessels; ASVs) on the outflow tract and the primitive coronary plexus during the development. In contrast, amphibians (Xenopus laevis, Hyla japonica, Lithobates catesbeianus, and Cynops pyrrhogaster) retain the ASV-like vasculature as extrinsic cardiac arteries throughout their lives and have no primitive coronary plexus. A comparison of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and chondrichthyans (Lamna sp., Narke japonica, and Deania calcea) suggested that their hypobranchial arteries correspond morphologically to the ASVs and also serve as heart-feeding arteries throughout their lives. Thus, the coronary artery of adult amniotes is an evolutionary novelty that has acquired new anatomical connections through the addition of a new developmental process to the ancestral pattern. This change is probably related to the modification of branchial arteries, highlights the drastic morphological changes underlying the physiological transition in amniote evolution.",

    "abstract": "The cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) control pivotal physiological actions such as fluid and electrolyte balance, cardiovascular homeostasis, and adipose tissue metabolism by activating their receptor enzymes (NPRA and NPRB). These receptors are homodimers that generate intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The NP receptor NPRC, nicknamed the clearance receptor, lacks a guanylyl cyclase domain; instead, it can bind the NPs to internalize and degrade them. The conventional paradigm is that by competing for and internalizing NPs, NPRC blunts the ability of NPs to signal through NPRA and NPRB. Here we show another previously unknown mechanism by which NPRC can interfere with the cGMP signaling function of the NP receptors. By forming a heterodimer with monomeric NPRA or NPRB, NPRC can prevent the formation of a functional guanylyl cyclase domain and thereby suppress cGMP production in a cell-autonomous manner.\n\nSignificance StatementNatriuretic peptides (NP) are hormones that are established regulators of vascular and cardiac function, in part through their regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. NPs signal through particulate guanylyl cyclases (NPRA and NPRB), which are homodimeric membrane-bound receptor enzymes that generate cGMP upon NP binding. Additionally, a  silent NP receptor (NPRC) lacks the guanylyl cyclase domain and is a negative regulator of NP signaling. It has been demonstrated that NPRC undergoes internalization and recycling and thus removes NPs, thereby blunting activation of the guanylyl cyclase-containing receptors. Here we show an additional mechanism by which NPRC inhibits NP signaling. Our results show that NPRC can directly interact with NPRA and NPRB, forming non-functional receptor heterodimers with NPRA and NPRB, thereby abrogating NP-evoked cGMP production. This finding establishes another novel mechanistic role for NPRC.",

In this study, we identified several lineages of enterococcal linear plasmids that are structurally conserved and occur globally. pELF1-like linear plasmids show plasticity in acquiring and maintaining AMR genes, often via transposition with the mobile genetic element IS1216E. This linear plasmid family has several characteristics enabling long-term persistence in the bacterial population, including high horizontal self-transmissibility, low-level transcription of plasmid-encoded genes, and a moderate effect on the Enterococcus faecium genome alleviating fitness cost and promoting vertical inheritance. Combined with its broad host range, the linear plasmid is an important factor in the spread and maintenance of AMR genes among enterococci.",

    "abstract": "While functions of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome include maintenance of immune homeostasis and protection against infectious disease, its role in determining disease severity during Plasmodium infection has been limited to mouse models and observational human cohorts. Here, we performed controlled Plasmodium infection in both humans and rhesus macaques (RMs) to experimentally determine the impact of GI microbiome composition on disease progression. Through analysis of serially collected microbiome samples, we identified a high-risk microbial signature that strongly associated with increased risk of developing severe parasitemia in human participants. Importantly, we identified a parallel phenomenon in RMs. The combined weight of this evidence demonstrates that pre-infection GI microbiome composition is highly indicative of P. falciparum disease risk. Moreover, our observation that P. fragile-microbiome dynamics in RMs closely mirrors P. falciparum-microbiome interactions in humans strongly supports the use of this model in pre-clinical investigations of novel microbiome-targeting approaches to reduce malaria burden.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) has been reported to cause considerable complicated infections. Subspecies identification of MABC is crucial for adequate treatment due to different antimicrobial resistance property amid the subspecies. However, long incubation days is needed for the traditional antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) method. Effective antibiotics administration often delayed considerably and caused unfavorable outcomes. Thus, we proposed a novel and accurate method to identify subspecies and its potential antibiotics resistance, to guide clinical treatment within hours.\n\nMethodsSubspecies of the MABC isolates were determined by secA1, rpoB, and hsp65. AST was tested by using microdilution method, as well as sequencing of erm(41) and rrl genes. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) spectra were analyzed. The informative peaks on MS spectra were detected by random forest (RF) importance. Machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to build models for classifying MABC subspecies based on MALDI-TOF spectrum. The models were developed and validated by nested five-fold cross-validation to avoid over-fitting.\n\nResultsIn total, 102 MABC isolates (52 subspecies abscessus and 50 subspecies massiliense) were analyzed. Top informative peaks including m/z 6715, 4739, 2805, etc. were identified. RF model attained AUROC of 0.9166 (95% CI: 0.9072-0.9196) and outperformed other algorithms in discriminating subspecies abscessus from massiliense.\n\nConclusionWe developed a MALDI-TOF based ML model for rapid and accurate MABC subspecies identification. The novel diagnostic tool would guide a more accurate and timely MABC subspecies-specific treatment.",

    "abstract": "The basic building blocks of the electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes are ion channels integrated in the cell membranes. Close to the ion channels there are very strong electrical and chemical gradients. However, these gradients extend for only a few nano-meters and are therefore commonly ignored in mathematical models. The full complexity of the dynamics is modelled by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations but these equations must be solved using temporal and spatial scales of nano-seconds and nano-meters. Here we report solutions of the PNP equations in a fraction of two abuttal cells separated by a tiny extracellular space. We show that when only the potassium channels of the two cells are open, a stationary solution is reached with the well-known Debye layer close to the membranes. When the sodium channels of the left cell are opened, a very strong and brief electrochemical wave emanates from the channels. If the extracellular space is sufficiently small and the number of sodium channels is sufficiently high, the wave extends all the way over to the neighboring cell and may therefore explain cardiac conduction even at very low levels of gap junctional coupling.",

    "abstract": "Cells rely on their cytoskeleton for key processes including division and directed motility. Actin filaments are a primary constituent of the cytoskeleton. Although actin filaments can create a variety of network architectures linked to distinct cell functions, the microscale molecular interactions that give rise to these macroscale structures are not well understood. In this work, we investigate the microscale mechanisms that produce different branched actin network structures using an iterative classification approach. First, we employ a simple yet comprehensive agent-based model that produces synthetic actin networks with precise control over the microscale dynamics. Then we apply machine learning techniques to classify actin networks based on measurable network density and geometry, identifying key mechanistic processes that lead to particular branched actin network architectures. Extensive computational experiments reveal that the most accurate method uses a combination of supervised learning based on network density and unsupervised learning based on network symmetry. This framework can potentially serve as a powerful tool to discover the molecular interactions that produce the wide variety of actin network configurations associated with normal development as well as pathological conditions such as cancer.",

    "abstract": "Some calcium channels selectively permeate Ca2+, despite the high concentration of monovalent ions in the surrounding environment, which is essential for many physiological processes. Without atomistic and dynamical ion permeation details, the underlying mechanism of Ca2+ selectivity has long been an intensively studied, yet controversial, topic. This study takes advantage of the homologous Ca2+-selective TRPV6 and non-selective TRPV1 and utilizes the recently solved open-state structures and a newly developed multi-site calcium model to investigate the ion binding and permeation features in TRPV channels by molecular dynamics simulations. Our results revealed that the open-state TRPV6 and TRPV1 show distinct ion-binding patterns in the selectivity filter, which lead to different ion permeation features. Two Ca2+ ions simultaneously bind to the selectivity filter of TRPV6 compared with only one Ca2+ in case of TRPV1. Multiple Ca2+ binding at the selectivity filter of TRPV6 permeated in a concerted manner, which could efficiently block the permeation of Na+. Cations of various valences differentiate between the binding sites at the entrance of the selectivity filter in TRPV6. Ca2+ preferentially binds to the central site with a higher probability of permeation, repelling Na+ to a peripheral site. Therefore, we believe that ion binding competition at the selectivity filter of calcium channels, including the binding strength and number of binding sites, determines Ca2+ selectivity under physiological conditions. Additionally, our results showed that pore helix flexibility and the cytosolic domain of TRPV channels regulate ion permeability.",

The data presented in this manuscript reveal the mechanism of recognition of crRNA and target ssRNA by gRAMP, also, this work reports the structure of the CRISPR type III-E effector in complex with the binding partner TPR-CHAT, which provides vital clues for elucidating the functional relation between the CRISPR-Cas system and caspase peptidase.",

    "abstract": "THOC6 is the genetic basis of autosomal recessive THOC6 Intellectual Disability Syndrome (TIDS). THOC6 facilitates the formation of the Transcription Export complex (TREX) tetramer, composed of four THO monomers. The TREX tetramer supports mammalian mRNA processing that is distinct from yeast TREX dimer functions. Human and mouse TIDS model systems allow novel THOC6-dependent TREX tetramer functions to be investigated. Biallelic loss-of-function (LOF) THOC6 variants do not influence the expression and localization of TREX members in human cells, but our data suggests reduced binding affinity of ALYREF. Impairment of TREX nuclear export functions were not detected in cells with biallelic THOC6 LOF. Instead, mRNA mis-splicing was observed in human and mouse neural tissue, revealing novel insights into THOC6-mediated TREX coordination of mRNA processing. We demonstrate that THOC6 is required for regulation of key signaling pathways in human corticogenesis that dictate the transition from proliferative to neurogenic divisions that may inform TIDS neuropathology.",

While most cellular quiescence/ageing research have focused on the survivability and from the population level, the question how the regenerative activity change with the quiescence time (i.e., chronological age) has rarely been addressed quantitatively. In this work, we systematically measured both features in ageing quiescent fission yeast cells at single cell level. We found that the regenerative activity declines linearly before survivability decline and the cellular chronological ageing speed is predetermined by the initial niche condition. Moreover, this linear ageing behavior is robust under various niche conditions and follows a common ageing trajectory in terms of gene expression. Furthermore, initial calorie restriction was found to improve not only the survivability but also the later regenerative activity. Our results reveal a continuous diverse spectrum of quiescence depth and ageing plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Rivers, creeks, streams are integrators of biological, chemical and physical processes occurring in a catchment linking land cover from the headwaters to the outlet. The dynamics of human and animal pathogens in catchments have been widely studied in a large variety of contexts allowing the optimization of disease risk reduction. In parallel, there is an emerging awareness that crop pathogens might also be disseminated via surface waters especially when they are used for irrigation. However, there are no studies on the extent to which potential plant pathogens are present - nor about their dynamics - along the full course of a catchment. Here we have compared the seasonal dynamics of populations of the Pseudomonas syringae (Psy) and the Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) species complexes along a 270 km stretch of the Durance River from the upstream alpine reaches to the downstream agricultural production areas at the confluence with the Rhone River at Avignon. Among 168 samples collected at 21 sites in fall, winter, spring and summer of 2016 and 2017, Psy strains were detected at all sampling sites and in 156 of the samples at population densities up to 105 bacteria L-1. In contrast, SRP strains were detected in 98 of the samples, mostly from the southern part of the river, at population densities that did not exceed 3 x 104 bacteria L-1. Among the biological and chemical parameters that were characterized at each sampling site, temperature was the only factor that explained a significant amount of the variability in population size for both species complexes. Psy densities decreased with increasing temperature whereas SRP densities increased with increasing temperature. River-borne populations of SRP were composed mainly of Pectobacterium versatile and P. aquaticum that have little known epidemiological importance. Only a few strains of Pectobacterium and Dickeya species reputed for their epidemiological impact were observed. In contrast, Psy populations at all sites were dominated by a genetic lineage of phylogroup 2 known from other studies for its broad host range and its geographic and habitat ubiquity. Our observations suggest that surveillance of river water for SRP could be leveraged to signal diagnostic and management reactions to avoid disease outbreaks. In contrast, the constant presence of Psy throughout the catchment in absence of regular and widespread disease outbreaks due to this group of bacteria suggests that surveillance should focus on future changes in land use, river water conditions and agronomic practices that could destabilize the mechanisms currently holding Psy outbreaks in check.",

    "abstract": "Odontocetes depredating fish caught on longlines is a serious socio-economic and conservation issue. A good understanding of the depredation behaviour by odontocetes is therefore required. Within this purpose, a method is described to follow diving behaviour of sperm whales, considered as proxy of their foraging activity. The study case took place around Kerguelen Islands from the Patagonian toothfish fishery. The method uses the coherence between direct-path sperm whale clicks, recorded by two synchronized hydrophones, to distinguish them from decoherent clicks that are reflected by the water surface or seefloor (due to surface roughness). Its low computational cost permits to process large dataset and bring new insights on sperm whales behaviour. Detection of sperm whale clicks permits to estimate the number of sperm whales and to assess their diving behaviour. Three diving behaviour were identified as \"Water Column\" (individual goes down and up), \"Water Wander\" (individual seems to go up and down multiple times in the water column), and \"Seafloor\" (individual spend time on the seabed). Results suggest that sperm whales have different diving behaviours with specific dives as they are either \"interacting\" or \"not-interacting\" with a hauling vessel.",

    "abstract": "The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway plays an important role in the establishment of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis (ECM) between Laccaria bicolor and poplar. We previously showed that the L. bicolor effector MiSSP7 induces the stabilization of the poplar JAZ6, a JA co-repressor protein that binds to Populus MYC2.1 and MYC2.2, orthologs of the Arabidopsis MYC2 transcription factor (TF), blocking their activity. Here we showed that both TFs play a central role in root colonization by L. bicolor mycelium, since their overexpression decreased the formation of the Hartig net, the hyphal network involved in symbiotic nutrient exchanges. By combining RNA sequencing and DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (DAP-seq) analysis, we identified a core set of JA-responsive genes directly activated by poplar MYC2.1 and MYC2.2, that need to be bypassed by the fungi to colonize root apoplastic spaces. These genes encode for other TFs, receptor-like kinases and many defense-related proteins, including terpene synthases (TPS). Monoterpenes produced by some of these TPS impact L. bicolor growth and ECM formation, suggesting a role for poplar root monoterpenes as negative regulators of in planta fungal growth and ECM symbiosis.\n\nSignificance statementThe ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is a predominant mutualistic plant-fungus interaction occurring in forests, sustaining tree health. Ectomycorrhizal fungi colonize the root intercellularly establishing the symbiotic interface required for bidirectional nutrients exchanges, the Hartig net. During root colonization, the fungus L. bicolor produces the effector protein MiSSP7 that binds to the jasmonate co-receptor PtJAZ6, maintaining the repression of MYC2-targeted genes. Here we showed that defensive genes are major targets of MYC2, suggesting that their strict control is required to allow fungal colonization, with special emphasis on the host root monoterpene synthesis. Future research will focus on how root terpene defenses mediate belowground mutualistic interactions and how they can be manipulated to engineer plants with enhanced disease resistance but stable mutualistic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater mussels are of recognized importance for ecosystem functioning, for the provision of ecosystem services, and for human well-being. Whether people are more concerned about freshwater mussels has a large role to play in promoting and supporting political decisions that protect their habitat. A pilot study was performed in the Midwest of the United States to evaluate the awareness people have about freshwater mussels both native and non-native. Using semi-structured face-to-face interviews, I explore whether ecological knowledge is still in place in the community, and what the relationship is between knowledge, age and urbanization. Multinomial logistic regression has shown that population size and age class are significant predictors of ecological knowledge. Present results suggest that common channels of ecological knowledge transmission have been interrupted long ago. As a result, local ecological knowledge is being substituted by modern ecological knowledge. Nevertheless, new processes of ecological knowledge acquisition emerge. Under this scenario, future management prospects would rely on state institutions which are implementing alternative dissemination pathways in modern socio-ecological systems.",

    "abstract": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by extreme mood shifts, anxiety, and irritability during the premenstrual period. Abnormal sensitivity to allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that normally potentiates inhibition, and an increased ratio of neural excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) have been linked to the pathophysiology of PMDD. We hypothesized that in subjects with PMDD these factors will lead to an altered frequency of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) visual gamma oscillations, altered modulation of their power by the strength of excitatory drive and to an altered perceptual spatial suppression.\n\nWe examined women with PMDD and age-matched control women twice: during the asymptomatic follicular and symptomatic luteal phases of the menstrual cycle (MC). MEG gamma oscillations were recorded while modulating excitatory drive to the visual cortex by increasing drift rate of high-contrast visual grating. Visual perceptual suppression was assessed as the degree of deterioration of motion direction discrimination with increasing stimulus size.\n\nIn women with PMDD, the peak frequency of the gamma response (GR) and its modulation by the drift rate were normal, whereas modulation of the GR power was significantly altered. A moderate increase in drift rate had an unusually strong facilitating effect on the GR power in PMDD, regardless of the MC phase.

    "abstract": "Minute insects such as parasitic micro-wasps have high basic and applied importance, for their widespread use as biocontrol agents. Their dispersal is a phenotype of particular interest. Classically, it is evaluated using field releases, but those are time consuming, costly, and their results highly variable, preventing high-throughput and repeatability. Alternatively, dispersal can be studied using small-scale assays, but those neglect important higher-scale processes. Consequently, proper evaluation of dispersal is often complicated or lacking in academic studies and biocontrol breeding programs. Here we introduce a new method, the double-spiral maze, that allows the study of spatial propagation at relevant scales (several hours and meters), retaining high throughput and experimental power. The method records the location of every individual at every time, enabling accurate precise estimates of diffusion coefficients or other dispersal metrics. We describe this affordable, scalable, and easy-to-implement method, and illustrate its application with a species of agricultural interest.",

    "abstract": "1Previous models of growers decision-making during epidemics have unrealistically limited disease management choices to just two options. Here, we expand previous game-theoretic models of grower decision-making to include three control options: crop that is either tolerant, resistant, or susceptible to disease. Using Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) as a case study, we investigate how growers can be incentivised to use different control options to achieve socially-optimal outcomes. To do this, we consider the efforts of a \"social planner\" who moderates the price of crops. We find that subsidising tolerant crop costs the social planner more in subsidies, as its use encourages selfishness and widespread adoption. Subsidising resistant crop, however, provides widespread benefits by reducing the prevalence of disease across the community of growers, including those that do not control, reducing the number of subsidies required from the social planner. We then use Gini coefficients to measure equitability of each subsidisation scheme. This study highlights how grower behaviour can be altered using crop subsidies to promote socially-optimal outcomes during epidemics.",

Here, we propose SpecVar to integrate paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression data into context-specific regulatory network atlas and regulatory categories, conduct heritability enrichment analysis with GWAS summary statistics, identify relevant tissues, and depict shared heritability and regulations by relevance correlation. Our method improves power upon existing approaches by associating SNPs with context-specific regulatory elements to assess heritability enrichments and by explicitly prioritizing gene regulations underlying relevant tissues. Experiments on GWAS of six phenotypes show that SpecVar can improve heritability enrichment, accurately detect relevant tissues, and reveal causal regulations. Furthermore, SpecVar correlates the relevance patterns for pairs of phenotypes and better reveals shared heritability and regulations of phenotypes than existing methods. Studying GWAS of 206 phenotypes in UK-Biobank demonstrates that SpecVar leverages the context-specific regulatory network atlas to prioritize phenotypes relevant tissues and shared heritability for biological and therapeutic insights.

    "abstract": "The nodes of a de Bruijn graph (DBG) of order k correspond to the set of k-mers occurring in a set of reads and an edge is added between two nodes if there is a k - 1 length overlap between them. When using a DBG for genome assembly, the choice of k is a delicate issue: if k is too small, the DBG is tangled, making graph traversal ambiguous, whereas choosing k too large makes the DBG disconnected, resulting in more and shorter contigs. The variable order de Bruijn graph (voDBG) has been proposed as a way to avoid fixing a single value of k. A voDBG represents DBGs of all orders in a single data structure and (conceptually) adds edges between the DBGs of different orders to allow increasing and decreasing the order. Whereas for a fixed order DBG unitigs are well defined, no properly defined notion of contig or unitig exists for voDBGs. In this paper we give the first rigorous definition of contigs for voDBGs. We show that voDBG nodes, whose frequency in the input read set is in interval [{ell}, h] for some h and{ell} > h/2, represent an unambiguous set of linear sequences, which we call the set of ({ell}, h)-tigs. By establishing connections between the voDBG and the suffix trie of the input reads, we give an efficient algorithm for enumerating ({ell}, h)-tigs in a voDBG using compressed suffix trees. Our experiments on real and simulated HiFi data show a prototype implementation of our approach has a better or comparable contiguity and accuracy as compared to other DBG based assemblers.",

Given this, we set out to determine if and how common TP53 alterations found in high-grade ECs impact radiotherapy response, and if manipulation of this signaling pathway could be utilized for therapeutic intervention.

    "abstract": "The transcription factor ETV7 is an oncoprotein that is up-regulated in all breast cancer (BC) types. We have recently demonstrated that ETV7 promoted breast cancer progression by increasing cancer cell proliferation and stemness and was also involved in the development of chemo- and radio-resistance. However, the roles of ETV7 in breast cancer inflammation have yet to be studied. Gene ontology analysis previously performed on BC cells stably over-expressing ETV7 demonstrated that ETV7 was involved in the suppression of innate immune and inflammatory responses. To better decipher the involvement of ETV7 in these signaling pathways, in this study, we identified TNFRSF1A, encoding for the main receptor of TNF-, TNFR1, as one of the genes down-regulated by ETV7. We demonstrated that ETV7 directly binds to the intron I of this gene, and we showed that the ETV7-mediated down-regulation of TNFRSF1A reduced the activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. Furthermore, in this study, we unveiled a potential crosstalk between ETV7 and STAT3, another master regulator of inflammation. While it is known that STAT3 directly up-regulates the expression of TNFRSF1A, here we demonstrated that ETV7 reduces the ability of STAT3 to bind to the TNFRSF1A gene via a competitive mechanism, leading to the repression of its transcription. These results suggest that ETV7 can reduce the inflammatory responses in breast cancer through the down-regulation of TNFRSF1A.",

Cells cultured with HNBC serum showed increased mRNA levels of pro-fibrotic genes, and reduced expression of the gap junction protein CX43. Nonetheless, both TCC and HNBC sera reduced the release of angiogenic and protective factors from CSCs. In fact, their paracrine support to tube-formation by endothelial cells and to preserved cell viability of cardiomyocytes in culture was significantly impaired. Treatment with the sera of both types of smokers also increased the expression of NOX isoforms and the release of H2O2 by CSCs.\n\nConclusionThe circulating molecules in the serum of chronic HNBC smokers induce fibrotic specification in CSCs. They also reduce the beneficial paracrine effects of stromal cells on endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, albeit to a reduced extent for some features.

We isolated human stromal cells from the atrial tissue of patients with cardiovascular diseases, and exposed them to the serum of young healthy subjects, that are exclusive HNBC smokers.

    "abstract": "Among the conservation community, it is well known that Earths mass species extinction crisis is getting worse. Yet, an often neglected problem is the need for effectively communicating the species extinction crisis to diverse audiences in ways that catalyse immediate action. Here we generated a streamlined threatened species recovery report card methodology, which combined two input indicators including planning and funding, one output indicator capturing habitat protection, and one outcome indicator which highlights threatened species trajectories, to provide simple scores for all Australian threatened species. We show that just 41 (2.3%) of species achieved an A grade for the input indicator (i.e., recovery plans and federal funding), 240 (13.3%) achieved a C grade, and 1,521 (84.4%) achieved an F. Five hundred and twenty nine (29.3%) species achieved an A for the output indicator (i.e, habitat protection), 130 (7.2%) achieved a B, 158 (8.8%) achieved a C, 189 (10.5%) achieved a D, 212 (11.8%) achieved an E, and 584 (32.4%) achieved a F. While five (0.3%) species achieved an A for the output indicator (i.e., threat status improvement), every other species (99.7%) achieved an F. We provide a method to combine scores to test how individual jurisdictions are tracking and show that Australia is achieving an F for the input and outcome indicators, and a D for the output indicator. While the threatened species recovery report card highlighted a clear failure in many federal environmental legislation responsibilities, it provides a baseline from which different governments can track policy progress and outlines clear direction for immediate improvement including developing adequate recovery plans, funding the actions in the recovery plans, protecting habitat from further destruction, verifying recovery through monitoring and evaluation of species trajectories, and supporting transparency and collaboration on the execution on the plans through an improved data infrastructure. Without an immediate step change in how Australia communicates and faces its species crisis, we will leave a tragic legacy of extinction and fail our obligations to future generations of Australians, and the international community.",

A key source of antigens for GC B cells are immune complexes (ICs) displayed on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Here we show that FDC spatial organization regulates antigen dynamics in the GC. We show the existence of two light zone (LZ) FDC populations, which differ in the duration of antigen retention. While the entire light zone (LZ) FDC network captures ICs initially, only the central cells of the network function as a long-term antigen reservoir, where different antigens arriving from subsequent immunizations co-localize. Mechanistically, central FDCs constitutively express subtly higher CR2 membrane densities than peripheral FDCs, which strongly increases the IC retention half-life. Even though repeated immunizations gradually saturate central FDCs, B cell responses remain efficient because new antigens partially displace old ones. These results reveal the principles shaping antigen display on FDCs during the GC reaction.",

More and more evidence has indicated abnormal wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway activation in TNBC but not luminal or her2+ breast cancer, and lncRNAs play a key role in a variety of cancers. Through lncRNA microarray profiling between Activated and inactivated Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway of TNBC tissues, lnc-WAL (Wnt/{beta}-catenin associated lncRNA; WAL) was selected as the top up-regulated lncRNA in Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway activation compared with the inactivation group. RIP-seq was analyzed between {beta}-catenin and IgG groups of, where lnc-WAL could interact with {beta}-catenin. Clinically, increased lnc-WAL in the TNBC tumor tissue was associated with shorter survival. lnc-WAL promoted the EMT, the ability of breast cancer stem cells (BCSC), proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Mechanistically, lnc-WAL inhibited {beta}-catenin protein degradation via Axin-mediated phosphorylation at serine 45. Subsequently, {beta}-catenin was accumulated in nuclear and activated the target genes. Importantly, Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway activation stimulated the transcription of lnc-WAL. These results pointed to a master regulatory role of lnc-WAL/Axin/{beta}-catenin in the malignant progression of TNBC. Our findings provide important clinical translational evidence that lnc-WAL maybe as potential therapeutic target against TNBC.",

Therefore, we generated Zmat3 knockout and compound gene knockout mice, lacking Zmat3 and p21, Zmat3 and Puma or all three genes. Puma-/-p21-/-Zmat3-/- triple knockout mice developed tumours at a significantly higher frequency compared to wild type, Puma-/-Zmat3-/- or p21-/- Zmat3-/-deficient mice. Interestingly, we observed that the triple and Puma-/-Zmat3-/- double deficient animals succumbed to lymphoma, while p21-/-Zmat3-/- animals developed mainly solid cancers. This analysis suggests that in addition to ZMAT3 loss, additional TRP53-regulated processes must be disabled simultaneously for TRP53-mediated tumour suppression to fail. Interestingly, our findings also reveal that the absence of different TRP53 regulated tumour suppressive processes changes the tumour spectrum, which suggests that different TRP53 tumour suppressive pathways are more critical in different tissues.",

    "abstract": "Establishment of an mRNA vaccine platform in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is important to enhance vaccine accessibility and ensure future pandemic preparedness. Here, we describe the preclinical studies of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA encoding prefusion-unstabilized ectodomain spike protein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) \"ChulaCov19\". In BALB/c mice, ChulaCov19 at 0.2, 1, 10, and 30 g given 2 doses, 21 days apart, elicited robust neutralizing antibody (NAb) and T cells responses in a dose-dependent relationship. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of micro-virus neutralizing (micro-VNT) antibody against wild-type virus was 1,280, 11,762, 54,047, and 62,084, respectively. Higher doses induced better cross-neutralizing antibody against Delta and Omicron variants. This elicited specific immunogenicity was significantly higher than those induced by homologous prime-boost with inactivated (CoronaVac) or viral vector (AZD1222) vaccine. In heterologous prime-boost study, mice primed with either CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccine and boosted with 5 g ChulaCov19 generated NAb 7-fold higher against wild-type virus (WT) and was also significantly higher against Omicron (BA.1 and BA.4/5) than homologous CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccination. AZD1222-prime/mRNA-boost had mean spike-specific IFN{gamma} positive T cells of 3,725 SFC/106 splenocytes, which was significantly higher than all groups except homologous ChulaCov19. Challenge study in human-ACE-2-expressing transgenic mice showed that ChulaCov19 at 1 g or 10 g protected mice from COVID-19 symptoms, prevented SARS-CoV-2 viremia, significantly reduced tissue viral load in nasal turbinate, brain, and lung tissues 99.9-100%, and without anamnestic of Ab response which indicated its protective efficacy. ChulaCov19 is therefore a promising mRNA vaccine candidate either as a primary or a boost vaccination and has entered clinical development.",

Little is known regarding MPXV immunity in the context of MPXV infection or vaccination with Vaccinia-based vaccines (VACV). As with vaccinia, T cells are likely to provide an important contribution to overall immunity to MPXV. Here we leveraged the epitope information available in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) on VACV to predict potential MPXV targets recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. We found a high degree of conservation between VACV epitopes and MPXV, and defined T cell immunodominant targets. These analyses enabled the design of peptide pools able to experimentally detect VACV-specific T cell responses and MPXV cross-reactive T cells in a cohort of vaccinated individuals. Our findings will facilitate the monitoring of cellular immunity following MPXV infection and vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG) is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen strongly associated with colorectal cancer. Here, through comparative genomics analysis, we demonstrated that the genetic locus encoding the Type VIIb Secretion System (T7SSb) machinery is uniquely present in SGG in two different arrangements. SGG UCN34 carrying the most prevalent T7SSb genetic arrangement was chosen as the reference strain. To identify the effectors secreted by this secretion system, we inactivated the essC gene encoding the motor of this machinery. Comparison of the proteins secreted by UCN34 WT and its isogenic {Delta}essC mutant revealed six T7SSb effector proteins, including the expected WXG effector EsxA and three LXG-containing proteins. In this work, we characterized an LXG-family toxin named herein TelE displaying pore-forming activity. Seven homologs of TelE harboring a conserved glycine zipper motif at the C-terminus were identified in different SGG isolates. Scanning mutagenesis of this motif showed that the glycine residue at position 470 was crucial for TelE pore-forming activity. Unlike other pore-forming toxins commonly antagonized by a membrane protein, TelE activity was antagonized by a small protein TipE belonging to the DUF5085 family. Overall, we report herein a unique SGG T7SSb effector exhibiting a pore-forming activity against non-immune bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, 38 clinical isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG) were sequenced and a genetic locus encoding the Type VIIb secretion system (T7SSb) was found conserved and absent from 16 genomes of the closely related S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (SGP). The T7SSb is a bona fide pathogenicity island. Here, we report that the model organism SGG strain UCN34 secretes six T7SSb effectors. One of the six effectors named TelE displayed a strong toxicity when overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Our results indicate that TelE is a pore forming toxin whose activity can be antagonized by a non-canonical immunity protein named TipE. Overall, we report a unique toxin-immunity protein pair and our data expand the range of effectors secreted through T7SSb.",

    "abstract": "Cells regularly experience fluid flow in natural systems. However, most experimental systems rely on batch cell culture and fail to consider the effect of flow-driven dynamics on cell physiology. Using microfluidics and single-cell imaging, we discover that the interplay of physical shear rate (a measure of fluid flow) and chemical stress trigger a transcriptional response in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In batch cell culture, cells protect themselves by quickly scavenging the ubiquitous chemical stressor hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from the media. In microfluidic conditions, we observe that cell scavenging generates spatial gradients of H2O2. High shear rates replenish H2O2, abolish gradients, and generate a stress response. Combining mathematical simulations and biophysical experiments, we find that cells in flow are sensitive to a H2O2 concentration that is 100-1000 times lower than traditionally studied in batch cell culture. Surprisingly, the shear rate and H2O2 concentration required to trigger a transcriptional response closely match their respective values in the human bloodstream. Thus, our results explain a long-standing discrepancy between H2O2 levels in experimental and natural systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the shear rate and H2O2 concentration found in the human bloodstream trigger gene expression in the blood-relevant human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that flow sensitizes bacteria to chemical stress in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that antibiotics can both positively and negatively impact the infectivity of bacteriophages (phage), but the underlying mechanisms often remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that antibiotics that target the protein translation machinery can fundamentally alter the outcome of bacteria-phage interactions by interfering with the production of phage-encoded counter-defence proteins. Specifically, using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and phage DMS3vir as a model, we show that bacteria with CRISPR-Cas immune systems have elevated levels of immunity against phage that encode anti-CRISPR (acr) genes when translation inhibitors are present in the environment. CRISPR-Cas are highly prevalent defence systems that enable bacteria to detect and destroy phage genomes in a sequence-specific manner. In response, many phages encode acr genes that are expressed immediately following infection to inhibit key steps of the CRISPR-Cas immune response. Our data show that while phage carrying acr genes can amplify efficiently on bacteria with CRISPR-Cas immune systems in the absence of antibiotics, the presence of antibiotics that act on protein translation prevents phage amplification, while protecting bacteria from lysis. These results help to understand how antibiotics-phage synergy and antagonism depend on the molecular interactions that define phage infectivity and host immunity.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytosis is a complex multi-gene trait of eukaryotes and allegedly one of the very defining features of this group. Although well documented for free-living unicellular eukaryotes and in specific cellular types of animals, data on phagocytosis in intracellular biotrophic parasites are scant. Indeed, the definition of intracellular biotrophy as complete reliance of a parasite on a living host, with which it constantly negotiates for the exchange of nutrients, is at odd with the consumption of particulate matter suggested by phagocytosis. Phytomyxea are intracellular biotrophic parasites infecting a broad group of hosts, ranging from plants to stramenopiles. They belong to the clade Rhizaria, where phagotrophy (i.e., phagocytosis as main mode to acquire nutrients) is the main mode of nutrition. The exact mode of nutrition of the biotrophic phytomyxea, including the agriculturally impactful phytomyxid Plasmodiophora brassicae, is still unresolved; despite investigations and the availability of molecular data. For other Phytomyxea, observations are patchy and molecular data altogether lacking. Here, using available genomic and transcriptomic data for Phytomyxea and the de novo sequenced transcriptome of the brown algae parasite Maullinia ectocarpii, we investigate the likelihood that the genetic machinery underpinning phagotrophy is conserved within the clade. We further document intracellular phagocytosis in P. brassicae and M. ectocarpii by transmission electron microscopy and fluorescent in situ hybridization. Our investigations confirm that molecular signatures underpinning phagocytosis exist in Phytomyxea and hint at a smaller subset of genes used for intracellular phagocytosis, which is similar between the two parasites. Microscopic evidence confirms the existence of intracellular phagocytosis, which seems to coexist with the manipulation of host physiology typical of biotrophic interactions. In both phytomyxid parasites investigated intracellular phagocytosis has adapted to the intracellular environment and seemingly targets specific organelles. Our findings shed light on the feeding behaviour of Phytomyxea, providing new molecular data for the class; and suggest a paramount and previously unrecognised role for phagocytosis in biotrophic interactions between host and parasite.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in the assembly of microbial communities is how complex systems arise from a few components. Synthetic communities allow addressing the dynamics and mechanisms of complex microbial interactions. Most studies on microbial interactions are done in lapses of hours and even days, but microbes must be able to sense danger in seconds. We assembled a three-strain synthetic community from the phylum Bacillota that, based on previously evaluated paired interactions, appear to have different ecological roles: resistant (R), antagonists (A), and sensitive (S). The BARS synthetic community (Bacillota A + S + R) reproduces features of complex communities and exhibits higher-order interaction dynamics. The majority of the S strain population, Sutclifiella horikoshii 20a, dies within 5 min in a paired interaction with A strain, Bacillus pumilus 145. An emergent property appears upon adding the third interactor, as antagonism of strain A over S is not observed in the presence of the R strain, Bacillus cereus 111. After the first five min a change of state of the cells is observed, as the surviving population of the S strain seemed to have acquired tolerance to A. In summary, our model allows the study of the assembly dynamics of a three-species community and to evaluate the immediate outcome within a 30 min frame. The BARS has features of a complex system where the paired interactions do not predict the community dynamics. The model is amenable to mechanistic dissection and to modeling how the parts integrate to achieve collective properties.\n\n1 IMPORTANCEMicrobial communities are of utmost importance, given their roles in health, agriculture, and all biogeochemical cycles on Earth. Synthetic ecology studies communities by reducing the number of variables. Microbial interactions are usually evaluated in hours or days, however, upon a first encounter, bacteria must respond in minutes, particularly when competition involves killing of neighboring cells. We generated a synthetic community of three species that allows the study of community dynamics in a 30 min frame. We denominated our model BARS as it comprises Bacillota strains that in paired interactions are Antagonist, Resistant, or Sensitive. Even though in paired interaction the antagonist kills the sensitive strain, in a triple interaction, the resistant strain provides stability to the community by neutralizing the antagonism. Therefore, BARS is a rapid response model with features of a complex system where the paired interactions do not predict the community dynamics and exhibit emergent properties.",

This endemic marine mussel supports a booming aquaculture industry, which entirely relies on artificially collected seeds from natural beds that are translocated to a diverse physical-chemical ocean conditions for farming. Furthermore, mussel production is threatened by a broad range of microorganisms, pollution, and environmental stressors that eventually impact its survival and growth. Herein, understanding the genomic basis of the local adaption is pivotal to developing sustainable shellfish aquaculture. We present a high-quality reference genome of M. chilensis, which is the first chromosome-level genome for a Mytilidae member in South America. The assembled genome size was 1.93 Gb, with a contig N50 of 134 Mb. Through Hi-C proximity ligation, 11,868 contigs were clustered, ordered, and assembled into 14 chromosomes in congruence with the karyological evidence. The M. chilensis genome comprises 34,530 genes and 4,795 non-coding RNAs. A total of 57% of the genome contains repetitive sequences with predominancy of LTR-retrotransposons and unknown elements. Comparative genome analysis was conducted among M. chilensis and M. coruscus, revealing genic rearrangements distributed into the whole genome. Notably, Steamer-like elements associated with horizontal transmissible cancer were explored in reference genomes, suggesting putative phylogenetic relationships at the chromosome level in Bivalvia. Genome expression analysis was also conducted, showing putative genomic differences between two ecologically different mussel populations. Collectively, the evidence suggests that local genome adaptation can be analyzed to develop sustainable mussel production. The genome of M. chilensis provides pivotal molecular knowledge for the Mytilus complex evolution and will help to understand how climate change can impact mussel biology.",

We performed a Genome-Wide Association (GWA) analysis using RBC-Omics study participants with generated untargeted metabolomics data to identify metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL) in RBCs. We performed GWA analyses of 382 metabolites in 243 individuals imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 all-ancestry reference panel. Analyses were conducted using ProbABEL and adjusted for sex, age, donation center, number of whole blood donations in the past two years, and first ten principal components of ancestry. Our results identified 423 independent genetic loci associated with 132 metabolites (p < 5x10-8). Potentially novel locus-metabolite associations were identified for FLVCR1 and choline, and for LPCAT3 and the lysophosphatidylserine 16.0, 18.0, 18.1, and 18.2; these associations are supported by published rare disease and mouse studies. We also confirmed previous metabolite GWA results for associations including N(6)-Methyl-L-lysine and PYROXD2, and various carnitines and SLC22A16. Association between pyruvate levels and G6PD polymorphisms was validated in an independent cohort and novel murine models of G6PD deficiency (African and Mediterranean variants). We demonstrate that it is possible to perform metabolomics-scale GWA analyses with a modest, trans-ancestry sample size.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMetabolite heterogeneity in fresh (<14 day old) RBCs donated by volunteer donors is linked to genetic polymorphisms;\nC_LIO_LIWe report 2,831 high-confidence SNP-metabolite linkages (p < 5.0 x 10-8).

However, it is hard to select an ideal closely-related species, as more and more different species were studied, and this situation was particular seriously in plant studies. Here, we introduced a new software, CRISPR Integrated Design Platform (CIDP), to solve the problem by allowing users to input genomic sequences for designing sgRNAs. The main function of CIDP was to design sgRNAs after building the sgRNA database using the input genomic sequences. Furthermore, in order to minimize the off-target effects, CIDP will search sgRNAs that appear only once across the whole genome on the target sequences. Meanwhile, CIDP set relevant functions to identify shared sgRNAs of a group of genes. Moreover, we also set primer design and sequence extraction functions in CIDP to help users design sgRNAs efficiently.",

    "abstract": "STUDY QUESTIONCan artificial intelligence distinguish between euploid and aneuploid cells within the inner cell mass of mouse embryos using brightfield images?\n\nSUMMARY ANSWERA deep morphological signature (DMS) generated by deep learning followed by swarm intelligence and discriminative analysis can identify the ploidy state of inner cell mass (ICM) in the mouse blastocyst-stage embryo.\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYThe presence of aneuploidy - a deviation from the expected number of chromosomes - is predicted to cause early pregnancy loss or congenital disorders. To date, available techniques to detect embryo aneuploidy in IVF clinics involve an invasive biopsy of trophectoderm cells or a non-invasive analysis of cell-free DNA from spent media. These approaches, however, are not specific to the ICM and will consequently not always give an accurate indication of the presence of aneuploid cells with known ploidy therein.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONThe effect of aneuploidy on the morphology of ICMs from mouse embryos was studied using images taken using a standard brightfield microscope. Aneuploidy was induced using the spindle assembly checkpoint inhibitor, reversine (n = 13 euploid and n = 9 aneuploid). The morphology of primary human fibroblast cells with known ploidy was also assessed.\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSTwo models were applied to investigate whether the morphological details captured by brightfield microscopy could be used to identify aneuploidy. First, primary human fibroblasts with known karyotypes (two euploid and trisomy: 21, 18, 13, 15, 22, XXX and XXY) were imaged. An advanced methodology of deep learning followed by swarm intelligence and discriminative analysis was used to train a deep morphological signature (DMS). Testing of the DMS demonstrated that there are common cellular features across different forms of aneuploidy detectable by this approach. Second, the same approach was applied to ICM images from control and reversine treated embryos. Karyotype of ICMs was confirmed by mechanical dissection and whole genome sequencing.\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEThe DMS for discriminating euploid and aneuploid fibroblasts had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.89. The presence of aneuploidy also had a strong impact on ICM morphology (AUC-ROC = 0.98). Aneuploid fibroblasts treated with reversine and projected onto the DMS space mapped with untreated aneuploid fibroblasts, supported that the DMS is sensitive to aneuploidy in the ICMs, and not a non-specific effect of the reversine treatment. Consistent findings in different contexts suggests that the role of chance low.\n\nLARGE SCALE DATAN/A\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTIONConfirmation of this approach in humans is necessary for translation.\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSThe application of deep learning followed by swarm intelligence and discriminative analysis for the development of a DMS to detect euploidy and aneuploidy in the ICM has high potential for clinical implementation as the only equipment it requires is a brightfield microscope, which are already present in any embryology laboratory. This makes it a low cost, a non-invasive approach compared to other types of pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy. This study gives proof of concept for a novel strategy with the potential to enhance the treatment efficacy and prognosis capability for infertility patients.\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)K.R.D. is supported by a Mid-Career Fellowship from the Hospital Research Foundation (C-MCF-58-2019).

    "abstract": "In this study, we performed all-atom MD simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complexes for BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, an BA.3 Omicron subvariants, conducted a systematic mutational scanning of the RBD-ACE2 binding interfaces and analysis of electrostatic effects. The binding free energy computations of the Omicron RBD-ACE2 complexes and comprehensive examination of the electrostatic interactions quantify the driving forces of binding and provide new insights into energetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary differences between Omicron variants. A systematic mutational scanning of the RBD residues determines the protein stability centers and binding energy hotpots in the Omicron RBD-ACE2 complexes. By employing the ensemble-based global network analysis, we proposed a community-based topological model of the Omicron RBD interactions that characterized functional roles of the Omicron mutational sites in mediating non-additive epistatic effects of mutations. Our findings suggested that non-additive contributions to the binding affinity may be mediated by R493, Y498, and Y501 sites and are greater for the Omicron BA.1.1 and BA.2 complexes that display the strongest ACE2 binding affinity among the Omicron subvariants. A network-centric adaptation model of the reversed allosteric communication is unveiled in this study that established a robust connection between allosteric network hotspots and potential allosteric binding pockets. Using this approach, we demonstrated that mediating centers of long-range interactions could anchor the experimentally validated allosteric binding pockets. Through an array of complementary approaches and proposed models, this comprehensive and multi-faceted computational study revealed and quantified multiple functional roles of the key Omicron mutational site R493, R498 and Y501 acting as binding energy hotspots, drivers of electrostatic interactions as well as mediators of epistatic effects and long-range communications with the allosteric pockets.",

    "abstract": "Molecular recognition is of central importance in biology. The molecular determinants shaping recognition of one protein domain by another are incompletely understood, especially in the context of the complex function of molecular machines. Here, we combine NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the determinants of recognition of the C-terminal (cDsbD) domain of the transmembrane reductant conductor DsbD by its cognate partner, the N-terminal domain of the protein (nDsbD). As part of the natural cycle of this oxidoreductase, which effectively transfers electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, cDsbD and nDsbD toggle between oxidised and reduced states, something that modulates the affinity of the domains for each other and prevents otherwise unproductive reactions. We find that the redox state of cDsbD determines the dissociation rate of cDsbD-nDsbD complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate how the redox-state of the active site determines the stability of inter-domain hydrogen bonds and thus the dissociation rate. AlphaFold modelling and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of full-length DsbD in a realistic bacterial membrane again highlights the close proximity of the periplasmic domains and the importance of tuning the strength of the interactions of the periplasmic domains to enable electron transfer to cognate periplasmic partners such as CcmG. Our AlphaFold models are consistent with in vivo functional assays of DsbD mutants, which together help to reveal for the first-time a putative binding site for thioredoxin on the cytoplasmic side of DsbD.",

Here, we report a new Mango-based imaging platform. Its key advantages are tunability of spectral properties and applicability for visualization of small RNA molecules that require minimal tag size. The former advantage is due to an expanded (green-to-red-emitting) palette of TO1-inspired fluorogenic dyes, and the latter is ensured by the truncated duplex scaffold. To illustrate applicability of the improved platform, we tagged Mycobacterium tuberculosis sncRNA with the shortened aptamer-scaffold tag and visualized it in bacteria and bacteria-infected macrophages using the new red light-emitting Mango-activated dye.",

Several multi-omics studies have made available extensive evidence on host-pathogen interactions and potential therapeutic targets. Nonetheless, an increased understanding of host signaling networks regulated by post-translational modifications and their ensuing effect on the biochemical and cellular dynamics is critical to expanding the current knowledge on the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here, employing unbiased global transcriptomics, proteomics, acetylomics, phosphoproteomics, and exometabolome analysis of a lung-derived human cell line, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Norway/Trondheim-S15 strain induces time-dependent alterations in the induction of type I IFN response, activation of DNA damage response, dysregulated Hippo signaling, among others. We provide evidence for the interplay of phosphorylation and acetylation dynamics on host proteins and its effect on the altered release of metabolites, especially organic acids and ketone bodies. Together, our findings serve as a resource of potential targets that can aid in designing novel host-directed therapeutic strategies.",

The first two doses elicit weaker B cell and CD8+ T cell responses in HD than in CI, while CD4+ T cell responses are quantitatively similar. In HD, a third dose robustly boosts B cell responses, leads to convergent CD8+ T cell responses and enhances comparatively more Thelper (TH) immunity.

The third dose attenuates some features of TH cells in HD (TNF/IL-2 skewing), while others (CCR6, CXCR6, PD-1 and HLA-DR overexpression) persist.

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an FDA approved mucolytic drug used to treat acetaminophen-associated toxicity and obstructive pulmonary diseases. In this study, we assessed NACs antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of XDR K. pneumoniae, obtained from Madras Medical Mission Hospital, India. To assess the biofilm eradication ability of NAC, we grew biofilms in 96 well plates and treated the mature biofilms with different concentrations of NAC. We observed that the biofilms of only 3 isolates of XDR K. pneumoniae could be eradicated at a concentration as low as 20mg/ml. Although increasing the concentration of NAC to 80mg/mL could significantly reduce the biofilms of all the isolates up to 4-5 Log, NAC at a concentration of 100 mg/mL successfully eradicated the mature biofilms of all the isolates of XDR K. pneumoniae.

Whether islet architecture is set during development and remains passive in adulthood, or whether it requires active maintenance throughout life, has not been determined. To distinguish between these two models, we conditionally deleted Robo2 in {beta} cells of adult mice and observed their islet architecture following a two-month chase. Here, we show that deleting Robo2 in adult {beta} cells causes significant loss of islet architecture without affecting {beta} cell identity, maturation, or stress, indicating that Robo2 plays a role in actively maintaining adult islet architecture.

Many pathogens subvert host defenses by rapidly changing these structures to avoid detection, placing strong selective pressures on host immune proteins that repeatedly adapt to remain effective. Signatures of rapid evolution have been identified in numerous host immunity proteins involved in the detection of pathogenic protein substrates, but whether the same signals can be observed in host proteins engaged in interactions with other pathogen-derived molecules has received much less attention. This focus on protein-protein interfaces has largely obscured the study of fungi as contributors to host-pathogen evolutionary conflicts, despite their importance as a formidable class of vertebrate pathogens. Here, we provide evidence that many mammalian immune receptors involved in the detection of microbial glycans have been subject to recurrent positive selection. Notably, we find that rapidly evolving sites in these genes primarily cluster in key functional domains involved in carbohydrate recognition. Further, we identified convergent patterns of substitution in distinct primate populations at a site in the Melanin Lectin gene that has been associated with increased risk of invasive fungal disease. Our results also highlight the power of evolutionary analyses to reveal uncharacterized interfaces of host-pathogen conflict by identifying genes, such as CLEC12A, with strong signals of positive selection across multiple mammalian lineages. These results suggest that the realm of interfaces shaped by host-microbe conflicts extends beyond the world of host-viral protein-protein interactions and into the world of microbial glycans and fungi.",

    "abstract": "We present an improved ddRAD-Seq protocol for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It utilizes optimally sized restriction enzyme digestion fragments, quick acting ligases that are neutral with the restriction enzyme buffer eliminating buffer exchange steps, and adapters designed to be compatible with Illumina index primers. Library amplification and barcoding are completed in one PCR step, and magnetic beads are used to purify the genomic fragments from the ligation and library generation steps. Our protocol increases the efficiency and decreases the time to complete a ddRAD-Seq experiment. To demonstrate its utility, we compared SNPs from our protocol with those from whole genome resequencing data from Gossypium herbaceum and Gossypium arboreum. Principal component analysis demonstrated that the variability of the combined data was explained by the genotype (PC1) and methodology applied (PC2). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the SNPs from our method clustered with SNPs from the resequencing data of the corresponding genotype. Sequence alignments illustrated that for homozygous loci, more than 90% of the SNPs from the resequencing data were discovered by our method. Our analyses suggest that our ddRAD-Seq method is reliable in identifying SNPs suitable for phylogenetic and association genetic studies while reducing cost and time over known methods.",

    "abstract": "PIWI proteins and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a central role in repressing transposable elements in animal germ cells. It is thought that piRNAs are mainly produced from discrete genomic loci named piRNA clusters, which often contain many \"dead\" transposon remnants from past invasions and have heterochromatic features. In the genome of silkworm ovary-derived cultured cells called BmN4, a well-established model for piRNA research, torimochi was previously annotated as a unique and specialized genomic region that can capture transgenes and produce new piRNAs bearing a trans-silencing activity. However, the sequence identity of torimochi has remained elusive. Here, we carefully characterized torimochi by utilizing the updated silkworm genome sequence and the long-read sequencer MinION. We found that torimochi is in fact a full-length gypsy-like LTR retrotransposon, which is exceptionally active and has massively expanded its copy number in BmN4 cells. Many copies of torimochi in BmN4 cells have features of open chromatin and the ability to produce piRNAs. Therefore, torimochi may represent a young, growing piRNA cluster, which is still \"alive\" and active in transposition yet capable of trapping other transposable elements to produce de novo piRNAs.

    "abstract": "Drug metabolism by the microbiome can influence anti-cancer treatment success. We previously suggested that chemotherapies with antimicrobial activity can select for adaptations in bacterial drug metabolism that can inadvertently influence the hosts chemoresistance. We demonstrated that evolved resistance against fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy lowered its efficacy in worms feeding on drug-evolved bacteria (Rosener et al., 2020). Here we examine a model system that captures local interactions that can occur in the tumor microenvironment. Gammaproteobacteria colonizing pancreatic tumors can degrade the nucleoside-analog chemotherapy gemcitabine and, in doing so, can increase the tumors chemoresistance. Using a genetic screen in Escherichia coli, we mapped all loss-of-function mutations conferring gemcitabine resistance. Surprisingly, we found that one third of resistance mutations increase or decrease bacterial drug breakdown and therefore can either lower or raise the gemcitabine load in the local environment. Experiments in three E. coli strains revealed that evolved adaptation converged to inactivation of the nucleoside permease NupC, an adaptation that increased the drug burden on co-cultured cancer cells. The two studies provide complementary insights on the potential impact of microbiome adaptation to chemotherapy by showing that bacteria-drug interactions transpire locally and systemically and can influence chemoresistance in the host.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveNeural dynamical models reconstruct neural data using dynamical systems. These models enable direct reconstruction and estimation of neural time-series data as well as estimation of neural latent states. Nonlinear neural dynamical models using recurrent neural networks in an encoder-decoder architecture have recently enabled accurate single-trial reconstructions of neural activity for neuronal spiking data. While these models have been applied to neural field potential data, they have only so far been applied to signal feature reconstruction (e.g. frequency band power), and have not yet produced direct reconstructions of broadband time-series data preserving signal phase and temporal resolution.\n\nApproachHere we present two encoder-decoder model architectures - the RNN autoencoder (RAE) and multi-block RAE (MRAE) for direct time-series reconstruction of broadband neural data. We trained and tested models on multi-channel micro-Electricorticography (ECoG) recordings from non-human primate motor corticies during unconstrained behavior.\n\nMain ResultsWe show that RAE reconstructs micro-electrocorticography recordings, but has reconstruction accuracy that is band-limited to model scale. The MRAE architecture overcomes these time-bandwidth restrictions, yielding broadband (0-100 Hz), accurate reconstructions of ECoG data.\n\nSignificanceRAE and MRAE reconstruct broadband ECoG data through multiblock dynamical modeling. The MRAE overcomes time-bandwitdh restrictions to provide improved accuracy for long time duration signals. The reconstruction capabilities provided by these models for broadband neural signals like ECoG may enable the development of improved tools and analysis for basic scientific research and applications like brain-computer interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes play essential roles in normal brain function, with dysfunction implicated in diverse developmental and degenerative disease processes. Emerging evidence of profound species divergent features of astrocytes coupled with the relative inaccessibility of human brain tissue underscore the utility of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technologies for the generation and study of human astrocytes. However, existing approaches for hPSC-astrocyte generation are typically lengthy, incompletely characterized, or require intermediate purification steps, limiting their utility for multi-cell line, adequately powered functional studies. Here, we establish a rapid and highly scalable method for generating functional human induced astrocytes (hiAs) based upon transient Neurogenin 2 (NGN2) induction of neural progenitor-like cells followed by maturation in astrocyte media, which demonstrate remarkable homogeneity within the population and across 11 independent cell lines in the absence of additional purification steps. These hiAs express canonical astrocyte markers, respond to pro-inflammatory stimuli, exhibit ATP-induced calcium transients and support neuronal maturation in vitro. Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analyses reveal the generation of highly reproducible cell populations across individual donors, most closely resembling human fetal astrocytes, and highly similar to hPSC-derived astrocytes generated using more complex approaches. Finally, the hiAs capture key molecular hallmarks in a trisomy 21 disease model. Thus, hiAs provide a valuable and practical resource well-suited for study of basic human astrocyte function and dysfunction in disease.",

    "abstract": "SATB1 (Special A-T rich Binding protein 1) is a cell type specific factor involved in chromatin remodelling events that participate in the regulation of the genetic network in developing T cells and neurons. In T cells, SATB1 is a key factor required for lineage commitment, VDJ recombination, development and maturation. In B cells, SATB1 is described as binding to the MARs-E{micro} regions of the IgH locus. Considering that its expression varies during differentiation, the involvement of this factor needed to be clarified in B cells. Using a KO mouse model deleting SATB1 from the pro-B cell stage, we were able to examine the consequences of SATB1 deletion in naive and activated B cell subsets. Our model indicates firstly that SATB1 is not essential for B cell development and the establishment of a broad IgH repertoire. Second, we show that this factor exhibits an ambivalent function in mature B cells, acting sequentially as a positive and negative regulator of Ig gene transcription in naive and activated cells, respectively. Third, our study indicates that the negative regulatory function of SATB1 in B cells extends to the germinal center response in which this factor limits somatic hypermutation of Ig genes. This finding suggests that SATB1 may limit the introduction of unwanted mutations into B cells.",

    "abstract": "Microglia provide protection against a range of brain infections, but how these glial cells respond to fungi is poorly understood. We investigated the role of microglia in the context of cryptococcal meningitis, the most common cause of fungal brain infections in humans. Using a series of transgenic- and chemical-based microglia depletion methods we found that, contrary to their protective role during other infections, microglia supported cryptococcal fungal brain infection. We show that microglia become hosts for intracellular fungal growth and are a site in which the fungus accesses the restricted micronutrient copper. We developed a reporter fungal strain to track copper starvation responses by the fungus and found that yeast were protected from copper starvation within microglia. Lastly, we show that stimulation of microglia with IFN{gamma} causes restriction of phagosomal copper to intracellular fungi. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for why microglia depletion has a therapeutic effect in the context of this life-threatening fungal infection and is one of the few examples of microglia acting to promote infection. Our data demonstrate how tissue-resident phagocytes can support cryptococcal infections by acting as intracellular reservoirs and sites of microbial nutrient acquisition, and how these mechanisms may be blocked by IFN{gamma} immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome movements and licensing of synapsis must be tightly regulated during early meiosis to ensure accurate chromosome segregation and avoid aneuploidy, although how these steps are coordinated is not fully understood. Here we show that GRAS-1, the worm homolog of mammalian GRASP/Tamalin and CYTIP, coordinates early meiotic events with cytoskeletal forces outside the nucleus. GRAS-1 localizes close to the nuclear envelope (NE) in early prophase I and interacts with NE and cytoskeleton proteins. Delayed homologous chromosome pairing, synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly, and DNA double-strand break repair progression are partially rescued by the expression of human CYTIP in gras-1 mutants, supporting functional conservation. However, Tamalin, Cytip double knockout mice do not exhibit obvious fertility or meiotic defects, suggesting evolutionary differences between mammals. gras-1 mutants show accelerated chromosome movement during early prophase I, implicating GRAS-1 in regulating chromosome dynamics. GRAS-1-mediated regulation of chromosome movement is DHC-1-dependent, placing it acting within the LINC-controlled pathway, and depends on GRAS-1 phosphorylation at a C-terminal S/T cluster. We propose that GRAS-1 serves as a scaffold for a multi-protein complex coordinating the early steps of homology search and licensing of SC assembly by regulating the pace of chromosome movement in early prophase I.",

    "abstract": "Among the constraints on the evolution of remarkably long lifespans is an increased risk of developing cancer because organisms with long lifespans have more time to accumulate cancer-causing mutations than organisms with shorter lifespans. Indeed, while there is a strong correlation between lifespan and cancer risk within species, there is no correlation between maximum lifespan and cancer risk across species ( Petos Paradox). Here we use evolutionary genomics and comparative experimental biology to explore the mechanisms by which Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), which can live at least 211 years, evolved their extremely long lifespans. We found that the Bowhead whale genome encodes a species-specific retroduplicated CDKN2C (p18INK4C) gene (CDKN2CRTG). The CDKN2CRTG gene is embedded within a Cetacean-specific LINE L1 element, and is highly expressed in Bowhead whale tissues likely because it coopted an L1 promoter to drive constitutive expression. Furthermore we use a series of gain of function experiments to show how the duplicate CDKN2CRTG gene may influence cellular phenotypes such as cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair in ways that are beneficial for aging and cancer resistance. Remarkably, Bowhead and Right whales only diverged ~4-5 million years ago, suggesting the long lifespan of Bowheads may have evolved relatively recently and coincident with the origin of CDKN2CRTG.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=167 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/506958v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@22cb1aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@444631org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c4c8aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a510d3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

AKs commonly relapse, and up to 16% undergo malignant transformation into cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). There is a need for novel therapies that reduce the quantity and surface area of AKs as well as prevent malignant transformation to cSCCs. We recently showed that GZ17-6.02, an anti-cancer agent composed of curcumin, haramine, and isovanillin, inhibited the growth of H297.T cells. The present study evaluated the efficacy of a novel topical formulation of GZ17-6.02, known as GZ21T, in a murine model of AK generated by exposing SKH1 mice to ultraviolet irradiation. Treatment of mice with topical GZ21T inhibited the growth of AKs by decreasing both lesion count (p=.028) and surface area occupied by tumor (p=.026). GZ21T also suppressed the progression of AKs to cSCC by decreasing the count (p=.047) and surface area (p=.049) of lesions more likely to represent cSCC. RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses revealed that GZ21T suppressed several pathways, including MAPK (p=.026), Pi3K-Akt (p=.028), HIF-1 (p=.030), Wnt (p=.031), insulin (p=.011), and ErbB (p=.006) signaling.

Preclinical studies yielded several PARPi resistance mechanisms that do not involve BRCA1/2 reactivation, but their relevance in the clinic remains elusive. To investigate which BRCA1/2-independent mechanisms drive spontaneous resistance in vivo, we combined molecular profiling with functional analysis of the HR status of matched PARPi-naive and PARPi-resistant mouse mammary tumors harboring large intragenic deletions that prevent functional restoration of BRCA1/2. We observed restoration of HR in 64% of PARPi-resistant BRCA1-deficient tumors but none in the PARPi-resistant BRCA2-deficient tumors. Moreover, we found that 53BP1 loss is the prevalent resistance mechanism in HR-proficient BRCA1-deficient tumors, whereas resistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors is mainly induced by the loss of PARG. Our combined multi-omics analysis catalogued additional genes and pathways potentially involved in modulating PARPi response.",
