    "abstract": "One of the most influential, and controversial, ideas in neuroscience has been to understand the brain in terms of Bayesian computations. Unstated differences in how Bayesian ideas are operationalized across different models make it difficult to ascertain both which empirical data support which models, and how Bayesian computations might be implemented by neural circuits. In this paper, we make one such difference explicit by identifying two distinct philosophies that underlie existing neural models of Bayesian inference: one in which the brain recovers experimenter-defined structures in the world from sensory neural activity (Decoding), and another in which the brain represents latent quantities in an internal model that explains its inputs (Encoding). These philosophies require profoundly different assumptions about the nature of inference in the brain, and lead to different interpretations of empirical data. Here, we characterize and contrast both philosophies in terms of motivations, empirical support, and relationship to neural data. We also show that this implicit difference in philosophy underlies some of the debate on whether neural activity is better described as a sampling-based, or a parametric, distributional code. Using a simple model of primary visual cortex as an example, we show mathematically that it is possible that the very same neural activity can be described as probabilistic inference by neural sampling in the Encoding framework while also forming a linear probabilistic population code (PPC) in the Decoding framework. This demonstrates that certain families of Encoding and Decoding models are compatible with each other rather than competing explanations of data. In sum, Bayesian Encoding and Bayesian Decoding are distinct, non-exclusive philosophies, and appreciating their similarities and differences will help organize future work and allow for stronger empirical tests about the nature of inference in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Many gene signatures have been developed by applying machine learning (ML) on omics profiles, however, their clinical utility is often hindered by limited interpretability and unstable performance in different datasets. Here, we show the importance of embedding prior biological knowledge in the decision rules yielded by ML approaches to build robust classifiers. We tested this by applying different ML algorithms on gene expression data to predict three difficult cancer phenotypes: bladder cancer progression to muscle invasive disease; response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer, and prostate cancer metastatic progression. We developed two sets of classifiers: mechanistic, by restricting the training process to features capturing a specific biological mechanism; and agnostic, in which the training didnt use any a priori biological information. Mechanistic models had a similar or better performance to their agnostic counterparts in the testing data, with enhanced stability, robustness, and interpretability. Our findings support the use of biological constraints to develop robust and interpretable gene signatures with high translational potential.\n\nMotivationOmics-based gene signatures often suffer from overfitting and reduced performance when tested on independent data. This usually results from the discrepancy between the high number of features compared to the much smaller number of samples used in the training process, which results in the machine learning algorithm perfectly fitting the training data with a subsequent deterioration in performance in independent cohorts. We introduce a mechanistic framework to mitigate overfitting and improve interpretability by constraining the training process to simple rank-based decision rules recapitulating relevant, cancer-related, biological mechanisms. Our approach aims at reducing the number of training variables to a pre-defined set of biologically important features in the form of gene pairs. The classification mechanism depends entirely on the relative ordering of these pairs, making it robust to data preprocessing techniques, improving the overall interpretability of the resulting models with significant translational implications. Most importantly, these pairs are configured in such a way that the decision rules resulting from the genes relative order embed and recapitulate specific biological mechanism, inherently enhancing the classifiers interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of cancer growth have become increasingly more accurate both in the space and time domains. However, the limited amount of data typically available has resulted in a larger number of qualitative rather than quantitative studies. In the present study, we provide an integrated experimental-computational framework for the quantification of the morphological characteristics and the mechanistic modelling of cancer progression in 3D environments. The proposed framework allows for the calibration of multiscale, spatiotemporal models of cancer growth using state-of-the-art 3D cell culture data, and their validation based on the resulting experimental morphological patterns using spatial point-pattern analysis techniques. We applied this framework to the study of the development of Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells cultured in Matrigel scaffolds, and validated the hypothesis of chemotactic migration using a multiscale, hybrid Keller-Segel model. The results revealed transient, non-random spatial distributions of cancer cells that consist of clustered, and dispersion patterns. The proposed model was able to describe the general characteristics of the experimental observations and suggests that cancer cells exhibited chemotactic migration and accumulation, as well as random motion during the examined time period of development. The developed framework enabled us to pursue two goals; first, the quantitative description of the morphology of cancer growth in 3D cultures using point-pattern analysis, and second, the relation of tumour morphology with underlying biophysical mechanisms that govern cancer growth and migration.",

    "abstract": "Gram-positive bacterial cells are protected from the environment by a cell envelope which comprises of layers of peptidoglycan that maintain the cell shape and teichoic acids polymers whose biological function remains unclear. In Bacillus subtilis, loss of all Class A Penicillin-Binding Proteins (aPBPs) which function in peptidoglycan synthesis is conditionally lethal. Here we show that this lethality is associated with an alteration of the lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and the accumulation of the major autolysin LytE in the cell wall. Our analysis provides further evidence that the length and abundance of LTA acts to regulate the cellular level and activity of autolytic enzymes, specifically LytE. Importantly, we identify a novel function for the aminoacyl-phosphatidylglycerol synthase MprF in the modulation of LTA biosynthesis in B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. This finding has implications for our understanding of antimicrobial resistance (particularly daptomycin) in clinically relevant bacteria and the involvement of MprF in the virulence of pathogens, such as methicillin resistant S. aureus.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to dsDNA phages where multiple proteins are involved in programmed host lysis, lysis in ssRNA Fiersviridae and ssDNA Microviridae phages requires only a single gene (sgl for single gene lysis) to meet the size constraints of some of the smallest genomes in the biosphere. To achieve lysis, Sgl proteins exploit evolutionary \"weak spots\" in bacterial cell wall biogenesis. In several cases, this is done by inhibiting specific steps in Lipid II synthesis. Recently metatranscriptomics has revealed thousands of novel ssRNA phage genomes, each of which must carry at least one sgl gene. Determining the targets of these Sgl proteins could reveal novel vulnerabilities in bacterial envelope biogenesis and may lead to new antibiotics. Here, we employ a high-throughput genetic screen to uncover genome-wide host suppressors of Sgl activity and apply it to a set of diverse Sgls with unknown molecular targets. In addition to validating known molecular mechanisms, we determined that the Sgl of PP7, an ssRNA phage of P. aeruginosa, targets MurJ, the flippase responsible for Lipid II export which was previously shown to be the target of the Sgl of coliphage M. These two Sgls, which are unrelated and predicted to have opposite membrane topology, thus represent a case of convergent evolution. Another set of Sgls which are thought to cause lysis without inhibiting cell wall synthesis elicit a common set of multicopy suppressors, suggesting these Sgls act by the same or similar mechanism.",

However, the majority of patients inevitably go on to experience disease relapse through largely unknown means. To investigate leukemia-intrinsic CAR-T resistance mechanisms, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens in an immunocompetent murine model of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) utilizing a novel, modular guide RNA library. We identified IFN{gamma}/JAK/STAT signaling and components of antigen processing and presentation pathway as key mediators of resistance to CAR-T therapy in vivo, but not in vitro. Transcriptional characterization of this model demonstrated an upregulation of these pathways in CAR-T treated relapsed tumors, and examination of data from CAR-T treated patients with B-ALL revealed an association between poor outcomes and increased expression of JAK/STAT/MHC-I in leukemia cells. Overall, our data identify an unexpected mechanism of resistance to CAR-T therapy in which tumor cell interaction with CAR-T cells in vivo induces expression of an adaptive T-cell resistance program in tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates, some of which are liquid-like during health, can age over time becoming gel-like pathological systems. One potential source of loss of liquid-like properties during ageing of RNA-binding protein condensates is the progressive formation of inter-protein {beta}-sheets. To bridge microscopic understanding between accumulation of inter-protein {beta}-sheets over time and the modulation of FUS and hnRNPA1 condensate viscoelasticity, we develop a multiscale simulation approach. Our method integrates atomistic simulations with sequence-dependent coarse-grained modelling of condensates that exhibit accumulation of inter-protein {beta}-sheets over time. We reveal that inter-protein {beta}-sheets notably increase condensate viscosity but does not transform the phase diagrams. Strikingly, the network of molecular connections within condensates is drastically altered, culminating in gelation when the network of strong {beta}-sheets fully percolates. However, high concentrations of RNA decelerate the emergence of inter-protein {beta}-sheets. Our study uncovers molecular and kinetic factors explaining how the accumulation of inter-protein {beta}-sheets can trigger liquid-to-solid transitions in condensates, and suggests a potential mechanism to slow such transitions down.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPesticides are one of the most important anthropogenic-related stressors. In times of global pollinator decline, the role of integrated farming and that of urban gardens in supporting wild pollinators is becoming increasingly important. We circulated an online questionnaire to survey the plant protection practices among Hungarian farmers and garden owners with a particular emphasis on pollinator protection.\n\nRESULTSWe found that plant growers heavily rely on pesticide use, and pesticides are widely used in otherwise pollinator-friendly gardens. Whether pesticide use practices were driven by expert opinion and the respondents gender were the best predictors of pesticide use. Although most respondents supported pollinators, pesticides are also widely used among home garden owners, which can pose a non-evident ecological trap for pollinator populations in the gardens.\n\nCONCLUSIONSpecial attention should be paid to implementing measures to reduce pesticide, use not only in farmlands but also in home gardens. Environmental education and financial support through agroecological schemes could efficiently promote the transition. However, whereas farmers can be encouraged to reduce pesticide use mostly by expert advice, garden owners are likely to rely on more conventional information channels. The attitude of Hungarian plant growers can provide an insight into pesticide use practices of Central and Eastern European countries, but similar surveys are needed across Europe for a complete understanding of broad-scale processes. This work lays the foundations for similar studies which can inform and facilitate the transformation processes to pesticide-free farming and gardening.",

Here, we measured CeA activity using the activity marker c-Fos and CeA reactivity using fiber photometry paired with an aversive air-puff stimulus. We found that psilocin administration acutely increased CeA activity in both males and females and increased stimulus specific CeA reactivity in females, but not males. In contrast, psilocin produced time-dependent decreases in reactivity in males, but not females as early as 2-days and lasting to 28-days post administration. We also measured behavioral responses to the air-puff stimulus and found sex-dependent changes in threat responding but not exploratory behavior or general locomotion. Repeated presentations of the auditory component of the air-puff were also performed and sex-specific effects of psilocin on CeA reactivity to the auditory-alone stimulus were also observed.

Solid-state NMR (ssNMR) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) excel at resolving the rigid structures within amyloid cores but studying the dynamically disordered domains remains challenging. This challenge is exemplified by mutant huntingtin exon 1 (HttEx1), which self-assembles into pathogenic neuronal inclusions in Huntington disease (HD). The mutant proteins expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) segment forms a fibril core that is rigid and sequestered from the solvent. Beyond the core, solvent-exposed surface residues mediate biological interactions and other properties of fibril polymorphs. Here we deploy magic angle spinning ssNMR experiments to probe for semi-rigid residues proximal to the fibril core and examine how solvent dynamics impact the fibrils segmental dynamics. Dynamic spectral editing (DYSE) 2D ssNMR based on a combination of cross-polarization (CP) ssNMR with selective dipolar dephasing reveals the weak signals of solvent-mobilized glutamine residues, while suppressing the normally strong background of rigid core signals. This type of  intermediate motion selection (IMS) experiment based on cross-polarization (CP) ssNMR, is complementary to INEPT- and CP-based measurements that highlight highly flexible or highly rigid protein segments, respectively. Integration of the IMS-DYSE element in standard CP-based ssNMR experiments permits the observation of semi-rigid residues in a variety of contexts, including in membrane proteins and protein complexes.

CaMPARI has a unique property of irreversibly changing its color from green to red inside active neurons when illuminated with 400nm light. We capitalize on this property to demonstrate cortex-wide activity recording without any head fixation or attachment of a miniaturized device to the mouses head. Multiple cortical regions were recorded while the mouse was performing a battery of behavioral and cognitive tests. We identified task-dependent activity patterns across motor and somatosensory cortices, with significant differences across sub-regions of the motor cortex. This new CaMPARI-based recording method expands the capabilities of recording neuronal activity from freely-moving and behaving mice under minimally-restrictive experimental conditions and provides large-scale volumetric data that are not accessible otherwise.",

The immature and mature stromata, SFPs (with ascocarps) and ascospores were found to differentially contain several GC- and AT-biased genotypes of O. sinensis, Samsoniella hepiali, and an AB067719-type fungus. The genotypes within AT-biased Cluster-A in the Bayesian tree occurred in all compartments of C. sinensis, but those within AT-biased Cluster-B were present in immature and mature stromata and SPFs but absent in the ascospores. Genotype #13 of O. sinensis was present in semi-ejected ascospores and Genotype #14 in fully ejected ascospores. GC-biased Genotypes #13-14 featured large DNA segment substitutions and genetic material recombination between the genomes of the parental fungi (H. sinensis and the AB067719-type fungus). These ascosporic offspring genotypes combined with varying abundances of S. hepiali in the 2 types of ascospores participated in the control of the development, maturation and ejection of the ascospores.\n\nConclusionMultiple genotypes of O. sinensis coexist differentially in the stromata, SFPs and 2 types of C. sinensis ascospores, along with S. hepiali and the AB067719-type fungus. The fungal components in different combinations and their dynamic alterations in the compartments of C. sinensis during maturation play symbiotic roles in the lifecycle of natural C. sinensis.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are immune system proteins that protect the host by binding to specific antigens such as viruses and bacteria. The binding between antibodies and antigens is mainly determined by the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of the antibodies. In this work, we develop a deep generative model that jointly models sequences and structures of CDRs based on diffusion probabilistic models and equivariant neural networks. Our method is the first deep learning-based method that generates antibodies explicitly targeting specific antigen structures and is one of the earliest diffusion probabilistic models for protein structures. The model is a \"Swiss Army Knife\" capable of sequence-structure co-design, sequence design for given backbone structures, and antibody optimization. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the quality of both sequences and structures of designed antibodies. We find that our model could yield competitive results in binding affinity measured by biophysical energy functions and other protein design metrics.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the leading cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis worldwide. A distinctive feature of the O3:K6 pandemic clone, and its derivatives, is the presence of a second, phylogenetically distinct, Type III Secretion System (T3SS2) encoded within the genomic island VPaI-7. The T3SS2 allows the delivery of effector proteins directly into the cytosol of infected eukaryotic cells to subvert key host cell processes, critical for V. parahaemolyticus to colonize and cause disease. Furthermore, the T3SS2 also increases the environmental fitness of V. parahaemolyticus in its interaction with bacterivorous protists; hence it has been proposed that it contributed to the global oceanic spread of the pandemic clone. Several reports have identified T3SS2-related genes in Vibrio and non-Vibrio species, suggesting that the T3SS2 gene cluster is not restricted to the Vibrionaceae and can mobilize through horizontal gene transfer events. In this work, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis to determine the phylogenetic distribution of the T3SS2 gene cluster and its repertoire of effector proteins. We identified putative T3SS2 gene clusters in 1130 bacterial genomes from 8 bacterial genera, 5 bacterial families and 47 bacterial species. A hierarchical clustering analysis allowed us to define 6 T3SS2 subgroups (I-VI) with different repertoires of effector proteins, redefining the concepts of T3SS2 core and accessory effector proteins. Finally, we identified a subset of T3SS2 gene clusters (subgroup VI) that lack most T3SS2 effector proteins described to date and provided a list of 10 novel effector candidates for this subgroup through bioinformatic analysis. Collectively, our findings indicate that the T3SS2 extends beyond the Vibrionaceae family and suggest that different effector protein repertories could have a differential impact on the pathogenic potential and environmental fitness of each bacteria that have acquired the Vibrio T3SS2 gene cluster.\n\nDATA SUMMARYO_LIAll genome sequences used in this study were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) RefSeq or GenBank databases (See Table S1 for accession numbers).\nC_LIO_LIFiles for the T3SS2 reconstructed phylogenetic tree (Newick tree and MSA fasta file), hierarchical clustering data analysis file from MORPHEUS, Table S1 with genome accession numbers and all the data of the absence/presence of T3SS2-related components, and Table S2 with the prediction of novel effector proteins are available as part of the online Supporting Dataset at the Zenodo data repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7016552).

Currently available repellents for personal or household protection are limited in their efficacy, applicability, and safety profile. Here, we describe a machine-learning-driven high-throughput method for the discovery of novel repellent molecules. To achieve this, we digitized a large, historic dataset containing [~]19,000 mosquito repellency measurements. We then trained a graph neural network (GNN) to map molecular structure and repellency. We applied this model to select 317 candidate molecules to test in parallelizable behavioral assays, quantifying repellency in multiple pest species and in follow-up trials with human volunteers. The GNN approach outperformed a chemoinformatic model and produced a hit rate that increased with training data size, suggesting that both model innovation and novel data collection were integral to predictive accuracy. We identified >10 molecules with repellency similar to or greater than the most widely used repellents.

    "abstract": "Molecular cloning is a routine yet essential technique. Its efficiency relies on ligation and can be greatly improved when using a procedure known as Golden Gate Assembly (GGA). Essential to GGA are type IIS enzymes that have the unique property to cleave downstream their recognition sequence and thus generate any non-palindromic overhangs. Today, GGA benefits from new engineered enzymes with enhanced activity. Concomitantly, high throughput GGA assays (involving the simultaneous study of all overhangs at a time) have proposed optimal GGA substrates with high efficiencies and fidelities. Surprisingly, those assays show either no or unexpected correlation between ligation efficiencies and overhang stabilities. To explain those observations, we present here experiments involving one or two substrates (overhangs) only. When performing GGA at a stable temperature of 37{degrees}C, we found that GGA efficiency strongly correlates with overhang stability. Combining those experimental results with a kinetic model, we were able to determine how relevant parameters (time, temperature, molarity, stoichiometry, stacking energy) influence GGA. This work provides a comprehensive view of low-assembly GGA, defines the required optimal conditions and substrates (allowing the fabrication of constructs for single-molecule experiments with unprecedented yields) and gives new insights into DNA ligation that are crucial in biology.",

    "abstract": "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited progressive metabolic disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the ABCD1 gene, which leads to accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in body fluids and tissues including brain and spinal cord. In the absence of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation the molecular mechanisms of the severe cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD) and the milder adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) phenotypes remain unknown. Given our previous evidence of role of astrocytes in the neuroinflammatory response in X-ALD we investigated the metabolic and molecular profiles of astrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). The iPSCs were in turn generated from skin fibroblasts from healthy controls and patients with AMN or cALD. AMN and cALD astrocytes exhibited lack of ABCD1 and accumulation of very long chain fatty acids, a hallmark of X-ALD disease. Further, cALD astrocytes harbor significantly higher phosphorylation of STAT3, increased Toll-like receptor expression and higher chemokine and cytokine expression. In this first report of miRNA sequencing in X-ALD astrocytes, we observed that miR-9 expression was associated with increasing disease severity phenotype. CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in of ABCD1ABCD1 gene expression differentially affected the expression of key molecular, metabolic and microRNA targets in AMN and cALD astrocytes. Extensive characterization of the AMN and cALD iPSC-derived astrocyte model demonstrates critical aspects of X-ALD inflammatory disease in response to ABCD1ABCD1 mutation and can be further utilized for exploring the contribution of astrocytes to differential inflammatory response in cALD.",

    "abstract": "Antipsychotics share the common pharmacological feature of antagonizing the dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) which is abundant in the striatum and involved in both the therapeutic and side effects of this drugs class. Pharmacological blockade of striatal D2R, by disinhibiting the D2R-containing medium-size spiny neurons (MSNs), leads to a plethora of molecular, cellular and behavioral adaptations which are central in the action of antipsychotics. Here, we focused on the cell type-specific (D2R-MSNs) regulation of some striatal immediate early genes (IEGs), such as cFos, Arc and Zif268. Taking advantage of transgenic mouse models, pharmacological approaches and immunofluorescence analyses, we found that haloperidol-induced IEGs in the striatum required the synergistic activation of A2a (adenosine) and NMDA (glutamate) receptors. At the intracellular signaling level, we found that the PKA/DARPP-32 and mTOR pathways synergistically cooperate to control the induction of IEGs by haloperidol. By confirming and further expanding previous observations, our results provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the molecular/cellular action of antipsychotics in the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are readily used to capture the stochasticity in tumour evolution; however, these models are often challenging to validate with experimental measurements due to model complexity. The Voronoi cell-based model (VCBM) is an off-lattice agent-based model that captures individual cell shapes using a Voronoi tessellation and mimics the evolution of cancer cell proliferation and movement. Evidence suggests tumours can exhibit biphasic growth in vivo. To account for this phenomena, we extend the VCBM to capture the existence of two distinct growth phases. Prior work primarily focused on point estimation for the parameters without consideration of estimating uncertainty. In this paper, approximate Bayesian computation is employed to calibrate the model to in vivo measurements of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Our approach involves estimating the distribution of parameters that govern cancer cell proliferation and recovering outputs that match the experimental data. Our results show that the VCBM, and its biphasic extension, provides insight into tumour growth and quantifies uncertainty in the switching time between the two phases of the biphasic growth model. We find this approach enables precise estimates for the time taken for a daughter cell to become a mature cell. This allows us to propose future refinements to the model to improve accuracy, whilst also making conclusions about the differences in cancer cell characteristics.",

Despite this intricate relationship, it is still unclear how a deregulation of sugar transport impacts N allocation. Here we investigated, in Arabidopsis, the consequences of the simultaneous downregulation of the genes coding for the sugar transporters SWEET11, SWEET12, SWEET16, and SWEET17 genes on various anatomical and physiological traits ranging from the stems vascular system development, plant biomass production, seed yield, and N remobilisation and use efficiency. Our results show that intracellular sugar exchanges mediated by SWEET16 and SWEET17 proteins specifically impact the vascular development but do not play a significant role in the distribution of N. Most importantly, we showed that the double mutant swt11swt12, which is also impacted in the vascular development, displays an improved nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen remobilisation to the seeds. In addition, a significant negative correlation between sugar and amino acids contents and the inflorescence stem radial growth exists, highlighting the complex interaction between the maintenance of C/N homeostasis and the inflorescence stem development. Our results thus deepen the link between sugar transport, C/N allocation and vascular system development.\n\nHighlightThe disruption of genes coding for SWEET11 and SWEET12 sugar transporters negatively impacts the stem development but improves the plant nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen remobilisation to the seeds.",

    "abstract": "Recently a biochemistry experiment was developed to simultaneously capture the chromosomal conformations and DNA methylation levels on single cells. A computational tool to predict single-cell methylation levels based on single-cell Hi-C data becomes necessary due to the availability of this experiment. scHiMe was developed to predict the base-pair-specific methylation levels in the promoter regions genome-wide based on the single-cell Hi-C data and DNA nucleotide sequences using the graph transformer algorithm. Promoter-promoter spatial interaction networks were built based on single-cell Hi-C data, and single-cell DNA methylation levels on 1000 base pairs for each promoter were predicted based on the network topology and DNA sequence. Our evaluation results showed a high consistency between the predicted and the true methylation values. We tested using predicted DNA methylation levels on all promoters to classify cells into different cell types, and our results showed that the predicted DNA methylation levels resulted in almost perfect cell-type classification, which indicated that our predictions maintained the cell-to-cell variability. We also tested using the predicted DNA methylation levels of different subsets of promoters and different subsets of CpGs in promoters to classify cells and provided the promoters and CpGs that were most influential in cell-type clustering. Moreover, we observed slightly better performance for the nodes that have higher degree values in the promoter-promoter spatial interaction network but did not find a similar trend for more significant network influencers. Last but not least, we found that using the predicted methylation levels of only housekeeping genes led to less accurate cell-type clustering, which demonstrated that our methylation predictions fit the biological meanings of housekeeping genes since housekeeping genes usually have constant and similar genetic and epigenetic features among different types of cells. scHiMe is freely available at http://dna.cs.miami.edu/scHiMe/.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA methylation is the process of adding methyl groups to the DNA molecule without changing the nucleotide sequence, which can significantly change the activities of the DNA. Although DNA is a one-dimensional long sequence consisting of cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), and thymine (T), it folds into a three-dimensional structure in the nucleus of the cell. Scientists believe that this 3D structure has relationships with the activities of the DNA. This research uses deep learning to predict the DNA methylation status of each cytosine-guanine pair in the promoter regions of all human genes based on the 3D structure of the DNA. This not only adds a useful method to the computational biology field but also proves that 3D genome structure does have a relationship with DNA methylation. Moreover, the 3D genome and the DNA methylation are not based on a population of cells, but on individual cells, which provides a cell-specific perspective that allows the understanding of cell-to-cell variability.",

    "abstract": "Within the first years of life, children learn major aspects of their native language. However, the ability to process complex sentence structures, a core faculty in human language called syntax, has been found to emerge only slowly. A milestone in the acquisition of syntax is reached around the age of 4, when children learn a variety of syntactic concepts, including, for example, subordinate clauses. Here, we ask which maturational changes in the childs brain underlie the emergence of syntactic abilities around this critical age. We relate markers of cortical brain maturation to 3- and 4-year-olds syntactic in contrast to other language abilities. Our results show that distinct cortical brain areas support syntax in the two age groups: While 3-year-old childrens syntactic abilities were associated with increased surface area in the most posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus, 4-year-old children showed an association with cortical thickness in the left posterior part of Brocas area, i.e. BA44. The present findings suggest that syntactic abilities rely on the maturation of distinct cortical regions in 3- compared to 4-year-olds. The observed shift to more mature regions involved in syntax may underlie the behavioral milestones in syntax acquisition around 4 years of age.",

Still, the relationship between AF lateralization and literacy skills in DD remains largely unknown. The purpose of our study is to investigate the relationship between the lateralization of the AF anterior segment (AFAS), AF long segment (AFLS), and AF posterior segment (AFPS) in connection to literacy skills in DD. The participants included 26 children with dyslexia and 31 age-matched children in the control group. High angular diffusion imaging, combined with spherical deconvolution tractography, was used to reconstruct the AF. Connectivity measures of hindrance-modulated oriented anisotropy (HMOA) were computed for each of the three segments of the AF: anterior segment (AFAS), long segment (AFLS), and posterior segment (AFPS). The lateralization index (LI) of each AF segment was calculated by (right HMOA - left HMOA) / (right HMOA + left HMOA). Results showed that the LIs of AFAS and AFLS were positively correlated with reading accuracy in children with dyslexia. Specifically, the LI of AFAS was positively correlated with text and nonword reading accuracy, while the LI of AFLS accounted for word reading accuracy. The results suggest adaptive compensation of arcuate fasciculus lateralization in developmental dyslexia and functional dissociation of the anterior segment and long segment in the compensation.",

Hierarchical clustering analyses suggest heterogeneity in the CO networks task response properties, with one sub-system (CO1) showing consistency with prior task control characterizations while another sub-system (CO2) has weak task control responses, but preserved ties to pain and motor functions. Resting-state connectivity confirms subtle differences in the architecture of these two sub-systems. This evidence suggests that, when individual variation in network locations is addressed, the CO network includes (at least) two linked sub-systems with differential roles in task control and other cognitive/motor/interoceptive responses, which may help explain varied accounts of its functions. We propose that this fractionation may reflect expansion of primary CO body-oriented control functions to broader domain-general contexts.",

    "abstract": "Despite their anatomical and functional distinctions, there is growing evidence that the dorsal and ventral visual pathways interact to support object recognition. However, the exact nature of these interactions remains poorly understood. Is the presence of identity-relevant object information in the dorsal pathway simply a byproduct of ventral input? Or, might the dorsal pathway be a source of input to the ventral pathway for object recognition? In the current study, we used high-density EEG - a technique with high temporal precision and spatial resolution sufficient to distinguish parietal and temporal lobes - to characterize the dynamics of dorsal and ventral pathways during object viewing. Using multivariate analyses, we found that category decoding in the dorsal pathway preceded that in the ventral pathway. Importantly, the dorsal pathway predicted the multivariate responses of the ventral pathway in a time-dependent manner, rather than the other way around. Together, these findings suggest that the dorsal pathway is a critical source of input to the ventral pathway for object recognition.",

    "abstract": "Jumbo bacteriophages of the [ovbar]KZ-like family are characterized by large genomes (>200 kb) and the remarkable ability to assemble a proteinaceous nucleus-like structure. The nucleus protects the phage genome from canonical DNA-targeting immune systems, such as CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification. We hypothesized that the failure of common bacterial defenses creates selective pressure for immune systems that target the unique jumbo phage biology. Here, we identify the \"jumbo phage killer\" (Juk) immune system that is deployed by a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to resist [ovbar]KZ. Juk immunity rescues the cell by preventing early phage transcription, DNA replication, and nucleus assembly. Phage infection is first sensed by JukA (formerly YaaW), which localizes rapidly to the site of phage infection at the cell pole, triggered by ejected phage factors. The effector protein JukB is recruited by JukA, which is required to enable immunity and the subsequent degradation of the phage DNA. JukA homologs are found in several bacterial phyla and are associated with numerous other putative effectors, many of which provided specific anti-[ovbar]KZ activity when expressed in P. aeruginosa. Together, these data reveal a novel strategy for immunity whereby immune factors are recruited to the site of phage protein and DNA ejection to prevent phage progression and save the cell.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is an opportunistic, encapsulated, yeast-like fungus that causes severe meningoencephalitis, especially in countries with high HIV prevalence. In addition to its well-known polysaccharide capsule, Cn has other virulence factors such as phospholipases, a heterogeneous group of enzymes that hydrolyze ester linkages in glycerophospholipids. Phospholipase B (PLB1) has been demonstrated to play a key role in Cn pathogenicity. In this study, we used a PLB1 mutant (plb1) and its reconstituted strain (Rec1) to assess the importance of this enzyme on Cn brain infection in vivo and in vitro. Mice infected with plb1 strain survive significantly longer, have lower central nervous system (CNS) fungal load, and fewer and smaller cryptococcomas or biofilm-like brain lesions compared to H99- and Rec1-infected animals. plb1 cryptococci are significantly more phagocytosed and killed by NR-9460 microglia-like cells. plb1 cells have altered capsular polysaccharide biophysical properties that impair their ability to stimulate glia cell responses or morphological changes. We provide significant evidence demonstrating that Cn phospholipase is an important virulence factor for fungal colonization of and survival in the CNS as well as in the progression of cryptococcal meningitis. These findings may potentially help fill in a gap of knowledge in our understanding of cerebral cryptococcosis and may provide novel research avenues in Cn pathogenesis.\n\nIMPORTANCECryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a serious disease caused by infection of the neurotropic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn). Due to the increasing number of cases in HIV-infected individuals, as well as the limited therapies available, investigation into potential targets for new therapeutics has become critical. Phospholipase B (PLB1) is an enzyme synthesized by Cn that confers virulence to the fungus through capsular enlargement, immunomodulation, and intracellular replication. In this study, we examined the properties of PLB1 by comparing infection of Cn PLB1 mutant strain with both the wild-type and a PLB1 reconstituted strain. We show that PLB1 augments the survival and proliferation of the fungus in the CNS and strengthens virulence through modulation of the immune response and enhancement of specific biophysical properties of the fungus. The implications of PLB1 inhibition reveal its involvement in Cn infection and suggest that it may be a possible molecular target in the development of antifungal therapies. The results of this study support additional investigation into the mechanism of PLB1 to further understand the intricacies of Cn infection.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria employ photoreceptors called cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) to sense the colour and intensity of light. The information extracted from the solar spectrum is used for adaptive responses such as optimizing photosynthesis, phototaxis and cell aggregation. GAF domains are the principal light sensors in cyanobacteriochromes. They contain a conjugated bilin chromophore and boast an impressive spectral diversity. Characterizing the spectral characteristics of GAF domains in model strains, such as Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, can open new avenues for optogenetics and biotechnology. Based on sequence analysis we predicted several different GAF domains in this strain. The 7GP-03 gene encodes a single GAF domain with two Cys residues: one in the conserved 3 helix; one in the conserved DXCF motif. Spectral analysis of recombinant 7GP-03 with phycocyanobilin (PCB) showed that the protein cycles between two states, Po and Pb, which absorb orange and blue light, respectively. Acid-denaturation analysis showed that the 15E isomer of PCB was bound in the (dark) Po state, whereas 15Z is in the (photoproduct) Pb state. Site-directed mutagenesis of the DXCF motif and iodoacetamide treatments showed that Cys73 in the DXCF motif is essential for the conversion from Po to Pb. The predicted thiol link formation between Cys73 and C10 of PCB is the first sequence of events in the photocycle, followed by PCB isomerization from 15E to 15Z. 7GP-03 is interesting from the perspective of colour perception in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 but also due to its 15E state being the holoproteins dark state.",

After infection, temperate phages can integrate in the bacterial chromosome thanks to the expression of the prophage-encoded CI master repressor. Upon SOS induction, and promoted by RecA*, CI auto-cleaves generating two fragments, one containing the N-terminal domain (NTD), which retains strong DNA-binding capacity, and other corresponding to the C-terminal part of the protein. However, it is unknown how the CI NTD is removed, a process that is essential to allow prophage induction. Here we identify for the first time that the specific interaction of the ClpX protease with the CI NTD repressor fragment is essential and sufficient for prophage activation after SOS-mediated CI autocleavage, defining the final stage in the prophage induction cascade.

    "abstract": "Synthesis of RNA molecules that contain an internal site-specific modification is important for RNA research and therapeutics. While solid-state synthesis is attainable for such RNA in the range of 100 nucleotides (nts), it is currently impossible with kilobase (kb)-long RNA. Instead, long RNA with an internal modification is usually assembled in an enzymatic 3-part splint ligation to join a short RNA oligonucleotide, containing the site-specific modification, with both a left-arm and a right-arm long RNA that are synthesized by in vitro transcription. However, long RNAs have structural heterogeneity and those synthesized by in vitro transcription have 3-end sequence heterogeneity, which together substantially reduce the yield of 3-part splint ligation. Here we describe a method of 3-part splint ligation with an enhanced efficiency utilizing a ribozyme cleavage reaction to address the 3-end sequence heterogeneity and involving DNA disruptors proximal to the ligation sites to address the structural heterogeneity. The yields of the synthesized kb-long RNA are sufficiently high to afford purification to homogeneity for practical RNA research. We also verify the sequence accuracy at each ligation junction by nanopore sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Numerous technical advances have made cryo-EM an attractive method for atomic structure determination. Cryo-EM is ideally suited for large macromolecular structures, while problems of low signal-to-noise prevent routine structure determination of proteins smaller than about 50 kDa. This size limitation excludes large numbers of important cellular proteins from structural characterization by this powerful technique, including many cell-signaling proteins of high therapeutic interest. In the present work, we use molecular engineering techniques to rigidify an imaging scaffold, based on a designed protein cage, to the point where 3 [A] resolution can be achieved, even for very small proteins. After optimizing the design of the rigidified scaffold on test proteins, we apply this imaging system to the key oncogenic signaling protein KRAS, which represents an outstanding challenge in the area of structure-based drug design. Despite its 19 kDa size, we show that the structure of KRAS, in multiple mutant forms, and bound to its GDP ligand, can be readily interpreted at a resolution slightly better than 3.0 [A]. This advance further expands the capability of cryo-EM to become an essentially universal method for protein structure determination, including for applications to small therapeutic protein targets.",

    "abstract": "Systemic pan-tumor analyses may reveal the significance of common features implicated in cancer immunogenicity and patient survival. Here, we provide a comprehensive multi-omics data set for 32 patients across 25 tumor types by combining proteogenomics with phenotypic and functional analyses. By using an optimized computational approach, we discovered a large number of novel tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens including shared common target candidates. To create a pipeline for the identification of neoantigens in our cohort, we combined deep DNA and RNA sequencing with MS- based immunopeptidomics of tumor specimens, followed by the assessment of their immunogenicity. In fact, we could detect a broad variety of non-wild type HLA-binding peptides in the majority of patients and confirmed the immunogenicity of 24 neoantigens. Most interestingly, the majority of total and immunogenic neoantigens originated from variants identified in the RNA dataset, illustrating the importance of RNA as a still understudied source of cancer antigens. Moreover, the amount of these mainly RNA-based immunogenic neoantigens correlated positively with overall CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells. This study therefore underlines the importance of RNA-centered variant detection for the identification of shared biomarkers and potentially relevant neoantigen candidates.\n\nStatement of significanceThe significance of this study lies not only in the potential of our optimized proteogenomic workflow for the discovery of neoantigens (in particular RNA-derived neoantigens) for clinical application, but sheds light on the entity-agnostic prevalence of HLA class I peptide presentation of RNA processing events to be used for tumor targeting.",

Here, we developed multiple models of acquired resistance to dual-mechanism ERK/MAPK inhibitors across KRAS-mutant pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers, and then probed the long-term events enabling survival against this novel class of drugs. These studies revealed that resistance emerges secondary to large-scale transcriptional adaptations that are diverse and tumor-specific. Transcriptional reprogramming extends beyond the well-established early response, and instead represents a dynamic, evolved population-level process that is refined to attain a stably resistant phenotype. Mechanistic and translational studies reveal that resistance to dual-mechanism ERK/MAPK inhibition is broadly susceptible to manipulation of the epigenetic machinery, and that Mediator kinase, in particular, can be co-targeted at a bottleneck point to prevent diverse, tumor-specific resistance programs.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for most cases. Despite advances in cancer therapeutics, the 5-year survival rate has remained poor due to several contributing factors, including its resistance to therapeutics. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop therapeutics that can overcome resistance. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), have been found to contribute to cancer resistance and therapeutics by modulating the expression of several targets involving multiple key mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of miR-129 modified with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in NSCLC. Our results show that 5-FU modified miR-129 (5-FU-miR-129) inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, and retains function as a miRNA in NSCLC cell lines A549 and Calu-1. Notably, we observed that 5-FU-miR-129 was able to overcome resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chemotherapy in cell lines resistant to erlotinib or 5-FU. Furthermore, we observed that the inhibitory effect of 5-FU-miR-129 can also be achieved in NSCLC cells under vehicle-free conditions. Finally, 5-FU-miR-129 inhibited NSCLC tumor growth and extended survival in vivo without toxic side effects. Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential of 5-FU-miR-129 as a highly potent cancer therapeutic in NSCLC.",

While eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4E are well-known to contribute to the progression of many cancer types including metastatic breast cancers, the role played by eIF4B in breast cancer remains relatively unclear. We therefore explored how naturally divergent and experimentally modulated eIF4B levels impact tumor growth and progression in well-characterized murine triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. Surprisingly, we found that higher eIF4B levels in mouse and human breast cancers were associated with less aggressive phenotypes. shRNA-mediated eIF4B knockdown in TNBC lines failed to markedly alter proliferation and global translation in the cells in vitro and only modestly hindered their growth as primary mammary tumors growth in mice. However, eIF4B knockdown significantly enhanced invasive growth in vitro and exacerbated both tumor burden and mortality relative to nontargeting shRNA controls in a model of metastatic disease. Analysis of eIF4B levels and breast cancer patient survival reinforced a link to better outcomes. Interestingly, low eIF4B expression was also associated with more formidable immune evasion in vitro and in vivo, implicating a novel immunomodulatory role for this factor in the malignant setting that suggests a mode of action beyond its historical role as a co-activator of eIF4A/F.\n\nSignificance StatementMetastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Despite many advances in our understanding of this complex process and the molecular and cellular events involved, mechanisms that allow secondary tumors to arise and persist remain incompletely understood. Uncharacterized metastatic determinants active at the level of translational control may be exploitable as novel therapy targets or biomarkers predicting a tumors potential for spread and recurrence. Here we describe previously unrecognized consequences of dysregulated eIF4B levels in murine breast cancer that shed light on how this translation initiation factor contributes to disease outcomes. Our findings suggest that eIF4B levels direct metastatic risk and immune evasion, and further study should establish its value in personalized treatment decisions and development of future therapies.",

    "abstract": "In the human gut, the growth of Clostridioides difficile is impacted by a complex web of inter-species interactions with members of human gut microbiota. We investigate the contribution of inter-species interactions on the antibiotic response of C. difficile to clinically relevant antibiotics using bottom-up assembly of human gut communities. We discover two classes of microbial interactions that alter C. difficiles antibiotic susceptibility: infrequent increases in tolerance at high antibiotic concentrations and frequent growth enhancements at low antibiotic concentrations. Based on genome-wide transcriptional profiling data, we demonstrate that metal sequestration due to hydrogen sulfide production by the prevalent gut species Desulfovibrio piger increases metronidazole tolerance of C. difficile. Competition with species that display higher sensitivity to the antibiotic than C. difficile leads to enhanced growth of C. difficile at low antibiotic concentrations. A dynamic computational model identifies the ecological design principles driving this effect. Our results provide a deeper understanding of ecological and molecular principles shaping C. difficiles response to antibiotics, which could inform therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Between 1990 and 1999, at Rekomitjie Research Station, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, 29,360 female G. pallidipes were dissected to determine their ovarian category and trypanosome infection status. Overall prevalences were 3.45% and 2.66% for T. vivax and T. congolense, respectively, declining during each year as temperatures increased from July - December. Fits to age-prevalence data using Susceptible-Exposed-Infective (SEI) and SI compartmental models were statistically better than those obtained using a published catalytic model, which made the unrealistic assumption that no female tsetse survived more than seven ovulations. The improved models require knowledge of fly mortality, estimated separately from ovarian age distributions. Infection rates were not significantly higher for T. vivax than for T. congolense. For T. congolense in field-sampled female G. pallidipes, we found no statistical support for a model where the force of infection was higher at the first feed than subsequently. The long survival of adult female tsetse, combined with feeding at intervals [&le;] 3 days, ensures that post-teneral feeds, rather than the first feed, play the dominant role in the epidemiology of T. congolense infections in G. pallidipes. This is supported by estimates that only about 3% of wild hosts at Rekomitjie were harbouring sufficient T. congolense to ensure that tsetse feeding off them take an infected meal, so that the probability of ingesting an infected meal is low at every meal.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian circadian rhythms are coordinated by the master clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Under severe environmental conditions, such as during the harsh winter season for food, certain mammalian species reduce their basal metabolism and thermogenesis, thereby undergoing torpor, a controlled state of hypothermia, which naturally returns to the normothermic state. A long-lasting debate focused on whether the SCN with a temperature-compensated clock remains functional during hypothermia. However, so far, no direct and quantitative evidence has been reported of temperature sensitivity in living SCN neurons.\n\nIn this study, we performed dual-color fluorescence imaging of clock gene transcriptions and intracellular Ca2+ in mouse SCN neurons, using slices at various temperatures. We demonstrated that the Bmal1 transcription and Ca2+ circadian rhythms persisted at 22{degrees}C-28{degrees}C, although the two rhythms underwent temporal dissociation at 22 {degrees}C. Notably, Ca2+, Bmal1, and Per2 rhythms were suspended at 15{degrees}C, coupled with a significant Ca2+ increase, and all rhythms were reset by rewarming to 35{degrees}C. Upon rewarming, the Ca2+ rhythm showed stable oscillations immediately, whereas the Bmal1 and Per2 rhythms took several days to reach stable oscillations and recover their phase relationship with the Ca2+ rhythm.\n\nTaken together, we concluded that SCN neurons remain functional under moderate hypothermic conditions at approximately 22{degrees}C-28{degrees}C but stop ticking time in deep hypothermia at 15{degrees}C and that the rhythms reset after deep hypothermia. These data also indicate that the stable Ca2+ oscillation precedes clock gene transcriptional rhythms in the SCN neurons.",

Recently, there were cases reported in Guinea and Ghana highlighting this virus as a high-consequence pathogen potentially threatening global public health. There are no licensed treatments or vaccines available today.\n\nWe used a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine expressing the MARV-Angola glycoprotein (VSV-MARV) as the viral antigen. Previously, a single dose of 1x107 plaque-forming units (PFU) administered 7 days before challenge resulted in uniform protection from disease in cynomolgus macaques. Here, we sought to lower the vaccination dose to allow for more doses per vial in an emergency outbreak situation. We administered 1x105 or 1x103 PFU 14 days before challenge and achieved uniform protection in both groups. When we administered 1x103 PFU 7 days before challenge, vaccination resulted in uniform protection with no detectable viremia. Antigen-specific IgG responses were induced by both vaccine concentrations and were sustained until the study endpoint. Neutralizing antibody responses and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis were observed with both vaccination doses and timelines. The cellular response after vaccination was characterized by early induction of NK cell activation. Additionally, antigen-specific memory T cell subsets were detected in all vaccination cohorts indicating that while the primary protective mechanism of VSV-MARV is the humoral response, a functional cellular response is also induced.\n\nOverall, this data highlights VSV-MARV as a viable and fast-acting MARV vaccine candidate suitable for deployment in emergency outbreak situations and supports its clinical development.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA single low dose of VSV-MARV administered 14 or 7 days before challenge protects NHPs uniformly from lethal disease.",

Increased IL-10 production by neonatal B cells has been attributed to the larger population of IL-10-producting CD43+ B-1 cells in neonates. Here, we show that neonatal CD43- non-B-1 cells also produce substantial amounts of IL-10 following B cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation. In neonatal CD43- non-B-1 cells, BCR engagement activated STAT5 under the control of phosphorylated forms of signaling molecules Syk, Btk, PKC, FAK and Rac1. STAT5 activation led to IL-6 production, which in turn was responsible for IL-10 production in an autocrine/paracrine fashion through the activation of STAT3. In addition to the increased IL-6 production in response to BCR stimulation, elevated expression of IL-6R expression in neonatal B cells rendered them highly susceptible to IL-6 mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-10 production. Finally, IL-10 secreted from neonatal CD43- non-B-1 cells was sufficient to inhibit TNF- secretion by macrophages. Our results unveil a distinct mechanism of IL-6-dependent IL-10 production in BCR-stimulated neonatal CD19+CD43- B cells.",

    "abstract": "Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a pleiotropic serine/threonine kinase whose localized and dynamic activity is required for cellular migration. Several cell types have shown robust PKA activity in the leading edge during migration. This activity is regulated by changes in actomyosin contractility, but the mechanism of the mechanochemical regulation of PKA remains unclear. Our ongoing investigation into this mechanism led us to discover a novel relationship between PKA and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). Here, we find that while inhibition of actomyosin contractility leads to a relatively slow decrease in total cellular levels of phosphorylated FAK over tens of minutes, it decreases the focal adhesion-associated pool of both phospho-FAK and phospho-paxillin within two minutes, similar to the timing of the effect of inhibition of contractility on leading edge PKA activity. We then show that pharmacologic inhibition of FAK rapidly decreases leading edge PKA activity. Additionally, leading edge PKA activity is significantly reduced in FAK-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and essentially eliminated by also silencing expression of the closely-related kinase Pyk2 in these cells. Importantly, leading edge PKA activity in FAK-null cells is rescued by re-expression of wild-type but not kinase-dead FAK. Taken together, these observations show that FAK activity is required for localized regulation of PKA during cell migration and, in so doing, establish a novel and unexpected connection between an adhesion-regulated tyrosine kinase and a serine/threonine kinase canonically downstream of G-protein coupled receptor and second-messenger signaling.",

To drive the rapid cell cycles of the early embryo, however, excess histones are maternally deposited. Therefore, soluble histones must be buffered by histone chaperones but the chaperone necessary to stabilize soluble H3-H4 pools in the Drosophila embryo has yet to be identified. Here, we show that CG8223, the Drosophila ortholog of NASP, is a H3-H4-specific chaperone in the early embryo. NASP specifically binds to H3-H4 in the early embryo. We demonstrate that, while a NASP null mutant is viable in Drosophila, NASP is maternal effect lethal gene. Embryos laid by NASP mutant mothers have a reduce rate of hatching and show defects in early embryogenesis. Critically, soluble H3-H4 pools are degraded in embryos laid by NASP mutant mothers. Our work identifies NASP as the critical H3-H4 histone chaperone in the Drosophila embryo.",

    "abstract": "The Groucho/Transducin-Like Enhancer of split (Gro/TLE) family proteins act as corepressors for many transcription factors that act in several key pathways during development and cancer. Recent studies have shown that Gro is enriched at a subset of genes that exhibit RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) pausing in Drosophila melanogaster cells and that depletion of Gro can lead to pause release. Here we compare Gro requirement across three cell lines and find that although Gro target sites are largely cell-type specific, Gro is recruited across a similar profile of genomic features. Gro recruitment frequently overlaps that of general factors which promote RNAP II pausing but it does not preclude recruitment of factors that mediate release of paused RNAP II, indicating that Gro restricts the activity of pause release factors rather than their recruitment. Genetic interaction analyses reveal that the association of Gro with factors known to promote RNAP II pausing in Drosophila cell lines reflects a functional relationship in vivo. Knock-down of factors that promote RNAP II pausing enhance gro knock-down phenotypes during wing vein patterning. However, knocking down these factors in the eye concurrently with gro had different effects on patterning (enhancement) and growth (rescue), indicating that the molecular mechanisms underlying Gro function differ in these two processes. Our results identify a mechanism through which developmentally regulated transcription factors can establish RNAP II pausing to modulate transcription.",

We create multi-species \"super-pangenomes\" using pggb, cactus, and minigraph with the Bos taurus taurus reference sequence and eleven haplotype-resolved assemblies from taurine and indicine cattle, bison, yak, and gaur. We recover 221k nonredundant structural variations (SVs) from the pangenomes, of which 135k (61%) are common to all three. SVs derived from assembly-based calling show high agreement with the consensus calls from the pangenomes (96%), but validate only a small proportion of variations private to each graph. Pggb and cactus, which also incorporate base-level variation, have approximately 95% exact matches with assembly-derived small variant calls, which significantly improves the edit rate when realigning assemblies compared to minigraph. We use the three pangenomes to investigate 9,566 variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), finding 63% have identical predicted repeat counts in the three graphs, while minigraph can over or underestimate the count given its approximate coordinate system. We examine a highly variable VNTR locus and show that repeat unit copy number impacts expression of proximal genes and non-coding RNA. Our findings indicate good consensus between the three pangenome methods but also show their individual strengths and weaknesses that need to be considered when analysing different types of variants from multiple input assemblies.",

    "abstract": "The tempo and mode of colonization of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) by Cannabis sativa, its further internal spreading and the potential cultural and environmental factors involved remain unknown. The available continental-wide European meta-analyses using pollen and archaeological evidence account for only a few IP sites, insufficient for a sound assessment. This paper presents a nearly comprehensive database of almost 60 IP sites with palynological evidence of Cannabis and analyzes the corresponding spatiotemporal patterns. The first scattered records of this pollen type, likely corresponding to wild Cannabis, date from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic (150 to 12 ky BP) and would have entered the IP by maritime Mediterranean or terrestrial continental pathways, or both. A first burst of introductions, probably in a cultivated form, would have occurred during the Neolithic (7-5 ky BP) using similar paths. Human participation in this Neolithic acceleration remains unclear but cannot be dismissed. A period of reduced Cannabis arrivals (mostly via MP) occurred between the Chalcolithic and the Roman Epoch (4.5-2 ky BP), when the innermost parts of the IP were colonized (Late Bronze). A second, likely anthropogenic, introduction acceleration took place in the Middle Ages (1.5 ky BP onward) using the MP and CP. Maximum cultivation and hemp retting activity was recorded during the Modern Ages (16th-19th centuries), coinciding with the increased demand of hemp fiber to supply the Spanish royal navy for imperial expansion and commerce. A potential link between Cannabis colonization/introduction bursts and climatic warmings has been observed that should be tested with future studies. Regional moisture variations seem to be less influential. Further efforts to enhance and improve the database used in this study are encouraged. The results of this paper should be compared with archaeological and historical evidence to clarify the role of human migrations and cultural changes in the historical biogeography of Cannabis in the IP.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSEWearable tracking glasses record eye movements and fixations as ambulatory subjects navigate their environment. We tested the performance of eye tracking glasses under laboratory and real world conditions, to characterize the vergence behavior of normal individuals engaged in their customary daily pursuits.\n\nMETHODSTo define the accuracy and variability of the eye tracking glasses, 4 subjects fixated with the head stabilized at a series of distances corresponding to vergence demands of: 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32{degrees}. Then, 10 subjects wore the eye tracking glasses for prolonged periods while carrying out their normal activities. Vergence profiles were compiled for each subject and compared with interpupillary distance.\n\nRESULTSIn the laboratory the eye tracking glasses were comparable in accuracy to remote video eye trackers, outputting a mean vergence value within 1{degrees} of demand at all angles except 32{degrees}. In ambulatory subjects the glasses were less accurate, due to tracking interruptions and measurement errors, only partly mitigated by application of data filters. Nonetheless, a useful record of vergence behavior was obtained in every subject. Vergence angle often had a bimodal distribution, reflecting a preponderance of activities at near (mobile phone, computer) or far (driving, walking). Vergence angle was highly correlated with interpupillary distance.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWearable eye tracking glasses provide a history of vergence angle and the corresponding scene witnessed by ambulatory subjects. They offer insight into the diversity of human ocular motor behavior and may become useful for diagnosis of disorders that affect vergence, such as convergence insufficiency, Parkinson disease, and strabismus.",

    "abstract": "Cortical arealization arises during neurodevelopment from the confluence of molecular gradients representing patterned expression of morphogens and transcription factors. However, how these gradients relate to adult brain function, and whether they are maintained in the adult brain, remains unknown. Here we uncover three axes of topographic variation in gene expression in the adult human brain that specifically capture previously identified rostral-caudal, dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes of early developmental patterning. The interaction of these spatiomolecular gradients i) accurately predicts the location of unseen brain tissue samples, ii) delineates known functional territories, and iii) explains the topographical variation of diverse cortical features. The spatiomolecular gradients are distinct from canonical cortical functional hierarchies differentiating primary sensory cortex from association cortex, but radiate in parallel with the axes traversed by local field potentials along the cortex. We replicate all three molecular gradients in three independent human datasets as well as two non-human primate datasets, and find that each gradient shows a distinct developmental trajectory across the lifespan. The gradients are composed of several well known morphogens (e.g., PAX6 and SIX3), and a small set of genes shared across gradients are strongly enriched for multiple diseases. Together, these results provide insight into the developmental sculpting of functionally distinct brain regions, governed by three robust transcriptomic axes embedded within brain parenchyma.",

    "abstract": "Aging is the key risk factor for cognitive decline, yet the molecular changes underlying brain aging remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted spatiotemporal RNA-seq of the mouse brain, profiling 1,076 samples from 15 regions across 7 ages and 2 rejuvenation interventions. Our analysis identified a brain-wide gene signature of aging in glial cells, which exhibited spatially defined changes in magnitude. By integrating spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomics, we found that glia aging was particularly accelerated in white matter compared to cortical regions, while specialized neuronal populations showed region-specific expression changes. Rejuvenation interventions, including young plasma injection and dietary restriction, exhibited distinct effects on gene expression in specific brain regions. Furthermore, we discovered differential gene expression patterns associated with three human neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the importance of regional aging as a potential modulator of disease. Our findings identify molecular foci of brain aging, providing a foundation to target age-related cognitive decline.",
