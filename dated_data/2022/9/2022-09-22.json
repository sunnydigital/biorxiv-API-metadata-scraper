    "abstract": "Many human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), arise from mutations of stem and progenitor cells. Immunophenotypic profiling has shown that leukemia develops hierarchically, with mutations in leukemia stem cells associated with disease propagation and relapse1,2. Although leukemia initiating cells can be enriched using cell surface markers, their frequency tends to be variable and low, obscuring mechanisms and hindering effective therapies3,4. To define AML stem cells in human patients, we performed functional genomic profiling of diverse leukemias using label tracing techniques designed to preserve hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function in vivo. We found that propagation of human AML is mediated by a rare but distinct quiescent label-retaining cell (LRC) population that evades detection by currently known immunophenotypic markers. We show that human AML LRC quiescence is reversible, sparing genetic clonal competition that maintains its epigenetic inheritance. LRC quiescence is defined by distinct promoter-centered chromatin and gene expression dynamics, and controlled by a novel AP-1/ETS transcription factor network, which is associated with disease persistence and chemotherapy resistance in diverse patients. These results enable prospective isolation and functional genetic manipulation of immunophenotypically-varied leukemia stem cells in human patient specimens, as well as establish the key functions of epigenetic plasticity in leukemia development and therapy resistance. We anticipate that these findings will lead to the elucidation of essential properties of leukemia stem cell quiescence and the design of therapeutic strategies for their clinical identification and control.",

    "abstract": "The canonical glycolysis generates two molecules of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) from one glucose through eleven cascade biochemical reactions. Here, we designed and constructed a Minimal Artificial Glycolytic (MAG) pathway consisting of only three types of biochemical reactions, with phosphoketolase as the core, combined with phosphatase and isomerase as auxiliary enzymes. It could theoretically achieve a 100% carbon yield to acetyl-CoA from any monosaccharide by integrating one-carbon condensation reaction. We tested the MAG pathway in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the catabolism of typical C1-C6 carbohydrates to acetyl-CoA with yields from 82% to 95%. This novel glycolytic pathway provides a promising route for biomanufacturing with stoichiometric productivity from multiple carbon sources in the future.",

    "abstract": "Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) causes severe disease in cattle and water buffalo and is transmitted by hematophagous arthropod vectors. Detailed information of the adaptive and innate immune response to LSDV is limited, hampering the development of tools to control the disease. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the immune responses of calves experimentally inoculated with LSDV via either needle-inoculation or arthropod-inoculation using virus-positive Stomoxys calcitrans and Aedes aegypti vectors. Seven out of seventeen needle-inoculated calves (41%) developed clinical disease characterised by multifocal necrotic cutaneous nodules. In comparison 8/10 (80%) of the arthropod-inoculated calves developed clinical disease. A variable LSDV-specific IFN-{gamma} immune response was detected in the needle-inoculated calves from 5 days post inoculation (dpi) onwards, with no difference between clinical calves (developed cutaneous lesions) and nonclinical calves (did not develop cutaneous lesions). In contrast a robust and uniform cell-mediated immune response was detected in all eight clinical arthropod-inoculated calves, with little response detected in the two nonclinical arthropod-inoculated calves. Neutralising antibodies against LSDV were detected in all inoculated cattle from 5-7 dpi. Comparison of the production of anti-LSDV IgM and IgG antibodies revealed no difference between clinical and nonclinical needle-inoculated calves, however a strong IgM response was evident in the nonclinical arthropod-inoculated calves but absent in the clinical arthropod-inoculated calves. This suggests that early IgM production is a correlate of protection in LSD. This study presents the first evidence of differences in the immune response between clinical and nonclinical cattle and highlights the importance of using a relevant transmission model when studying LSD.",

    "abstract": "STING is an intracellular sensor of cyclic di-nucleotides involved in response to pathogen- or self-derived DNA that induces protective immunity, or if dysregulated, autoimmunity. STING trafficking is tightly linked to its activity. We aimed to systematically characterize genes regulating STING trafficking and to define their impact on STING responses. Based on proximity-ligation proteomics and genetic screens, an ESCRT complex containing HGS, VPS37A and UBAP1 was found to be required for STING degradation and signaling shutdown. Analogous to phosphorylated STING creating a platform for IRF3 recruitment, oligomerization-driven STING ubiquitination by UBE2N formed a platform for ESCRT recruitment at the endosome, responsible for STING signaling shutdown. A UBAP1 mutant that underlies human spastic paraplegia and disrupts ESCRT function led to STING-dependent type I IFN responses at the steady-state, defining ESCRT as a homeostatic regulator of STING signaling.",

    "abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, has the most segmented genome among known bacteria. In addition to a linear chromosome, the B. burgdorferi genome contains over 20 linear and circular endogenous plasmids. While many of these plasmids are dispensable under in vitro culture conditions, they are maintained during the natural life cycle of the pathogen. Plasmid-encoded functions are required for colonization of the tick vector, transmission to the vertebrate host, and evasion of host immune defenses. Different Borrelia strains can vary substantially in the type of plasmids they carry. The gene composition within the same type of plasmid can also differ from strain to strain, impeding the inference of plasmid function from one strain to another. To facilitate the investigation of the role of specific B. burgdorferi plasmids, we developed a Cas9-based approach that targets a plasmid for removal. As a proof-of-principle, we showed that targeting wild-type Cas9 to several loci on the endogenous plasmids lp25 or lp28-1 of the B. burgdorferi type strain B31 results in sgRNA-specific plasmid loss even when homologous sequences (i.e., potential sequence donors for DNA recombination) are present nearby. Cas9 nickase versions, Cas9D10A or Cas9H840A, also cause plasmid loss, though not as robustly. Thus, sgRNA-directed Cas9 DNA cleavage provides a highly efficient way to eliminate B. burgdorferi endogenous plasmids that are non-essential in axenic culture.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic marks such as histone acetylation and methylation play important roles in the biology and virulence of malaria parasites. Here I report that histone lactylation is also found in these parasites, and speculate on its potential functions. Lactylation is a new epigenetic modification, discovered only in 2019 in human cells. This nascent field has since focussed largely on human biology, but lactyl epigenetic marks could be particularly important in malaria parasites, which are exposed to high and fluctuating lactate levels in their host environment. This is because parasites in the bloodstream respire by glycolysis, producing lactate, and hyperlactataemia is characteristic of severe malarial disease. Therefore, blood lactate could be a signal for the status of the infected host, which could be directly translated to virulence responses via histone lactylation and modulation of parasite gene expression. Responses could include the rate of conversion into sexual transmission stages, the expression of cytoadherence genes - which enhance immune evasion by the parasite but can exacerbate pathology in the host - and the modulation of parasite stress-resistance. Lactylation may soon join acetylation and methylation as a key tool in the epigenetic arsenal of Plasmodium.",
