    "abstract": "Delirium is a common postoperative neurologic complication among older adults. Despite its prevalence of 14-50% and likely association with inflammation, the exact mechanisms underlying postoperative delirium are unclear. This project aimed at characterizing systemic and central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory changes following surgery in both mice and humans. Matched plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the \"Investigating Neuroinflammation Underlying Postoperative Brain Connectivity Changes, Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction, Delirium in Older Adults\" (INTUIT; NCT03273335) were used to parallel murine endpoints. Delirium-like behavior was evaluated in aged mice using the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Test (5-CSRTT). Using a well-established orthopedic surgical model in the FosTRAP reporter mouse, we detected neuronal changes in the prefrontal cortex, an area implicated in attention, but notably not in the hippocampus. In aged mice, plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels increased after orthopedic surgery, but hippocampal YKL-40 expression was decreased. Given the growing role of YKL-40 in delirium and other neurodegenerative conditions, we assayed human plasma and CSF samples. Plasma YKL-40 levels were also similarly increased after surgery, with a trend toward greater post-operative plasma YKL-40 increase in patients with delirium. In contrast to plasma, YKL-40 levels in CSF decreased following surgery, which paralleled the findings in the mouse brain. Finally, we confirmed changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) after surgery as early as 9 hours in mice, which warrants for more detailed and acute evaluations of BBB integrity following surgery in humans. All together, these results provide a nuanced understanding of the neuroimmune interactions underlying post-operative delirium in mice and humans, and highlight translational biomarkers to test potential cellular targets and mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Training spiking recurrent neural networks on neuronal recordings or behavioral tasks has become a popular way to study computations performed by the nervous system. As the size and complexity of neural recordings increase, there is a need for efficient algorithms that can train models in a short period of time using minimal resources. We present optimized CPU and GPU implementations of the recursive least-squares algorithm in spiking neural networks. The GPU implementation can train networks of one million neurons, with 100 million plastic synapses and a billion static synapses, about 1000 times faster than an unoptimized reference CPU implementation. We demonstrate the codes utility by training a network, in less than an hour, to reproduce the activity of > 66, 000 recorded neurons of a mouse performing a decision-making task. The fast implementation enables a more interactive in-silico study of the dynamics and connectivity underlying multi-area computations. It also admits the possibility to train models as in-vivo experiments are being conducted, thus closing the loop between modeling and experiments.",

    "abstract": "To make adaptive decisions, we build an internal model of associative relationships in the environment and use it to predict specific forthcoming outcomes. Detailed stimulus-outcome memories are a core feature of such cognitive maps, yet little is known of the neuronal systems that support their encoding. We used fiber photometry, cell-type and pathway-specific optogenetic manipulation, Pavlovian cue-reward conditioning, and a decision-making test in male and female rats, to reveal that ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTADA) projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) drive the encoding of stimulus-outcome memories. Dopamine is released in the BLA during stimulus-outcome pairing and VTADA[-&gt;]BLA activity is necessary and sufficient to link the identifying features of a reward to a predictive cue, but does not mediate general value or reinforcement. These data reveal a dopaminergic pathway for the learning that supports adaptive decision making and help understand how VTADA neurons achieve their emerging multifaceted role in learning.",

    "abstract": "The molecular underpinnings that govern the endoproteolytic release of the amyloid beta peptide (A{beta}) from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are now quite well understood. The same cannot be said for the events that precipitate the aggregation and amyloid deposition of A{beta} in Alzheimers disease (AD). The 14-amino-acid cyclic neuroendocrine peptide somatostatin (SST-14) has long been thought of as playing a role, foremost by controlling the expression of the A{beta} clearing enzyme neprilysin, and more recently by directly interacting with A{beta} oligomers. Missing have been in vivo data in a relevant A{beta} amyloidosis model. Here we addressed this shortcoming by crossing AppNL-F/NL-F mice with Sst-deficient mice of identical genetic background to assess if and how the presence of Sst influences key pathological hallmarks of A{beta} amyloidosis that develop in AppNL-F/NL-F mice after 10 months of age. Surprisingly, we found that Sst had no influence on whole brain neprilysin transcript, protein or activity levels, an observation that cannot be accounted for by a compensatory upregulation of the Sst paralog, cortistatin (Cort), that we observed in 15-month-old Sst-deficient mice. The absence of Sst did lead to a subtle but significant increase in the density of cortical A{beta} amyloid plaques. Follow-on western blot analyses of whole brain extracts indicated that Sst interferes with early steps of A{beta} assembly that manifest in Sst null brains through the appearance of SDS-stable smears of 55- 150 kDa. As expected, no effect of Sst on tau steady-state levels or its phosphorylation were observed. Results from this study are easier reconciled with an emerging body of data that point toward Sst affecting A{beta} amyloid plaque formation through direct interference with A{beta} aggregation rather than through its effects on neprilysin expression.",

    "abstract": "Insufficient sleep is a major health issue. Inadequate sleep is associated with an array of poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, certain forms of cancer, Alzheimers disease, depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Given concerns with typical sedative hypnotic drugs for treating sleep difficulties, there is a compelling need for added alternative interventions. Here, we report results of a non-invasive electrical brain stimulation approach to optimizing sleep involving transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).\n\nA total of 25 participants (mean age: 46.3, S.D. {+/-}12.4, 15 females) were recruited for a null-stimulation controlled (Control condition), within subjects, randomized crossed design, that included two variants of an active condition involving 15 minutes pre-sleep tACS stimulation. To evaluate the impact on sleep quality, the two active tACS stimulation conditions were designed to modulate sleep-dependent neural activity in the theta/alpha frequency bands, with both stimulation types applied to all subjects in separate sessions. The first tACS condition used a fixed stimulation pattern across all participants, a pattern composed of stimulation at 5Hz and 10Hz. The second tACS condition used a personalized stimulation approach with the stimulation frequencies determined by each individuals peak EEG frequencies in the 4-6Hz and 9-11Hz bands.\n\nPersonalized tACS stimulation increased sleep quantity (duration) by 22 minutes compared to a Control condition (p=.04), and 19 minutes compared to Fixed tACS stimulation (p=.03). Fixed stimulation did not significantly increase sleep duration compared to Control (mean: 3 minutes; p=0.75). For sleep onset, the Personalized tACS stimulation resulted in reducing the onset by 28% compared to the Fixed tACS stimulation (6 minutes faster, p=.02). For a Poor Sleep sub-group (n=13) categorized with Clinical Insomnia and with a high insomnia severity, Personalized tACS stimulation improved sleep duration by 33 minutes compared to Fixed stimulation (p=0.02), and 30 minutes compared to Control condition (p<0.1).\n\nTogether, these results suggest that Personalized stimulation improves sleep quantity and time taken to fall asleep relative to Control and Fixed stimulation providing motivation for larger-scale trials for Personalized tACS as a sleep therapeutic, including for those with insomnia.",

    "abstract": "The highly-conserved stomatin domain has been identified in genes throughout all classes of life. In animals, different stomatin domain-encoding genes have been implicated in the function of the kidney, red blood cells, and specific neuron types, though the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. In one well-studied example of stomatin domain gene function, the C. elegans gene mec-2 and its mouse homologue Stoml3 are required for the function of mechanosensory neurons, where they modulate the activity of mechanosensory ion channels on the plasma membrane. Here we identify an additional shared function for mec-2 and Stoml3 in a very different sensory context, that of olfaction. In worms, we find that a subset of stomatin domain genes are expressed in olfactory neurons, but only mec-2 is strongly required for olfactory behavior. mec-2 acts cell-autonomously and does not have any observable effect on olfactory neuron development or morphology, but modestly reduces olfactory neuron activity. We generate a Stoml3 knockout mouse and demonstrate that, like its worm homologue mec-2, it is required for olfactory behavior. In mice, Stoml3 is not required for odor detection, but is required for odor discrimination. Therefore, in addition to their shared roles in mechanosensory behavior, mec-2 and Stoml3 also have a shared role in olfactory behavior.",

    "abstract": "The olfactory neuroepithelium serves as a sensory organ for odors and is part of the nasal mucosal barrier. Olfactory sensory neurons are surrounded and supported by epithelial cells. A subset of these, microvillous cells (MVCs), are strategically positioned at the apical surface but their specific functions are still enigmatic and their relationship to the rest of the solitary chemosensory cell family is unclear. Here, we establish that the larger family of MVCs comprises tuft cells and ionocytes in both mice and humans. Olfactory TRPM5+ tuft-MVCs share a core transcriptional profile with the chemosensory tuft family, prominently including the machinery for lipid mediator generation. Integrating analysis of the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, we define the unique receptor expression of TRPM5+ tuft-MVC compared to the G[a]-gustducin+ respiratory tuft cells and characterize a new population of glandular DCLK1+ tuft cells. To establish how allergen sensing by tuft-MVCs might direct olfactory mucosal responses, we employed an integrated single-cell transcriptional and protein analysis. We defined a remodeling olfactory epithelial switch pathway with induction of Chil4 and a distinct pathway of proliferation of the quiescent olfactory horizontal basal stem cell (HBC), both triggered in the absence of significant olfactory apoptosis. While the Chil4 pathway was dependent on STAT6 signaling and innate lymphocytes, neither were required for HBC proliferation. HBC proliferation was dependent on tuft-MVCs, establishing these specialized epithelial cells as both sensors for allergens and regulators of olfactory stem cell responses. Together our data provide high resolution characterization of the nasal tuft cell heterogeneity and uncover a novel mechanism by which TRPM5+ tuft cells direct the olfactory mucosal response to allergens.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe identify the enigmatic TRPM5+ olfactory microvillous cells as tuft cells, and show their functional role as regulators of olfactory stem cell proliferation in response to environmental signals.",

Furthermore, rWnt5A administration appreciably blocks the progression of L. donovani infection established in a mouse model. This line of defense in vivo is associated with an elevation in immune cell associated ROS, and an activated T cell profile marked by increased IFN-{gamma} and Granzyme B expression. As a corollary, infection associated disruption of splenic white pulp organization is markedly restrained. In summary, this study unveils the therapeutic potential of rWnt5A in curbing L. donovani infection and the progression of experimental visceral leishmaniasis through immune cell signaling. Additionally, it opens up new avenues of investigation into the use of rWnt5A as a therapeutic agent for restraining progression of the drug resistant refractory disease.",

Not surprisingly, we observed impaired TH2 responses in Hp-infected Chi3l1-/- mice. However, we also found that T cell intrinsic expression of Chi3l1 was required for ICOS upregulation following activation of naive CD4 T cells and was necessary for the development of the IL-4+ TFH subset, which supports germinal center (GC) B cell reactions and IgE responses. The requirement for Chi3l1 in TFH and IgE responses was also seen following alum-adjuvanted vaccination. While Chi3l1 was critical for IgE humoral responses it was not required for vaccine or infection induced IgG1 responses.

    "abstract": "Generating spatial predictions of species distribution is a central task for research and policy. Currently, correlative species distribution models (cSDMs) are among the most widely used tools for this purpose. However, cSDMs fundamental assumption of species distributions in equilibrium with their environment is rarely met in real data and limits their applicability for dynamic projections. Process-based, dynamic SDMs (dSDMs) promise to overcome these limitations as they explicitly represent transient dynamics and enhance spatio-temporal transferability. Software tools for implementing dSDMs become increasingly available, yet their parameter estimation can be complex.\n\nHere, we test the feasibility of calibrating and validating a dSDM using long-term monitoring data of Swiss red kites (Milvus milvus). This population has shown strong increases in abundance and a progressive range expansion over the last decades, indicating a non-equilibrium situation. We construct an individual-based model with the RangeShiftR modelling platform and use Bayesian inference for model calibration. This allows the integration of heterogeneous data sources, such as parameter estimates from published literature as well as observational data from monitoring schemes, with coherent assessment of parameter uncertainty. Our monitoring data encompass counts of breeding pairs at 267 sites across Switzerland over 22 years. We validate our model using a spatial-block cross-validation scheme and assess predictive performance with a rank-correlation coefficient.\n\nOur model showed very good predictive accuracy of spatial projections and represented well the observed population dynamics over the last two decades. Results suggest that reproductive success was a key factor driving the observed range expansion. According to our model, the Swiss red kite population fills large parts of its current range but has potential for further increases in density.\n\nWe demonstrate the practicality of data integration and validation for dSDMs using RangeShifteR. This approach can improve predictive performance compared to cSDMs. The workflow presented here can be adopted for any population for which some prior knowledge on demographic and dispersal parameters as well as spatio-temporal observations of abundance or presence/absence are available. The fitted model provides improved quantitative insights into the ecology of a species, which may greatly help conservation and management actions.\n\nOpen Research statementThis submission uses novel code which is provided in an external repository.

    "abstract": "The traits of plants determine how they interact with each other and their environment, constituting key knowledge for diverse fields. The lack of comprehensive knowledge of plant traits (the \"Raunkiaerian shortfall\") poses a major, cross-disciplinary, barrier to scientific advancement. Spatial biases in trait coverage may also lead to erroneous conclusions affecting ecosystem management and conservation planning. Thus, there is an urgent need to assess the spatial completeness of plant trait data, understand drivers of geographic biases, and to identify solutions for filling regional gaps. Here, we leverage a comprehensive set of regional species checklists for vascular plants and trait data for 2,027 traits and 128,929 plant species from the TRY database to assess trait data completeness across the globe. We show that trait data availability in TRY is associated with socioeconomic and biological factors influencing sampling likelihood: trait completeness was positively associated with mean species range size, research expenditure, and human population density and negatively associated with endemism and vascular plant species richness. Integration of a second, regional trait database (AusTraits) more than doubled trait completeness for the continent covered, indicating that the creation and integration of regional databases can rapidly expand trait completeness.\n\nPlain Language SummaryThe traits of plants determine how they interact with each other and their environment. Our knowledge of plant traits is incomplete, limiting scientific advancement as well as our ability to manage ecosystems and plan conservation actions. We show that there are large biases in trait data availability which are associated with both biological factors (range size, endemism, species richness) and socioeconomic factors (research expenditure, human population density). We also show how regionally-focused efforts can help rapidly expand trait data availability.",

    "abstract": "The concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) have been lying at the core of the theory of sustainable harvesting a fishery for decades and have become a key reference point for many fishing administrations, including the European Union. However, the existence of a MSY relies on the stability of a population equilibrium. This hypothesis, though always true in the original Schaeffer model, is still challenging in more realistic and recent population models. However, recent advances shows that fish population can exhibit complex dynamics that are ill described by the classical theory. In particular, processes occurring at intra-annual time scales can affect the stability of a population equilibrium even in a strictly single species case. Associated to stability, the resilience of the equilibrium (defined as an inverse return-time following a perturbation) also matters in a management purpose. Here, we introduce an analytical single population model in discrete time with a monthly time-step allowing temporal distinction between maturation and recruitment with density-dependent mortality and fishing exploitation. We show that, thanks to an appropriate population structure, we can easily derive inter-annual population equilibrium, and study their resilience and stability properties. Then, we show that under classical hypothesis concerning density-dependence, equilibrium stability is not guaranteed and that MSY can, in theory, be associated to unstable or low resilient states. However such destabilisation seems unlikely with realistic sets of parameters. Finally, a numerical illustration for sole (Solea solea) of the Bay of Biscay suggests that the value of MSY was sensitive to maturation period whereas viability, stability and resilience was more sensitive to timing of recruitment. The value of FMSY appeared robust to uncertainty concerning maturation and recruitment. We conclude by saying that even if the risk of destabilisation is low for real populations, the risk of decreased resilience near the border of extinction should be cared of.",

    "abstract": "The Euteliidae stand apart in the Noctuoidea as the second smallest family, but most highly specialized in terms of larval hostplant relationships, favouring plant families with high levels of resin or latex, including the family dominant in Oriental lowland forests, the Dipterocarpaceae. Given the proportionally large foliage biomass represented by dipterocarps, exploitation of this abundant resource by lepidopteran defoliators is surprisingly low, and the Euteliidae may have achieved this through pre-adaption to dipterocarp chemical defences. Therefore, to assess this, we performed a molecular phylogenetic analysis on the family Euteliidae to clarify deep divergences and elucidate evolutionary relationships at the level of the subfamily, tribe, and genus. Our dataset consists of 6.3 kbp of one mitochondrial and seven nuclear DNA loci and was analyzed using model-based phylogenetic methods, i.e., maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. We attempted to diagnose apomorphic morphological character states for Euteliidae and each monophyletic group within the family. Additionally, the evolution of hostplant use was reconstructed and a molecular-dating approach was conducted to assess the ages of major lineages within Euteliidae. We present an updated phylogenetic hypothesis for Euteliidae consisting of two strongly supported subfamilies: Euteliinae and Stictopterinae. Within Stictopterinae there are two tribes: Stictopterini and Odontodini. Several genera (e.g., Targalla, Paectes, Marathyssa, Eutelia) were found to be polyphyletic and require taxonomic revision. Two new genera (Niklastelia and Pellinentelia) are described and several taxonomic changes (e.g., new combinations and new synonymies) are made. The Neotropical genus Thyriodes, currently included in Euteliidae, is found to be associated with Erebinae (Erebidae). The divergence time estimate for the split between the Euteliidae and Noctuidae is at 53 my, and the Euteliidae split into the subfamilies Euteliinae and Stictopterinae at 42 my. In Stictopterinae, the tribes Stictopterini and Odontodini split at 31 my and the Euteliinae began a much more complex diversification at 34 my. Ancestral hostplant reconstruction identified Malpighiales (e.g., Clusiaceae) as the ancestral larval hostplant order for the family Euteliidae. The ancestors of Stictopterinae also appear to have been Malpighiales feeders, but then split into exclusive specialisms on Malvales (Odontodini) and Malpighiales (Stictopterini) hostplants. Larvae of Stictopterini appear to be restricted to Clusiaceae, apart from a few records from Dipterocarpaceae. In Euteliinae, Anacardiaceae are predominant as larval hosts. Thus, all hosts in the family are lactiferous, possibly providing some degree of pre-adaptation for exploiting Dipterocarpaceae.",

    "abstract": "A substitution represents the emergence and fixation of an allele in a population or species and is the fundamental event from which phylogenetic models of sequence evolution are devised. Because of the increasing availability of genomic sequences, we are now able to take advantage of intraspecific variability when reconstructing the tree of life. As a result, substitutions can be more realistically modeled as the product of mutation, selection, and genetic drift. However, it is still unclear whether this increased complexity affects our measures of evolutionary times and rates. This study seeks to answer this question by contrasting the traditional substitution model with a population genetic equivalent using data from 4385 individuals distributed across 179 populations and representing 17 species of animals, plants, and fungi. We found that when the population genetics dynamic is modeled via the substitution rates, the evolutionary times and rates of the two models are well correlated, suggesting that the phylogenetic model is able to capture the time and pace of its population counterpart. However, a closer inspection of this result showed that the traditional models largely ignore the effect of the effective population size, even when it is explicitly accounted for in the substitution rates. Our findings suggest that superimposing population-genetics results on the substitution rates is an effective strategy to study mutation and selection biases, while other data sources (e.g., life history traits or polymorphisms) may need to be additionally integrated to make the traditional substitution models sensitive to the impact of genetic drift. When combined with the known effect of ancestral population size on generating phylogenomic incongruence due to incomplete lineage sorting, our findings provide further evidence that unaccounted-for variations in the effective population size may be one of the primary causes of errors in phylogenetic analyses at shorter time scales.",

    "abstract": "The patterns of speciation in marine fishes are largely unknown, in part due to the deficiency of species-level phylogenies and information on species distributions, and partly due to conflicting relationships between species dispersal, range size, and patterns of co- occurrence. Most research on global patterns of marine fish speciation has focused on coral reef or pelagic species. Carangoidei is a clade of marine fishes including the trevallies, remoras, and dolphinfishes that utilize both coral reef and pelagic environments, spanning the ecologies of coral reef obligate and open-ocean species. We used sequence capture of 1314 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from 154 taxa to generate a phylogeny of Carangoidei and its parent clade, Carangiformes. Age-range correlation analyses of the geographic distributions and divergence times of sister species pairs reveal widespread sympatry, with 73% of sister species pairs exhibiting a sympatric geographic distribution, regardless of node age, and most species pairs co-existing across large portions of their ranges. We also observe greater disparity in body size and water column depth utilization between sympatric than allopatric sister species. These and other ecological or behavioral attributes likely facilitate sympatry among the most closely related carangoid species, which exhibit sympatry at a larger taxonomic scale than has previously been described in marine fishes.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThis study integrates phylogeography with distributional analysis to understand the demographic history and range dynamics of a limited dispersal capacity amphibian species, Blue-spotted Salamander (Ambystoma laterale), under several climate change scenarios. For this we used an ecological niche modeling approach, together with Bayesian based demographic analysis, to develop inferences regarding this species demographic history and range dynamics. The current model output was mostly congruent with the present distribution of the Blue-spotted Salamander. However, under both the Last Interglacial and the Last Glacial Maximum bioclimatic conditions, the model predicted a substantially narrower distribution than the present. These predictions showed almost no suitable area in the current distribution range of the species during almost the last 22.000 y before present (ybp). The predictions indicated that the distribution of this species shifted from eastern coast of northern North America to the southern part of the current distribution range of the species. The Bayesian Skyline Plot analysis, which provided good resolution of the effective population size changes over the Blue-spotted Salamander history, was mostly congruent with ecological niche modeling predictions for this species. This study provides the first investigation of the Blue-spotted Salamanders late-Quaternary history based on ecological niche modeling and Bayesian-based demographic analysis. In terms of the main result of this study, we found that the species present genetic structure has been substantially affected by past climate changes, and this species has reached current distribution range almost from nothing since the Last Glacial Maximum.",

    "abstract": "Populations of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea (EHPNG, area 11,157 km2) lived in relative isolation from the rest of the world until the mid-20th century, and the region contains a wealth of linguistic and cultural diversity. Notably, several populations of EHPNG were devastated by an epidemic prion disease, kuru, which at its peak in the mid-twentieth century led to some villages being almost depleted of adult women. Until now, population genetic analyses to learn about genetic diversity, migration, admixture and the impact of the kuru epidemic have been restricted to a small number of variants or samples. Here, we present a population genetic analysis of the region based on genome-wide genotype data of 943 individuals from 21 linguistic groups and 68 villages in EHPNG, including 34 villages in the South Fore linguistic group, which the group most affected by kuru. We find a striking degree of genetic population structure in the relatively small region (average FST between linguistic groups 0.024; area similar to Jamaica). The genetic population structure correlates well with linguistic grouping, with some noticeable exceptions. Also, we find evidence of a series of discrete admixture events that appear to coincide with previously expected introduction dates and movement of the sweet potato in the region. Finally, we find signatures of more recent migration within the EHPNG region and observe a substantial excess of female migration into the heavily kuru-affected South Fore linguistic group (p=0.0017, Chi Squared Test), likely reflecting the sex-bias in incidence of kuru. These data provide an in-depth look at the population genetics of a region devastated by a prion disease epidemic and which was until recently relatively isolated from the rest of the world.",

Considering only self-domestication and neural-crest-function annotations in the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) model, our partitioned heritability analysis revealed statistically significant enrichments across all disorders investigated. The estimates of the heritability enrichments for self-domestication loci were similar across neurodevelopmental disorders, ranging from 0.902 (EAS SCZ, p=4.55x10-20) to 1.577 (TS, p=5.85x10-5). Conversely, a wider spectrum of heritability enrichment estimates was present for neural crest function with the highest enrichment observed for TS (enrichment=3.453, p=2.88x10-3) and the lowest for EAS SCZ (enrichment=1.971, p=3.8lx10-3). Although these estimates appear to be strong, the enrichments for self-domestication and neural crest function were null once we included additional annotations related to different genomic features.

However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using Drosophila as a model, we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of Uex, the homologous gene of magnesium transporters of the Cyclin M family (CNNM) causes increased daily total sleep. Ectopic-expression of CNNM1 can rescue the sleep phenotype in Uex knockdown flies. UEX exhibits rhythmic oscillations in the brain and affects the efflux of cellular Mg2+. Knockdown of Uex in the nervous system influences Ca2+-mediated CREB signaling and neuroplasticity. Additionally, Uex physically interacts with CNK, the upstream regulator of ERK pathway. Similar effects on sleep are observed with knockdown of Cnk in flies. We propose that the UEX regulates sleep through its downstream Ca2+-dependent CREB signaling and a CNK-ERK pathway.

    "abstract": "We use ATAC-seq to examine chromatin accessibility for four different tissues in Drosophila melanogaster: adult female brain, ovaries, and both wing and eye-antennal imaginal discs from males. Each tissue is assayed in eight different inbred strain genetic backgrounds, seven associated with a reference quality genome assembly. We develop a method for the quantile normalization of ATAC-seq fragments and test for differences in coverage among genotypes, tissues, and their interaction at 44099 peaks throughout the euchromatic genome. For the strains with reference quality genome assemblies, we correct ATAC-seq profiles for read mis-mapping due to nearby polymorphic structural variants (SVs). Comparing coverage among genotypes without accounting for SVs results in a highly elevated rate (55%) of identifying false positive differences in chromatin state between genotypes. After SV correction, we identify 1050, 30383, and 4508 regions whose peak heights are polymorphic among genotypes, among tissues, or exhibit genotype-by-tissue interactions, respectively. Finally, we identify 3988 candidate causative variants that explain at least 80% of the variance in chromatin state at nearby ATAC-seq peaks.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYChromatin states are well described in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, but adult and pre-adult tissues are poorly studied, as are differences among genotypes. We carried out ATAC-seq on four different tissues in eight different inbred genotypes with biological replicates within tissue and genotype. We discover that apparent differences in coverage, and by inference chromatin openness, are often due to segregating structural variants (SVs) that can only be corrected for if strains are associated with high-quality genome assemblies. After correction for false positives associated with SVs, we identify thousands of regions that appear to vary in chromatin state between genotypes or vary between genotypes in a tissue-dependent manner. It has been widely speculated that cis-regulatory variants contribute to standing variation in complex traits. If this is true, chromatin states that vary between individuals, perhaps in a tissue-dependent manner, are likely to be enriched for quantitative trait loci.",

    "abstract": "As the collapse of the Western Roman Empire accelerated during the 4th and 5th centuries, arriving \"barbarian\" groups began to establish new communities in the border provinces of the declining (and eventually former) empire. This was a time of significant cultural and political change throughout not only these border regions but Europe as a whole.1,2 To better understand post-Roman community formation in one of these key frontier zones after the collapse of the Hunnic movement, we generated new paleogenomic data for a set of 38 burials from a time series of three 5th century cemeteries3-5 at Lake Balaton, Hungary. We utilized a comprehensive sampling approach to characterize these cemeteries along with data from 38 additional burials from a previously published mid-6th century site6 and analyzed them alongside data from over 550 penecontemporaneous individuals7-19. The range of genetic diversity in all four of these local burial communities is extensive and wider ranging than penecontemporaneous Europeans sequenced to date. Despite many commonalities in burial representation and demography, we find that there were substantial differences in genetic ancestry between the sites. We detect evidence of northern European gene flow into the Lake Balaton region. Additionally, we observe a statistically significant association between dress artefacts and genetic ancestry among 5th century genetically female burials. Our analysis shows that the formation of early Medieval communities was a multifarious process even at a local level, consisting of genetically heterogeneous groups.",

    "abstract": "Diverse inbred mouse strains are among the foremost models for biomedical research, yet genome characterization of many strains has been fundamentally lacking in comparison to human genomics research. In particular, the discovery and cataloging of structural variants is incomplete, limiting the discovery of potentially causative alleles for phenotypic variation across individuals. Here, we utilized long-read sequencing to resolve genome-wide structural variants (SVs, variants [&ge;] 50 bp) in 20 genetically distinct inbred mice. We report 413,758 site-specific SVs that affect 13% (356 Mbp) of the current mouse reference assembly, including 510 previously unannotated variants which alter coding sequences. We find that 39% of SVs are attributed to transposable element (TE) variation accounting for 75% of bases altered by SV. We then utilized this callset to investigate the impact of TE heterogeneity on mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and find multiple TE classes that influence chromatin accessibility across loci. We also identify strain-specific transcription start sites originating in polymorphic TEs that modify gene expression. Our work provides the first long-read based analysis of mouse SVs and illustrates that previously unresolved TEs underlie epigenetic and transcriptome differences in mESCs.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an agriculturally and economically important staple crop that has immense potential as a bioenergy feedstock due to its relatively high productivity on marginal lands. To capitalize on and further improve sorghum as a potential source of sustainable biofuel, it is essential to understand the genomic mechanisms underlying complex traits related to yield, composition, and environmental adaptations. Expanding on a recently developed mapping population, we generated de novo genome assemblies for 10 parental genotypes from this population and identified a comprehensive set of over 24 thousand large structural variants (SVs) and over 10.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).These resources can be integrated into both ongoing and future mapping and trait discovery for sorghum and its myriad uses including food, feed, bioenergy, and increasingly as a carbon dioxide removal mechanism. We show that SVs and nonsynonymous SNPs are enriched in different gene categories, emphasizing the need for long read sequencing in crop species to identify novel variation. Furthermore, we highlight SVs and SNPs occurring in genes and pathways with known associations to critical bioenergy-related phenotypes and characterize the landscape of genetic differences between sweet and cellulosic genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Bone is the primary metastasis site for lethal prostate cancer, often resulting in poor prognosis, crippling pain, and diminished functioning that drastically reduce both quality of life and survivability. Uniquely, prostate cancer bone metastasis induces aberrant bone overgrowth, due to an increase of osteoblasts induced by tumor-secreted bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Conjugating drugs to substances that target the tumor-induced bone area within the metastatic tumor foci would be a promising strategy for drug delivery. To develop such a strategy, we conjugated a near infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, the dye Cy5.5, to serve as a surrogate for drugs, with alendronate, which targets bone. Characterization, such as infrared spectroscopy, confirmed the synthesis of the Cy5.5-ALN conjugate. The maximum absorbance of free Cy5.5, which was at 675 nm, did not change upon conjugation. Alendronate targeted the bone component hydroxyapatite in a dose-dependent manner up to 2.5 M, with a maximum of 85% of Cy5.5-ALN bound to hydroxyapatite, while free Cy5.5 alone had 6% binding. In in vitro cell binding studies, Cy5.5-ALN bound specifically with mineralized bone matrix of differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells or 2H11 endothelial cells that were induced to become osteoblasts through endothelial-to-osteoblast transition, the underlying mechanism of prostate-cancer-induced bone formation. Neither Cy5.5-ALN nor free Cy5.5 bound to undifferentiated MC3T3-E1 or 2H11 cells. Bone-targeting efficiency studies in non-tumor-bearing mice revealed accumulation over time in the spine, jaw, knees, and paws injected with Cy5.5-ALN, and quantification showed higher accumulation in femurs than in muscle at up to 28 days, while the free Cy5.5 dye was observed circulating without preferential accumulation and decreased over time. There was a linear relationship with fluorescence when the injected concentration of Cy5.5-ALN was between 0.313 and 1.25 nmol/27 g of mouse, as quantified in mouse femurs both in vivo and ex vivo. Ex vivo evaluation of bone-targeting efficiency in nude mice was 3 times higher for bone-forming C4-2b-BMP4 tumors compared to non-bone-forming C4-2b tumors (p-value < 0.001). Fluorescence microscopy imaging of the tumors showed that Cy5.5-ALN co-localized with the bone matrix surrounding tumor-induced bone, but not with the viable tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that a drug-ALN conjugate is a promising approach for targeted delivery of drug to the tumor-induced bone area in the metastatic foci of prostate cancer.",

Yet, targeted metabolomic analysis using [U-13C]malate also revealed concomitant succinate dehydrogenase reversal during anoxia yielding succinate by reducing fumarate, albeit to a small extent.

Implantation of a bioelectronic device typically initiates a foreign body response, which can limit long-term recording and stimulation efficacy. Techniques from regenerative medicine have shown a high propensity for promoting integration of implants with surrounding tissue, but these implants lack the capabilities for the sophisticated recording and actuation afforded by electronics. Combining these two fields can achieve the best of both worlds. Here, we show the construction of a hybrid implant system for creating long-term interfaces with tissue. We create implants by combining a microelectrode array with a bioresorbable and remodellable gel. These implants are shown to produce a minimal foreign body response when placed into musculature, allowing us to record long-term electromyographic signals with high spatial resolution. This device platform drives the possibility for a new generation of implantable electronics for long-term interfacing.",

    "abstract": "The potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell differentiated cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is greatly limited by their functional immaturity. Strong relationships exist between CM structure and function, leading many in the field to seek ways to mature hiPSC-CMs by culturing on biomimetic substrates, specifically those that promote alignment. However, these in vitro models have so far failed to replicate the alignment that occurs during cardiac differentiation. We show that engineered alignment, incorporated before and during cardiac differentiation, affects hiPSC-CM electrochemical coupling and mitochondrial morphology. We successfully engineer alignment in differentiating hiPSCs as early as Day 4. We uniquely apply optical redox imaging to monitor the metabolic changes occurring during cardiac differentiation. We couple this modality with cardiac-specific markers, which allows us to assess cardiac metabolism in heterogeneous cell populations. The engineered alignment drives hiPSC-CM differentiation towards the ventricular compact CM subtype and improves electrochemical coupling in the short term. Moreover, we observe glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation switch throughout differentiation and CM development. On the subcellular scale, we note changes in mitochondrial morphology in the long term. Our results demonstrate that cellular alignment accelerates hiPSC-CM maturity and emphasizes the interrelation of structure and function in cardiac development. We anticipate that combining engineered alignment with additional maturation strategies will result in improved development of mature CMs from hiPSC and strongly improve cardiac tissue engineering.\n\nImpact StatementThis work demonstrates the mixed effect of engineered structure in inducing matured function of human induced pluripotent stem cell -derived cardiomyocytes. Isolating the impacts of hiPSC-CM alignment on functionality is a necessary step in optimizing the culture conditions to develop cardiac cell therapies. Furthermore, our work has broader implications concerning how we understand the impact of mechanical microenvironments on stem cell differentiation and development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe clinical characterization of the functional status of active wounds remains a considerable challenge that at present, requires excision of a tissue biopsy. In this pilot study, we use a convolutional Siamese neural network architecture to predict the functional state of a wound using digital photographs of wounds in a canine model of volumetric muscle loss (VML).\n\nMaterials and MethodsImages of volumetric muscle loss injuries and tissue biopsies were obtained in a canine model of VML. Gene expression profiles for each image were obtained using RNAseq. These profiles were then converted to functional profiles using a manual review of validated gene ontology databases. A Siamese neural network was trained to regress functional profile expression values as a function of the data contained in an extracted image segment showing the surface of a small tissue biopsy. Network performance was assessed in a test set of images using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).\n\nResultsThe network was able to predict the functional expression of a range of functions based with a MAPE ranging from [~]5% to [~]50%, with functions that are most closely associated with the early-state of wound healing to be those best-predicted.\n\nConclusionsThese initial results suggest promise for further research regarding this novel use of ML regression on medical images. The regression of functional profiles, as opposed to specific genes, both addresses the challenge of genetic redundancy and gives a deeper insight into the mechanistic configuration of a region of tissue in wounds. As this preliminary study focuses on the first 14 days of wound healing, future work will focus on extending the training data to include longer time periods which would result in additional functions, such as tissue remodeling, having a larger presence in the training data.",

    "abstract": "Human pancreatic -amylase (HPA), which works as a catalyst for carbohydrate hydrolysis, is one of the viable targets to control type 2 diabetes. The inhibition of -amylase lowers blood glucose levels and helps to alleviate hyperglycemia complications. Herein, we systematically screened the potential HPA inhibitors from an in-house library of natural products by molecular modeling. The modeling encompasses molecular docking, MM/GBSA binding energy calculations, MD simulations, and ADMET analysis. This research identified newboulaside B, newboulaside A, quercetin-3-O-{beta}-glucoside, and sasastilboside A as the top four potential HPA inhibitors from the library of natural products, whose Glide docking scores and MM/GBSA binding energies range from -9.191 to -11.366 kcal/mol and -19.38 to -50.29 kcal/mol, respectively. Based on the simulation, among them, newboulaside B was found as the best HPA inhibitor. Throughout the simulation, with the deviation of 3[A] (acarbose = 3[A]), it interacted with ASP356, ASP300, ASP197, THR163, ARG161, ASP147, ALA106, and GLN63 via hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the comprehensive ADMET analysis revealed that it has good pharmacokinetic properties having not acutely toxic, moderately bioavailable, and non-inhibitor nature toward cytochrome P450. All the results suggest that newboulaside B might be a promising candidate for drug discovery against type 2 diabetes.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

The updated version uses likelihood to generate probability distributions of ancestral states at internal nodes of the phylogeny.

    "abstract": "Splicing modulation is a promising treatment strategy pursued to date only in splicing-factor mutant cancers; however, its therapeutic potential is poorly understood outside of this context. Like splicing factors, genes encoding components of the cohesin complex are frequently mutated in cancer, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where they are associated with poor outcomes. Here, we show that cohesin mutations are biomarkers of sensitivity to drugs targeting the splicing-factor SF3B1 (H3B-8800 and E-7107). We identify drug-induced alterations in splicing and corresponding reduced gene expression of a large number of DNA repair genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, as the mechanism underlying this sensitivity in cell line models, primary patient samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of AML. We find that DNA damage repair genes are particularly sensitive to exon skipping induced by SF3B1 modulators given their long length and large number of exons per transcript. Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment of cohesin-mutant cells with SF3B1 modulators not only results in impaired DNA damage response and accumulation of DNA damage, but it significantly sensitizes cells to subsequent killing by PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy, and leads to improved overall survival of PDX models of cohesin-mutant AML in vivo. Our findings expand the potential therapeutic benefits of SF3B1 splicing modulators to include cohesin-mutant MDS and AML, and we propose this as a broader strategy for therapeutic targeting of other DNA damage-repair deficient cancers.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe identify an unexpected effect of SF3B1 splicing inhibitors on regulation of DNA damage repair genes and show efficacy of combination treatment in cohesin-mutant MDS and AML.",

    "abstract": "Paleobiologists often employ network-based methods to analyze the inherently complex data retrieved from geohistorical records. Because they lack a common framework for designing, performing, evaluating, and communicating network-based studies, reproducibility and interdisciplinary research are hampered. The high-dimensional and spatiotemporally resolved data also raise questions about the limitations of standard network models. They risk obscuring paleontological patterns by washing out higher-order node interactions when assuming independent pairwise links. Recently introduced higher-order representations and models better suited for the complex relational structure of geohistorical data provide an opportunity to move paleobiology research beyond these challenges. Higher-order models can represent the spatiotemporal constraints on the information paths underlying geohistorical data, capturing the high-dimensional patterns more accurately. Here we describe how to use the Map Equation framework for designing higher-order models of geohistorical data, address some practical decisions involved in modeling complex dependencies, and discuss critical methodological and conceptual issues that make it difficult to compare results across studies in the growing body of network paleobiology research. We illustrate multilayer networks, hypergraphs, and varying Markov time models for higher-order networks in case studies on gradient analysis, bioregionalization, and macroevolution, and delineate future research directions for current challenges in the emerging field of network paleobiology.",

    "abstract": "Advancing novel immunotherapy strategies requires refined tools in preclinical research to thoroughly assess drug targets, biodistribution, safety, and efficacy. Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) offers unprecedented fast volumetric ex vivo imaging of large tissue samples in high resolution. Yet, to date laborious and unstandardized tissue processing procedures have limited throughput and broader applications in immunological research. Therefore, we have developed a simple and harmonized protocol for processing, clearing and imaging of all mouse organs and even entire mouse bodies. Applying this Rapid Optical Clearing Kit for Enhanced Tissue Scanning (ROCKETS) in combination with LSFM allowed us to comprehensively study the in vivo biodistribution of an antibody targeting Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) in 3D. Quantitative high-resolution scans of whole organs did not only reveal known EpCAM expression patterns but, importantly, uncovered several new EpCAM-binding sites. We identified choroid plexi in the brain and duodenal papillae as unexpected locations of high EpCAM-expression. These tissue locations may be considered as particularly sensitive sites due their importance for liquor production or as critical junctions draining bile and digestive pancreatic enzymes into the small bowel, respectively. These newly gained insights appear highly relevant for clinical translation of EpCAM-addressing immunotherapies. Thus, ROCKETS in combination with LSFM may help to set new standards for preclinical evaluation of immunotherapeutic strategies. Conclusively, we propose ROCKETS as an ideal platform for a broader application of LSFM in immunological research optimally suited for quantitative co-localization studies of immunotherapeutic drugs and defined cell populations in the microanatomical context of organs or even whole mice.",

    "abstract": "Clinically, fetal growth restriction (FGR) is only detectable in later gestation, despite pathophysiological establishment likely earlier in pregnancy. Additionally, there are no effective in utero treatment options for FGR. We have developed a nanoparticle to deliver human insulin-like 1 growth factor (hIGF-1) in a trophoblast-specific manner which results in increased expression of hIGF-1. IGF-1 signaling in the placenta regulates multiple developmental processes including trophoblast invasion and maternal vascular remodeling, both of which can be diminished in the FGR placenta. We aimed to determine the effects of short-term hIGF-1 nanoparticle treatment on sub-placenta/decidua trophoblast signaling mechanisms in FGR and under normal growth conditions. Using the guinea pig maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) model of FGR, ultrasound-guided, intra-placenta injections of hIGF-1 nanoparticle were performed at gestational day 30-33, and dams sacrificed five days later. Sub-placenta/decidua tissue was separated from placenta for further analyses. Western blot was used to analyze protein expression of ERK/AKT/mTOR signaling proteins (phospho-Erk (pErk), phospho-Akt (pAkt), raptor, rictor and deptor). qPCR was used to analyze gene expression of vascular/remodeling factors (vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf), placenta growth factor (Pgf), platelet-derived growth factor (Pdgf)) and tight junction/adhesion proteins (claudin 5 (Cldn5), p-glycoprotein (Abcb1), occludin (Ocln) and tight junction protein 1 (Zo1)). MNR reduced expression of pErk, PdgfB and Cldn5, and increased expression of Ocln and Zo1 in the sub-placenta/decidua. In MNR + hIGF1 nanoparticle sub-placenta/decidua, expression of PdgfB, Ocln and Zo1 was normalized, whilst pAkt, VegfB, Vegf receptor 1 and PdgfB receptor were increased compared to MNR. In contrast, hIGF-1 nanoparticle treatment of normal placentas reduced expression of pErk, raptor and increased expression of the mTOR inhibitor deptor. This was associated with reduced expression of VegfA, Plgf, and PdgfB. Here we have shown that the impact of hIGF-1 nanoparticle treatment is dependent on pregnancy environment. Under MNR/FGR, hIGF-1 nanoparticle treatment triggers increased expression of growth factors and normalization of EMT factors. However, under normal conditions, the response of the placenta is to decrease AKT/mTOR signaling and growth factor expression to achieve homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a highly structured and differentiated tissue responsible for voluntary movement and metabolic regulation. Muscles however, are heterogeneous and depending on their location, speed of contraction, fatiguability and function, can be broadly subdivided into fast and slow twitch as well as subspecialized muscles, with each group expressing common as well as specific proteins. Congenital myopathies are a group of non-inflammatory non-dystrophic muscle diseases caused by mutations in a number of genes, leading to a weak muscle phenotype. In most cases specific muscles types are affected, with preferential involvement of fast twitch muscles as well as extraocular and facial muscles. Here we performed relative and absolute quantitative proteomic analysis of EDL, soleus and extraocular muscles from wild type and transgenic mice carrying compound heterozygous mutations in Ryr1 identified in a patient with a severe congenital myopathy. Our quantitative proteomic study shows that recessive Ryr1 mutations not only decrease the content of RyR1 protein in muscle, but also impact the content of many other proteins; in addition, we provide important insight into the pathological mechanism of congenital myopathies linked to mutations in other genes encoding components of the excitation contraction coupling molecular complex.",

    "abstract": "The renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) plays a critical role in diabetic nephropathy, and inhibitors of the RAS are central components in its therapy. Renin circulates in the blood in its active form but also in the form of its enzymatically inactive precursor prorenin. In humans, the plasma prorenin concentration exceeds that of active renin several times. While the plasma concentration of active renin is unchanged or even reduced in diabetic patients, the prorenin concentration increases significantly and it has been shown that high prorenin levels are associated with diabetic microvascular damage. Why prorenin increases in diabetes while active renin is reduced is unclear. Previous studies suggest that there may be formation of prorenin in the tubular system of diabetic kidneys. To investigate the functional consequences of possible tubular renin formation in diabetes, we generated mice with inducible tubule-specific deletion of the renin gene (tubule-renin KO).\n\nUnder control conditions, tubule-renin KO had no apparent phenotype and plasma and tissue levels of renin and prorenin were similar to those of mice with intact tubular renin (control mice). In control mice type-1 diabetes (streptozotocin, STZ) for 8 to 12 weeks stimulated tubular renin mRNA and protein expression, especially in distal nephron segments including collecting ducts. This increase in renin synthesis in renal tubules was markedly attenuated or even absent in tubule-renin KO mice. Similar to diabetic patients, plasma prorenin was markedly elevated in diabetic control mice. This stimulation of plasma prorenin was absent in mice with tubule-specific deletion of the renin gene. Moreover, the high prorenin levels in renal tissue, which were observed in diabetic control mice, were markedly reduced in tubule-renin KO. Noteworthy, plasma renin activity was not reduced in tubule-renin KO compared with controls, suggesting that renal tubules of diabetic mice mainly release prorenin. Kidneys of control mice with intact tubular renin showed classical signs of diabetic renal damage, such as albuminuria, mesangial expansion, fibrosis, inflammation and capillary rarefaction. All of these parameters were significantly ameliorated in tubule-renin KO, indicating that tubular renin, most likely in its prorenin form, significantly aggravates renal damage in diabetes.\n\nThese data provide clear evidence for the first time that the tubular renin system is an additional source for circulating prorenin in diabetes, hereby providing an explanation for the paradox regulation of active renin and prorenin in diabetes. Moreover, the data show that tubular renin markedly contributes to the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with increased risk of developing Non-Communicable Diseases. We have a placenta-specific nanoparticle gene therapy protocol that increases placental expression of human insulin-like growth factor 1 (hIGF-1), for the treatment of FGR in utero. We aimed to characterize the effects of FGR on hepatic gluconeogenesis pathways during early stages of FGR establishment, and determine whether treatment of the placenta with nanoparticle mediated hIGF-1 therapy could resolve differences in the FGR fetus. Female Hartley guinea pigs (dams) were fed either a control or maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) diet using established protocols. At GD30-33, dams underwent ultrasound guided, transcutaneous, intra-placental injection of hIGF-1 nanoparticle or PBS (sham), and were sacrificed 5 days post-injection. Fetal liver tissue was fixed and snap frozen for morphology and gene expression analysis. In female and male fetuses, liver weight as a percentage of body weight was reduced by MNR, and not changed with hIGF-1 nanoparticle treatment. In female fetal livers, expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (Hif1) and tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) were increased in MNR compared to Control, but reduced towards Control in MNR + hIGF-1 livers. In male fetal liver, MNR increased expression of Igf-1, and decreased expression of Igf-2 compared to Control. Igf-1 and Igf-2 expression was restored to Control levels in the MNR + hIGF-1 group. This data provides further insight into the sex-specific mechanistic adaptations seen in FGR fetuses, and demonstrates that disruption to fetal developmental mechanisms may be returned to normal by treatment of the placenta.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial spot caused by Xanthomonas euvesicatoria is a major disease of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) in warm and humid production environments. Use of genetically resistant cultivars is an effective approach to manage bacterial spot. Two recessive resistance genes, bs5 and bs6, confer non-race-specific resistance against bacterial spot. The objective of our study was to map these two loci in the pepper genome. We used a genotyping-by-sequencing approach to initially map the position of the two resistances. Segregant populations for bs5 and bs6 were developed by crossing susceptible Early CalWonder (ECW) with near-isogenic lines ECW50R (bs5 introgression) or ECW60R (bs6 introgression). Following fine-mapping, bs5 was delimited to a ~535 Kbp interval on chromosome 3, and bs6 to a ~666 Kbp interval in chromosome 6 of pepper. We also identified 14 and 8 candidate resistance genes for bs5 and bs6, respectively, based on predicted protein coding polymorphisms between ECW and the corresponding resistant parent. Mapping of bs5 and bs6 will facilitate their use in breeding programs through marker-assisted selection and is also a crucial step towards understanding the mechanisms of resistance.\n\nKey messageTwo recessive bacterial spot resistance genes were mapped in the pepper genome, which will facilitate their advancement in commercial pepper for management of all races of Xanthomonas euvesicatoria.",

    "abstract": "Peptide asparaginyl ligases (PALs) are Asn/Asp(Asx)-specific ligases that are useful for precision modifications of proteins and live-cell surfaces. However, PALs share high structural similarity to the far more common asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs), also known as legumains that hydrolyze peptide bonds after Asx, thus making it challenging to identify PALs in a sea of AEPs. Previously we identified sequences flanking the catalytic site as ligase activity determinants (LADs) for legumains. Here we show that two conserved substrate-binding Gly residues are critical, but negative determinants for ligase activity, based on a combined bioinformatics analysis of 1,500 plant legumains, mutagenesis and functional study of 16 novel legumains, plus identification of seven new PALs. We also show that PALs are rare and AEPs are much more common, accounting for about 1% and 88%, respectively. Our results suggest that specific glycine residues are molecular determinants to identify PALs and AEPs as two different legumain subfamilies.",

There is a lack of validated measures that capture user experience to inform of the technology utility. We aimed to establish a consensus of items and domains that different simulation experts would include in a measure for immersive technology use.\n\nMethodsA 3-stage modified Delphi using online software was conducted to support the conceptual framework for the proposed measure. The first round was informed by prior work on immersive technology in simulation. In the first round, participants were asked to describe what we could measure in simulation-based education and technology. Thematic analysis generated key themes that were presented to the participants in the second round. Ranking of importance in round 2 was determined by mean rank scores. The final round was an online meeting for final consensus discussion and most important domains by experts were considered.\n\nResultsA total of 16 simulation experts participated in the study. A consensus was reached on the ideal measure in immersive technology simulation that would be a user questionnaire and domains of interest would be: what was learnt, the degree of immersion experienced, fidelity provided, debrief, psychological safety and patient safety. No consensus was reached with the barriers that this technology introduces in education.\n\nConclusionsThere is varied opinion on what we should prioritise in measuring the experience in simulation practice. Importantly, this study identified key areas that aids our understanding on how we can measure new technology in educational settings. Synthesising these results in to a multidomain instrument requires a systematic approach to testing in future research",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental works have implicated astrocytes as a significant cell type underlying several neuronal processes in the mammalian brain, from encoding sensory information to neurological disorders. Despite this progress, it is still unclear how astrocytes are communicating with and driving their neuronal neighbors. While previous computational modeling works have helped propose mechanisms responsible for driving these interactions, they have primarily focused on interactions at the synaptic level, with microscale models of calcium dynamics and neurotransmitter diffusion. Since it is computationally infeasible to include the intricate microscale details in a network-scale model, little computational work has been done to understand how astrocytes may be influencing spiking patterns and synchronization of large networks. We overcome this issue by first developing an \"effective\" astrocyte that can be easily implemented to already established network frameworks. We do this by showing that the astrocyte proximity to a synapse makes synaptic transmission faster, weaker, and less reliable. Thus, our \"effective\" astrocytes can be incorporated by considering heterogeneous synaptic time constants, which are parametrized only by the degree of astrocytic proximity at that synapse. We then apply our framework to large networks of exponential integrate-and-fire neurons with various spatial structures. Depending on key parameters, such as the number of synapses ensheathed and the strength of this ensheathment, we show that astrocytes can push the network to a synchronous state and exhibit spatially correlated patterns.\n\nAuthor summaryIn many areas of the brain, glial cells called astrocytes wrap their processes around synapses - the points of contact between neurons. The number of wrapped synapses and the tightness of wrapping varies between brain areas and changes during some diseases, such as epilepsy. We investigate the effect that this synaptic ensheathment has on communication between neurons and the resulting collective dynamics of the neuronal network. We present a general, computationally-efficient way to include astrocytes in neuronal networks using an \"effective astrocyte\" representation derived from detailed microscopic scale models. The resulting hybrid networks allow us to emulate and observe the effect of ensheathment conditions corresponding to different brain areas and disease states. In particular, we find that it makes the networks more likely to switch into a highly correlated regime, contrary to predictions from the traditional neurons-only view. These results open a new perspective on neural network dynamics, where our understanding of conditions for generating correlated brain activity (e.g., rhythms associated with various brain functions, epileptic seizures) needs to be reevaluated.",

    "abstract": "The adult brain demonstrates remarkable multisensory plasticity by dynamically recalibrating information from multiple sensory sources. When a systematic visual-vestibular heading offset is experienced, the unisensory perceptual estimates recalibrate toward each other (in opposite directions) to reduce the conflict. The neural substrate of this recalibration is unknown. Here, we recorded single-neuron activity from the dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd), parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), and ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas in three male rhesus macaques during visual-vestibular recalibration. Both visual and vestibular tuning in MSTd recalibrated-each according to their respective cues perceptual shifts. Vestibular tuning in PIVC also recalibrated together with corresponding perceptual shifts (cells were not visually tuned). By contrast, VIP neurons demonstrated a unique phenomenon: both vestibular and visual tuning recalibrated according to vestibular perceptual shifts. Such that, visual tuning shifted, surprisingly, contrary to visual perceptual shifts. Therefore, while unsupervised recalibration (to reduce cue conflict) occurs in early multisensory cortices, higher-level VIP reflects only a global shift, in vestibular space.\n\nIn BriefThe neural bases of multisensory plasticity are currently unknown. Here, Zeng et al. studied neuronal recalibration to a systematic visual-vestibular cue conflict. In multisensory cortical areas MSTd and PIVC, single-unit responses to visual and vestibular stimuli recalibrated to reduce the cue conflict, along with their respective unisensory perceptual shifts. By contrast, in higher-level VIP, both visual and vestibular neuronal responses recalibrated with vestibular perceptual shifts. This led to a surprising recalibration of visual responses opposite in direction to visual perceptual shifts. This exposes differential aspects of multisensory plasticity across multisensory cortical areas, and reveals a novel hybrid of visual responses within a vestibular reference frame in parietal neurons.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIn the presence of a systematic heading conflict, visual and vestibular cues recalibrate towards one another to reduce the conflict.\nC_LIO_LIIn MSTd, neuronal responses to vestibular and visual cues recalibrated, each according to their respective cues perceptual shifts.\nC_LIO_LIIn PIVC, vestibular responses recalibrated according to vestibular perceptual shifts (cells were not visually tuned).\nC_LIO_LIIn VIP, neuronal responses to both vestibular and visual cues recalibrated together with vestibular perceptual shifts (opposite in direction to visual perceptual shifts).\nC_LIO_LIProfound differences in neuronal recalibration expose different functions across multisensory cortical areas.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Animals of the same species often exhibit similar behaviours that are advantageously adapted to their body and their environment. These behaviours are shaped by selection pressures over evolutionary timescales at the species level, yet each individual produces these behaviours using a different, uniquely constructed brain. It remains unclear how these common behavioural adaptations emerge from the idiosyncratic neural circuitry of a given individual. Here, we hypothesised that the adaptive behaviour of a species requires specific neural population  latent dynamics. These latent dynamics should thus be preserved and identifiable across individuals within a species, regardless of the idiosyncratic aspects of each individuals brain. Using recordings of neural populations from monkey and mouse motor cortex, we show that individuals from the same species share surprisingly similar neural dynamics when they perform the same behaviour. The similarity in neural population dynamics extends beyond cortical regions to the dorsal striatum, an evolutionarily older structure, and also holds when animals con-sciously plan future movements without overt behaviour. These preserved dynamics are behaviourally-relevant, allowing decoding of intended and ongoing movements across individuals. We posit that these emergent neural population dynamics result from evolutionarily-imposed constraints on brain development, and reflect a fundamental property of the neural basis of behaviour.",

    "abstract": "When we internally generate mental images, we need to combine multiple features into a whole. Direct evidence for such feature integration during visual imagery is still lacking. Moreover, cognitive control mechanisms, including memory and attention, exert top-down influences on the perceptual system during mental images generation. However, it is unclear whether such top-down processing is content-specific or not. Feature integration and top-down processing involve short-range connectivity within visual areas, and long-range connectivity between control and visual areas, respectively. Here, we used a minimally constrained experimental paradigm wherein imagery categories were prompted using visual word cues only, and we decoded face versus place imagery based on their underlying connectivity patterns. Our results show that face and place imagery can be decoded from both short-range and long-range connections. These findings suggest that feature integration does not require an external stimulus but occurs also for purely internally generated images. Furthermore, control and visual areas exchange information specifically tailored to imagery content.\n\nTeaserDecoding visual imagery from brain connectivity reveals a content-specific interconnected neural code for internal image generation.",

    "abstract": "Dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex is thought to contribute to adaptive behavior by integrating temporally dispersed, behaviorally-relevant factors. Past work has revealed a variety of neural representations preceding actions, which are involved in internal processes like planning, working memory and covert attention. Task-related activity following actions has often been reported, but so far lacks a clear interpretation. We leveraged modified versions of classic oculomotor paradigms and population recordings to show that post-saccadic activity is a dominant signal in dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex that is distinct from pre-saccadic activity. Unlike pre-saccadic activity, post-saccadic activity occurs after each saccade, although its strength and duration are modulated by task context and expected rewards. In contrast to representations preceding actions, which appear to be mixed randomly across neurons, post-saccadic activity results in representations that are highly structured at the single-neuron and population level. Overall, the properties of post-saccadic activity are consistent with those of an action memory, an internal process with a possible role in learning and updating spatial representations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundElectroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method that records the brain signals with time resolution in the millisecond range, thereby allowing the monitoring of subjects mental states in real time. Using appropriate biomarkers extracted from these EEG signals and presenting them back in a neurofeedback loop can foster neural compensation mechanisms by teaching subjects to modulate their brain activity. Over the last decades, several neural biomarkers of aging have been described, with growing evidence suggesting that neuromodulation may have an important role in regulating brain activity in the elderly.\n\nMethods and objectivesWe used three neural biomarkers of aging, namely the Peak Alpha Frequency, the Gamma-band synchronization, and the Theta/Beta ratio, in the framework of an EEG-based brain-computer interface, with two main objectives: 1) to test whether healthy elderly people with subjective memory complaints may learn to modulate their brain activity through EEG-neurofeedback training in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study; and 2) whether that neuromodulation may have a positive impact on subjects cognition.\n\nResultsA significant self-modulation of two neural biomarkers that usually decline with age was observed exclusively in the group of subjects who underwent the EEG-neurofeedback training, in clear contrast with the subjects who received the sham feedback. This neuromodulation did not have a direct effect on subjects cognitive abilities, as measured by neuropsychological tests pre-versus post-training, probably because all the subjects accurately performed these tests already at study entry (i.e., pre-training).\n\nConclusionThe results of this double-blind study are in line with one of the main criteria for successful neuromodulation, thus encouraging research on EEG-neurofeedback as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for promoting self-regulation of brain activity with a view to improve cognitive aging.",

There are currently no effective treatments to halt pathogenesis and progression, which includes accumulation of misfolded proteins, neuroinflammation, and cognitive/behavioral deficits followed by irreversible neuronal death. We hypothesized that downregulation of two key neuroinflammatory targets would be neuroprotective. To test this, we utilized Nanoligomers in a prion-diseased mouse to assess the impact on glial inflammation, behavioral/cognition deficits, and loss of neurons. Nanoligomer treated mice displayed decreased numbers of glia, and improved behavior and cognitive tests. Critically, the Nanoligomer protected the brain from prion-induced spongiotic change, neuronal loss, and significantly increased life span, indicating that Nanoligomer inhibition of inflammatory pathways can prevent neuronal death and slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryImmunotherapeutic Nanoligomer in prion diseased mice opens new treatment avenues for other neurodegenerative diseases.",

This feature of thalamocortical wiring is thought to create columnar, ON/OFF domains in V1. We have recently shown that mice also have ON/OFF cortical domains, but the organization of their thalamic afferents remains unknown. Here we measured the visual responses of thalamocortical boutons using two-photon imaging and found they also cluster in space according to ON/OFF responses. Moreover, fluctuations in the relative density of ON/OFF boutons mirrors fluctuations in the relative density of ON/OFF receptive field positions on the visual field. These findings indicate that there is a segregation of ON/OFF signals already present in the thalamic input, a result that may reflect the spatial organization of retinal ganglion cell mosaics themselves.\n\nNew and NoteworthyNeurons in primary visual cortex cluster into ON and OFF domains, which have shown to be linked to the organization of receptive fields and cortical maps.

    "abstract": "The cornerstone of the reverse chemical ecology approach is the identification of odorant receptors (OR) sensitive to compounds in a large panel of odorants. In this approach, we de-orphanize ORs and, subsequently, measure behaviors elicited by these semiochemicals. After that, we evaluate behaviorally active compounds for applications in insect vector management. Intriguingly, multiple ORs encoded by genes highly expressed in mosquito antennae do not respond to any test odorant. One such case is CquiOR125 from the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say. To better understand CquiOR125s role in Culex mosquito olfaction, we have cloned a CquiOR125 orthologue in the genome of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (L.), AaegOR11. Unlike the unresponsive nature of the orthologue in Cx. quinquefasciatus, oocytes co-expressing AaegOR11 and AaegOrco elicited robust responses when challenged with fenchone, 2,3-dimethylphenol, 3,4-dimethylphenol, 4-methycyclohexanol, and acetophenone. AlphaFold models showed that AaegOR11 and CquiOR125 share structural homolog cores with MhraOR5, the only insect OR structure (PDB: 7LID) elucidated to date. Interestingly, AaegOR11 responded strongly and equally to (+)- and (-)-fenchone, with no chiral discrimination. Contrary to reports in the literature, fenchone did not show any repellency activity against Ae. aegypti or Cx. quinquefasciatus. Laboratory and field tests did not show significant increases in egg captures in cups filled with fenchone solutions compared to control cups. The second most potent ligand, 2,3-dimethylphenol, showed repellency activity stronger than that elicited by DEET at the same dose. We, therefore, concluded that AaegOR11 is a mosquito repellent sensor. It is feasible that CquiOR125 responds to repellents that remain elusive.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism traits emerge between the ages of 1 and 2. It is not known if experiences which increase the likelihood of childhood autism are related to early trait emergence, or if other exposures are more important. Identifying factors linked to toddler autism traits in the general population may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying atypical neurodevelopment.\n\nMethodsClinical, socio-demographic, and parental information was collected at birth from 536 toddlers in London, UK (gestational age at birth, sex, maternal body mass index, age, parental education level, parental first language, parental history of neurodevelopmental disorders) and at 18 months (parent cohabiting status, two measures of social deprivation, three measures of maternal parenting style, and a measure of maternal postnatal depression). General neurodevelopment was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (BSID-III), and autism traits were assessed using the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT). Multivariable models were used to identify associations between variables and Q-CHAT. A model including BSID-III was used to identify factors associated with Q-CHAT independent of general neurodevelopment. Models were also evaluated addressing variable collinearity with principal component analysis (PCA).\n\nResultsA multivariable model explained 20% of Q-CHAT variance, with four individually significant variables (two measures of parenting style and two measures of socio-economic deprivation). After adding general neurodevelopment into the model 36% of Q-CHAT variance was explained, with three individually significant variables (two measures of parenting style and one measure of language development). After addressing variable collinearity with PCA, parenting style and social deprivation were positively correlated with Q-CHAT score via a single principal component, independently of general neurodevelopment. Neither sex nor family history of autism were associated with Q-CHAT score.\n\nLimitationsThe Q-CHAT is parent rated and is therefore a subjective opinion rather than a clinical assessment. We measured Q-CHAT at a single timepoint, and to date no participant has been followed up in later childhood, so we are focused purely on emerging traits rather than clinical autism diagnoses.\n\nConclusionsAutism traits are common at age 18 months, and greater emergence is specifically related to exposure to early life adversity.",

We present the development and characterization of prefusion-stabilized, trimeric GPCs of LASV lineages II, V, and VI, revealing structural conservation despite sequence diversity. High-resolution structures and biophysical characterization of GPC in complex with GP1-A antibodies reveal their neutralization mechanisms. Finally, we present the isolation and characterization of a novel trimer-preferring neutralizing antibody belonging to the GPC-B competition group with an epitope that spans adjacent protomers and includes the fusion peptide.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBrazil is home to a multitude of venomous snakes, perhaps the most medically relevant of which belong to the Bothrops genus. Bothrops spp. are responsible for roughly 70% of all snakebites in Brazil, and envenomings caused by their bites can be treated with three types of antivenom: bothropic antivenom, bothro-lachetic antivenom, and bothro-crotalic antivenom. The choice in antivenom that is administered depends not only on its availability and how certain the treating physician is that the patient was bitten by a bothropic snake. The diagnosis of a bothropic envenoming can be made based on expert identification of a photo of the snake or based on a syndromic approach wherein the clinician examines the patient for characteristic manifestations of envenoming. This approach can be very effective but requires staff that has been trained in clinical snakebite management, which, unfortunately, far from all relevant staff has.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we describe a prototype of the first lateral flow assay (LFA) capable of detecting venoms from Brazilian Bothrops spp. The monoclonal antibodies for the assay were generated using hybridoma technology and screened in sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to identify Bothrops spp. specific antibody sandwich pairs. The sandwich pairs were used to develop a prototype LFA that was able to detect venom from several different Bothrops spp. The limit of detection (LoD) of the prototype was evaluated using Brazilian B. atrox whole venom and was determined to be 8.0 ng/mL in spiked serum samples and 9.5 ng/mL in spiked urine samples, when using a portable reader, and < 25 ng/mL in spiked buffer when reading by eye.\n\nSignificanceThe work presented here serves as a proof of concept of a genus-specific venom detection kit, which could support physicians in diagnosing Bothrops envenomings. Although further optimization and testing is needed before the LFA can find clinical use, such a device could aid in decentralizing antivenoms in the Brazilian Amazon and help ensure optimal snakebite management for even more victims of this highly neglected disease.",

    "abstract": "Accurate segregation of chromosomes is required to maintain genome integrity during cell division. This feat is accomplished by the microtubule-based spindle. To build a spindle rapidly and with high fidelity, cells take advantage of branching microtubule nucleation, which exponentially amplifies microtubules during cell division. Branching microtubule nucleation relies on the hetero-octameric augmin complex, but understanding how augmin promotes branching has been hindered by a lack of structural information about the complex. Here, we report an integrated model of vertebrate augmin, combining cryo-electron microscopy, advanced protein structural prediction, and the visualization of fused bulky tags via negative stain electron microscopy. This strategy allowed us to identify the location and orientation of each subunit within the structure. Evolutionary analysis of augmins structure reveals that it is highly conserved across diverse eukaryotes, and that augmin contains a previously-unidentified microtubule binding site. Moreover, we identify homology with the kinetochore-localized NDC80 complex. This new model of the augmin complex provides insight towards the mechanism and evolution of branching microtubule nucleation.",

However, these predictive methods assume species have stable niches across time and space. Furthermore, ignoring the time of occurrence data can obscure important information about species reproduction and ultimately fitness. In this study, we generate full-year and monthly ecological niche models for Capsella bursa-pastoris to see if we can detect changes in the seasonal niche of the species after long-distance dispersal. We find full-year ecological niche models have low transferability across continents and there are continental differences in the climate conditions that influence the distribution of C. bursa-pastoris. Monthly models have greater predictive accuracy than full-year models in cooler seasons, but the inability of any model to predict summer occurrence in North America suggests a change in the seasonal niche from the native range to the non-native range. These results highlight the utility of ecological niche models at finer temporal scales in predicting species distributions and unmasking subtle patterns of evolution.",

    "abstract": "Oceanic islands are cradles for diversity. Differences in predation pressures and lack of competition on islands are thought to drive both phenotypic and species diversification. While most work exploring these patterns has focused on life history, behavioral and morphological traits, many island species are uniquely colorful. Yet, a recent study of island bird coloration found that insular species are duller than continental species. Whether such shifts in color are associated with increased rates of color evolution on islands remains unknown. Here, we incorporate geometric morphometric techniques to study plumage color diversity in a speciose clade of colorful birds that inhabit nearly all areas of the globe--kingfishers (Aves: Alcedinidae). In particular, we test two hypotheses: (i) that plumage complexity enhances interspecific rates of color evolution and (ii) that plumage color diversity is elevated on islands. Our results show that more complex plumages result in more diverse colors among species and plumage color evolves faster on islands. Importantly, we found that insular species did not have more complex plumages than their continental relatives. Thus, complexity may be a key innovation that facilitates response to divergent (or relaxed) selection pressures on islands. Lack of support for competition driving rates of evolution along different color axes hints at an allopatric model of color evolution in which species adapt to local conditions on different islands. This work demonstrates how a truly multivariate treatment of color data can reveal evolutionary patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.",

    "abstract": "GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS1; OMIM #606777) is a rare genetic metabolic disease, characterized by infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, progressive microcephaly and movement disorders (e.g. spasticity and dystonia). It is caused by heterozygous mutations in the SLC2A1 gene, which encodes the GLUT1 protein, a glucose transporter across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Most commonly these variants arise de novo resulting in sporadic cases, although several familial cases with AD inheritance pattern have been described.\n\nTwenty-seven Italian pediatric patients clinically suspect of GLUT1DS from both sporadic and familial cases have been enrolled.\n\nWe detected by trios sequencing analysis 25 different variants causing GLUT1DS. Of these, 40% of the identified variants (10 out of 25) had never been reported before, including missense, frameshift and splice site variants. Their X-ray structure analyses strongly suggested the potential pathogenic effects of these novel disease-related mutations, broadening the genotypic spectrum heterogeneity found in the SLC2A1 gene. Moreover, 24% is located in a vulnerable region of the GLUT1 protein that involves transmembrane 4 and 5 helices encoded by exon 4, confirming a mutational hotspot in the SLC2A1 gene. Lastly, we investigated possible correlations between mutation type and clinical and biochemical data observed in our GLUT1DS cohort, revealing that splice site and frameshift variants are related to a more severe phenotype and low CSF parameters.\n\nAuthor summaryWe investigated the molecular data of 27 pediatric patients clinically suspect of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. By performing trios sequencing analysis, we highlighted ten novel disease-related variants, and their X-ray structure analyses, suggesting the pathogenic effects of these identified mutations. Moreover, the wide clinical and genetic heterogeneity observed in our cohort allowed possible correlations between mutation type and clinical and biochemical data. This analysis enabled to delineate that splice site and frameshift variants are related to a more severe phenotype and low CSF/glucose values. Further clinical and genetic/epigenetics studies could clearly the high phenotypic variability observed in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Highly efficient generation of deletions, substitutions, and small insertions (up to [~]150 bp) into the C. elegans genome by CRISPR/Cas9 has been facilitated by use of single-stranded oligonucleotide donors as repair templates. However, efficient insertion of larger sequences such as fluorescent markers and other functional proteins remains inefficient due to lack of standardized methods for generating repair templates and labor intensive or cost prohibitive synthesis. We have optimized the simple and efficient generation of long single-stranded DNA for use as donors in CRISPR/Cas9 using a standard PCR followed by an enzymatic digest by lambda exonuclease. Comparison of long single-stranded DNA donors to previously described methods using double-stranded DNA yields orders of magnitude increased efficiency for single-stranded DNA donors. This efficiency can be leveraged to simultaneously generate multiple large insertions as well as successful edits without use of selection or co-conversion (coCRISPR) markers when necessary. Our approach complements the CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit for C. elegans to enable highly efficient insertion of longer sequences with a simple, standardized and labor-minimal protocol.",

    "abstract": "Early organismal development consists of transformative events that lay the foundation for body formation and long-term phenotype. Despite this understanding, the rapid progression of events and the limited material available are major barriers to studying the earliest stages. The size and accessibility of Drosophila embryos overcome some of these limitations, and several studies characterizing early transcriptional events have been reported. Unfortunately, manual embryo staging, and elaborate protocols make the techniques employed in these studies prone to human and technical errors and incompatible with routine laboratory use. Herein, we present a straight-forward and operationally simple methodology for studying the early transcription ([&le;]3 hours) in Drosophila. This method relies on single-embryo RNA-sequencing and transcriptome ordering along a developmental trajectory (pseudo-time), thereby avoiding the need for the staging of the embryos. The obtained high-resolution and time-sensitive mRNA expression profiles uncovered the exact onset of transcription and degradation of transcripts and revealed an earlier transcription start for several zygotic genes. In addition, degradation patterns suggest that maternal mRNA decay is independent of mRNA levels. By classifying each embryo as male or female, we were also able to study sex-biased transcription between the beginning of zygotic transcription to gastrulation and identified 120 differentially expressed mRNAs. Using sex-specific transcription signatures, embryos can be sexed directly, eliminating the need for Y-chromosome genotyping. Herein, we report an accessible, single-embryo sequencing approach for high-resolution, time-sensitive transcriptome analysis. Our data provide an unparalleled resolution of gene expression during early development and enhance the current understanding of early transcriptional processes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of rejuvenation is central to aging research. No study has compared the effects of the four major rejuvenation strategies: senolytics, caloric restriction, in vivo partial cellular reprogramming and young/old blood factor exchange, which operate via different modalities. We use mice transcriptional data to compare them to each other and to normal aging. We find a shared gene expression program common to all rejuvenation strategies, in which inflammation declines and metabolism, especially of fatty acids, increases. An inverse signature occurs in normal aging. To test whether inflammation is upstream of the metabolic signature, we studied chronic inflammation in three different organs in young mice. Chronic inflammation was associated with a similar decline in metabolism, suggesting that inflammation is upstream of the metabolic signature. We find that inflammation may also underlie human transcriptional age calculator. We conclude that a core mechanism of rejuvenation acts through reduction of inflammation with downstream effects that enhance metabolism, attenuating the most robust age-related changes. This supports a notion of directly targeting genes associated with these pathways to mitigate age-related deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Local and global inference methods have been developed to infer structural contacts from multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins. They rely on correlations in amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Because homologous proteins share a common ancestry, their sequences also feature phylogenetic correlations, which can impair contact inference. We investigate this effect by generating controlled synthetic data from a minimal model where the importance of contacts and of phylogeny can be tuned. We demonstrate that global inference methods, specifically Potts models, are more resilient to phylogenetic correlations than local methods, based on covariance or mutual information. This holds whether or not phylogenetic corrections are used, and may explain the success of global methods. We analyse the roles of selection strength and of phylogenetic relatedness. We show that sites that mutate early in the phylogeny yield false positive contacts. We consider natural data and realistic synthetic data, and our findings generalise to these cases. Our results highlight the impact of phylogeny on contact prediction from protein sequences and illustrate the interplay between the rich structure of biological data and inference.",

For best possible predictions it is required that the clinical relevance of in vitro data is understood (in vitro-in vivo relationships) and that uncertainties have been investigated and considered.\n\nMethodsThe aim was to investigate in vitro-in vivo relationships for CLint, Papp vs fa and S vs fdiss and interlaboratory variability for fu, describe the clinical significance and uncertainties at certain levels of in vitro CLint, fu, Papp and S, and (based on the findings) develop a general in vitro-in vivo translation guide.\n\nResults and ConclusionIt was possible to finf data for describing how in vivo CLint, fa and fdiss distribute and varies at different levels of in vitro CLint, Papp and S and how fu varies between laboratories and methods at different fu-levels. It is apparent that there are considerable interlaboratory variabilities for CLint, fu and Papp: corresponding to up to 2500-, 700- and 35-fold variability for CLint, fu and fa, respectively. Apparently, S is a poor predictor of fdiss. Proposed S-thresholds do not seem clinically useful (overestimated). It does not seem appropriate to define in vitro CLint of 0.5-2 {micro}L/min/106 cells as good metabolic stability (rather moderate to moderately high). Results shown for CLint, Papp and fu are applicable as general guidelines when internal standard values for reference compounds are unavailable.",

    "abstract": "The harvest time is a key factor for cigar leaves with high quality, which varies greatly depending on the environment. Here, we performed a genome-scale mRNA transcriptomic analysis on the cigar cultivar CX-26 (Nicotiana tabacum L.) to evaluate the relationship between gene expression and growth state. The leaves were harvested with 67 (T1), 71(T2) and 75 (T3)-day growth. A total of 80,502 genes were detected in the CX-26 leaves, of which 64,611 genes were annotated on the reference genome. Principal component analysis showed that T1 and T2 leaves had a high overlapping pattern, while T3 leaves were distinct. Indeed, T1 and T2 leaves had fewer differential expressing genes (DEGs), while T3 leaves had 26,456 DGEs from T2 leaves, supporting the distinct growth of T3 leaves. GO annotations mainly enriched the photosynthesis-related metabolic process, catalytic activity and binding biological processes. KEEG analysis identified the key pathways including photosynthesisantenna proteins, plant hormone/MAPK signaling pathway and plant-pathogen interaction. The maturity regulation and defense response-associated hormones abscisic acid and jasmonate acid were higher in the T3 leaves than that in T1 and T2 leaves confirming the KEEG analysis. Furthermore, several photosynthesis-related enzymes and a transcription factor were highlighted in the gene regulatory network, which might regulate the dynamics of carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and energy metabolism. In summary, our study provides insight into the growth state of CX-26 cigar leaves.",

    "abstract": "Drought tolerance is a highly complex trait controlled by numerous interconnected pathways with substantial variation within and across plant species. This complexity makes it difficult to distill individual genetic loci underlying tolerance, and to identify core or conserved drought responsive pathways. Here, we collected drought physiology and gene expression datasets across diverse genotypes of the C4 cereals sorghum and maize and searched for signatures defining water deficit responses. Differential gene expression identified few overlapping drought associated genes across sorghum genotypes, but using a predictive modeling approach, we found a shared core drought response across development, genotype, and stress severity. Our model had similar robustness when applied to datasets in maize, reflecting a conserved drought response between sorghum and maize. The top predictors are enriched in functions associated with various abiotic stress responsive pathways as well as core cellular functions. These conserved drought response genes were less likely to contain deleterious mutations than other gene sets, suggesting that core drought responsive genes are under evolutionary and functional constraints. Our findings support a broad evolutionary conservation of drought responses in C4 grasses regardless of innate stress tolerance, which could have important implications for developing climate resilient cereals.\n\nSignificance StatementDrought is a complex and variable stress that is difficult to quantify and link to underlying mechanisms both within and across species. Here, we developed a predictive model to classify drought stress responses in sorghum and identify important features that are responsive to water deficit. Our model has high predictive accuracy across development, genotype, and stress severity, and the top features are enriched in genes related to classical stress responses and have functional and evolutionary conservation. We applied this sorghum trained model to maize, and observed similar predictive accuracy of drought responses, supporting transfer learning across plant species. Our findings suggest there are deeply conserved drought responses across C4 grasses that are unrelated to tolerance.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSEAccumulating evidence from recent studies has indicated the importance of studying the interaction between the microvascular and lymphatic systems in the brain. To date, most imaging methods can only measure blood or lymphatic vessels separately, such as dynamic-susceptibility-contrast (DSC) MRI for blood vessels and DSC MRI in the CSF (cDSC MRI) for lymphatic vessels. An approach that can measure both blood and lymphatic vessels in a single scan will offer the advantages such as halved scan time and contrast dosage. Based on previous works on DSC and cDSC MRI, this study proposes an MRI approach for concurrent measurement of perfusion parameters related to small blood and lymphatic vessels in the brain within one single scan.\n\nMETHODSBloch simulations were performed to optimize a dual-echo sequence for the measurement of gadolinium(Gd)-induced blood and CSF signal changes using a short and a long echo time, respectively. MRI experiments were performed in healthy subjects to evaluate the dual-echo approach by comparing it with existing separate methods.\n\nRESULTSThe proposed method showed consistent results in human brains as previous studies using separate methods. Signal changes from small blood vessels occurred faster than lymphatic vessels after intravenous Gd-injection.\n\nCONCLUSIONGd-induced signal changes in blood and CSF can be detected simultaneously in healthy subjects with the proposed sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first study in which the temporal difference in Gd-induced signal changes from small blood and lymphatic vessels after intravenous Gd-injection was measured in the same human subjects.",

    "abstract": "Humans can read and comprehend text rapidly, implying that readers might process multiple words per fixation. However, the extent to which parafoveal words are previewed and integrated into the evolving sentence context remains disputed. We investigated parafoveal processing during natural reading by recording brain activity and eye movements using MEG and an eye tracker while participants silently read one-line sentences. The sentences contained an unpredictable target word that was either congruent or incongruent with the sentence context. To measure parafoveal processing, we flickered the target words at 60 Hz and measured the resulting brain responses (i.e., Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging, RIFT) during fixations on the pre-target words. Our results revealed a significantly weaker tagging response for target words that were incongruent with the sentence context compared to congruent ones, even within 100 ms of fixating the word immediately preceding the target. This reduction in the RIFT response was also found to be predictive of individual reading speed. We conclude that semantic information is not only extracted from the parafovea but can also be integrated with the sentence context before the word is fixated. This early and extensive parafoveal processing supports the rapid word processing required for natural reading. Our study suggests that theoretical frameworks of natural reading should incorporate the concept of deep parafoveal processing.",

    "abstract": "The formation of neural circuits requires extensive interactions of cell-surface proteins to guide axons to their correct target neurons. Trans-cellular interactions of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) with its partner teneurin-3 instruct the precise assembly of hippocampal networks by reciprocal repulsion. Lphn2 acts as a receptor in distal CA1 neurons to direct their axons to proximal subiculum, and as a repulsive ligand in proximal subiculum to direct proximal CA1 axons to distal subiculum. It remains unclear if Lphn2-mediated intracellular signaling is required for its role in either context. Here, we show that Lphn2 couples to G12/13 in heterologous cells, which is increased by constitutive exposure of the tethered agonist. Specific mutations of Lphn2s tethered agonist region disrupt its G protein coupling and autoproteolytic cleavage, whereas mutating the autoproteolytic cleavage site prevents cleavage but preserves a functional tethered agonist. Using an in vivo misexpression assay, we demonstrate that wild-type Lphn2 misdirects proximal CA1 axons to proximal subiculum and that Lphn2 tethered agonist activity is required for its role as a repulsive receptor. By contrast, neither tethered agonist activity nor autoproteolysis was necessary for Lphn2s role as a repulsive ligand. Thus, tethered agonist activity is required for Lphn2-mediated neural circuit assembly in a context-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Several studies reported a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among white-tailed deer in North America. Monitoring cervids in all regions to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and circulation in other deer populations has been urged. To evaluate deer exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Poland, we sampled 90 reed deer individuals shot by hunters in five hunting districts in northeastern Poland. Serum and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, and then the Immunofluorescent Assay (IFA) to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was performed as well as real-time PCR with reverse transcription for direct virus detection. No positive samples were detected. There is no evidence of spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from the human to deer population in Poland.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox is an emerging, rapidly spreading disease with pandemic potential. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), a dsDNA virus from the Poxviridae family, that replicates in the cytoplasm and must encode for its own RNA processing machinery including the capping machinery. Here, we present the crystal structure of its 2-O-RNA methyltransferase (MTase) VP39 in complex with the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin. A comparison of this 2-O RNA MTase with enzymes from unrelated ssRNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and Zika) reveals a surprisingly conserved sinefungin binding mode implicating that a single inhibitor could be used against unrelated viral families.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes severe pathophysiology in vulnerable older populations and appears to be highly pathogenic and more transmissible than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [1, 2]. The spike (S) protein appears to be a major pathogenic factor that contributes to the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Although the S protein is a surface transmembrane type 1 glycoprotein, it has been predicted to be translocated into the nucleus due to the novel nuclear localization signal (NLS) \"PRRARSV\", which is absent from the S protein of other coronaviruses. Indeed, S proteins translocate into the nucleus in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our surprise, S mRNAs also translocate into the nucleus. S mRNA colocalizes with S protein, aiding the nuclear translocation of S mRNA. While nuclear translocation of nucleoprotein (N) has been shown in many coronaviruses, the nuclear translocation of both S mRNA and S protein reveals a novel pathogenic feature of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAuthor summaryOne of the novel sequence insertions resides at the S1/S2 boundary of Spike (S) protein and constitutes a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif \"PRRARSV\", which may supersede the importance of previously proposed polybasic furin cleavage site \"RRAR\". Indeed, S proteins NLS-driven nuclear translocation and its possible role in S mRNAs nuclear translocation reveal a novel pathogenic feature of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal regulation of the cellular transcriptome is crucial for proper protein expression and cellular function1. However, the intricate subcellular dynamics of RNA synthesis, decay, export, and translocation remain obscured due to the limitations of existing transcriptomics methods2-8. Here, we report a spatiotemporally resolved RNA mapping method (TEMPOmap) to uncover subcellular RNA profiles across time and space at the single-cell level in heterogeneous cell populations. TEMPOmap integrates pulse-chase metabolic labeling of the transcriptome with highly multiplexed three-dimensional (3D) in situ sequencing to simultaneously profile the age and location of individual RNA molecules. Using TEMPOmap, we constructed the subcellular RNA kinetic landscape of 991 genes in human HeLa cells from upstream transcription to downstream subcellular translocation. Clustering analysis of critical RNA kinetic parameters across single cells revealed kinetic gene clusters whose expression patterns were shaped by multi-step kinetic sculpting. Importantly, these kinetic gene clusters are functionally segregated, suggesting that subcellular RNA kinetics are differentially regulated to serve molecular and cellular functions in cell-cycle dependent manner. Together, these single-cell spatiotemporally resolved transcriptomics measurements provide us the gateway to uncover new gene regulation principles and understand how kinetic strategies enable precise RNA expression in time and space.",

    "abstract": "With the convergent global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), a precise comparison study of viral fitness and transmission characteristics is necessary for the prediction of dominant VOCs and the development of suitable countermeasures. While airway temperature plays important roles in the fitness and transmissibility of respiratory tract viruses, it has not been well studied with SARS-CoV-2. Here we demonstrate that natural temperature differences between the upper (33{degrees}C) and lower (37{degrees}C) respiratory tract have profound effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication and transmission. Specifically, SARS-COV-2 variants containing the P323L or P323L/G671S mutation in the NSP12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) exhibited enhanced RdRp enzymatic activity at 33{degrees}C compared to 37{degrees}C and high transmissibility in ferrets. MicroScale Thermophoresis demonstrated that the NSP12 P323L or P323L/G671S mutation stabilized the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex interaction. Furthermore, reverse genetics-derived SARS-CoV-2 variants containing the NSP12 P323L or P323L/G671S mutation displayed enhanced replication at 33{degrees}C, and high transmission in ferrets. This suggests that the evolutionarily forced NSP12 P323L and P323L/G671S mutations of recent SARS-CoV-2 VOC strains are associated with increases of the RdRp complex stability and enzymatic activity, promoting the high transmissibility.",

    "abstract": "Correlation among multiple phenotypes across related individuals may reflect some pattern of shared genetic architecture: individual genetic loci affect multiple phenotypes (an effect known as pleiotropy), creating observable relationships between phenotypes. A natural hypothesis is that pleiotropic effects reflect a relatively small set of common \"core\" cellular processes: each genetic locus affects one or a few core processes, and these core processes in turn determine the observed phenotypes. Here, we propose a method to infer such structure in genotype-phenotype data. Our approach, sparse structure discovery (SSD) is based on a penalized matrix decomposition designed to identify latent structure that is low-dimensional (many fewer core processes than phenotypes and genetic loci), locus-sparse (each locus affects few core processes) and/or phenotype-sparse (each phenotype is influenced by few core processes). Our use of sparsity as a guide in the matrix decomposition is motivated by the results of a novel empirical test indicating evidence of sparse structure in several recent genotype-phenotype data sets. First, we use synthetic data to show that our SSD approach can accurately recover core processes if each genetic locus affects few core processes or if each phenotype is affected by few core processes. Next, we apply the method to three datasets spanning adaptive mutations in yeast, genotoxin robustness assay in human cell lines, and genetic loci identified from a yeast cross, and evaluate the biological plausibility of the core process identified. More generally, we propose sparsity as a guiding prior for resolving latent structure in empirical genotype-phenotype maps.",
