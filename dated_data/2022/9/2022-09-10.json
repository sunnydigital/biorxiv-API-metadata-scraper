    "abstract": "Pannexins are single-membrane large-pore ion channels that release ATP upon activation. Three isoforms of pannexins, 1, 2, and 3, perform diverse cellular roles, including inflammation, differentiation, neuropathic pain, and ATP release. In this study, we report the cryoEM structure of pannexin 3 at 3.9 [A] and characterize the structural differences with pannexin isoforms 1 and 2. We observe the organization of the Pannexin 3 vestibule into two distinct chambers with a wider pore radius in comparison to both PANX1 and 2 isoforms. We further report the structure of pannexin1 congenital mutant R217H in the resolution range of 3.9 [A]. The congenital mutant R217H in transmembrane helix3 (TM3), R217H induce structural changes that leads to a partially closed pore and altered ATP interaction propensities. The channel conductance of the congenital mutant displays weakened voltage sensitivity. The results showcase a complete comparison of the three pannexin isoform structures that along with the structure of Pannexin 1 congenital mutant highlight distinct structural features of pannexin isoforms and the allosteric role of distant substitutions in dictating channel behavior in Pannexin 1.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics offers the possibility to screen for versatile biocatalysts. In this study, the microbial community of the Sorghum bicolor rhizosphere was spiked with technical cashew nut shell liquid, and after incubation, the eDNA was extracted and subsequently used to build a metagenomic library. We report the biochemical features and crystal structure of a novel esterase from the family IV, EH0, retrieved from an uncultured sphingomonad after a functional screen in tributyrin agar plates. EH0 (Topt, 50 {degrees}C; Tm, 55.7 {degrees}C; pHopt, 9.5) was stable in the presence of 10-20% v/v organic solvents and exhibited hydrolytic activity against p-nitrophenyl esters from acetate to palmitate, preferably butyrate (496 U mg-1), and a large battery of 69 structurally different esters (up to 30.2 U mg-1), including bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (0.16 {+/-} 0.06 U mg-1). This broad substrate specificity contrasts with the fact that EH0 showed a long and narrow catalytic tunnel, whose access appears to be hindered by a thigth folding of its cap domain. We propose that this cap domain is a highly flexible structure whose opening is mediated by unique structural elements, one of which is the presence of two contiguous proline residues likely acting as possible hinges, that altogether allow for the entrance of the substrates. Therefore, this work provides a new role for the cap domain, which until now was thought to be immobile elements that contain hydrophobic patches involved in substrate pre-recognition and in turn substrate specificity within family IV esterases.\n\nIMPORTANCEA better understanding of structure-function relationships of enzymes allows revealing key structural motifs or elements. Here, we studied the structural basis of the substrate promiscuity of EH0, a family IV esterase, isolated from a sample of the Sorghum bicolor rhizosphere microbiome exposed to technical cashew nut shell liquid. The analysis of EH0 revealed the potential of the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome as a source of enzymes with interesting properties, such as pH and solvent tolerance and remarkably broad substrate promiscuity. Its structure resembled those of homologous proteins from mesophilic Parvibaculum and Erythrobacter spp. and hyperthermophilic Pyrobaculum and Sulfolobus spp. and had a very narrow, single-entry access tunnel to the active site, access which is controlled by a capping domain that includes a number of not conserved proline residues. These structural markers, distinct from those of other substrate promiscuous esterases, can help tuning substrate profiles beyond tunnel and active site engineering.",

    "abstract": "Droplet microfluidics has become a powerful tool in life sciences, underlying digital assays, single-cell sequencing or directed evolution, and it is making foray in physical sciences as well. Imaging and incubation of droplets are crucial, yet they are encumbered by the poor optical, thermal and mechanical properties of PDMS - the de facto material for microfluidics. Here we show that silicon is an ideal material for droplet chambers. Si chambers pack droplets in a crystalline and immobile monolayer, are immune to evaporation or sagging, boost the number of collected photons, and tightly control the temperature field sensed by droplets. We use the mechanical and optical benefits of Si chambers to image [~]1 million of droplets from a multiplexed digital assay - with an acquisition rate similar to the best in-line methods. Lastly, we demonstrate their applicability with a demanding assay that maps the thermal dependence of Michaelis-Menten constants with an array of [~]150,000. The design of the Si chambers is streamlined to avoid complicated fabrication and improve reproducibility, which makes Silicon a complementary material to PDMS in the toolbox of droplet microfluidics.\n\nSignificance StatementAs the technological engine behind single-cell sequencing and digital assays, droplets microfluidics has revolutionized life science and molecular diagnosis, and is making foray into physical sciences as well. Observing droplets in a controlled manner is becoming crucial, but PDMS - the de facto material of microfluidics - hampers imaging and incubation.

    "abstract": "Photosynthetic light harvesting requires efficient energy transfer within dynamic networks of light harvesting complexes embedded within phospholipid membranes. Artificial light harvesting models are valuable tools for understanding the structural features underpinning energy absorption and transfer within chromophore arrays. Most artificial light harvesting complexes are static or in the solution phase, rather than in a two-dimensional fluid environment as in natural photosynthesis. We have developed a method for attaching a protein-based light harvesting model to a supported lipid bilayer (SLB), which provides an extended fluid membrane surface stably associated with a solid substrate. The protein model consisted of the tobacco mosaic viral capsid proteins (TMV) that were gene-doubled to create a tandem dimer (dTMV). Assemblies of dTMV were shown to break the facial symmetry of the double disk to allow for differentiation between the disk faces. Single reactive lysine and cysteine residues were incorporated into opposing surfaces of each monomer of the dTMV assemblies. This allowed for the site-selective attachment of both chromophores for light absorption and a peptide for attachment to the SLB. A cysteine modification strategy using the enzyme tyrosinase was employed for the bioconjugation of a peptide containing a polyhistidine tag for association with SLBs. The dual-modified dTMV complexes showed significant association with SLBs and exhibited mobility on the bilayer. The techniques used herein offer a new method for protein-surface attachment and provide a platform for evaluating excited state energy transfer events in a dynamic, fully synthetic artificial light harvesting system.\n\nSignificance StatementHere we have constructed a model photosynthetic membrane containing proteins, chromophores, lipids, and aqueous components, all of which can be modified in their composition. This model is based on an asymmetric disk assembly consisting of engineered tandem dimers of the tobacco mosaic viral capsid protein (dTMV). We have developed methods to achieve dye conjugation and attachment of a supported lipid bilayers (SLB) site selectively on distinct protein surfaces. These dye-labeled protein complexes exhibit mobility on the SLB, resulting in a dynamic model of light harvesting membranes using entirely synthetic components. Additionally, this unique asymmetric assembly of TMV and the facile methods for protein functionalization are expected to expand the tunability of model light harvesting systems.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens utilize a panoply of effectors to manipulate plant defense. However, despite their importance, relatively little is actually known about regulation of these virulence factors. Here, we show that the effector FolSvp1, secreted from fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) directly binds and translocates the tomato pathogenesis-related protein1, SlPR1, from the apoplast outside the plasma membrane to the host nucleus via its nuclear localization signal. Relocation of SlPR1 abolishes generation of the defense signaling peptide, CAPE1, from its C-terminus, and as a consequence, facilitates pathogen invasion of plants. The action of FolSvp1 requires covalent modification by acetylation for full virulence in host tomato tissues. The modification is catalyzed by the Fol FolArd1 lysine acetyltransferase prior to secretion. Addition of an acetyl group to one residue, K167, prevents ubiquitination-dependent degradation of FolSvp1 in both Fol and plant cells with different mechanisms, allowing it to function normally in fungal invasion. Either inactivation of FolSvp1 or removal of the acetyl group on K167 leads to impaired pathogenicity of Fol. These findings indicate that acetylation can regulate the stability of effectors of fungal plant pathogens with impact on virulence.",

    "abstract": "TOG family proteins, including the budding yeast Stu2, are essential for the formation of a functional mitotic spindle. Across all eukaryotes, the described functions of this family depend on two microtubule binding elements: TOG domain arrays, and a basic linker domain important for binding the microtubule lattice. Consistently, we find here that Stu2s basic linker is required for its ability to regulate microtubules in vitro, including stimulating microtubule growth, shrinkage, and catastrophe. We furthermore define a region contained within Stu2s basic linker domain as its nuclear localization sequence, and identify phospho-regulation that promotes mitosis-specific nuclear import. Surprisingly, directing nuclear localization is the only function contained within Stu2s basic linker that is required for cell viability, indicating that microtubule lattice binding is not required for Stu2s essential function. Considering that lattice binding is required to stimulate microtubule polymerization and depolymerization in vitro, these established activities are unlikely to be the essential functions carried out by Stu2 in the cells nucleus.\n\nSUMMARYStu2 is a TOG family protein that performs numerous microtubule regulatory functions in the cell. Here we show that Stu2s nuclear localization is essential for cell viability. Surprisingly, its required nuclear function is distinct from its canonical activities regulating microtubules.",

This process is temporally restricted to short developmental windows and generates HSPC with distinct capabilities for hematopoiesis. Although it is generally thought that adult hematopoiesis is sustained by HSCs derived from hemogenic endothelium during development, some observations point to EHT persistence in the late fetus/perinatally. Here we use lineage tracking and bioinformatics analysis to assess the presence of hemogenic endothelial cells in the adult mouse. Our analysis identifies a subset of bone marrow-resident adult endothelial cells, characterized by the expression of VE-Cadherin and the transcription factor RUNX1, that produce CD45+ hematopoietic cells. This EHT generates hematopoietic progenitors, and mature myeloid and lymphoid cells in the adult mouse. Our results reveal the identification of a distinct source of adult blood.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acquires unique properties for regulation of the neuronal function during development. The genesis of the BBB coupled with angiogenesis is orchestrated by the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway. Aside from the importance of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, the molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes are poorly understood. Here, we identify the brain endothelial adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr126 as a novel target gene of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling that is required for postnatal BBB development, and its expression is detrimental for ischemic stroke in adults. We show that Gpr126 expression is high in mouse brain endothelium during BBB formation, but decreases in the adult. Inactivation of Gpr126 in postnatal endothelial cells results in vessel enlargement and impairs acquisition of the BBB characteristics, such as increased neurovascular permeability, and reduced basement membrane protein deposition and pericyte coverage. Mechanistically, Gpr126 is required during developmental angiogenesis to promote endothelial cell migration, acting via an interaction between Lrp1 and 3{beta}1-integrin, which couples vessel morphogenesis to BBB formation. Interestingly, in adult mice with an established BBB, the lack of Gpr126 expression in acute ischemic stroke is protective and coupled with reduced microglia activation, which contributes to an improved neurological outcome. These data identify Gpr126 as a promising therapeutic target to treat ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Unlike its counterpart Ser/Thr kinases, the predominant Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a promiscuous enzyme that gains its subcellular localization and substrate specificity from a large panel of regulatory proteins with which it associates in predominantly dimeric complexes. Inhibition of specific PP1-mediated dephosphorylation events relies on targeting the regulatory rather than the catalytic subunit, which in turn relies on a comprehensive understanding of the holoenzyme complexes that underlie its distribution throughout the cell. Proteomic, bioinformatic and biochemical screens have assembled lists of putative regulatory proteins, which have been studied to varying degrees. We took a non-biased approach to link steady-state localization to complexes, using a combination of fluorescence imaging, cellular fractionation and quantitative affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS) to map interactomes for PP1[a]/{beta}/{gamma} in 3 human cell lines. Comparing the distribution of each isoform between the pool of identified regulatory subunits highlighted key signaling pathways and identified c20orf27 as a novel PP1 regulatory protein. Steady-state association of a large fraction of PP1 with the evolutionarily conserved SDS22 was demonstrated, as was redistribution at the entry to mitosis. This is consistent with recent work suggesting that SDS22 acts as a PP1 sink from which it can be recruited as needed. Moving forward, this approach can be used to assess the redistribution of PP1 during other cellular processes or in response to perturbations or disease states, facilitating identification of the relevant complexes and the design of strategies to target them therapeutically.",

Functionally, 4EBP1/2 inhibit fatty acid synthesis upon energetic stress via repression of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Alpha (ACACA) mRNA translation, sparing NADPH, to maintain intracellular redox balance. This has important relevance in cancers, as we uncovered that oncogene-transformed cells and glioma cells exploit the 4EBP1/2 regulation of ACACA expression and redox balance to combat energetic stress, thereby supporting transformation and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, high EIF4EBP1 (encoding 4EBP1) expression is associated with poor outcomes in several cancer types, including glioma.

    "abstract": "The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a closed mitosis in which the mitotic spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) used to segregate chromosomes remain separated by the nuclear envelope throughout the cell cycle. Kar3, the yeast kinesin-14, has unique roles in both compartments and has been implicated in capturing unattached kinetochores, stabilizing crosslinked interpolar microtubules (MT), and creating intranuclear and cytoplasmic MT arrays at the spindle pole body for kinetochore capture and karyogamy, respectively. Here, we show that two proteins, Cik1 and Vik1, that form heterodimers with Kar3, regulate its localization and function within the cell and along MTs in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Using a cell cycle synchronized, yeast MT dynamics reconstitution assay in cell lysate, we found that Kar3Vik1 induces MT catastrophes in S phase and metaphase and limits MT polymerization in G1 and anaphase. In contrast, Kar3Cik1 is a catastrophe and pause promoter in G1, while increasing catastrophes in metaphase and anaphase. Adapting this assay to track single-molecules, we saw that Kar3Cik1 is necessary for tracking MT plus-ends in S phase and metaphase, but, surprisingly, not during anaphase. These experiments demonstrate how the binding partners of Kar3 modulate its diverse functions both spatially and temporally.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTWe show through biochemical reconstitution experiments and live-cell imaging that the functions and localization of the budding yeast kinesin-14, Kar3, are dictated by which of its two accessory protein binding partners, Cik1 or Vik1, it binds to and by the cell cycle stage.",

    "abstract": "Pseudokinases, so named because they lack one or more conserved canonical amino acids that define their catalytically-active relatives, have evolved a variety of biological functions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Human PSKH2 is closely related to the canonical kinase PSKH1, which maps to the CAMK family of protein kinases. Primates encode PSKH2 in the form of a pseudokinase, which is predicted to be catalytically inactive due to loss of the invariant catalytic Asp residue. Although the biological role(s) of vertebrate PSKH2s remains unclear, we previously identified species-level adaptions in PSKH2 that have led to the appearance of kinase or pseudokinase variants in vertebrate genomes alongside a canonical PSKH1 paralog. In this paper we confirm that, as predicted, PSKH2 lacks detectable protein phosphotransferase activity, and exploit structural informatics, biochemistry and cellular proteomics to begin to characterise vertebrate PSKH2 orthologues. AlphaFold 2-based structural analysis predicts functional roles for both the PSKH2 N- and C-regions that flank the pseudokinase domain core, and cellular truncation analysis confirms that the N-terminal domain, which contains a conserved myristoylation site, is required for both stable human PSKH2 expression and localisation to a membrane-rich subcellular fraction containing mitochondrial proteins. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we confirm that human PSKH2 is part of a cellular mitochondrial protein network, and that its expression is regulated through client-status within the HSP90/Cdc37 molecular chaperone system. HSP90 interactions are mediated through binding to the PSKH2 C-terminal tail, leading us to predict that this region might act as both a cis and trans regulatory element, driving outputs linked to the PSKH2 pseudokinase domain that are important for functional signalling.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a devastating disease that resulted in an estimated 627,000 deaths in 2020. About 80% of those deaths were among children under the age of five. Our approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors against cytoskeletal targets that are vital components of parasite function, essential at multiple stages of parasite infection, can be targeted with high specificity, and are highly druggable. Here we describe KNX-115, which inhibits purified Plasmodium falciparum myosin A (PfMyoA) actin-activated ATPase with a potency in the 10s of nanomolar range and >50-fold selectivity against cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle myosins. KNX-115 inhibits the blood and liver stages of Plasmodium with an EC50 of about 100 nanomolar, with negligible liver cell toxicity. In addition, KNX-115 inhibits sporozoite cell traversal and blocks the gametocyte to oocyst conversion in the mosquito. KNX-115 displays a similar killing profile to pyrimethamine and parasites are totally killed after 96 hours of treatment. In line with its novel mechanism of action, KNX-115 is equally effective at inhibiting a panel of Plasmodium strains resistant to experimental and marketed antimalarials. In vitro evolution data likely suggests a refractory potential of KNX-115 in developing parasite resistance.",

    "abstract": "The contractile ring plays crucial roles in animal morphogenesis. Previous studies have explored how tissue mechanics controls the contractile ring; however, the mechanisms by which the ring senses tissue mechanics remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism of contractile ring mechanosensation and its tuning during asymmetric ring closure of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. High-resolution imaging of cortical flow revealed that local suppression of the ring-directed cortical flow is associated with a delay in furrowing. This suppression of cortical flow results from cortical compression. We found that the artificial inhibition of ring-directed cortical flow was sufficient to induce asymmetric ring closure in symmetrically dividing cells. Moreover, genetic analysis suggests that the positive feedback loop among ring-directed cortical flow, myosin enrichment, and ring constriction constitutes the anillin-dependent, mechanosensitive engine driving asymmetric ring closure. Our results suggest that the balance between RhoA-dependent and cortical flow-dependent myosin enrichment fine-tunes the rings mechanosensitivity in tissues.",

    "abstract": "The subcellular localization, activity and substrate specificity of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1 cat) is mediated through its dynamic association with regulatory subunits in holoenzyme complexes. While some functional overlap is observed for the three human PP1cat isoforms, they also show distinct targeting based on relative preferences for specific regulatory subunits. A well-known example is the preferential association of MYPT1 with PP1{beta} in the myosin phosphatase complex. In smooth muscle, MYPT1/ PP1{beta} counteracts the muscle contraction induced by phosphorylation of the light chains of myosin by the myosin light chain kinase. This phosphatase complex is also found in non-muscle cells, where it is targeted to both myosin and non-myosin substrates and contributes to regulation of the balance of cytoskeletal structure and motility during cell migration and division. Although it remains unclear how MYPT1/PP1{beta} traffics between microtubule- and actin-associated substrates, our identification of the microtubule- and actin-binding protein SPECC1L in both the PP1{beta} and MYPT1 interactomes suggested that it may be the missing link. Validation of their association, together with the strong overlap that we observed for the SPECC1L and MYPT1 interactomes, suggested that they exist in a stable complex in the cell. We further showed that SPECC1L binds MYPT1 directly, and that it can impact the balance of the distribution of the MYPT1/ PP1{beta} complex between the microtubule and filamentous actin networks.",

    "abstract": "As cells migrate through biological tissues, they must frequently squeeze through micron-sized constrictions in the form of interstitial pores between extracellular matrix fibers and/or other cells. Although it is now well recognized that such confined migration is limited by the nucleus, which is the largest and stiffest organelle, it remains incompletely understood how cells apply sufficient force to move their nucleus through small constrictions. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which contraction of the cell rear cortex pushes the nucleus forward to mediate nuclear transit through constrictions. Laser ablation of the rear cortex reveals that pushing forces behind the nucleus are the result of increased intracellular pressure in the rear compartment of the cell. The pushing forces behind the nucleus depend on accumulation of actomyosin in the rear cortex and require Rho-kinase (ROCK) activity. Collectively, our results suggest a novel mechanism by which cells generate elevated, intracellular pressure in the posterior compartment to facilitate nuclear transit through 3D constrictions. This mechanism may supplement or even substitute for other mechanisms supporting nuclear transit, ensuring robust cell migrations in confined 3D environments.",

    "abstract": "Proteins ZC3HC1 and TPR are construction elements of the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-attached nuclear basket (NB). NB-location of ZC3HC1 depends on TPR already occurring NPC-anchored, whereas additional TPR polypeptides are appended to the NB by ZC3HC1. The current study examined the molecular properties of ZC3HC1 that enable it to bind to the NB and TPR. We report the identification and definition of a nuclear basket-interaction domain (NuBaID) of HsZC3HC1 comprising two similarly built modules, both essential for the binding to the NBs NPC-anchored HsTPR. Furthermore, we describe such a bimodular construction as evolutionarily conserved and exemplify the kinship of HsZC3HC1 by the NB- and DdTPR-interacting homolog of Dictyostelium discoideum and by characterizing protein Pml39 as the ZC3HC1 homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among several properties shared by the different species homologs, we unveil the integrity of the bimodular NuBaID of ScPml39p as being essential for binding to the yeasts NBs and its TPR homologs ScMlp1p and ScMlp2p, and we further present Pml39p as enabling interlinkage of Mlp1p subpopulations. In addition to phyla-specific features, we delineate the three species common NuBaID as the characterizing structural entity of a one-of-a-kind protein found not in all but likely most taxa of the eukaryotic realm.",
