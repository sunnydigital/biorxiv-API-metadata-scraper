    "abstract": "Motion is one of the fundamental qualities not only of vision, but also of touch. Manipulation and exploration of objects involves different forms of movement between the skin and objects. A different form of tactile motion from remote sources is through substrate vibrations, and is present in arthropods such as insects and spiders, enabling them to localise approaching preys and predators. Here, we quantify the extent to humans perceive tactile motion based on vibrations sensed by fingertips. We employed a novel stimulation paradigm in which a pair of vibrations (100 Hz) with sinusoidal envelopes (0.5 cycle/s) and various phase differences between the two vibrations were delivered to two fingertips. The phase difference between the vibrations generated perception of a virtual motion across the fingertips. The findings suggest that human tactile system possesses the sensory channel for detection of motion through substrate vibrations, which is fundamentally different from tactile motion mechanisms during active surface exploration. We propose two potential neural computations underlying processing this form of motion; one based on phase difference or time delay detection, and the second based on temporal order and interval duration processing.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction and aggregation of the RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, is the unifying hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mechanisms and relative contributions of concurrent TDP-43 nuclear depletion, cytoplasmic accumulation, and post-translational modification to neurodegeneration remain unresolved. We employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated fluorescent tagging to investigate how disease-associated stressors and pathological TDP-43 alter abundance, localisation, self-assembly, aggregation, solubility, and mobility dynamics of endogenous TDP-43 over time. Oxidative stress stimulated TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation into droplets or spherical shell-like  anisosomes, which were not formed by over-expressed wild-type TDP-43. Further, nuclear RNA-binding-ablated or acetylation-mimicking TDP-43 rapidly formed anisosomes and inclusions that readily sequestered and depleted free normal nuclear TDP-43. The majority of total endogenous TDP-43 was sequestered into anisosomes, but retained high protein mobility and solubility. However, cytoplasmic RNA-deficient TDP-43 formed large phosphorylated inclusions that occasionally sequestered endogenous TDP-43, rendering it insoluble and immobile, indicating irreversible pathological transition. These findings suggest that post-translational modification and RNA-binding deficiency exacerbate TDP-43 aggregation and dysfunction by driving sequestration, mislocalisation, and depletion of normal nuclear TDP-43 in ALS and FTD.",

    "abstract": "The ovarian hormone estrogens promote binge alcohol drinking and contribute to sex differences in alcohol use disorder. However, the mechanisms for estrogen-induced binge drinking are largely unknown. This study aims to test if estrogens act on 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (5-HTDRN) to promote binge drinking. We used the drinking in the dark (DID) behavioral test in mice to mimic binge drinking in humans. We found that female mice drank more alcohol than male mice in chronic DID tests. This sex difference was associated with distinct alterations in mRNA expression of estrogen receptor  (ER) and 5-HT-related genes in the DRN, suggesting a potential role of estrogen/ERs/5-HT signaling in binge alcohol drinking. In supporting this view, 5-HTDRN neurons from naive male mice had lower baseline neuronal firing activity but higher sensitivity to alcohol-induced excitation compared to 5-HTDRN neurons from naive female mice. Notably, this higher sensitivity was blunted by 17{beta}-estradiol treatment in males, indicating an estrogen-dependent mechanism. We further showed that both ER and ER{beta} are expressed in 5-HTDRN neurons, whereas ER agonist propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) depolarizes 5-HTDRN neurons and ER{beta} agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) hyperpolarizes 5-HTDRN neurons. Notably, both PPT and DPN treatments blocked the stimulatory effects of alcohol on 5-HTDRN neurons in males, despite the fact that they have antagonistic effects on the activity dynamics of 5-HTDRN neurons. These results suggest that ERs inhibitory effects on ethanol-induced burst firing of 5-HTDRN neurons may contribute to higher levels of binge drinking in females. Consistently, chemogenetic activation of ER- or ER{beta}-expressing neurons in the DRN reduced binge alcohol drinking. These results support a model in which estrogens act on ER/{beta} to prevent alcohol-induced activation of 5-HTDRN neurons, which in return leads to higher binge alcohol drinking.",

    "abstract": "During states of behavioral quiescence, neurons in the hippocampus replay sequences of spiking activity experienced in earlier behavioral episodes. While such replay sequences are hypothesized to serve learning and memory by facilitating synaptic consolidation, their generative mechanisms remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence suggests that they might be generated internally, or at least strongly constrained by internal circuit dynamics. Recent work demonstrated that, across the forebrain, approximately 70% of neurons participate in a pattern of sequential spiking cascades during rest. Like hippocampal replay sequences, these brain-wide spiking cascades occur together with high-frequency hippocampal ripples and therefore may share a common generative mechanism. Here we systematically investigated the relationship between replay activity and sequential spiking cascades by analyzing a database of intracortical electrocortical recordings in mice. For neuronal subpopulations in the hippocampus and visual cortex, we assessed spiking sequences elicited during video viewing as well as potential replay events during subsequent periods of rest. We found that replay events were unique to hippocampal time-sensitive neurons and occurred together with spiking cascades throughout the forebrain. Furthermore, forward and time-reversed replay sequences were associated with different types of spiking cascades. Overall, these findings indicate that hippocampal replay events are generated and structured according to resting state circuit dynamics manifest across a large portion of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is involved in the regulation of affective behavior and shows antidepressant effects through Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. NUDT6 is a protein encoded from FGF2 genes antisense strand and its role in the regulation of affective behavior is unclear. Here, we show that increasing NUDT6 expression in the hippocampus results in depression-like behavior in rats without changing FGF2 levels or activating its downstream effectors, Akt and ERK1/2. Instead, NUDT6 acts by inducing inflammatory signaling, specifically by increasing S100A9 levels, activating NF-{kappa}B and rising microglia number along with a reduction in neurogenesis. Conversely, inhibition of hippocampal NUDT6 expression by shRNA results in antidepressant effects and increases neurogenesis without altering FGF2 levels. Together these findings suggest that NUDT6 may play a role in major depression by inducing a proinflammatory state and serve as a novel therapeutic target for antidepressant development. This is the first report of an antisense protein acting through a different mechanism of action than regulation of its sense protein. The opposite effects of NUDT6 and FGF2 on depression-like behavior may serve as a mechanism to fine-tune affective behavior. Our findings open up new venues for studying the differential regulation and functional interactions of sense and antisense proteins in neural function and behavior as well as in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

In this work, an attempt was made to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism by obtaining a comprehensive measure of the contributing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its relationship to the NBR in the human visual cortex, in comparison to a simultaneously induced PBR in surrounding visual regions. To overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of CBF measurements, a newly developed multi-echo version of a center-out echo planar-imaging (EPI) readout was employed with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL). It achieved very short echo and inter-echo times and facilitated a simultaneous detection of functional CBF and BOLD changes at 3 T with improved sensitivity. Evaluations of the absolute and relative changes of CBF and the effective transverse relaxation rate, [Formula], the coupling ratios, and their dependence on CBF at rest, CBFrest, indicated differences between activated and deactivated regions.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite successful recanalization to treat acute ischemic stroke, reperfusion failure associated with poor functional outcomes develops in half of the patients. The cause of reperfusion failure remains the subject of intensive research. Here, we explore the possibility that spreading depolarization (SD), a potent ischemic injury mechanism is a significant contributor and reliable predictor of reperfusion failure.\n\nMethodsYoung adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (n=69) were anesthetized with isoflurane (0.6-0.9%) and prepared for transcranial optical imaging. After 10 min of baseline, incomplete global forebrain ischemia was induced by transient (45 min) bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion, followed by 75 min reperfusion. SD and cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes were visualized with intrinsic optical signal imaging and laser speckle contrast imaging. To block SD, the irreversible NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 was applied (0.3 mg/kg, i.p., n=29). Neurological deficit was evaluated at baseline and post-ischemia with a composite Garcia Neuroscore scale. Collaterals of the circle of Willis were examined after loading the vasculature with carbon black ink. Ischemic neuronal injury was evaluated in hematoxylin-eosin-stained brain sections.\n\nResultsSD emerged after ischemia onset in one or both hemispheres under a perfusion threshold (CBF drop to 21.1{+/-}4.6 vs. 33.6{+/-}4.4 %, SD vs. no SD). The failure of later reperfusion (44.4{+/-}12.5 %) was invariably linked to previous ischemic SD. In contrast, reperfusion was adequate (98.9{+/-}7.4 %) in hemispheres devoid of SD during ischemia. CBF reduced below the perfusion threshold of SD, when the P1 segment was absent in the circle of Willis. SD occurrence and the linked reperfusion failure were associated with poor neurologic function, and greater neuronal necrosis. The inhibition of SD with MK801 significantly improved reperfusion.\n\nConclusionsSD occurrence during ischemia impairs later reperfusion, prognosticating poor functional outcomes. The increased likelihood of SD occurrence is predicted by inadequate collaterals.",

We herein demonstrated that mice lacking the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) exhibited the hyper-obese phenotype when fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. However, Ptpro-KO mice with hyperobesity showed the markedly small accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver, improvements in lipid and glucose homeostasis, and low-grade systemic inflammation associated with low macrophage activation. Expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b (Ptp1b), an enzyme which is known to be implicated in metabolic disorders, was also suppressed in Ptpro-KO mice. The administration of AKB9778, a specific inhibitor of PTPRO, to highly obese ob/ob mice reproduced the phenotypes of Ptpro-KO mice along with the amelioration of inflammation. We revealed that an increase in the phosphorylation of Tyr(117) in vimentin, a component of intermediate filaments, by the inhibition of PTPRO promoted the growth of lipid droplets in adipocytes. The improvement in metabolic conditions with the attenuation of inflammation in Ptpro-KO mice was explained by the low activation of NF{kappa}b, a key transcription factor for inflammatory response, in adipose tissue.

    "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease is highest among the elderly. There is a need to further understand the mechanisms behind endothelial cell aging in order to achieve vascular rejuvenation and minimize the onset of age-related vascular diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to regulate numerous processes in the human genome, yet their function in vascular aging and their therapeutic potential remain largely unknown. This is primarily because the majority of studies investigating the impact of aging on lncRNA expression heavily rely on in vitro studies based on replicative senescence. Here, using a unique collection of young and aged endothelial cells isolated from native human arteries, we sought to characterize the age-related alterations in lncRNA expression profiles. We were able to detect a total of 4463 lncRNAs expressed in the human endothelium from which [~]17% (798) were altered in advanced age. One of the most affected lncRNAs in aging was the primate-specific, Prostate Cancer Associated Transcript (PCAT) 14. In our follow up analysis, using single molecule RNA FISH, we showed that PCAT14 is relatively abundant, localized almost exclusively in the nucleus of young endothelial cells, and silenced in the aged endothelium. Functionally, our studies proposed that PCAT14 affects multiple endothelial cell functions including endothelial cell migration, sprouting and inflammatory responses. Taken together, our data highlight that endothelial cell aging correlates with altered expression of lncRNAs, which could impair the endothelial regenerative capacity and enhance inflammatory phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory neurogenesis occurs continuously throughout the lives of vertebrates, including in humans, and relies on the rapid, unceasing differentiation and integration of neurons into a complex multicellular network. The system-wide regulation of this intricate choreography is poorly understood; in particular, it is unclear how progenitor cells convert stochastic fluctuations in cell-cell signaling, over both space and time, into streamlined fate decisions. Here, we track single-cell level multicellular dynamics in the developing zebrafish olfactory epithelium, perturb signaling pathways with temporal specificity, and find that the continuous generation of neurons is driven by the spatially-restricted self-assembly of transient groups of progenitor cells, i.e. cellular neighborhoods. Stochastic modeling and validation of the underlying genetic circuit reveals that neighborhood self-assembly is driven by a tightly regulated bistable toggle switch between Notch signaling and the transcription factor Insulinoma-associated 1a that is responsive to inter-organ retinoic acid signaling. Newly differentiating neurons emerge from neighborhoods and, in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling, migrate across the olfactory epithelium to take up residence as apically-located, mature sensory neurons. After developmental olfactory neurogenesis is complete, inducing injury results in a robust expansion of neighborhoods, followed by neuroregeneration. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into how stochastic signaling networks spatially pattern and regulate a delicate balance between progenitors and their neuronal derivatives to drive sustained neurogenesis during both development and regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for ecosystem conservation, yet field data collection is limited by costs, time, and extent. Remote sensing represents a convenient approach providing frequent, near-real-time information over wide areas. According to the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), spectral diversity (SD) is an effective proxy of environmental heterogeneity, which ultimately relates to plant diversity. So far, studies testing the relationship between SD and biodiversity have reported contradictory findings, calling for a thorough investigation of the key factors (e.g., metrics applied, ecosystem type) and the conditions under which such a relationship holds true. This study investigates the applicability of the SVH for plant diversity monitoring at the landscape scale by comparing the performance of three different types of SD metrics. Species richness and functional diversity were calculated for more than 2000 cells forming a grid covering the Czech Republic. Within each cell, we quantified SD using a Landsat-8 \"greenest pixel\" composite by applying: i) the standard deviation of NDVI, ii) Raos Q entropy index, and iii) richness of \"spectral communities\". Habitat type (i.e., land cover) was included in the models describing the relationship between SD and ground biodiversity. Both species richness and functional diversity show positive and significant relationships with each SD metric tested. However, SD alone accounts for a small fraction of the deviance explained by the models. Furthermore, the strength of the relationship depends significantly on habitat type and is highest in natural transitional areas. Our results underline that, despite the stability in the significance of the link between SD and plant diversity at this scale, the applicability of SD for biodiversity monitoring is context-dependent and the factors mediating such a relationship must be carefully considered to avoid drawing misleading conclusions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPlant species richness and functional diversity show significant and positive relationships with spectral diversity\nC_LIO_LISpectral diversity alone explains a small fraction of the total variability in ground biodiversity\nC_LIO_LISlight differences among the performances of the spectral diversity metrics tested\nC_LIO_LIThe relationship between spectral and plant diversity is context-dependent\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Fertility is a major component of fitness but its genetic architecture remains poorly understood. Using a full diallel cross of 50 Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel inbred lines with full genome sequences, we found substantial genetic variation in fertility largely attributable to females. We mapped genes associated with variation in female fertility by genome-wide association analysis of common variants in the fly genome. Validation of candidate genes by RNAi knockdown confirmed the role of the dopamine 2-like receptor (Dop2R) in promoting egg laying. We replicated the Dop2R effect in an independently collected productivity dataset and showed that the effect of the Dop2R variant was mediated in part by regulatory gene expression variation. This study demonstrates the strong potential of genome-wide association analysis in this diverse panel of inbred strains and subsequent functional analyses for understanding the genetic architecture of fitness traits.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn evolutionary genetics, fitness is defined as the number of offspring an individual contributes to the next generation. This is determined by an individuals viability (its ability to survive past the reproductive age) and its fertility. Although understanding the genetic basis for natural variation in fitness is a major goal of evolutionary and population genetics, the genetic factors that contribute to variation in fertility in natural populations have remained largely unresolved. To address this issue, we took advantage of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, a population of inbred, sequenced fly lines derived from a natural population. In this panel, there is minimal genetic variation among individuals within each line, whereas variation among the lines reflects the variation observed in the original population from which they were derived. We generated all possible pairwise crosses among 50 of these lines (2,500 distinct genotypes) and measured the productivity (number of offspring produced) for each genotype. We found considerable natural variation in productivity that was primarily determined by the female genotype. We performed a genome wide association as analysis and identified and functionally validated a dopamine receptor that plays a major role in determining variation in female fertility through an effect on egg-laying.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of DNA sequences in global populations are not present in the human reference genome, named nonreference sequence (NRS). Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies enable better discovery of NRS with large length, particularly in repetitive regions. Here, we de novo assembled 539 genomes in five genetically divergent human populations sequenced by LRS technology and identified 5.1 million NRSs. These NRSs were merged into 45,284 nonredundant NRSs, of which 66.2% were novel. 78.5% of NRSs were repeat sequences, such as VNTR and STR. 38.7% of NRSs were common in the five populations, 35.6% were population specific, while 21.3% were ancestral and present in nonhuman primates. 144 NRS hotspots spanned 141 Mb of the human genome and many NRSs contained known functional domains or intersected with coding genes. Based on graph-based pangenome, we detected 565 transcript expression quantitative trait loci on NRSs, of which 467 were novel. We also detected 39 NRS candidates for adaptive selection within the human population related to the language system and diabetes. GWAS revealed 14 NRSs significantly associated with eight phenotypes, such as anaemia. Furthermore, we identified 154 NRSs in strong linkage disequilibrium with 258 phenotype-associated SNPs in the GWAS catalogue. Our work expands the landscape of human NRS and provides novel insights into functions of NRS to facilitate evolutionary and biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Specific microRNAs expressions may accurately characterize different stages of canine myxomatous mitral valve disease. This preliminary study aimed to (1) describe the clinical and echocardiographic parameters of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease at different American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stages (B1, B2 and C) and healthy control group (ACVIM A), comparing the parameters collected during the first examination (T0) and the end of the follow-up (T1); (2) assess the association between the values of echocardiographic parameters at T1 and the expression profile of miR-30b-5p at T0. Thirty-five Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (median age 4.29 years and median weight 9 Kg) in different ACVIM stages were included (7 A, 19 B1, 6 B2 and 3 C). Inverse probability weighting analysis was performed to estimate the association of the exposure variable (miR-30b-5p) with the outcome variables (clinical and echocardiographic variables). Time was included as variable.\n\nThe results pointed out that high levels of plasma miR-30b-5p corresponded to lower values of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter normalized for body weight, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes indexed for body weight, and left atrium-to aortic root ratio. Hence, higher miR-30b-5p expressions were associated with milder forms of mitral valve disease in our study population. In contrast, the results obtained for the intensity of heart murmur, the mitral regurgitation severity, and the Mitral INsufficiency Echocardiographic score) were not statistically significant. A relationship between high abundance of miR-30b-5p and myxomatous mitral valve disease that appear echocardiographically more stable over time has been demonstrated. In conclusion, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease that at the first cardiologic evaluation showed an upregulation of miR-30b-5p are expected to experience lesser variations on their echocardiographic examination between T0 and T1.",

Yet, the bottleneck remains to generate complex organoids with body axis patterning, as well as keeping the orientation of organoid samples during post-experiment analysis processes. In this paper, we present a workflow for culturing organoids with gradient using a previously developed CUBE culture device, then sectioning samples with the CUBE to retain information on the gradient direction of the sample. We show that hiPSC spheroids cultured with separate differentiation media on two opposing ends of the CUBE resulted in localized expressions of the respective differentiation markers, in contrast to homogeneous distribution of markers in controls with the same media on both ends. We also describe the processes for cryo and paraffin sectioning of gradient-cultured spheroids in CUBE to retain gradient orientation information. This workflow from gradient culture to sectioning with CUBE can provide researchers with a convenient tool to generate increasingly complex organoids and study their developmental processes in vitro.",

    "abstract": "In biology, regeneration is a mysterious phenomenon that has inspired self-repairing systems, robots, and biobots. It is a collective computational process whereby cells communicate to achieve an anatomical set point and restore original function in regenerated tissue or the whole organism. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms involved in this process are still poorly understood. Likewise, the current algorithms are insufficient to overcome this knowledge barrier and enable advances in regenerative medicine, synthetic biology, and living machines/biobots. We propose a comprehensive conceptual framework for the engine of regeneration with hypotheses for the mechanisms and algorithms of stem cell-mediated regeneration that enables a system like the planarian flatworm to fully restore anatomical (form) and bioelectric (function) homeostasis from any small- or large-scale damage. The framework extends the available regeneration knowledge with novel hypotheses to propose collective intelligent self-repair machines, with multi-level feedback neural control systems, driven by somatic and stem cells. We computationally implemented the framework to demonstrate the robust recovery of both anatomical and bioelectric homeostasis in an in silico worm that, in a simple way, resembles the planarian. In the absence of complete regeneration knowledge, the framework contributes to understanding and generating hypotheses for stem cell mediated form and function regeneration which may help advance regenerative medicine and synthetic biology. Further, as our framework is a bio-inspired and bio-computing self-repair machine, it may be useful for building self-repair robots/biobots and artificial self-repair systems.\n\nSummaryA conceptual framework for the machinery of self-repair in living systems that enables a synthetic organism to accurately regenerate form and function from any disturbance and damage.",

Currently, allele-specific expression (ASE) studies focus almost exclusively on genetic variants explaining expression differences (cis-eQTLs), largely ignoring other ASE effects. The latter are typically associated with higher variance in expression of both copies of a gene, here called Allelic Divergence (AD). We therefore developed an RNAseq-driven population-level beta-binomial mixture model for (differential) AD detection. The model simultaneously enables RNAseq-driven genotyping, which outperforms alternative RNA genotyping methods when applied on healthy kidney data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Moreover, we identify well-known non-cis-eQTL ASE, e.g. random monoallelic expression of HLA and immunoglobulin genes in healthy kidney, as well as allele-specific aberrations in clear cell kidney carcinoma, including long-range epigenetic silencing of protocadherins, copy-number alterations, and loss of imprinting.

    "abstract": "Exocytosis is a dynamic physiological process that enables the release of biomolecules to the surrounding environment via the fusion of membrane compartments to the plasma membrane. Defects in exocytosis could compromise essential biological functions so that it is crucial to elucidate the fundamentals of the exocytosis mechanisms. The development of pH-sensitive optical reporters alongside Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy has greatly expanded the knowledge of exocytosis, allowing the assessment of individual vesicle exocytosis events on a single-cell basis. The amount of data generated by live-cell imaging approaches poses the need of an analytical tool to identify and quantify the dynamics of exocytic events with high accuracy from fluorescent time series. Manual annotation represents a time-consuming task, and prone to selection biases and human operational errors.\n\nIn this work, we report the development of ExoJ, an ImageJ2/Fiji-based plugin to automate the detection of exocytic events in single-cell studies. The pipeline of ExoJ entirely relies on a set of user-customizable parameters to identify and further quantify features of exocytic events such as the intensity, the apparent size and the duration of the process. ExoJ proposes a user-friendly interface with multiple optional tools to visualize features for individual exocytic events and/or the whole cell population events. To illustrate the capacity of the plugin, we recorded exocytic events reported by several tetraspanins (TSPANs) and vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors (v-SNAREs) proteins, coupled to pHluorin. Using ExoJ, we characterize the dynamics of the exocytic event population reported by these two families of proteins. We showcase a similar fusion intensity but significantly distinct dynamics among TSPAN subpopulation. In particular, TSPAN CD9-pHluorin subpopulation displays a fast and similar dynamics to v-SNARE populations.\n\nExoJ is a user-friendly plugin to detect exocytic events in a supervised manner. We designed ExoJ to be fully user-controllable at each step of the pipeline. We argue the user-oriented plugin is a useful tool to search, monitor and quantify the dynamic aspect of content release during exocytosis.",

Using breast tumour specimens, gene expression data from public datasets and in-vitro and in-vivo model systems we have shown that low-levels of miR-18a in ER-negative tumours drives enrichment of hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal (E/M) cells with luminal attributes. On inhibition of miR-18a in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines, the cells showed traits of increased migration, stemness and drug-resistance. miR-18a/low tumours were also associated with increased expression of genes associated with EMT, stemness, drug resistance and immune-suppression. Further analysis of the miR-18a targets pointed out at a possible HIF-1 mediated signalling in these tumours. HIF-1 inhibition reduced the enrichment of the hybrid E/M cells and decreased the migratory ability of miR-18a/low cells. Our study reports for the first time a dual role of miR-18a in breast cancer that is subtype specific based on hormone receptor expression and a novel association of low miR-18a levels and enrichment of hybrid E/M cells. The results highlight the possibility of stratifying the ER-negative disease into clinically relevant groups by analysing epigenetic signatures.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe Arabidopsis PROSCOOP genes belong to a family predicted to encode secreted propeptides which undergo maturation steps to produce peptides named SCOOP. Some of them are involved in defence signalling through their perception by a receptor complex including MIK2, BAK1 and BKK1. Here, we focused on the PROSCOOP10 gene which is highly and constitutively expressed in the aerial organs. The MS/MS analyses of leaf apoplastic fluids allowed the identification of two distinct peptides, named SCOOP10#1 and SCOOP10#2, covering two different regions of PROSCOOP10. They both possess the canonical S-X-S family motif and have hydroxylated prolines. This identification in apoplastic fluids confirms for the first time the biological reality of SCOOP peptides. NMR and molecular dynamics studies showed that the SCOOP10 peptides, although largely unstructured in solution, tend to assume a hairpin-like fold exposing the two serine residues previously identified as essential for the peptide activity. Furthermore, PROSCOOP10 mutations led to an early flowering phenotype and an increased expression of the floral integrators SOC1 and LEAFY, consistent with the transcription of PROSCOOP10 in several mutants displaying an early or late flowering phenotype. These results suggest a role of PROSCOOP10 in flowering time, illustrating the functional complexity of the PROSCOOP family.\n\nHO_SCPLOWIGHLIGHTC_SCPLOWThe PROSCOOP10 gene encodes two post-translationally modified extracellular SCOOP10 peptides and acts upstream of SOC1 and LFY to delay flowering.",

    "abstract": "Cycling of co-substrates, whereby a metabolite is converted among alternate forms via different reactions, is ubiquitous in metabolism. Several cycled co-substrates are well known as energy and electron carriers (e.g. ATP and NAD(P)H), but there are also other metabolites that act as cycled co-substrates in different parts of central metabolism. Here, we develop a mathematical framework to analyse the effect of co-substrate cycling on metabolic flux. In the cases of a single reaction and linear pathways, we find that co-substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct to the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalysing that reaction. Using analytical methods, we show that this additional limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. Expanding from this insight and using simulations, we show that regulation of co-substrate pool size can allow regulation of flux dynamics in branched and coupled pathways. To support theses theoretical insights, we analysed existing flux measurements and enzyme levels from the central carbon metabolism and identified several reactions that could be limited by co-substrate cycling. We discuss how the limitations imposed by co-substrate cycling provide experimentally testable hypotheses on specific metabolic phenotypes. We conclude that measuring and controlling co-substrate pools is crucial for understanding and engineering the dynamics of metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The functional neurological outcome of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) strongly relates to the degree of secondary brain injury (ICH-SBI) evolving within days after the initial bleeding. Different mechanisms including the incitement of inflammatory pathways, dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), activation of resident microglia, and an influx of blood-borne immune cells, have been hypothesized to contribute to ICH-SBI. Yet, the spatiotemporal interplay of specific inflammatory processes within different brain compartments has not been sufficiently characterized, limiting potential therapeutic interventions to prevent and treat ICH-SBI. Using a whole-blood injection model in mice, we systematically characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes after ICH using 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spatial RNA sequencing (spRNAseq), functional BBB assessment, and immunofluorescence average-intensity-mapping. We identified a pronounced early response of the choroid plexus (CP) peaking at 12 to 24h, that was characterized by inflammatory cytokine expression, epithelial and endothelial expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, and the accumulation of leukocytes. In contrast, we observed a delayed secondary reaction pattern at the injection site (striatum) peaking at 96h, defined by gene expression corresponding to perilesional leukocyte infiltration and correlating to the delayed signal alteration seen on MRI. Pathway analysis revealed a dependence of the early inflammatory reaction in the CP on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). TLR4 and MyD88 knockout mice corroborated this observation, lacking the early upregulation of adhesion molecules and leukocyte infiltration within the CP 24h after whole-blood injection. In conclusion, we report a biphasic brain reaction pattern after ICH with a MyD88-TLR4-dependent early inflammatory response of the CP, preceding inflammation, edema and leukocyte infiltration at the lesion site. Pharmacological targeting of the early CP-activation might harbor the potential to modulate the development of ICH-SBI.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=83 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/506660v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@195554corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1130d16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c03678org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@381ff4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Akeret, Buzzi et al. characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics after striatal whole blood injection in mice using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spatial RNA sequencing (spRNAseq), functional blood-brain barrier (BBB) assessment, and immunofluorescence average intensity mapping (IF).

    "abstract": "Multisensory integration and recalibration are two processes by which perception deals with discrepant signals. Both are often studied in the spatial ventriloquism paradigm. There, integration is probed by the presentation of discrepant audio-visual stimuli, while recalibration manifests as an aftereffect in subsequent unisensory judgements. Both biases are typically quantified against the degree of audio-visual discrepancy, reflecting the possibility that both may arise from common underlying multisensory principles. We tested a specific prediction of this: that both processes should also scale similarly with the history of multisensory discrepancies experienced in previous trials. Analysing data from ten experiments we confirmed the expected dependency of each bias on the immediately presented discrepancy. And in line with the aftereffect being a cumulative process, this scaled with the discrepancies presented in multiple preceding audio-visual trials. However, the ventriloquism bias did not depend on the history of multisensory discrepancies and also did not depend on the aftereffect biases in previous trials - making these two multisensory processes experimentally dissociable. These findings support the notion that the ventriloquism bias and the aftereffect reflect distinct functions, with integration maintaining a stable percept by reducing immediate sensory discrepancies and recalibration maintaining an accurate percept by accounting for consistent discrepancies.",

    "abstract": "We determined the intersubject association between rhythmic entrainment abilities of human subjects during a synchronization continuation tapping task (SCT) and the macro and microstructural properties of their superficial (SWM) and deep (dWM) white matter. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained from 32 subjects who also performed the SCT with auditory or visual metronomes and five tempos ranging from 550 to 950 ms. We developed a method to determine the fiber density of U-fibers running tangentially to the cortex. Notably, the right audiomotor system showed individual differences in the density of U-fibers that were correlated with the degree of predictive entrainment across subjects. These correlations were selective for the synchronization epoch with auditory metronomes and were specific for tempos around 1.5 Hz. In addition, there was a significant association between predictive rhythmic entrainment and the density and bundle diameter of the corpus callosum (CC), forming a chronotopic map where behavioural correlations of short and long intervals were found with the anterior and posterior portions of the CC. Finally, the fiber bundle cross-section of the arcuate fasciculus, the CC, and the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus showed a significant correlation with the mean asynchronies of the auditory SCT. These findings suggest that the structural properties of the SWM and dWM in the audiomotor system support the predictive abilities of subjects during rhythmic tapping, where the density of cortical U-fibers are linked to the preferred tapping tempo, and the bundle properties of CC define an interval selective topography that has an anterior posterior gradient.",

    "abstract": "The single neuron basis of cognitive processing in primates has mostly been studied in laboratory settings where movements are severely restricted. It is unclear, therefore, how natural movements might affect neural signatures of cognition in the brain. Moreover, studies in mice indicate that body movements, when measured, account for most of the neural dynamics in the cortex. To examine this issue, we recorded from single neuron ensembles in the prefrontal cortex in moving monkeys performing a cognitive task and characterized eyes, head, and body movements using video tracking. Despite significant trial-to-trial movement variability, single neuron tuning could be precisely measured and decision signals accurately decoded on a single-trial basis. Creating or abolishing spontaneous movements through head restraint and task manipulations had no measurable impact on neural responses. However, encoding models showed that uninstructed movements explained as much neural variance as task variables, with most of them aligned to task events. These results demonstrate that cognitive signals in the cortex are robust to natural movements, but also that unmeasured movements are potential confounds in cognitive neurophysiology experiments.",

Functions of the SC have been mostly investigated in animal models, including non-human primates. Differences in the SCs anatomy and function between different species question extrapolations of these studies to humans without further validation. Few electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies in animal models and humans have reported an unexpected role of the SC in visually guided reaching movements. Using BOLD fMRI imaging, we sought to decipher if the SC is also active during reaching movements guided by tactile stimulation. Participants executed reaching movements to visual and tactile target positions. When contrasted against visual and tactile stimulation without reaching, we found increased SC activity with reaching not only for visual but also for tactile targets. We conclude that the SCs involvement in reaching does not rely on visual inputs. It is also independent from a specific sensory modality. Our results indicate a general involvement of the human SC in upper limb reaching movements.",

    "abstract": "The perforant path provides the main cortical excitatory input to the hippocampus. Due to its important role in information processing and coding, entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus have been studied in considerable detail. Nevertheless, a characterization of synaptic transmission between individual connected pairs of entorhinal stellate cells and dentate granule cells is still pending. Here, we have used organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures, in which the entorhino-dentate (EC-GC) projection is present and EC-GC pairs can be studied using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Using cultures of wildtype mice, the properties of EC-GC synapses formed by afferents from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex were compared and differences in short-term plasticity were revealed. Since the perforant path is severely affected in Alzheimers disease, we used cultures of APP-deficient mice to address the role of the amyloid-precursor protein (APP) at this synapse. APP-deficiency caused alterations in excitatory neurotransmission at medial perforant path synapses that were accompanied by transcriptomic and ultrastructural changes. Moreover, the deletion of pre- but not postsynaptic APP through the local injection of Cre-expressing AAVs in conditional APPflox/flox tissue cultures increased the efficacy of neurotransmission at perforant path synapses. Together, these data suggest a physiological role for presynaptic APP at medial perforant path synapses, which may be adversely affected under conditions of altered APP processing.",

    "abstract": "The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity (12.5-16 Hz) precisely during the slow oscillation up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops. Leveraging individualized detection of single events, we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in children aged 5 to 6, 8 to 11, and 14 to 18 years. Critically, based on this, we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age differences in their precise orchestration. While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the canonical (adult-like) fast spindle range in all three age groups - but notably less precise in children. To corroborate these findings, we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity, which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like fast spindles, and slow oscillation maturity, which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance, with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Importantly, we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and precision. Taken together, our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns across child and adolescent development.",

In a mouse model of hypertension, we found that the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction depends on IL-17, a cytokine elevated in hypertensive individuals. However, neither circulating IL-17 or brain angiotensin signaling could account in full for the dysfunction. Rather, IL-17 produced by T-cells in the dura mater was the major culprit by reaching the cerebrospinal fluid and activating IL-17 receptors on brain associated macrophages. Accordingly, depleting brain macrophages, deleting IL17-RA in brain macrophages, or suppressing meningeal T cells completely rescued cognitive function without attenuating blood pressure elevation, circulating IL-17 or brain angiotensin signaling. The data unveil a critical role of meningeal T-cells and macrophage IL-17 signaling in the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction of hypertension and suggest novel therapies to counteract the devastating effects of hypertension on cognitive health.",

    "abstract": "Phage therapy is a promising method for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections. However, its long-term efficacy depends on understanding the evolutionary effects of the treatment. Current knowledge of such evolutionary effects is lacking, even in well-studied systems. We used the bacterium Escherichia coli C and its bacteriophage {Phi}X174, which infects cells using host lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules. We first generated 31 bacterial mutants resistant to {Phi}X174 infection. Based on the genes disrupted by these mutations, we predicted that these E. coli C mutants collectively produce eight unique LPS structures. We then developed a series of evolution experiments to select for {Phi}X174 mutants capable of infecting the resistant strains. During phage adaptation, we distinguished two types of phage resistance: one that was easily overcome by {Phi}X174 with few mutational steps (\"easy\" resistance), and one that was more difficult to overcome (\"hard\" resistance). We found that increasing the diversity of the host and phage populations could accelerate the adaptation of phage {Phi}X174 to overcome the hard resistance phenotype. From these experiments, we isolated 16 {Phi}X174 mutants that, together, can infect all 31 initially resistant E. coli C mutants. Upon determining the infectivity profiles of these 16 evolved phages, we uncovered 14 distinct profiles. Given that only eight profiles are anticipated if the LPS predictions are correct, our findings highlight that the current understanding of LPS biology is insufficient to accurately forecast the evolutionary outcomes of bacterial populations infected by phage.",

    "abstract": "Admixture graphs are mathematical structures that describe the ancestry of populations in terms of divergence and merging (admixing) of ancestral populations as a graph. An admixture graph consists of a graph topology, branch lengths, and admixture proportions. The branch lengths and admixture proportions can be estimated using numerous numerical optimization methods, but inferring the topology involves a combinatorial search for which no polynomial algorithm is known. In this paper, we present a reversible jump MCMC algorithm for sampling high-probability admixture graphs and show that this approach works well both as a heuristic search for a single best-fitting graph and for summarizing shared features extracted from posterior samples of graphs. We apply the method to 11 Native American and Siberian populations and exploit the shared structure of high-probability graphs to address the relationship between Saqqaq, Inuit, Koryaks, and Athabascans. Our analyses show that the Saqqaq is not a good proxy for the previously identified gene flow from Arctic people into the Na-Dene speaking Athabascans.\n\nAuthor SummaryOne way of summarizing historical relationships between genetic samples is by constructing an admixture graph. An admixture graph describes the demographic history of a set of populations as a directed acyclic graph representing population splits and mergers. The inference of admixture graphs is currently done via greedy search algorithms that may fail to find the global optimum. We here improve on these approaches by developing a novel MCMC sampling method, AdmixtureBayes, that can sample from the posterior distribution of admixture graphs. This enables an efficient search of the entire state space as well as the ability to report a level of confidence in the sampled graphs. We apply AdmixtureBayes to a set of Native American and Arctic genomes to reconstruct the demographic history of these populations and report posterior probabilities of specific admixture events. While some previous studies have identified the ancient Saqqaq culture as a source of introgression into Athabascans, we instead find that it is the Siberian Koryak population, not the Saqqaq, that serves as the best proxy for gene flow into Athabascans.",

While these encyrtid wasps are supposed to be distributed worldwide, only few studies report about its actual appearance patterns around the globe. Within a shotgun sequencing based metagenome analysis, the occurrence of I. hookeri was screened at multiple Ixodes ricinus (Acari: Ixodidae) tick sampling points of Hungary, to contribute to the assessment of the appearance patterns of the parasitoid wasps in Central Europe. To our knowledge, the first report of the species in Hungary and the description of the southernmost I. hookeri associated geoposition in Central Europe took place within our study. I. hookeri infested I. ricinus nymphs were detected at five sampling points of Hungary. The results show that the exact distribution range of I. hookeri is still barely studied. At the same time, unprecedented public health issues being brought by climate change might require steps towards the exploitation of the tick biocontrol potential or ecological bioindicator role of the parasitoid wasp in the future.",

    "abstract": "Intradermal delivery of self-replicating RNA (srRNA) is a promising vaccine platform. Considering that human skin temperature is around 33{degrees}C, lower than core body temperature of 37{degrees}C, we have developed an srRNA that functions optimally at skin temperature and is inactivated at or above 37{degrees}C as a safety switch. This temperature-controllable srRNA (c-srRNA), when tested as an intradermal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, functions when injected naked without lipid nanoparticles. Unlike most currently available vaccines, c-srRNA vaccines predominantly elicit cellular immunity with little or no antibody production. Interestingly, c-srRNA-vaccinated mice produced antigen-specific antibodies upon subsequent stimulation with antigen protein. Antigen-specific antibodies were also produced when B-cell stimulation using antigen protein was followed by c-srRNA booster vaccination. Using c-srRNA, we have designed a pan-coronavirus booster vaccine that incorporates both spike receptor binding domains as viral surface proteins and evolutionarily conserved nucleoproteins as viral non-surface proteins, from both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. It can thereby potentially immunize against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their variants. c-srRNA may provide a route to activate cellular immunity against a wide variety of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings in permanent cell lines suggested that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 induces a stronger interferon response than Delta. Here, we show that BA.1 and BA.5 but not Delta induce an antiviral state in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and primary human monocytes. Both Omicron subvariants caused the production of biologically active type I (/{beta}) and III ({lambda}) interferons and protected cells from super-infection with influenza A viruses. Notably, abortive Omicron infection of monocytes was sufficient to protect monocytes from influenza A virus infection. Interestingly, while influenza-like illnesses surged during the Delta wave in England, their spread rapidly declined upon the emergence of Omicron. Mechanistically, Omicron-induced interferon signalling was mediated via double-stranded RNA recognition by MDA5, as MDA5 knock-out prevented it. The JAK/ STAT inhibitor baricitinib inhibited the Omicron-mediated antiviral response, suggesting it is caused by MDA5-mediated interferon production, which activates interferon receptors that then trigger JAK/ STAT signalling. In conclusion, our study 1) demonstrates that only Omicron but not Delta induces a substantial interferon response in physiologically relevant models, 2) shows that Omicron infection protects cells from influenza A virus super-infection, and 3) indicates that BA.1 and BA.5 induce comparable antiviral states.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics enter the environment through waste streams, where they can exert selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. However, many antibiotics are excreted as partly metabolized forms, or can be subject to partial breakdown in wastewater treatment, soil, or through natural processes in the environment. If a metabolite is bioactive, even at sub-lethal levels, and also stable in the environment, then it could provide selection pressure for resistance. (5S)-penicilloic acid of piperacillin has previously been found complexed to the binding pocket of penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we predicted the affinities of all potentially relevant antibiotic metabolites of ten different penicillins to that target protein, using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Docking predicts that, in addition to penicilloic acid, pseudopenicillin derivatives of these penicillins, as well as 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6APA), could also bind to this target. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed that (5R)-pseudopenicillin and 6APA bind the target protein, in addition to (5S)-penicilloic acid. Thus, it is possible that these metabolites are bioactive, and, if stable in the environment, could be contaminants selective for antibiotic resistance. This could have considerable significance for environmental surveillance for antibiotics as a means to reduce antimicrobial resistance, because targeted mass spectrometry could be required for relevant metabolites as well as the native antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.4.6, BA.4.7, and BA.5.9 have recently emerged, and BA.4.6 appears to be expanding even in the presence of BA.5 that is globally dominant. Compared to BA.5, these new subvariants harbor a mutation at R346 residue in the spike glycoprotein, raising concerns for further antibody evasion. We compared the viral receptor binding affinity of the new Omicron subvariants with BA.5 by surface plasmon resonance. We also performed VSV-based pseudovirus neutralization assays to evaluate their antigenic properties using sera from individuals who received three doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (boosted) and patients with BA.1 or BA.2 breakthrough infection, as well as using a panel of 23 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Compared to the BA.5 subvariant, BA.4.6, BA.4.7, and BA.5.9 showed similar binding affinities to hACE2 and exhibited similar resistance profiles to boosted and BA.1 breakthrough sera, but BA.4.6 was slightly but significantly more resistant than BA.5 to BA.2 breakthrough sera. Moreover, BA.4.6, BA.4.7, and BA.5.9 showed heightened resistance over to a class of mAbs due to R346T/S/I mutation. Notably, the authorized combination of tixagevimab and cilgavimab completely lost neutralizing activity against these three subvariants. The loss of activity of tixagevimab and cilgavimab against BA.4.6 leaves us with bebtelovimab as the only therapeutic mAb that has retained potent activity against all circulating forms of SARS-CoV-2. As the virus continues to evolve, our arsenal of authorized mAbs may soon be depleted, thereby jeopardizing the wellbeing of millions of immunocompromised persons who cannot robustly respond to COVID-19 vaccines.",

    "abstract": "RNA-protein interactions broadly regulate gene expression. To understand RNA regulation, it is critical to measure RNA-protein interactions in cells. Current approaches to measure RNA-protein interactions often rely on crosslinking and shortread RNA sequencing, which has considerably advanced the understanding of gene expression but also suffers from some limitations. We present REMORA (RNA Encoded Molecular Recording in Adenosines), a new strategy to measure RNA-binding events on single RNA molecules in cells. In REMORA, adenosine deamination serves as a molecular record of RNA-protein interactions that are identified by mutations by sequencing. We performed RNA-based directed evolution to identify an RNA deaminase variant with high activity on arbitrary adenosine residues in RNA. We show that this RNA deaminase has high activity, low local sequence or structure bias, low background, and is generally applicable to diverse RNA-binding proteins. By combining our improved A-to-I RNA deaminase with the C-to-U deaminase APOBEC1 and long-read RNA sequencing, our approach enables simultaneous recording of the locations two RNA binding proteins on single mRNA molecules. Orthogonal RNA molecular recording of two Pumilio family proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, reveals that PUM1 competes with PUM2 for some but not all Pumilio binding sites in cells, despite having the same in vitro binding preferences. Our work thus measures competition between RNA-binding proteins for RNA sites in cells, and our genetically encodable RNA deaminase enables single-molecule identification of RNA-protein interactions with cell type specificity.",

Gene expression provides a potential link between genotype and phenotype with growing interest in the influence of mutation on expression expanding our understanding of evolutionary changes and disease. Yet, the total amount of expression variation created by mutations; the aspects of buffering in the regulatory network or specific genes against mutation; and the fitness consequences of mutational changes to expression remain relatively unexplored. Here, we investigate the effects of >2600 de novo mutations on gene expression across the transcriptomes of 28 mutation accumulation lines derived from two independent wild-type genotypes of the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We found a much larger number of differentially expressed genes than mutations implying large effect trans-acting mutations, but also show evidence for some smaller effect cis-acting mutations. The larger influence of trans-acting mutations likely eliminated any correlation between the number of mutations and the extent of expression divergence in each line. We also found that the per generation increase in expression variance is substantially higher in C. reinhardtii than other species, which is in part due to the lower number of mutations per generation seen in unicellular organisms. Finally, we also demonstrate that the extent of expression divergence negatively correlates with overall fitness, providing direct evidence of stabilizing selection on gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The inaccessibility of human cardiomyocytes significantly hindered years of cardiovascular research efforts. Post-mortem tissue or biopsies from diseased patients, which remain scarcely available, rendered it possible to study end-stage heart disease yet the inclusion of healthy human cardiac materials for basic science research was beyond reach. To overcome these limitations, non-human cell sources were used as proxies to study heart function and associated diseases.

    "abstract": "Puromycin is an amino nucleoside that inhibits protein synthesis by interrupting elongation of nascent peptide chains. It is a commonly used selection antibiotic in molecular biology research via engineered expression of a puromycin resistance transgene. The enzyme puromycin acetyl transferase (pac) or PuroR inactivates puromycin by N-acetylating its reactive amino group. Puromycin acetylation by pac requires the central metabolite and acetyl group donor acetyl-CoA as a substrate. We found that puromycin treatment exacerbates sensitivity of cancer cells to knockdown of pantothenate kinases, the proteins that catalyze the rate-limiting step of de novo coenzyme A production in cells. Mechanistically, we found that ablation of PANKs together with puromycin depletes acetyl-CoA levels, in a manner modulated by the dose of puromycin. Our findings provide a note of caution and context in the use of puromycin for metabolism research in that interference with the major acyl donor used for inactivating biotransformation may exacerbate toxicity under selection. Broadly, our findings also invite studies to explore how targeting CoA and acetyl-CoA synthesis may be exploited to enhance cytotoxic effects of cancer drugs that undergo acetylation.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) protein in breast cancer patients is a predictor of poor prognosis and resistance to therapies. Despite significant advances in the development of targeted therapies and improvements in the 5-year survival rate of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients, a better understanding of the disease at an early stage is needed to prevent its progression. Here, we used an inducible breast cancer transformation system that allows investigation of early molecular changes at high temporal resolution. HER2 overexpression to similar levels as those observed in a subtype of HER2 positive breast cancer patients induced transformation of MCF10A cells and resulted in gross morphological changes, increased anchorage-independent growth of cells, and altered transcriptional programme of genes associated with oncogenic transformation. Global phosphoproteomic analysis during the first few hours of HER2 induction predominantly detected an increase in protein phosphorylation. Intriguingly, this correlated with a wave of chromatin opening, as measured by ATAC-seq on acini isolated from 3D cell culture. We observed that HER2 overexpression leads to reprogramming of many distal regulatory regions and promotes reprogramming-associated heterogeneity. We found that a subset of cells acquired a dedifferentiated breast stem-like phenotype, making them likely candidates for malignant transformation. Our data show that this population of cells, which counterintuitively enriches for relatively low HER2 protein abundance and increased chromatin accessibility, possesses transformational drive, resulting in increased anchorage-independent growth in vitro compared to cells not displaying a stem-like phenotype. Our data provide a discovery platform for signalling to chromatin pathways in HER2-driven cancers, offering an opportunity for biomarker discovery and identification of novel drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Novel strategies are needed to combat multidrug resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We applied genomic approaches to understand mechanisms of resistance in order to better inform treatment and precision medicine. Altered function of chromatin remodeling complexes contribute to chemoresistance. Our study generates and analyzes genomic and biochemical data from PDAC cells overexpressing HDAC1, a histone deacetylase involved in several chromatin remodeling complexes. We characterized the impact of overexpression on drug response, gene expression, HDAC1 binding, and chromatin structure using RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing for HDAC1 and H3K27 acetylation. Integrative genomic analysis shows that HDAC1 overexpression promotes activation of key resistance pathways including epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cell cycle, and apoptosis through global chromatin remodeling. Target genes are similarly altered in patient tissues and show correlation with patient survival. We also demonstrate that direct targets of HDAC1 that also show altered chromatin are enriched near genes associated with altered GTPase activity. HDAC1 target genes identified using in vitro methods and observed in patient tissues were used to develop a clinically relevant nine-transcript signature associated with patient prognosis. Integration of multiple genomic and biochemical data types enables understanding of multidrug resistance and tumorigenesis in PDAC, a disease in desperate need of novel treatment strategies.",

Mice lacking the integrated stress response (ISR) induced eIF2 phosphatase, PPP1R15A, exhibit a dilated cardiomyopathy and severe weight loss following irradiation, whilst wildtype mice are unaffected. This is associated with increased expression of Gdf15 in the heart and increased levels of GDF15 in the circulation. We provide evidence that blockade of GDF15 activity prevents cachexia and slows the progression of heart failure. Our data suggests that cardiac stress mediates a GDF15 dependent pathway that drives weight loss and worsens cardiac function. We show relevance of GDF15 to lean mass and protein intake with patients with heart failure. Blockade of GDF15 could constitute a novel therapeutic option to limit cardiac cachexia and improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe systolic heart failure.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of cortical circuits involves the generation and migration of cortical interneurons from the ventral to the dorsal forebrain, which has been challenging to study in humans as these processes take place at inaccessible stages of late gestation and early postnatal development. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have been associated with abnormal cortical interneuron development, but which of the hundreds of NDD genes impact interneuron generation and migration into circuits and how they mediate these effects remain unknown. We previously developed a stem cell-based platform to study human cortical interneurons in self-organizing organoids resembling the ventral forebrain and their migration using forebrain assembloids. Here, we integrate assembloid technology with CRISPR screening to systematically investigate the involvement of 425 NDD genes in human interneuron development. The first screen aimed at interneuron generation revealed 13 candidate genes, including the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 and the canonical TGF{beta} signaling activator SMAD4. Then, we ran an interneuron migration screen in [~]1,000 forebrain assembloids that identified 33 candidate genes, including cytoskeleton-related genes and, notably, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related gene LNPK. Interestingly, we discovered that, during interneuron migration, the ER is displaced along the leading neuronal branch prior to nuclear translocation. Deletion of LNPK interfered with this ER displacement and resulted in reduced interneuron saltation length, indicating a critical role for the ER in this migratory process. Taken together, these results highlight how this versatile CRISPR-assembloid platform can be used to systematically map disease genes onto early stages of human neural development and to reveal novel mechanisms regulating interneuron development.",

    "abstract": "Both COVID-19 mRNA or recombinant Adenovirus vector (rAdVV) based vaccines have shown a great efficacy in generating humoral and cellular immune responses. Two doses of the COVID-19 vaccines generate enough antibodies and generate spike-specific T cell responses. However, after 6-8 months there is a decline in antibody production and T cell responses. Due to the rise of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, a third or even fourth dose of vaccine was recommended for the elderly, immune comprised and frontline medical health care workers. However, despite additional booster doses given, those who were infected with either delta or omicron (during December 2021 - March 2022) had symptoms of illness. By what means these COVID-19 vaccines provide immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the molecular level is not explored extensively yet and, it is an emerging research field as to how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to evade the host immunity. Most of the infected people had mild symptoms whilst some were asymptomatic. Many of the people had developed nucleocapsid antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 delta/omicron variants confirming a humoral immune response against viral infection. Furthermore, cellular analysis shows that post-vaccinated recovered COVID-19 individuals have significantly reduced NK cells and increased T naive CD4+, TEM CD8+ and B cells. This decrease in cellular immunity corresponds to individuals who recovered from alpha variants infection and had mild symptoms. Our results highlight that booster doses clearly reduce the severity of infection against delta/omicron infection. Furthermore, our cellular and humoral immune system is trained by vaccines and ready to deal with breakthrough infections in the future.",

    "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential bacterial architecture pivotal for shape maintenance and adaptation to osmotic stress. Although PG synthesis and modification are tightly regulated under harsh environmental stresses, few related mechanisms have been investigated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the coordinated and distinct roles of the PG carboxypeptidases DacC and DacA, in adaptation to alkaline and salt stresses and shape maintenance in Escherichia coli. We found that DacC is an alkaline PG carboxypeptidase, whose enzyme activity and protein stability are significantly enhanced under alkaline stress. Both DacC and DacA were required for bacterial growth under alkaline stress, whereas only DacA was required for the adaptation to salt stress. Under normal growth conditions, only DacA was necessary for cell shape maintenance, while under alkaline stress conditions, both DacA and DacC were necessary for cell shape maintenance, but their roles were distinct. Notably, all these roles of DacC and DacA were independent of LD-transpeptidases, which are necessary for the formation of PG 3-3 crosslinks and covalent bonds between PG and the outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp. Instead, DacC and DacA interacted with penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), DD-transpeptidases, mostly in a C-terminal domain-dependent manner, and these interactions were necessary for most of their roles. Collectively, our results demonstrate the coordinated and distinct novel roles of PG carboxypeptidases in stress adaptation and shape maintenance and provide novel insights into the cellular functions of PG carboxypeptidases associated with PBPs.",

    "abstract": "In natural environments, nutrients are usually scarce causing microorganisms to grow slow while staying metabolically active. These natural conditions can be simulated using retentostat cultivations. The present study describes the physiological and proteome adaptations of the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve NRBB57 from high (0.4 h-1) to near-zero growth rates. Lactose-limited retentostat cultivations were carried out for 21 days in which the bacterial growth rate progressively reduced to 0.00092 h-1, leading to a 3.4-fold reduction of the maintenance energy requirement. Lactose was mainly converted into acetate, formate and ethanol at high growth rates while in the retentostat lactate production increased. Interestingly, the consumption of several amino acids (serine, aspartic acid and glutamine/arginine) and glycerol increased over time in the retentostat. Morphological changes and viable but non-culturable cells were also observed in the retentostat. Proteomes were compared for all growth rates, revealing a down-regulation of ribosomal proteins at near-zero growth rates and an up-regulation of proteins involved in the catabolism of alternative energy sources. Finally, we observed induction of the stringent response and stress defence systems. Retentostat cultivations were proven useful to study the physiology of B. breve, mimicking the nutrient scarcity of its complex habitat, the human gut.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn natural environments, nutrients are usually scarce causing microorganisms to grow slow while staying metabolically active. In this study we used retentostat cultivation to investigate how the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve adapts its physiology and proteome under severe nutrient limitation resulting in near-zero growth rates (<0.001 h-1). We showed that the nutrient limitation induced a multifaceted response including stress defence and stringent response, metabolic shifts and the activation of novel alternative energy producing pathways.",

    "abstract": "DNA conjugation is a contact-dependent horizontal gene transfer mechanism responsible for disseminating drug resistance among bacterial species. Conjugation remains poorly characterised at the cellular scale, particularly regarding the reactions occurring after the plasmid enters the new host cell. Here, we use live-cell microscopy to visualise the intracellular dynamics of conjugation in real time. We reveal that the transfer of the plasmid in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) form followed by its conversion into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are fast and efficient processes that occur with specific timing and subcellular localisation. Notably, the ss-to-dsDNA conversion is the critical step that governs the timing of plasmid-encoded protein production. The leading region that first enters the recipient cell carries single-stranded promoters that allow the early and transient synthesis of leading proteins immediately upon entry of the ssDNA plasmid. The subsequent ss-to-dsDNA conversion turns off leading gene expression and licences the expression of the other plasmid genes under the control of conventional double-stranded promoters. This elegant molecular strategy evolved by the conjugative plasmid allows for the timely production of factors sequentially involved in establishing, maintaining and disseminating the plasmid.",

Here, we overcome these limitations by developing TRIBE-STAMP, an approach for single-molecule detection of the target RNAs of two RNA binding proteins simultaneously in cells. We apply TRIBE-STAMP to the cytoplasmic m6A reader proteins YTHDF1, 2, and 3 and discover that individual mRNA molecules can be bound by more than one YTHDF protein throughout their lifetime, providing new insights into the function of YTHDF proteins in cells. TRIBE-STAMP is a highly versatile approach that enables single-molecule analysis of the targets of RBP pairs simultaneously in the same cells.",

Following heterologous prime-boost regimes, animals present comparable neutralizing antibody levels and superior protection across all VOCs. Single-boost only generated ancestral and omicron dual-responsive antibodies, probably by \"recall\" and \"reshape\" the prime immunity.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNAseq has allowed unprecedented insight into gene expression across different cell populations in normal tissue and disease states. However, almost all studies rely on annotated gene sets to capture gene expression levels and sequencing reads that do not align to known genes are discarded. Here, we discover thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expressed in human mammary epithelial cells and analyze their expression in individual cells of the normal breast. We show that lncRNA expression alone can discriminate between luminal and basal cell types and define subpopulations of both compartments. Clustering cells based on lncRNA expression identified additional basal subpopulations, compared to clustering based on annotated gene expression, suggesting that lncRNAs can provide an additional layer of information to better distinguish breast cell subpopulations. In contrast, these breast-specific lncRNAs poorly distinguish brain cell populations, highlighting the need to annotate tissue-specific lncRNAs prior to expression analyses. We also identified a panel of 100 breast lncRNAs that could discern breast cancer subtypes better than protein-coding markers. Overall, our results suggest that lncRNAs are an unexplored resource for new biomarker and therapeutic target discovery in the normal breast and breast cancer subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a risk factor for disease via increased susceptibility to infection, decreased ability to maintain homeostasis, inefficiency in combatting stress, and decreased regenerative capacity. Multiple diseases including urinary tract infection (UTI), are more prevalent with age; however, the mechanisms underlying how aging affects the urinary tract mucosa and the reason why aging correlates with disease are poorly understood. Here, we show that, relative to young (8-12 weeks) mice, the urothelium of aged (18-24 months) female mice accumulates large lysosomes with decreased acid phosphatase activity and shows overall decreased autophagic flux. Aged bladders exhibit basally high accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and dampened redox response. Furthermore, the aged urothelium exhibits a canonical senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) at baseline with continuous NLRP3-inflammasome- and Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptotic cell death. Accordingly, we find that aged mice chronically exfoliate epithelial cells. When infected with uropathogenic E. coli, infected aged mice harbor more bacterial reservoirs post-infection and are prone to spontaneous recurrent UTI. Finally, treatment of aged mice with D-Mannose, a natural bioactive monosaccharide, rescues autophagy flux, reverses SASP, and limits pyroptotic epithelial shedding. Thus, normal aging dramatically affects bladder physiology with aging alone increasing baseline cellular stress and susceptibility to infection. Additionally, our results suggest that mannose supplementation could serve as a senotherapeutic to limit age-associated urothelial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Despite tremendous advances in genome editing technologies, generation of conditional alleles in mice has remained challenging. Recent studies in cells have successfully made use of short artificial introns to engineer conditional alleles. The approach consists of inserting intronic sequences flanked by two loxP sites within an exon of a gene using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Under normal conditions, the artificial intron is removed by the splicing machinery, allowing for expression of the gene product. Following Cre-mediated recombination of the two loxP sites, the intron is disabled, and splicing can no longer occur. The remaining intronic sequences create a frameshift and early translational termination. Here we describe the application of this technology to engineer conditional alleles in mice using Scyl1 as a model gene. Insertion of the cassette occurred in 17% of edited mice obtained from pronuclear stage zygote microinjection. Mice homozygous for the insertion expressed SCYL1 at levels comparable to wild-type mice and showed no overt abnormalities associated with the loss of Scyl1 function, indicating the proper removal of the artificial intron. Deletion of the cassette via Cre-mediated recombination in vivo occurred at high frequency, abrogated SCYL1 protein expression, and resulted in loss-of-function phenotypes. Our results broaden the applicability of this approach to engineering conditional alleles in mice.",

    "abstract": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common muscular dystrophy. It is caused by the excessive expansion of non-coding CTG repeat, which when transcribed affect functions of RNA-binding factors. Specifically, MBNL1 is sequestered in nuclear foci while CELF1 is stabilised, with adverse effects on alternative splicing, processing and stability of a large set of muscular and cardiac transcripts. Among these effects, inefficient processing and down-regulation of muscle- and heart-specific miRNA, miR-1, has been reported in DM1 patients, but the impact of reduced miR-1 on DM1 pathogenesis was unknown. Here, we used Drosophila DM1 models to explore miR-1 involvement in cardiac dysfunction in DM1. We found that miR-1 down-regulation in the heart led to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a DM1-associated phenotype. We then combined in silico screening for miR-1 targets with transcriptional profiling of DM1 cardiac cells to identify miR-1 target genes with potential roles in DCM. We identified Multiplexin (Mp) as a new cardiac miR-1 target involved in DM1. Mp and its human ortholog Col15A1 were both highly enriched in cardiac cells of DCM-developing DM1 flies and in heart samples from DM1 patients with DCM, respectively. Importantly, when overexpressed in the heart, Mp induced DCM, whereas its attenuation ameliorated the DCM phenotype in aged DM1 flies. Reduced levels of miR-1 and consecutive up-regulation of its target Mp/Col15A1 are thus critical in DM1-associated DCM.",

    "abstract": "Mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved DNA repair pathway that safeguards the genome from errors in DNA replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two MutS homolog (Msh) complexes, Msh2-Msh3 or Msh2-Msh6, initiate MMR. Msh2-Msh3, the focus of this study, recognizes and directs repair of insertion/deletion loops (IDLs) up to ~17 nucleotides. Msh2-Msh3 also recognizes and binds distinct looped and branched DNA structures with varying affinities, thereby contributing to genome stability outside post-replicative MMR through homologous recombination, double-strand break repair (DSBR), and the DNA damage response. Msh2-Msh3 also promotes genome instability through trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. This non-canonical activity is likely an unfortunate consequence of Msh2-Msh3s intrinsic ability to bind a wide range of DNA structures, including those formed with single-stranded (ss) TNR sequences. We previously demonstrated that Msh2-Msh3 binding to 5 ssDNA flap structures interfered with the in vitro binding and cleavage activities of the flap endonuclease Rad27 (Fen1 in mammals), which promotes 5 ssDNA flap processing during Okazaki fragment maturation (OFM) and long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER). Here we demonstrate that elevated Msh2-Msh3 levels interfere with DNA replication and LP-BER in vivo, consistent with the hypothesis that protein abundance and Msh3 ATPase activities are key drivers of Msh2-Msh3-mediated genomic instability.",

However, a lack of conditional deletion alleles makes it a challenge to perform stage- or cell-specific knockout. Here, we initially applied an existing protocol to establish a floxed allele for gata2a and encountered several issues, including off-target integration and incomplete knock-in. To address these problems, we developed a protocol incorporating simultaneous co-targeting with Cas12a to insert loxP sites in cis, together with transgenic counter-screening to identify off-target insertions. We applied this protocol to establish a floxed allele of foxc1a in a single generation. We demonstrate the utility of our floxed alleles by verifying Cre-dependent deletion, which yielded expected phenotypes in each case. Finally, we used the floxed gata2a allele to demonstrate an endothelial autonomous requirement in lymphatic valve development. Together, our results provide a framework for straightforward generation and application of floxed alleles in zebrafish.",

Although SWI/SNF is highly enriched at enhancers and its basic chromatin remodeling activities have been studied for over 30 years, there is little known about how it regulates enhancer activity or enhancer-promoter interactions. We find a putative RNA binding module located near the C-terminus of the catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF required for SWI/SNF recruitment to cell-type specific enhancers and super-enhancers in naive and cell lineage primed pluripotent cells. The AT-hook is required for acquisition of the active histone marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1 and recruitment of the MLL3/4 co-activator to these enhancers and super-enhancers. Consistent with changes in enhancer architecture, loss of the AT-hook interferes with activation of genes involved in cell lineage priming as well as genes normally activated in naive pluripotent cells.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome studies disentangle functional mechanisms of gene expression regulation and may elucidate the underlying biology of disease processes. However, the types of tissues currently collected typically assay a single post-mortem timepoint or are limited to investigating cell types found in blood. Noninvasive tissues may improve disease-relevant discovery by enabling more complex longitudinal study designs, by capturing different and potentially more applicable cell types, and by increasing sample sizes due to reduced collection costs and possible higher enrollment from vulnerable populations. Here, we develop methods for sampling noninvasive biospecimens, investigate their performance across commercial and in-house library preparations, characterize their biology, and assess the feasibility of using noninvasive tissues in a multitude of transcriptomic applications. We collected buccal swabs, hair follicles, saliva, and urine cell pellets from 19 individuals over three to four timepoints, for a total of 300 unique biological samples, which we then prepared with replicates across three library preparations, for a final tally of 472 transcriptomes. Of the four tissues we studied, we found hair follicles and urine cell pellets to be most promising due to the consistency of sample quality, the cell types and expression profiles we observed, and their performance in disease-relevant applications. This is the first study to thoroughly delineate biological and technical features of noninvasive samples and demonstrate their use in a wide array of transcriptomic and clinical analyses. We anticipate future use of these biospecimens will facilitate discovery and development of clinical applications.",

However, through differential pre-mRNA splicing analysis, we discovered a cancer-enriched, non-annotated 51-nucleotide exon in TLN1 between exons 17 and 18, which we refer to as exon 17b. TLN1 is comprised of an N-terminal FERM domain, linked to 13 force-dependent switch domains, R1-R13. Inclusion of exon 17b results in an in-frame insertion of 17 amino acids immediately after Gln665 in the region between R1-R2 which lowers the force required to open the R1-R2 switches potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction. Biochemical analysis of this isoform revealed enhanced vinculin binding, and cells expressing this variant show altered adhesion dynamics. Finally, we show that the TGF-{beta}/SMAD3 signaling pathway regulates this isoform switch. Future studies will need to consider the balance of these two TLN1 isoforms.",
