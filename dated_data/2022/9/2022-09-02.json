    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genes are characterised by the presence of introns that are removed from the pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. This ribonucleoprotein complex is comprised of multiple RNA molecules and over a hundred proteins, which makes it one of the most complex molecular machines that originated during the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. Previous work has established that these introns and the spliceosomal core originated from self-splicing introns in prokaryotes. Yet it remains largely elusive how the spliceosomal core expanded by recruiting many additional proteins. In this study we use phylogenetic analyses to infer the evolutionary history of the 145 proteins that we could trace back to the spliceosome in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). We found that an overabundance of proteins derived from ribosome-related processes were added to the prokaryote-derived core. Extensive duplications of these proteins substantially increased the complexity of the emerging spliceosome. By comparing the intron positions between spliceosomal paralogs, we infer that most spliceosomal complexity postdates the spread of introns through the proto-eukaryotic genome. The reconstruction of early spliceosomal evolution provides insight into the driving forces behind the emergence of complexes with many proteins during eukaryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "There is no consensus about when a potential viral infection event presents greater risk of a successful transmission. Some authors suggest that late infection stages present higher risk of transmission. Others suggest that the early infection stages play a most relevant role in transmission events. However, studies considering the fitness or mutational effects on the viral particles over transmission events are lacking. We propose to approach this question through a two-level mathematical model based on RNA viral population dynamics. The first level of the model represents the intra-host viral population dynamics and the second level of the model represents the host-to-host dynamics of transmission events. The intra-host dynamics model uses the fitness of viral particles as means to track the presence of  highly infective particles during transmission bottlenecks. More specifically, the intra-host dynamics is described by a stochastic quasispecies, based on a multivariate branching process. The host-to-host dynamics of transmission events is emulated by a  putative transmission tree with  host zero at the root and a fixed number of branches emanating from each internal node. A  Monte Carlo strategy was adopted to explore the tree by sampling random walks along transmission chains along the tree. Viral infections of a single host and several transmission events among hosts were simulated in early and late infection stages scenarios. The results show that the early infection stages may represent a key factor in the viral pandemic. Over the evolution of the viral population within each host the mean fitness decreases due to occurrence of mutations (most of them causing deleterious effects). Despite the small opportunity interval, transmissions that occur in early stages could probably infect new hosts at a higher rate than in late stages. It was observed that a very early transmission scenario could reach a transmission chain 20 times longer than a very late transmission scenario. This indicates that the quality of the viral particles is a relevant factor for transmission events.",

Laboratory evolution data consist of protein sequences sampled from evolving populations over multiple generations and this data type does not fit into established supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. We develop a statistical learning framework that models the evolutionary process and can infer the protein fitness landscape from multiple snapshots along an evolutionary trajectory. We apply our modeling approach to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) laboratory evolution data and the resulting landscape parameters capture important aspects of DHFR structure and function. We use the resulting model to understand the structure of the fitness landscape and find numerous examples of epistasis but an overall global peak that is evolutionarily accessible from most starting sequences. Finally, we use the model to perform an in silico extrapolation of the DHFR laboratory evolution trajectory and computationally design proteins from future evolutionary rounds.",

The mutational processes driving chromosomal instability in HGSOC can be distinguished by specific copy number signatures. To develop clinically relevant models of these mutational processes we derived 15 continuous HGSOC patient-derived organoids (PDOs). We carried out detailed bulk transcriptomic, bulk genomic, single cell genomic, and drug sensitivity characterisation of the organoids. We show that PDOs comprise communities of different clonal populations and represent models of different causes of chromosomal instability including homologous recombination deficiency, chromothripsis, tandem-duplicator phenotype and whole genome duplication. We also show that these PDOs can be used as exploratory tools to study transcriptional effects of copy number alterations as well as compound-sensitivity tests. In summary, HGSOC PDO cultures provide a genomic tool for studies of specific mutational processes and precision therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of the emergent dynamics of gene regulatory networks (GRN) faces a double challenge of (a) dependence of model dynamics on parameters, and (b) lack of reliable experimentally determined parameters. In this paper we compare two complementary approaches for describing GRN dynamics across unknown parameters: (1) parameter sampling and resulting ensemble statistics used by RACIPE (RAndom CIrcuit PErturbation), and (2) use of rigorous analysis of combinatorial approximation of the ODE models by DSGRN (Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks). We find a very good agreement between RACIPE simulation and DSGRN predictions for four different 2- and 3-node networks typically observed in cellular decision making. This observation is remarkable since the DSGRN approach assumes that the Hill coefficients of the models are very high while RACIPE assumes the values in the range 1-6. Thus DSGRN parameter domains, explicitly defined by inequalities between systems parameters, are highly predictive of ODE model dynamics within a biologically reasonable range of parameters.",

    "abstract": "Inframe insertion and deletion variants (indels) alter protein sequence and length. Accurate pathogenicity predictions are important in genetic studies of human diseases. Indel Interpretation is challenging due to limitations in the available number of known pathogenic variants for training. Existing methods largely use manually encoded features including conservation, protein structure and function, and allele frequency. Recent advances in deep learning modeling of protein sequences and structures provide an opportunity to improve the representation of salient features based on large numbers of protein sequences. We developed a new pathogenicity predictor for SHort Inframe iNsertion and dEletion (SHINE). SHINE uses pre-trained protein language models to construct a latent representation of an indel and its protein context from protein sequences and multiple protein sequence alignments, and feeds the latent representation into supervised machine learning models for pathogenicity prediction. We curated training data from ClinVar and gnomAD, and created two test datasets from different sources. SHINE achieved better prediction performance than existing methods for both deletion and insertion variants in these two test datasets. Our work suggests that unsupervised protein language models can provide valuable information about proteins, and new methods based on these models can improve variant interpretation in genetic analyses.",

Several computational approaches have been developed in the past using Machine learning methods for computational drug-target association (DTA) prediction predominantly use structural data of drugs and proteins. Some of these approaches use knowledge graph networks and link prediction. To the best of our knowledge there have been no approaches that use both structural learning that offers molecular-based representations and knowledge graph-based learning which offers interaction-based representations for DTA discovery. Based on the premise that multimodal sources of information acting complimentarily could improve the robustness of DTA predictions, we developed GraMDTA, a multimodal graph neural network that learns both structural and knowledge graph representations utilizing multi-head attention to fuse the multimodal representations. We compare GraMDTA with other computational approaches for DTA prediction to demonstrate the power of multimodal fusion for discovery of DTA.",

Treatment with the selective glucocerebrosidase 2 (GBA2) inhibitor ambroxol at symptom onset significantly improved motor and gait functions in TDP-43Q331K mice. Ambroxol treatment preserved motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions which was associated with modulation of GSL metabolism. Our study establishes significant lipid dysregulation in a clinically relevant model of ALS.

    "abstract": "TDP-43 pathology is prevalent in dementia but the cell type-specific effects of TDP-43 are not clear and therapeutic strategies to alleviate TDP-43-linked cognitive decline are lacking. We found that patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have aberrant TDP-43 accumulation in hippocampal astrocytes. In mouse models, induction of widespread or hippocampus-targeted accumulation in astrocytic TDP-43 caused progressive memory loss and localized changes in antiviral gene expression. These changes were cell-autonomous and correlated with impaired astrocytic defense against infectious viruses. Among the changes, astrocytes had elevated levels of interferon-inducible chemokines and neurons had elevated levels of the corresponding chemokine receptor CXCR3 in presynaptic terminals. CXCR3 stimulation altered presynaptic function and promoted neuronal hyperexcitability, akin to the effects of astrocytic TDP-43, and blockade of CXCR3 reduced this activity. Ablation of CXCR3 also prevented TDP-43-linked memory loss. Thus, astrocytic TDP-43 dysfunction contributes to cognitive impairment through aberrant chemokine-mediated astrocytic-neuronal interactions.\n\nSummaryIn dementia, protein buildup in glia enhances chemokine signaling to synapses and impairs specific aspects of neurocognitive function.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCholesterol is essential for growth and maintenance of mammalian cells. It is stored as cholesteryl esters by the enzymes acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases 1 & 2 (ACAT 1 & 2) (Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 & 2; SOATs in GenBank). ACAT1 blockade (A1B) in macrophages ameliorates various pro-inflammatory responses elicited by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or by cholesterol loading. In mouse and human brains, Acat1 expression dominates over Acat2 and Acat1 is elevated in many neurodegenerative diseases and in acute neuroinflammation. However, the possible effects of ACAT1 blockade in neuroinflammation, regulated by mediators such as Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), has not been studied.\n\nMethodsWe conducted LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation experiments in control vs myeloid specific or neuron specific Acat1 knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, we evaluated LPS-induced neuroinflammation in the microglial cell line N9 with or without pre-treatment of the small molecule ACAT1-specific inhibitor K-604. Biochemical and microscopy assays were used to monitor inflammatory responses and the fate of TLR4.\n\nResultsIn vivo studies revealed that Acat1 inactivation in myeloid cell lineage, but not in neurons, markedly attenuated LPS-induced activation of various pro-inflammatory response genes in hippocampus and cortex. Studies in cell culture showed that pre-incubating cells with K-604 significantly ameliorated the pro-inflammatory responses induced by LPS. In cells acutely treated with LPS (for 30 min), pre-incubation with K-604 significantly increased the endocytosis of TLR4, the major transmembrane signaling receptor that mediates LPS-dependent acute neuroinflammation. In cells chronically treated with LPS (for 24-48 hrs), pre-incubation with K-604 significantly decreased the total TLR4 protein content, presumably due to enhanced trafficking of TLR4 to the lysosomes for degradation. For ex vivo evidence, we isolated microglia from adult mice, and found that in mice without LPS stimulation, myeloid Acat1 inactivation altered cellular distribution of TLR4; in mice with LPS stimulation, myeloid Acat1 inactivation decreased the cellular content of TLR4.\n\nConclusionBlocking ACAT1 in mouse microglia alters the fate of TLR4 and suppresses its ability to participate in pro-inflammatory signaling cascade in response to LPS.",

    "abstract": "The magnitude and duration of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent macrophage proinflammatory responses are tightly regulated. Chronic TLR signaling drives tolerance, an immunosuppressed state of innate immune memory. Understanding of this regulation is incomplete. Here, we demonstrate that direct Coenzyme A (CoA) supplementation both reverses tolerance, and enhances TLR-dependent macrophage proinflammatory responses. Synergizing with TLR-driven glycolysis, CoA enhances glucose entry into the mitochondrial TCA cycle, fueling acetyl-CoA and citrate biosynthesis for epigenetic activation of proinflammatory gene transcription. CoA unlocks tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-dependent TLR agonist anti-tumor activity in breast cancer, and promotes macrophage restriction of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Our findings identify CoA-dependent mitochondrial glucose utilization, and not aerobic glycolysis, as the key metabolic flux supporting TLR-dependent macrophage proinflammatory responses. Moreover, they show tolerance is a plastic state amenable to reversal by CoA, which re-routes glucose to restore requisite metabolic support of said responses, reversing myeloid immunosuppression in cancer and infection.",

    "abstract": "The utility of Active Genetic (AG) gene conversion systems in rats and mice holds great promise for facilitating the production of complex strains harboring multiple humanizing genes. The practical application of such systems requires the identification of a robust, reusable, and highly efficient system. By characterizing twenty-eight different promoter and target site pairs we aimed to define the parameters needed to establish an efficient conversion system in male and female rats and mice. Using three specific meiosis prophase I active promoters to drive Cas9 expression. We studied several variables, including the number of Cas9 target sites, the distance between target sites, the cis versus trans configuration in linked pairs, and the effect of Cas9 copy number.\n\nIn the rat, three of twelve tested configurations provided efficient AG gene conversion in the 22% - 67% range, and four others catalyzed AG in the 0.7-1% range. The rat Ddx4 (Vasa) promoter provides higher AG efficiency than the Sycp1 promoter. In mice, ten of sixteen tested configurations, using the Sycp1 and pSycp1 promoters, provided efficiency in the 0.3% - 3.2% range. In rats, Cas9 expression levels are remarkably well correlated with AG gene conversion efficiency. The rat cis rCyp3A1/rCyp3A2 locus was the most successful configuration, with gene conversion efficiencies of 0.7%-67%. This target site has a special property; the two Cas9 target sites are nearly perfectly homologous in the 100 bases around the gRNA target site.\n\nOur findings identify key parameters that improve AG efficiency, including the use of two Cas9 target sites, and efficient promoters that drive high levels of Cas9 expression that are correctly timed during gamete development. These findings also uncover the unexpected benefit of high homology at paired gRNA target sites to promote efficiency. We provide new data to guide future efforts to develop yet further improved AG systems.",

    "abstract": "We designed a behavioral task called One-Trial Trace Escape Reaction (OTTER), in which rats incidentally associate two temporally discontinuous stimuli: a neutral acoustic cue (CS) with an aversive stimulus (US) which occurs two seconds later (CS-2s-US sequence). Rats are first habituated to two similar environmental contexts (A and B), each consisting of an interconnected dark and light chamber. Next, rats experience the CS-2s-US sequence in the dark chamber of one of the contexts (either A or B); the US is terminated immediately after a rat escapes into the light chamber. The CS-2s-US sequence is presented only once to ensure the incidental acquisition of the association. The recall is tested 24 h later when rats are presented with only the CS in the alternate context (B or A), and their behavioral response is observed. Our results show that 59 % of the rats responded to the CS by escaping to the light chamber, although they experienced only one CS-2s-US pairing. The OTTER task offers a flexible high throughput tool to study memory acquired incidentally after a single experience. Incidental acquisition of association between temporally discontinuous events is highly relevant to episodic memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the causes and fitness consequences of intraspecific variation in cognitive performance is fundamental to understand how cognition evolves. Selection may act on different cognitive traits separately or jointly as part of the general cognitive performance of the individual. To date, few studies have examined simultaneously whether individual cognitive performance covaries across different cognitive tasks, the relative importance of individual and social attributes in determining cognitive variation, and its fitness consequences in the wild. Here, we tested 38 wild southern pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) on a cognitive test battery targeting associative learning, reversal learning and inhibitory control. We found that a single factor explained 59.5% of the variation in individual cognitive performance across tasks, suggestive of a general cognitive factor. General cognitive performance varied by age and sex; declining with age in females but not males. Older females also tended to produce a higher average number of fledglings per year compared to younger females. Analysing over 10 years of breeding data, we found that individuals with lower general cognitive performance produced more fledglings per year. Collectively, our findings support the existence of a trade-off between cognitive performance and reproductive success in a wild bird.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in brain metabolism are closely associated with the molecular hallmarks of Parkinsons disease (PD). A clear understanding of the main metabolic perturbations in PD is therefore important. Here, we retrospectively analysed the expression of metabolic genes from 34 PD-control post-mortem human brain transcriptome data from literature, spanning multiple brain regions, and found significant metabolic correlations between the Substantia nigra (SN) and cerebral cortical tissues with high perturbations in protein modification, transport, nucleotide and inositol phosphate metabolic pathways. Moreover, three main metabolic clusters of SN tissues were identified from patient cohort studies, each characterised by perturbations in (a) pyruvate, amino acid, neurotransmitter, and complex lipid metabolisms (b) inflammation-related metabolism, and (c) lipid breakdown for energy metabolism. Finally, we analysed 58 PD-control transcriptome data from in vivo/in vitro disease models and identified experimental PD models with significant correlations to matched human brain regions. Collectively, our findings are based on 47 PD transcriptome datasets covering 92 PD-control comparisons spanning more than 1000 samples in total, and they suggest metabolic alterations in several brain regions, heterogeneity in metabolic alterations between study cohorts for the SN tissues and suggest the need to optimize current experimental models to advance research on metabolic aspects of PD.",

Automated classification systems help avoid subjective outcomes and are more efficient. Deep learning and more specifically Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various biomedical image classification problems. However, real-world data often suffers from the data imbalance problem, owing to which the trained classifier is biased towards the majority classes and does not perform well on the minority classes. This study presents an imbalanced blood cells classification method that utilises Wasserstein divergence GAN, mixup and novel nonlinear mixup for data augmentation to achieve oversampling of the minority classes. We also present a minority class focussed sampling strategy, which allows effective representation of minority class samples produced by all three data augmentation techniques and contributes to the classification performance. The method was evaluated on two publicly available datasets of immortalised human T-lymphocyte cells and Red Blood Cells. Classification performance evaluated using F1-score shows that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods on the same datasets.",

By integrating multiplex immunohistochemistry and histopathological analysis to investigate composition and the spatial relationship between neoplastic cells, infiltrating and brain resident immune cells and the extracellular matrix, we demonstrate that metastatic brain tumors exhibit differences in ECM deposition, compared with the most common primary brain tumor type, glioblastoma, and that the dominant immune cell types in metastatic brain tumors are immunosuppressive macrophages, which preferentially localize to ECM-rich stromal regions.",

The search for new chemical scaffolds that target novel pathways of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is of highest priority.

Synthesis of a library of 94 hemi-synthetic derivatives allowed us to identify compound 84 that kills multi-drug resistant clinical isolates in the nanomolar range (median IC50 ranging from 35-88nM). Efforts were made to obtain compounds with significantly improved preclinical properties. Out of those, compound 125 delays the onset of parasitemia in P. berghei infected mice and inhibits P. falciparum transmission stages in vitro (culture assays) and in vivo using membrane feeding assay in the Anopheles stephensi vector. Compound 125 also impairs P. falciparum development in sporozoite-infected hepatocytes, in the low micromolar range. Finally, we used a chemical pull-down strategy to identify potential protein targets of this chemical family.

    "abstract": "Natriuretic peptides (NP), including atrial, brain, and C-type natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, and CNP), play essential roles in regulating blood pressure, cardiovascular homeostasis, and systemic metabolism. One of the major metabolic effects of NP is manifested by their capacity to stimulate lipolysis and the thermogenesis gene program in adipocytes, however, their metabolic effect on skeletal muscle is much less appreciated. There are three NP receptors (NPR): NPRA, NPRB, and NPRC, and all three NPR genes are expressed in C2C12 myocytes. Treatment with either ANP, BNP, or CNP evokes the cGMP signaling process in C2C12 myocytes. We then generated a genetic model with Nprc gene deletion in skeletal muscle and tested whether enhancing NP signaling by preventing its clearance in skeletal muscle would improve exercise performance in mice. Under sedentary conditions, Nprc skeletal muscle knockout (MKO) mice showed comparable exercise performance to their floxed littermates in terms of maximal running velocity and total endurance running time. Eight weeks of voluntary running-wheel training in a young cohort increased exercise performance, but no significant differences were observed in MKO compared with control mice. Furthermore, 6-weeks of treadmill training in a relatively aged cohort also increased exercise performance compared with their baseline but did not result in an improvement in MKO mice compared with the controls. In summary, our study suggests that NP signaling is potentially important in myocytes but its function in skeletal muscle in vivo needs to be further studied in alternative physiological conditions or with new genetic mouse models.",

However, for infections by Dengue, Zika or Yellow Fever virus there are no effective anti-infective drug treatments nor for Dengue or Zika virus a safe effective vaccine and prevention at present focusses on vector (mosquito) control. Whilst symptoms from Dengue, Zika and Yellow Fever virus infection may be mild for some, they are very serious and life threatening for others. For instance, severe Dengue is a leading cause of hospitalisation and death among children and adults in Asian and Latin American countries. Likewise, Zika infection can have catastrophic consequences for pregnant women following the passing of the virus to their foetus with arising miscarriage or birth defects including microcephaly that can be fatal. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of a unique low molecular weight dextran sulphate (LMW-DS) clinical stage drug, ILB(R), to inhibit infection of human cells by four serotypes of Dengue virus (DENV1-4), two strains of Zika virus (African and Asian) and Yellow Fever virus (vaccine strain YF17D) assessed by immunofluorescence of viral particles. ILB(R) potently inhibited infection by all the strains of Dengue, Zika and Yellow Fever virus in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 for ILB(R) ranging from 31 to 343 g/ml. In conclusion, given the safety profile of ILB(R) established in a number of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, these results highlight the potential of ILB(R) to treat patients infected with Dengue, Zika or Yellow Fever virus with the opportunity to translate the findings quickly by clinical investigation.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that Fc{gamma} receptor I (Fc{gamma}RI) is expressed in the neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and may be involved in chronic pain.\n\nMethodsChronic constriction injury (CCI) was used to induce neuropathic pain in rats. Primary neuron-specific Fcgr1 conditional knockout (CKO) rats were established by crossing rats carrying a Fcgr1loxP+/+ with the PirtCRE+ line. Behavioral and molecular studies were conducted to evaluate the differences between wild-type and CKO rats after CCI.\n\nResultsWe first revealed that CCI activated neuronal Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling in the DRG. CCI-induced neuropathic pain was alleviated in CKO rats. C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased in the DRG after nerve injury. Intraganglionic injection or overexpression of the recombinant CRP protein in the DRG evoked pain accompanied and activated neuronal Fc{gamma}RI. CRP-evoked pain was significantly reduced in CKO rats. Furthermore, microinjection of native IgG into the DRG alleviated neuropathic pain and the activation of neuronal Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that the activation of neuronal CRP/Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling plays an important role in the development of pain in CCI. Our findings may provide novel insights into the neuroimmune responses after peripheral nerve injury and might suggest potential therapeutic targets for neuropathic pain.",

Rank-rank hypergeometric overlap is an important threshold-free method to combine and visualize two ranked lists of P-values or fold-changes, usually from differential gene expression analyses. Here, we introduce a new rank-rank hypergeometric overlap-based method aimed at both gene level and alternative splicing analyses at transcript or exon level, hitherto unreachable as transcript numbers are an order of magnitude larger than gene numbers.\n\nResultsWe tested the tool on synthetic and real datasets at gene and transcript levels to detect correlation and anti-correlation patterns and found it to be fast and accurate, even on very large datasets thanks to an evolutionary algorithm based minimal P-value search. The tool comes with a ready-to-use permutation scheme allowing the computation of adjusted P-values at low time cost. Additionally, the package is a drop-in replacement to previous packages as a compatibility mode is included, allowing to re-run older studies with close to no change to existing pipelines.

    "abstract": "Many cancers carry change-of-function mutations affecting RNA splicing factors, however, less is known about the functional consequences of upregulated RNA splicing factors in cancer. Here, we demonstrate that SMNDC1, a poorly studied splicing factor, which we found to be upregulated in multiple carcinomas and associated with poor patient prognosis, promotes cell proliferation, clonal expansion, and tumor growth by promoting the retention of G-rich exons, which otherwise would be excluded or retained at a lower rate after RNA splicing in normal cells. Inclusion of exon 4 (E4) of MAPK3 (ERK1), which encodes both kinase phosphorylation sites (Thr202/Tyr204), was among the promoted exons by SMNDC1. Forced exclusion of MAPK3-E4 using anti-sense oligos inhibited the ERK1 phosphorylation, expression of target genes and decreased tumor cell growth. These data support that cancer cells exploit a \"splicing switch\" to promote ERK kinase activity and offer a druggable alternative to block oncogenic signaling and altered RNA splicing in cancer cells\n\nSIGNIFICANCEERK signaling promotes tumor growth and survival. Exon 4 of MAPK3 (ERK1) encodes the activation phosphorylation sites of ERK1 kinase. Aberrant RNA splicing induced by SMNDC1 in cancer cells increases the retention of exon 4 during mRNA splicing, unleashes the kinase activity. SMNDC1 potentializes as a cancer therapeutic target.",

The influence of peritumoral synaptic density, growth dynamics, and spatial contours of excess glutamate upon higher order neuronal network modularity is unknown. We combined cellular and widefield imaging of calcium and glutamate fluorescent reporters in two GBM mouse models with distinct synaptic microenvironments and growth profiles. Functional metrics of neural ensembles are dysregulated during tumor invasion depending on the stage of malignant progression and tumor cell proximity. Neural activity is significantly elevated during periods of accelerated tumor growth. Abnormal glutamate accumulation precedes and outpaces the spatial extent of baseline neuronal calcium signaling, indicating these processes are uncoupled in tumor cortex.

Here, we present results from a synthesis of acoustic telemetry data for sub-adult and adult white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) from 2010 to 2017 in the San Francisco Estuary and Sacramento River ecosystems. We focused primarily on uncovering spatial patterns of inferred habitat occupancy across life stages, and on linking habitat use to extant anthropogenic threats. We found substantial differences in habitat use across individuals and over time that was related to fish size classes defined relative to the slot limit (102-152 cm) used to regulate recreational fishing. However, differences in habitat use were not explained by fish sex or water year flow conditions. We also estimated indices of overall exposure for two major threats: capture by anglers and habitat modification. Fish of harvestable size were detected less often than others in areas where many are caught. Future monitoring and management of white sturgeon might benefit from examining multiple phases of white sturgeon life history. For example, additional tracking studies could improve our understanding of juvenile habitat use, adult survival rates, patterns of anadromy, and cross-basin habitat utilization.",

    "abstract": "Doliolids are common gelatinous grazers in marine ecosystems around the world and likely influence carbon cycling due to their large population sizes with high growth and excretion rates. Aggregations or blooms of these organisms occur frequently, but they are difficult to measure or predict because doliolids are fragile, under sampled with conventional plankton nets, and can aggregate on fine spatial scales (1-10 m). Moreover, ecological studies typically target a single region or site that does not encompass the range of possible habitats favoring doliolid proliferation. To address these limitations, we combined in situ imaging data from six coastal ecosystems, including the Oregon shelf, northern California, southern California Bight, northern Gulf of Mexico, Straits of Florida, and Mediterranean Sea, to resolve and compare doliolid habitat associations during warm months when environmental gradients are strong and doliolid blooms are frequently documented. Higher ocean temperature was the strongest predictor of elevated doliolid abundances across ecosystems, with additional variance explained by chlorophyll-a fluorescence and dissolved oxygen. For marginal seas with a wide range of productivity regimes, the nurse stage tended to comprise a higher proportion of the doliolids when total abundance was low. However, this pattern did not hold in ecosystems with persistent coastal upwelling. The doliolids tended to be most aggregated in oligotrophic systems (Mediterranean and southern California), suggesting that microhabitats within the water column favor proliferation on fine spatial scales. Similar comparative approaches can resolve the realized niche of fast-reproducing marine animals, thus improving predictions for population-level responses to changing oceanographic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic interactions have structured past and present ecosystems and shaped the evolution of life. As any trait, the symbiotic state observed in extant species builds on ancestral and conserved features, and lineage-specific innovations. From these mixed origins, defining the ancestral state of symbiotic associations is challenging although it is instrumental for understanding how symbiotic abilities emerge from non-symbiotic states. Here we aimed at reconstructing the intermediate steps leading to the root-nodule nitrogen-fixing symbiosis (RNS) observed in some extant flowering plants. For this, we compared the transcriptomic responses of nine host plants in response to symbiotic bacteria. We included the mimosoid legume Mimosa pudica for which we assembled a chromosome-level genome and generated the transcriptomic response to experimentally evolved bacterial symbionts. With this dataset, we reconstructed the ancestral RNS transcriptome, composed of most already described symbiotic genes together with hundreds of novel candidates. We found that the response to the chemical signals produced by the symbiont, nodule organogenesis and nitrogen-fixation are predominantly linked to ancestral responses, although these traits have diversified in the different nitrogen-fixing lineages. We detected a clear signature of recent and convergent evolution for the ability to release intracellular symbiosomes in two legume lineages, exemplified by the expression of different classes of small proteins in each group, potentially leading to the convergent gain of symbiotic evolutionary stability. Our findings demonstrate that most of the novelties for RNS were mostly in place in the most recent common ancestor of the RNS-forming species that lived on Earth 110 million years ago.\n\nGraphical abstractA little graphical/nice phylogeny with nodes of interest\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe sequenced a high-quality genome of the Mimosoideae Mimosa pudica\nC_LIO_LIThe nitrogen-fixing root-nodule symbiosis relies on an ancestral transcriptomic response\nC_LIO_LIAll symbiotic traits involve genes of the ancestral symbiotic program\nC_LIO_LISymbiont perception, nodule organogenesis and nitrogen-fixation are essentially ancestral processes\nC_LIO_LIConvergent evolution of intracellular accommodation of symbionts additionally involves lineage-specific genes\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genome editing and in vitro based-plant propagation require efficient plant regeneration system. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) or de novo shoot regeneration are two major systems that widely used for plant in vitro regeneration. Most SE or shoot regeneration protocols rely on the exogenous application of the synthetic auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and naphthylene acetic acid (NAA), whereas the natural auxins indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid (4-Cl-IAA) or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) are not or less effective for plant regeneration. Although these synthetic auxins mimics the physiological activity of the main natural auxin IAA in many aspects, there are also clear differences that have been attributed to differences in stability or to different affinities for certain TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA auxin co-receptor pairs. Here we show that the success of 2,4-D in inducing SE from Arabidopsis is related to ineffectiveness as substrate for auxin efflux, resulting in its intracellular 2,4-D accumulation. Reducing auxin efflux by addition of the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) also allowed natural auxins and other synthetic analogs to induce SE in Arabidopsis with similar efficiencies as 2,4-D. The PIN-FORMED auxin efflux carriers PIN1, PIN2 and the ATP-binding cassette-B auxin transporters ABCB1 and ABCB19 were shown to be partially responsible for the efflux of natural auxins during SE induction. Importantly, all somatic embryos induced in Arabidopsis by IAA in the presence of NPA showed a normal embryo to seedling conversion and subsequent plant development, whereas for the 2,4-D system this was limited to 50-60% of the embryos. We showed that the auxin transport inhibition promotes de novo shoot regeneration capacity from callus induced by 4-Cl-IAA in Brassica napus. In addition, we observed a obvious acceleration in shoot bud emerging from callus induced by 4-Cl-IAA than 2,4-D. Based on our data we conclude, that the efficiency of plant propagation can be significantly improved by applying the natural auxins in the presence of the auxin transport inhibitor NPA.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases of plants present an ongoing and increasing threat to international biosecurity, with wide-ranging implications. An important challenge in plant disease management is achieving early detection of invading pathogens in new locations, which requires effective surveillance through the implementation of appropriate monitoring programs. However, when monitoring relies on visual inspection as a means of detection, surveillance is often hindered by a long incubation period (delay from infection to symptom onset) during which plants may be infectious but not displaying visible symptoms.  Sentinel plants - alternative susceptible host species that display visible symptoms of infection more rapidly - could be introduced to at-risk populations and included in monitoring programs to act as early warning beacons for infection. However, while sentinel hosts exhibit faster disease progression and so allow pathogens to be detected earlier, this often comes at a cost: faster disease progression typically promotes earlier onward transmission. Here, we construct a computational model of pathogen transmission to explore this trade-off and investigate how including sentinel plants in monitoring programmes could facilitate earlier detection of invasive plant pathogens. Using Xylella fastidiosa infection in Olea europaea (European olive) as a current high profile case study, for which Catharanthus roseus (Madagascan periwinkle) is a candidate sentinel host, we apply a Bayesian optimisation algorithm to determine the optimal number of sentinel hosts to introduce for a given sampling effort, as well as the optimal division of limited surveillance resources between crop and sentinel plants. Our results demonstrate that including sentinel plants in monitoring programmes can reduce the expected prevalence of infection upon outbreak detection substantially, increasing the feasibility of local outbreak containment.",

    "abstract": "Plants generate organs continuously during post-embryonic development, thus how to preserve stem cells in changing environments is crucial for their survival. Genotoxic stress threatens genome stability in all somatic cells, whereas, in the meristem, only stem cells undergo cell death in response to DNA damage, followed by stem cell replenishment. It was previously shown that inhibition of downward auxin flow in roots participates in DNA damage-induced stem cell death; however, how cell death is confined to stem cells in tissues with reduced auxin content remains elusive. Here we show that, in response to DNA double-strand breaks, the Aux/IAA family members IAA5 and IAA29, which encode the negative regulators of auxin signaling, were locally induced in vascular stem cells and their daughters in Arabidopsis roots. This is an active response to DNA damage in which the transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 directly induces their expression. In the iaa5 iaa29 double mutant, DNA damage-induced stem cell death was significantly suppressed, while it was fully restored by the expression of a stable form of IAA5 in vascular stem cells. Our genetic data revealed that both the suppression of auxin signaling and reduced auxin content are prerequisite for cell death induction, suggesting the central role in maintaining genome integrity in stem cells.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThe induction of IAA5 and IAA29 promotes stem cell death in Arabidopsis roots under DNA stress.",

The combination of distinct morphogenetic factors, the maize BABY BOOM transcriptional regulator (ZmBBM/EREB53) and the wheat GRF4-GIF1 (GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR4 - GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR1) chimera, together with a modified QuickCorn protocol, regenerated transformed maize seedlings in approximately two months with an efficiency of 26 to 37%; notably, the efficiency was 7-fold higher than with using either component in isolation. Additionally, ectopic expression of both morphogenetic factors did not show obvious effects on B104 development, and in particular fertility was not affected, obviating the need to remove the morphogenetic regulators post Agrobacterium infections.

    "abstract": "Movement slowness is a common and disruptive symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). A potential cause is that individuals with MS slow down to conserve energy as a behavioral adjustment to heightened metabolic costs of movement. To investigate this prospect, we measured the metabolic costs of both walking and seated arm reaching at five speeds in persons with mild MS (pwMS; n = 13; 46.0 {+/-} 7.7yrs) and sex- and age-matched controls (HCs; n = 13; 45.8 {+/-} 7.8yrs). Notably, the cohort of pwMS was highly mobile and no individuals required a cane or aid when walking. We found that the net metabolic power of walking was approximately 20% higher for pwMS across all speeds (p = 0.0185). In contrast, we found no differences in the gross costs of reaching between pwMS and HCs (p = 0.492). Collectively, our results suggest that abnormal slowness of movement in MS - particularly reaching - is not the consequence of heightened effort costs alone. Our findings are consistent with the possibility that demyelination of reward regions of the central nervous system in MS disrupt the dopamine-mediated impetus to move more quickly and thereby prompt slower movements.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYIndividuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) often move more slowly than those without the disease. A possible cause is that movements in MS are more energetically expensive and slowing is an adaptation to conserve metabolic resources. Here, we find that while walking is more costly for persons with MS, arm reaching movements are not. These results bring into question the driving force of movement slowness in MS and implicate other motor-related networks contributing to slowing.",

    "abstract": "Evidence for hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis and thermoregulation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) during aging has been well recognized, yet the central molecular mediators involved in this process are poorly understood. The arcuate hypothalamus (ARC), orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons control nutrient intake, energy homeostasis, and BAT thermogenesis. To determine the roles of growth hormone receptor (GHR) signaling in the AgRP neurons we used mice with the AgRP-specific GHR deletion (AgRP{Delta}GHR). We found that female AgRP{Delta}GHR mice were resistant to temperature adaptation, and their body core temperature remained significantly lower when held at 10{degrees}C, 22{degrees}C, or 30{degrees}C, compared to control mice. Low body core temperature in female AgRP{Delta}GHR mice has been associated with significant reductions in Ucp1 and Pgc1 expression in the BAT. Further, neuronal activity in AgRP in response to cold exposure was blunted in AgRP{Delta}GHR females, while the number of Fos+ AgRP neurons was increased in control females exposed to cold. Global transcriptome from BAT identified increased expression of genes related to immune responses and chemokine activity and decreased expression of genes involved in triglycerides synthesis and metabolic pathways in AgRP{Delta}GHR females. Importantly, these were the same genes that are downregulated by thermoneutrality in control mice but not in the AgRP{Delta}GHR animals. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel circuit of thermal regulation between the hypothalamic AgRP-GHR and BAT and provide insight into the brain systems that are critical for the thermogenic vitality of the elderly.",

It suppresses the integrated stress response (ISR), purportedly by interacting with stress granule (SG) assembly factors G3BP1 and 2, and inhibits type I interferon responses. To elucidate its mode of action, we systematically deleted and over-expressed distinct regions and domains. We show that N via domain N2b blocks PKR-mediated ISR activation, as measured by suppression of ISR-induced translational arrest and SG formation. N2b mutations that prevent dsRNA binding abrogate these activities also when introduced in the intact N protein. Substitutions reported to block post-translation modifications of N or its interaction with G3BP1/2 did not have a detectable additive effect. In an encephalomyocarditis virus-based infection model, N2b - but not a derivative defective in RNA binding - prevented PKR activation, inhibited {beta}-interferon expression and promoted virus replication. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 N inhibits innate immunity by sequestering dsRNA to prevent activation of PKR and RIG-I-like receptors. Similar observations were made for the N protein of human coronavirus 229E, suggesting that this may be a general trait conserved among members of other orthocoronavirus (sub)genera.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N is an antagonist of innate immunity but how it averts virus detection by intracellular sensors remains subject to debate. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 N, by sequestering dsRNA through domain N2b, prevents PKR-mediated activation of the integrated stress response as well as detection by RIG-I-like receptors and ensuing type I interferon expression. This function, conserved in human coronavirus 229E, is not affected by mutations that prevent posttranslational modifications, previously implicated in immune evasion, or that target its binding to stress granule scaffold proteins. Our findings further our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immunity, how this may drive viral evolution and why increased N expression may have been a selective advantage to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",

    "abstract": "The spillover of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from humans into white-tailed deer (WTD) and its ability to transmit from deer-to-deer raised concerns about the role of WTD in the epidemiology and ecology of the virus. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation to assess the prevalence, genetic diversity, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD in the State of New York (NY). A total of 5,462 retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) samples collected from free-ranging hunter-harvested WTD during the hunting seasons of 2020 (Season 1, September-December 2020, n=2,700) and 2021 (Season 2, September-December 2021, n=2,762) were tested by SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 17 samples (0.6%) from Season 1 and in 583 (21.1%) samples from Season 2. Hotspots of infection were identified in multiple confined geographic areas of NY. Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 164 samples demonstrated the presence multipls SARS-CoV-2 lineages as well as the co-circulation of three major variants of concern (VOCs) (Alpha, Gamma, and Delta) in WTD. Our analysis suggests the occurrence of multiple spillover events (human-to-deer) of the Alpha and Delta lineages with subsequent deer-to-deer transmission of the viruses. Detection of Alpha and Gamma variants in WTD long after their broad circulation in humans in NY suggests that WTD may serve as a wildlife reservoir for VOCs no longer circulating in humans. Thus, implementation of continuous surveillance programs to monitor SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in WTD are warranted, and measures to minimize virus transmission between humans and animals are urgently needed.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWhite-tailed deer (WTD) are highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and are known to efficiently transmit the virus to other susceptible animals. Evidence of natural exposure or infection of wild WTD in North America raised significant concerns about their role on the ecology of the virus and its impact on the control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This comprehensive study demonstrates widespread infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the WTD populations across the State of New York. Additionally, we showed co-circulation of three major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) in this wildlife population, long after their broad circulation in humans. These findings indicate that WTD - the most abundant large mammal in North America - may serve as a reservoir for variant SARS-CoV-2 strains that no longer circulate in the human population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBecause circulating DNA (cirDNA) are mainly detected as mononucleosome-associated circulating DNA (mono-N cirDNA) in blood apoptosis has until now been considered as the main source of cirDNA. The mechanism of cirDNA release into the circulation, however, is still not fully understood. This work addresses that knowledge gap, working from the postulate that neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) may be a source of cirDNA, and by investigating whether NET may directly produce mono-N cirDNA\n\nMethodsWe used the synergistic analytical information provided by specifically quantifying DNA by qPCR, and analyzing fragment size analysis by shallow WGS, and capillary electrophoresis to unequivocally study the following: the in vitro kinetics of cell derived genomic high molecular weight (gHMW) DNA degradation in serum; the production of extracellular DNA and NET markers such as neutrophil elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) by ex vivo activated neutrophils; in vitro NET degradation in serum. We also performed an in vivo study in knockout mice, and an in vitro study of gHMW DNA degradation, to elucidate the role of NE and MPO in effecting DNA degradation and fragmentation. We then compared the NET associated markers and fragmentation size profiles of cirDNA in plasma obtained from patients with inflammatory diseases found to be associated with NET formation and high levels of cirDNA (COVID-19, N= 28; systemic lupus erythematosus, N= 10; metastatic colorectal cancer, N= 10; and from healthy individuals, N= 114).\n\nResultsOur studies reveal that: gHMW DNA degradation in serum results in the accumulation of mono-N DNA (81.3% of the remaining DNA following 24H incubation in serum corresponded to mono-N DNA); \"ex vivo\" NET formation, as demonstrated by a concurrent 5-, 5- and 35-fold increase of NE, MPO, and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentration in PMA-activated neutrophil culture supernatant, leads to the release of high molecular weight DNA that degrades down to mono-N in serum; NET mainly in the form of gHMW DNA generate mono-N cirDNA (2% and 41% of the remaining DNA after 2 hours in serum corresponded to 1-10 kbp fragments and mono-N, respectively) independent of any cellular process when degraded in serum; NE and MPO may contribute synergistically to NET autocatabolism, resulting in a 25-fold decrease in total DNA concentration and a DNA fragment size profile similar to that observed from cirDNA following 8h incubation with both NE and MPO; the cirDNA size profile of NE KO mice significantly differed from that of the WT, suggesting NE involvement in DNA degradation; and a significant increase in the levels of NE, MPO and cirDNA was detected in plasma samples from lupus, COVID-19 and mCRC, showing a high correlation with these inflammatory diseases, while no correlation of NE and MPO with cirDNA was found in HI.\n\nConclusionsOur work thus describes the mechanisms by which NET and cirDNA are linked, by demonstrating that NET are a major source of mono-N cirDNA independent of apoptosis, and thus establishing a new paradigm of the mechanisms of cirDNA release in normal and pathological conditions, as well as demonstrating a link between immune response and cirDNA.",

All sequences were publicly available on the Platform of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and were analyzed for their Molecular Variance (AMOVA), haplotypic diversity, mismatch, demographic and spatial expansion, molecular diversity and time of evolutionary divergence. The results suggested that there was a high diversity among haplotypes, with high numbers of transitions, transversions and mutations of the indels type for 5 of the 8 groups analyzed and with slight population expansion perceived in the neutrality tests. The estimators used in this study did not support a uniformity among all the results found, which ensures the lack of conservation of the gene, as well as its protein product, a fact that stimulates the use of therapies based on neutralizing antibodies and the development of new drugs that act as adjuvants to the function of the interferon-alpha-beta receptor gene.",

    "abstract": "Pests and pathogens are a continuous threat to the health of Western honey bees Apis mellifera L. Monitoring honey bee colonies for arthropod pests, disease-causing bacteria and fungi, and early detection of new invasions is essential to maintain the pollination services provided by honey bees. Here, we investigated the feasibility of using eDNA metabarcoding to detect honey bee pests and pathogens in their hives and across their foraging environment. We sampled 13 different surfaces within and outside hives from our test apiary to determine where the most informative eDNA could be obtained. Furthermore, we compared two main eDNA collection techniques - wiping surfaces with moistened forensic swabs and using a spray/wash technique that washed surface DNA into a bucket, before collecting the DNA on a filter. We used DNA metabarcoding with universal primer sets to target arthropod, bacterial and fungal communities. Our results showed that most surfaces yielded usable DNA, and that results of the swabs and spray/wash methods were similar when they could be applied to the same surface. We were able to detect DNA from the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida), Varroa destructor mites and European foulbrood (Melissococcus plutonius), all of which matched our visual observations of clinical signs of these pests and pathogens in the hives we tested. DNA from some species was location specific, which has implications for using eDNA as a monitoring tool. Collectively, our data show that eDNA metabarcoding can accurately detect DNA from arthropods and microbes honey bees contact and has the potential to provide information on disease and pest incidence, Apis species identity, and A. mellifera subspecies identity of the colony and/or apiary. In sum, eDNA metabarcoding can be used as a comprehensive molecular predictor tool for colony health surveys.",

    "abstract": "The identification and characterization of genomic safe harbor sites (GSH) aims to facilitate consistent transgene activity without disruption to the host cell genome. We combined genome annotation and chromatin structure analysis by computational approach to predict the location of four GSHs in the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, a major infectious pathogen of the tropics. Introduction of a transgene into the egg of the parasite was accomplished using CRISPR/Cas-assisted homology-directed repair and overlapping guide RNAs. Gene editing efficiencies of 24% and transgene-encoded fluorescence of 75% of gene-edited schistosome eggs were observed. These outcomes advance functional genomics for schistosomes by providing a tractable path towards transgenic helminths using homology directed repair-catalyzed transgene insertion. This approach should be adaptable to helminths generally.\n\nMotivationFunctional genomics methods are needed in the arena of the Neglected Tropical Diseases, especially for helminth parasites, to facilitate basic and transformational studies to improve global public health. Gain-of-function phenotypes would be valuable in this context. Hence, the motivation for this investigation was to identify a genome safe harbor (GSH) site in the chromosomes of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni and, in a pilot approach, and to develop methods for transgene insertion and methods to characterize transgene performance following homology directed insertion at the schistosome GSH. The progress reported here can be expected to advance functional genomics for species of the Platyhelminthes - including model, free living species of planarians, and should be adaptable to helminths generally.",

    "abstract": "Polysialic acid (polySia) is a long homopolymer consisting of 2,8-linked sialic acid with tightly regulated expression in humans. In healthy adults, it occurs on cell surface glycoproteins in neuronal, reproductive, and immune tissues; however, it is aberrantly present in many cancers and its overexpression correlates with significantly increased metastasis and poor prognosis. Prompted by the observation that the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line contains only intracellular polySia, we investigated the secretion of polySia from MCF-7 cells. PolySia was found predominantly on soluble proteins in MCF-7 conditioned media, but also on extracellular vesicles (EVs), secreted from the cells. Since MCF-7 cells do not express known polysialylated proteins, we developed a robust method for purifying polysialylated proteins that uses a metabolic labelling strategy to introduce a bioorthogonal functionality into polySia. Using this method we identified three previously unknown polysialylated proteins, and found that two of these proteins - AGR2 and QSOX2 - were secreted from MCF-7 cells. We confirmed that QSOX2 found in EV-depleted MCF-7 cell conditioned media was polysialylated. Herein we report the secretion of polysialic acid on both soluble and EV-associated proteins from MCF-7 cancer cells and introduce a new method to efficiently identify polysialylated proteins. These findings have exciting implications for understanding the roles of polySia in cancer progression and metastasis and for identifying new cancer biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas12a is an RNA-guided, programmable genome editing enzyme found within bacterial adaptive immune pathways. Unlike CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a uses only a single catalytic site to both cleave target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (cis-activity) and indiscriminately degrade single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (trans-activity). To investigate how the relative potency of cis- versus trans-DNase activity affects Cas12a-mediated genome editing, we first used structure-guided engineering to generate variants of Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas12a (LbCas12a) that selectively disrupt trans-activity. The resulting engineered mutant with the biggest differential between cis- and trans-DNase activity in vitro showed minimal genome editing activity in human cells, motivating a second set of experiments using directed evolution to generate additional mutants with robust genome editing activity. Notably, these engineered and evolved mutants had enhanced ability to induce homology-directed repair (HDR) editing by 2-18-fold depending on the genomic locus. Finally, we found that a site-specific reversion mutation produced improved Cas12a (iCas12a) variants with superior genome editing efficiency at genomic sites that are difficult to edit using wild-type Cas12a. This strategy of coupled rational engineering and directed evolution establishes a pipeline for creating improved genome editing tools by combining structural insights with randomization and selection. The availability of experimental and predicted structures of other CRISPR-Cas enzymes will enable this strategy to be applied to improve the efficacy of other genome editing proteins.",

By performing single-cell analysis, we identified activated, clonally expanded CD8+ T cells with a cytotoxic gene expression profile in the kidneys of patients with ANCA-associated cGN. Using an experimental model of cGN, we demonstrated that clonally expanded murine CD8+ T cells highly expressed the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Moreover, lack of CD8+ T cells or granzyme B resulted in an ameliorated course of cGN. This was associated with reduced cleaved caspase-3 induction in renal tissue cells.

We evaluated Dectin-1 function in myeloid cells in a cohort of HIV-positive and HIV-negative young and older adults. Stimulation of monocytes with {beta}-D-glucans induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in monocytes of HIV-infected individuals that was characterized by increased levels of IL-12, TNF-, and IL-6, with some age-associated cytokine increases also noted. Dendritic cells showed a striking HIV-associated increase in IFN- production. These increases in cytokine production paralleled increases in Dectin-1 surface expression in both monocytes and dendritic cells that were noted with both HIV and aging. Differential gene expression analysis showed that HIV-positive older adults had a distinct gene signature compared to other cohorts characterized by a robust TNF- and coagulation response (increased at baseline), a persistent IFN- and IFN-{gamma} response, and an activated dendritic cell signature/M1 macrophage signature upon Dectin-1 stimulation. Dectin-1 stimulation induced a strong upregulation of MTORC1 signaling in all cohorts, although increased in the HIV-Older cohort (stimulation and baseline). Overall, our study demonstrates that the HIV Aging population has a distinct immune signature in response to Dectin-1 stimulation.

Interferon-epsilon (IFN{varepsilon}) is a distinct, immunoregulatory type-I IFN that is constitutively expressed by FRT epithelium and is not induced by pathogens like other antiviral IFNs , {beta} and {lambda}. We show the necessity of IFN{varepsilon} for Zika Virus (ZIKV) protection by: increased susceptibility of IFN{varepsilon}-/- mice; their \"rescue\" by intravaginal recombinant IFN{varepsilon} treatment and blockade of protective endogenous IFN{varepsilon} by neutralising antibody. Complementary studies in human FRT cell lines showed IFN{varepsilon} had potent anti-ZIKV activity, associated with transcriptome responses similar to IFN{lambda} but lacking the proinflammatory gene signature of IFN. IFN{varepsilon} activated STAT1/2 pathways similar to IFN and {lambda} that were inhibited by ZIKV-encoded non-structural (NS) proteins, but not if IFN{varepsilon} exposure preceded infection. This scenario is provided by the constitutive expression of endogenous IFN{varepsilon}. However, the IFN{varepsilon} expression was not inhibited by ZIKV NS proteins despite their ability to antagonise the expression of IFN{beta} or {lambda}. Thus, the constitutive expression of IFN{varepsilon} provides cellular resistance to viral strategies of antagonism and maximises the antiviral activity of the FRT. These results show that the unique spatiotemporal properties of IFN{varepsilon} provides an innate immune surveillance network in the FRT that is a significant barrier to viral infection with important implications for prevention and therapy.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe female reproductive tract (FRT) is vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections and therefore a well-tuned immune surveillance system is crucial for maintaining a healthy FRT. However, our understanding of the factors that impact viral infection of the FRT and the host response are not well understood. In this work we investigate the role of a hormonally regulated type I interferon, IFN epsilon (IFN{varepsilon}) in control of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of the FRT. IFN{varepsilon} is unique compared to other canonical type-I IFNs in that it is constitutively expressed by epithelial cells of the FRT with expression levels controlled by progesterone and not in response to viral infection. We demonstrate that IFN{varepsilon} has anti-ZIKV properties using a combination of IFN{varepsilon} KO mice, blockade of endogenous IFN{varepsilon} by neutralising Abs and rescue of IFN{varepsilon} KO mice by recombinant IFN{varepsilon} administered directly to the FRT. Furthermore, we complemented our in vivo studies using human FRT derived cell lines. Importantly, ZIKV NS proteins did not block IFN{varepsilon} expression despite their ability to antagonise the expression of IFN{beta} or {lambda}. Collectively this work implicates IFN{varepsilon} as a key type-I IFN that provides a distinct homeostatic antiviral environment in the FRT.",

    "abstract": "The human gut harbors numerous viruses infecting the human host, microbes and other inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract. Most of these viruses remain undiscovered, and their influence on human health is unknown. Here we characterize viral genomes in gut metagenomic data from 1,950 individuals from four population and patient cohorts. We focus on a subset of viruses that is highly abundant in the gut, remains largely uncharacterized, and allows confident complete genome identification - phages that belong to the class Caudoviricetes and possess genome terminal repeats. We detect 1,899 species-level units belonging to this subset, 19% of which do not have complete representative genomes in major public gut virome databases. These units display diverse genomic features, are predicted to infect a wide range of microbial hosts, and on average account for < 1% of metagenomic reads. Analysis of longitudinal data from 338 individuals shows that the composition of this fraction of the virome remained relatively stable over a period of 4 years. We also demonstrate that 54 species-level units are highly prevalent (detected in > 5% of individuals in a cohort). Finally, we find 34 associations between highly prevalent phages and human phenotypes, 24 of which can be explained by the relative abundance of potential hosts.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy requires maternal adaptations to support fetal growth: whether these adaptations include temporal shifts in the gut microbiome is still unclear. We investigated the maternal gut microbiome longitudinally over the course of pregnancy and the impact of pre-pregnancy BMI (pBMI) and GWG. We also determined whether parity modulated observed associations. We show that the gut microbiota of participants with higher pBMI changed less over the course of pregnancy in primiparous, but not multiparous participants. This suggests that previous pregnancies may have persistent impacts on maternal adaptations to pregnancy. This ecological memory appears to be passed to the next generation, as parity modulated the impact of maternal GWG on the infant gut microbiome. This work supports a role for the gut microbiome in maternal adaptations to pregnancy and highlights the need for longitudinal sampling and accounting for parity as key considerations for studies of the microbiome in pregnancy and infants.",

    "abstract": "The human immune system employs several mechanisms to defend against pathogenic bacteria. However, pathogenic bacterial cells have evolved means to counter these responses, rendering our immune system less effective. Immunological agents that supplement or modulate the host immune response have proven to have powerful therapeutic potential, although this modality is less explored against bacterial pathogens. We describe the application of a bacterial binding protein to re-engage the immune system towards pathogenic bacteria. More specifically, a hapten was conjugated to a protein expressed by Ixodes scapularis ticks, called Ixodes scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFGP), that has high affinity for the D-alanine residue on the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall. We showed that a fragment of this protein retained high surface binding affinity. Moreover, when conjugated to a hapten this conjugate led to the display of haptens on the cell surface of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Hapten display then induced the recruitment of antibodies and promoted immune-cell mediated uptake of bacterial pathogens. These results demonstrate the feasibility in using cell wall binding agents as the basis of a class of bacterial immunotherapies against bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "When grown on agar surfaces, microbes can produce distinct multicellular spatial structures called colonies, which contain characteristic sizes, shapes, edges, textures, and degrees of opacity and color. For over one hundred years, researchers have used these morphology cues to classify bacteria and guide more targeted treatment of pathogens. Advances in genome sequencing technology have revolutionized our ability to classify bacterial isolates and while genomic methods are in the ascendancy, morphological characterization of bacterial species has made a resurgence due to increased computing capacities and widespread application of machine learning tools. In this paper, we revisit the topic of colony morphotype on the within-species scale and apply concepts from image processing, computer vision, and deep learning to a dataset of 69 environmental and clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. We find that colony morphology and complexity under common laboratory conditions is a robust, repeatable phenotype on the level of individual strains, and therefore forms a potential basis for strain classification. We then use a deep convolutional neural network approach with a combination of data augmentation and transfer learning to overcome the typical data starvation problem in biological applications of deep learning. Using a train/validation/test split, our results achieve an average validation accuracy of 92.9% and an average test accuracy of 90.7% for the classification of individual strains. These results indicate that bacterial strains have characteristic visual  fingerprints that can serve as the basis of classification on a sub-species level. Our work illustrates the potential of image-based classification of bacterial pathogens and highlights the potential to use similar approaches to predict medically relevant strain characteristics like antibiotic resistance and virulence from colony data.\n\nAuthor SummarySince the birth of microbiology, scientists have looked at the patterns of bacterial growth on agar (colony morphology) as a key tool for identifying bacterial species. We return to this traditional approach with modern tools of computer vision and deep learning and show that we can achieve high levels of classification accuracy on a within-species scale, despite what is considered a  data-starved dataset. Our results show that strains of the environmental generalist and opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have a characteristic morphological  fingerprint that enables accurate strain classification via a custom deep convolutional neural network. Our work points to extensions towards predicting phenotypes of interest (e.g. antibiotic resistance, virulence), and suggests that sample size limitations may be less restrictive than previously thought for deep learning applications in biology, given appropriate use of data augmentation and transfer-learning tools.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is suggested to be the greatest risk to human health, but new agents are not being brought to market as the rapid evolution of resistance to them means that drug development costs cannot be recouped. Fatty acids have been proposed as a new generation of antibiotics, but toxicity and poor absorption has meant that their use has been impractical in the past. Chitosan has been used to encapsulate other agents as nanoparticles, but has not been used with fatty acids. Here we show that chitosan can be modified to direct fatty acids towards Gram-positive or negative bacteria so that they exert antimicrobial effects. We show that fatty acids work as effective antibiotics in vitro and in vivo, with activity against extremely drug resistant pathogens. Bacteria exposed to them do not develop resistance to these agents, and they are not toxic to mammalian cells. Activity was seen against salmonellosis and C. difficile infection in animal models. Our results demonstrate that fatty acids formulated as chitosan nanoparticles are effective antibiotics, and can be used for a long period of time without resistance developing. This suggests that the usage of fatty acids coated in this manner could be sold in sufficient quantities to recoup its development costs, overcoming this barrier. These agents would form a new class of antibiotics, with the novel property of lack of bacterial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Induction of phenotypic heterogeneity is a ubiquitous consequence of bacterial stress responses. It is commonly postulated that isogenic cells exploit stochastic molecular fluctuations to generate phenotypic heterogeneity as a population survival strategy (termed bet-hedging). However, it is also possible that each cell attempts to maximise its own chances of survival. In that case, the apparent heterogeneity could either be caused by inevitable molecular noise or by underlying deterministic mechanisms which have escaped observation. Here, we investigated the sources and consequences of gene expression heterogeneity in the response of Escherichia coli cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stress. A machine-learning model accurately predicted the variable responses of individual cells growing in structured populations, indicating that the phenotypic heterogeneity has a deterministic origin. The model further showed that spatio-temporal dynamics in H2O2 concentration were dictated by the H2O2 scavenging capacity and morphology of cells in the local environment. Hence, oxidative stress response fluctuations were in fact the result of a precise and rapid feedback between each cell and its immediate environment. Although single cells optimise their individual responses, the formation of short-range H2O2 gradients by their scavenging activities increases stress tolerance at the population level and leads to spatial variation in mutation rates.",

    "abstract": "Zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) functions as a tumor suppressor in several models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), presumably through its control of target genes. Previous microarray data suggested that Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids 3 (Elovl3), a member of the Elovl family which synthesize very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), is a putative ZHX2 target gene. VLCFAs are core component of ceramides and other bioactive sphingolipids, which are often dysregulated in diseases, including HCC. Since several previously identified ZHX2 targets become dysregulated in HCC, we investigated the relationship between ZHX2 and Elovl3 in liver damage and HCC. Here, using mouse and cell models, we demonstrate that Zhx2 positively regulates Elovl3 expression in the liver and that male-biased hepatic Elovl3 expression is established between 4-8 weeks of age in mice. Elovl3 is dramatically repressed in mouse models of liver regeneration and HCC and the reduced Elovl3 levels in the regenerating liver are associated with changes in hepatic very long chain fatty acids. Human hepatoma cell lines with forced Elovl3 expression have lower rates of cell growth; analysis of synchronized cells indicate that this reduced proliferation correlates with cells stalling in S-phase. Taken together, these data indicate that Elovl3 expression helps regulate cellular proliferation, possibly through control of VLCFAs, and its repression may be a contributing factor to HCC and explain, in part, the function of ZHX2 as a suppressor of HCC progression.",

    "abstract": "Correcting for amplification biases in genetic metabarcoding data can yield quantitative estimates of template DNA concentrations. However, a major source of uncertainty in metabarcoding data is the presence of non-detections, where a technical PCR replicate fails to detect a species observed in other replicates. Such non-detections are an important special case of variability among technical replicates in metabarcoding data, particularly in environmental samples. While many sampling and amplification processes underlie observed variation in metabarcoding data, understanding the causes of non-detections is an important step in distinguishing signal from noise in metabarcoding studies. Here, we use both simulated and empirical data to 1) develop a qualitative understanding of how non-detections arise in metabarcoding data, 2) outline steps to recognize uninformative data in practice, and 3) identify the conditions under which amplicon sequence data can reliably detect underlying biological signals. We show in both simulations and empirical data that, for a given species, the rate of non-detections among technical replicates is a function of both the template DNA concentration and species-specific amplification efficiency. Consequently, we conclude metabarcoding datasets are strongly affected by (1) deterministic amplification biases during PCR and (2) stochastic sampling of amplicons during sequencing -- both of which we can model -- but also by (3) stochastic sampling of rare molecules prior to PCR, which remains a frontier for quantitative metabarcoding. Our results highlight the importance of estimating species-specific amplification efficiencies and critically evaluating patterns of non-detection in metabarcoding datasets to better distinguish environmental signal from the noise inherent in molecular detections of rare targets.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited uniparentally through the female germline without undergoing recombination. This poses a major problem as deleterious mtDNA mutations must be eliminated to avoid a mutational meltdown over generations. At least two mechanisms that can decrease the mutation load during maternal transmission are operational: a stochastic bottleneck for mtDNA transmission from mother to child, and a directed purifying selection against transmission of deleterious mtDNA mutations. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling these processes remain unknown. In this study, we systematically tested whether decreased autophagy contributes to purifying selection by crossing the C5024T mouse model harbouring a single pathogenic heteroplasmic mutation in the tRNAAla gene of the mtDNA with different autophagy-deficient mouse models, including knockouts of Parkin, Bcl2l13, Ulk1, and Ulk2. Our study reveals a robust effect of knockout of Bcl2l13 on the selection process, and weaker evidence for the effect of Ulk1 and potentially Ulk2, while no statistically significant impact is seen for knockout of Parkin. This points at distinctive roles of these players in germline purifying selection. Overall, our approach provides a framework for investigating the roles of other important factors involved in the enigmatic process of purifying selection and guides further investigations for the role of BCL2L13 in the elimination of non-synonymous mutations in protein-coding genes.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function during ageing is accompanied by transcriptional drift, altering gene expression and contributing to a variety of age-related diseases. CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) have emerged as key regulators of gene expression that might be targeted to promote longevity. Here, we define the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans CRTC-1 in the epigenetic regulation of longevity. Endogenous CRTC-1 binds chromatin factors, including components of the COMPASS complex, which trimethylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3). CRISPR editing of endogenous CRTC-1 reveals that the CREB-binding domain in neurons is specifically required for H3K4me3-dependent longevity. However, this effect is independent of CREB but instead acts via the transcription factor AP-1. Strikingly, CRTC-1 also mediates global histone acetylation levels, and this acetylation is essential for H3K4me3-dependent longevity. Indeed, overexpression of an acetyltransferase enzyme is sufficient to promote longevity in wild-type worms. CRTCs, therefore, link energetics to longevity by critically fine-tuning histone acetylation and methylation to promote healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "In many forensic settings, identity of a DNA sample is sought from poor-quality DNA, for which the typical STR loci tabulated in forensic databases are not possible to reliably genotype. Genome-wide SNPs, however, can potentially be genotyped from such samples via next-generation sequencing, so that queries can in principle compare SNP genotypes from DNA samples of interest to STR genotype profiles that represent proposed matches. We use genetic record-matching to evaluate the possibility of testing SNP profiles obtained from poor-quality DNA samples to identify exact and relatedness matches to STR profiles. Using 2,504 whole-genome sequences, we show that in some settings, similar match accuracies to those seen with full coverage of the genome are obtained by genetic record-matching for SNP data that represent 5-10% genomic coverage. Thus, if even a fraction of random genomic SNPs can be genotyped by next-generation sequencing, then the potential may exist to test the resulting genotype profiles for matches to profiles consisting exclusively of nonoverlapping STR loci. The result has implications in relation to criminal justice, mass disasters, missing-person cases, studies of ancient DNA, and genomic privacy.",

    "abstract": "XIST is a 17-19 kb long non-coding RNA critical for X-chromosome inactivation. Tandem repeats within the RNA serve as functional domains involved in the cis-limited recruitment of heterochromatic changes and silencing. To explore the sufficiency of these domains while generating a functional miniXIST for targeted silencing approaches, we tested inducible constructs integrated into 8p in a male cell line. Previous results suggested silencing could be accomplished with a transgene comprised of the repeat A which is highly conserved and critical for silencing; the repeat F which overlaps regulatory elements and the repeat E region which contributes to XIST localization by binding proteins such as CIZ1. As PRC1 is recruited through HNRNPK binding of repeats B - C - D we included a second  miniXIST comprising AFE with the mouse PID, a 600-nucleotide region of repeat B and C. Silencing of nearby genes was possible with and without PID, however, silencing more distally required the addition of PID. The recruitment of heterochromatic marks, evaluated by IF combined with RNA FISH, revealed that the AFE domains were sufficient only for the recruitment of CIZ1. However, miniXIST transgene recruited all marks, albeit not to full XIST levels. The ability of the PID domain to facilitate silencing and heterochromatic marks recruitment was unexpected, and inhibition of PRC1 suggested that many of these are PRC1-independent.

    "abstract": "We recently produced three web-based calculators that predict in vivo metal occupancies of proteins, based on the metal affinities of a protein of interest along with estimates of the availabilities of the labile buffered pools of metals inside a cell. Metal availabilities were calculated from the calibrated responses of DNA-binding, metal-sensing, transcriptional regulators. The availability of intracellular Fe(II) was estimated to be similar in E. coli grown under anaerobic conditions compared to cells grown aerobically in LB medium. The purpose of this article is to archive the background data that underpins the release of a new calculator for hyperaerated cells grown in flasks with baffles, with relatively low culture volumes plus high shaking speeds to give elevated oxygenation. The intracellular availability of Fe(II) calculated from the responses of the intracellular Fe(II) sensor Fur was estimated to be significantly lower in these hyperaerated cells than either of the previous values determined for anaerobic or aerobic cultures. The total number of atoms of Mn(II) per cell increased in hyperaerated cells albeit with only modest change in intracellular Mn(II) availability as estimated from the responses of the Mn(II) sensor MntR. Accurate determination of intracellular Ni(II) availability will require further calibration of the magnitude of the responses of the Ni(II) sensor NikR in hyperaerated cells to take account of the state of Fnr. The hyperaerated metalation calculator is made available online and as a spreadsheet, for use by others.",

    "abstract": "PERK is a transmembrane kinase located on the ER with a luminal domain that senses ER stresses, such as protein misfolding, and a cytosolic kinase domain. Upon stress sensing, PERK activates and phosphorylates eIF2 to attenuate global translation while upregulating select transcripts to re-establish protein homeostasis. In a secondary phase of signaling PERK can also induce apoptosis to dispose of terminally stressed and damaged cells. Thus, the delineated bi-phasic nature of PERK signaling requires tight regulation for homeostatic function, as evidenced by dysregulation of this pathway being implicated in many diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative conditions. Pursuant attempts to therapeutically modulate PERK and its signaling outcomes have highlighted that our understanding of the determinants of adaptive vs. mal-adaptive signaling remain ambiguous, and further delineation of PERK regulation is required. Here we report copper as a regulator of PERK kinase activity. PERK copper binding activity was confirmed by selective affinity for a copper charged resin and by ICP-MS quantification of bound copper. Mutation of the putative copper binding site, identified based on homology, abolished copper binding. Copper-binding was also determined to be necessary for kinase activity in in vitro kinase assays. Physiologic manipulation of copper availability in cells modulated PERK activity and signaling. Using this relationship, we show that copper availability determines ER stress tolerance and cell fate outcomes. This novel regulatory mechanism has broad implications for modulation of PERK activity in different diseases and disease models, and may constitute a previously unaccounted for variable in determining when PERK inhibition vs activation is therapeutically beneficial.",

Dimeric species was detected for 4B7-Db, but not for 1245-Db, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiment. The quality of the purified refolded fraction was assessed with differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). Refolded 4B7-Db, with a melting temperature of 59{degrees}C, recognized Pfs25 expressed on the surface of ookinete and zygote stages of Plasmodium in an immunofluorescence-based assay, whereas, 1245-Db, exhibiting a skewed melt profile, showed weak recognition. Further, refolded 4B7-Db recognized the linear epitope, on purified Pfs25 protein, both in the denatured and native state.

    "abstract": "The efficient development of eggs following a blood meal is central to the vector capacity of Anopheles gambiae females. The ecdysteroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) plays a pivotal role in this process, yet the signaling mechanisms by which 20E exerts its effects remain incompletely understood. Here we show blood feeding is associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of an array of proteins coincident with the increase in titers of 20E that follows a blood meal. Injection of genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduces both the appearance of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and fecundity, linking tyrosine phosphorylation to egg development. We identify one of the proteins phosphorylated after a blood meal as phospholipase C gamma (PLC{gamma}) and show that its blood feeding-induced phosphorylation is dependent on endogenously synthesized 20E via the ecdysone receptor (EcR). Interruption of Src-like tyrosine kinase signaling inhibits phosphorylation of PLC{gamma} as well as egg development after blood feeding, implicating Src-like kinases in the phosphorylation of PLC{gamma}. Taken together, these data suggest that the effects of 20E on An. gambiae egg development are at least partially mediated through a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascade involving Src family tyrosine kinases and PLC{gamma}.",

We showed that CCL5 also bound to site 2, in addition to site 1, and activated soluble integrin v{beta}3. Platelet integrin IIb{beta}3, a fibrinogen receptor, is critical for hemostasis and thrombus formation and activation of IIb{beta}3 is a key event for thrombus formation. Activation of IIb{beta}3 is known to be mediated exclusively by inside-out signaling. We studied if IIb{beta}3 can be allosterically activated. We discovered that CCL5, CXCL12, and CX3CL1 are new ligands for IIb{beta}3. Notably they enhanced the binding of monovalent ligand to soluble IIb{beta}3 in 1 mM Ca2+ by binding to site 2. They activated cell-surface IIb{beta}3 on CHO cells quickly (half maximal response <1 min) and at low concentrations (1-10 ng/ml) compared to soluble IIb{beta}3, probably because chemokines bind to cell surface proteoglycans. Notably, activation of IIb{beta}3 by the chemokines was several times more potent than 1 mM Mn2+. Since CCL5 and CXCL12 are stored in platelet granules and rapidly transported to the surface upon platelet activation, we hypothesized that they are released from the granules and allosterically activate IIb{beta}3 by binding to site 2.\n\nTransmembrane CX3CL1 on activated endothelial cells likely mediates platelet-endothelial interaction by binding to and activating IIb{beta}3. Also, over-produced chemokines during inflammation may trigger IIb{beta}3 activation, which is a possible missing link between inflammation and thrombosis.",

While multiple strategies are being explored for the control of cell surface sialosides, none that shows high selectivity between sialyltransferases or that targets a specific sialyl glycoform has yet to emerge. Here we describe a strategy to block the formation of 2,8-linked sialic acid chains (oligo- and polysialic acid) through the use of 8-keto-sialic acid as a chain-terminating metabolic inhibitor that, if incorporated, can not be elongated. 8-Keto-sialic acid is non-toxic at effective concentrations and serves to block polysialic acid synthesis in cancer cell lines and primary immune cells, with minimal effects on other sialyl glycoforms.",

    "abstract": "Bovine mastitis are mainly caused by bacterial infection. They are responsible for economic losses and have an impact on the health and welfare of animals. The increase in the somatic cell count in milk during mastitis is mainly due to the influx of neutrophils which have a crucial role in the elimination of pathogens. For a long time, these first line defenders has been view as microbes killers with limited role in the orchestration of the immune response. However, their role is more complex and we recently characterized a MHC-II expressing neutrophil subset with regulatory capacities in cattle. In this study, we questioned the implication of different neutrophils subsets in the mammary gland immunity during clinical and subclinical mastitis. Here, we described for the first time that, in blood as in milk, neutrophils are a heterogeneous population and encompass at least two subsets distinguishable with their expression of MHC-II. We observed higher bactericidal capacities of milk MHC-IIpos neutrophils as compared to their classical counterparts, due to a higher production of ROS and phagocytosis ability. MHC-IIpos neutrophils are enriched in milk during a subclinical mastitis as compared to blood. Moreover, we observed a positive and highly significant correlation between MHC-IIpos neutrophils and T lymphocytes present in milk during subclinical mastitis. To conclude, our study could open the way to the discovery of new biomarkers of mastitis inflammation.",

    "abstract": "New methods for the global identification of RNA-protein interactions have led to greater recognition of the abundance and importance of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in bacteria. Here, we expand this tool kit by developing SEC-seq, a method based on a similar concept as the established Grad-seq approach. In Grad-seq, cellular RNA and protein complexes of a bacterium of interest are separated in a glycerol gradient, followed by high-throughput RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses of individual gradient fractions. New RNA-protein complexes are predicted based on the similarity of their elution profiles. In SEC-seq, we have replaced the glycerol gradient with separation by size exclusion chromatography, which shortens operation times and offers greater potential for automation. Applying SEC-seq to Escherichia coli, we find that the method provides a higher resolution than Grad-seq in the lower molecular weight range up to [~]500 kDa. This is illustrated by the ability of SEC-seq to resolve two distinct, but similarly sized complexes of the global translational repressor CsrA with either of its antagonistic small RNAs, CsrB and CsrC. We also characterized changes in the SEC-seq profiles of the small RNA MicA upon deletion of its RNA chaperones Hfq and ProQ and investigated the redistribution of these two proteins upon RNase treatment. Overall, we demonstrate that SEC-seq is a tractable and reproducible method for the global profiling of bacterial RNA-protein complexes that offers the potential to discover yet-unrecognized associations between bacterial RNAs and proteins.",

Typhi with additional resistance to ciprofloxacin was the catalyst for the introduction of a typhoid conjugate vaccine program. To investigate the historic emergence and evolution of AMR of endemic S. Typhi in Zimbabwe and determined the population structure, gene flux and sequence polymorphisms of strains isolated prior to mass typhoid vaccination to provide a baseline for future evaluation of the effect of the vaccination program.\n\nMethodsWe determined the population structure, gene flux and sequence polymorphisms and reconstructed the evolution of AMR. The S. Typhi population structure was investigated in the context the genome sequence of 1904 strains isolated from 65 countries to reconstruct spread of endemic strains into Zimbabwe.\n\nFindingsThe population structure of S. Typhi in Zimbabwe is dominated by multidrug resistant genotype 4.3.1.1 (H58) that spread to Zimbabwe from neighboring countries around 2009. Evolution of AMR within Zimbabwe included acquisition of an IncN plasmid carrying a qnrS gene and a mutation in the quinolone resistance determining region of gyrA gene, both implicated in resistance to quinolone antibiotics. A minority population of antimicrobial susceptible S. Typhi genotype 3.3.1 strains was detected in typhoid cases.\n\nInterpretationThe currently dominant S.

    "abstract": "Across all walks of life, certain transfer RNA (tRNA) transcripts contain introns. Pre-tRNAs with introns require splicing to form the mature anticodon stem loop (ASL). In eukaryotes, tRNA splicing is initiated by the heterotetrameric tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex. All TSEN subunits are essential and mutations within the complex are associated with a family of neurodevelopmental disorders known as pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH). The pathogenesis of PCH is poorly understood. Moreover, a lack of structures for any eukaryotic TSEN complex has hindered our understanding of tRNA recognition and processing. Here, we report Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human TSEN*pre-tRNA complex, trapped in the pre-cleavage state, at near atomic resolution. These structures reveal the overall architecture of the complex, along with extensive tRNA binding interfaces within the complex. Although it shares structural homology with archaeal TSENs, the human TSEN complex contains additional features important for recognizing the acceptor stem and D-arm of the pre-tRNA. Our findings also establish the TSEN54 subunit as more than a simple molecular ruler; it functions as a pivotal scaffold for the pre-tRNA and the two endonuclease subunits, TSEN2 and TSEN34. Finally, the human TSEN structures enable detailed visualization of the molecular environments of PCH-causing missense mutations, providing crucial insight into the mechanism of eukaryotic pre-tRNA splicing and neurodevelopmental disease.",

    "abstract": "Proteases, especially MMPs, are attractive biomarkers given their central role in both physiological and pathological processes. Distinguishing MMP activity with degradable substrates, however, is a difficult task due to overlapping substrate specificity profiles. Here, we developed a system of peptomers (peptide-peptoid hybrids) to probe the impact of non-natural residues on MMP specificity for a MMP peptide consensus sequence. Peptoids are non-natural, N-substituted glycines with a large side chain diversity. Given the presence of a hallmark proline residue in the P3 position of MMP consensus sequences, we hypothesized that peptoids may offer N-substituted alternatives to generate differential interactions with MMPs. To investigate this hypothesis, peptomer substrates were exposed to five different MMPs, as well as bacterial collagenase, and monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine the rate of cleavage and the composition of degraded fragments, respectively. We found that peptoid residues are well-tolerated in the P3 and P3 substrate sites and that the identity of the peptoid in these sites displays moderate influence on the rate of cleavage. However, peptoid residues were even better tolerated in the P1 substrate site where activity was more strongly correlated with sidechain identity than sidechain position. All MMPs explored demonstrated similar trends in specificity for the peptomers but exhibited different degrees of variability in proteolytic rate. These kinetic profiles served as \"fingerprints\" for the proteases and yielded separation by multivariate data analysis. To further demonstrate practical application of this tunability in degradation kinetics, peptomer substrates were tethered into hydrogels and released over distinct timescales. Overall, this work represents a significant step toward the design of probes that maximize differential MMP behavior and presents design rules to tune degradation kinetics with peptoid substitutions, which has promising implications for diagnostic and prognostic applications using array-based sensors.",

However, the neural and computational underpinnings of this effect are poorly understood. One recent study recorded neural signals in the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) during a retro-cueing task, contrasting delay-period activity before (pre-cue) and after (post-cue) retrocue onset. They reported that in the pre-cue delay, the individual stimuli were maintained in independent subspaces of neural population activity, whereas in the post-cue delay, the prioritised items were rotated into a common subspace, potentially allowing a common readout mechanism. To understand how such representational transitions can be learnt through error minimisation, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with supervision to perform an equivalent cued-recall task. RNNs were presented with two inputs denoting conjunctive colour-location stimuli, followed by a pre-cue memory delay, a location retrocue, and a post-cue delay. We found that the orthogonal-to-parallel geometry transformation observed in the macaque LPFC emerged naturally in RNNs trained to perform the task. Interestingly, the parallel geometry only developed when the cued information was required to be maintained in short-term memory for several cycles before readout, suggesting that it might confer robustness during maintenance. We extend these findings by analysing the learning dynamics and connectivity patterns of the RNNs, as well as the behaviour of models trained with probabilistic cues, allowing us to make predictions for future studies. Overall, our findings are consistent with recent theoretical accounts which propose that retrocues transform the prioritised memory items into a prospective, action-oriented format.\n\nAuthor SummaryMany real-world scenarios require us to manipulate the contents of memory to guide behaviour. For example, when grocery shopping, initially we might keep all the items from our shopping list in mind (i.e., in our short-term memory). However, once we spot the dairy aisle, we might want to extract, or prioritise, the items from our list that belong to this category. The question of how such prioritisation of memory items is achieved in the brain is a topic of active research. A recent study in monkeys provided evidence that initially, individual memory items are kept from interfering with one another by being encoded by different brain activity patterns. However, following a contextual cue (akin to the dairy aisle sign), the short-term memory representations of the prioritised items are reconfigured into a format that collapses across the irrelevant differences and highlights aspects relevant for action. In this study, we modelled the emergence of these representational changes in an artificial neural network model. Our results help explain how such processes can be learnt from experience and why they might emerge in the biological brain.",

    "abstract": "Memory encoding and retrieval are critical sub-processes of episodic memory. While the hippocampus is involved in both, its connectivity with the neocortex during memory processing in humans has been elusive. This is partially due to variations in demands in common memory tasks, which inevitably recruit cognitive processes other than episodic memory. Conjunctive analysis of data from different tasks with the same core elements of encoding and retrieval can reduce the intrusion of patterns related to subsidiary perceptual and cognitive processing. Leveraging data from two large-scale functional resonance imaging studies with different episodic memory tasks (514 and 237 participants), we identified core hippocampal-cortical networks active during memory processing. Anterior and posterior hippocampus had distinct connectivity profiles, which were stable across resting state and memory tasks. Whereas no encoding-specific connectome emerged across tasks, during retrieval hippocampal connectivity was increased with areas known to be active during recollection, including medial prefrontal, inferior parietal, and parahippocampal cortices. This indicates that the stable functional connectivity of the hippocampus along its longitudinal axis is superposed by increased functional connectivity with the recollection network during retrieval, while encoding connectivity likely reflects contextual factors.",

    "abstract": "A paradox of testosterone effects is seen in adolescents vs. adults in social emotional approach-avoidance behavior. During adolescence, high testosterone levels are associated with increased anterior prefrontal (aPFC) involvement in emotion control, whereas during adulthood this neuro-endocrine relation is reversed. Rodent work shows that, during puberty, testosterone transitions from a neuro-developmental to a social-sexual activating hormone. In this study, we explored whether this functional transition is also present in human adolescents and young adults. Using a prospective longitudinal design, we investigated the role of testosterone on neural control of social emotional behavior during the transitions from middle to late adolescence and into young adulthood. Seventy-one individuals (tested at ages 14, 17, and 20 years) performed an fMRI-adapted approach-avoidance (AA) task involving automatic and controlled actions in response to social emotional stimuli. In line with predictions from animal models, the effect of testosterone on aPFC engagement decreased between middle and late adolescence, and shifted into an activational role by young adulthood - impeding neural control of emotions. This change in testosterone function was accompanied by increased testosterone-modulated amygdala reactivity. These findings qualify the testosterone-dependent maturation of the prefrontal-amygdala circuit supporting emotion control during the transition from middle adolescence into young adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Language depends critically on the integration of lexical information to derive semantic concepts. The neurobiology of this fundamental aspect of human cognition remains mostly unknown. Limitations of spatiotemporal resolution have previously rendered it difficult to disentangle processes involved in semantic integration from independent computations such as tracking word meaning and establishing referents. We utilized intracranial recordings (n = 58) during the presentation of orthographic descriptions that were either referential or non-referential to a common object. Referential contexts enabled high frequency broadband gamma activation (70-150 Hz) of a distributed network including the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), medial parietal cortex (MPC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the left, language-dominant hemisphere. Components of this network (IFS, MPC), alongside posterior superior temporal sulcus, showed greater engagement for trials that did not progressively isolate a limited set of referents, relative to trials that did. IFS and posterior middle temporal gyrus activity was modulated by semantic coherence, regardless of whether the sentence picked out a common object. Centered around IFS and spreading out dorsally towards middle frontal gyrus and ventrally towards anterior/posterior inferior frontal gyrus, we uncovered a cortical mosaic of functional specialization for reference, coherence and semantic narrowing. Early processing windows implicated IFS in all aspects of semantics, and in later windows sub-portions of IFS exposed a clearer functional tessellation with some remaining overlap. This work unveils how lateral fronto-temporal regions make distinctly rich semantic contributions and are involved jointly in semantic integration and conflict resolution, depending on the sub-region and processing stage.",

    "abstract": "A crucial ability of the human brain is to learn and exploit probabilistic associations between stimuli to facilitate perception and behavior by predicting future events. While studies have shown how perceptual relationships are used to predict sensory inputs, relational knowledge is often between concepts rather than percepts (e.g., we learned to associate cats with dogs, rather than specific images of cats and dogs). Here we asked if and how sensory responses to visual input may be modulated by predictions derived from conceptual associations. To this end we exposed participants to arbitrary word-word pairs (e.g., car - dog) repeatedly, creating an expectation of the second word, conditional on the occurrence of the first. In a subsequent session, we exposed participants to novel word-picture pairs, while measuring fMRI BOLD responses. All word-picture pairs were equally likely, but half of the pairs conformed to the previously formed conceptual (word-word) associations, whereas the other half violated this association. Results showed suppressed sensory responses throughout the ventral visual stream, including early visual cortex, to pictures that corresponded to the previously expected words compared to unexpected words. This suggests that the learned conceptual associations were used to generate sensory predictions that modulated processing of the picture stimuli. Moreover, these modulations were tuning-specific, selectively suppressing neural populations tuned towards the expected input. Combined, our results suggest that recently acquired conceptual priors are generalized across domains and used by the sensory brain to generate feature specific predictions, facilitating processing of expected visual input.",

    "abstract": "Two recent parallel research tracks link tertiary sulcal morphology--sulci that emerge last in gestation and continue to develop after birth--with functional features of the cerebral cortex and cognition, respectively. The first track identified a relationship between the mid-fusiform sulcus (MFS) in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and cognition in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second track identified a new tertiary sulcus, the inframarginal sulcus (IFRMS), that serves as a tripartite landmark within the posteromedial cortex (PMC). As VTC and PMC are structurally and functionally different in individuals with ASD compared to neurotypical controls (NTs), here, we integrated these two tracks with a twofold approach. First, we tested if there are morphological differences in VTC and PMC sulci between 50 NTs and 50 individuals with ASD. Second, we tested if tertiary sulcal morphology was linked to cognition in ASD individuals. Our twofold approach replicates and extends recent findings in five ways. First, in terms of replication, the standard deviation (STD) of MFS cortical thickness (CT) was increased in ASDs compared to NTs. Second, MFS length was shorter in ASDs compared to NTs. Third, the CT STD effect extended to other VTC and PMC sulci. Fourth, a subset of VTC and PMC morphological features were correlated between regions in ASD. Fifth, IFRMS depth was negatively associated with ADOS-GS score. These results empirically support a relationship between later-developing, tertiary sulci and ASD, providing a novel framework to study the relationship between brain structure and cognition in additional neurodevelopmental disorders in future studies.\n\nLay SummaryWe observed that some, but not all, morphological features of later-developing tertiary indentations (sulci) in the cerebral cortex differed significantly between neurotypical controls and individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In ASD, a subset of sulcal morphological features also correlated between brain areas and one feature reflected differences in cognition. Thus, studying these structures provides insight into how individual variability in structure is related to individual variability in cognition in ASD.",

We uncover general principles governing the organization of the RNA- chromatin interactome, demonstrating that nearly all ncRNAs exclusively interact with genes in close three-dimensional proximity to their locus, and provide a model predicting the interactome. We uncover RNAs that interact with many loci across the genome, and unveil thousands of unannotated RNAs that dynamically interact with chromatin.

    "abstract": "A comprehensive proteome map is essential to elucidate molecular pathways and protein functions. Although great improvements in sample preparation, instrumentation and data analysis already yielded impressive results, current studies suffer from a limited proteomic depth and dynamic range therefore lacking low abundant or highly hydrophobic proteins. Here, we combine and benchmark advanced micro pillar array columns ({micro}PAC) operated at nanoflow with Wide Window Acquisition (WWA) and the AI-based CHIMERYS search engine for data analysis to maximize chromatographic separation power, sensitivity and proteome coverage.\n\nOur data shows that {micro}PAC columns clearly outperform classical packed bed columns boosting peptide IDs by up to 140%. Already at classical narrow isolation widths CHIMERYS boosted ID rates by a factor of 2.6 compared to the conventional search engine MS Amanda 2.0. By combining CHIMERYS with WWA, even a 4.6-fold increase in ID rates could be achieved.\n\nUsing our optimized workflow, we were further able to identify more than 10,000 proteins from a single 2 h gradient shotgun analysis. We further investigated the applicability of WWA for single cell inputs and found that the choice of the optimal isolation window width depends on sample input and complexity. Using a short 5.5 cm column and very high flow rates during loading and column equilibration we improved sample throughput to [~]100 samples per day while maintaining high protein ID numbers. We believe that this is especially important for the single cell field where throughput is one of the most limiting factors.\n\nFinally, we applied our optimized workflow on immunoprecipitations of Smarca5/SNF2H and found 32 additional interaction partners compared to the original workflow utilizing a packed bed column. These additional interaction partners include previously described interaction partners of Smarca5 like Baz2b as well as undescribed interactors including Arid1a, which is also involved in chromatin remodeling and has been described as key player in neurodevelopmental and malignant disorders.",
