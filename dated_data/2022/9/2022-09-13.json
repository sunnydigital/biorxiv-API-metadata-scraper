    "abstract": "Helicases are motor enzymes found in every living organism and viruses, where they maintain the stability of the genome and control against false recombination. The DEAH-box helicase Prp43 plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing in unicellular organisms by translocating single-stranded RNA. The molecular mechanisms and conformational transitions of helicases are not understood at the atomic level. We present a complete conformational cycle of RNA translocation by Prp43 in atomic detail based on molecular dynamics simulations. To enable the sampling of such complex transition on the millisecond timescale, we combined two enhanced sampling techniques, namely simulated tempering and adaptive sampling guided by crystallographic data. During RNA translocation, the center-of-mass motions of the RecA-like domains followed the established inchworm model, whereas the domains crawled along the RNA in a caterpillar-like movement, suggesting an inchworm/caterpillar model. However, this crawling required a complex sequence of atomic-scale transitions involving the release of an arginine finger from the ATP pocket, stepping of the hook-loop and hook-turn motifs along the RNA backbone, and several others. These findings high-light that large-scale domain dynamics may be controlled by complex sequences of atomic-scale transitions.",

    "abstract": "Potential energy landscapes are useful models in describing events such as protein folding and binding. While single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments encode information on continuous potentials for the system probed, including rarely visited barriers between putative potential minima, this information is rarely decoded from the data. This is because existing analysis methods often model smFRET output assuming, from the onset, that the system probed evolves in a discretized state-space to be analyzed within a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) paradigm. By contrast, here we infer continuous potentials from smFRET data without discretely approximating the state-space. We do so by operating within a Bayesian nonparametric paradigm by placing priors on the family of all possible potential curves. As our inference accounts for a number of required experimental features raising computational cost (such as incorporating discrete photon shot noise), the framework leverages a Structured-Kernel-Interpolation Gaussian Process prior to help curtail computational cost. We show that our Structured-Kernel-Interpolation Priors for Potential Energy Reconstruction from smFRET (SKIPPER-FRET) analysis accurately infers the potential energy landscape from a smFRET binding experiment. We then illustrate advantages of SKIPPER-FRET over standard HMM approaches by providing information, such as barrier heights and friction coefficients, otherwise inaccessible to HMMs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe introduce SKIPPER-FRET, a tool for inferring continuous potential energy landscapes, including barrier heights, from single molecule smFRET data. We benchmark on synthetic and experimental data.",
