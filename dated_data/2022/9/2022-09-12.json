    "abstract": "A long-standing question in the field of signal transduction is to understand the interplay between distinct signaling pathways that control cell behavior. For growth factors and heterotrimeric G proteins, the two major signaling hubs in eukaryotes, the mechanisms of independent signal transduction have been extensively characterized; however, if/how they may cross talk remains obscure. Here we use linear-ion-trap mass spectrometry in combination with cell-based biophysical, biochemical, and phenotypic assays to chart at least three distinct ways in which growth factors may impact canonical G(i){beta}{gamma} signaling downstream of a GPCR (CXCR4) via phosphorylation of Gi. Phosphomimicking mutations in a cluster of residues in the E helix (Y154/Y155) result in the suppression of agonist-induced G(i) activation while promoting constitutive G{beta}{gamma} signaling; others in the P-loop (Ser44, Ser47, Thr48) suppress Gi activation entirely thus completely segregating the growth factor and GPCR pathways. While most phosphoevents appear to impact, as expected, the core properties of G(i) (conformational stability, nucleotide binding, G{beta}{gamma} association and release, etc.), one phosphomimicking mutation promoted mislocalization of Gi from the plasma membrane: a novel and unexpected mechanism of GPCR signal suppression. A phosphomutation of C-terminal Y320 was sufficient to orchestrate such suppression by protein compartmentalization. Findings not only elucidate how growth factor and chemokine signals crosstalk through phosphomodulation of Gi, but also how such crosstalk may generate signal diversity.",

    "abstract": "Cell division is spatiotemporally precisely regulated, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In the social, predatory bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, the PomX/PomY/PomZ proteins form a single large megadalton-sized complex that directly positions and stimulates cytokinetic ring formation by the tubulin homolog FtsZ. Here, we studied the structure and mechanism of this complex in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that PomY forms liquid-like biomolecular condensates by phase separation, while PomX self-assembles into filaments generating a single large cellular structure. The PomX structure enriches PomY, thereby guaranteeing the formation of precisely one PomY condensate per cell through surface-assisted condensation. In vitro, PomY condensates selectively enrich FtsZ and nucleate GTP-dependent FtsZ polymerization, suggesting a novel cell division site positioning mechanism in which the single PomY condensate enriches FtsZ to guide FtsZ-ring formation and division. PomY-nucleated FtsZ polymerization shares features with microtubule nucleation by biomolecular condensates in eukaryotes, supporting this mechanisms ancient origin.",

    "abstract": "The location of different actin-based structures is largely regulated by Rho GTPases through specific effectors. We use the apical aspect of epithelial cells as a model system to investigate how RhoA is locally regulated to contribute to two distinct adjacent actin-based structures. Assembly of the non-muscle myosin-2 filaments in the terminal web is dependent on RhoA activity, and assembly of the microvilli also requires active RhoA for phosphorylation and activation of ezrin. We show the RhoGAP, ARHGAP18, is localized by binding active microvillar ezrin, and this interaction enhances ARHGAP18s RhoGAP activity. We present a model where ezrin-ARHGAP18 acts as a negative autoregulatory module to locally reduce RhoA activity in microvilli. Consistent with this model, loss of ARHGAP18 results in disruption of the distinction between microvilli and the terminal web including aberrant assembly of myosin-2 filaments forming inside microvilli. Thus, ARHGAP18, through its recruitment and activation by ezrin, fine-tunes the local level of RhoA to allow for the appropriate distribution of actin-based structures between the microvilli and terminal web. As RhoGAPs vastly out-number Rho GTPases, this may represent a general mechanism whereby individual Rho effectors drive specific actin-based structures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLeft ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a prevalent cardiomyopathy associated with excessive trabeculation and thin compact myocardium. Patients with LVNC are vulnerable to cardiac dysfunction and at high risk of sudden death. Although sporadic and inherited mutations in cardiac genes are implicated in LVNC, understanding of the mechanisms responsible for human LVNC is limited.\n\nMethodsWe screened the complete exome sequence database of the Pediatrics Cardiac Genomics Consortium and identified a cohort with a de novo chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) proband, CHD4M202I, with congenital heart defects. We engineered a patient-specific model of CHD4M202I (mouse CHD4M195I). Histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and echocardiography were used to analyze cardiac anatomy and function. Ex vivo culture, immunopurification coupled with mass spectrometry, transcriptional profiling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to deduce the mechanism of CHD4M195I-mediated ventricular wall defects.\n\nResultsCHD4M195I/M195I mice developed biventricular hypertrabeculaion and noncompaction and died at birth. Proliferation of cardiomyocytes was significantly increased in CHD4M195I hearts, and the excessive trabeculation was associated with accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and a reduction of ADAMTS1, an ECM protease. We rescued the hyperproliferation and hypertrabeculation defects in CHD4M195I hearts by administration of ADAMTS1. Mechanistically, the CHD4M195I protein showed augmented affinity to endocardial BRG1. This enhanced affinity resulted in failure of derepression of Adamts1 transcription such that ADAMTS1-mediated trabeculation termination was impaired.\n\nConclusionsOur study reveals how a single mutation in the chromatin remodeler CHD4, in mice or humans, modulates ventricular chamber maturation and that cardiac defects associated with the missense mutation CHD4M195I can be attenuated by the administration of ADAMTS1.\n\nClinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat Is New?C_ST_ABSO_LIA patient-specific mouse model of CHD4M202I develops ventricular hypertrabeculation and dies at birth.\nC_LIO_LIProliferation of cardiomyocytes is significantly enhanced in CHD4M195I mice.\nC_LIO_LIADAMTS1 is significantly downregulated in CHD4M195I mice.\nC_LIO_LIClose interaction between CHD4M195I and BRG1 robustly and continuously represses Adamts1 transcription, which impairs ADAMTS1-mediated termination of trabeculation in the developing mutant heart.\nC_LI\n\nWhat Are the Clinical Implications?O_LIThis study provides a unique mouse model of ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy that faithfully reflects human patients genetic condition without disturbing the target genes expression and localization.\nC_LIO_LITranscriptional repression of ECM protease ADAMTS1 by CHD4-BRG1 interaction is detrimental to ventricular wall maturation; maintaining appropriate ADAMTS1 levels in the heart could be a promising therapeutic approach for treating ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Following infection of bacterial cells, bacteriophage modulate double-stranded DNA break repair pathways to protect themselves from host immunity systems and prioritise their own recombinases. Here we present biochemical and structural analysis of two phage proteins, gp5.9 and Abc2, which target the DNA break resection complex RecBCD. These exemplify two contrasting mechanisms for control of DNA break repair in which the RecBCD complex is either inhibited or co-opted for the benefit of the invading phage. Gp5.9 completely inhibits RecBCD by preventing it from binding to DNA. The RecBCD-gp5.9 structure shows that gp5.9 acts by substrate mimicry, binding predominantly to the RecB arm domain and competing sterically for the DNA binding site. Gp5.9 adopts a parallel coiled-coil architecture that is unprecedented for a natural DNA mimic protein. In contrast, binding of Abc2 does not substantially affect the biochemical activities of isolated RecBCD. The RecBCD-Abc2 structure shows that Abc2 binds to the Chi-recognition domains of the RecC subunit in a position that might enable it to mediate the loading of phage recombinases onto its single-stranded DNA products.",
