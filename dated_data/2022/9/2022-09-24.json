    "abstract": "Brain requires increased local cerebral blood flow (CBF) for as long as necessary during neuronal activation to match O2 and glucose supply with demand - termed functional hyperemia. Ca2+ elevation in astrocytes can drive arteriole dilation to increase CBF, yet affirmative evidence for the necessity of astrocytes in functional hyperemia in vivo is lacking. In awake and active mice, we discovered that functional hyperemia is bimodal with a distinct early and late component whereby arteriole dilation progresses as sensory stimulation is sustained. Clamping astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in vivo by expressing a high-affinity plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (CalEx) reduces sustained but not brief sensory-evoked arteriole dilation. Reciprocally, elevating astrocyte free Ca2+ using chemogenetics selectively augments sustained but not brief hyperemia. Neither locomotion, arousal, nor changes in neuronal signaling account for the selective effect of astrocyte Ca2+ on the late phase of the CBF response. Antagonizing NMDA-receptors or epoxyeicosatrienoic acid production reduces only the late component of functional hyperemia, leaving brief increases in CBF to sensory stimulation intact. We propose that a fundamental role of astrocyte Ca2+ is to amplify functional hyperemia when neuronal activation is prolonged.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhether interactions between species are conserved on evolutionary time-scales has spurred the development of both correlative and process-based approaches for testing phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions: do closely related species interact with similar partners? Here we use simulations to test the statistical performances of the two approaches that are the most widely used in the field: Mantel tests and the Phylogenetic Bipartite Linear Model (PBLM). Mantel tests investigate the correlation between phylogenetic distances and dissimilarities in sets of interacting partners, while PBLM is a process-based approach that relies on strong assumptions about how interactions evolve. We find that PBLM often detects a phylogenetic signal when it should not. Simple Mantel tests instead have infrequent false positives and moderate statistical power; however, they often artifactually detect that closely related species interact with dissimilar partners. Partial Mantel tests, which are used to partial out the phylogenetic signal in the number of partners, actually fail at correcting for this confounding effect, and we instead recommend evaluating the significance of Mantel tests with network permutations constraining the number of partners. We also explore the ability of simple Mantel tests to analyze clade-specific phylogenetic signals. We provide general guidelines and an application on an interaction network between orchids and mycorrhizal fungi.",

    "abstract": "Sphingolipid and ganglioside metabolic pathways are crucial components of cell signalling, having established roles in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. However, regulatory mechanisms controlling sphingolipid and ganglioside biosynthesis in mammalian cells is less known. Here, we show that RICTOR, the regulatory subunit of mTORC2, regulates the synthesis of sphingolipids and gangliosides in luminal breast cancer-specific MCF-7 and BT-474 cells through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. RICTOR regulates glucosylceramide levels by modulating the expression of UDP-Glucose Ceramide Glucosyl transferase (UGCG). We identify Zinc Finger protein X-linked (ZFX) as a RICTOR-responsive transcription factor whose recruitment to the UGCG promoter is regulated by DNA methyltransferases and histone demethylase (KDM5A) that are known AKT substrates. We further demonstrate that RICTOR regulates the synthesis of GD3 gangliosides through ZFX and UGCG, and triggers the activation of EGFR signalling pathway, thereby promoting tumor growth. In line with our findings in cell culture and mice models, we observe an elevated expression of RICTOR, ZFX, and UGCG in Indian luminal breast cancer tissues, and in TCGA and METABRIC datasets. Together, we establish a key regulatory circuit, RICTOR-AKT-ZFX-UGCG-Ganglioside-EGFR-AKT, and elucidate its contribution to breast cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) extends lifespan via pleotropic mechanisms, but one important molecular mediator of the beneficial effects of IF is AMP-kinase (AMPK). AMPK enhances lipid metabolism and modulates microtubule dynamics. Dysregulation of these two molecular pathways causes right ventricular (RV) failure in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In two models of rodent PAH, we show IF activates RV AMPK, which restores mitochondrial morphology and peroxisomal density and restructures mitochondrial/peroxisomal lipid metabolism protein regulation. IF also increases electron transport chain (ETC) protein abundance and activity in the RV. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic measures of RV function are positively associated with fatty acid oxidation and ETC protein levels in correlational heatmapping analyses. IF also combats heightened microtubule density, which normalizes t-tubule structure. In summation, we demonstrate IF-mediated AMPK signaling counteracts two key molecular drivers of RV failure. Thus, IF may be a novel treatment approach for RV dysfunction, a currently untreatable and lethal consequence of PAH.\n\nHighlights- Intermittent fasting activates AMPK to restructure right ventricular mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid fatty acid metabolism in two rodent models of PAH.\n- Intermittent fasting prevents downregulation of multiple electron transport chain proteins in both monocrotaline and Sugen-hypoxia RVs.\n- Pathological microtubule-mediated junctophilin-2 dysregulation and subsequent t-tubule remodeling is mitigated by intermittent fasting.\n- Intermittent fasting suppresses the induction of both the canonical and peroxisomal ferroptosis pathways in RV failure.",

    "abstract": "Different sleep states have been shown to be vital for a variety of brain function, including learning, memory, and skill consolidation. However, our understanding of neural dynamics during sleep and the role of prominent LFP frequency bands remain incomplete. To elucidate such dynamics and changes between different behavioral states we collected multichannel LFP and spike data in primary motor cortex of unconstrained macaques for up to 24 hours using the Neurochip3. Each 8 second bin of time was classified into awake and moving (Move), awake and at rest (Rest), REM sleep (REM), or non-REM sleep (NREM) by using dimensionality reduction and clustering on the average spectral density and the acceleration of the head. LFP power showed high delta during NREM, high theta during REM, and high beta when the animal was awake. Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling typically showed higher coupling for deeper sleep between all pairs of frequency bands. Two notable exceptions were high delta-high gamma and theta-high gamma coupling during Move, and high theta-beta coupling during REM. Sorted single units showed decreased firing rate with deeper sleep, though with higher \"bursty\" patterns during NREM compared to other states. Spike-LFP synchrony showed high delta synchrony during Move, and higher coupling with all other frequency bands with deeper sleep.\n\nThese results altogether are consistent with previous findings showing reactivation of cortical circuitry during sleep, which may be moderated by delta band LFP.",

    "abstract": "There are many mechanisms that give rise to genomic change: while point mutations are often emphasized in genomic analyses, evolution acts upon many other types of genetic changes that can result in less subtle perturbations. Changes in chromosome structure, DNA copy number, and novel transposon insertions all create large genomic changes, which can have correspondingly large impacts on phenotypes and fitness. In this study we investigate the spectrum of adaptive mutations that arise in a population under consistently fluctuating nitrogen conditions. We specifically contrast these adaptive alleles and the mutational mechanisms that create them, with mechanisms of adaptation under batch glucose limitation and constant selection in low, non-fluctuating nitrogen conditions. We observe that retrotransposon activity accounts for a substantial number of adaptive events, along with microhomology-mediated mechanisms of insertion, deletion, and gene conversion. In addition to loss of function alleles, which are often exploited in genetic screens, we identify adaptive gain of function alleles and alleles acting through as-of-yet unclear mechanisms. Taken together, our findings emphasize that how selection (fluctuating vs. non-fluctuating) is applied also shapes adaptation, just as the selective pressure (nitrogen vs. glucose) does itself. Fluctuating environments can activate different mutational mechanisms, shaping adaptive events accordingly. Experimental evolution, which allows a wider array of adaptive events to be assessed, is thus a complementary approach to both classical genetic screens and natural variation studies to characterize the genotype-to-phenotype-to-fitness map.",

Evaluating this using in vitro screening is laborious and can be informed by computational analyses of plasmid-host compatibility through rates of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between plasmid and host cell proteins. We identified large excesses of such PPIs in eight important plasmids, including pOXA-48, using most known bacteria (n=4,363). 23 species had high rates of interactions with four blaOXA-48-positive plasmids. We also identified 48 species with high interaction rates with plasmids common in Escherichia coli. We found a strong association between one plasmid and the fimbrial adhesin operon pil, which could enhance host cell adhesion in aqueous environments. An excess rate of PPIs could be a sign of host-plasmid compatibility, which is important for AMR control given that plasmids like pOXA-48 move between species with ease.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe tested for protein interactions between key plasmids and 4,363 bacterial hosts\nC_LIO_LI23 host species had high rates of protein interactions with four blaOXA-48 plasmids\nC_LIO_LIPseudomonas species showed high rates of interactions with these plasmids\nC_LIO_LIHost-plasmid protein-protein interaction rates may be associated with compatibility\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mediolateral ankle moment control contributes to gait stability. Ankle moments can be constrained by walking with a shoe with a ridge underneath the sole, narrowing the mediolateral support surface. In our previous study, such ankle moment constraints resulted in an increased step width and a decrease in the degree of foot placement control, as defined by the percentage of variance in foot placement that can be explained by CoM state. However, since our previous study was performed on a split-belt treadmill and the narrow ridge could fit inside the gap between the belts, it is not evident whether these effects can be attributed to the constrained ankle moment control or to avoidance of this gap. Therefore, we investigated if the effects of ankle moment constraints are dependent on whether participants walk on a normal treadmill or a split-belt treadmill. We included fourteen healthy young adults. Walking with constrained ankle moment control resulted in a wider step width on both treadmills. Yet, the increase in step width was larger on the split-belt treadmill compared to on the normal treadmill. We only found a decreased degree of foot placement control on the split-belt treadmill, whilst the degree of foot placement control increased on the normal treadmill. We conclude that the effects of ankle moment constraints reported in our previous study were confounded by the use of a split-belt treadmill. For future research, we recommend using a normal treadmill whenever possible, because the gap in a split-belt treadmill might affect gait parameters.",

    "abstract": "Being the first stimulated by the relative movement of foot skin and the underneath moving support surface, the plantar tactile receptors (i.e., mechanoreceptors) play an important role in the sensorimotor transformation giving rise to a postural reaction. In this light, a biomimetic surface, i.e., complying with the characteristics of the mechanoreceptors and the skin dermatoglyphs (i.e., pattern of the ridges) should facilitate the cortical processes in response to the somatosensory stimulation involved in the balance recovery motor control. Healthy young adults (n = 21) were standing still either on a biomimetic surface or on two control surfaces (i.e., grooved or smooth), when a sudden but low acceleration of the supporting surface along the lateral direction was triggered. A shorter and more robust evoked somatosensory response (i.e., SEP) was observed when participants were standing on the biomimetic surface. As well, a lower oscillatory response in the theta (5-7 Hz) time-frequency domain in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was observed with the biomimetic surface. The greater shear forces induced by the interaction between the feet and the biomimetic surface during the platform motion was likely at the origin of the increased SEP. Besides, the decrease of theta power suggests that the balance task became less challenging. This interpretation was tested in a second experiment by adding a cognitive task, which should be less detrimental for the postural reaction when standing on a biomimetic surface. Consistent with this hypothesis, a more efficient postural reaction (i.e., shorter latency and greater amplitude) was observed when the cognitive task was performed while standing on the biomimetic surface.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a key antimicrobial feature of cellular innate immunity mediated by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the primary human leukocyte population. NETs trap and kill microbes but have also been linked to inflammation, e.g. atherosclerosis, arthritis or psoriasis by unknown mechanisms. We here characterize naRNA (NET-associated RNA), as a new canonical, abundant, and unexplored inflammatory NET component. naRNA, upon release by NET formation, drove further NET formation in naive PMN, and induced macrophage and keratinocyte activation via TLR8 in humans and Tlr13 in mice, in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in vivo naRNA strongly drove skin inflammation, whereas genetic ablation of RNA sensing drastically ameliorated psoriatic skin inflammation. Rather than accidentally assembling with LL37 on the NET, naRNA was intracellularly pre-associated in resting neutrophils as a  composite DAMP, thus highlighting NET formation as a DAMP release process. This re-defines sterile NETs as an intentionally inflammatory agent, signaling and amplifying neutrophil activation. Moreover, in the many conditions previously linked to NETs and extracellular RNA, TLR-mediated naRNA sensing emerges as both potential cause and new intervention target.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499571v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (94K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b866org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16139ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a2905org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b0e7e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Created with biorender.com",

    "abstract": "The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway plays an important role in the establishment of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis (ECM) between Laccaria bicolor and poplar. We previously showed that the L. bicolor effector MiSSP7 induces the stabilization of the poplar JAZ6, a JA co-repressor protein that binds to Populus MYC2.1 and MYC2.2, orthologs of the Arabidopsis MYC2 transcription factor (TF), blocking their activity. Here we showed that both TFs play a central role in root colonization by L. bicolor mycelium, since their overexpression decreased the formation of the Hartig net, the hyphal network involved in symbiotic nutrient exchanges. By combining RNA sequencing and DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (DAP-seq) analysis, we identified a core set of JA-responsive genes directly activated by poplar MYC2.1 and MYC2.2, that need to be bypassed by the fungi to colonize root apoplastic spaces. These genes encode for other TFs, receptor-like kinases and many defense-related proteins, including terpene synthases (TPS). Monoterpenes produced by some of these TPS impact L. bicolor growth and ECM formation, suggesting a role for poplar root monoterpenes as negative regulators of in planta fungal growth and ECM symbiosis.\n\nSignificance statementThe ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is a predominant mutualistic plant-fungus interaction occurring in forests, sustaining tree health. Ectomycorrhizal fungi colonize the root intercellularly establishing the symbiotic interface required for bidirectional nutrients exchanges, the Hartig net. During root colonization, the fungus L. bicolor produces the effector protein MiSSP7 that binds to the jasmonate co-receptor PtJAZ6, maintaining the repression of MYC2-targeted genes. Here we showed that defensive genes are major targets of MYC2, suggesting that their strict control is required to allow fungal colonization, with special emphasis on the host root monoterpene synthesis. Future research will focus on how root terpene defenses mediate belowground mutualistic interactions and how they can be manipulated to engineer plants with enhanced disease resistance but stable mutualistic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Managing cultivated grasslands in a sustainable way is controversial, because it often goes along with economical loss and additional effort for local farmers. On the plus side, such a management could permit inhabiting species not only to survive but to thrive and expand their range. In order to satisfy both aspects, it can be helpful to minimize conservation effort to a degree that is still ecologically beneficial but intervenes as little as possible with regional land-use customs. Computer simulations are a useful tool to find such compromises prior to implementing management strategies. We simulated the population development of the large marsh grasshopper, a grassland species with limited dispersal abilities, in a disturbed and climatically changing environment of Germany up to the year 2080. Our results show that - in a spatially aggregated landscape - adapting the harvesting schedule in a relatively low number [&le;] 7 % of (in)directly connected yet otherwise intensively managed grasslands suffices for species preservation and even expansion to some extent. The effect on dispersal success of additional conservation effort above this 7 % threshold is significantly lower than it is below the threshold. In terms of population size, however, every additional refuge benefits the grasshopper. Climate change enhances the positive effects on the target species even further. A higher level of fragmentation, however, requires a substantially larger conservation effort in terms of protected grassland proportion. Therefore, it is recommended and more effective to focus on the implementation of protected areas within spatially aggregated grasslands. Stakeholders should additionally be aware of the fact that it can take several years for a conservation effort to become apparent and measurable, especially if the goal is to support an isolated or reintroduced species in expanding into unpopulated territories.",

    "abstract": "Variability of proteins at the sequence level creates an enormous potential for proteome complexity. Exploring the depths and limits of this complexity is an ongoing goal in biology. Here, we systematically survey human and plant high-throughput bottom-up native proteomics data for protein truncation variants, where substantial regions of the full-length protein are missing from an observed protein product. In humans, Arabidopsis, and the green alga Chlamydomonas, approximately one percent of observed proteins show a short form, which we can assign by comparison to RNA isoforms as either likely deriving from transcript-directed processes or limited proteolysis. While some detected protein fragments align with known splice forms and protein cleavage events, multiple examples are previously undescribed, such as our observation of fibrocystin proteolysis and nuclear translocation in a green alga. We find that truncations occur almost entirely between structured protein domains, even when short forms are derived from transcript variants. Intriguingly, multiple endogenous protein truncations of phase-separating translational proteins resemble cleaved proteoforms produced by enteroviruses during infection. Some truncated proteins are also observed in both humans and plants, suggesting that they date to the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Finally, we describe novel proteoform-specific protein complexes, where loss of a domain may accompany complex formation.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic excitation (E) and inhibition (I) stay relatively proportional to each other over different spatiotemporal scales, orchestrating neuronal activity in the brain. This proportionality, referred to as E-I balance, is thought to be critical for neuronal functions because its disruption was observed in many neurological disorders. However, the causal evidence demonstrating its significance is scarce. Here we show that deleting Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), a postsynaptic adhesion molecule at inhibitory synapses, from mouse glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons reduces inhibition cell-autonomously without affecting excitation, thereby disrupting E-I balance and causing lethality. In contrast, deleting Nlgn2 constitutively or simultaneously from both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons results in viable mice. A neural network model shows that reducing inhibition in either neuronal type is detrimental to network activity, but in both types partially re-establishes E-I balance and activity. Together, our results provide evidence for an essential role of E-I balance in brain functions and organism survival.",

For example, male Drosophila melanogaster extends their mating duration when surrounded by conditions enriched with rivals. Here we report a novel form of behavioral plasticity whereby male fruit flies exhibit a shortened duration of mating when they are sexually experienced; we refer to this plasticity as  shorter-mating-duration (SMD). SMD is a plastic behavior and requires sexually dimorphic taste neurons. We identified several neurons in the male foreleg and midleg that express specific sugar, pheromone and mechanosensory receptors. Using a cost-benefit model and behavioral experiments, we further show that SMD behavior exhibits adaptive behavioral plasticity in male flies. Thus, our study delineates the molecular and cellular basis of the sensory inputs required for SMD; this represents a plastic interval timing behavior that could serve as a model system to study how multisensory inputs converge to modify interval timing behavior for improved adaptation.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYMale flies use information derived from their previous sexual experiences from multiple sensory inputs to optimize their investment in mating.",

We derived novel compounds from DMDC and tested their effectiveness as copper-dependent antimicrobials against S. pneumoniae through in vitro growth and killing curves. Compounds that caused a growth defect and were bactericidal in vitro were tested against other strains of S. pneumoniae and in complex with different transition metals. We found two compounds, sodium N-benzyl-N-methyldithiocarbamate and sodium N-allyl-N-methyldithiocarbamate (herein \"Compound 3\" and \"Compound 4\"), were effective against TIGR4, D39, and ATCC(R) 6303 (a type 3 capsular strain) and further increased the internal concentrations of copper to the same previously reported levels as with DMDC and copper treatment. We found that both Compound 3 and Compound 4 were bacteriostatic in combination with zinc. We tested Compound 3 and Compound 4 in vivo against a murine pneumonia model, finding that Compound 3, and not Compound 4, was effective in significantly decreasing the bacterial burden in the blood and lungs of S. pneumoniae-infected mice.

The sensor system can be read out via conventional fluorescence microscopy or microtiter plate analysis and can also be combined with Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and subsequent transcriptome analysis. Various stressors, such as the biotechnologically relevant 2-propanol, lead to the activation of one, two or all three SRs, which can have a significant impact on non-stress-related metabolic pathways.

    "abstract": "How transcription factors (TF) selectively occupy a minute subset of their binding sites from a sizeable pool of putative sites in large mammalian genomes remains an important unanswered question. In part, nucleosomes help by creating formidable barriers to TF binding. TF concentration itself plays a crucial role in the competition between TFs and nucleosomes. In the case of nuclear receptors, the ligand adds another layer of complexity. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) is a classic example where its main ligand estradiol (E2) can modulate ER binding on chromatin. Here we show a complete rewiring of ER binding as a function of E2 concentration. As E2 concentration increases by two orders of magnitude, ER levels decrease, and ER binding localizes to promoter-distal sites with strong ER motifs. At low E2 levels, abundant levels of ER are present in the nucleus, and ER binding occurs mostly at sites without an identifiable ER binding motif, potentially in cooperation with other TFs like STAT1. We propose that E2s effect on ER activity plays a major role in defining genome-wide ER binding profiles. Thus, variations in E2 concentrations in ER-positive breast tumors could be a significant factor driving heterogeneity in tumor phenotype, treatment response, and potentially drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of genomes in all life forms involves two distinct, dynamic types of genomic changes: gene duplication (and loss) that shape families of paralogous genes and extension (and contraction) of low complexity regions (LCR), which occurs through dynamics of short repeats in protein-coding genes. Although the roles of each of these types of events in genome evolution have been studied, their co-evolutionary dynamics is not thoroughly understood. Here, by analyzing a wide range of genomes from diverse bacteria and archaea, we show that LCR and paralogy represent two distinct routes of evolution that are inversely correlated. Emergence of LCR is a prominent evolutionary mechanism in fast evolving, young protein families, whereas paralogy dominates the comparatively slow evolution of old protein families. Analysis of multiple prokaryotic genomes shows that the formation of LCR is likely a widespread, transient evolutionary mechanism that temporally and locally affects also ancestral functions, but apparently, fades away with time, under mutational and selective pressures, yielding to gene paralogy. We propose that compensatory relationships between short-term and longer-term evolutionary mechanisms are universal in the evolution of life.\n\nSignificanceEvolution of genomes in all organisms involves a variety of changes occurring on different spatial and temporal scales, from point mutations to whole genome duplication. Here we demonstrate that during the evolution of bacterial and archaeal genomes, there is a universal inverse relationship between the formation of low complexity regions in protein sequences through proliferation of short repeats and gene duplication. The former process apparently is a route of short-term adaptation whereas the latter one dominates evolution on longer temporal scales. We propose that compensatory relationships between evolutionary mechanisms acting at different spatial and temporal scales are a general feature of the process of evolution.",

However, the cellular mechanisms and physiological roles of synapse elimination in ODP are largely unknown. Here, we show that astrocytic phagocytosis of thalamo-cortical synapses in V1 is a critical mediator of ODP. We found that astrocytes, but not microglia, start to engulf thalamo-cortical synapses within 24 hours after monocular deprivation and that astrocytic synapse elimination is highly selective for synapses from the deprived eye, as revealed by AAV1-mediated trans-synaptic anterograde tracing of synapse phagocytosis reporters. Importantly, mice without the Megf10 phagocytic receptor in astrocytes exhibit deficits in eliminating the synapses from the deprived eye, leading to the failure to reduce the number of thalamo-cortical synapses after monocular deprivation. Remarkably, Megf10-deficient animals show severe defects in monocular deprivation-induced cortical synapse remodeling and subsequent expansion of the thalamo-cortical circuitry from the nondeprived eye. Taken together, our data show that astrocytic synapse elimination through MEGF10 is one of the key components in ODP, revealing the physiological importance of astrocytic phagocytosis in experience-dependent synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "16S rRNA gene sequences are commonly analyzed for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies because they contain hypervariable regions that can help distinguish different genera. However, intra-genus distinction is often difficult due to high sequence identities among closely related species. Although common tools for 16S sequence taxonomic classification weight residue variations equally during comparisons, specific residues within hypervariable regions have not drifted evenly through evolution, suggesting that portions of them may be biologically important. We developed an in vivo test system where 16S variants coexisted among natural ribosome populations which allowed their fitness to be evaluated. We found that versions with evolutionarily disparate hypervariable regions were underpopulated in ribosomes and active translation pools, even for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which indicates functional constraints to the free evolutionary drift of hypervariable regions. Using an in silico method (positional relative entropy), we analyzed over 12,000 16S V3-V4 sequences across Escherichia and Shigella strains and identified species that can be distinguished by position-specific SNPs present in multiple 16S alleles in a genome. When we evaluated these informative SNPs with our in vivo system, we discovered that ribosomes harboring them were compromised, suggesting that their evolution is indeed biologically constrained. Overall, this study demonstrates that SNPs within hypervariable regions are not necessarily inconsequential and that common computational approaches for taxonomic 16S rRNA sequence classification should not assume an even probability of residues at each position.\n\nImportanceHypervariable regions within 16S rRNA genes are commonly analyzed to determine microbial diversity. However, because sequences within a genus are highly similar, strain- or species-specific identification is often uncertain. Because there are no established functions of hypervariable regions, residue variations within them are often evenly weighted when making taxonomic comparisons.

    "abstract": "Type III secretion systems are bacterial nanomachines specialized in protein delivery into target eukaryotic cells. The structural and functional complexity of these machines demand highly coordinated mechanisms for their assembly and operation. The sorting platform is a critical component of type III secretion machines that ensures the timely engagement and secretion of proteins destined to travel this export pathway. However, the mechanisms that lead to the assembly of this multi-component structure have not been elucidated. Herein, employing structure modeling and an extensive in vivo crosslinking strategy, we provide a detailed inter-subunit-contact survey of the entire sorting platform complex. Using the identified crosslinks as signatures for pairwise inter-subunit interactions in combination with systematic genetic deletions, we mapped the assembly process of this unique bacterial structure. Insights generated by this study could serve as the bases for the development of anti-virulence strategies to combat several medically important bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "PTCHD1 has been implicated in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and/or intellectual disability, where copy number variant losses or loss-of-function coding mutations segregate with disease in an X-linked recessive fashion. Missense variants of PTCHD1 have also been reported in patients. However, the significance of these mutations remains undetermined since the activities, subcellular localization and regulation of the PTCHD1 protein are currently unknown. This paucity of data concerning PTCHD1 prevents the effective evaluation of sequence variants identified during diagnostic screening. Here, we characterize PTCHD1 protein binding partners, extending previously reported interactions with postsynaptic scaffolding protein, SAP102. Six rare missense variants of PTCHD1 were also identified from patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. After modelling these variants on a hypothetical three-dimensional structure of PTCHD1, based on the solved structure of NPC1, PTCHD1 variants harboring these mutations were assessed for protein stability, post-translational processing and protein trafficking. We show here that wild-type PTCHD1 post-translational modification includes complex N-glycosylation and that specific mutant proteins disrupt normal N-link glycosylation processing. However, regardless of their processing, these mutants still localized to PSD95-containing dendritic processes and remained competent for complexing SAP102.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) is a significant foodborne pathogen and a common cause of intestinal diseases in both animals and humans. Altogether, 186 isolates were obtained from humans (n = 147), animals (n = 25), and food (n = 14), comprising 174 type A strains (93.55%), 11 type F strains (5.91%), and one type D strain (0.54%); and were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Additionally, some specific ST complexes were analyzed by cgMLST and cgSNP to investigate genetic relatedness. MLST indicated the most prevalent STs of C. perfringens of human and animal origin were as follows: ST221 (5/147), ST62 (4/147), ST408 (4/147), and ST493 (4/147) were predominant in humans, while ST479 (5/25) was the major type in animals. Within the same ST complex, genetically unrelated relationships or potential clustering/transmission events were further recognized by cgMLST and cgSNP, illustrating that these two methods are valuable in defining outbreaks and transmission events. All tested isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and meropenem. The rates of resistance to metronidazole, penicillin, cefoxitin, moxifloxacin, and clindamycin were low (metronidazole: 1.08%; penicillin: 9.68%; cefoxitin: 0.54%; moxifloxacin: 6.45%; and chloramphenicol: 3.76%). Interestingly, 49.66% of human origin were clindamycin-resistant, and 18.2% were penicillin-insensitive. Importantly, the portion of MDR isolates was significantly lower than in previous reports. The study provides an overview of the epidemiological characteristics of C. perfringens with different origins and hosts in China. C. perfringens demonstrated remarkable genetic diversity and distinct molecular features compared to antibiotic-resistance profiles from other studies.\n\nIMPORTANCEC. perfringens is one of the most common bacterial causes of foodborne illness globally, responsible for several food-poisoning outbreaks each year. This study provides an overview of C. perfringens isolates from different hosts and regions in China according to MLST, antibiotic-resistance characters, cgMLST, and cgSNP analyses, showing high genetic diversity and identifying potential clustering and transmission events. The antimicrobial profile in this study was distinct from that of a previous report with a much lower MDR rate, indicating that C. perfringens in China needs further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) hyperactivity causes heart injury and arrhythmias--two major sources of mortality worldwide. Despite proven benefits of CaMKII inhibition in numerous preclinical models of heart disease, translation of CaMKII antagonists into humans has been stymied by low potency, toxicity, and an enduring concern for adverse effects on cognition due to an established role of CaMKII in learning and memory. To address these challenges, we asked if any clinically approved drugs, developed for other purposes, were potent CaMKII inhibitors. For this, we engineered a novel fluorescent biosensor, CaMKAR (CaMKII Activity Reporter), which features superior sensitivity, kinetics, and tractability for high throughput screening. Using this tool, we carried a drug repurposing screen (4,475 compounds in clinical use) in human cells expressing autonomously active CaMKII. This yielded five previously unrecognized CaMKII inhibitors with clinically relevant potency: ruxolitinib, baricitinib, silmitasertib, crenolanib, and abemaciclib. Standout among these, ruxolitinib, an orally bioavailable and U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication, inhibited CaMKII in cultured cardiomyocytes and in mice at concentrations equivalent to human doses. 10-minute treatment in mice was sufficient to prevent atrial fibrillation-- the most common clinical arrhythmia. At cardioprotective doses, ruxolitinib-treated mice behaved normally in established cognitive assays. Our results suggest that human CaMKII inhibition is feasible and safe, and support prompt clinical investigation of ruxolitinib for cardiac indications.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe developed a CaMKII biosensor suitable for high throughput screening and identified ruxolitinib as a CaMKII inhibitor capable of rescuing cardiac arrhythmia.",

    "abstract": "To maintain genome integrity, cells must avoid DNA damage by ensuring the accurate duplication of the genome and by having efficient repair and signaling systems that counteract the genome-destabilizing potential of DNA lesions. To uncover genes and pathways that suppress DNA damage in human cells, we undertook genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens that monitored the levels of DNA damage in the absence or presence of DNA replication stress. We identified 160 genes in RKO cells whose mutation caused high levels of DNA damage in the absence of exogenous genotoxic treatment. This list was highly enriched in essential genes, highlighting the importance of genomic integrity for cellular fitness. Furthermore, the majority of these 160 genes are involved in a limited set of biological processes related to DNA replication and repair, nucleotide biosynthesis, RNA metabolism and iron sulfur cluster biogenesis, suggesting that genome integrity may be insulated from a wide range of cellular processes. Among the many genes identified and validated in this study, we discovered that GNB1L, a schizophrenia/autism-susceptibility gene implicated in 22q11.2 syndrome, protects cells from replication catastrophe promoted by mild DNA replication stress. We show that GNB1L is involved in the biogenesis of ATR and related phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) through its interaction with the TTT co-chaperone complex. These results implicate PIKK biogenesis as a potential root cause for the neuropsychiatric phenotypes associated with 22q11.2 syndrome. The phenotypic mapping of genes that suppress DNA damage in human cells therefore provides a powerful approach to probe genome maintenance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Purple phototrophic bacteria use a core  photosystem consisting of light harvesting antenna complex 1 (LH1) surrounding the reaction centre (RC), which primarily absorbs far-red-near-infrared light and converts it to chemical energy. Species in the Blastochloris genus, which are able to use light >1000nm for photosynthesis, use bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) b rather than the more common BChl a as their major photopigment, and also uniquely assemble LH1 with an additional polypeptide subunit, LH1{gamma}, encoded by multiple open reading frames in their genomes. In order to assign a role to this subunit, we deleted the four LH1{gamma}-encoding genes in the model Blastochloris viridis. Interestingly, growth under halogen bulbs routinely used for cultivation of anoxygenic phototrophs yielded cells displaying an absorption maximum of 825 nm, similar to that of the RC complex without LH1, but growth under white light from fluorescent bulbs yielded cells with an absorption maximum at 972 nm. HPLC analysis of pigment composition and sucrose density gradient fractionation demonstrate that the mutant grown in white light assembles RC-LH1, albeit with an absorption maximum blue-shifted by 46 nm relative to the WT complex. Wavelengths between 900-1000 nm transmit poorly through the atmosphere due to strong absorption by water, thus our results provide an evolutionary rationale for the incorporation of the {gamma} subunit into the LH1 ring; this polypeptide red-shifts the absorption maximum of the complex to a range of the spectrum where the photons are of lower energy but are more abundant. Finally, we transformed the mutant with plasmids carrying genes encoding natural LH1{gamma} variants and demonstrate that the polypeptide found in the WT complex red-shifts absorption back to 1018 nm, but incorporation of a distantly-related variant results in only a moderate red-shift. This result suggests that tuning the absorption maximum of this organism is possible, and may permit light capture past the current low-energy limit of natural photosynthesis.",

Various reports have posited a role for MT-3 in regulating the actin cytoskeleton by promoting the assembly of actin filaments. We generated purified, recombinant mouse MT-3 of known metal compositions, either with zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), or copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) bound. None of these forms of MT-3 accelerated actin filament polymerization in vitro, either with or without the actin binding protein profilin. Furthermore, using a co-sedimentation assay, we did not observe Zn-bound MT-3 in complex with actin filaments. Cu2+ ions on their own induced rapid actin polymerization, an effect that we attribute to filament fragmentation. This effect of Cu2+ is reversed by adding either EGTA or Zn-bound MT-3, indicating that either molecule can chelate Cu2+ from actin. Altogether, our data indicate that recombinant MT-3 does not directly bind actin but it does attenuate the Cu-induced fragmentation of actin filaments.",

This challenge becomes more difficult as synthetic systems become more complex by incorporating additional genes or strains. Here we demonstrate that circuit dynamics can be tuned in synthetic consortia through the manipulation of strain fractions within the community. To do this, we constructed a microbial consortium comprised of three strains of engineered Escherichia coli that, when co-cultured, use homoserine lactone (HSL) mediated intercellular signaling to create a multi-strain incoherent type-1 feedforward loop (I1-FFL). Like naturally occurring I1-FFL motifs in gene networks, this engineered microbial consortium acts as a pulse generator of gene expression. We demonstrated that the amplitude of the pulse can be easily tuned by adjusting the relative population fractions of the strains. We created a mathematical model for the temporal dynamics of the microbial consortium and, using this model, identified population fractions that produced desired pulse characteristics. Our work demonstrates that intercellular gene circuits can be effectively tuned simply by adjusting the starting fractions of each strain type.",

    "abstract": "Basigin is an essential host receptor for invasion of Plasmodium falciparum into human erythrocytes, interacting with parasite surface protein PfRH5. PfRH5 is a leading blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate and a target of growth-inhibitory antibodies. However, basigin is not alone on the erythrocyte surface. Instead, we show that it is exclusively found in one of two macromolecular complexes, bound predominantly to either plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1/4, PMCA1/4, or monocarboxylate transporter 1, MCT1. PfRH5 binds to either of these complexes with a higher affinity than to isolated basigin ectodomain, making it likely that these are the physiological targets of PfRH5. PMCA-mediated Ca2+ export is not affected by PfRH5, ruling this out as the mechanism underlying changes in calcium flux at the interface between an erythrocyte and the invading parasite. However, our studies rationalise the function of the most effective growth inhibitory antibodies targeting PfRH5. While these antibodies do not reduce the binding of PfRH5 to monomeric basigin, they do reduce its binding to basigin-PMCA and basigin-MCT complexes. This indicates that the most effective PfRH5-targeting antibodies inhibit growth by sterically blocking the essential interaction of PfRH5 with basigin in its physiological context.",

We identified molecules with improved potency and reduced cytotoxicity. However, molecules did not appear to target LepB directly and did not inhibit protein secretion. Key compounds showed good permeability, low protein binding, and lack of CYP inhibition, but metabolic stability was poor with short half-lives. The seed molecule showed good bactericidal activity against both replicating and non-replicating bacteria, as well as potency against intracellular M. tuberculosis in murine macrophages.

    "abstract": "Severe outbreaks and deaths have been linked to the emergence and global spread of fluoroquinolone-resistant Clostridioides difficile over the past two decades. At the same time, metronidazole, a nitro-containing antibiotic, has shown decreasing clinical efficacy in treating C. difficile infection (CDI). Most metronidazole-resistant C. difficile exhibit an unusual resistance phenotype that can only be detected in susceptibility tests utilizing molecularly intact heme. Here we describe the mechanism underlying this trait, which we discovered using molecular genetics, phylogenetics, and population analyses. Most metronidazole-resistant strains evolved a T to G mutation, we term PnimBG, in the -10 regulatory promoter of the 5-nitroimidazole reductase nimB, resulting in the gene being constitutively transcribed. Silencing or deleting nimB eliminated metronidazole resistance. We identified the protein as a heme-dependent nitroreductase that degraded nitro-drugs to an amine lacking antimicrobial activity. We further discovered that the metronidazole-resistant PnimBGmutation was strongly associated with the Thr82Ile substitution conferring fluoroquinolone resistance in epidemic strains. Re-analysis of published genomes from global isolates confirmed that all but one encoding PnimBG also carried the Thr82Ile mutation. Our findings suggest that fluoroquinolone and metronidazole resistance co-mediated the pandemic of healthcare-associated C. difficile that are associated with poorer treatment outcomes in CDI patients receiving metronidazole.",

ONCs can be obtained from repeated biopsies in a longitudinal study, providing mechanistic insight associated with dynamic changes along the disease trajectory and treatment response. Nevertheless, molecular characterization of nasal biopsied cells/tissue has been insufficient. Taking advantage of recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies at the single-cell resolution and related rich public databases, we aimed to define the neuronal characteristics of ONCs, their homogeneity, and their utility. We conducted single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, analyzed and compared the data with multiple public datasets. We observed that the molecular signatures of ONCs are similar to those of neurons, distinct from major glial cells. The signatures of ONCs resemble those of developing neurons and share features of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal and cingulate cortex. The high homogeneity of ONCs is advantageous in pharmacological, functional, and protein studies. Together, the present data solidify the utility of ONCs in studying molecular mechanisms and exploring objective biomarkers for brain disorders. The ONCs may also be useful in studying the potential link between the olfactory epithelium impairment and the resultant mental dysfunction elicited by SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTo study dynamic changes and underlying mechanisms along disease trajectory and treatment response in neuropsychiatric disorders, olfactory neuronal cells (ONCs) enriched from nasal biopsied tissue may provide a crucial tool. Because ONCs can be obtained from repeated biopsies in a longitudinal study, this tool has been believed to be useful and complementary to postmortem brains and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Nevertheless, molecular characterization of nasal biopsied cells/tissue has been insufficient, which hampers a wider use of this resource. Taking advantage of recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies at the single-cell resolution and related rich public databases, the present study defines the neuronal characteristics of ONCs, their homogeneity, and their unique utility for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Collagen fibres are the main constituent of the extracellular matrix, and fulfil an important role in the structural stability of living multicellular organisms. An open question is how collagen absorbs pulling forces, and if the applied forces are strong enough to break bonds, what mechanisms underlie this process. As experimental studies on this topic are challenging, simulations are an important tool to further our understanding of these mechanisms. Here, we present pulling simulations of collagen triple helices, revealing the molecular mechanisms induced by tensile stress. At lower forces, pulling alters the configuration of proline residues leading to an effective absorption of applied stress. When forces are strong enough to introduce bond ruptures, these are located preferentially in X-position residues. Reduced backbone flexibility, for example through mutations or cross linking, weakens tensile resistance, leading to localised ruptures around these perturbations. In fibre-like segments, a significant overrepresentation of ruptures in proline residues compared to amino acid contents is observed. This study confirms the important role of proline in the structural stability of collagen, and adds detailed insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this observation.",

    "abstract": "Continuous directed evolution (CDE) is a powerful tool for enzyme engineering due to the depth and scale of evolutionary search that it enables. If suitably controlled and calibrated, CDE could be widely applied in plant breeding and biotechnology to improve plant enzymes ex planta. We tested this concept by evolving Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase (AtADT2) for resistance to feedback inhibition. We used an Escherichia coli platform with a phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway reconfigured ( plantized) to mimic the plant pathway, a T7RNA polymerase-base deaminase hypermutation system (eMutaT7), and 4-fluorophenylalanine as selective agent. Selection schemes were pre-validated using a known feedback-resistant AtADT2 variant. We obtained variants that had 4-fluorophenylalanine resistance at least matching the known variant and that carried mutations in the ACT domain responsible for feedback inhibition. We conclude that ex planta CDE of plant enzymes in a microbial platform is a viable way to tailor characteristics that involve interaction with small molecules.",

    "abstract": "MotivationConstraint-based models (CBMs) are used to study the metabolic networks of organisms ranging from microbes to multicellular eukaryotes. Published CBMs are usually generic rather than context-specific, meaning that they do not capture metabolic differences between cell types, tissues, environments, or other conditions. However, only a subset of reactions in a model are likely to be active in any given context, and several methods have therefore been developed to extract context-specific models from generic CBMs through integration of omics data.\n\nResultsWe tested the ability of six model extraction methods (MEMs) to create functionally accurate context-specific models of Atlantic salmon using a generic CBM (SALARECON) and liver transcriptomics data from contexts differing in water salinity (life stage) and dietary lipids. Reaction contents and metabolic task feasibility predictions of context-specific CBMs were mainly determined by the MEM that was used, but life stage explained significant variance in both contents and predictions for some MEMs. Three MEMs clearly outperformed the others in terms of their ability to capture context-specific metabolic activities inferred directly from the data, and one of these (GIMME) was much faster than the others. Context-specific versions of SALARECON consistently outperformed the generic version, showing that context-specific modeling captures more realistic representations of Atlantic salmon metabolism.\n\nContactjon.vik@nmbu.no",

    "abstract": "Hepatic zonation is critical for most metabolic functions in liver. Wnt signaling plays an important role in establishing and maintaining liver zonation. Yet, the anatomic expression of Wnt signaling components, including all 10 Frizzled receptors (Fzds), has not been characterized in adult liver. To address this, we quantitatively mapped the spatial expression of Wnt/Fzd pathway components in adult mouse liver via multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization. While all 10 Fzds are expressed within a metabolic unit, Fzds 1, 4, and 6 are the highest expressed. Though the majority of Wnt signaling occurs in zone 3, expression of most Fzds is not zonated. In contrast, Fzd6 is preferentially expressed in zone 1. We also discovered that Wnt2 and Wnt9b expression is highly zonated and primarily found in zone 3. Therefore, our results suggest that zonated Wnt expression is critical for zonation maintenance in healthy adult liver. Finally, we showed that Fzds and Wnts are not uniformly expressed by all hepatic cell types. Rather, there is broad distribution among both hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, including endothelial cells. Overall, our establishment of a definitive mRNA expression atlas of Wnt/Fzd pathway components opens the door to future functional characterization in healthy and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Piezo1 is a stretch-gated ion channel required for mechanosensation in many organ systems. Recent provocative findings describe a new role for Piezo1 in the gut, suggesting that it is a sensor of microbial single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) rather than mechanical force. If true, this would redefine the scope of Piezo biology. Here, we sought to replicate the central finding that fecal ssRNA is a natural agonist of Piezo1. While we observed that fecal extracts and ssRNA stimulate calcium influx in certain cell lines, this response was independent of Piezo1. Additionally, sterilized dietary extracts devoid of gut biome RNA showed similar cell line-specific stimulatory activity to fecal extracts. Together, our data highlight potential confounds inherent to gut-derived extracts, exclude Piezo1 as a receptor for ssRNA in the gut, and support a dedicated role for Piezo channels in mechanosensing.",

    "abstract": "CYT-19 is a DEAD-box protein whose ATP-dependent helicase activity facilitates the folding of group I introns in precursor RNA (pre-RNA) of Neurospora crassa. In the process they consume a substantial amount of ATP. While much of the mechanistic insights into CYT-19 activity has been gained through the studies on the folding of Tetrahymena group I intron ribozyme, the more biologically relevant issue, namely the effect of CYT-19 on the self-splicing of pre-RNA, remains largely unexplored. Here, we employ a kinetic network model, based on the generalized iterative annealing mechanism, to investigate the relation between CYT-19 activity, rate of ribozyme folding, and the kinetics of the self-splicing reaction. The network rate parameters are extracted by analyzing the recent biochemical data for CYT-19-facilitated folding of T. ribozyme. We then build extended models to explore the metabolism of pre-RNA. We show that the timescales of chaperone-mediated folding of group I ribozyme and self-splicing reaction compete with each other. As a consequence, in order to maximize the self-splicing yield of group I introns in pre-RNA, the chaperone activity must be sufficiently large to unfold the misfolded structures, but not too large to unfold the native structures prior to the self-splicing event. We discover that despite the promiscuous action on structured RNAs, the helicase activity of CYT-19 on group I ribozyme gives rise to self-splicing yields that are close to the maximum.\n\nSignificance StatementIn cells, RNA chaperones assist misfolding-prone ribozymes to fold correctly to carry out its biological function. CYT-19 is an ATP-consuming RNA chaperone that accelerates the production of native group I intron ribozyme by partially unfolding the kinetically trapped structures. Using the theoretical framework based on the iterative annealing mechanism, we establish that to maximize the processing of pre-RNA, an optimal balance should exist between the timescales of self-splicing activity and CYT-19-mediated production of the native ribozyme. Remarkably, the activity of CYT-19 has been optimized to unfold the misfolded structures but is not so high that it disrupts the native ribozyme, which ensures that the yield of the self-splicing reaction is maximized in a biologically relevant time scale.",
