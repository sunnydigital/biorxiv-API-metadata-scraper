    "abstract": "MotivationBreast cancer, the most common cancer in women, is characterized by high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the development and progression of breast cancer. Despite this, no database exists primarily for lncRNAs associated with only breast cancer.\n\nResultsWe developed BCLncRDB, a manually curated, comprehensive database of lncRNAs associated with breast cancer. For this, we collected, processed, and analyzed data on breast cancer-associated lncRNAs from different sources, including published literature and TCGA. Currently, our database contains 5,279 unique breast cancer-lncRNA associations. It has the following features: (I) Differentially expressed and methylated lncRNAs, (II) Stage and subtype-specific lncRNAs, and (III) Drugs, Subcellular localization, Sequence, and Chromosome information. Thus, the BCLncRDB provides a dedicated platform for exploring breast cancer-related lncRNAs to advance and support the ongoing research on this disease.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe database BCLncRDB is publicly available for use at http://sls.uohyd.ac.in/new/bclncrdb.\n\nContactvaibhav@uohyd.ac.in",

    "abstract": "To survive and proliferate in diverse environments with varying climate and nutrient availability, plants modulate their metabolism. Achieving a balance between carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) use such that growth and defense mechanisms can be appropriately controlled is critical for plant fitness. The identification of factors that regulate C/N utilization in plants can make a significant contribution to optimization of plant health. Here we show that pyridox(am)ine 5-phosphate oxidase (PDX3), which regulates vitamin B6 homeostasis, influences C/N balance. The B6 vitamer imbalance resulting from loss of PDX3 leads to over-accumulation of nitrogenous compounds. A combination of increased glutamate dehydrogenase activity, impairment in the photorespiratory cycle and inappropriate use of endogenous ammonium fuel the metabolic imbalance. Growth at elevated CO2 levels further exacerbates the pdx3 phenotypes. Interestingly, serine supplementation rescues growth under high CO2 likely bypassing the phosphorylated pathway of biosynthesis suggesting that this amino acid is an important commodity. We show that PDX3 function appears dispensable upon thermomorphogenesis, a condition that favors C metabolism. Furthermore, while a low ammonium to nitrate ratio likely accounts for overstimulation of salicylic acid (SA) defense responses in pdx3 lines that compromises growth, a basal level of SA protects against loss of PDX3 biochemical function. Overall, the study highlights environmental scenarios where vitamin B6 homeostasis, as managed by the salvage pathway enzyme PDX3, is critical and provides insight into how plants reprogram their metabolism under such conditions.",

    "abstract": "In the rat primary gustatory cortex (GC), a subregion of the larger insular cortex, neurons display time-varying neural responses to gustatory stimuli. GC taste responses are dramatically reduced following inactivation of the gustatory thalamus, the parvicellular region of the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus (VPMpc). Pharmacological inactivation of VPMpc also has a profound effect on GC spontaneous activity. This indicates that the projection from VPMpc plays a crucial role in GC taste processing as well as in the control of its state. How VPMpc afferents engage GC circuits and drive neuronal ensembles to effectively code tastant identity, as well as modulate the overall state of the GC network, remains unclear. To investigate the synaptic properties and organization of VPMpc afferents in GC, we employed a circuit-breaking optogenetic approach, stimulating VPMpc terminal fields while performing whole-cell patch clamp recordings from GC neurons in rat acute slices. Informed by previous studies of thalamocortical inputs to other sensory cortices, we hypothesized that VPMpc-GC synapses have laminar- and cell-specific properties that gate sensory input, conferring computationally flexibility to how taste information is processed in GC. We found that VPMpc-GC synapses are strongly gated by the activity regime of VPMpc afferents, as well as by feedforward and feedback inhibition onto VPMpc terminals. These results provide novel insight into the circuit underpinning of GC responsiveness to incoming thalamocortical activity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe report that the input from the primary taste thalamus to the primary gustatory cortex (GC) shows distinct properties compared to primary thalamocortical synapses onto other sensory areas. VPMpc afferents in GC make synapses with excitatory neurons distributed across all cortical layers and display frequency-dependent short-term plasticity to repetitive stimulation, thus they do not fit the classic distinction between drivers and modulators typical of other sensory thalamocortical circuits. Feedforward inhibition gates thalamocortical activation and provides local corticothalamic feedback via presynaptic ionotropic and metabotropic GABA receptors. The connectivity and inhibitory control of thalamocortical synapses support the time-varying response dynamics to taste stimuli observed in GC neurons in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Low-frequency oscillations shape how neurons sample their synaptic inputs, hence regulating information exchange among neural circuits. In the hippocampus, theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) enable the temporal organization of cortical inputs, resulting in a phase code. However, the advantages of the specific theta band over other frequency ranges remain unclear. It is possible that this specific frequency range is optimizing a trade-off between information throughput and biophysical constraints of the neuronal substrate. To test this hypothesis, we analyze a physiologically constrained model of the rodent hippocampus comprising stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire neurons driven by oscillations. By estimating the information rate of the phase code for a range of noise and frequency levels, we identify a trade-off between sampling frequency and coding precision. We observe that, under physiological noise levels, theta-band oscillations optimize the speed-precision trade-off, maximizing information rate. Further, we demonstrate that theta optimizes this trade-off throughout the entire dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus with its pronounced gradients of several physiological properties. In addition, we find that maintaining an optimal information rate relies on the concurrent modulation of both frequency and amplitude, hence explaining the locomotion speed-dependent modulations of the hippocampal theta oscillation that are observed in rodents and humans. Overall, our results suggest that low-frequency oscillations are adapted to maximize the information rate of neural sampling given the temporal and biophysical constraints under which neural circuits operate.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the hippocampus, a prominent oscillation in the theta band (4-8 Hz) allows single neurons to rhythmically sample and represent the ever-changing input signals coming from the cortex. However, it remains unclear why this hippocampal rhythm lies within the theta band. Here, we show that neurons that use oscillations to sample noisy input signals face a trade-off between their sampling speed (i.e., the frequency) and their coding precision (i.e., the accuracy of the representation). We find that, for simulated hippocampal neurons, this trade-off is optimized precisely within the theta band. Importantly, our framework allows us to explain other fundamental properties of the hippocampus while having implications for other brain areas that might use similar sampling mechanisms. In summary, we provide an explanation as to why oscillations in the hippocampus are confined within the theta band, and lay down the foundations to study how properties of single neurons determine the optimal sampling frequencies in a particular neural circuit.",

    "abstract": "Despite being twice as likely to get Alzheimers disease (AD), African Americans have been grossly underrepresented in AD research. While emerging evidence indicates that African Americans with AD have lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Tau compared to Caucasians, other differences in AD CSF biomarkers have not been fully elucidated. Here, we performed unbiased proteomic profiling of CSF from African Americans and Caucasians with and without AD to identify both common and divergent AD CSF biomarkers. Multiplex tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) quantified 1,840 proteins from 105 control and 98 AD patients of which 100 identified as Caucasian while 103 identified as African American. Consistent with previous findings, the increase of Tau levels in AD was greater in Caucasians than in African Americans by both immunoassay and TMT-MS measurements. Network analysis organized the CSF proteome into 14 modules associated with brain cell-types and biological pathways. CSF modules which included 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAZ and YWHAG), demonstrated equivalent disease-related elevations in both African Americans and Caucasians with AD, whereas other modules demonstrated more profound disease changes within race. Modules enriched with proteins involved with glycolysis and neuronal/cytoskeletal proteins, including Tau, were more increased in Caucasians than in African Americans with AD. In contrast, a module enriched with synaptic proteins including VGF, SCG2, and NPTX2 was significantly lower in African Americans than Caucasians with AD. Using a targeted proteomic approach (selected reaction monitoring) followed by a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis we measured levels of VGF, SCG2, and NPTX2, which were significantly better at classifying African Americans than Caucasians with AD. Collectively, our findings provide insight into additional protein biomarkers and pathways reflecting underlying brain pathology that are shared or differ by race.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) most often leads to permanent paralysis due to the inability of axons to regenerate in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In the past, we have shown that mast cells (MCs) improve the functional outcome after SCI by suppressing scar tissue formation at the lesion site via mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP6). In this study, we investigated whether recombinant mMCP6 can be used therapeutically to improve the functional outcome after SCI. Therefore, we applied mMCP6 locally via an intrathecal catheter in the subacute phase after a spinal cord hemisection injury in mice. Our findings showed that hind limb motor function was significantly improved in mice that received recombinant mMCP6 compared to the vehicle-treated group. In contrast to our previous findings in mMCP6 knockout mice, the lesion size and expression levels of the scar components fibronectin, laminin, and axon-growth-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were not affected by the treatment with recombinant mMCP6. Surprisingly, no difference in infiltration of CD4+ T cells and reactivity of Iba-1+ microglia/macrophages at the lesion site was observed between the mMCP6-treated mice and control mice. Additionally, local protein levels of the pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN{gamma}, and MCP-1 were comparable between the two treatment groups, indicating that locally applied mMCP6 did not affect inflammatory processes after injury. However, the increase in locomotor performance in mMCP6-treated mice was accompanied by reduced demyelination and astrogliosis in the perilesional area after SCI. Consistently, we found that TNF-a/IL-1B-astrocyte activation was decreased, and that oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation was increased after recombinant mMCP6 treatment in vitro. Mechanistically, this suggests effects of mMCP6 on reducing astrogliosis and improving (re)myelination in the spinal cord after injury. In conclusion, these data show for the first time that recombinant mMCP6 is therapeutically active in enhancing recovery after SCI.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian visual system can be broadly divided into two functional processing pathways: a dorsal stream supporting visually and spatially guided actions, and a ventral stream enabling object recognition. In rodents, the majority of visual signaling in the dorsal stream is transmitted to frontal motor cortices via extrastriate visual areas surrounding V1, but exactly where and to what extent V1 feeds into motor-projecting visual regions is not well known. To address this we employed a dual labeling strategy in male and female mice in which efferent projections from V1 were labeled anterogradely, and motor-projecting neurons in higher visual areas were labeled with retrogradely traveling adeno-associated virus (rAAV-retro) injected in M2. In flattened sections of dorsal cortex, the most pronounced colocalization V1 output and M2 input occurred in extrastriate areas AM, PM, RL and AL. Coronal sections further showed that neurons in both superficial and deep layers in these regions project to M2, but high resolution volumetric reconstructions revealed that the vast majority of putative synaptic contacts from V1 onto M2-projecting neurons occurred in layer 2/3. These findings support the existence of a dorsal processing stream in the mouse visual system, where visual signals reach motor cortex largely via feedforward projections in anteriorly and medially located extrastriate areas.\n\nSignificance StatementVisually guided motor behavior depends on the long-distance relay of signals from visual cortex to frontal motor cortices, but the neuroanatomical connections linking visual and motor systems in rodents are not fully charted. Here, we characterized such pathways by injecting anterograde tracers in primary visual cortex (V1) and retrogradely traveling virus in motor cortex (M2), and visualizing where the projections overlapped. We found preferential colocalization of V1 output and M2-projecting neurons in anteriorly- and medially-located higher visual areas. 3D volumetric reconstructions further showed high rates of putative synaptic connections mainly in superficial layers. Thus, visual signals in the mouse dorsal visual stream reach motor areas at least in part via superficial, feedforward connections in a subset of extrastriate areas.",

    "abstract": "Enveloped virus entry requires fusion of the viral envelope with a host cell membrane. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) entry is mediated by a set of glycoproteins that interact to trigger the viral fusion protein glycoprotein B (gB). In the current model, receptor-binding by gD signals a gH/gL heterodimer to trigger a refolding event in gB that fuses the membranes. To explore functional interactions between gB and gH/gL, we used a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate two HSV-1 mutants that show a small plaque phenotype due to changes in gB. We passaged the viruses to select for restoration of plaque size and analyzed second-site mutations that arose in gH. HSV-1 gB was replaced either by gB from saimiriine herpesvirus type 1 (SaHV-1) or by a mutant form of HSV-1 gB with three alanine substitutions in domain V (gB3A). To shift the selective pressure away from gB, the gB3A virus was passaged in cells expressing gB3A. Sequencing of passaged viruses identified two interesting mutations in gH, including gH-H789 in domain IV and gH-S830N in the cytoplasmic tail (CT). Characterization of these gH mutations indicated they are responsible for the enhanced plaque size. Rather than being globally hyperfusogenic, both gH mutations partially rescued function of the specific gB version present during their selection. These sites may represent functional interaction sites on gH/gL for gB. gH-H789 may alter the positioning of a membrane-proximal flap in the gH ectodomain, whereas gH-S830 may contribute to an interaction between the gB and gH CTs.\n\nIMPORTANCEEnveloped viruses enter cells by fusing their envelope with the host cell membrane. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) entry requires the coordinated interaction of several viral glycoproteins, including gH/gL and gB. gH/gL and gB are essential for virus replication and both proteins are targets of neutralizing antibodies. gB fuses the membranes after being activated by gH/gL, but the details of how gH/gL activates gB are not known. This study examined the gH/gL-gB interaction using HSV-1 mutants that displayed reduced virus entry due to changes in gB. The mutant viruses were grown over time to select for additional mutations that could partially restore entry. Two mutations in gH (H789Y and S830N) were identified. The positions of the mutations in gH/gL may represent sites that contribute to gB activation during virus entry.",

Therefore, this study investigated the microbial composition and patterns of gene expression in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis.

Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria represented the dominant phyla, whereas Fusobacteria, Spirochaetes and Synergistetes were among the non-dominant phyla. At species level, the microbiome was dominated by Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobes. In particular, Prevotella spp. and Olsenella uli were more abundant in primary than in secondary infections. Transcripts encoding moonlighting proteins were abundant, including glycolytic proteins, translational elongation factors, chaperonin, and heat shock proteins. Fusobacterium was highly active in primary infections, showing upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, responses to oxidative stress and resistance to antibiotics, especially tetracycline. In addition, other members of the community expressed high numbers of antimicrobial resistance genes. Overall, metatranscriptomics revealed the expression of putative virulence factors and the activity of potential endodontic pathogens, represented mainly by obligate anaerobes.

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota is involved in the occurrence and progression of urinary system diseases such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the mechanism of how alteration of gut metagenome promotes ccRCC remains unclear. Here we aim to elucidate the association of specific gut bacteria and their metabolites with ccRCC. In a pilot case-control study among 30 ccRCC patients and 30 healthy controls, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing were analyzed from fecal samples collected prior to surgery or hospitalization. Alpha diversity and beta diversity analysis of the gut microbiota were performed, and differential taxa were identified by multivariate statistics. Meanwhile, serum metabolism was measured by UHPLC-MS, and differential genes were identified based on the TCGA database. Random Forests revealed the relative abundances of 20 species differed significantly between the RCC group and the Control group, among which 9 species, such as Desulfovibrionaceae, were enriched in the RCC group, and 11 species, such as four kinds of Lactobacillus, were less abundant. Concomitantly, serum level of taurine, which was considered to be consumed by Desulfovibrionaceae and released by Lactobacillus, has decreased in the RCC group. In addition, macrophage-related genes such as Gabbr1 was upregulated in ccRCC patients from our results.\n\nIMPORTANCETo our knowledge, few studies investigate the correlation of gut microbiota and ccRCC tumorigenesis. Overall, our sequencing data suggest that changes in the composition of specific gut microbiota, especially Lactobacillus and Desulfovibrionaceae, may be involved in ccRCC. Numerous serum metabolites, for example, taurine, which were modified in concert with dysregulation of gut microbiota, were associated with metabolic status during ccRCC development. Furthermore, through comparative analysis of clinical indicators, we found that gut dysbiosis could potentially reshape systemic inflammation, which participated in ccRCC tumorigenesis and we performed bioinformatics analysis to draw this conclusion. In Summary, it could be concluded from our study that the reduction of protective bacteria Lactobacillus, proliferation of sulfide-degrading bacteria Desulfovibrionaceae, reduction of taurine, and enrichment of macrophage related genes might be the risk predictors of ccRCC.",

    "abstract": "Over a three-month period, we monitored the population of extended-spectrum {beta}-lactam-resistant Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) associated with the patients, staff and environment of an intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangzhou, China. Thirty-four clinical isolates were obtained from the same hospital 12 months later. A total of 165 isolates were characterised and whole-genome sequenced, with 24 isolates subjected to long-read sequencing. The diverse population included representatives of 59 different sequence types (STs). ICU patient and environmental isolates were largely distinct from staff isolates and clinical isolates. We observed five instances of highly similar isolates (0-13 core-gene SNPs) being obtained from different patients or bed unit environments. ESBL resistance in this collection was largely conferred by blaCTX-M genes, which were found in 96.4% of all isolates. The contexts of blaCTX-M genes were diverse, situated in multiple chromosomal positions and in various plasmids. We identified blaCTX-M-bearing plasmid lineages that were present in multiple STs across the surveillance, staff and clinical collections. Closer examination of ISEcp1-blaCTX-M transposition units shed light on the dynamics of their transmission, with evidence for the acquisition of chromosomal copies of blaCTX-M genes from specific plasmid lineages, and for the movement of blaCTX-M-55 from a ST1193 chromosome to a small mobilisable plasmid. A carbapenem-resistant ST167 strain isolated from a patient that had been treated with meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam contained seven copies of blaCMY-146, which appears to have been amplified by IS1. Our data revealed limited persistence and movement of ESBL-EC strains in the ICU environment, but we observed circulating plasmid lineages playing an essential and ongoing role in shaping the cephalosporin-resistance landscape in the population examined.\n\nImpact statementESBL resistance significantly impacts clinical management of E. coli infections in hospitals globally. It is important to understand the structures of ESBL-EC populations carried by hospital patients and staff, their capacity to persist in hospital environments, and the dynamics of mobile genes that drive the spread of ESBL resistance. In our three-month study, ESBL-EC strains found in the ICU environment were strongly associated with patient carriage, but distinct from strains found in staff. However, plasmid lineages carrying blaCTX-M genes were found across the ICU populations and in a collection of clinical isolates obtained one year later. By examining their content and contexts, we have traced the recent histories of chromosomal and plasmid-borne ISEcp1-blaCTX-M transposition units in the ICU population. This allowed us to implicate specific plasmid lineages in the acquisition of chromosomal blaCTX-M genes, even when the plasmids were no longer present, and to detect recent transposition of blaCTX-M-55 from a chromosome to a mobilisable plasmid. Similar high-resolution approaches to the study of mobile genetic elements will be essential if the transmission routes associated with the spread of ESBL resistance are to be understood and subjected to interventions.\n\nData summarySequencing reads are available under NCBI BioProject accession PRJNA907549.

    "abstract": "The wild relatives of modern tomato crops are native to South America. These plants occur in habitats as different as the Andes and the Atacama Desert and are to some degree all susceptible to fungal pathogens of the genus Alternaria. Alternaria is a large genus. On tomato, several species cause early blight, leaf spot, and other diseases.\n\nWe collected Alternaria-like infection lesions from the leaves of eight wild tomato species from Chile and Peru. Using molecular barcoding markers, we characterized the pathogens. The infection lesions were caused predominantly by small-spored species of Alternaria of the section Alternaria, like A. alternata, but also by Stemphylium spp., Alternaria spp. from the section Ulocladioides, and other related species. Morphological observations and an infection assay confirmed this. Comparative genetic diversity analyses show a larger diversity in this wild system than in studies of cultivated Solanum species.\n\nAs A. alternata has been reported to be an increasing problem on cultivated tomato, investigating the evolutionary potential of this pathogen is not only interesting to scientists studying wild plant-pathosystems. It could also inform crop protection and breeding programs to be aware of potential epidemics caused by species still confined to South America.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveProliferating cancer cells shift their metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen to generate glycolytic intermediates as substrates for anabolic reactions. We hypothesise that a similar metabolic remodelling also occurs during physiological skeletal muscle hypertrophy.\n\nMethodsWe used mass spectrometry in hypertrophying muscles both in C2C12 muscle cells in vitro and plantaris mice muscle in vivo and assessed metabolomic changes and the incorporation of stable isotope [U-13C6]glucose tracer compared with non-treated controls. We also performed enzyme inhibition for further mechanistic analysis and a systematic review to align any changes in metabolomics during muscle growth with previous findings.\n\nResultsBoth our metabolomics analysis and the systematic review reveal altered metabolite concentrations in anabolic pathways such as in the pentose phosphate and serine synthesis pathway to build up biomass, as well as in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway that serves as a basis for the post-translational so-called O-linked glycosylation modification. We further demonstrated that labelled carbon from [U-13C6]glucose is increasingly incorporated into the non-essential amino acids in hypertrophying myotubes. The inhibition of the key enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) supresses muscle protein synthesis by 75% highlighting the importance of the serine pathway for maintaining muscle size.\n\nConclusionUnderstanding the mechanisms that regulates skeletal muscle mass will help in developing effective treatments against muscle weakness. Our results provide evidence for metabolic rewiring of glycolytic intermediates into anabolic pathways during muscle growth, such as in the serine synthesis and hexosamine biosynthetic pathways.",

Activation of the cellular integrated stress response (ISR) by factors such as endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to phosphorylation of eIF2 and inhibition of eIF2B GEF activity. Cytoplasmic bodies containing eIF2B subunits, termed eIF2B bodies, have been shown to alter in subunit composition and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching activity in response to the ISR. Analysis of the subunit composition of endogenous eIF2B bodies is dependent on accurate detection of each protein in a cellular context via immunocytochemistry (ICC). We describe bioinformatic techniques to optimize the ICC detection of eIF2B foci in U373 cells. The screening of commercially available primary antibodies against predicted epitopes enhanced measurements of the number, size and fluorescence intensity of eIF2B bodies. A consistent and reproducible ICC analysis of endogenous eIF2B bodies will aid characterisation of eIF2B bodies during the ISR or under disease conditions.\n\nSummaryeIF2B is a housekeeping protein and localised eIF2B foci, named eIF2B bodies, can be detected through immunocytochemistry.

Control methods such as trapping, fencing, and water exclusion have been devised to contain the spread of cane toads and reduce their ecological impact. However, implementing these interventions is expensive, and estimating the likely impact of a proposed intervention on spread at a large spatial scale, comprising one or more control methods, is challenging due to the lack of large-scale data and the computational cost of modelling a large number of toads.\nC_LIO_LITo address this challenge, we developed a multiscale model which uses individual-level data on cane toad behaviour to estimate the impact of trapping, fencing, and water exclusion when applied at scale in the Pilbara region in north-western Australia. Compared to previous work, our model allows us to explore more complex combinations and tradeoffs of control methods by utilising data sources at different scales.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that exclusion of toads from water points is the most effective method for containing the spread of cane toads, and that trapping and fencing alone are unlikely to be sufficient.

Synthesizing previous studies, we show that this confusion arises because the mechanisms driving priority and the temporal scale at which they operate differ among studies, leading to divergent outcomes in species interactions and biodiversity patterns. We suggest grouping priority effects into two functional categories based on their mechanisms: \"frequency-dependent\" priority effects that arise from positive frequency dependence, and \"trait-dependent\" priority effects that arise from time-dependent changes in interacting traits. Through easy quantification of these categories from experiments, we can construct community models representing diverse biological mechanisms and interactions with priority effects, therefore better predicting their consequences across ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the formation of numerous fluid-filled cysts that lead to progressive loss of functional nephrons. Currently, there is an unmet need for diagnostic and prognostic indicators of early stages of the disease. Metabolites were extracted from the urine of early-stage ADPKD patients (n=48) and age- and sex-matched normal controls (n=47) and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis was employed to generate a global metabolomic profile of early ADPKD for the identification of metabolic pathway alterations and discriminatory metabolites as candidates of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The global metabolomic profile exhibited alterations in steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and the urea cycle. A panel of 46 metabolite features were identified as candidate diagnostic biomarkers. Notable putative identities of candidate diagnostic biomarkers for early detection include creatinine, cAMP, dCMP, various androgens (testosterone, 5alpha-androstane-3,17,dione, trans-dehydroandrosterone), betaine aldehyde, phosphoric acid, choline, 18-hydroxycorticosterone, and cortisol. Metabolic pathways associated with variable rates of disease progression included steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism, vitamin D3 metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, sialic acid metabolism, and chondroitin sulfate and heparin sulfate degradation. A panel of 41 metabolite features were identified as candidate prognostic biomarkers. Notable putative identities of candidate prognostic biomarkers include ethanolamine, C20:4 anandamide phosphate, progesterone, various androgens (5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, androsterone, etiocholanolone, epiandrosterone), betaine aldehyde, inflammatory lipids (eicosapentaenoic acid, linoleic acid, stearolic acid), and choline. Our exploratory data support metabolic reprogramming in early ADPKD and demonstrate the ability of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based global metabolomic profiling to detect metabolic pathway alterations as new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for early diagnosis and tracking disease progression of ADPKD.",

    "abstract": "In terms of its relative frequency, lysine is a common amino acid in the human proteome. However, by bioinformatics we find hundreds of proteins that contain long and evolutionarily conserved stretches completely devoid of lysine residues. These so-called lysine deserts show a high prevalence in intrinsically disordered proteins with known or predicted functions within the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), including many E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases and UBL domain proteasome substrate shuttles, such as BAG6, RAD23A, UBQLN1 and UBQLN2. We show that introduction of lysine residues into the deserts leads to a striking increase in ubiquitylation of some of these proteins. In case of BAG6, we show that ubiquitylation is catalyzed by the E3 RNF126, while RAD23A is ubiquitylated by E6AP. Despite the elevated ubiquitylation, mutant RAD23A appears stable, but displays a partial loss of function phenotype in fission yeast. In case of UBQLN1 and BAG6, introducing lysine leads to a reduced abundance due to proteasomal degradation of the proteins. For UBQLN1 we show that arginine residues within the lysine depleted region are critical for its ability to form cytosolic inclusions. We propose that selective pressure to avoid lysine residues may be a common evolutionary mechanism to prevent unwarranted ubiquitylation and/or perhaps other lysine post-translational modifications. This may be particularly relevant for UPS components as they closely and frequently encounter the ubiquitylation machinery and are thus more susceptible to non-specific ubiquitylation.",

The work described here aims at providing guidelines to achieve the best sequence coverage for the fragmentation of intact light and heavy chains generated from a simple reduction of intact antibodies using Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Three parameters were found crucial to this aim: the use of an electron-based activation technique, the multiplex selection of precursor ions of different charge states and the combination of replicates.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits a unique form of neural plasticity that results from continuous integration of adult born neurons, referred to as  adult neurogenesis. Recent studies have proposed that adult neurogenesis promotes the ability to encode new memories without interference from previously stored memories that share similar features, through a neural computation known as pattern separation. However, due to lack of in vivo physiological evidence, the manner in which adult neurogenesis contributes to pattern separation remains unknown. Here, we investigate the contribution of functionally integrated yet immature adult born granule cells (iGCs) to DG computations by examining how chronic ablation or acute chemogenetic silencing of iGCs affects the activity of mature granule cells (mGCs) using in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging. In both cases we observed altered remapping of mGCs but in opposite directions depending on their tuning selectivity. Rather than broadly modulating the activity of all mGCs, iGCs promote the remapping of place cells but limit the remapping of mGCs representing sensory cues (cue cells). We propose that these properties of iGCs explain their role in pattern separation because they promote the formation of non-overlapping representations for identical sensory cues encountered in different locations. Conversely, the absence of iGCs shifts the DG network to a state dominated by sensory cue information, a situation that is consistent with the overgeneralization often observed in anxiety disorders such as PTSD.",

However, several species exhibit steroid-independent sexual behaviour, and its molecular understanding is only beginning to be uncovered. The main goal of our experiment was to provide new insight into cell-specific roles that both neuronal and non-neuronal cells may play in steroid-independent male sexual behaviour. Forty B6D2F1 hybrid male mice underwent orchidectomy and were tested for reinstatement of steroid-independent male sexual behaviour after an extended period of social isolation caused by the COVID-19-mandated laboratory shutdown. After 62 weeks post-orchidectomy, 20.59% demonstrated reinstatement of steroid-independent male sexual behaviour (identified as  steroid-independent persistent maters), while 23.53% of the males did not display steroid-independent male sexual behaviour (identified as  steroid-independent non-maters). Using flow cytometry, we compared the preoptic area immunoexpression in NeuN+ neurons and Iba1+ microglia between steroid-independent persistent maters and steroid-independent non-maters (N = 5-6 per group). We found neuronal immunoexpression up-regulated for amyloid precursor protein and androgen receptor, as well as down-regulated for glucocorticoid receptor in steroid-independent persistent maters compared to steroid-independent non-maters. In conjunction, microglial immunoexpression of amyloid precursor protein was up-regulated in steroid-independent persistent maters compared to steroid-independent non-maters. These data suggest there are cell-specific immunoexpression differences, including the role of non-neuronal cells in steroid-independent male sexual behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) experiments have shown that animals are able to adapt their recorded neural activity in order to receive reward. Recent studies have highlighted two phenomena. First, the speed at which a BCI task can be learned is dependent on how closely the required neural activity aligns with pre-existing activity patterns: learning \"out-of-manifold\" tasks is slower than \"in-manifold\" tasks. Second, learning happens by \"re-association\": the overall distribution of neural activity patterns does not change significantly during task learning. These phenomena have been presented as distinctive aspects of BCI learning. Here we show, using simulations and theoretical analysis, that both phenomena result from the simple assumption that behaviour and representations are improved via gradient-based algorithms. We invoke Occams Razor to suggest that this straightforward explanation should be preferred when accounting for these experimental observations.",

    "abstract": "Previous infant entrainment research has shown neural entrainment to a wide range of stimuli and amplitude modulated frequencies. However, it is unknown if infants neurally entrain more strongly to some frequencies more than others, and to which low amplitude modulated frequency infants show the strongest entrainment. The current study seeks to address this by testing the neural entrainment of N=23 4-6-month-old infants and N=22 control group adult caregivers while they listened to a range of sinusoidally amplitude modulated beep stimuli at rest (no sound), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 Hz. Analysis examined differences across power and phase, regions of interest predetermined by previous literature and by segmented time windows. Results showed that the strongest entrainment was at 2Hz for both adult and infant participants; that there was no significant difference in power and phase, entrainment was occipital temporal and slightly left fronto-central in adults and right fronto-central and left occipito-temporal in infants, leading to some regions of interest used in previous studies being significant in infants and all regions of interest being significant in adults. Segmenting by time window did not show any significant increase or decrease in entrainment over time, but longer time windows showed a stronger entrainment response. In conclusion, it is important to choose appropriate stimulation frequencies when investigating entrainment between stimulation frequencies or across ages; whole head recording is recommended to see the full extent of activation; there is no preference on power vs phase analyses; and longer recordings show stronger effects.\n\nAuthor Contribution StatementIves, J., conceptualisation, data collection and curation, formal analysis, methodology, writing - original draft; Labendzki, P., data collection and curation, formal analysis, writing - review & editing; Perapoch Amado, M., data collection and curation, writing - review & editing; Greenwood, E., data collection and curation, participant recruitment, writing - review & editing; Viswanathan, N., data collection and curation, writing - review & editing; Northrop, T., data collection and curation, participant recruitment, writing - review & editing; Wass, S., conceptualisation, funding acquisition, methodology, project administration, supervision, writing - review & editing.\n\nHighlights2Hz amplitude modulation stimulation showed the strongest neural entrainment\n\nWe discuss power vs phase analyses of infant and adult frequency tagging responses\n\nWe illustrate topographic differences in adult and infant neural responses",

    "abstract": "Both deterministic and stochastic forces shape biofilm communities, but the balance between those forces is variable. Quantifying the balance is both desirable and challenging. For example, negative drift selection, a stochastic force, can be thought of as an organism experiencing  bad luck and manipulating  luck as a factor in real world systems is difficult. We used an agent-based model to manipulate luck by controlling seed values governing random number generation. We determined which organism among identical competitors experienced the greatest negative drift selection, gave it a deterministic growth advantage, and re-ran the simulation with the same seed. This enabled quantifying the growth advantage required to overcome drift, e.g., a 50% chance to thrive may require a 10-20% improved growth rate. Further, we found that crowding intensity affected that balance. At moderate spacings, there were wide ranges where neither drift nor growth dominated. Those ranges shrank at extreme spacings; close and loose crowding respectively favoured drift and growth. We explain how these results may partially illuminate two conundrums: the difference between taxa and functional stability in wastewater treatment plans and the difference between equivalent and total community size in neutral community assembly models.",

    "abstract": "Social bees harbor conserved gut microbiota that may have been acquired in a common ancestor of social bees and subsequently co-diversified with their hosts. However, most of this knowledge is based on studies on the gut microbiota of honey bees and bumble bees. Much less is known about the gut microbiota of the third and most diverse group of social bees, the stingless bees. Specifically, the absence of genomic data from their microbiota presents an important knowledge gap in understanding the evolution and functional diversity of the social bee microbiota. Here we combined community profiling with culturing and genome sequencing of gut bacteria from six neotropical stingless bee species from Brazil. Phylogenomic analyses show that most stingless bee gut isolates form deep-branching sister clades of core members of the honey bee and bumble bee gut microbiota with conserved functional capabilities, confirming the common ancestry and ecology of their microbiota. However, our bacterial phylogenies were not congruent with those of the host indicating that the evolution of the social bee gut microbiota was not driven by strict co-diversification, but included host switches and independent symbiont gain and losses. Finally, as reported for the honey bee and bumble bee microbiota, we find substantial genomic divergence among strains of stingless bee gut bacteria suggesting adaptation to different host species and glycan niches. Our study offers first insights into the genomic diversity of the stingless bee microbiota, and highlights the need for broader samplings to understand the evolution of the social bee gut microbiota.\n\nImportanceStingless bees are the most diverse group of the corbiculate bees and represent important pollinator species throughout the tropics and subtropics. They harbor specialized microbial communities in their gut that are related to those found in honey bees and bumble bees and that are likely important for bee health. Few bacteria have been cultured from the gut of stingless bees which has prevented characterization of their genomic diversity and functional potential. Here, we established cultures of major community members of the gut microbiota of six stingless bee species and sequenced their genomes. We find that most stingless bee isolates belong to novel bacterial species distantly related to those found in honey bees and bumble bees and encoding similar functional capabilities. Our study offers a new perspective on the evolution of the social bee gut microbiota and presents the basis to characterize the symbiotic relationships between gut bacteria and stingless bees.",

We analysed a collection (n=505) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from two high prevalence areas in South Africa (Cape Town and Johannesburg, 2019-2020), and found 53 independent acquisitions of 31 different mutations within the mmpR5 regulatory gene, with a particular enrichment of truncated MmpR5 in BDQ-R isolates by either frameshift or introduction of an insertion element. Truncations occurred across three M. tuberculosis lineages, impacting 66% of BDQ-R isolates. Extending our analysis to 1,961 isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) revealed that mmpR5-disrupted isolates had a median BDQ MIC of 0.25 mg/L, compared to the wild-type median of 0.06 mg/L. By matching mmpR5-disrupted isolates with phylogenetically close control isolates without the disruption, we were able to estimate the impact on MIC of individual mutations. In conclusion, as the MIC increase borders the ECOFF threshold for BDQ-R, we recommend the continued use of MICs and detection of MmpR5 truncations to identify modest shifts in BDQ-R.",

    "abstract": "High concentration of soluble E-cadherin (E-cad) was previously found in sera from Q fever patients. Here, BeWo cells which express a high concentration of E-cad were used as an in vitro model to investigate the expression and function of E-cad in response to infection by Coxiella burnetii, the etiological agent of Q fever. Infection of BeWo cells with C. burnetii leads to a decrease in the number of BeWo cells expressing E-cad at their membrane. A shedding of soluble E-cad was associated with the post-infection decrease of membrane-bound E-cad. The modulation of E-cad expression requires bacterial viability and was not found with heat-inactivated C. burnetii. Moreover, the intracytoplasmic cell concentration of {beta}-catenin ({beta}-cat), a ligand of E-cad, was reduced after bacterial infection, suggesting that the bacterium induces modulation of the E-cad/{beta}-cat signaling pathway and CDH1 and CTNNB1 genes transcription. Finally, several genes operating the canonical Wnt-Frizzled/{beta}-cat pathway were overexpressed in cells infected with C. burnetii. This was particularly evident with the highly virulent strain of C. burnetii, Guiana. Our data demonstrate that infection of BeWo cells by live C. burnetii modulates the E-cad/{beta}-cat signaling pathway.",

Recently, an array of technologies have been developed to query gene expression in a spatial context. These include techniques such as employing barcoded oligonucleotides, single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), and DNA nanoball (DNB)-patterned arrays. However, resolution and efficiency vary across platforms and technologies. To obtain spatially relevant biological information from spatially resolved transcriptomics, we combined the Stereo-seq workflow with CRISPRclean technology to develop the STOmics-GenX pipeline. STOmics-GenX not only allowed us to reduce genomic, mitochondrial, and ribosomal reads, but also lead to a [~]2.1-fold increase in the number of detected genes when compared to conventional Stereo-seq (STOmics). Additionally, the STOmics-GenX pipeline resulted in an improved detection of cell type specific genes, thereby improving cellular annotations. Most importantly, STOmics-GenX allowed for enhanced detection of clinically relevant biomarkers such as Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), enabling the identification of two spatially distinct subsets of hepatocytes in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. Thereby, combining CRISPRclean technology with STOmics not only allowed improved gene detection but also paved the way for spatial precision oncology by improved detection of clinically relevant biomarkers.",

We find that LUC7L2 and LUC7L enhance splicing of \"right-handed\" 5SS with stronger consensus matching on the intron side of the near-invariant /GU, while LUC7L3 preferentially enhances splicing of \"left-handed\" 5SS with stronger consensus matching on the exon side of the splice junction. Specificity for right- or left-handed 5SS is conferred by the distinct structured N-terminal domains of LUC7L2 and LUC7L3. Evolutionary analysis shows that divergence of LUC7L3 and LUC7L2 subfamilies occurred prior to the divergence of plants from animals/fungi, and suggests that loss of the LUC7L3 subfamily from the fungal lineage contributed to the predominance of right-handed 5SS in fungi.",

As Leishmania lack a functional non-homologous DNA end joining pathway however, obtaining null mutants typically requires additional donor DNA, selection of drug resistance-associated edits or time-consuming isolation of clones. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens across different conditions and across multiple Leishmania species are therefore unfeasible at present. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 cytosine base editor (CBE) toolbox that overcomes these limitations. We employed CBEs in Leishmania to introduce STOP codons by converting cytosine into thymine and created www.leishbaseedit.net for CBE primer design in kinetoplastids. Through reporter assays and by targeting single- and multi-copy genes in L. mexicana, L. major, L. donovani and L. infantum, we demonstrate how this tool can efficiently generate functional null mutants by expressing just one single-guide RNA, reaching up to 100% editing rate in non-clonal populations. We then generated a Leishmania-optimised CBE and successfully targeted an essential gene in a plasmid library delivered loss-of-function screen in L. mexicana. Since our method does not require DNA double-strand breaks, homologous recombination, donor DNA or isolation of clones, we believe that this enables for the first time functional genetic screens in Leishmania via delivery of plasmid libraries.",

    "abstract": "Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are essential ATP-independent chaperones that protect the cellular proteome during stress. These proteins assemble into polydisperse oligomeric structures, the composition of which dramatically affects their chaperone activity. The biomolecular consequences of variations in sHSP ratios, especially inside living cells, remain elusive. Here, we study the consequences of altering the relative expression levels of HspB2 and HspB3. These chaperones are partners in a hetero-oligomeric complex, and genetic mutations that abolish their mutual interaction are associated with myopathic disorders.\n\nHspB2 displays three distinct phenotypes when co-expressed with HspB3 at varying ratios. Expression of HspB2 alone lead to formation of liquid nuclear condensates, while shifting the stoichiometry towards HspB3 resulted in the formation of large solid-like aggregates. Only cells co-expressing HspB2 with a limited amount of HspB3 showed a homogeneous nuclear distribution of HspB2. Strikingly, both condensates and aggregates were reversible, as shifting the HspB2:HspB3 balance in situ resulted in dissolution of these structures.\n\nTo uncover the molecular composition of HspB2 condensates and aggregates, we used APEX-mediated proximity labelling. Most proteins interact transiently with the condensates and were neither enriched nor depleted. In contrast, we found that HspB2:HspB3 aggregates sequestered several disordered proteins among which autophagy factors, suggesting that the cell is actively attempting to clear these aggregates. This study presents a striking example of how changes in the relative expression levels of interacting proteins affects their phase behavior. Our approach can be a useful tool to study the role of protein stoichiometry in other biomolecular condensates.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519563v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf5787org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7a18org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17cd64corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d9392a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- Small heat shock protein hetero-oligomerization affects their chaperone function\n- The HspB2:HspB3 expression ratio determines phase separation and aggregation\n- HspB2 condensates and HspB2:HspB3 aggregates are fully reversible\n- Proximity labelling unveils autophagy factor recruitment to HspB2:HspB3 aggregates\n- Stoichiometry-dependant regulation of phase behaviour may be widespread in biology",

Retinalophototrophy, one of two independently evolved phototrophic pathways, consists of a simple system of microbial rhodopsins which have spread broadly through the tree of life via horizontal gene transfer. Here, we sought to determine whether Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a heterotrophic fungus with no known evolutionary history of phototrophy, can function as a facultative artificial phototroph after acquiring a single rhodopsin gene. We transformed S. cerevisiae into a facultative phototroph by inserting a rhodopsin protein from Ustilago maydis into the yeast vacuole, allowing light to pump protons into the vacuolar compartment, a function typically driven by consuming ATP. We show that yeast with rhodopsins gain a selective advantage when grown under green light, growing more rapidly than their non-phototrophic ancestor or rhodopsin-bearing yeast cultured in the dark. These results underscore the remarkable ease with which rhodopsins may be horizontally transferred even in eukaryotes, providing novel biological function without first requiring evolutionary optimization.",

The edited calf has no off-target edits and appears normal and healthy at 16 months of age without obvious adverse effects from the on-target edit. This precision bred, proof-of-concept animal provides the first evidence that intentional genome alterations in CD46 may reduce the burden of BVDV-associated diseases in cattle, and is consistent with our stepwise, in vitro and ex vivo experiments with cell lines and matched fetal clones.",

Here we introduce novel and broadly applicable immunization (Cross-link PPIs and immunize llamas, ChILL) and selection strategies (Display and co-selection, DisCO) for the discovery of diverse Nanobodies that either stabilize or disrupt PPIs in a single experiment. We applied ChILL and DisCO to identify competitive, connective or fully allosteric Nanobodies that inhibit or facilitate the formation of the SOS1*RAS complex and modulate the nucleotide exchange rate on this pivotal GTPase in vitro and RAS signalling in cellulo. One of these connective Nanobodies fills a cavity that was previously identified as the binding pocket for a series of therapeutic lead compounds. The long complementarity-determining region (CDR3) that penetrates this binding pocket serves as an innovative pharmacophore for extending the repertoire of potential leads.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Family Symbiodiniaceae) are the primary producer of energy for many cnidarians, including corals. The intricate coral-dinoflagellate symbiotic relationship is becoming increasingly important under climate change, as its breakdown leads to mass coral bleaching and often mortality. Despite methodological progress, assessing the phenotypic traits of Symbiodiniaceae in-hospite remains a complex task. Bio-optics, biochemistry, or \"-omics\" techniques are expensive, often inaccessible to investigators, or lack the resolution required to understand single-cell phenotypic states within endosymbiotic dinoflagellate assemblages. To help address this issue, we developed a protocol that collects information on cell autofluorescence, shape, and size to simultaneously generate phenotypic profiles for thousands of Symbiodiniaceae cells, thus revealing phenotypic variance of the Symbiodiniaceae assemblage to the resolution of single cells. As flow cytometry is adopted as a robust and efficient method for cell counting, integration of our protocol into existing workflows allows researchers to acquire a new level of resolution for studies examining the acclimation and adaptation strategies of Symbiodiniaceae assemblages.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) are frequently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including increased risk for restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRBs). Consistent with observations in humans, FXS model mice display distinct RRBs and hyperactivity that are consistent with dysfunctional cortico-striatal circuits, an area relatively unexplored in FXS. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we dissected the contribution of two populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (SPNs) in the expression of RRBs in FXS model mice. We found that dysregulated protein synthesis at cortico-striatal synapses is a molecular culprit of the synaptic and ASD-associated motor phenotypes displayed by FXS model mice. Cell-type-specific translational profiling of the FXS mouse striatum revealed differentially translated mRNAs, providing critical information concerning potential therapeutic targets. Our findings represent the first evidence of a cell-type specific impact of the loss of FMRP on translation and the sequence of neuronal events in the striatum that drive RRBs in FXS.\n\nHighlightsDysregulated striatal protein synthesis underlies altered synaptic plasticity and RRBs displayed by FXS model mice\n\nFXS model mice exhibit cell type-specific molecular, morphological, and synaptic changes in the dorsolateral striatum\n\nSelective deletion of Fmr1 from dSNPs in mice alters translation and causes repetitive behavior\n\nTRAP-Seq indicates that there is altered binding of >120 mRNAs to ribosomes in dSNPs of Fmr1 KO mice\n\nG-protein signaling (RGS) 4 translation is significantly reduced in dSPNs in FXS model mice\n\nTreatment of FXS model mice with VU0152100, a positive allosteric modulator of the M4 muscarinic receptor that is upstream of RGS4, can reverse RRBs",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii secretes protein effectors to subvert the human immune system sufficiently to establish a chronic infection. Relative to murine infections, little is known about which parasite effectors disarm human immune responses. Here we used targeted CRISPR screening to identify secreted protein effectors required for parasite survival in IFN{gamma}-activated human cells. Independent screens were carried out using two Toxoplasma strains which differ in virulence in mice, leading to the identification of effectors required for survival in IFN{gamma}-activated human cells. We identify the secreted protein GRA57 and two other proteins, GRA70 and GRA71, that together form a complex which enhances the ability of parasites to persist in IFN{gamma}-activated human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). Components of the protein machinery required for export of Toxoplasma proteins into the host cell were also found to be important for parasite resistance to IFN{gamma} in human cells, but these export components function independently of the identified protein complex. Host-mediated ubiquitination of the parasite vacuole has previously been associated with increased parasite clearance from human cells, but we find that vacuoles from GRA57, GRA70 and GRA71 knockout strains are surprisingly less ubiquitinated by the host cell. We hypothesise that deletion of this trimeric complex renders parasites hypersensitive to remaining ubiquitination, resulting in increased parasite clearance.",

    "abstract": "Drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) are designed to remove physical, chemical, and biological contaminants. However, until recently, the role of DWTPs in minimizing the cycling of antibiotic resistance determinants has got limited attention. In particular, the risk of selecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) is largely overlooked in chlorine-free DWTPs where biological processes are applied. Here, we combined high-throughput quantitative PCR and metagenomics to analyze the abundance and dynamics of microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) across the treatment trains of two chlorine-free DWTPs involving dune-based and reservoir-based systems. The microbial diversity of the water being treated increased after all biological unit operations, namely rapid and slow sand filtration (SSF), and granular activated carbon filtration. Both DWTPs reduced the concentration of ARGs and MGEs in the water by about 2.5 log gene copies mL-1, despite their relative increase in the disinfection sub-units (SSF in dune-based and UV treatment in reservoir-based DWTPs). The total microbial concentration was also reduced (2.5 log units), and none of the DWTPs were enriched for antibiotic resistant bacteria. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of chlorine-free DWTPs in supplying safe drinking water while reducing the concentration of antibiotic resistance determinants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that monitors the presence and dynamics of antibiotic resistance determinants in chlorine-free DWTPs.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 provirus mainly consists of internal coding region flanked by the 2 same long terminal repeats (LTRs) at each terminus. The LTRs play important roles in HIV-1 reverse transcription, integration, and transcription by the association with host factors. However, despite of the significant study advances of the internal coding regions of HIV-1 by using definite reference classification, there are no systematic classifications for HIV-1 5 LTRs, which hinders our elaboration on 5 LTR and a better understanding of the viral origin, spread and therapy. Here, by analyzing all available resources of 5 LTR sequences in public databases following 4 recognized principles for the reference classification, 83 representatives and 14 consensus sequences were identified as representatives of 2 groups, 6 subtypes, 6 sub-subtypes, and 9 CRFs. To test the reliability of our established classification system, the constructed references were applied to identify the 5 LTR assignment of the 22 clinical isolates in China. The results revealed that 16 out of 22 tested strains showed a consistent subtype classification with the previous LTR-independent classification system. However, 6 strains, for which recombination events within 5 LTR were demonstrated, unexpectedly showed a different subtype classification, leading a significant change of binding sites for important transcription factors including SP1, p53, and NF-{kappa}B. The binding change of these transcriptional factors would probably affect the transcriptional activity of 5 LTR. This study established a unified classification system for HIV-1 5 LTRs, which will facilitate HIV-1 characterization and be helpful for both basic and clinical research fields.\n\nIMPORTANCEHere, a scientific, reliable, and usable classification system based on the 5 LTR sequences was established, which will allow us to effectively facilitate the precise typing of HIV-1 strains. This classification system was applied to 22 HIV-1 strains circulating in China, we found that 6 out of 22 strains analyzed, belonged to a different subtype when our results were compared to those obtained with the previous LTR-independent classification system. Thus, these data demonstrated that our classification method could greatly improve the HIV-1 subtype classification. We found that 6 5 LTR sequences showed recombination events, leading to a significant exchange of the binding sites of transcriptional factors. Thus, this work established a comprehensive HIV-1 5 LTR classification system, which will help the scientific community to precisely characterize HIV-1 variants, and better understand the origin and spread of HIV-1 strains, and it also may be helpful for pathogenicity and transmissibility evaluation studies.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides has evolved in Bactrocera oleae populations in Greece, threatening the efficacy of control interventions based on this insecticide class. Here we report the collection of populations from Crete with resistance levels reaching up to 331-folds, compared to susceptible laboratory strains and show that pyrethroid resistance is substantially suppressed by the PBO synergist, suggesting the involvement of detoxification enzymes. To identify specific candidate genes implicated in resistance, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis, between the pyrethroid resistant populations from Crete and the susceptible laboratory strains, using both whole bodies and Malpighian tubules. Several genes were found differentially transcribed between resistant and susceptible flies in each comparison, with P450s being among the most highly over-expressed detoxification genes in pyrethroid resistant populations. Four of the over-expressed P450s (Cyp6A61, Cyp6G6, Cyp4P6 and Cyp6G28) were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and in vitro metabolism assays revealed that CYP6A61 is capable of metabolizing alpha-cypermethrin, while CYP6G6, CYP4P6 and CYP6G28 are capable of metabolizing deltamethrin. No metabolism of neonicotinoid insecticides was recorded. We further silenced CYP6G6 in vivo, via RNAi, which led to a small, but significant increase in deltamethrin toxicity. The study provides valuable information towards the development of molecular diagnostics and evidence-based insecticide resistance management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are important contributors to the internal organization of the cell material. While initially described as liquid-like droplets, the term biomolecular condensates is now used to describe a diversity of condensed phase assemblies with material properties extending from low to high viscous liquids, gels, and even glasses. Because the material properties of condensates are determined by the intrinsic behaviour of their molecules, characterising such properties is integral to rationalising the molecular mechanisms that dictate their functions and roles in health and disease. Here, we apply and compare three distinct computational methods to measure the viscoelasticity of biomolecular condensates in molecular simulations. These methods are the shear stress relaxation modulus integration (SSRMI), the oscillatory shear (OS) technique, and the bead tracking (BT) method. We find that, although all of these methods provide consistent results for the viscosity of the condensates, the SSRMI and OS techniques outperform the BT method in terms of computational efficiency and statistical uncertainty. We, thus, apply the SSRMI and OS techniques for a set of 12 different protein/RNA systems using a sequence-dependent high-resolution coarse-grained model. Our results reveal a strong correlation between condensate viscosity and density, as well as with protein/RNA length and the number of stickers vs. spacers in the amino-acid protein sequence. Moreover, we couple the SSRMI and the OS technique to nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that mimic the progressive liquid-to-gel transition of protein condensates due to the accumulation of inter-protein {beta}-sheets. We compare the behaviour of three different protein condensates--i.e., those formed by either hnRNPA1, FUS, or TDP-43 proteins--whose liquid-to-gel transitions are associated with the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We find that both SSRMI and OS techniques successfully predict the transition from functional liquid-like behaviour to kinetically arrested states once the network of inter-protein {beta}-sheets has percolated through the condensates. Overall, our work provides a comparison of different modelling rheological techniques to assess the viscosity of biomolecular condensates, a critical magnitude that provides information on the behaviour of biomolecules inside condensates.",
