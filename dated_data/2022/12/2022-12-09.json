    "abstract": "Neural coding and memory formation depend on temporal spiking sequences that span high-dimensional neural ensembles. The unsupervised discovery and characterization of these spiking sequences requires a suitable dissimilarity measure to spiking patterns, which can then be used for clustering and decoding. Here, we present a new dissimilarity measure based on optimal transport theory called SpikeShip, which compares multineuron spiking patterns based on all the relative spike-timing relationships among neurons. SpikeShip computes the optimal transport cost to make all the relative spike-timing relationships (across neurons) identical between two spiking patterns. We show that this transport cost can be decomposed into a temporal rigid translation term, which captures global latency shifts, and a vector of neuron-specific transport flows, which reflect inter-neuronal spike timing differences. SpikeShip can be effectively computed for high-dimensional neuronal ensembles, has a low (linear) computational cost that has the same order as the spike count, and is sensitive to higher-order correlations. Furthermore SpikeShip is binless, can handle any form of spike time distributions, is not affected by firing rate fluctuations, can detect patterns with a low signal-to-noise ratio, and can be effectively combined with a sliding window approach. We compare the advantages and differences between SpikeShip and other measures like SPIKE and Victor-Purpura distance. We applied SpikeShip to large-scale Neuropixel recordings during spontaneous activity and visual encoding. We show that high-dimensional spiking sequences detected via SpikeShip reliably distinguish between different natural images and different behavioral states. These spiking sequences carried complementary information to conventional firing rate codes. SpikeShip opens new avenues for studying neural coding and memory consolidation by rapid and unsupervised detection of temporal spiking patterns in high-dimensional neural ensembles.",

    "abstract": "The human brain scaffolds social cognitive functions, including Theory of Mind, empathy and compassion, through its functional and microstructural organization. However, it remains unclear how the learning and refinement of these skills may, in turn, shape brain function and structure. Here we studied if different types of social mental training can lead to plastic changes in brain function and microstructure. We studied a group of 332 healthy adults (197 women, 20-55 years) with repeated multimodal neuroimaging and behavioral testing. Our neuroimaging approach capitalized on the quantification of cortical functional gradients and myelin-sensitive T1 relaxometry, two emerging measures of cortical functional organization and microstructure. Longitudinal analysis indicated marked changes in intrinsic cortical function and microstructure, which varied as a function of social training content. In particular, we observed consistent differential change in function and microstructure between attention-mindfulness and socio-cognitive training in regions functionally associated with attention and interoception, including insular and parietal cortices. Conversely, socio-affective and socio-cognitive training resulted in differential microstructural changes in regions classically implicated in interoceptive and emotional processing, including insular and orbitofrontal areas, but did not result in functional reorganization. Notably, longitudinal changes in cortical function and microstructure were predictive of behavioral change in attention, compassion and perspective-taking, suggesting behavioral relevance. In sum, our work provides evidence for functional and microstructural plasticity after the training of social-interoceptive functions, and provides a causal perspective on the neural basis of behavioral adaptation in human adults.",

    "abstract": "The transition between pluripotent and tissue-specific states is a key aspect of development. Understanding the pathways driving these transitions will facilitate the engineering of properly differentiated cells for experimental and therapeutic uses. Here, we showed that during mesoderm differentiation, the transcription factor Oct1 activated developmental lineage-appropriate genes that were silent in pluripotent cells. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with an inducible knockout of Oct1, we showed that Oct1 deficiency resulted in poor induction of mesoderm-specific genes, leading to impaired mesodermal and terminal muscle differentiation. Oct1-deficient cells exhibited poor temporal coordination of the induction of lineage-specific genes and showed inappropriate developmental lineage branching, resulting in poorly differentiated cell states retaining epithelial characteristics. In ESCs, Oct1 localized with the pluripotency factor Oct4 at mesoderm-associated genes and remained bound to those loci during differentiation after the dissociation of Oct4. Binding events for Oct1 overlapped with those for the histone lysine demethylase Utx, and an interaction between Oct1 and Utx suggested that these two proteins cooperate to activate gene expression. The specificity of the ubiquitous Oct1 for the induction of mesodermal genes could be partially explained by the frequent coexistence of Smad and Oct binding sites at mesoderm-specific genes and the cooperative stimulation of mesodermal gene transcription by Oct1 and Smad3. Together, these results identify Oct1 as a key mediator of mesoderm lineage-specific gene induction.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms behind neural control of movement have been an active area of research. Goal-directed movement is a common experimental paradigm used to understand these mechanisms and relevant neural pathways. In this paper, we attempt to build an anatomically and physiologically realistic model of spinal cord along with the relevant circuitry and interface it with a musculoskeletal model of an upper limb, using the NEUROiD platform. The neuronal model (simulated on NEURON) and the musculoskeletal model (simulated on OpenSim) are cosimulated on NEUROiD. We then use Deep Reinforcement Learning to obtain a functionally equivalent model of the supraspinal components and the descending cortical activations feeding into the last-order interneurons and motoneurons. Uniplanar goal directed movement of the elbow joint was used as the goal for the learning algorithm. Key aspects of our work are: (1) Our solution converges naturally to the triphasic response observed in goal directed tasks (2) Gradually increasing the complexity of task helped in faster learning (3) In response to corticospinal inputs, our model could produce movements on which it was not explicitly trained, but were close to the trained movements. Being able to generate movements on which the model was not explicitly trained, implies that the movement repertoire that a biomimetic model needs to learn, could be much smaller than the complete set of movements it can execute. We hope that this will lead to building larger and complex biomimetic systems, one block at a time.",

    "abstract": "Drought associated with climate change can stress plants, altering their interactions with phytophagous arthropods. Drought not only impacts cultivated plants but also their parasites, which in some cases are favored by drought. Herbivorous arthropods feeding on drought-stressed plants typically produce bigger offspring and develop faster. However, it is unclear how much responses to drought stress differ among populations of herbivore species. Here, we evaluate variability among populations of a major agricultural pest, the two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in response to drought stress. We compare key life history parameters of twelve populations that originate from climates ranging from wet and cool Atlantic locations to medium to dry hot Mediterranean locations. We evaluated how plant drought stress affects four life history traits: development time, fecundity, sex-ratio and emigration rate in an experiment comparing well-watered and drought-stressed bean plants. Mites feeding on drought-stressed plants developed faster and attempted to leave leaves less often, and young females were more fecund. The mites from wet temperate climates exhibited greater plasticity between the two water regimes than mites originating from dryer and hot climates, suggesting that the climate in the area of origin influences mite response to drought.",

    "abstract": "A key problem in systems biology is the discovery of regulatory mechanisms that drive phenotypic behaviour of complex biological systems in the form of multi-level networks. Modern multi-omics profiling techniques probe these fundamental regulatory networks but are often hampered by experimental restrictions leading to missing data or partially measured omics types for subsets of individuals due to cost restrictions. In such scenarios, in which missing data is present, classical computational approaches to infer regulatory networks are limited. In recent years, approaches have been proposed to infer sparse regression models in the presence of missing information. Nevertheless, these methods have not been adopted for regulatory network inference yet.\n\nIn this study, we integrated regression-based methods that can handle missingness into KiMONo, a Knowledge guIded Multi-Omics Network inference approach, and benchmarked their performance on commonly encountered missing data scenarios in single- and multi-omics studies. Overall, two-step approaches that explicitly handle missingness performed best for a wide range of random- and block-missingness scenarios on imbalanced omics-layers dimensions, while methods implicitly handling missingness performed best on balanced omics-layers dimensions. Our results show that robust multi-omics network inference in the presence of missing data with KiMONo is feasible and thus allows users to leverage available multi-omics data to its full extent.\n\nJuan Henao is a 3rd year PhD candidate at Computational Health Center at Helmholtz Center Munich working on multi-omics and clinical data integration using both, bulk and single-cell data.\n\nMichael Lauber is a PhD Candidate at the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at the Technical University Munich.

    "abstract": "Herbivory can have contrasted impacts on soil microbes and nutrient cycling, which has stimulated the development of conceptual frameworks exploring the links between below- and aboveground processes. The \"productivity model\" predicts that herbivores stimulate microbial activities and accelerate nutrient mineralization in productive ecosystems, while they have an opposite effect in less productive ecosystems. In parallel, the \"diet model\" predicts that herbivores feeding on conservative plants accelerate nutrient cycling while those feeding on exploitative plants decelerate nutrient cycling, due to changes in litter inputs. Since these two frameworks can lead to conflicting predictions in some cases, experimental evidence combining herbivore diet and plant productivity is required.\n\nDuring two consecutive years, we conducted an experiment controlling the presence of three grasshopper species consuming either grasses, forbs or both in twelve natural and managed alpine grasslands with contrasted productivities. In order to assess the effects of herbivory on soil microbes, we measured their extracellular enzymatic activities, biomass and potential nitrogen mineralization (PNM). Soil and vegetation were also characterized to test how much they modulated the effects of herbivory on microbes.\n\nContrary to the predictions of the diet model, the effects of herbivory on microbial characteristics did not depend on the herbivores diet, but were influenced by primary production, though in a way that differed from the productivity model. The most productive sites were constituted by exploitative plant species which depleted N resources in the soil, and by microbes producing relatively few extracellular enzymes, leading to a lower PNM. Herbivory increased microbial biomass and decreased the production of extracellular enzymes in those sites, possibly through the stimulation of root exudates produced by exploitative species. The least productive sites were characterized by conservative plants, high soil C content, and by microbes having a resource acquisition strategy (more extracellular enzymes, higher PNM). Herbivory decreased microbial biomass and increased the production of extracellular enzymes in those sites. This pattern can be explained by the loss of carbon associated with insect respiration, which increases the resource requirements of microbes and by a lower production of root exudates by conservative species. Therefore, the effects of two years of herbivory on soil microbes were at odds with the productivity model, which focuses instead on longer term effects corresponding to herbivory-induced changes in plant species composition. This highlights the multidimensional feature of the impacts of herbivory on ecosystem functioning, both in space and time.",

We estimate the function values through simulations employing reconstructions of the rat somatosensory cortex from the Blue Brain Project. The response of different cell types is simulated using the NEURON simulation environment. We represent and analyze the angular response as an expansion in spherical harmonics.\n\nMain resultsWe report membrane perturbation values comparable to those in the literature, extend them to different cell types, and provide their profiles as spherical harmonic coefficients. We show that at rest, responses are dominated by their dipole terms ({ell} = 1), in agreement with experimental findings and compartment theory. Indeed, we show analytically that for a passive cell, only the dipole term is nonzero. However, while minor, other terms are relevant for states different from resting. In particular, we show how{ell} = 0 and{ell} = 2 terms can modify the function to induce asymmetries in the response.\n\nSignificanceThis work provides a practical framework for the representation of the effects of weak electric fields on different neuron types and their main regions--an important milestone for developing micro- and mesoscale models and optimizing brain stimulation solutions.",

    "abstract": "The ability to visualize small moving objects is vital for the survival of many animals, as these could represent predators or prey. For example, predatory insects, including dragonflies, robber flies and killer flies, perform elegant, high-speed pursuits of both biological and artificial targets. Many non-predatory insects, including male hoverflies and blowflies, also pursue targets during territorial or courtship interactions. To date, most hoverfly pursuits were studied outdoors. To investigate naturalistic hoverfly (Eristalis tenax) pursuits under more controlled settings, we constructed an indoor arena that was large enough to encourage naturalistic behavior. We presented artificial beads of different sizes, moving at different speeds, and filmed pursuits with two cameras, allowing subsequent 3D reconstruction of the hoverfly and bead position as a function of time. We show that male E. tenax hoverflies are unlikely to use strict heuristic rules based on angular size or speed to determine when to start pursuit, at least in our indoor setting. We found that hoverflies pursued faster beads when the trajectory involved flying downwards towards the bead. Furthermore, we show that target pursuit behavior can be broken down into two stages. In the first stage the hoverfly attempts to rapidly decreases the distance to the target by intercepting it at high speed. During the second stage the hoverflys forward speed is correlated with the speed of the bead, so that the hoverfly remains close, but without catching it. This may be similar to dragonfly shadowing behavior, previously coined  motion camouflage.",

The electrodes targeted the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), which is a part of the reward system in the deep brain. Following the recovery period, the rats were placed in a plain field where they could move freely, but wired to a stimulation circuit. An image sensor installed over the field detected the subjects position, which triggered the stimulator such that the rat remained within the virtual cage. We conducted a behavioral experiment to evaluate the sojourn ratio of rats residing in the region. Thereafter, a histological analysis of the rat brain was performed to confirm the position of the stimulation sites in the brain.\n\nSeven rats survived the surgery and the recovery period without technical failures such as connector breaks. We observed that three of them tended to stay in the virtual cage during stimulation, and this effect was maintained for two weeks. Histological analysis revealed that the electrode tips were correctly placed in the MFB region of the rats. The other four subjects showed no apparent preference for the virtual cage. In these rats, we did not find electrode tips in the MFB, or could not determine their positions.\n\nAlmost half of the rats tended to remain inside the virtual cage when position-related reward stimuli were triggered in the MFB region. Notably, our system did not require previous training or sequential interventions to affect the behavioral preferences of subjects.

We hypothesise that a similar metabolic remodelling also occurs during physiological skeletal muscle hypertrophy.\n\nMethodsWe used mass spectrometry in hypertrophying muscles both in C2C12 muscle cells in vitro and plantaris mice muscle in vivo and assessed metabolomic changes and the incorporation of stable isotope [U-13C6]glucose tracer compared with non-treated controls. We also performed enzyme inhibition for further mechanistic analysis and a systematic review to align any changes in metabolomics during muscle growth with previous findings.\n\nResultsBoth our metabolomics analysis and the systematic review reveal altered metabolite concentrations in anabolic pathways such as in the pentose phosphate and serine synthesis pathway to build up biomass, as well as in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway that serves as a basis for the post-translational so-called O-linked glycosylation modification. We further demonstrated that labelled carbon from [U-13C6]glucose is increasingly incorporated into the non-essential amino acids in hypertrophying myotubes. The inhibition of the key enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) supresses muscle protein synthesis by 75% highlighting the importance of the serine pathway for maintaining muscle size.\n\nConclusionUnderstanding the mechanisms that regulates skeletal muscle mass will help in developing effective treatments against muscle weakness. Our results provide evidence for metabolic rewiring of glycolytic intermediates into anabolic pathways during muscle growth, such as in the serine synthesis and hexosamine biosynthetic pathways.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe activity of the developing cortex is characteristically discontinuous where sudden high amplitude bursts interrupt periods of quiescent background. While the functional importance of this activity is clear, its aetiology is not known. Here, we hypothesise that this alternating pattern arises because of \"refractoriness\" of cortical networks following spontaneous activation.\n\nMethodsTo test this hypothesis, we assessed whether spontaneous activity in sensory networks depressed their excitability by measuring the impact of ongoing activity on the response to an external sensory stimulus. We recorded cortical activity before and after mechanical tactile stimulation of hands and feet in 35 preterm infants of median 32 weeks post-menstrual age.\n\nResultsMechanical stimulation evoked wideband energy increases with two distinct peaks within the delta and alpha-beta band. The delta activity engaged extended cortical areas, while the faster activity engaged local somatotopically specific areas. By then characterising the spectro-spatial properties of the spontaneous activity preceding stimulation, we showed that baseline energy with a distribution and spectral profile similar to that of somatosensory-evoked activity dampened the energy changes elicited by touching the body.\n\nDiscussionSensory-evoked activity in preterm human neonates likely represents the coordinated activation of extended (tangential) and local (e.g. columnar) cortical aggregates. The occurrence of spontaneous cortical events in the same cortical regions depresses their excitability preventing their immediate re-engagement. This \"refractoriness\" offers the first etiological explanation to the cyclical burst-quiescence pattern typical of preterm cortical activity.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex generates flexible behavior by learning. Reinforcement learning is thought to be driven by error signals in midbrain dopamine neurons. However, they project more densely to basal ganglia than cortex, leaving open the possibility of another source of learning signals for cortex. The locus coeruleus (LC) contains most of the brains norepinephrine (NE) neurons and project broadly to cortex. We measured activity from identified mouse LC-NE neurons during a behavioral task requiring ongoing learning from reward prediction errors (RPEs). We found two types of LC-NE neurons: neurons with wide action potentials (type I) were excited by positive RPE and showed an increasing relationship with change of choice likelihood. Neurons with thin action potentials (type II) were excited by lack of reward and showed a decreasing relationship with change of choice likelihood. Silencing LC-NE neurons changed future choices, as predicted from the electrophysiological recordings and a model of how RPEs are used to guide learning. We reveal functional heterogeneity of a neuromodulatory system in the brain and show that NE inputs to cortex act as a quantitative learning signal for flexible behavior.",

How these capillary types emerge in a brain region-specific manner and subsequently establish intrabrain vascular heterogeneity remains unclear. Here, we show a core angiogenic mechanism critical for fenestrated brain capillary development via a comparative analysis of the zebrafish choroid plexuses (CPs) and circumventricular organs (CVOs), demonstrating capillary-type-selective vascularization mechanisms. We found that zebrafish deficient for Gpr124, Reck, or Wnt7aa exhibit severely-impaired BBB angiogenesis without any apparent defect in fenestrated capillary formation in the CPs and CVOs. Conversely, simultaneous genetic loss of various Vegf combinations revealed remarkable heterogeneity of endothelial requirements for Vegfs-dependent angiogenesis within and across these organs, identifying unexpected interplay of Vegfc/d and Vegfa in fenestrated brain capillary formation. Expression analysis and paracrine activity-deficient vegfc mutant characterization suggest that endothelial cells and non-neuronal specialized cell types present in the CPs and CVOs are major sources of Vegfs responsible for regionally-restricted angiogenic interplay. Thus, local presentations and interplay of Vegfc/d and Vegfa control brain region-specific emergence of fenestrated capillaries, providing insight into fenestrated capillary formation in other organs and also how intra-organ vascular heterogeneity arises.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary processes leave footprints across the genome over time. Highly homozygous regions may correspond to positive selection of favourable alleles, while maintenance of heterozygous regions may be due to balancing selection phenomena. We analyzed 176 genomes coming from 20 sequenced US fish and 156 fish from three different French lines that were genotyped using a HD Axiom Trout Genotyping 665K SNP Array. Using methods based on either Run of Homozygosity or Extended Haplotype Homozygosity, we detected selection signals in four domesticated rainbow trout populations. Nine genomic regions composed of 253 genes, mainly located on chromosome 2 but also on chromosomes 12, 15, 16, and 20, were identified under positive selection in all four populations. In addition, four heterozygous regions containing 29 genes putatively under balancing selection were also shared by the four populations and located on chromosomes 10, 13, and 19. Whatever the homozygous or heterozygous nature of the region, we always found some genes highly conserved among vertebrates due to their critical roles in cellular and nuclear organisation, embryonic development or immunity. We identify new promising candidate genes involved in rainbow trout fitness, as well as genes already detected under positive selection in other fishes (auts2, atp1b3, zp4, znf135, igf-1, brd2, col9a2, mrap2, pbx1, emilin-3). These findings represent a genome-wide map of signatures of selection common over rainbow trout populations, which is the foundation to understand the processes in action and to identify what kind of diversity should be preserved, or conversely avoided in breeding programs, in order to maintain or improve essential biological functions in domesticated rainbow trout populations.",

NK cell effector functions are regulated by microenvironmental factors, including cytokines, metabolites and nutrients. Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient that plays an indispensable role in embryogenesis and development, but was also reported to regulate immune responses. However, the role of vitamin A in regulating NK cell functions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the most prevalent vitamin A metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), induces transcriptional and functional changes in NK cells leading to altered metabolism and reduced IFN-{gamma} production in response to a wide range of stimuli. atRA-exposed NK cells display a reduced ability to support dendritic cell (DC) maturation and to eliminate immature DCs. Moreover, they support the polarization and proliferation of regulatory T cells. These results imply that in vitamin A-enriched environments, NK cells can acquire regulatory-like functions and might promote tolerogenic immunity and/or immunosuppression.",

    "abstract": "Sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation are very active in coastal sediments. They shape the biogeochemistry and microbial ecology at hot places of organic matter metabolism. Different from the well-studied sulfate reduction, sulfur oxidation in coastal sediments is still full of questions. Herein, we investigated the distribution of reduced sulfur compounds in differently layers of coastal sediments at the Yellow sea and found that sulfide (H2S), sulfane sulfur (S0), and thiosulfate mainly accumulated in anaerobic sediments and were mostly oxidized in anoxic and oxic interface in the sediments and the sea water. Bacterial community analysis indicated that heterotrophic bacteria are dominating species in surface sediments and sea water. Metagenome analysis showed that two sulfur-oxidizing genes encoding sulfide:quinone oxidoreductases (SQR) and persufide dioxygenases (PDO), were sharply more abundant than other sulfur-oxidizing genes in the coastal sediments. Since members of the marine Roseobacter clade were dominant in coastal waters and sediments, we studied the sulfur oxidation pathway in the Roseobacter Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 and found that sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase, and sulfite-oxidizing enzyme were the main enzymes for the oxidation of H2S, zerovalent sulfur, and sulfite/thiosulfate. This study, for the first time, clarified the dominating function of heterotrophic bacteria in sulfur oxidation in the coastal sediments and sea water.\n\nIMPORTANCECoastal sediments are the most productive ecosystems. We performed the microbial community diversity and metagenomic analysis of seawater and coastal sediments of the Yellow Sea and explored the sulfur oxidation process in them. We found that heterotrophic bacteria are dominating species in surface sediments and sea water, sulfide and sulfane sulfur were mostly oxidized in surface sediments, and the genes encoding SQR, PDO, and SOE are abundant. Using Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 as the model strain, we studied how these enzymes cooperate to oxidize H2S to sulfate. Thus, this research revealed the critical role of heterotrophic bacteria in sulfur oxidation in coastal sediments and sea water.",

    "abstract": "In previous studies we determined that the F-box protein Fbp1, a subunit of the SCF(Fbp1) E3 ligase in Cryptococcus neoformans, is essential for fungal pathogenesis. Heat-killed fbp1{Delta} cells (HK-fbp1) can confer vaccine-induced immunity against lethal challenge with clinically important invasive fungal pathogens, e.g., C. neoformans, C. gattii, and Aspergillus fumigatus. In this study, we found that either CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells are sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge of C. neoformans in HK-fbp1 induced-immunity. Given the potent effect of HK-fbp1 as a preventative vaccine, we further tested the potential efficacy of administering HK-fbp1 cells as a therapeutic agent for treating animals after infection. Remarkably, administration of HK-fbp1 provided robust host protection against pre-existing C. neoformans infection. The mice infected with wild type H99 cells and then treated with HK-fbp1 showed significant reduction of fungal CFU in the infected lung, and no dissemination of fungal cells to the brain and spleen. we find that early treatment is critical for the effective use of HK-fbp1 as a therapeutic agent. Immune analysis revealed that early treatment with HK-fbp1 cells elicited Th1 biased protective immune responses that help block fungal dissemination and promote better host protection. Our data thus suggest that HK-fbp1 is both an effective prophylactic vaccine candidate against C. neoformans infection in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations, as well as a potential novel therapeutic strategy to treat early stage cryptococcosis.\n\nImportanceInvasive fungal infections, e.g., cryptococcosis, are often life threatening and difficult to treat with very limited therapeutic options. There is no vaccine available in clinical use to prevent or treat fungal infections. Our previous studies demonstrated that heat-killed fbp1{Delta} cells (HK-fbp1) in Cryptococcus neoformans can be harnessed to confer protection against a challenge by the virulent parental strain, even in immunocompromised animals, such as the ones lacking CD4+ T cells. In this study, we further determined that T cells are required for vaccine-induced protection against homologous challenge and that either CD4+ or CD8+ cells are sufficient. This finding is particularly important for the potential utility of this vaccine candidate in the context of HIV/AIDS-induced immune deficiency, the main risk factor for cryptococcosis in humans. Furthermore, in addition to the utility of HK-fbp1 as a prophylactic vaccine, we found that HK-fbp1 administration can inhibit disease dissemination when animals are treated at an early-stage during Cryptococcus infection. Our findings could significantly expand the utility of HK-fbp1 not only as prophylactic vaccine but also as a novel therapy against cryptococcosis. Conceptually, therapeutic administration of HK-fbp1 could have an advantage over small molecule antifungal drugs in that it is expected to have minimal side effects and lower cost. In all, our studies showed that HK-fbp1 strain can be used both preventively and therapeutically to elicit robust host protection against cryptococcosis.",

As it appears that different mechanisms of magnetoreception in animals evolved from different origins, many questions about the mechanisms remain left open. Here we present new information regarding the Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG) from Kryptopterus vitreolus that may serve as part of the foundation to understanding and applying magnetoreception. Using HaloTag coupled with fluorescent ligands and phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) we show that EPG is associated to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. EPGs function of increasing intracellular calcium was also used to generate an assay using GCaMP6m to observe the function of EPG and to compare its function with homologous proteins. It was also revealed that EPG relies on a motif of three phenylalanine residues in order to function - stably swapping these residues using site directed mutagenesis resulted in a loss of function in EPG.

    "abstract": "C3-C4 intermediate photosynthesis has evolved at least five times convergently in the Brassicaceae, despite this family lacking bona fide C4 species. The establishment of this carbon concentrating mechanism is known to require a complex suite of ultrastructural modifications as well as changes in spatial expression patterns, which are both thought to be underpinned by a reconfiguration of existing gene-regulatory networks. However, to date, the mechanisms which underpin the reconfiguration of these gene networks are largely unknown. In this study, we used a pan-genomic association approach to identify genomic features that could confer differential gene expression toward the C3-C4 intermediate state by analysing eight C3 species and seven C3-C4 species from five independent origins in the Brassicaceae. We found a strong correlation between transposable element (TE) insertions in cis-regulatory regions and the C3-C4 intermediacy. Specifically, our study revealed 113 gene models in which presence of a TE within a gene correlates with C3-C4 intermediate photosynthesis. In this set, genes involved in the photorespiratory glycine shuttle are enriched, including the glycine decarboxylase P-protein whose expression domain undergoes a spatial shift during the transition to C3-C4 photosynthesis. When further interrogating this gene, we discovered independent TE insertions in its upstream region which we conclude to be responsible for causing the spatial shift in GLDP1 gene expression. Our findings hint at a pivotal role of TEs in the evolution of C3-C4 intermediacy, especially in mediating differential spatial gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of many cellular and organismal traits results from poorly understood mechanisms integrating genetic and environmental factors via molecular networks. Here, we show when and how genetic perturbations lead to molecular changes that are confined to small parts of a network versus when they lead to large-scale adaptations of global network states. Integrating multi-omics profiling of genetically heterogeneous budding and fission yeast strains with an array of cellular traits identified a central state transition of the yeast molecular network that is related to PKA and TOR (PT) signaling. Genetic variants affecting this PT state globally shifted the molecular network along a single-dimensional axis, thereby modulating processes including energy- and amino acid metabolism, transcription, translation, cell cycle control and cellular stress response. We propose that genetic effects can propagate through large parts of molecular networks because of the functional requirement to centrally coordinate the activity of fundamental cellular processes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=69 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519111v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d3323org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1185111org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17238c7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1edc6e6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical abstract:C_FLOATNO Genetic variants directly or indirectly affecting the activity of PKA and/or TOR signaling cause global changes of transcriptomic and proteomic network states by modulating the activity of diverse cellular functions and network modules. Using marker genes acting downstream of PKA and TOR signaling we are able to quantify the activity status of combined PKA and TOR signaling (PT Score). This PT Score correlates with major transcriptomic and proteomic changes in response to genetic variability. Those large-scale molecular adaptations correlate with and explain phenotypic consequences for multiple cellular traits. Variants affecting the stoichiometry of proteins within a specific module have regional effects that remain confined to smaller parts of the molecular network. Variants affecting only one or very few proteins change molecular networks only locally. The global reorganization of network states caused by variants of the first type result in consequences for many cellular traits (i.e. pleiotropic effects), such as growth on different carbon sources, stress response, energy metabolism and replicative lifespan.

    "abstract": "Nociceptive habituation is a conserved process through which pain-sensitivity threshold is adjusted based on past sensory experience and which may be dysregulated in human chronic pain conditions. Noxious heat habituation in C. elegans involves the nuclear translocation of CaM kinase-1 (CMK-1) in the FLP thermo-nociceptors neurons, causing reduced animal heat sensitivity and avoidance responses. The phosphorylation of CMK-1 on T179 by CaM kinase kinase-1 (CKK-1) is required for nuclear entry. Recently, we identified a specific Nuclear Export Sequence (NES) required to maintain CMK-1 in the cytoplasm at rest (20 {degrees}C) and showed that Ca2+/CaM binding is sufficient to enhance CMK-1 affinity for IMA-3 via a specific Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) in order to promote nuclear entry after persistent heat stimulation (90 min at 28{degrees}C) (Ippolito et al., 2021). Here, we identified additional functional NES and NLS on CMK-1, whose activity can counteract previously identified elements. Furthermore, we clarify the relationship between the CaM-binding-dependent and T179-dependent effects. T179 phosphorylation can promotes nuclear entry both downstream of CaM-binding and as part of an independent/parallel pathway. Moreover, T179 phosphorylation can also produce the opposite effect by promoting nuclear export. Taken together, our studies show that multiple calcium-dependent regulatory mechanisms converge to bias the activity pattern across a network of NES/NLS elements, in order to activate CMK-1 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, change its localization equilibrium and actuate stimulation-dependent nociceptive plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Patients with cholelithiasis (CL) or cholecystectomy (CE) would have more chances to get colorectal adenoma (CRA) or cancer (CRC). To figure out the effect of gut microbiota and bile acid on colorectal neoplasm in CL and CE patients, we executed a retrospective observational study recruited 463 volunteers, including 182 people with normal gallbladder (Normal), 135 CL and 146 CE patients. The discovery cohort was established to explore the difference of gut microbiota through 16S rRNA sequencing. The validation cohort aimed to verify the results of sequencing through qPCR. Through this research, significant enrichment of Escherichia coli was found in patients with cholelithiasis or cholecystectomy both in discovery cohort (PNormal-CL=0.013; PNormal-CE=0.042) and in validation cohort (PNormal-CL<0.0001; PNormal-CE<0.0001). The relative abundance of Escherichia coli was also increased in CRA and CRC patients (in discovery cohort, PHC-CRA=0.045, PHC-CRC=0.0016; in validation cohort, PHC-CRA=0.0063, PHC-CRC=0.0007). Pks+Escherichia coli was found enriched in CL and CE patients in validation cohort (PNormal-CL<0.0001; PNormal-CE<0.0001). Through KEGG analysis in discovery cohort, the differences of bile acid metabolism were revealed (Ko00120 primary bile acid biosynthesis P=0.014; Ko00121 secondary bile acid biosynthesis P=0.010). In validation cohort, we also found the elevation of serum total bile acid of CE patients (P<0.0001). And the level of serum total bile acid was found associated with the relative abundance of pks+ Escherichia coli (r=0.1895, P=0.0012). In one word, our research found that Escherichia coli, especially pks+ species, was enriched in CL and CE patients. Pks+ Escherichia coli and bile acid metabolism were associated with CRA and CRC in people after cholecystectomy.",

    "abstract": "Efficient nutrient recycling underpins the ecological success of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis in oligotrophic waters. In a stable symbiosis, nitrogen limitation restricts the growth of algal endosymbionts and stimulates their release of photosynthates to the cnidarian animal host. However, the detailed mechanisms controlling nitrogen availability in hospite and their role in symbiosis regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the metabolic regulation of symbiotic nitrogen cycling in the sea anemone Aiptasia by experimentally altering labile carbon availability in a series of experiments. Combining 13C and 15N stable isotope labeling experiments with physiological analyses and NanoSIMS imaging, we show that the competition for environmental ammonium between the host and its algal symbionts is regulated by labile carbon availability. Light regimes optimal for algal photosynthesis increased carbon availability in the holobiont and stimulated nitrogen assimilation in the host metabolism. Consequently, algal symbiont densities were lowest under optimal environmental conditions and increased toward the symbiosiss lower and upper light tolerance limits. This metabolic regulation promotes efficient carbon recycling in a stable symbiosis across a wide range of environmental conditions. At the same time, the dependence on resource competition may favor parasitic interactions explaining the instability of the symbiosis as the environmental conditions in the Anthropocene shift towards its tolerance limits.",

    "abstract": "About half of all forests are tropical and secondary, making tropical forest regeneration integral to future forests. Tree stand biomass and taxonomic richness can recover in a few decades, but relative abundances may lag indefinitely. Since most forests are within a km of a habitat edge, edge effects likely affect community composition regeneration. However, most studies assess how degraded edges affect intact forests, leaving it unclear whether higher-quality edges could facilitate regeneration of nearby degraded forests. Notably, higher quality edges near intact forests could promote processes like dispersal and wood biomass accumulation that effectively accelerate succession, leading to better performance of shade-tolerant taxa compared to pioneer taxa in the early stages of forested plantation regeneration. This study addressed how wet tropical forested plantation regeneration was affected by distance to adjacent intact forest edge. It was hypothesized that old timber plantations facilitate regeneration by increasing available shade, favoring the presence and biomass of later-successional taxa, ultimately changing community composition overall. A wet neotropical timber plantation reforested after 20 years and adjacent to primary forest was censused for trees along a 300 m edge distance gradient, and analysis matched identified taxa to broad dispersal mode and wood density traits using relevant literature.\n\nAs distance from primary forest edge increased, stem and wood density tended to increase significantly, with ~10% variation explained, while biomass and canopy light surprisingly tended to stay the same. Stand tree richness also tended to increase significantly, but diversity decreased steeply and non-linearly, explained in part by wood density, and taxonomic composition varied notably. Finally, tree taxa associated with both early and late successional stages decreased significantly, as well as genus Ficus, but biomass by dispersal mode did not tend to change. Overall this study supports that stand composition is less resilient and more subject to edge effects than biomass and richness, suggesting that global forests will likely be distinctly new assemblages in the future, with timber and biodiversity trade-offs occurring based on local and regional management activity.",

The current version covers the species of the region occurring in Hungary (cc. 90% of the regions flora) and consists of 126,337 records on 2745 taxa. There are 53 plant attributes in PADAPT 1.0 organised in six major groups: (i) Habitus and strategy, (ii) Reproduction, (iii) Kariology, (iv) Distribution and conservation, (v) Ecological indicator values, and (vi) Leaf traits. By including species of the eastern part of Europe not covered by other databases, PADAPT can facilitate studying the flora and vegetation of the eastern part of the continent. Data collection will continue in the future and the PADAPT team welcomes researchers interested in contributing with data. The main task before an updated version of the database is to include species of the Pannonian region not covered by the current version. In conclusion, although data coverage is far from complete, PADAPT meets the longstanding need for a regional database of the Pannonian flora.",

    "abstract": "Through its fermentative capacities, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was central in the development of civilization during the Neolithic period, and the yeast remains of importance in industry and biotechnology giving rise to bona fide domesticated populations. Here, we conduct a population genomic study of domesticated and wild populations of S. cerevisiae. Using coalescent analyses, we report that the effective population size of yeast populations decreased since the divergence with S. paradoxus. We fitted models of distribution of fitness effects to infer the rate of adaptive ({omega}a) and non-adaptive ({omega}na) non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes. We report an overall limited contribution of positive selection to S. cerevisiae protein evolution, albeit with higher rates of adaptive evolution in wild compared to domesticated populations. Our analyses revealed the signature of background selection and possibly Hill-Robertson interference, as recombination was found to be negatively correlated with{omega} na and positively correlated with{omega} a. However, the effect of recombination on{omega} a was found to be labile, as it is only apparent after removing the impact of codon usage bias on the synonymous site frequency spectrum and disappears if we control for the correlation with{omega} na, suggesting it could be an artefact of the decreasing population size. Furthermore, the rate of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions is significantly correlated with the residue solvent exposure, a relation that cannot be explained by the populations demography. Together, our results provide a detailed characterization of adaptive mutations in protein-coding genes across S. cerevisiae populations.",

    "abstract": "Ant colonies ancestrally contained one queen and her non-reproductive workers. This is also the case for many but not all colonies of the Mediterranean big-headed ant Pheidole pallidula. Indeed, this species also has a derived form of social organization with multiple reproductive queens in the colony. The co-existence of two social forms also independently evolved in three other lineages of ants. In each of those lineages, variants of a supergene region of suppressed recombination determine social form. This is likely because supergene regions can link advantageous combinations of alleles from multiple loci. We thus hypothesized that a supergene region also determines colony queen number in the big-headed ant. To test this, we performed extensive population genetic analyses and genomic comparisons. We find no evidence of a supergene-like region with differentiation between single- and multiple-queen colonies. Our results show that a complex social polymorphism can evolve and be maintained without supergenes.",

Understanding the mechanisms of adaptation used by invasive disease vectors in new regions has key implications for mitigating the prevalence and spread of vector-borne disease, although they remain relatively unexplored.\n\nResultsHere, we use whole-genome sequencing data from 103 Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected from various sites in southern and central California to infer the genetic structure of invasive populations. We integrate genome data with 25 topo-climate variables to investigate genome-wide signals of local adaptation among populations. Patterns of population structure, as inferred using principle components and admixture analysis, were consistent with three genetic clusters, likely resulting from multiple independent introductions. Using various landscape genomics approaches, which all remove the confounding effects of shared ancestry on correlations between genetic and environmental variation, we identified 112 genes showing strong signals of local environmental adaptation associated with one or more topo-climate factors. Some of them have known effects in climate adaptation, such as heat-shock proteins, which shows selective sweep and recent positive selection acting on these genomic regions.\n\nConclusionsOur results provide a genome wide perspective on the distribution of adaptive loci and lay the foundation for future work to understand how environmental adaptation in Ae. aegypti impacts the arboviral disease landscape and how such adaptation could help or hinder efforts at population control.",

    "abstract": "Fibrin is a naturally occurring protein network that forms a temporary structure to enable remodeling during wound healing. It is also a common tissue engineering scaffold because the structural properties can be controlled. However, to fully characterize the wound healing process and improve the design of regenerative scaffolds, understanding fibrin mechanics at multiple scales is necessary. Here, we present a strategy to quantify both the macroscale (1 - 10 mm) stress-strain response and the deformation of the mesoscale (10 - 1000 m) network structure during unidirectional tensile tests. The experimental data is then used to inform a computational model to accurately capture the mechanical response of fibrin gels. Simultaneous mechanical testing and confocal microscopy imaging of fluorophore-conjugated fibrin gels revealed up to an 88% decrease in volume coupled with increase in volume fraction in deformed gels, and non-affine fiber alignment in the direction of deformation. Combination of the computational model with finite element analysis enabled us to predict the strain fields that were observed experimentally within heterogenous fibrin gels with spatial variations in material properties. These strategies can be expanded to characterize and predict the macroscale mechanics and mesoscale network organization of other heterogeneous biological tissues and matrices.\n\nStatement of SignificanceFibrin is a naturally-occurring scaffold that supports cellular growth and assembly of de novo tissue and has tunable material properties. Characterization of meso- and macro-scale mechanics of fibrin gel networks can advance understanding of the wound healing process and impact future tissue engineering approaches. Using structural and mechanical characteristics of fibrin gels, a theoretical and computational model that can predict multiscale fibrin network mechanics was developed. These data and model can be used to design gels with tunable properties.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentifying the B-cell epitopes is an essential step for guiding rational vaccine development and immunotherapies. Due to experimental approaches being expensive and time-consuming, many computational methods have been designed to assist B-cell epitope prediction. However, existing sequence-based methods have limited performance since they only use contextual features of the sequential neighbors while neglecting structural information.\n\nResultsBased on the recent breakthrough of AlphaFold2 in protein structure prediction, we propose GraphBepi, a novel graph-based model for accurate B-cell epitope prediction. GraphBepi first generates the effective information sequence representations and protein structures from antigen sequences through the pretrained language model and AlphaFold2, respectively. GraphBepi then applies the edge-enhanced deep graph neural network (EGNN) to capture the spatial information from predicted protein structures and leverages the bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks (BiLSTM) to capture long-range dependencies from sequences. The low-dimensional representation learned by EGNN and BiLSTM is then combined to predict B-cell epitopes through a multilayer perceptron. Through comprehensive tests on the curated epitope dataset, GraphBepi was shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods by more than 5.5% and 44.0% in terms of AUC and AUPR, respectively.

    "abstract": "Cellular signalling generates calcium (Ca2+) ions, which are ubiquitous secondary messengers decoded by calcium-dependent protein kinases, calcineurins, calreticulin, calmodulins (CAMs) and CAM-binding proteins. Previous studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have shown the critical roles of the CAM-BINDING PROTEIN 60 (CBP60) protein family in plant growth, stress responses and immunity. Certain CBP60 factors can regulate plant immune responses, like pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity, and synthesis of major plant immune-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). Although homologous CBP60 sequences have been identified in the plant kingdom, their function and regulation in most species remain unclear. In this paper, we specifically characterized 11 members of the CBP60 family in the agriculturally important crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Protein sequence analyses revealed that three CBP60 homologs have the closest amino acid identity to Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1, master transcription factors involved in plant immunity. Strikingly, AlphaFold deep learning-assisted prediction of protein structures highlighted close structural similarity between these tomato and Arabidopsis CBP60 homologs. Conserved domain analyses revealed that they possess CAM-binding domains and DNA-binding domains, reflecting their potential involvement in linking Ca2+ signalling and transcriptional regulation in tomato plants. In terms of their gene expression profiles under biotic (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 pathogen infection) and/or abiotic stress (warming temperatures), five tomato CBP60 genes were pathogen-responsive and temperature-sensitive, reminiscent of Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1. Overall, we present a genome-wide identification of the CBP60 gene/protein family in tomato plants, and we provide evidence on their regulation and potential function as Ca2+-sensing transcriptional regulators.",

    "abstract": "The tick, Ixodes scapularis, vectors pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme Disease. Over the last few decades I. scapularis has expanded its range, introducing a novel health threat into these areas. Warming temperatures appear to be one cause of its range expansion to the north. However, other factors are also involved. We show that unfed adult female ticks infected with B. burgdorferi have greater overwintering survival than uninfected female ticks. Locally collected adult female ticks were placed in individual microcosms and allowed to overwinter in both forest and dune grass environments. In the spring we collected the ticks and tested both dead and living ticks for B. burgdorferi DNA. Infected ticks had greater overwintering survival compared with uninfected ticks every winter for three consecutive winters in both forest and dune grass environments. We discuss the most plausible explanations for this result. The increased winter survival of adult female ticks could enhance tick population growth. Our results suggest that, in addition to climate change, B. burgdorferi infection itself may be promoting the northern range expansion of I. scapularis. Our study highlights how pathogens could work synergistically with climate change to promote host range expansion.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria provide essential metabolites and ATP for the regulation of energy homeostasis. For instance, liver mitochondria are a vital source of gluconeogenic precursors under a fasted state. However, the regulatory mechanisms at the level of mitochondrial membrane transport are not fully understood. Here, we report a liver-specific mitochondrial inner-membrane carrier, SLC25A47, which is required for hepatic gluconeogenesis and energy homeostasis. Genome-wide association studies found significant associations between SLC25A47 and fasting glucose, HbA1c, and cholesterol levels in humans. In mice, we demonstrated that liver-specific deletion of Slc25a47 impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis selectively from lactate, while significantly enhancing whole-body energy expenditure and the hepatic expression of FGF21. These metabolic changes were not a consequence of general liver dysfunction because acute SLC25A47 deletion in adult mice was sufficient to enhance hepatic FGF21 production, pyruvate tolerance, and insulin tolerance independent of liver damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, SLC25A47 loss leads to impaired hepatic pyruvate flux and malate accumulation in the mitochondria, thereby restricting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Together, the present study identified a crucial node in the mitochondrial inner-membrane that regulates fasting-induced gluconeogenesis and energy homeostasis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEGiven the impenetrable nature of the mitochondrial inner-membrane, most of the known metabolite carrier proteins, including SLC25A family members, are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues. One exception is SLC25A47 which is selectively expressed in the liver. The present study showed that depletion of SLC25A47 reduced mitochondrial pyruvate flux and hepatic gluconeogenesis under a fasted state, while activating energy expenditure. The present work offers a liver-specific target through which we can restrict hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is often in excess under hyperglycemic and diabetic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Tree species are suffering from changing and stressful environmental conditions worldwide. Fagus sylvatica L., one of the most common Central European deciduous tree species showed symptoms of crown damage, a reduction in growth and increased mortality following the severe recent drought years. For Germany Fagus orientalis Lipsky, a closely related species with higher drought tolerance, originating from south-eastern Europe, Turkey, the Greater Caucasus region and the Hyrcanian forest, has been proposed as an alternative with high future potential. The translocation of pre-adapted planting material has been proposed as a tool to mitigate negative effects of climate change. This approach can be beneficial but might also harbor risks.\n\nTaking advantage of F. orientalis trees planted over 100 years ago in the forest district of Memsen, Germany, we set out to study admixture between the two beech species and the direction of gene flow. Furthermore, we used a range-wide dataset of F. sylvatica and F. orientalis provenances to determine the origin of the introduced trees. Using a combination of nuclear EST-SSRs and one chloroplast SSR marker with species-specific variants, we could show that interspecific gene flow was going in both directions. In most cases, F. sylvatica was the pollen donor which is likely explained by the higher abundance of this species producing vast amounts of pollen. The planted trees originated from the Greater Caucasus region and showed strong genetic divergence from German F. sylvatica populations. In the future, gene flow patterns as well as hybrid performance from different provenances should be tested in additional stands and in comparison to F. sylvatica provenances from southern Europe to assess the suitability of Oriental beech for the mitigation of climate change impacts.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is associated with changes in the cellular composition of the immune system. During ageing, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that produce immune cells are thought to decline in their regenerative capacity. However, HSPC function has been mostly assessed using transplantation assays, and it remains unclear how HSPCs age in the native bone marrow niche. To address this issue, we developed a novel in situ single cell lineage tracing technology to quantify the clonal composition and cell production of single cells in their native niche. Our results demonstrate that a pool of HSPCs with unequal output maintains myelopoiesis through overlapping waves of cell production throughout adult life. During ageing, the increased frequency of myeloid cells is explained by greater numbers of HSPCs contributing to myelopoiesis, rather than increased myeloid output of individual HSPCs. Strikingly, the myeloid output of HSPCs remained constant over time despite accumulating significant transcriptomic changes throughout adulthood. Together, these results show that, unlike emergency myelopoiesis post-transplantation, aged HSPCs in their native microenvironment do not functionally decline in their regenerative capacity.",

    "abstract": "Does environmental DNA (eDNA) correlate more closely with numerical abundance (N) or biomass in aquatic organisms? We hypothesize that the answer is  neither: eDNA production likely scales allometrically, reflecting key physiological rates and surface area-to-body mass relationships. Building on individual-level frameworks developed from the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, we derive a framework through which quantitative eDNA data can be transformed to simultaneously reflect both population-level N and biomass. We then validated our framework using data from two previously published studies: (i) a marine eDNA metabarcoding dataset; and (ii) a freshwater single-species qPCR dataset. Using a Bayesian modeling approach, we estimated the value of the allometric scaling coefficient that jointly optimized the relationship between N, biomass, and  corrected eDNA data to be 0.82 and 0.77 in Case Studies (i) and (ii), respectively. These estimates closely match expected scaling coefficients estimated in previous work on Teleost fish metabolic rates. We also demonstrate that correcting quantitative eDNA can significantly improve correspondence between eDNA- and traditionally-derived quantitative community biodiversity metrics (e.g., Shannon index and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) under some circumstances. Collectively, we show that quantitative eDNA data is unlikely to correspond exactly to either N or biomass, but can be  corrected to reflect both through our unifying joint modelling framework. This framework can also be further expanded to include other variables that might impact eDNA pseudo-steady-state concentrations in natural ecosystems (e.g., temperature, pH, and phenology), and is flexible enough to model these relationships across trophic levels.\n\nSignificance StatementAquatic animals release DNA (from shed cells, mucous, faeces, etc.) into water, which can be detected via environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling. What is less clear is whether we can estimate numerical abundance (N) or biomass from eDNA concentrations. We hypothesize that eDNA production scales allometrically; that is, large animals release less DNA per unit mass than smaller animals. Building from the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, we derived a framework through which eDNA data can be transformed to simultaneously reflect both N and biomass. We then validated the framework using two case studies in marine and freshwater systems. This framework unifies discrepancies between eDNA, N, and biomass data, unlocking the potential of eDNA to monitor population abundance/biomass and quantify biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Fission yeasts are an ancient group of fungal species that diverged from each other from tens to hundreds of million years ago. Among them is the preeminent model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which has significantly contributed to our understandings of molecular mechanisms underlying fundamental cellular processes. The availability of the genomes of S. pombe and three other fission yeast species S. japonicus, S. octosporus, and S. cryophilus has enabled cross-species comparisons that provide insights into the evolution of genes, pathways, and genomes. Here, we performed genome sequencing on the type strain of the recently identified fission yeast species S. osmophilus and obtained a complete mitochondrial genome and a nuclear genome assembly with gaps only at rRNA gene arrays. A total of 5098 protein-coding nuclear genes were annotated and orthologs for more than 95% of them were identified. Genome-based phylogenetic analysis showed that S. osmophilus is most closely related to S. octosporus and these two species diverged around 16 million years ago. To demonstrate the utility of this S. osmophilus reference genome, we conducted cross-species comparative analyses of centromeres, telomeres, transposons, the mating-type region, Cbp1 family proteins, and mitochondrial genomes. These analyses revealed conservation of repeat arrangements and sequence motifs in centromere cores, identified telomeric sequences composed of two types of repeats, delineated relationships among Tf1/sushi group retrotransposons, characterized the evolutionary origins and trajectories of Cbp1 family domesticated transposases, and discovered signs of interspecific transfer of two types of mitochondrial selfish elements.",

    "abstract": "In resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), the global signal average captures widespread fluctuations related to unwanted sources of variance such as motion and respiration, and has long been used as a regressor to reduce noise during data preprocessing. However, coherent neural activity in spatially-extended functional networks can also contribute to the global signal. The relative contributions of neural and non-neural sources to the global signal remain poorly understood. This study sought to tackle this problem through the comparison of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) global signal to an adjacent non-brain tissue signal from the same scan in rs-fMRI obtained from anesthetized rats. In this dataset motion was minimal and ventilation was phase-locked to image acquisition to minimize respiratory fluctuations. In addition to contrasting the spatial and spectral components of these two signals, we also observed these differences across the use of three different anesthetics: isoflurane, dexmedetomidine, and a combination of dexmedetomidine and light isoflurane. Here, we report differences in the spectral composition of the two signals as evaluated by a power spectral density (PSD) estimate and a fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) calculation. Additionally, we show spatial selectivity for specific brain structures that show an increased correlation to the global signal both statically and dynamically, through Pearsons correlation and co-activation pattern analysis, respectively. All of the observed differences between the BOLD global signal and the adjacent non-brain tissue signal were maintained across all three anesthetic conditions, showing that the global signal is distinct from the noise contained in the tissue signal. This study provides a unique perspective to the contents of the global signal and their origins.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe accuracy gap between predicted and experimental structures has been significantly reduced following the development of AlphaFold2. However, for further studies, such as drug discovery and protein design, AlphaFold2 structures need to be representative of proteins in solution, yet AlphaFold2 was trained to generate only a few structural conformations rather than a conformational landscape. In previous CASP experiments, MD simulation-based methods have been widely used to improve the accuracy of single 3D models. However, these methods are highly computationally intensive and less applicable for practical use in large-scale applications. Despite this, the refinement concept can still provide a better understanding of conformational dynamics and improve the quality of 3D models at a modest computational cost. Here, our ReFOLD4 pipeline was adopted to provide the conformational landscape of AlphaFold2 predictions while maintaining high model accuracy. In addition, the AlphaFold2 recycling process was utilised to improve 3D models by using them as custom template inputs for tertiary and quaternary structure predictions.\n\nResultsAccording to the Molprobity score, 94% of the generated 3D models by ReFOLD4 were improved. As measured by average change in lDDT, AlphaFold2 recycling showed an improvement rate of 87.5% (using MSAs) and 81.25% (using single sequences) for monomeric AF2 models and 100% (MSA) and 97.8% (single sequence) for monomeric non-AF2 models. By the same measure, the recycling of multimeric models showed an improvement rate of as much as 80% for AF2 models and 94% for non-AF2 models. The AlphaFold2 recycling processes and ReFOLD4 method can be combined very efficiently to provide conformational landscapes at the AlphaFold2-accuracy level, while also significantly improving the global quality of 3D models for both tertiary and quaternary structures, with much less computational complexity than traditional refinement methods.",

    "abstract": "Protein folding problem obtained a practical solution recently, owing to advances in deep learning. There are classes of proteins though, such as antibodies, that are structurally unique, where the general solution still lacks. In particular, the prediction of the CDR-H3 loop, which is an instrumental part of an antibody in its antigen recognition abilities, remains a challenge. Antibody-specific deep learning frameworks were proposed to tackle this problem noting great progress, both on accuracy and speed fronts. Oftentimes though, the original networks produce physically implausible bond geometries that then need to undergo a time-consuming energy minimization process. Here we hypothesized that pre-training the network on a large, augmented set of models with correct physical geometries, rather than a small set of real antibody X-ray structures, would allow the network to learn better bond geometries. We show that fine-tuning such a pre-trained network on a task of shape prediction on real X-ray structures improves the number of correct peptide bond distances. We further demonstrate that pre-training allows the network to produce physically plausible shapes on an artificial set of CDR-H3s, showing the ability to generalize to the vast antibody sequence space. We hope that our strategy will benefit the development of deep learning antibody models that rapidly generate physically plausible geometries, without the burden of time-consuming energy minimization.",

SARS-CoV-2 employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for entry into lung cells and TMPRSS2 inhibitors are being developed for COVID-19 therapy. However, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, which currently dominates the pandemic, prefers the endo/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L over TMPRSS2 for cell entry, raising doubts whether TMPRSS2 inhibitors would be suitable for treatment of patients infected with the Omicron variant. Nevertheless, the contribution of TMPRSS2 to spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the infected host is largely unclear. Here, we show that loss of TMPRSS2 strongly reduced the replication of the Beta variant in nose, trachea and lung of C57BL mice and protected the animals from weight loss and disease. Infection of mice with the Omicron variant did not cause disease, as expected, but again TMPRSS2 was essential for efficient viral spread in the upper and lower respiratory tract. These results identify a key role of TMPRSS2 in SARS-CoV-2 Beta and Omicron infection and highlight TMPRSS2 as an attractive target for antiviral intervention.",

    "abstract": "Host-viral interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed to understand COVID-19 pathogenesis and may help to guide the design of novel antiviral therapeutics. N6-methyladenosine modification (m6A), one of the most abundant cellular RNA modifications, regulates key processes in RNA metabolism during a stress response. Gene expression profiles observed post-infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants show changes in the expression of genes related to RNA catabolism, including m6A readers and erasers. We found that infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants caused a loss of m6A in cellular RNAs, whereas m6A was detected abundantly in viral RNA. METTL3, the m6A methyltransferase, showed an unusual cytoplasmic localization post-infection. The B.1.351 variant had a less pronounced effect on METTL3 localization and loss of m6A than the B.1 and B.1.1.7 variants. We also observed a loss of m6A upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in air/liquid interface cultures of human airway epithelia, confirming that m6A loss is characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Further, transcripts with m6A modification were preferentially down-regulated post-infection. Inhibition of the export protein XPO1 resulted in the restoration of METTL3 localization, recovery of m6A on cellular RNA, and increased mRNA expression. Stress granule formation, which was compromised by SARS-CoV-2 infection, was restored by XPO1 inhibition and accompanied by a reduced viral infection in vitro. Together, our study elucidates how SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the stress response and perturbs cellular gene expression in an m6A-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) offers an efficient way to repress genes of interest, and it is widely used in research settings. Clinical applications emerged more recently, with 5 approved siRNAs (the RNA guides of the RNAi effector complex) against human diseases. The development of siRNAs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus could therefore provide the basis of novel COVID-19 treatments, while being easily adaptable to future variants or to other, unrelated viruses. Because the biochemistry of RNAi is very precisely described, it is now possible to design siRNAs with high predicted activity and specificity using only computational tools. While previous siRNA design algorithms tended to rely on simplistic strategies (raising fully complementary siRNAs against targets of interest), our approach uses the most up-to-date mechanistic description of RNAi to allow mismatches at tolerable positions and to force them at beneficial positions, while optimizing siRNA duplex asymmetry. Our pipeline proposes 8 siRNAs against SARS-CoV-2, and ex vivo assessment confirms the high antiviral activity of 6 out of 8 siRNAs, also achieving excellent variant coverage (with several 3-siRNA combinations recognizing each correctly-sequenced variant as of September 2022). Our approach is easily generalizable to other viruses as long as a variant genome database is available. With siRNA delivery procedures being currently improved, RNAi could therefore become an efficient and versatile antiviral therapeutic strategy.",

We consider direct and indirect transmission pathways by modeling four scenarios with livestock and mammalian wildlife as potential and known reservoirs before examining how access to healthcare varies within clusters and scenarios. We found 19 clusters with differing risk factor contributions within a single country (N=9) or transboundary (N=10). High-risk areas were mainly closer (11-20%) rather than far (<1%) from healthcare. Areas far from healthcare reveal healthcare access inequalities, especially Scenario 3, which includes wild mammals as secondary hosts.

    "abstract": "The capacity of ectotherms to adjust their thermal tolerance limits through evolution or acclimation seems relatively modest and highly variable, and we lack satisfying explanations for both findings given a limited understanding of what ultimately determines an organisms thermal tolerance. Here, we test if the amount of heating an ectotherm tolerates throughout a heating event until organismal failure scales with temperatures non-linear influence on biological rates. To account for the non-linear influence of temperature on biological rates on heating tolerance, we rescaled the duration of heating events of 316 ectothermic taxa acclimated to different temperatures and describe the biological rate-corrected heating duration. This rescaling reveals that the capacity of an organism to resist a heating event is in fact remarkably constant across any acclimation temperature, enabling high-precision estimates of how organismal thermal tolerance limits vary under different thermal regimes. We also find that faster heating consistently reduces biological rate-corrected heating durations, which helps further explain why thermal tolerance limits seem so variable on absolute temperature scales. Existing paradigms are that heating tolerances and thermal tolerance limits reflect incomplete metabolic compensatory responses, are constrained by evolutionary conservatism, or index failure of systems such as membrane function; our data provide a different perspective and show that an organisms thermal tolerance emerges from the interaction between the non-linear thermal dependence of biological rates and heating durations, which is an approximately-fixed property of a species.",

    "abstract": "O_LIMotivation Under favourable conditions DNA molecules can persist for hundreds of thousands of years. Such genetic remains make up invaluable resources to study past assemblages, populations, and even the evolution of species. However, DNA is subject to degradation, and hence over time decrease to ultra low concentrations which makes it highly prone to contamination by modern sources. Strict precautions are therefore necessary to ensure that DNA from modern sources does not appear in the final data is authenticated as ancient. The most generally accepted and widely applied authenticity for ancient DNA studies is to test for elevated deaminated cytosine residues towards the termini of the molecules: DNA damage. To date, this has primarily been used for single organisms and recently for read assemblies, however, these methods are not applicable for estimating DNA damage for ancient metagenomes with tens and even hundreds of thousands of species.\nC_LIO_LIMethods We present metaDMG, a novel framework and toolkit that allows for the estimation, quantification and visualization of postmortem damage for single reads, single genomes and even metagenomic environmental DNA by utilizing the taxonomic branching structure. It bypasses any need for initial classification, splitting reads by individual organisms, and realignment. We have implemented a Bayesian approach that combines a modified geometric damage profile with a beta-binomial model to fit the entire model to the individual misincorporations at all taxonomic levels.\nC_LIO_LIResults We evaluated the performance using both simulated and published environmental DNA datasets and compared to existing methods when relevant. We find metaDMG to be an order of magnitude faster than previous methods and more accurate - even for complex metagenomes. Our simulations show that metaDMG can estimate DNA damage at taxonomic levels down to 100 reads, that the estimated uncertainties decrease with increased number of reads and that the estimates are more significant with increased number of C to T misincorporations.\nC_LIO_LIConclusion metaDMG is a state-of-the-art program for aDNA damage estimation and allows for the computation of nucleotide misincorporation, GC-content, and DNA fragmentation for both simple and complex ancient genomic datasets, making it a complete package for ancient DNA damage authentication.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "MotivationSARS-CoV-2 wastewater samples are extensively collected and studied because it allows quantitatively assess a viral load in surrounding populations. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 strain deconvolution gives more insights into pandemic dynamics, and the uprising of new strains. Usually, the solution to the strain deconvolution problem starts with read alignment of wastewater short read sequencing data to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. After variants are called and their abundances are estimated, a reference database is used to assign variants to strains, select a subset of strains, and infer relative abundance of these strains based on some mathematical model. Assembly-based methods have its own strengths, but currently reside in the shadow of alignment-based methods.\n\nResultsIn this paper we propose a new assembly-based approach based on SPAdes toolkit codebase --- wastewaterSPAdes, that is able to deconvolve wastewater without a need of read alignment. Our results show that watewaterSPAdes is able to accurately identify strains presented in a sample, and correctly estimate abundances for most of the samples.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://cab.spbu.ru/software/wastewaterspades/\n\nContacta.korobeynikov@spbu.ru\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, with no current cure. Consequently, alternative approaches focusing on early pathological events in specific neuronal populations, besides targeting the well-studied Amyloid beta (A{beta}) accumulations and Tau tangles, are needed. In this study, we have investigated disease phenotypes specific to glutamatergic forebrain neurons and mapped the timeline of their occurrence, by implementing familial and sporadic human induced pluripotent stem cell models as well as the 5xFAD mouse model. We recapitulated characteristic late AD disease phenotypes, such as increased A{beta} secretion and Tau hyperphosphorylation, as well as previously well documented mitochondrial and synaptic deficits. Intriguingly, we identified Golgi fragmentation as one of the earliest AD phenotypes, indicating potential impairments in protein processing and post-translational modifications. Computational analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed differentially expressed genes involved in glycosylation and glycan patterns, whilst total glycan profiling revealed minor glycosylation differences. This indicates general robustness of glycosylation besides the observed fragmented morphology. Importantly, we identified that genetic variants in Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) associated with AD could aggravate the Golgi fragmentation and subsequent glycosylation changes. In summary, we identified Golgi fragmentation as one of the earliest disease phenotypes in AD neurons in various in vivo and in vitro complementary disease models, which can be exacerbated via additional risk variants in SORL1.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519571v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@98a8eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7aa7b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@991e33org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8dabb4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Strong inhibitory recurrent connections can reduce the tendency for a neural network to become unstable. This is known as inhibitory stabilization; networks that are unstable in the absence of strong inhibitory feedback because of their unstable excitatory recurrent connections are known as Inhibition Stabilized Networks (ISNs). One of the characteristics of ISNs is their \"paradoxical response\", where perturbing the inhibitory neurons with additional excitatory input results in a decrease in their activity after a temporal delay instead of increasing their activity. Here, we develop a model of populations of neurons across different layers of cortex. Within each layer, there is one population of inhibitory neurons and one population of excitatory neurons. The connectivity weights across different populations in the model are derived from a synaptic physiology database provided by the Allen Institute. The model shows a gradient of excitation-inhibition balance across different layers in the cortex, where superficial layers are more inhibitory dominated compared to deeper layers. To investigate the presence of ISNs across different layers, we measured the membrane potentials of neural populations in the model after perturbing inhibitory populations. The results show that layer 2/3 in the model does not operate in the ISN regime but layers 4 and 5 do operate in the ISN regime. These results accord with neurophysiological findings that explored the presence of ISNs across different layers in the cortex. The results show that there may be a systematic macroscopic gradient of inhibitory stabilization across different layers in the cortex that depends on the level of excitation-inhibition balance, and that the strength of the paradoxical response increases as the model moves closer to bifurcation points.\n\nAuthor summaryStrong feedback inhibition prevents neural networks from becoming unstable. Inhibition Stabilized Networks (ISNs) have strong inhibitory connections combined with high levels of unstable excitatory recurrent connections. In the absence of strong inhibitory feedback, ISNs become unstable. ISNs demonstrate a paradoxical effect: perturbing inhibitory neurons in an ISN by increasing their excitatory input results in a decrease in their activity after a temporal delay instead of increasing their activity. Here, we developed a neural mass model of a cortical column based on neurophysiological data. The model shows a gradual change in inhibitory stabilization across different layers in the cortex where layer 2/3 is less inhibitory stabilized and shows no paradoxical effect in contrast to layer 4 and layer 5, which operate in the ISN regime and show paradoxical responses to perturbation.",

    "abstract": "The spectral formant structure and periodicity pitch are the major features that determine the identity of vowels and the characteristics of the speaker. However, very little is known about how the processing of these features in the auditory cortex changes during development. To address this question, we independently manipulated the periodicity and formant structure of vowels while measuring auditory cortex responses using MEG in children aged 7-12 years and adults. We analyzed the sustained negative shift of source current associated with these vowel properties, which was present in the auditory cortex in both age groups despite differences in the transient components of the auditory response. In adults, the sustained activation associated with formant structure was lateralized to the left hemisphere early in the auditory processing stream requiring neither attention nor semantic mapping. This lateralization was not yet established in children, in whom the right hemisphere contribution to formant processing was strong and decreased during or after puberty. In contrast to the formant structure, periodicity was associated with a greater response in the right hemisphere in both children and adults. These findings suggest that left-lateralization for the automatic processing of vowel formant structure emerges relatively late in ontogenesis and pose a serious challenge to current theories of hemispheric specialization for speech processing.",

Mathematical models can help understand such a complex problem by providing a way to explore and conceptualize principles, merging biological knowledge with experimental data into a model amenable to simulation and external validation, all without the need for extensive clinical trials.\n\nWe performed a scoping review of mathematical models of AD with a search strategy applied to the PubMed database which yielded 846 entries. After applying our exclusion criteria, only 17 studies remained from which we extracted data, focusing on three aspects of mathematical modeling: how authors addressed continuous time, how models were solved, and how the high dimensionality and non-linearity of models were managed. Most articles modeled AD at the cellular range of the disease process, operating on a short time scale (e.g., minutes; hours), i.e., the micro view (12/17); the rest considered regional or brain-level processes, with longer timescales (e.g., years, decades) (the macro view). Most papers were concerned primarily with A{beta} (n = 8), few modeled with both A{beta} and tau proteins (n = 3), and some considered more than these two factors in the model (n = 6). Models used partial differential equations (PDEs; n = 3), ordinary differential equations (ODEs; n = 7), both PDEs and ODEs (n = 3). Some didnt specify the mathematical formalism (n = 4). Sensitivity analyses were performed in only a small number of papers (4/17).\n\nOverall, we found that only two studies could be considered valid in terms of parameters and conclusions, and two more were partially valid. The majority (n = 13) either was invalid or there was insufficient information to ascertain their status. While mathematical models are powerful and useful tools for the study of AD, closer attention to reporting is necessary to gauge the quality of published studies to replicate or continue with their contributions.",

    "abstract": "Backgroundt-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a method for reducing high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional representation and is mostly used for visualizing data. In parametric t-SNE, a neural network learns to reproduce this mapping. When used for EEG analysis, the data is usually first transformed into a set of features, but it is not known which features are optimal.\n\nNew methodThe principle of t-SNE was used to train convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders to learn to produce both a high- and a low-dimensional representation, eliminating the need for feature engineering. A simple neighbor distribution based on ranked distances was used for the high-dimensional representation instead of the traditional normal distribution. To evaluate the method, the Temple University EEG Corpus was used to create three datasets with distinct EEG characters: 1) wakefulness and sleep, 2) interictal epileptiform discharges, and 3) seizure activity.\n\nResultsThe CNN encoders for the three datasets produced low-dimensional representations of the datasets with a global and local structure that conformed well to the EEG characters and generalized to new data.\n\nComparison to existing methodsCompared to parametric t-SNE for either a short-time Fourier transforms or wavelet representation of the datasets, the developed CNN encoders performed equally well but generally produced a higher degree of clustering.\n\nConclusionsThe developed principle is promising and could be further developed to create general tools for exploring relations in EEG data, e.g., visual summaries of recordings, and trends for continuous EEG monitoring. It might also be used to generate features for other types of machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Gc) is a human-specific pathogen that causes the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea. Gc survives in neutrophil-rich gonorrheal secretions, and recovered bacteria predominantly express phase-variable, surface-expressed opacity-associated (Opa) proteins (Opa+). However, expression of Opa proteins like OpaD decreases Gc survival when exposed to human neutrophils ex vivo. Here, we made the unexpected observation that incubation with normal human serum, which is found in inflamed mucosal secretions, enhances survival of Opa+ Gc from primary human neutrophils. We directly linked this phenomenon to a novel complement-independent function for C4b-binding protein (C4BP). When bound to the bacteria, C4BP was necessary and sufficient to suppress Gc-induced neutrophil reactive oxygen species production and prevent neutrophil phagocytosis of Opa+ Gc. This research identifies for the first time a complement-independent role for C4BP in enhancing the survival of a pathogenic bacterium from phagocytes, thereby revealing how Gc exploits inflammatory conditions to persist at human mucosal surfaces.\n\nAuthor SummaryGonorrhea is considered an urgent threat to public health with an estimated 98 million cases occurring annually worldwide, growing antimicrobial resistance, and the absence of a gonococcal vaccine. Currently, we do not understand how N. gonorrhoeae expressing opacity (Opa) proteins survive neutrophil defenses and are recovered viable from infected patients. Here, we investigated how soluble elements of gonorrhea infection, present in human serum, contribute to N. gonorrhoeae survival from neutrophils. We found that the serum component C4b-binding protein (C4BP) protects N. gonorrhoeae from neutrophil killing and suppresses neutrophil activation. C4BP limited neutrophil phagocytosis of N. gonorrhoeae that expressed Opa proteins that bound to neutrophil receptors of the CEACAM family. This work provides novel insight into the interplay between the noncellular and cellular aspects of the innate immune response to N. gonorrhoeae.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia opens trap formation in the nematode-trapping (NT) fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora, an intriguing morphological switch in NT fungi, where saprophytic mycelia are converted to pathogenic organs. Endocytosis plays a prominent role in nutrient uptake, signaling cascades, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis in higher eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that ammonia efficiently promotes endocytosis via the formation of 3D-adhesive mycelial nets in A. oligospora. Trap production is followed by the presence of massive multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and membrane rupture and repair. Additionally, both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the endosomal sorting complex for transport (ESCRT) pathway are immediately linked to endocytosis regulation and MVB formation in ammonia-induced trap formation. Moreover, disruption of the ESCRT-1 complex subunit proteins AoHse and AoVps27 led to the complete loss of membrane endocytosis and trap formation. Finally, the deletion of the deubiquitinase AoSst2 caused a significant reduction in the number of trap structures produced in response to exposure to ammonia or nematodes. Overall, our results increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic changes in the NT fungal group, demonstrating that the endocytosis-ESCRT-MVB pathway participates in the regulation of trapping organs.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe lifestyle switch of nematode-trapping (NT) fungi is a significant event that increases their pathogenicity to nematode prey, which has resulted in large losses to agricultural crops worldwide. Here, we describe the molecular mechanism underlying how this fungal group forms a NT structure in response to ammonia, a widely preferred nitrogen source in soil niches. Ammonia enhances the endocytosis process, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and endosomal sorting complex for transport (ESCRT) pathway of the model NT fungus A. oligospora, thereby generating enriched multivesicular bodies (MVBs) during trap formation. In this process, the cell membrane morphology is remarkably damaged and then repaired. We further found that disruption of the ESCRT-0 subcomplex or ubiquitinase severely blocked trap production and membrane reorganization. Our study provides a new understanding of endocytosis-ESCRT-MVB flux in the transition of fungal NT organs.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to changing environments often requires meaningful phenotypic modifications to match the current conditions. However, obtaining information about the surroundings during an organisms own lifetime may only permit accommodating relatively late developmental modifications. Therefore, it may be advantageous to rely on inter-generational or trans-generational cues that provide information about the environment as early as possible to allow development along an optimal trajectory. Transfer of information or resources across generations, known as parental effects, is well documented in animals and plants but not in other eukaryotes, such as fungi. Understanding parental effects and their evolutionary consequences in fungi is of vital importance as they perform crucial ecosystem functions. In this study, we investigated whether parental effects are present in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, how long do they last, are the effects adaptive, and what is their mechanism. We performed a fully factorial match / mismatch experiment for a good and poor quality environment, in which we measured mycelium size of strains that experienced either a matched or mismatched environment in their previous generation. We found a strong silver spoon effect in initial mycelium growth, which lasted for one generation, and increased fitness during competition experiments. By using deletion mutants that lacked key genes in epigenetic processes, we show that epigenetic mechanisms are not involved in this effect. Instead, we show that spore glycogen content, glucose availability and a radical transcription shift in spores are the main mechanisms behind this parental effect.",

    "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is increasing globally, with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) accounting for 80% of cases and Mycobacterium abscessus among the next most prevalent pathogens. Current treatment necessitates long-term administration of poorly tolerated and modestly effective antibiotic combinations, highlighting the need for new oral agents. SPR719, the active moiety of the benzimidazole phosphate prodrug SPR720, inhibits the ATPase subunits of DNA gyrase B, a target with no human homolog and not exploited by current antibiotics. We demonstrated SPR719 activity against MAC (MIC90, 2 {micro}g/mL) and M. abscessus clinical isolates (MIC90, 4 {micro}g/mL), including those resistant to current standard-of-care (SOC) agents. In vivo efficacy of SPR720 was demonstrated against M. avium ATCC 700898 in a chronic C3HeB/FeJ murine model of pulmonary infection, both as a monotherapy and in combination with clarithromycin, ethambutol and rifabutin. SPR720 monotherapy exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in bacterial burden, with the largest reduction observed when combined with clarithromycin and ethambutol. Efficacy of SPR720 was also demonstrated against M. abscessus subspecies abscessus 1513, a virulent multidrug-resistant strain in a prolonged acute model of pulmonary infection in mice. SPR720 monotherapy exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in bacterial burden with further reductions when combined with SOC agents, clarithromycin and amikacin {+/-} clofazimine. Taken together, the in vitro activity of SPR720 against common NTM pathogens in concert with the proof-of-concept efficacy in murine infection models warrants the continued clinical evaluation of SPR720 as a new oral option for the treatment of NTM-PD.",

    "abstract": "Many psychiatric diseases including depression, schizophrenia and anxiety have been associated with serotonin (5-HT) neuron dysfunction. Pacemaker-like firing of raphe 5-HT neurons was proposed to be under unique 5-HT1A receptor-mediated autoinhibition. We previously showed that 5-HT2B receptors were expressed by 5-HT neurons together with 5-HT1A receptors. However, functional consequences on 5-HT neurons of putative interaction between these receptors are unknown. Using co-immunoprecipitation, BRET, confocal and super-resolution microscopy in hippocampal and 5-HT neurons, we present converging evidence that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors can form heterodimers and co-cluster at the surface of dendrites. 5-HT2B receptor clusters were redistributed upon 5-HT1A receptor expression supporting functional interactions between the two receptors. Furthermore, 5-HT2B receptor expression prevented agonist-induced internalization of 5-HT1A receptors, whereas 5-HT1A receptors mimicked the clustering effect of 5-HT2B receptor stimulation on its surface expression. The functional impact of this interaction in-vivo was assessed by recording 5-HT neuron excitability from mice lacking 5-HT2B receptors in 5-HT neurons. Upon 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, the firing activity of 5-HT neurons was increased in the absence of 5-HT2B receptors and decreased in their presence through regulation of SK channels, thus demonstrating functional output of this interaction in controlling 5-HT neuron firing activity.",

    "abstract": "When we look at an object, we simultaneously see how glossy or matte it is, how light or dark, and what color. Yet, at each point on the objects surface, both diffuse and specular reflections are mixed in different proportions, resulting in substantial spatial chromatic and luminance variations. To further complicate matters, this pattern changes radically when the object is viewed under different lighting conditions. The purpose of this study was to simultaneously measure our ability to judge color and gloss using an image set capturing diverse object and illuminant properties. Participants adjusted the hue, lightness, chroma, and specular reflectance of a reference object so that it appeared to be made of the same material as a test object. Critically, the two objects were presented under different lighting environments. We found that hue matches were highly accurate, except for under a chromatically atypical illuminant. Chroma and lightness constancy were generally poor, but these failures correlated well with simple image statistics. Gloss constancy was particularly poor, and these failures were only partially explained by reflection contrast. Importantly, across all measures, participants were highly consistent with one another in their deviations from constancy. Although color and gloss constancy hold well in simple conditions, the variety of lighting and shape in the real world presents significant challenges to our visual systems ability to judge intrinsic material properties.",

    "abstract": "SARM1 is a central regulator of programmed axon death and is required to initiate axon self-destruction after traumatic and toxic insults to the nervous system. Abnormal activation of this axon degeneration pathway is increasingly recognized as a contributor to human neurological disease and SARM1 knockdown or inhibition has become an attractive therapeutic strategy to preserve axon loss in a variety of disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system. Despite this, it remains unknown whether Sarm1/SARM1 is present in myelinating glia and whether it plays a role in myelination in the PNS or CNS. It is important to answer these questions to understand whether future therapies inhibiting SARM1 function may have unintended deleterious impacts on myelination. Here we show that Sarm1 mRNA is present in oligodendrocytes in zebrafish but only detectable at low levels in Schwann cells in both zebrafish and mice. We find SARM1 protein is readily detectable in murine oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo and activation of endogenous SARM1 in oligodendrocytes induces cell death. In contrast, SARM1 protein is not detectable in Schwann cells and satellite glia in the adult murine nervous system. Cultured Schwann cells contain negligible functional SARM1 and are insensitive to specific SARM1 activators. Using zebrafish and mouse Sarm1 mutants, we show that SARM1 is not required for initiation of myelination nor myelin sheath maintenance by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Thus, strategies to inhibit SARM1 function in the nervous system to treat neurological disease are unlikely to perturb myelination in humans.\n\nMain PointsO_LISARM1 protein is detectable in oligodendrocytes but not in Schwann cells\nC_LIO_LIOligodendrocytes but not Schwann cells die in response to endogenous SARM1 activation\nC_LIO_LICNS nor PNS myelination, in zebrafish and mice, is hindered by loss of sarm1/Sarm1\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genetic association studies have demonstrated the critical involvement of the microglial immune response in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Phospholipase C-gamma-2 (PLCG2) is selectively expressed by microglia and acts in many immune receptor signaling pathways. In AD, PLCG2 is induced uniquely in plaque-associated microglia. A genetic variant of PLCG2, PLCG2P522R, is a mild hypermorph that attenuates AD risk. We report the identification of a PLCG2 variant, PLCG2M28L, associated with loss-of-function and confers increased AD risk. PLCG2P522R attenuates disease in an amyloidogenic murine AD model, whereas PLCG2M28L exacerbates the plaque burden associated with altered phagocytosis and A{beta} clearance. The variants bidirectionally modulate disease pathology by inducing distinct transcriptional programs that identify microglial subpopulations associated with protective or detrimental phenotypes. In summary, these findings identify PLCG2M28L as a new AD risk variant and demonstrate that PLCG2 variants can differentially orchestrate microglial responses in AD pathogenesis that can be therapeutically targeted.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519685v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19f0aa6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@74191eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3a3forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db2a44_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIA genetic variant of PLCG2, M28L, is associated with an increased risk for Alzheimers disease (AD)\nC_LIO_LIIn an amyloidogenic AD mouse model, PLCG2M28L exacerbates disease pathogenesis\nC_LIO_LIConversely, PLCG2P522R, a protective PLCG2 variant, attenuates AD pathogenesis\nC_LIO_LIThe PLCG2 variants uniquely alter the microglial transcriptome and phenotypes\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a vital role in host homeostasis and understanding of its biology is essential for a better comprehension of the etiology of disorders such as foetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Here we assessed the effectiveness of targeted and untargeted (metagenomic) nanopore sequencing approaches to profile the gut microbiota of infant mice exposed to ethanol in utero. DNA extracts from the gut content of 12 infant mice exposed to ethanol in utero were analysed using one untargeted and two targeted (full-length 16S rRNA gene and the 16S-ITS-23S region of the ribosomal RNA operon) nanopore sequencing approaches. The targeting of the full-length 16S rRNA gene provided the most comprehensive analysis of the mouse gut microbiota. The differences in diversity between approaches were accounted by the sequencing target (p-value < 0.001). Faecalibaculum rodentium and Duncaniella sp. were the two most prevalent taxa detected using targeted sequencing approaches, while bacterial taxa were more evenly represented when using the metagenomic approach. Full-length 16S rRNA gene nanopore sequencing provides the most discriminatory microbiota compositional analysis of mice faecal samples. However, using nanopore sequencing approaches targeting the metagenome or different taxonomically-informative DNA region appears to introduce significant target-related biases.\n\nImportanceCurrent nanopore approaches have not been standardized which may confound the biological interpretations of hight-throughput sequencing datasets. Additionally, nanopore sequencing still present a high error-rate compared to other more mature sequencing technologies, such as Illumina sequencing. These technological handicaps create the need to study and optimize nanopore sequencing approaches to answer biological questions, such as interrogations of the microbial composition and abundance of clinical and environmental samples. In this work, three nanopore sequencing approaches were designed and attempted to optimize fungal and bacterial profiling sequencing methodologies. Two targeted methods based on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, and 16S-ITS-23S rrn operon region, and one untargeted shotgun/metagenomic approach were tested. Despite potential experimental and/or bioinformatical biases were found, the 16S rRNA gene-targeted nanopore sequencing was the most comprehensive approach to study the microbial composition of the infant mice gut microbiotas.",

The nanopore sequencing was implemented using MinION system targeting PCR-amplified amplicons made from the full-length 16S rRNA gene. The Illumina sequencing was performed using Miseq system targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Ethanol exposure did not affect the microbial profiles.

    "abstract": "Liver-generated plasma Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-containing lipoproteins (LPs) (ApoE-LPs) play central roles in lipid transport and metabolism. Perturbations of ApoE can result in several metabolic disorders and ApoE genotypes have been associated with multiple diseases. ApoE is synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the Golgi apparatus for LP assembly; however, ApoE-LPs transport from there to the plasma membrane is largely unknown. Here, we established an integrative imaging approach based on a fully functional fluorescently tagged ApoE. We found that ApoE-LPs accumulate in CD63-positive endosomes of hepatocytes. In addition, we observed the co-egress of ApoE-LPs and extracellular vesicles (EVs) along the late endosomal trafficking route. Moreover, complexes of ApoE-LPs and CD63-positive EVs were found to be transmitted from cell to cell. Given the important role of ApoE in viral infections, we studied the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and found that the viral replicase protein NS5A is enriched in ApoE-containing intraluminal vesicles. Interaction between NS5A and ApoE is required for the efficient release of EVs containing viral RNA. These vesicles are transported along the endosomal ApoE egress pathway. Taken together, our data argue for endosomal egress and transmission of hepatic ApoE-LPs, a pathway that is hijacked by HCV. Given the more general role of EV-mediated cell-to-cell communication, these insights provide new starting points for research into the pathophysiology of ApoE-related metabolic and infection-related disorders.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe post-Golgi egress pathway of hepatocyte-derived ApoE-containing lipoproteins (ApoE-LPs) is largely unknown. By using integrative imaging analyses, we show that ApoE-LPs are enriched in CD63-positive endosomes suggesting that these endosomes might be a central hub for the storage of ApoE-LPs from which they are released into the circulation. In addition, we provide evidence for the co-egress of ApoE-LPs with extracellular vesicles (EVs) along the late endosomal route and their transfer from cell to cell. This pathway is hijacked by the hepatitis C virus that induces the production of ApoE-associated EVs containing viral RNA. Given the important role of ApoE in multiple metabolic, degenerative and infectious diseases, and the role of EVs in cell-to-cell communication, these results provide important information how perturbations of ApoE might contribute to various pathophysiologies.",

    "abstract": "Candidiasis is the most common fungal infection in hospitalized patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome resulting to morbidity and mortality. This study aimed at characterizing, incidence, susceptibility, resistance genes, antibiofilm activity, and virulence traits of Candida species isolated from HIV-Infected patients. One hundred and eighty-one samples were collected and cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, biochemical tests and confirmed using automated Vitek-2 (R) Compact bioMerieux followed by susceptibility tests. were done by use of various conventional antifungals against the isolates using standard procedures. Virulence factors, biofilm formations and resistance genes of Candida strains were determined. Out of the 181 samples, 46 were identified as Candida spp., 20 C. albicans (43.5%), 6 C. tropicalis (13.0%), 8 C. krusei (17.4%), 4 C. glabrata (8.7%), 3 C. famata (6.5%), 3 C. parapsilosis (6.5%), and 2 C. guilliermondii (4.3%). All the Candida albicans isolated were both Gram positive and Germ test tube test positive. Eighteen (90%) of the isolates were susceptible to Clotrimazole at a concentration of 5 g/mL - 10g/mL followed by 17 (85%) isolates to Panosoconazole at a concentration of 0.002 g/mL - 5g/mL. Eight (40.0 %) of the Candida albicans isolates possessed the gene (cdr1) that was observed at 286 bp. Virulence enzymes was determined in which 100% produced Haemolysin, followed by proteinase (75.0%), phospholipase (50%), coagulase at (50%) and lastly capsulase (25.0%). Fluconazole and Clotrimazole did not inhibit growth of C. albicans at high concentrations but from our study, it was deduced that they inhibit biofilm formation at lower concentrations. C. albicans isolates were resistant to multiple antifungal including those commonly used in the management on HIV/AIDs patient. This attributed to resistant genes and produced various virulence factors that were found to be present in the isolates. Therefore, there is a need to carry out regular surveillance on antifungal drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "The obligate intracellular protozoan parasite Leishmania binds several host cell receptors to trigger its uptake by phagocytic cells, ultimately resulting in visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis. After Leishmania engages receptors on macrophages and other phagocytes, a series of signaling pathways in the host cell are activated during its internalization, which are critical for establishment and persistence of Leishmania infection. Thus, preventing Leishmania internalization by phagocytes could be a novel therapeutic strategy for leishmaniasis. However, the host cellular machinery that mediates promastigote and amastigote uptake is not well understood. Here, using small-molecule inhibitors of Mitogen-activated protein kinases/Extracellular signal regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK), we demonstrate that ERK1/2 mediates Leishmania amazonensis uptake and (to a lesser extent) phagocytosis of beads by macrophages. We find that inhibition of MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 leads to inefficient amastigote uptake by macrophages. Moreover, using inhibitors and primary macrophages lacking spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) or Abl family kinases, we show that SYK and Abl family kinases mediate Raf, MEK, and ERK1/2 activity and are necessary for efficient uptake. Finally, we demonstrate that trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor used clinically to treat certain cancers, significantly reduces disease severity and parasite burden in Leishmania-infected mice, even if it is started significantly after lesions develop. Our results show that maximal Leishmania infection requires MAPK/ERK and highlight the potential for MAPK/ERK-mediated signaling pathways to be novel therapeutic targets for leishmaniasis.\n\nAuthor (lay) summaryLeishmania is a single-celled parasite that causes skin ulcers or a disseminated disease in humans. Our goal is to identify new drugs to treat Leishmania infection. Leishmania must live inside human immune cells to cause disease. If Leishmania is not able to enter human immune cells, it dies. Our studies demonstrate how Leishmania infection stimulates a set of proteins called MAP kinases, which pass signals from one protein to the next within mammalian immune cells. The resulting signals allow Leishmania to enter into these immune cells and survive within its host. Importantly, a drug that prevents these signals from MAP kinases, called trametinib, decreases the development of skin ulcers when it is given to mice that are infected with Leishmania. Our findings suggest that Leishmania could be treated with drugs that act on kinases found in humans rather than the parasites themselves.\n\nOne sentence summaryAn Abl2-SYK-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway facilitates Leishmania uptake by phagocytic cells and promotes disease severity in Leishmania-infected mice.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum accounts for the majority of over 600000 malaria-associated deaths annually. Parasites resistant to nearly all antimalarials have emerged and the need for drugs with alternative modes of action is thus undoubted. The FK506-binding protein PfFKBP35 has gained attention as a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506 (tacrolimus). Whilst there is considerable interest in targeting PfFKBP35 with small molecules, a genetic validation of this factor as a drug target is missing and its function in parasite biology remains elusive. Here, we show that limiting PfFKBP35 levels are lethal to P. falciparum and result in a delayed death-like phenotype that is characterized by defective ribosome homeostasis and stalled protein synthesis. Our data furthermore suggest that FK506, unlike the action of this drug in model organisms, exerts its anti-proliferative activity in a PfFKBP35-independent manner and, using cellular thermal shift assays, we identify putative FK506-targets beyond PfFKBP35. In addition to revealing first insights into the function of PfFKBP35, our results show that FKBP-binding drugs can adopt non-canonical modes of action - with major implications for the development of FK506-derived molecules active against Plasmodium parasites and other eukaryotic pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The proline-rich antimicrobial peptide (PrAMP) drosocin is produced by Drosophila species to combat bacterial infection. Unlike many PrAMPs, drosocin is O-glycosylated at threonine 11, a post-translation modification that enhances its antimicrobial activity. Here we demonstrate that the O-glycosylation influences not only cellular uptake of the peptide, but also interacts with its intracellular target, the ribosome. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of glycosylated drosocin on the ribosome at 2.1-2.8 [A] resolution reveal that the peptide interferes with translation termination by binding within the polypeptide exit tunnel and trapping RF1 on the ribosome, reminiscent of that reported for the PrAMP apidaecin. The glycosylation of drosocin enables multiple interactions with U2609 of the 23S rRNA, leading to conformational changes that break the canonical base-pair with A752. Collectively, our study provides novel molecular insights into the interaction of O-glycosylated drosocin with the ribosome, which provides a structural basis for future development of this class of antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria naturally colonize grapevine wood, and some populations interact synergistically with fungal pathogens to promote wood degradation. In this study, we characterized a bacterial strain, designated S150T, isolated from the wood of grapevine cultivar Sauvignon Blanc. The strain was previously known as promoting wood degradation caused by the causal agent of white-rot, Fomitiporia mediterranea. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the strain S150T belonged to the genus Paenibacillus. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, S150T shared low sequence similarity values (between 96.5 and 97.5%) with closed recognized members of the genus (P. jilunlii Be17, P. tepidiphilus SYSU G01001, P. tengchongensis SYSU-G-01003, P. sonchi X19-5, P. helianthi P26E). The cell wall peptidoglycan of S150 contains meso-diaminopimelate. MK6 and MK7 are the two respiratory quinones. The main cellular fatty acids are iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0. The polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three amino phospholipids, two phospholipids and three polar lipids. The whole-genome is 7.45 Mb, with a G+C content of 52.54%. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) value between S150T and the closely related Paenibacillus member (P. sonchi X19-5) was 85.06%. Biochemical and physiological analyses revealed that strain S150T has different characteristics from reference strains Paenibacillus spp.. Phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analyses show strain S150T is a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus xylinteritus is proposed.",

    "abstract": "During cell migration, front-rear polarity is spatiotemporally regulated; however, the underlying design of regulatory interactions vary. In rod-shaped Myxococcus xanthus cells, a spatial toggle switch dynamically regulates front-rear polarity. The polarity module establishes front-rear polarity by guaranteeing front pole-localization of the small GTPase MglA. Conversely, the Frz chemosensory system, by acting on the polarity module, causes polarity inversions. MglA localization depends on the RomR/RomX GEF and MglB/RomY GAP complexes that localize asymmetrically to the poles by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that RomR and the MglB and MglC roadblock domain proteins generate a positive feedback by forming a RomR/MglC/MglB complex, thereby establishing the rear pole with high GAP activity that is non-permissive to MglA. MglA at the front engages in negative feedback that inhibits the RomR/MglC/MglB positive feedback allosterically, thus ensuring low GAP activity at this pole. These findings unravel the design principles of a system for switchable front-rear polarity.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of serious and even fatal acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants and in the elderly. Potent RSV neutralization has been achieved by antibodies that selectively bind the prefusion form of the viral fusion (F) protein. We hypothesised that similar potent neutralization could be achieved using F protein targeting aptamers. Aptamers have yet to reach their translational potential for therapeutics or diagnostics due to their short half-life and limited range of target-aptamer interactions; these shortcomings can, however, be ameliorated by application of amino acid-like side chain holding nucleotides. In this study, a stabilized version of the prefusion RSV F protein was targeted by aptamer selection using an oligonucleotide library holding a tryptophan-like side chain. This process resulted in aptamers that bound the F protein with high affinity and differentiated between pre- and postfusion conformation. Identified aptamers inhibited viral infection of lung epithelial cells. Moreover, introduction of modified nucleotides extended aptamer half-lives. Our results suggest that targeting aptamers to the surface of viruses could yield effective drug candidates, which could keep up with the pace of the continuously evolving pathogens.",

Here, we show that the ribosome-associated complex (RAC)/Ssb chaperone system is required to maintain proteostasis and cell viability under TORC1 inhibition, in yeast. In the absence of the Hsp40 cochaperone Zuo1, translation does not decrease in response to loss of TORC1 activity. The functional interaction between Zuo1 and its Hsp70 partner, Ssb, is required for proper translational control and proteostasis maintenance upon TORC1 inhibition. Further, we have found that the rapid degradation of eIF4G following TORC1 inhibition is prevented in zuo1{Delta} cells, contributing to decreased survival in these conditions. Our findings suggest a new role for RAC/Ssb in regulating translation in response to changes in TORC1 signalling.",

Here, we rationalize a mechanism of inhibition against the periplasmic adaptor protein, AcrA, using a combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, cellular efflux assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. We define the structural dynamics of AcrA and find that an inhibitor can inflict long-range stabilisation across all four of its domains, whereas an interacting efflux substrate has minimal effect. Our results support a model where an inhibitor forms a molecular wedge within a cleft between the lipoyl and {beta} domains of AcrA, diminishing its conformational transmission of drug-evoked signals from AcrB to TolC.

    "abstract": "Evidence implicating p38{gamma} and p38{delta} (p38{gamma}/p38{delta}) in inflammation are mainly based on experiments using p38{gamma}/p38{delta} deficient (p38{gamma}/{delta}-/-) mice, which show low levels of TPL2, the kinase upstream of MKK1-ERK1/2 in myeloid cells. This could obscure p38{gamma}/p38{delta} roles, since TPL2 is essential for regulating inflammation. Here we generated a p38{gamma}D171A/D171A/p38{delta}-/- (p38{gamma}/{delta}KIKO) mouse, expressing kinase-inactive p38{gamma} and lacking p38{delta}. This mouse exhibited normal TPL2 levels, making it an excellent tool to elucidate specific p38{gamma}/p38{delta} functions. p38{gamma}/{delta}KIKO mice showed a reduced inflammatory response and less susceptibility to LPS-induced septic shock and Candida albicans infection than wild-type mice. Gene expression analyses in LPS-activated WT and p38{gamma}/{delta}KIKO macrophages revealed that p38{gamma}/p38{delta} regulated numerous genes implicated in innate immune response. Additionally, phospho-proteomic analyses and in vitro kinase assays showed that the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2D (MEF2D) was phosphorylated at Ser444 via p38{gamma}/p38{delta}. Mutation of MEF2D Ser444 to the non-phosphorylatable residue Ala increased its transcriptional activity and the expression of iNOS and IL-1{beta} mRNA. These results suggest that p38{gamma}/p38{delta} govern innate immune responses by regulating MEF2D phosphorylation and transcriptional activity.",

    "abstract": "Compared to full-term (FT) born peers, children who were born very preterm (VPT; <32 weeks gestation) are likely to display more cognitive and behavioural difficulties, including inattention, anxiety and socio-communication problems. In the published literature, such difficulties tend to be studied independently, thus failing to account for how different aspects of child development interact. The current study aimed to investigate childrens cognitive and behavioural outcomes as interconnected, dynamically related facets of development that influence one another. Participants were 93 VPT and 55 FT children (median age 8.79 years). IQ was evaluated with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - 4th edition (WISC-IV), autism spectrum condition (ASC) traits with the Social Responsiveness Scale - 2nd edition (SRS-2), behavioural and emotional problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), temperament with the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ) and executive function with the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF-2). Outcome measures were studied in VPT and FT children using Network Analysis, a method that graphically represents partial correlations between variables and yields information on each variables propensity to form a bridge between other variables. Results showed that VPT and FT children exhibited marked topological differences. Bridges (i.e., the variables most connected to others) in the VPT group network were: SDQ Conduct Problems scale and BRIEF-2 Organisation of Materials scale. In the FT group network, the most important bridges were: the BRIEF-2 Initiate, SDQ Emotional Problems and SDQ Prosocial Behaviours scales. These findings highlight the importance of targeting different aspects of development to support VPT and FT children in person-based interventions.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe application of machine learning approaches in phylogenetics has been impeded by the vast model space associated with inference. Supervised machine learning approaches require data from across this space to train models. Because of this, previous approaches have typically been limited to inferring relationships among unrooted quartets of taxa, where there are only three possible topologies. Here, we explore the potential of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to address this limitation. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator: at each step, the generator aims to create data that is similar to real data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish generated and real data. By using an evolutionary model as the generator, we use GANs to make evolutionary inferences. Since a new model can be considered at each iteration, heuristic searches of complex model spaces are possible. Thus, GANs offer a potential solution to the challenges of applying machine learning in phylogenetics.\n\nResultsWe developed phyloGAN, a GAN that infers phylogenetic relationships among species. phy-loGAN takes as input a concatenated alignment, or a set of gene alignments, and infers a phylogenetic tree either considering or ignoring gene tree heterogeneity. We explored the performance of phyloGAN for up to fifteen taxa in the concatenation case and six taxa when considering gene tree heterogeneity. Error rates are relatively low in these simple cases. However, run times are slow and performance metrics suggest issues during training. Future work should explore novel architectures that may result in more stable and efficient GANs for phylogenetics.\n\nAvailabilityphyloGAN is available on github: https://github.com/meganlsmith/phyloGAN/.\n\nContactmls16@indiana.edu",

    "abstract": "Cell type identity is encoded by gene regulatory networks (GRN), in which transcription factors (TFs) bind to enhancers to regulate target gene expression. In the mammalian liver, lineage TFs have been characterized for the main cell types, including hepatocytes. Hepatocytes cover a relatively broad cellular state space, as they differ significantly in their metabolic state, and function, depending on their position with respect to the central or portal vein in a liver lobule. It is unclear whether this spatially defined cellular state space, called zonation, is also governed by a well-defined gene regulatory code. To address this challenge, we have mapped enhancer-GRNs across liver cell types at high resolution, using a combination of single cell multiomics, spatial omics, GRN inference, and deep learning. We found that cell state changes in transcription and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic stellate cells depend on zonation. Enhancer-GRN mapping suggests that zonation states in hepatocytes are driven by the repressors Tcf7l1 and Tbx3, that modulate the core hepatocyte GRN, controlled by Hnf4a, Cebpa, Hnf1a, Onecut1 and Foxa1, among others. To investigate how these TFs cooperate with cell type TFs, we performed an in vivo massively parallel reporter assay on 12,000 hepatocyte enhancers and used these data to train a hierarchical deep learning model (called DeepLiver) that exploits both enhancer accessibility and activity. DeepLiver confirms Cebpa, Onecut, Foxa1, Hnf1a and Hnf4a as drivers of enhancer specificity in hepatocytes; Tcf7l1/2 and Tbx3 as regulators of the zonation state; and Hnf4a, Hnf1a, AP-1 and Ets as activators. Finally, taking advantage of in silico mutagenesis predictions from DeepLiver and enhancer assays, we confirmed that the destruction of Tcf7l1/2 or Tbx3 motifs in zonated enhancers abrogates their zonation bias. Our study provides a multi-modal understanding of the regulatory code underlying hepatocyte identity and their zonation state, that can be exploited to engineer enhancers with specific activity levels and zonation patterns.",
