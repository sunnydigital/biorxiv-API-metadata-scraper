    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas programmable nuclease systems have become ubiquitous in the field of gene editing. With progressing development, applications in in vivo therapeutic gene editing are increasingly within reach, yet limited by possible adverse side effects from unwanted edits. Recent years have thus seen continuous development of off-target prediction algorithms trained on in vitro cleavage assay data gained from immortalised cell lines. It has been shown that in contrast to experimental epigenetic features, computed physically informed features are so far underutilised despite bearing considerably larger correlation with cleavage activity. Here, we implement state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and feature encodings for off-target prediction with emphasis on physically informed features that capture the biological environment of the cleavage site, hence terming our approach piCRISPR. Features were gained from the large, diverse crisprSQL off-target cleavage dataset. We find that our best-performing models highlight the importance of sequence context and chromatin accessibility for cleavage prediction and compare favourably with literature standard prediction performance. We further show that our novel, environmentally sensitive features are crucial to accurate prediction on sequence-identical locus pairs, making them highly relevant for clinical guide design.

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of efficiently escaping neutralizing antibodies emphasizes the need for prophylactic strategies to complement vaccination in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Nasal epithelium is rich in the ACE2 receptor and important for SARS-CoV-2 transmission by supporting early viral replication before seeding to the lung1. Intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies or antibody fragments has shown encouraging potential as a protective measure in animal models2-5. However, there remains a dire need for SARS-CoV-2 blocking agents that are less vulnerable to mutational variation in the neutralization epitopes of the viral spike glycoprotein and more economical to produce in large scale. Here we describe TriSb92, a highly manufacturable and extremely stable trimeric human SH3 domain-derived antibody mimetic targeted against a conserved region in the receptor-binding domain of spike. TriSb92 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, including Omicron BA.5 as well as the latest and most immunoevasive variants like BF.7, XBB, and BQ.1.1. Intranasal administration of a modest dose of TriSb92 (5 or 50 micrograms) as early as eight hours before a challenge with SARS-CoV-2 efficiently protected mice from infection, and was still effective even when given 4 h after the viral challenge. The target epitope of TriSb92 was defined by cryo-EM, which revealed triggering of a conformational shift in the spike trimer rather than competition for ACE2 binding as the molecular basis of its strong inhibitory action. The high potency and robust biochemical properties of TriSb92 together with the remarkable resistance of its inhibitory action against viral sequence evolution suggest that TriSb92 could be useful as a nasal spray for protecting susceptible individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (-syn), a major component of Lewy bodies found in Parkinsons disease (PD) patients, has been found exported outside of cells and may mediate its toxicity via cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we reconstituted soluble, monomeric -syn secretion by the expression of DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 5 (DNAJC5) in HEK293T cells. DNAJC5 undergoes palmitoylation and anchors on the membrane. Palmitoylation is essential for DNAJC5-induced -syn secretion, and the secretion is not limited by substrate size or unfolding. Cytosolic -syn is actively translocated and sequestered in an endosomal membrane compartment in a DNAJC5-dependent manner. Reduction of -syn secretion caused by a palmitoylation-deficient mutation in DNAJC5 can be reversed by a membrane-targeting peptide fusion-induced oligomerization of DNAJC5. The secretion of endogenous -syn mediated by DNAJC5 is also found in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, differentiated into neurons in the presence of retinoic acid, and in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain dopamine neurons. We propose that DNAJC5 forms a palmitoylated oligomer to accommodate and export -syn.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how motor plans are transformed into appropriate patterns of muscle activity is a central question in motor control. While muscle activity during the delay period has not been reported using conventional EMG approaches, we isolated motor unit activity using a high-density surface EMG signal from the anterior deltoid muscle to test whether heterogeneity in motor units could reveal early preparatory activity. Consistent with our previous work (Rungta et al., 2021), we observed early selective recruitment of small-amplitude size motor units during the delay period for hand movements like early recruitment of small-amplitude motor units in neck muscles of non-human primates performing delayed saccade tasks. This early activity was spatially specific and increased with time and resembled an accumulation to threshold model that correlated with movement onset time. Such early recruitment of ramping motor units was also observed at the single trial level as well. In contrast, no such recruitment of large amplitude size motor units, called non-rampers, was observed during the delay period. Instead, non-rampers became spatially specific and predicted movement onset time after the delay period. Interestingly, spatially specific delay period activity was only observed for hand movements but was absent for isometric force-driven cursor movements. Nonetheless, muscle activity was correlated with the time it took to initiate movements in both task conditions for non-rampers. Overall, our results reveal a novel heterogeneity in the EMG activity which allows the expression of early motor preparation via small amplitude size motor units which are differentially activated during initiation of movements.\n\nSignificance statementWe studied the spatial and temporal aspects of response preparation in the anterior deltoid muscle using high-density surface EMG. Our results show that early spatially specific ramping activity that predicted reaction times could be accessed from muscle activity but was absent during isometric force-driven cursor movements. Such ramping activity could be quantified using an accumulator framework across trials, as well as within single trials but was not observed in isometric reach tasks involving cursor movements.",

    "abstract": "Paramecium is a large unicellular organism that swims in fresh water using cilia. When stimulated by various means (mechanically, chemically, optically, thermally), it often swims backward then turns and swims forward again in a new direction: this is called the avoiding reaction. This reaction is triggered by a calcium-based action potential. For this reason, several authors have called Paramecium the \"swimming neuron\". Here we present an empirically constrained model of its action potential based on electrophysiology experiments on live immobilized paramecia, together with simultaneous measurement of ciliary beating using particle image velocimetry. Using these measurements and additional behavioral measurements of free swimming, we extend the electrophysiological model by coupling calcium concentration to kinematic parameters, turning it into a swimming model. In this way, we obtain a model of autonomously behaving Paramecium. Finally, we demonstrate how the modeled organism interacts with an environment, can follow gradients and display collective behavior. This work provides a modeling basis for investigating the physiological basis of autonomous behavior of Paramecium in ecological environments.\n\nAuthor SummaryBehavior depends on a complex interaction between a variety of physiological processes, the body and the environment. We propose to examine this complex interaction in an organism consisting of a single excitable and motile cell, Paramecium. The behavior of Paramecium is based on trial and error: when it encounters an undesirable situation, it backs up and changes direction. This avoiding reaction is triggered by an action potential. Here we developed an empirically constrained biophysical model of Parameciums action potential, which we then coupled to its kinematics. We then demonstrate the potential of this model in investigating various types of autonomous behavior, such as obstacle avoidance, gradient-following and collective behavior.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic studies have greatly improved organ-specific insights into macrophage polarization states are essential for the initiation and resolution of inflammation in all tissues; however, such insights are yet to translate into therapies that can predictably alter macrophage fate. Using machine learning algorithms on human macrophages, here we reveal the continuum of polarization states that is shared across diverse contexts. A path, comprised of 338 genes accurately identified both physiologic and pathologic spectra of \"reactivity\" and \"tolerance\", and remained relevant across tissues, organs, species and immune cells (> 12,500 diverse datasets). This 338-gene signature identified macrophage polarization states at single-cell resolution, in physiology and across diverse human diseases, and in murine pre-clinical disease models. The signature consistently outperformed conventional signatures in the degree of transcriptome-proteome overlap, and in detecting disease states; it also prognosticated outcomes across diverse acute and chronic diseases, e.g., sepsis, liver fibrosis, aging and cancers. Crowd-sourced genetic and pharmacologic studies confirmed that model-rationalized interventions trigger predictable macrophage fates. These findings provide a formal and universally relevant definition of macrophage states and a predictive framework (http://hegemon.ucsd.edu/SMaRT) for the scientific community to develop macrophage-targeted precision diagnostics and therapeutics.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySignatures of macrophage reactivity and tolerance (SMaRT) predict disease outcomes",

Macrophage infiltration into radiation-damaged sites has been shown to promote breast cancer recurrence in pre-clinical models. However, the mechanisms that drive recurrence are unknown. Here, we developed a novel spheroid model to evaluate macrophage-mediated tumor cell recruitment. We first characterized infiltrating macrophage phenotypes into irradiated mammary tissue to inform our model. We then established spheroids consisting of fibroblasts isolated from mouse mammary glands. We observed that tumor cell motility toward irradiated spheroids was enhanced in the presence of a 2:1 ratio of pro-healing:pro-inflammatory macrophages. We also measured a significant increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion after irradiation both in vivo and in our model. This secretion increased tumor cell invasiveness, and invasion was mitigated by neutralizing IL-6. Taken together, our work suggests that interactions between infiltrating macrophages and damaged stromal cells facilitates breast cancer recurrence through IL-6 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional gene regulation is accomplished by the interplay of the transcriptome with RNA-binding proteins, which occurs in a dynamic manner in response to altered cellular conditions. Recording the combined occupancy of all proteins binding to the transcriptome offers the opportunity to interrogate if a particular treatment leads to any interaction changes, pointing to sites in RNA that undergo post-transcriptional regulation. Here, we establish a method to monitor protein occupancy in a transcriptome-wide fashion by RNA sequencing. To this end, peptide-enhanced pull-down for RNA sequencing (or PEPseq) uses metabolic RNA labelling with 4-thiouridine (4SU) for light-induced protein-RNA crosslinking, and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry to isolate protein-crosslinked RNA fragments across all long RNA biotypes. We use PEPseq to investigate changes in protein occupancy during the onset of arsenite-induced translational stress in human cells and reveal evidence for ribosome stalling and depletion from stress granules for a distinct set of mRNAs, many coding for ribosomal proteins. We use quantitative proteomics to demonstrate that translation of these mRNAs remains repressed during the initial hours of recovery after arsenite stress. Thus, we present PEPseq as a discovery platform for the unbiased investigation of post-transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "It was proposed from cellular studies that S. pombe tropomyosin Cdc8 (Tpm) segregates into two populations due to the presence or absence of an amino-terminal acetylation that specifies which formin-mediated F-actin networks it binds, but with no supporting biochemistry. To address this mechanism in vitro, we developed methods for S. pombe actin expression in Sf9 cells. We then employed 3-color TIRF microscopy using all recombinant S. pombe proteins to probe in vitro multicomponent mechanisms involving actin, acetylated and unacetylated Tpm, formins, and myosins. Acetyl-Tpm exhibits tight binding to actin in contrast to weaker binding by unacetylated Tpm. In disagreement with the differential recruitment model, Tpm showed no preferential binding to filaments assembled by the FH1-FH2-domains of two S. pombe formins, nor did Tpm binding have any bias towards the growing formin-bound actin filament barbed end. Although our in vitro findings do not support a direct formin-tropomyosin interaction, it is possible that formins bias differential tropomyosin isoform recruitment through undiscovered mechanisms. Importantly, despite a 12% sequence divergence between skeletal and S. pombe actin, S. pombe myosins Myo2 and Myo51 exhibited similar motile behavior with these two actins, validating key prior findings with these myosins that used skeletal actin.",

    "abstract": "Maturation of functional liquid-like biomolecular condensates into solid-like aggregates has been linked to the onset of several neurodegenerative disorders. Low-complexity aromatic-rich kinked segments (LARKS) contained in numerous RNA-binding proteins can promote aggregation by forming inter-protein {beta}-sheet fibrils that accumulate over time and ultimately drive the liquid-to-solid transition of the condensates. Here, we combine atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with sequence-dependent coarse-grained models of various resolutions to investigate the role of LARKS abundance and position within the amino acid sequence in the maturation of condensates. Remarkably, proteins with tail-located LARKS display much higher viscosity over time than those in which the LARKS are placed towards the center. Yet, at very long timescales, proteins with a single LARKS--independently of its location--can still relax and behave as high viscous liquids. However, phase-separated condensates of proteins containing two or more LARKS become kinetically trapped due to the formation of percolated {beta}-sheet networks that display gel-like behaviour. Furthermore, as a work case example, we demonstrate how shifting the location of the LARKS-containing low-complexity domain of FUS protein towards its center effectively precludes the accumulation of {beta}-sheet fibrils in FUS-RNA condensates, maintaining functional liquid-like behaviour without ageing.",

    "abstract": "Although cooperative hunting (CH) is widespread among animals, its benefits are unclear. When rare, CH may allow predators to escape competition and access \"big prey\" (BP). However, a lone CH predator cannot such catch food. Cultural transmission may allow CH to spread fast enough that cooperators can find hunting partners, but competition for BP may increase. We construct a one-predator, two-prey model in which the predators either learn to hunt \"small prey\" (SP) alone, or learn to hunt BP cooperatively. The predators first learn vertically and then choose partners from which they learn horizontally with probability H. CH predators only catch the BP if their partner is cooperative. We find that without horizontal learning, CH cannot evolve when initially rare. Together, a high probability of horizontal learning and competition for the SP allow CH to evolve. However, CH can only fix in the predator population if the BP is very abundant. Furthermore, a mutant that increases horizontal learning can invade whenever CH is present but not fixed, because horizontal learning allows predators to match their strategies, avoiding the situation in which a cooperator cannot find a partner. While competition for prey is important for determining the degree of CH that evolves, it is not enough for CH to emerge and spread; horizontal cultural transmission is essential. Future models may explore factors that control how horizontal transmission influences cooperative predation, and vice versa. Lessons from our model may be useful in conservation efforts and wildlife reintroduction programs.",

Strikingly, presence of DptA- or DptB-like genes across Diptera correlates with the presence of Providencia and Acetobacter in their environment.

    "abstract": "Previously we showed that mice lacking the protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1 BKO) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) have induction of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which promotes fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) secretion as a batokine. FGF21 increases metabolic rates at baseline conditions but is dispensable for the resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO) reported in OPA1 BKO mice [1]. To determine alternative mediators of this phenotype, we performed transcriptome analysis, which revealed increased levels of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in BAT. To determine if ATF4 induction was mediated by the protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and to evaluate the contribution of GDF15 to the resistance to DIO, we selectively deleted PERK or GDF15 in OPA1 BKO mice. Mice lacking both OPA1 and PERK in BAT had preserved induction of ATF4. Importantly, simultaneous deletion of OPA1 and GDF15 partially reversed the resistance to diet-induced obesity and abrogated the improvements in glucose tolerance. Furthermore, GDF15 mediated cold-induced thermogenesis, likely via sympathetic activation of iWAT. Taken together, our data indicate that PERK is dispensable for ATF4 induction, but GDF15 contributes to the resistance to DIO, and is required for glucose homeostasis and thermoregulation in OPA1 BKO mice.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal dense-core vesicles (DCVs) contain neuropeptides and much larger proteins that affect synaptic growth and plasticity. Rather than using full collapse exocytosis that is common in endocrine cells, DCVs at a native intact synapse, the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, release their contents via fusion pores formed by kiss and run exocytosis. Here fluorogen activating protein (FAP) imaging reveals the permeability range of synaptic DCV fusion pores and then shows that this constraint is circumvented by cAMP-induced extra fusions with dilating pores that result in DCV emptying. These Ca2+-independent full fusions require PKA-R2, a PKA phosphorylation site on the fusion clamp protein complexin and the acute presynaptic function of Rugose/Neurobeachin, a PKA-R2 anchor implicated in learning and autism. Therefore, localized Ca2+-independent cAMP signaling opens dilating fusion pores to release large cargo proteins that cannot pass through the narrower fusion pores that normally dominate spontaneous and Ca2+-evoked synaptic protein release. Hence, two independent exocytosis triggers (Ca2+ and cAMP) vary the composition of released proteins at the synapse by differentially adjusting DCV fusion pores.",

Current therapies are only symptomatic, and are not able to stop or delay its progression. In order to search new and more effective therapies, our group carried out a high-throughput screening assay, identifying several candidate compounds able to suppress motor defects in DJ-1{beta} mutant flies (a Drosophila model of familial PD) and to reduce oxidative stress (OS)-induced lethality in DJ-1-deficient SH-SY5Y human cells. One of them was vincamine (VIN), a natural alkaloid obtained from the leaves of Vinca minor. Our results showed that VIN is able to suppress PD-related phenotypes in both Drosophila and human cell PD models. Specifically, VIN reduced OS levels in PD model flies. Besides, VIN diminished OS-induced lethality by decreasing apoptosis, increased mitochondrial viability and reduced OS levels in DJ-1-deficient human cells. In addition, we have demonstrated that VIN is able to exert its beneficial role, at least partially, by the inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Therefore, we propose that these channels might be a promising target in the search for new compounds to treat PD, and that VIN constitutes a potential therapeutic treatment for the disease.",

    "abstract": "How does wiring specificity of neural maps emerge during development? Formation of the adult Drosophila olfactory glomerular map begins with patterning of projection neuron (PN) dendrites at the early pupal stage. To better understand the origin of wiring specificity of this map, we created genetic tools to systematically characterize dendrite patterning across development at PN type-specific resolution. We find that PNs use lineage and birth order combinatorially to build the initial dendritic map. Specifically, birth order directs dendrite targeting in rotating and binary manners for PNs of the anterodorsal and lateral lineages, respectively. Two-photon- and adaptive optical lattice light-sheet microscope-based time-lapse imaging reveals that PN dendrites initiate active targeting with direction-dependent branch stabilization on the timescale of seconds. Moreover, PNs that are used in both the larval and adult olfactory circuits prune their larval-specific dendrites and re-extend new dendrites simultaneously to facilitate timely olfactory map organization. Our work highlights the power and necessity of type-specific neuronal access and time-lapse imaging in identifying wiring mechanisms that underlie complex patterns of functional neural maps.",

    "abstract": "Aims/hypothesisType 1 diabetes is characterised by pancreatic islet inflammation and autoimmune-driven pancreatic beta cell destruction. Type I interferons, such as IFN, are key players in early human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis, as the activation of the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway induces inflammation, a long-lasting MHC class I overexpression, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and beta cell apoptosis (in synergy with IL-1{beta}). As TYK2 inhibition has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of type 1 diabetes, we investigated whether the selective TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib could protect beta cells against the damaging effects of IFN and other proinflammatory cytokines (i.e. IFN{gamma} and IL-1{beta}).\n\nMethodsInflammation, ER stress, and apoptosis were evaluated by real-time PCR, immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and nuclear dyes. The promoter activity was assessed by luciferase assay and insulin secretion and content by ELISA. All experiments were performed in the human EndoC- {beta}H1 cell line.\n\nResultsPre-treatment with deucravacitinib prevented IFN effects, such as STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and protein expression as well as MHC class I hyperexpression, in a dose-dependent manner without affecting beta cell survival and function. Comparison between deucravacitinib and two Janus kinase inhibitors, ruxolitinib and baricitinib, showed that deucravacitinib blocked IFN- but not IFN{gamma}-induced signalling pathway. Pre-treatment with deucravacitinib protected beta cells from the pro-apoptotic and proinflammatory effects of two different combinations of cytokines: IFN + IL-1{beta} and IFN{gamma} + IL-1{beta}. Moreover, this TYK2 inhibitor could partially revert apoptosis and inflammation in cells previously treated with IFN + IL-1{beta} or IFN{gamma} + IL-1{beta}.\n\nConclusions/interpretationOur findings suggest that, by protecting beta cells against the deleterious effects of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting beta cell function and survival, deucravacitinib could be repurposed for the prevention or treatment of early type 1 diabetes.\n\nResearch in contextWhat is already known about this subject?\n\nO_LIIn type 1 diabetes, pancreatic beta cells are killed by the immune system\nC_LIO_LIIn early insulitis, type I interferons are crucial for the dialogue between the immune system and pancreatic beta cells\nC_LIO_LIActivation of the TYK2-STAT pathway by IFN induces inflammation, HLA class I overexpression, ER stress, and beta cell apoptosis.\nC_LI\n\nWhat is the key question?\n\nO_LICould the TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib prevent the deleterious effects of IFN and other cytokines in beta cells?\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the new findings?\n\nO_LIDeucravacitinib prevented IFN effects in a dose-dependent manner without affecting beta cell function and survival\nC_LIO_LIPre-treatment with deucravacitinib protected beta cells against apoptosis and inflammation induced by two different combinations of cytokines: IFN + IL-1{beta} and IFN{gamma} + IL-1{beta}\nC_LIO_LIAddition of deucravacitinib to cells pre-treated with IFN + IL-1{beta} or IFN{gamma} + IL-1{beta} partially reverted apoptosis and inflammation induced by these cytokines\nC_LI\n\nHow might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?\n\nO_LIDue to its protective effect against proinflammatory cytokines in beta cells, our findings suggest that deucravacitinib could be repurposed for the prevention or treatment of type 1 diabetes.\nC_LI",

Understanding how they manage biomass and energy production may illuminate the critical points at which respiration feeds into central carbon metabolism and explain possible routes to its optimization. Here we use two related fission yeasts, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, as a comparative model system. We show that although S. japonicus does not respire oxygen, unlike S. pombe, it is capable of efficient NADH oxidation, amino acid synthesis and ATP generation. We probe possible optimization strategies using stable isotope tracing metabolomics, mass isotopologue distribution analysis, genetics, and physiological experiments. S. japonicus appears to have optimized cytosolic NADH oxidation via glycerol-3-phosphate synthesis. It runs a fully bifurcated TCA  cycle, supporting higher amino acid production. Finally, it uses the pentose phosphate pathway both to support faster biomass generation and as a shunt to optimize glycolytic flux, thus producing more ATP than the respiro-fermenting S. pombe. By comparing two related organisms with vastly different metabolic strategies, our work highlights the versatility and plasticity of central carbon metabolism in eukaryotes, illuminating critical adaptations supporting the preferential use of glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePsychosocial stress is transduced into disease risk through energy-dependent release of hormones that affect target organs, tissues, and cells. The magnitude of the physiological stress responses reflects both systemic levels of these hormones and the sensitivity of target tissues to their effects. Thus, differential expression of receptors across organs likely contributes to stress transduction. Here we provide a quantitative whole-body map of glucocorticoid and adrenergic receptor expression.\n\nMethodsWe systematically examined gene expression levels for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), - and {beta}-adrenergic receptors (AR-1B, AR-2B AR-{beta}2, and AR-{beta}3), across 55 different organs using the Human Protein Atlas dataset. We also leveraged the Human Proteome Map and MitoCarta3.0 data to examine receptor protein levels and, given the energy-dependence of the stress response, the link between stress hormone receptor density and mitochondrial pathways. Finally, we tested the functional interplay between GR activation and AR expression in living human cells.\n\nResultsThe GR was expressed ubiquitously across all investigated organ systems. Immune tissues and cells expressed the highest GR RNA and protein levels. In contrast, AR subtypes showed lower and more localized expression patterns. Co-regulation was found between GR and AR-1B, as well as between AR-1B and AR-2B. In human fibroblasts, activating the GR selectively increased AR-{beta}2 (3.6-fold) and AR-1B (2.2-fold) expression, confirming their interaction. Consistent with the energetic cost of stress responses, GR and AR expression were positively associated with the expression of key mitochondrial pathways.\n\nConclusionOur results provide a cartography of GR and AR expression across the human body. Tissue-specific stress hormone receptor expression patterns could make specific organ systems more responsive to the sustained, energetically expensive, neuroendocrine signaling pathways triggered by chronic psychosocial stress.",

Comprehensive tissue-specific RNAi in Drosophila and mutant analysis in C. elegans revealed signature ciliary defects for 70-80% of novel genes, a percentage similar to that for known genes within the cluster. Further characterization identified different phenotypic classes, including a set of genes related to the cartwheel component Bld10/Cep135 and two highly conserved regulators of cilium biogenesis.

PCP is speculated to function in formation of the murine lung, where branching morphogenesis generates a complex tree of tubular epithelia whose distal tips expand dramatically during sacculation in preparation for gas exchange after birth. Here, using tissue-specific knockouts, we show that the PCP complex is dispensable in the airway epithelium for sacculation. Rather, we find a novel, Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme: loss of Vangl1/2 inhibits mesenchymal thinning and expansion of the saccular epithelium. Further, loss of mesenchymal Wnt5a mimics the sacculation defects observed in Vangl2-mutant lungs, implicating mesenchymal Wnt5a/Vangl signaling as a key regulator of late lung morphogenesis. By mathematically modeling sacculation, we predict that the process of sacculation requires a fluid mesenchymal compartment. Finally, lineage-tracing and cell-shape analyses are consistent with the pulmonary mesenchyme acting as a fluid tissue, and suggest that loss of Vangl1/2 likely impacts the ability of mesenchymal cells to exchange neighbors. Our data thus uncover an explicit function for Vangl and the pulmonary mesenchyme during late lung morphogenesis to actively shape the saccular epithelium.",

Given its wide implication, aberrant morphogenesis is linked to severe developmental defects and in a few instances also associated with tumorigenesis. Employing the model of Drosophila oogenesis, we have examined the role of the evolutionary conserved Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase pathway, a known regulator of cell growth and size in mediating shape transition of cuboidal cells to squamous epithelial fate. Utilizing genetic tools, immunohistochemistry, and live cell imaging, we demonstrate that TOR signaling is active and required for epithelial morphogenesis during Drosophila oogenesis. Further, loss of function analyses indicates that non-canonical TOR signaling functions through PAR-1 to mediate the removal of lateral cell adhesion molecule, Fasciclin 2, to allow proper squamous cell morphogenesis. In addition, we demonstrate the effect of TOR through PAR-1 on cell shape transition is mediated via the modulation of endocytosis. Overall, our data give novel insight into how TOR signaling mediates cell shape transition during epithelial morphogenesis in the metazoans.",

    "abstract": "T-cells play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system by inducing an anti-tumour response, defending against pathogens, and maintaining tolerance against self-antigens, which has sparked interest in the development of T-cell-based vaccines and immunotherapies. Because screening antigens driving the T-cell response is currently low-throughput and laborious, computational methods for predicting CD8+ T-cell epitopes have emerged. However, most immunogenicity algorithms struggle to learn features of peptide immunogenicity from small datasets, suffer from HLA bias and are unable to reliably predict pathology-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes. Therefore, we developed TRAP (T-cell recognition potential of HLA-I presented peptides), a robust deep learning platform for predicting CD8+ T-cell epitopes from MHC-I presented pathogenic and self-peptides. TRAP uses transfer learning, deep learning architecture and MHC binding information to make context-specific predictions of CD8+ T-cell epitopes. TRAP also detects low-confidence predictions for peptides that differ significantly from those in the training datasets to abstain from making incorrect predictions. To estimate the immunogenicity of pathogenic peptides with low-confidence predictions, we further developed a novel metric, RSAT (relative similarity to autoantigens and tumour-associated antigens), as a complementary to  dissimilarity to self from cancer studies. We used TRAP to identify epitopes from glioblastoma patients as well as SARS-CoV-2 peptides, and it outperformed other algorithms in both cancer and pathogenic settings. Thus, this study presents a novel computational platform for accurately predicting CD8+ T-cell epitopes to foster a better understanding of antigen-specific T-cell response and the development of effective clinical therapeutics.\n\nHighlightsO_LIHLA bias and out-of-distribution problem are causes of poor performance of current state-of-the-art algorithms\nC_LIO_LITransfer learning, deep learning architecture, context-specific and HLA-generalised approaches improve CD8+ T-cell epitope prediction\nC_LIO_LITRAP reports degree of correctness to improve reliability of the prediction\nC_LIO_LIA novel metric termed RSAT estimates immunogenicity of pathogenic peptides, as a complementary to  dissimilarity to self from cancer studies\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Epidermal cells of dark-grown plant seedlings reorient their cortical microtubule arrays in response to blue light from a net lateral orientation to a net longitudinal orientation with respect to the long axis of cells. The molecular mechanism underlying this microtubule array reorientation involves katanin, a microtubule severing enzyme, and a plant-specific microtubule associated protein called SPIRAL2. Katanin preferentially severs longitudinal microtubules, generating seeds that amplify the longitudinal array. Upon severing, SPIRAL2 binds nascent microtubule minus ends and limits their dynamics, thereby stabilizing the longitudinal array while the lateral array undergoes net depolymerization. To date, no experimental structural information is available for SPIRAL2 to help inform its mechanism. To gain insight into SPIRAL2 structure and function, we determined a 1.8 [A] resolution crystal structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana SPIRAL2 C-terminal domain. The domain is composed of seven core -helices, arranged in an -solenoid. Amino-acid sequence conservation maps primarily to one face of the domain involving helices 1, 3, 5, and an extended loop, the 6-7 loop. The domain fold is similar to, yet structurally distinct from the C-terminal domain of Ge-1 (an mRNA decapping complex factor involved in P-body localization) and, surprisingly, the C-terminal domain of the katanin p80 regulatory subunit. The katanin p80 C-terminal domain heterodimerizes with the MIT domain of the katanin p60 catalytic subunit, and in metazoans, binds the microtubule minus-end factors CAMSAP3 and ASPM. Structural analysis predicts that SPIRAL2 does not engage katanin p60 in a mode homologous to katanin p80. The SPIRAL2 structure highlights an interesting evolutionary convergence of domain architecture and microtubule minus-end localization between SPIRAL2 and katanin complexes, and establishes a foundation upon which structure-function analysis can be conducted to elucidate the role of this domain in the regulation of plant microtubule arrays.",

    "abstract": "DNA integrity is a key issue in gene therapy and genetic vaccine approaches based on plasmid DNA. In contrast to messenger RNA that requires a controlled cold chain for efficacy, DNA molecules are considered to be more stable. In this study, we challenged this concept by characterizing the immunological response induced by a plasmid DNA vaccine delivered using electroporation. As a model, we used COVID-eVax, which is a plasmid DNA vaccine that targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Increased nicked DNA was produced by using either an accelerated stability protocol or a lyophilization protocol. Surprisingly, the immune response induced in vivo was only minimally affected by the percentage of open circular DNA. This result suggests that plasmid DNA vaccines, such as COVID-eVax that has completed a phase I clinical trial, retain their efficacy upon storage at higher temperatures and this feature may facilitate their use in low-/middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "The characteristic  bi-lobed organization of the kinetochores observed during mitotic metaphase is a result of separation of the sister kinetochores into two clusters upon their stable end-on attachment to the microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. In contrast, during metaphase I of meiosis despite bi-orientation of the homologs, we observe that the kinetochores are linearly dispersed between the two spindle poles indicating that pole-distal and pole-proximal kinetochores are attached laterally and end-on, respectively to the microtubules. Colocalization studies of kinetochores and kinesin motors suggest that budding yeast kinesin 5, Cin8 and Kip1 perhaps localize to the end-on attached kinetochores while kinesin 8, Kip3 resides at all the kinetochores. Unlike mitosis in budding yeast, in meiosis, the outer kinetochores assemble much later after prophase I. From the findings including co-appearance of kinesin 5 and the outer kinetochore protein Ndc80 at the centromeres after prophase I and a reduction in Ndc80 level in Cin8 null mutant, we propose that kinesin motors are required for reassembly and stability of the kinetochores during early meiosis. Thus, this work reports yet another meiosis specific function of kinesin motor.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is essential to facilitate cell-cell adhesion and differentiation. We determined the role of the dolichol phosphate mannosyltransferase (DPM) complex, a central regulator for glycosylation, for desmosomal adhesive function and epidermal differentiation. Deletion of the key molecule of the DPM complex, DPM1, in human keratinocytes resulted in weakened cell-cell adhesion, impaired localization of the desmosomal components desmoplakin and desmoglein-2, and led to cytoskeletal organization defects in human keratinocytes. In a 3D organotypic human epidermis model, loss of DPM1 caused impaired differentiation with abnormally increased cornification, reduced thickness of non-corneal layers, and formation of intercellular gaps in the epidermis. Using proteomic approaches, SERPINB5 was identified as DPM1-dependent interaction partner of desmoplakin. Mechanistically, SERPINB5 reduced desmoplakin phosphorylation at serine 176, which was required for strong intercellular adhesion. These results uncover a novel role of the DPM complex in linking desmosomal adhesion with epidermal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Cell invasion through basement membrane (BM) barriers is important in development, immune function, and cancer progression. As invasion through BM is often stochastic, capturing gene expression profiles of cells actively transmigrating BM in vivo remains elusive. Using the stereotyped timing of C. elegans anchor cell (AC) invasion, we generated an AC transcriptome during BM breaching. Through a focused RNAi screen of transcriptionally enriched genes, we identified new invasion regulators, including TCTP (Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein). We also discovered gene enrichment of ribosomal proteins. AC-specific RNAi, endogenous ribosome labeling, and ribosome biogenesis analysis revealed a burst of ribosome production occurs shortly after AC specification, which drives the translation of proteins mediating BM removal. Ribosomes also strongly localize to the ACs endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the endomembrane system expands prior to invasion. We show that AC invasion is sensitive to ER stress, indicating a heightened requirement for translation of ER trafficked proteins. These studies reveal key roles for ribosome biogenesis and endomembrane expansion in cell invasion through BM and establish the AC transcriptome as a resource to identify mechanisms underlying BM transmigration.",

The key gene for AP patterning, shh, is expressed in a regenerating limb of the tadpole but not in that of the froglet. Genomic DNA in the shh limb-specific enhancer, MFCS1 (ZRS), is hypermethylated in froglets but hypomethylated in tadpoles: shh expression may be controlled by epigenetic regulation of MFCS1. Is MFCS1 specifically activated for regenerating the AP-patterned limb? We generated transgenic Xenopus laevis lines that visualize the MFCS1 enhancer activity with a GFP reporter. The transgenic tadpoles showed GFP expression in hoxd13- and shh-expressing domains of developing and regenerating limbs, whereas the froglets showed no GFP expression in the regenerating limbs despite having hoxd13 expression. Genome sequence analysis and co-transfection assays using cultured cells revealed that Hoxd13 can activate Xenopus MFCS1. These results suggest that MFCS1 activation correlates with regeneration of AP-patterned limbs and that re-activation of epigenetically inactivated MFCS1 would be crucial to confer the ability to non-regenerative animals for regenerating a properly patterned limb.",

This organization is thought to be controlled by interactions of the Sertoli cells, endothelial and interstitial cells with little or no role of germ cells. Challenging this notion, herein we show that the germ cells play an active role in the organization of the testicular tubules. We observed that the LIM-homeobox gene, Lhx2 is expressed in the germ cells of the developing testis between E12.5-E15.5. In Lhx2 knockout-fetal testis there was altered expression of several genes not just in germ cells but also in the supporting (Sertoli) cells, endothelial cells, and interstitial cells. Further, loss of Lhx2 led to disrupted endothelial cell migration and expansion of interstitial cells in the XY gonads. The cords in the developing testis of Lhx2 knockout embryos are disorganized with a disrupted basement membrane. Together, our results show an important role of Lhx2 in testicular development and imply the involvement of germ cells in the tubular organization of the differentiating testis.\n\nHighlightO_LILhx2 is expressed in germ cells of developing mouse testis but is dispensable for germ cell and Sertoli cell specification\nC_LIO_LILoss of Lhx2 disrupts testicular vascularization, leads to the expansion of interstitial cells, and alters the tubular organization\nC_LIO_LIGerm cells govern the tubular organization in the developing testis\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522214v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1761dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1519f12org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a263baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4167f2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The fission yeast S. pombe divides via closed mitosis. In short, mitotic spindle elongation and chromosome segregation transpire entirely within the complete nuclear envelope. Both the spindle and nuclear envelope must undergo significant conformation changes and are subject to varying external forces during this process. While the mechanical relationship between the two mitotic structures has been explored previously1-4, much is still left to be discovered. Here, we investigate this relationship by observing the behaviors of spindles and nuclei in live mitotic fission yeasts following laser ablation. First, we characterize these dynamics in molecularly typical S. pombe spindles, finding them to be stabilized by dense crosslinking, before demonstrating that the compressive force acting on the spindle poles is higher in mitotic cells with greater nuclear envelope tension and that spindle compression can be relieved by lessening nuclear envelope tension. We finally examine the differences between the mitotic apparatus in S. pombe and S. japonicus, an evolutionary relative of S. pombe that undergoes semi-open mitosis, and show that S. japonicus mitotic spindles appear to both splay and bend more easily than those of their S. pombe relatives. Altogether, these data suggest that fission yeast spindle crosslinking may be tuned to support spindle extension and oppose nuclear envelope tension.",

    "abstract": "The molecular hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a chromosomal translocation that results in deregulated expression of MYC oncogene. This translocation is present in virtually all BL. MYC is an oncogenic transcription factor deregulated in about half of total human tumors, by translocation or other mechanisms. Transcriptomic studies reveal more than 1000 genes regulated by MYC but a much smaller fraction of these genes is directly activated by MYC. All the endemic BL and many sporadic BL cells are associated to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The currently accepted mechanism for the MYC and BL association is that EBV is the causing agent inducing MYC translocation. Complement receptor 2 or CR2 (also called CD21) is a membrane protein that serves as EBV receptor in lymphoid cells. Here we show that CR2 is a direct MYC target gene. This conclusion is based on several evidences. First, MYC downregulation is linked to CR2 downregulation both in proliferating and in arrested cells. Second, MYC binds human CR2 promoter and this binding depends on E-box elements. Third, MYC activates CR2 promoter in an E-box dependent manner. Four, MYC activates CR2 transcription in the absence of protein synthesis. Importantly, MYC also induces CR2 expression in mouse primary B cells. Thus, CR2 is a bona fide MYC direct target gene. Moreover, higher MYC expression levels in Burkitt lymphoma-derived cells result in a more efficient EBV infection. We propose an alternative mechanism compatible with the correlation between EBV infection and MYC translocation observed in endemic BL, i.e., that deregulated MYC in BL cells occurs first and favors the EBV infection.",

    "abstract": "Virus infection involves the manipulation of key host cell functions by specialized virulence proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 small accessory proteins ORF3a and ORF7a have been implicated in favoring virus replication and spreading by inhibiting the autophagic flux within the host cell. Here, we apply yeast models to gain insights into the physiological functions of both SARS-CoV-2 small ORFs. ORF3a and ORF7a can be stably overexpressed in yeast cells, producing a decrease in cellular fitness. Both proteins show a distinguishable intracellular localization. ORF3a specifically localizes to the vacuolar membrane, whereas ORF7a targets the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of ORF3a and ORF7a leads to the accumulation of Atg8 specific autophagosomes. However, the underlying mechanism is different for each viral protein as assessed by the quantification of the autophagic degradation of Atg8-GFP fusion proteins, which is inhibited by ORF3a and stimulated by ORF7a. Overexpression of both SARS-CoV-2 ORFs decreases cellular fitness upon starvation conditions, where autophagic processes become essential. These data are in agreement with a model where both small ORFs have synergistic functions in stimulating intracellular autophagosome accumulation, ORF3a by inhibiting autophagosome processing at the vacuole and ORF7a by promoting autophagosome formation at the ER. ORF3a has an additional function in Ca2+ homeostasis. The overexpression of ORF3a confers calcineurin-dependent Ca2+ tolerance and activates a Ca2+ sensitive FKS2-luciferase reporter, suggesting a possible ORF3a-mediated Ca2+ efflux from the vacuole. Taken together, we show that viral accessory proteins can be functionally investigated in yeast cells and that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF7a proteins interfere with autophagosome formation and processing as well as with Ca2+ homeostasis from distinct cellular targets.",

    "abstract": "Since the pioneering work by Moeller, Szabo and Bullock, weakly electric fish have been widely used as a model to approach the study of both spatial and social cognitive abilities in a vertebrate taxon typically less approachable than mammals or other terrestrial vertebrates. Through their electric organ, weakly electric fish generate low-intensity electric fields around their bodies with which they scan the environment to orient themselves and interact with conspecifics even in complete darkness. The brown ghost knifefish is probably the most intensely studied species due to the large repertoire of individually variable and sex-specific electric signals it produces. Their rich electric vocabulary is composed of brief frequency modulations - or chirps - of the oscillating dipole moment emitted continuously by their electric organ. Chirps of different types are thought to convey very specific and behaviorally salient information, and are thus used as references to specific internal states during recordings - of either the brain or the electric organ - or during behavioral observations. However, while this notion undoubtedly contributed to the success of this model in neuroethology during the past seven decades, the logic underlying this electric communication still remains unclear.\n\nThis study re-evaluates this view in the attempt to provide an alternative, and perhaps complementary, explanation for why these freshwater bottom dwellers emit electric chirps. By revealing correlations between chirping, electric field geometry and detectability in enriched environments, we provide evidence for a previously unexplored role of chirps as specialized self-directed signals used to expand conspecific electrolocation ranges during social encounters.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is functionally one of the most complex regions of mammalian brain. Unlike other cortical areas that process single sensory modalities (like vision, touch, smell, etc.), the PFC integrates information across brain regions to regulate diverse functions ranging from cognition, emotion, executive action to even pain sensitivity. However, it is unclear how such diverse functions are organized at the cellular and circuit levels within the anatomical modules of the PFC. Here we employed spatially resolved single-cell transcriptome profiling to decode PFCs organizational heterogeneity. The results revealed that PFC has very distinct cell type composition relative to all neighboring cortical areas. Interestingly, PFC also adopts specialized transcriptional features, different from all neighbors, with differentially expressed genes regulating neuronal excitability. The projections to major subcortical targets of PFC emerge from combinations of neuron subclusters determined in a target-intrinsic fashion. These cellular and molecular features further segregated within subregions of PFC, alluding to the subregion-specific specialization of several PFC functions. Finally, using these unique cellular, molecular and projection properties, we identified distinct cell types and circuits in PFC that engage in pathogenesis of chronic pain. Collectively, we not only present a comprehensive organizational map of the PFC, critical for supporting its diverse functions, but also reveal the cluster and circuit identity of a pathway underlying chronic pain, a rapidly escalating healthcare challenge limited by molecular understanding of maladaptive PFC circuits.\n\nMajor pointsO_LIPFC adopts unique cellular composition, distinct from other cortical areas\nC_LIO_LISelective transcriptomic features emerge in PFC to support its divergent functional portfolio\nC_LIO_LISubcortical projections of PFC assume target-intrinsic specification for innervating clusters\nC_LIO_LIA molecularly defined L5 projection neuron cluster (to PAG) potentially mediates chronic pain pathogenesis\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is an indispensable tool in epilepsy, sleep, and behavioral research. In rodents, EEG recordings are typically performed with metal electrodes that traverse the skull into the epidural space. In addition to requiring a major surgery, this intracranial EEG technique is difficult to perform for more than a few electrodes, is time-intensive, and confounds experiments studying traumatic brain injury. Here, we describe an open-source cost-effective refinement of this technique for chronic mouse EEG recording. Our alternative two channel (EEG2) and sixteen channel high-density EEG (HdEEG) arrays use electrodes made of the novel, flexible 2D nanomaterial titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene. The MXene electrodes are placed on the surface of the intact skull and establish electrical connection without conductive gel or paste. Fabrication and implantation times of MXene EEG electrodes are significantly shorter than the standard approach and recorded resting baseline and epileptiform EEG waveforms are similar to those obtained with traditional epidural electrodes. Applying HdEEG to a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) model in mice of both sexes revealed that mTBI significantly altered awake resting state spectral density with a spatiospectral region of interest in the {beta} spectral band (12-30 Hz) in the central and posterior regions. These findings indicate that fabrication of MXene electrode arrays is a cost effective, efficient technology for multichannel EEG recording in rodents that obviates the need for skull-penetrating surgery. Moreover, increased {beta} spectral power may contribute to the development of early post-mTBI seizures.\n\nSignificance StatementElectroencephalography (EEG) is a critical technique used to study neurological activity in rodents. Commonly used EEG procedures require time-consuming skull-penetrating surgeries that may confound the experiments. Here we provide a cost-effective solution for obtaining two channel (EEG2) and high-density EEG (HdEEG) recordings on the skull surface thus avoiding major surgery. We compared this HdEEG system to traditional EEG recordings and then used it to determine the effects of mild traumatic brain injury on awake resting state spectral density. This novel open-source EEG system will contribute the electrophysiological characterization of rodent behaviors and seizure activity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a global healthcare crisis. The TgF344-AD rat is an AD model exhibiting age-dependent AD pathological hallmarks. We confirmed that AD rats developed cognitive deficits at 6 months without alteration of any other major biophysical parameters. We longitudinally characterized cerebral hemodynamics in AD rats at 3, 4, 6, and 14 months. The myogenic responses of the cerebral arteries and arterioles were impaired at 4 months of age in the AD rats. Consistent with the ex vivo results, the AD rat exhibited poor autoregulation of surface and deep cortical cerebral blood flow two months preceding cognitive decline. The dysfunction of cerebral hemodynamics in AD is exacerbated with age associated with reduced cerebral perfusion. Further, abolished cell contractility contributes to cerebral hemodynamics imbalance in AD. This may be attributed to enhanced ROS production, reduced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, and disrupted actin cytoskeleton in cerebral vascular contractile cells.",

    "abstract": "The functional output of the hippocampus, a brain region subserving memory processes, depends on highly orchestrated cellular and molecular processes that regulate synaptic plasticity throughout life. The structural requirements of such plasticity and molecular processes involved in this regulation are poorly understood. Specific molecules, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) have been implicated in processes of plasticity in the hippocampus, a role that decreases with brain aging as expression is lost. Here, we report that TIMP2 is highly expressed by neurons within the hippocampus and its loss drives changes in cellular programs related to adult neurogenesis and dendritic spine turnover with corresponding impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory. Consistent with the accumulation of ECM in the hippocampus we observe with aging, we find that TIMP2 acts to reduce accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) around synapses in the hippocampus. Moreover, its removal results in hindrance of newborn neuron migration through a denser ECM network. A novel conditional TIMP2 KO mouse reveals that neuronal TIMP2 regulates adult neurogenesis, accumulation of ECM, and ultimately hippocampus-dependent memory. Our results define a mechanism whereby hippocampus- dependent function is regulated by TIMP2 and its interactions with the ECM to regulate diverse processes associated with synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the single-copy RNU4ATAC gene, which encodes U4atac snRNA of the minor spliceosome are linked to the developmental disorder microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I). Partial loss-of-function mutations of U4atac snRNA lead to a poor prognosis, with less than three year survival. The most prominent characteristic of MOPD I is disrupted central nervous system development resulting in severe microcephaly and lissencephaly.\n\nIn this study, we used self-organizing 3D cerebral organoids from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate defective cellular events that disturb the laminar organization of the cortex and influence brain topology. We analyzed organoids from iPSCs homozygous for the partial loss-of-function U4atac snRNA 51G>A mutation and compared them to isogenic organoids obtained from iPSCs expressing wild-type U4atac snRNA, using immunostaining and 10X Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing. In our MOPD I organoids, we observed: a) reduced proliferation accompanied by premature neurogenesis depleting the neuro-progenitor pool due to an increased frequency of horizontal cell divisions in the ventricular zone; b) reduced numbers of intermediate progenitor and outer radial glial cells in the outer sub-ventricular zone; and c) defective radial neuronal migration, which is critical for cortical expansion in humans. Our findings therefore provide insight into MOPD I cellular pathogenesis and underline the value of these cerebral organoids as model systems for human neurodevelopmental disorders.",

A brief trip to the Antarctic summer (ANT) allowed us to explore the impact of a sudden and synchronized increase in light exposure on activity-rest rhythms and sleep patterns of 11 Uruguayan university students, and to assess the significance of light history in determining individual circadian phase shift. Measurements collected in the peri-equinox in Montevideo, Uruguay (baseline situation, MVD) and in ANT, included sleep logs, actigraphy, and salivary melatonin to determine dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), the most reliable marker of circadian phase. The increase in light exposure in ANT with respect to MVD (affecting both light-sensitive windows with opposite effects on the circadian phase) resulted in no net change in DLMO among participants as some participants advanced their DLMO and some others delayed it. The ultimate cause of each participants distinctive circadian phase shift relied on the unique change in light exposure each individual was subjected to between their MVD and ANT. This is the first study to show a clear physiological effect of light either advancing or delaying the circadian phase dependent on individual light history in an ecological study.",

Here, we combined multiple new techniques to develop TRIC-DISCO, a new pipeline that allows imaging of RNA spatial distributions in whole adult mouse brains. First, we developed Tris-mediated retention of in situ hybridization signal during clearing (TRIC), which produces highly transparent tissue while maintaining the RNA signal intensities. We then combined TRIC with DISCO clearing (TRIC-DISCO) by controlling temperature during the in situ hybridization chain reaction (isHCR) to ensure uniform whole-brain staining. This pipeline eliminates the requirements for both strict RNase-free environments and workflow-compatible RNase inhibitors. Our TRIC-DISCO pipeline enables simple and robust, single-cell, whole-brain, 3D imaging of transcriptional signatures, cell-identity markers, and noncoding RNAs across the entire brain.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated whether neonatal exposure to the proinflammatory endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by antibiotic (ATB)-induced dysbiosis in early adulthood could induce schizophrenia-like behavioral changes in adult male rats. The combination of these two stressors resulted in decreased weight gain, but no significant behavioral abnormalities were observed. LPS treatment resulted in adult rats hypoactivity and induced anxiety-like behavior in the social recognition paradigm, but these behavioral changes were not exacerbated by ATB-induced gut dysbiosis. ATB treatment seriously disrupted the gut bacterial community, but dysbiosis did not affect locomotor activity, social recognition, and acoustic reactivity in adult rats. Fecal bacterial community analyzes showed no differences between the LPS challenge exposed/unexposed rats, while the effect of ATB administration was decisive regardless of prior LPS exposure. ATB treatment resulted in significantly decreased bacterial diversity, suppression of Clostridiales and Bacteroidales, and increases in Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriales, and Burkholderiales. The persistent effect of LPS on some aspects of behavior suggests a long-term effect of early toxin exposure that was not observed in ATB-treated animals. However, an anti-inflammatory protective effect of ATB cannot be assumed because of the increased abundance of pro-inflammatory, potentially pathogenic bacteria (Proteus, Suttrella) and the elimination of the bacterial families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, which are generally considered beneficial for gut health.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing of mRNA exons in mammalian neurons increases diversity of the proteome and is regulatable by signaling pathways. However, the degree of conservation of basal and signal-dependent exon usage between human neurons and those from experimental models such as mice is incompletely understood. We previously showed that cortical neuronal activity-dependent gene transcription exhibits human/mouse differences, driven by evolutionary divergence of cis-acting promoter elements (Qiu et al. 2016). Since alternative exon usage influences brain development and cognition, is controlled by neuronal activity, and is disturbed in brain disorders, we investigated human/mouse differences in exon usage in cortical neurons. Comparing orthologous exons, basal exon inclusion levels showed human-mouse conservation, but also significant differences determined by cis-acting sequences: human-mouse conservation and divergence in exon usage was recapitulated in neurons from Tc1 mice carrying human chromosome-21 (hCh21). Activity-dependent changes in exon usage also exhibited significant conservation: gene structure was more likely to be conserved in activity-regulated exons, and exons regulated in both human and mouse neurons were enriched in RBFOX and SAM68 targets, and genes were centred on cytoskeletal organisation, mRNA transcription/processing, and synaptic signaling. However, divergence was also evident, and human-specific activity-dependent exon usage was dominated by genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, signaling and trafficking. Notably, the pattern of activity-dependent usage of hCh21 exons in human neurons was not recapitulated in mouse Tc1 neurons. Thus, unlike species-specific differences in activity-dependent gene transcription, cis-acting DNA sequence divergence is insufficient to explain inter-species differences in activity-regulated exon usage. Trans-acting factors involved in activity-responsive splicing have likely also diverged.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) produces aggregable {beta}-amyloid peptides and its mutations are associated with familial Alzheimers disease, which makes it one of the most studied proteins. However, APPs role in the human brain remains unclear despite years of investigation. One problem is that most studies on APP have been carried out in cell lines or model organisms, which are physiologically different from human neurons in the brain. Recently, human induced neurons (hiNs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells provide a practical platform for studying the human brain in vitro. Here, we generated APP-null iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and differentiate them to matured human neurons with functional synapses using a two-step procedure. During hiN differentiation and maturation, APP-null cells exhibited less neurite growth and reduced synaptogenesis in serum-free but not serum-containing media. We have found that cholesterol (Chol) remedies those developmental defects in APP-null cells, consistent with Chols role in neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis. Phenotypic rescue was also achieved by co-culturing those cells with wildtype mouse astrocytes, suggesting that APPs developmental role is likely astrocytic. Next, we examined matured hiNs using patch-clamp recording and detected reduced synaptic transmission in APP-null cells. This change was largely due to decreased synaptic vesicle (SV) release and retrieval, which was confirmed by live-cell imaging using two SV-specific fluorescent reporters. Adding Chol shortly before stimulation mitigated the SV deficits in APP-null iNs, indicating that APP facilitates presynaptic membrane Chol turnover during SV exo-/endocytosis cycle. Taken together, our study in hiNs supports the notion that APP contributes to neurodevelopment, synaptogenesis and neurotransmission via maintaining brain Chol homeostasis. Given the vital role of Chol in the central nervous system, the functional connection between APP and Chol bears important implication in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "The frontal eye field (FEF) is a cortical area classically associated with spatial attention, perception, and oculomotor functions. FEF exhibits complex response properties through mixed selectivity neurons, allowing a high dimensional representation of the information. However, recent studies have shown that FEF encodes information in a low-dimensional regime hence limiting the coding capacity of the neural population. How the FEF encodes multiple sources of information with such limited encoding capacity remains elusive. To address this question, we trained two macaques to perform a visual attention task while we recorded FEF neuronal activity using multi-contact electrodes. FEF neurons encoded task- (time in the trial; CTOA) and behaviour- (reaction time, RT; focus of attention, TA) related parameters prior to the target onset. We found a clear modulation of the RT and TA as a function of the CTOA. Using dPCA, we characterized the functional relationship between neural populations associated with each parameter and investigated how this functional relationship predicts behaviour. We found that CTOA variability was associated with two different components the activation of which was correlated with the TA and the RT, respectively. These CTOA-related components were non-orthogonal with the RT and TA-related components, respectively. These results suggest that, when different sources of information are implemented during task performance, they show a very precise geometrical configuration in non-orthogonal components, which allows a high capacity of information coding at a cost of modulating both the capacity of the monkey to use attention information and its responsiveness toward external stimuli.",

    "abstract": "GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Membrane currents evoked by GABAA receptor activation have uniquely small driving forces: their reversal potential (EGABA) is very close to the resting membrane potential. As a consequence, GABAA currents can flow in either direction, depending on both the membrane potential and the local intra and extracellular concentrations of the primary permeant ion, chloride (Cl). Local cytoplasmic Cl concentrations vary widely due to displacement of mobile Cl ions by relatively immobile anions. Here we describe new reporters of extracellular chloride (Cl-o) and demonstrate that Cl is displaced in the extracellular space by high and spatially heterogenous concentrations of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs). Cl-o varies widely, and the mean Cl-o is only half the canonical concentration, i.e. the Cl concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. Cl-o microdomains provide a mechanism to link the varied but highly stable distribution of sGAGs in the brains extracellular space to neuronal signal processing via the effects on the amplitude and direction of GABAA transmembrane Cl currents.",

Previous studies have focused on determining the cortical networks shaped by numeracy and literacy in the human brain, partially supporting the hypothesis of distinct neural circuits involved the processing of the two categories. In this study, we aim to investigate the temporal dynamics for number and letter processing. We present MEG data from two experiments (N=20 each). In the first experiment, single numbers, letter, and their respective false fonts (false numbers and false letters) were presented, whereas, in the second experiment, numbers, letters, and their respective false fonts were presented as a string of characters. We used multivariate pattern analysis techniques (time-resolved decoding and temporal generalization) testing the strong hypothesis that the neural mechanisms supporting letter and number processing can be logistically classified as categorically separate. Our results show a very early dissociation ([~]100 ms) between numbers, and letters when compared to false fonts. Number processing can be dissociated with similar accuracy when presented as isolated items or strings of characters, while letter processing shows dissociable classification accuracy for single items compared to strings. These findings reinforce the evidence indicating that early visual processing can be differently shaped by the experience with numbers and letters; this dissociation is stronger for strings compared to single items, thus showing that combinatorial mechanisms for numbers and letters could be categorically distinguished and influence early brain activity.",

While blood-borne proteins associated with either youth or old age have been targeted to restore function to the aged brain, it remains unclear whether other dysfunctional systemic states can be exploited for similar benefits. Here we investigate whether APOE allelic variation or presence of brain amyloid are associated with distinct proteomic changes within the systemic environment and what molecular processes are associated with these changes.\n\nMethodsUsing the SOMAscan assay, we measured 1,305 plasma proteins from 53 homozygous APOE3 and APOE4 subjects (mean age = 68 years; minimum = 54 years) who exhibited no cognitive impairment, some of whom can be categorized as harboring cerebral amyloid based on cerebrospinal fluid A{beta}42 measurements. Using the Dream R package for linear mixed effects modeling, we investigated possible contributions of either the APOE-{varepsilon}4 allele or amyloid positivity to changes in the plasma proteome. Ontology-based pathway and module trait correlation analyses were performed to understand disrupted pathways that vary based on APOE genotype or amyloid positivity.\n\nResultsWe found that expression of the APOE-{varepsilon}4 allele produced distinct changes in the composition of the plasma proteome. Using both pathway enrichment analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we found that plasma proteins associated with APOE4 expression were linked to pathways related to atherosclerosis, lipid transport, the extracellular matrix, and synaptogenesis signaling. Independent of APOE4, we found that cognitively normal, amyloid-positive subjects exhibit distinct plasma proteome signatures associated with pathways previously linked to AD pathology, relative to amyloid-negative controls. Harboring brain amyloid was associated with plasma proteomic changes linked to dysfunction in blood-brain barrier and other neural cell types. Our results indicate that changes in the plasma proteome are related to possession of AD risk alleles, as well as the presence of amyloid pathology in subjects prior to the onset of symptoms. This work highlights the possibility that pathways in the systemic environment in certain risk contexts may be plausible targets to explore for modulating disease.",

    "abstract": "Rapid-acting antidepressants like ketamine hold promise to change the approach to treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD),1-3 but their cellular and molecular targets remain unclear. Passivity induced by behavioral futility underlies learned helplessness, a process that becomes maladaptive in MDD.4, 5 Antidepressants inhibit futility-induced passivity (FIP) in rodent models such as the forced swimming6 or tail suspension7 tasks, but these models lack the throughput and accessibility for screening compounds and investigating their effects on the brain in vivo. Therefore, we adapted a recently discovered FIP behavior8 in the small and optically accessible larval zebrafish to create a scalable behavioral assay for antidepressant action. We found that rapid-acting antidepressants with diverse pharmacological targets demonstrated a suppression of FIP conserved between fish and rodents. While fast-acting antidepressants are thought to primarily target neurons,2, 9, 10 using brain-wide imaging in vivo we found, surprisingly, that ketamine, but not psychedelics or typical antidepressants, drove cytosolic calcium elevation in astroglia lasting many minutes. Blocking neural activity did not prevent ketamines effects on FIP or astroglial calcium, suggesting an astroglia-autonomous mechanism of ketamines action. Chemogenetic and optogenetic perturbations of astroglia reveal that the aftereffects of calcium elevation are sufficient to suppress FIP by inhibiting astroglial integration of futile swimming. In sum, our work provides evidence that ketamine exerts its antidepressant effects by inhibiting an astroglial population that integrates futility and changes behavioral state. Astroglia play central roles in modulating circuit dynamics,11 and our work argues that targeting astroglial signaling may be a fruitful strategy for designing new rapid-acting antidepressants.",

    "abstract": "Neurons communicate with vasculature to regulate blood flow in the brain. The cells that maintain this are collectively named the neurovascular unit (NVU). This communication, known as neurovascular coupling, is thought to involve astrocytes or molecules that can pass through the astrocytic endfeet. However, the exact mechanism is still unclear. Using large 3D electron microscopy datasets, we can now study the entire NVU in context. In this study, I provide evidence for the role of precapillary sphincters as a hub for neurovascular coupling and endothelial transcytosis, as well as the role of collagen synthesized by fibroblasts in strengthening first-order capillaries. I also show how astrocytic endfeet form a barrier for fluid flow and how the microvasculature of the cortex is not innervated but is surrounded by a surprising organization of parenchymal neuronal processes around penetrating arterioles and arterial-end capillaries in both mouse and human brains.\n\nSignificance statementThe neurovascular unit (NVU) is made up of various types of cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, which work together to regulate blood flow in response to changes in neural activity. This process, known as neurovascular coupling, is crucial for ensuring that the brain receives an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. This study suggests a novel organization of the NVU and neurovascular coupling. Through ultrastructural analysis, I was able to identify previously unknown relationships between the different types of cells in the NVU. These findings provide new insights into the structure of the NVU and how it functions, which may help researchers develop new strategies for preserving cognitive function and promoting healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are a subtype of extracellular vesicles (EV) that are secreted upon fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. In order to identify proteins responsible for this fusion event, we developed sensitive cellular and cell-free assays to measure exosome secretion. Our results suggest that exosome secretion is coupled to Ca2+-dependent plasma membrane repair. Using a targeted proteomics approach, we identify annexin A6 (ANXA6), a well-known plasma membrane repair protein, as a MVB binding protein and demonstrate that it is required for Ca2+-dependent exosome secretion both in intact and in permeabilized cells. Our results suggest that cells employ MVBs as a membrane source for plasma membrane lesion repair during physiological mechanical stress or treatment with a bacterial pore-forming toxin, and that this repair process results in the coincident secretion of exosomes. We propose that this unconventional secretion process may contribute significantly to the heterogeneity of EVs in biological fluids.",

    "abstract": "1Treatment of acute and chronic pain represent a widespread clinical challenge with poor therapeutic options. While rodents are an invaluable model to study pain, scoring nociceptive responses in clinically relevant paradigms and at high-throughput remains an unmet challenge. Therefore, there is a need for automated, high-throughput methods that sensitively and accurately assess pain and analgesia. Such objective and scalable technologies will enable the discovery of novel analgesics and yield mechanistic insights into the neural and genetic mechanisms of pain. Here, we adopt the open field arena to build a univariate scale for the formalin injection model of inflammatory pain by using a machine learning approach that incorporates 82 behavioral features. This tool outperforms traditional measures of licking and shaking in detection of formalin dose, and was validated using 4 diverse mouse strains. We also detected previously unreported differences in formalin induced nocifensive behaviors that were strain and sex specific. This model also reliably identifies morphine induced antinociception. This novel, sensitive, and inexpensive tool provides a method for quantifying voluntary nociceptive responses to facilitate genetic mapping and analgesic compound screening in a high throughput manner.",

We furthermore identify SATB2-dependent alterations at all 3D genome architectural levels, including compartments, Topologically Associated Domains and Frequently Interacting Regions. Genes linked to SATB2-dependent 3D genome changes are implicated in highly specialized neuronal functions and contribute to cognitive ability and risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The altered non-coding regions are enriched for common variants associated with educational attainment, intelligence and schizophrenia.

    "abstract": "Biological factors are known to influence disease trajectories and treatment effectiveness in alcohol addiction. One important biological factor influencing disease dynamics in alcohol use disorder is sex, as preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that gender influences disease trajectories in subjects with alcohol use disorder. Another critical factor is age at first intoxicating drink, which has been identified as a risk factor for later alcohol binging. Preclinical research allows prospective monitoring of rodents throughout the lifespan, providing very detailed information that cannot be acquired in humans. Lifetime monitoring in rodents can be conducted under highly controlled conditions, during which one can systematically introduce multiple biological and environmental factors that impact behaviors of interest.\n\nHere, we used the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) rat model of alcohol addiction in a computerized drinkometer system to study disease dynamics and transition points of addictive behavior in cohorts of adolescent vs. adult as well as male vs. female rats in direct comparison. Early age of onset of drinking (postnatal day 40) in male rats had surprisingly little impact on the development of drinking behavior and compulsivity (quinine taste adulteration) when compared to rats that started drinking during early adulthood (postnatal day 72). However, female rats showed a stronger resistance to quinine taste adulteration after a history of ADEs, indicative of more pronounced compulsive behavior in females as compared to male rats. Specifically, female rats exhibit during quinine taste adulteration a higher frequency of drinking events and a larger access size, especially from the 20% alcohol solution, resulting in fast intoxication despite taste aversion in a relapse-like situation. Our results suggest that drinking patterns, and specifically solution preference as well as access size, provide a valuable indication into determining compulsive drinking. These findings provide a better understanding of sex and age factors involved in the development of drinking behavior that are important in preclinical development of models of addiction, drug development and exploration options for new treatments.",

    "abstract": "Ants communicate via large arrays of pheromones and possess expanded, highly complex olfactory systems, with antennal lobes in the brain comprising ~500 glomeruli. This expansion implies that odors could activate hundreds of glomeruli, which would pose challenges for higher order processing. To study this problem, we generated the first transgenic ants, expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon imaging, we mapped complete glomerular responses to four ant alarm pheromones. Alarm pheromones robustly activated [&le;]6 glomeruli, and activity maps for the three pheromones inducing panic-alarm in our study species converged on a single glomerulus. These results demonstrate that, rather than using broadly tuned combinatorial encoding, ants employ precise, narrowly tuned, and stereotyped representation of alarm pheromone cues. The identification of a central sensory hub glomerulus for alarm behavior suggests that a simple neural architecture is sufficient to translate pheromone perception into behavioral outputs.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathies, including Alzheimers disease (AD), are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of tau protein encoded by the MAPT (Microtubule Associated Protein Tau) gene. Various strategies targeting mechanisms to reduce tau pathology have been proposed and several tau-directed therapies are being investigated in clinical trials. Our lab previously developed a novel strategy to lower tau protein levels using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), showing that human tau (hTau) reduction in aged PS19 tauopathy mice reversed phosphorylated tau pathology, spared neurons, and prolonged survival. Currently, the tau-lowering ASO is being evaluated in the clinical trials with successful phase 1b results. Similarly, preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the use of other ASOs as effective therapeutic strategies. Acquiring ASOs for research purposes may be limited by partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. However, ASOs can be obtained through commercial vendors. The current study evaluates the efficacy of mouse and human tau-targeting ASOs obtained from a commercial vendor in various mouse models. We show that mice treated with purchased ASOs distribute among various brain cell types including neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Mice treated with tau lowering ASOs show decreased mouse or human tau mRNA and protein levels. In addition, human tau lowering ASO-treated PS19 mice showed decreased phosphorylated tau (AT8) and gliosis relative to saline-treated PS19 mice. The results obtained in PS19 mice are consistent with data obtained from our previous study using a non-commercial tau-lowering ASO. Overall, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of commercially-available tau targeting ASOs in vivo to support their broad use by researchers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe have previously described a tri-culture of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia that accurately mimics the in vivo neuroinflammatory response (both neurotoxic and neuroprotective) to a wide range of neuroinflammatory stimuli. Electrophysiological activity is an essential measure of neuronal function, which is influenced by neuroinflammation. Microelectrode array (MEA) technology is a versatile tool to non-invasively study in vitro neural networks by simultaneously recording electrophysiological activity from multiple sites. In this study, we used extracellular recordings to determine the effect of microglia on neural network formation and stability in primary cortical cultures and monitor the changes in neural activity in response to neuroinflammatory stimuli.\n\nMethodsPrimary neonatal rat cortical tri-cultures of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia or co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes were cultured on custom MEAs and the neural activity was monitored for 21 days in vitro to assess culture maturation and network formation. Quantification of synaptic puncta and averaged spike waveforms were used to determine the difference in excitatory to inhibitory neuron ratio (E/I ratio) of the neurons in tri- and co-cultures. The electrophysiological response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of both culture types were compared.\n\nResultsThe tri- and co-culture showed minimal difference in electrophysiological markers of neural network formation and stability with the exception of a significant increase in spike frequency in the tri-culture at later timepoints (DIV 17 and 21). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the density of either post-synaptic or excitatory pre-synaptic puncta between the culture types. However, characterization of the average spike waveforms revealed that the tri-culture had an E/I ratio much closer to that found in the rat cortex. Finally, only the tri-culture displayed a significant decrease in both the number of active channels and spike frequency following LPS exposure.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that the microglia in the tri-culture do not disrupt neural network formation and stability as quantified using extracellular recordings and may be a better representation of the in vivo cortex due to the closer E/I ratio than more traditional isolated neuron and neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. Additionally, the tri-culture is better able to mimic the neuroinflammatory response to LPS, which was quantified via changes in neural electrophysiological activity.",

Therefore, these women constitute a target population for a vaccine, to date non-existent, against E. coli K1 to prevent these infections.\n\nIn this study, we characterize the immunological and microbiological properties in adult female mice of a live attenuated vaccine candidate and the protection it conferred to newborn mice against severe infection caused by E. coli K1.

    "abstract": "The number of strandings and unusual mortality events that involve cetaceans may have increased, and potential pathogens of the respiratory tract have been found during the examination of individuals in many of these events. However, investigating the health of free-ranging large whales is logistically complex. Given that the core microbiome is key to understanding host-bacteria relationships and to identifying their relevance for individual and population health, we characterized the core respiratory bacteriome of the Eastern North Pacific blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus, using blow samples collected by a small quadracopter drone. 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing revealed 1,326 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), of which 11 were shared by more than 50% of all blue whales and had a relative abundance higher than 0.02%. Cutibacterium, Oceanivirga, Tenacibaculum, and Psychrobacter composed the common core respiratory bacteriome of the blue whale. Additionally, compositional analysis identified 15 bacterial classes dominated by Gammaproteobacteria (27.14%), Bacteroidea (19.83%), and Clostridia (12.89%) as the most representative classes in the respiratory tract of blue whales. However, two whales had a high abundance of bacteria with pathogenic potential, namely Mycoplasma spp. and Streptococcus spp. in their blow. Both bacterial genera have been associated with pulmonary diseases in mammals. Ours is the first study to characterize the respiratory bacteriome of apparently healthy blue whales and is a baseline for future long-term studies on blue whale health, an endangered species of conservation concern.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation of the colon (colitis) is a known risk factor for inflammatory-driven colorectal cancers (idCRC), and intestinal microbiota has been implicated in the etiology of id-CRC. Manipulation of the microbiome is a clinically viable therapeutic approach to limiting id-CRC. To understand the microbiome changes that occur over time in id-CRC, we used a mouse model of idCRC with the treatment of azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and measured the microbiome over time using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We included cohorts where the microbiome was restored using cage bedding swapping and where the microbiome was depleted using antibiotics to compare to untreated animals. We identified consistent increases in Akkermansia in mice receiving horizontal microbiome transfer (HMT), while the control cohort had consistent longitudinal increases in Anaeroplasma and Alistipes. Additionally, fecal lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) concentrations were elevated in unrestored animals compared to restored and antibiotic-treated counterparts following HMT. These observations suggest a potential role for Akkermansia, Anaeroplasma, and Alistipes in regulating colonic inflammation in id-CRC.",

    "abstract": "Exercise training prevents age-related decline in muscle function. Targeting epigenetic aging is a promising actionable mechanism and late-life exercise mitigates epigenetic aging in rodent muscle. Whether exercise training can decelerate, or reverse epigenetic aging in humans is unknown. Here, we performed a powerful meta-analysis of the methylome and transcriptome of an unprecedented number of human skeletal muscle samples (n = 3,176). We show that: 1) individuals with higher baseline aerobic fitness have younger epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles, 2) exercise training leads to significant shifts of epigenetic and transcriptomic patterns towards a younger profile, and 3) muscle disuse \"ages\" the transcriptome. Higher fitness levels were associated with attenuated differential methylation and transcription during aging. Furthermore, both epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles shifted towards a younger state after exercise training interventions, while the transcriptome shifted towards an older state after forced muscle disuse. We demonstrate that exercise training targets many of the age-related transcripts and DNA methylation loci to maintain younger methylome and transcriptome profiles, specifically in genes related to muscle structure, metabolism and mitochondrial function. Our comprehensive analysis will inform future studies aiming to identify the best combination of therapeutics and exercise regimes to optimize longevity.",

    "abstract": "Med15 is a general transcriptional regulator and member of the tail module of the RNA Pol II Mediator complex. The S. cerevisiae Med15 protein has a well-structured N-terminal KIX domain, three Activator Binding Domains (ABDs) and several naturally variable polyglutamine (poly-Q) tracts (Q1, Q2, Q3) embedded in an intrinsically disordered central region, and a C-terminal Mediator Association Domain (MAD). We investigated how the presence of ABDs and changes in length and composition of poly-Q tracts influences Med15 activity and function using phenotypic, gene expression, and transcription factor interaction assays of truncation, deletion, and synthetic alleles. We found that individual Med15 activities were influenced by the number of activator binding domains (ABDs) and adjacent polyglutamine composition. We also observed that distant glutamine tracts and Med15 phosphorylation affected the activities of the KIX domain, suggesting that intramolecular interactions may be required for KIX domain interactions with transcription factors. We conclude that robust Med15 activity required at least the Q1 tract and that the length of that tract modulates activity in a context-dependent manner. We speculate that the glutamine tract provides a degree of intramolecular flexibility that is needed for Med15 function. Finally, we found that loss of Msn2-dependent transcriptional activation in Med15 Q1 tract variants correlates well with a reduction in Msn2:Med15 interaction strength.",

    "abstract": "The SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex is a transcriptional coactivator that both acetylates and deubiquitinates histones. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) subunit, Gcn5, is part of a subcomplex of SAGA called the HAT module. A minimal HAT module complex containing Gcn5 bound to Ada2 and Ada3 is required for full Gcn5 activity on nucleosomes. Deletion studies have suggested that the Ada2 SWIRM domain plays a role in tethering the HAT module to the remainder of SAGA. While recent cryo-EM studies have resolved the structure of the core of the SAGA complex, the HAT module subunits and molecular details of its interactions with the SAGA core could not be resolved. Here we show that the SWIRM domain is required for incorporation of the HAT module into the yeast SAGA complex, but not the ADA complex, a distinct six-protein acetyltransferase complex that includes the SAGA HAT module proteins. In the isolated Gcn5/Ada2/Ada3 HAT module, deletion of the SWIRM domain modestly increased activity but had negligible effect on nucleosome binding. Loss of the HAT module due to deletion of the SWIRM domain decreases the H2B deubiquitinating activity of SAGA, indicating a role for the HAT module in regulating SAGA DUB module activity. A model of the HAT module created with Alphafold Multimer provides insights into the structural basis for our biochemical data, as well as prior deletion studies.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key drivers of various diseases, including cancer. While several antibodies against MMPs are in development, our goal is to construct therapeutic anti-MMP inhibitors based on a natural broad MMP inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (N-TIMP2). To confer high binding specificity toward one MMP type, we extend one of the N-TIMP2 loops, allowing it to interact with the non-conserved MMP surface. Multiple computational designs of the loop were used to design a focused library for yeast surface display, which was sorted for high binding to the target MMP-14 and low binding to off-target MMP-3. Deep sequencing of the two selected populations followed by comparative data analysis was used to identify the most promising variants, which were expressed, purified, and tested for inhibition of MMP-14 and off-target MMPs. Our best N-TIMP2 variant exhibited 29 pM binding affinity to MMP-14 and 2.4 {micro}M affinity to MMP-3, 7500-fold more specific than WT N-TIMP2. Furthermore, the variant inhibited cell invasion with increased potency relative to WT N-TIMP2 in two breast cancer cell lines. We obtained the engineered variant high-accuracy model by including NGS data as input to AlphaFold multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Modeling results together with experimental mutagenesis demonstrate that the loop packs tightly against non-conserved residues on MMP-14 and clashes with MMP-3. This study demonstrates that introduction of loop extensions into inhibitors to stretch to the non-conserved surface of the target proteins is an attractive strategy for conferring high binding specificity in design of MMP inhibitors and other therapeutic proteins.",

    "abstract": "The family of scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB) proteins comprises three members and was first identified as binders of the nuclear matrix/scaffold. Over the past two decades, SAFBs were shown to act in DNA repair, mRNA/(l)ncRNA processing, and as part of protein complexes with chromatin-modifying enzymes. SAFB proteins are approximately-100-kDa-sized dual nucleic acid-binding proteins with dedicated domains in an otherwise largely unstructured context, but whether and how they discriminate DNA- and RNA-binding has remained enigmatic. We here provide the SAFB2 DNA- and RNA-binding SAP and RRM domains in their functional boundaries and use solution NMR spectroscopy to ascribe DNA- and RNA-binding functions. We give insight into their target nucleic acid preferences and map the interfaces with respective nucleic acids on sparse data-derived SAP and RRM domain structures. Further, we provide evidence that the SAP domain exhibits intra-domain dynamics and a potential tendency to dimerise, which may expand its specifically targeted DNA sequence range. Our data provide a first molecular basis of and a starting point towards deciphering DNA- and RNA-binding functions of SAFB2 on the molecular level and serve a basis for understanding its localization to specific regions of chromatin and its involvement in the processing of specific RNA species.",

While most of the approximately 500,000 L1 copies are no longer able to propagate, those that retain activity can harm the cell by creating mutations, generating DNA damage, and triggering the expression of inflammatory factors such as the host interferon anti-viral response. Therefore, inhibition of L1 could be used to treat a variety of diseases associated with these processes. Previous research has focused on inhibition of the L1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, in part due to the prevalence of well-characterized existing inhibitors to related viral enzymes. Here we present the L1 endonuclease (EN) as an additional target for reducing the detrimental effects of L1 expression. We have screened and characterized a set of structurally diverse small molecule EN inhibitors using computational, biochemical, and cellular methods. We also show that these inhibitors reduce DNA damage created by L1 and inflammation reinforced by L1 activity in senescent cells. These inhibitors could be further used to modulate endogenous L1 function to better understand the lifecycle of this ubiquitous disease-relevant element.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages employ an array of pattern recognition receptors to detect and eliminate intracellular pathogens that access the cytosol. The cytosolic carbohydrate sensors Galectin-3, -8, and -9 (Gal-3, Gal-8, and Gal-9) recognize damaged pathogen-containing phagosomes, and Gal-3 and Gal-8 are reported to restrict bacterial growth via autophagy in cultured cells. However, the contribution of these galectins to host resistance during bacterial infection remains unclear. We found that Gal-9 binds directly to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Stm) and localizes to Mtb in macrophages. To determine the combined contribution of membrane damage-sensing galectins to immunity in vivo, we generated Gal-3, -8, and - 9 triple knockout (TKO) mice. Mtb infection of primary macrophages from TKO mice resulted in defective lysosomal trafficking but normal bacterial replication. Surprisingly, these mice had no discernable defect in resistance to acute infection with Mtb, Stm or Listeria monocytogenes, and had only modest impairments in bacterial growth restriction and CD4 T cell activation during chronic Mtb infection. Collectively, these findings indicate that while Gal-3, -8, and -9 respond to an array of intracellular pathogens, together these membrane damage-sensing galectins play a limited role in host resistance to bacterial infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryIntracellular bacterial pathogens cause many of the worlds most deadly infectious diseases. A common requirement for nearly all intracellular pathogens is the ability to damage the endomembrane compartments in which they reside, which allows pathogens access to the nutrient-rich cytosol of the host. However, membrane damage also creates a \"pattern of pathogenesis\" that triggers antimicrobial immune responses. Galectin-3, -8, and -9 (Gal-3, Gal-8, and Gal-9) act as a surveillance system for membrane damage and Gal-3 and Gal-8 inhibit bacterial growth by activating autophagy, a cellular pathway that can capture cytosolic bacteria and degrade them in lysosomes. Membrane damage-sensing galectins were hypothesized to promote bacterial killing during acute infection yet their role in the immune response of an infected animal remains unclear. Here, we show that mice deficient for Gal-3, -8, and -9 had no defects in resistance to acute infection with the pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and were only modestly susceptible to chronic Mtb infection. Our data suggest that Gal-3, -8 and -9 are not critical for innate immune responses during acute infection and may play a more prominent role in the adaptive immune response. These results broaden our understanding of the role of membrane damage-sensing pathways in host defense against bacterial infection.",

In addition, there is growing recognition that compromising the microbiota, through the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, may affect patient health in the long term. Therefore, there is the need to develop new -cidal strategies to combat Gram-negative infections that would consider these specific issues. In this study, we report and characterize one such approach, the antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that combine (i) targeting a specific pathogenic organism through a monoclonal antibody with (ii) the high killing activity of antimicrobial peptides. We focused on a major pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium associated with antibacterial resistance: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and designed an ADC by fusing an antimicrobial peptide at the C-terminal end of the VH and/or VL-chain of a monoclonal antibody, VSX, that targets the core of P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This ADC demonstrated appropriately minimal levels of toxicity to mammalian cells and rapidly kills P. aeruginosa strains through several mechanisms while protecting mice from P. aeruginosa lung infection when administered therapeutically. Furthermore, we found that the ADC was synergistic with several classes of antibiotics. This approach described in this study may result in a widely useful strategy to target specific pathogenic microorganisms without augmenting further antibiotic resistance.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe increasing of emerging drug resistant bacterial infections is a worldwide issue and infections caused by antibiotic resistant Gram-negative pathogens are particularly concerning. In addition, there is now growing recognition that disruption of the microbiota, through the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, may affect patient health in the long term.

We previously described \"IN-Sequence\" (IN-Seq) where heart tissue lysate is sequentially partitioned into three subcellular fractions to increase the proteome coverage than a single direct tissue analysis by mass spectrometry. Here, we report an adaptation of the high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) coupled to mass spectrometry, and the establishment of a simple one step sample preparation coupled with gas-phase fractionation. FAIMS approach substantially reduces manual sample handling, significantly shortens MS instrument processing time, and produces unique protein identification and quantification approximating the commonly used IN-Seq method in for less time requirement.",

    "abstract": "Cell proliferation is central to epithelial tissue development, repair and homeostasis. During cell division, small RhoGTPases control both actomyosin dynamics and cell-cell junction remodelling to faithfully segregate the duplicated genome while maintaining tissue polarity and integrity. To decipher the mechanisms of RhoGTPases spatiotemporal regulation during epithelial cell division, we generated a transgenic fluorescently tagged library for Drosophila Rho Guanine exchange factors (GEF) and GTPase activating proteins (GAP), and systematically characterized their endogenous distributions by time- lapse microscopy. Thereby, we unveiled candidate regulators of the interplay between actomyosin and junctional dynamics during epithelial cell division. Building on these findings, we uncovered that during cytokinesis, Cysts and RhoGEF4 play sequential roles in mechanosensing and de novo junction formation, respectively. We foresee that the RhoGEF/GAP library will be a key resource to understand the broad range of biological processes regulated by RhoGTPases.",

    "abstract": "The ability of cells to store and rapidly mobilize energy reserves in response to nutrient availability is essential for survival. Breakdown of carbon stores produces acetyl-coenzyme-A (acetyl-CoA), which fuels various metabolic pathways and is also the acyl donor for protein lysine acetylation. Notably, histone acetylation is sensitive to acetyl-CoA availability and nutrient replete conditions induce a substantial accumulation of acetylation on histones. Deacetylation releases acetate, which can be recycled to acetyl-CoA, suggesting that deacetylation could be mobilized as an acetyl-CoA source to feed downstream metabolic processes under nutrient depletion. While the notion of histones as a metabolic reservoir has been frequently proposed, experimental evidence has been lacking. Therefore, to test this concept directly, we developed an experimental system to trace deacetylation-derived acetate and its incorporation into acetyl-CoA, using 13C2-acetate in ATP citrate lyase-deficient fibroblasts (Acly-/- MEFs), which are primarily dependent on acetate for protein acetylation. We find that dynamic protein deacetylation in Acly-/- MEFs contributes carbons to acetyl-CoA and proximal downstream metabolites. However, there is no significant effect on acyl-CoA pool sizes, and even at maximal acetylation, deacetylation transiently supplies approximately 9% of cellular acetyl-CoA. Together, our data reveal that although protein acetylation is dynamic and sensitive to nutrient availability, its potential for maintaining cellular acetyl-CoA-dependent metabolic pathways is limited compared to cellular demand.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA2, greatly increase an individuals lifetime risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA2 suppresses tumor formation by potentiating DNA repair via homologous recombination. Central to recombination is the assembly of a RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, which forms on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generated at or near the site of chromosomal damage. However, Replication Protein-A (RPA) rapidly binds to and continuously sequesters this ssDNA, imposing a kinetic barrier to RAD51 filament assembly that suppresses unregulated recombination. Recombination mediator proteins--of which BRCA2 is the defining member in humans --alleviate this kinetic barrier to catalyze RAD51 filament formation. We combined microfluidics, microscopy, and micromanipulation to directly measure both the binding of full-length BRCA2 to--and the assembly of RAD51 filaments on--a region of RPA-coated ssDNA within individual DNA molecules designed to mimic a resected DNA lesion common in replication-coupled recombinational repair. We demonstrate that a dimer of RAD51 is minimally required for spontaneous nucleation; however, growth self-terminates below the diffraction limit. BRCA2 accelerates nucleation of RAD51 to a rate that approaches the rapid association of RAD51 to naked ssDNA, thereby overcoming the kinetic block imposed by RPA. Furthermore, BRCA2 eliminates the need for the rate-limiting nucleation of RAD51 by chaperoning a short pre-assembled RAD51 filament onto the ssDNA complexed with RPA. Therefore, BRCA2 regulates recombination by initiating RAD51 filament formation.\n\nSignificanceDespite decades of genetic and cell biological studies, mechanistic biochemical analyses of human BRCA2 function in recombinational DNA repair have only been possible since the purification of full-length BRCA2. These mechanistic studies crucially inform with respect to the molecular function of BRCA2 in genome maintenance. Here, we use single-molecule methods to visualize the assembly of RAD51 on individual RPA-coated ssDNA molecules and to see how this process is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein, BRCA2. We show that BRCA2 serves as a chaperone to nucleate RAD51 and deliver it to RPA-coated ssDNA. This work advances understanding of the molecular functions of BRCA2 and, consequently, the molecular etiology of breast cancer in an important way.",

    "abstract": "PurposePremature infants at risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) miss placental transfer of carotenoids, lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z), during the third trimester. We previously demonstrated that prenatal L and Z supplementation raises carotenoid levels in infants at birth in the Lutein and Zeaxanthin in Pregnancy (L-ZIP) study (NCT03750968). Based on their antioxidant effects and bioavailability, we hypothesized that prenatal maternal supplementation with macular carotenoids would reduce risk of ROP. To test this hypothesis, we utilized \"macular pigment mice\" genetically engineered to take up L and Z into the retina in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR).\n\nMethodsPregnant Bco2-/- mice were divided into nine experimental subgroups based on the type of supplementation (L, Z, or placebo) and on maternal supplementation start date corresponding to the three trimesters of human fetal development (E0, E11, and P1). Pups and nursing mothers were exposed to 75% O2 for 5 days (P7-12) and returned to room air for 5 days (P12-17). Pups were sacrificed at P12 and P17, and their retinas were analyzed for vaso-obliteration (VO) and intravitreal neovascularization (INV).\n\nResultsPups of pregnant mice supplemented with L or Z had significant reductions in VO and INV areas compared to placebo. Prenatal carotenoid supplementation starting at E0 or E11 was significantly more protective against OIR than postnatal supplementation starting at P1.\n\nConclusionPrenatal supplementation with L and Z was beneficial in a mouse OIR model. We recommend testing prenatal L and Z supplementation in future human clinical trials to prevent ROP.",

Specificity of tRNA modification by TRMT2A is achieved by a combination of modest binding preference and presence of a uridine in position 54 of tRNAs. Mutational analysis together with crosslinking experiments identified a large hTRMT2A-tRNA binding surface. Furthermore, complementing hTRMT2A interactome studies revealed that TRMT2A interacts with proteins involved in RNA biogenesis. Finally, we addressed the question of the importance of TRMT2A function by showing that its knockdown reduces translation fidelity.

    "abstract": "Heparosan is a precursor molecule for the widely used anticoagulant heparin, which also has other uses such as certain drug delivery applications and as a scaffold for tissue engineering in biomaterials. Traditionally, pathogenic bacteria such as E.Coli have been used as a host to produce heparosan as an alternative to animal and chemoenzymatic synthesis. Using GRAS status organisms like Lactococcus Lactis as the host for production of heparosan provides a safe alternative as well as being a well-established organism for genetic manipulation and reengineering. In this study, a functional heparosan synthesis pathway was successfully expressed in Lactococcus Lactis by the expression of E.coli K5 genes KfiA and KfiC, along with the overexpression of ugd, glmu and pgma genes present natively in the host organism. The genes were activated using the tightly controlled NICE expression system. The genes were cloned into plasmid p8148 and transformed into two strains, Lactococcus Lactis NZ9000 and Lactococcus Lactis NZ9020, totaling six different recombinant strains were created using these two hosts and various combinations of the heterologous genes. The recombinant Lactococcus Lactis SH6 strain, expressing the genes ugd-KfiA-KfiC-pgma yielded a maximum concentration of 754 mg/l in batch bioreactor experiments and the titer was increased to 1263 mg/l in fed-batch fermentation. NMR imaging successfully determined that the structure of the product derived from Lactococcus Lactis was indeed similar to E.coli heparosan. The molecular weight of heparosan varied from 10-20 KDa, indicating its potential use for chemoenzymatic heparin biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a complex process that strongly depends on environmental conditions and has considerable structural heterogeneity, not only at the level of fibril structure but also at the level of molecular oligomerization. Since the first step in aggregation is the formation of a dimer, it is important to clarify how certain properties (e.g., stability or the interface geometry) of the latter may determine the outcome of aggregation. Here, we developed a simple model that represents the dimers interfacial region by two angles (spanning the so-called growth landscape), and investigate how modulations of the interfacial region occurring on the ns-s timescale change the dimers growth mode. We applied this methodology to 15 different dimer configurations of the {beta}2m D76N mutant protein equilibrated with long MD simulations and identified which of them have limited and unlimited growth modes, with different consequences to their aggregation potential. We found that despite the highly dynamic nature of the starting configurations, most polymeric growth modes tend to be conserved within the studied time scale. The proposed methodology performs remarkably well taking into consideration that the {beta}2m dimers are formed by monomers with detached termini, and their interfaces are stabilized by non-specific apolar interactions, leading to relatively weak binding affinities.",

However, identifying patients with low TMB that are still likely to respond to cancer immunotherapy is an important open challenge. Recently, Spurr et al. 3 reported that the tumor aneuploidy score (AS), defined as the fraction of chromosome arms with arm-level copy number alterations in a sample, is predictive of survival following immunotherapy in low-TMB patients across multiple cancers. By re-analyzing the same data set by performing survival analysis in individual cancer types separately, we find that AS only significantly predicts survival in one single cancer indication. We further find that another metric conceptually related to the AS, the fraction of genome encompassed by copy number alterations (FGA), if called with a conventional copy number calling cutoff, has stronger predictive power than the AS proposed in 3, and that this observation holds even if the FGA and AS thresholds for presence/absence of copy number events are set comparably. However, with the current available data, even FGA can predict survival following immunotherapy in only a few cancer indications.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHDisease-causing mutations in genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) are a recurrent finding in hematopoietic malignancies and might involve key regulators of lineage adherence and cellular differentiation1-3. Such mutations can affect TF-interactions with their cognate DNA-binding motifs4, 5. Whether and how TF-mutations impact upon the nature of binding to TF composite elements (CE) and influence their interaction with other TFs is unclear. Here, we report a new mechanism of TF alteration in human lymphomas with perturbed B cell identity. It is caused by a recurrent somatic missense mutation c.295T>C (p.Cys99Arg; p.C99R) targeting the center of the DNA-binding domain of Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4), a key TF in immune cell-differentiation and -activation6, 7. IRF4-C99R fundamentally alters IRF4 DNA-binding, with loss-of-binding to canonical IRF motifs and neomorphic gain-of-binding to canonical and non-canonical IRF composite elements (CEs). Furthermore, IRF4-C99R thoroughly modifies IRF4 function, by blocking IRF4-dependent plasma cell induction, and up-regulating disease-specific genes in a non-canonical Activator Protein-1 (AP-1)-IRF-CE (AICE)-dependent manner. Our data explain how a single arginine mutation creates a complex switch of TF specificity and gene regulation. These data open the possibility of designing specific inhibitors to block the neomorphic, disease-causing DNA-binding activities of a mutant transcription factor.",

Yet, it is still unclear whether these models truly recapitulate natural aging. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation in multiple tissues of four previously reported mouse models of premature aging (ERCC1, LAKI, POLG and XPG). We estimated DNA methylation (DNAm) age of these samples using the Horvath clock. The most pronounced increase in DNAm age could be observed in ERCC1 mice, a strain which exhibits a deficit in DNA nucleotide excision repair. In line with these results, we detected an increase in epigenetic age in fibroblasts isolated from patients with progeroid syndromes associated with mutations in DNA excision repair genes. These findings highlight ERCC1 as a particularly attractive mouse model to study aging in mammals and suggest a strong connection between DNA damage and epigenetic dysregulation during aging.",

    "abstract": "Insects rely only on their innate immune system to protect themselves from pathogens. Antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production is the main immune reaction in insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, the reaction is regulated mainly by the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways. Spaetzle proteins, activated by immune signals from upstream components, bind to Toll proteins, thus activating the Toll pathway, which in turn induces AMP genes. Previous studies have shown the difference immune ststems related to Toll and IMD pathways between D. melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum. In T. castaneum, 9 Toll and 7 spaetzle genes have been identified. To extend our understanding of AMP production by T. castaneum, we conducted functional assays of Toll and spaetzle genes related to Toll pathway-dependent AMP gene expression in T. castaneum under challenge with bacteria or budding yeast using RNA interference and qRT-PCR. The results revealed that Toll3 and Toll4 double-knockdown and spz7 knockdown strongly and moderately reduced the Toll pathway-dependent expression of AMP genes, respectively. Moreover, Toll3 and Toll4 double-knockdown pupae more rapidly succumbed to entomopathogenic bacteria than the control pupae, but spz7 knockdown pupae did not. The results suggest that Toll3 and Toll4 play a large role in Toll pathway-dependent immune reactions, whereas spz7 plays a small part.",

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins play critical physiological roles as receptors, channels, pumps, and transporters. Despite their importance, however, low expression levels often hamper the experimental characterization of membrane proteins. We present an automated and web-accessible design algorithm called mPROSS (https://mPROSS.weizmann.ac.il), which uses phylogenetic analysis and an atomistic potential, including an empirical lipophilicity scale, to improve native-state energy. As a stringent test, we apply mPROSS to the Kv1.2-Kv2.1 paddle chimera voltage-gated potassium channel. Four designs, encoding 9-26 mutations relative to the parental channel, were functional and maintained potassium-selective permeation and voltage dependence in Xenopus oocytes with up to 14-fold increase in whole-cell current densities. Additionally, single-channel recordings reveal no significant change in the channel-opening probability nor in unitary conductance, indicating that functional expression levels increase without impacting the activity profile of individual channels. Our results suggest that the expression levels of other dynamical channels and receptors may be enhanced through one-shot design calculations.\n\nSignificance statementHeterologous expression levels of membrane proteins are often low, limiting research and applications. We combine homologous-sequence analysis with Rosetta atomistic calculations to enable one-shot design of dozens of mutations that improve native-state energy. Applied to a voltage-gated potassium channel, designs exhibited up to 14-fold improved functional expression levels in oocytes with almost no change in the single-channel activity profile. This design approach may accelerate research of many challenging membrane proteins, including receptors, channels, and transporters.",

    "abstract": "Backed by kinetic schemes, attempts had been made to derive equations for the calculation of all zero-order first-order rate constants (ZOFORC) for the activation of the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex and its deactivation, k+2 and k -2, respectively. The values of ZOFORC, including the kind for the dissociation of the enzyme-product complex (EP) to free enzyme (E) and product (P), are hardly reported. The methods of research were primarily Bernfeld and Lineweaver methods. The goal of the research was to determine ways for the utilization of experimental data for the determination of verifiable and quantifiable rate constants, with the following objectives: 1) To derive equations for the first order rate constants, k+2 and k-2, for the activation of ES and its deactivation, respectively; 2) to quantify by calculation the first order rate constant for product release; 3) ultimately quantify the rate constants, k-2 and k+2; and 4) to advise the reactor, process, chemical engineers, etc. in different industrial concerns on the usefulness of k-2 and k+2. The value of ZOFORC for the dissociation of EP to free E and P is 3.155 exp. (+5)/min; the values of k+2 and k-2 are 3.513 exp. (+4) and 2.377 exp. (+8)/min, respectively. Ultimately, it is imperative for all stakeholder groups to devise means of controlling the enzymatic rate of catalysis by manipulating the magnitudes of k+2 and k-2 in particular. The derived equations can be fitted to the experimentally generated and calculated data. A future research project should entail conducting the assay under optimum conditions so as to verify possible variations in the ZOFORC values when compared with values generated outside optimum conditions.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear Factors (NFs) rapidly scan the genome for their targets, but the role of nuclear organization in such search is uncharted. Here we analyzed how multiple NFs explore chromatin, by combining live-cell single-molecule tracking with multifocal structured illumination of DNA density. We find that NFs displaying higher bound fractions sample DNA dense regions more exhaustively. Focusing on the tumor-suppressor p53, we demonstrated that this NF search for its targets by alternating between rapid diffusion in the interchromatin compartment and compact sampling of chromatin dense regions. Efficient p53 targeting requires balanced IDR/chromatin interactions: adding an exogenous IDR potentiates p53-mediated target gene activation, but excessive IDR/IDR interactions lead to p53 condensates, derailing its search and downregulating transcription. Our findings highlight the role of NF IDRs on their search and showcase a powerful method to generate traffic maps of the eukaryotic nucleus and dissect how nuclear organization guides NFs action.",

To facilitate related studies, we sequenced and assembled the genome of B. sorokiniana strain LK93. Nanopore long reads and next generation sequencing short reads were applied in the genome assembly, and the final 36.4 Mb genome assembly contains 16 contigs with the contig N50 of 2.3 Mb. Subsequently, we annotated 11,811 protein-coding genes including 10,620 functional genes, 258 of which were identified as secretory proteins including 211 predicted effectors. Additionally, the 111,581 bp mitogenome of LK93 was assembled and annotated.

    "abstract": "Organisms have evolved elaborate physiological pathways that regulate growth, proliferation, metabolism, and stress response. These pathways must be properly coordinated to elicit the appropriate response to an ever-changing environment. While individual pathways have been well studied in a variety of model systems, there remains much to uncover about how pathways are integrated to produce systemic changes in a cell, especially in dynamic conditions. We previously showed that deletion of Protein Kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit BCY1 can decouple growth and metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered for anaerobic xylose fermentation, allowing for robust fermentation in the absence of division. This provides an opportunity to understand how PKA signaling normally coordinates these processes. Here, we integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic, and phosphor-proteomic responses upon a glucose to xylose shift across a series of strains with different genetic mutations promoting either coupled or decoupled xylose-dependent growth and metabolism. Together, results suggested that defects in lipid homeostasis limit growth in the bcy1{Delta} strain despite robust metabolism. To further understand this mechanism, we performed adaptive laboratory evolutions to re-evolve coupled growth and metabolism in the bcy1{Delta} parental strain. Genetic mutations in PKA subunit TPK1 and lipid regulator OPI1, among other genes underscored a role for lipid homeostasis, which was further supported by evolved changes in lipid profiles and gene expression. We suggest several models for how cells coordinate growth, metabolism, and other responses in budding yeast and how restructuring these processes enables anaerobic xylose utilization.\n\nAuthor SummaryAll organisms utilize an energy source to generate the cellular resources needed to grow and divide. These individual processes have been well study, but the coordination and crosstalk between the process is not well understood. To study growth and metabolism coupling, we used a yeast strain that was genetically engineered to ferment the sugar xylose but lacked growth on the sugar. The decoupled growth and metabolism was caused by a single gene deletion in a highly conserved signaling pathway found in all eukaryotes. While our work is focused on xylose metabolism, we address the fundamental question of how cells coordinate growth with metabolism under non-ideal conditions. We identified vast changes in gene expression that implicated altered regulatory mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism correlating with decouple growth and metabolism. Our work highlights the complexity of engineering new cellular functions and that global regulatory modifications, rather than altering individual pathways, may be required for broad cellular changes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma (PDAC), the most frequent pancreatic cancer, is a deadly cancer since often diagnosed late and resistant to current therapies. A high proportion of PDAC patients are affected by cachexia induced by the tumor. This cachexia, characterized by loss of muscle mass and strength, contributes to patient frailty and poor therapeutic response. We showed that mitochondrial metabolism is reprogrammed in PDAC tumors and constitutes a vulnerability, opening novel therapeutic avenues. The objective of the present work was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial remodeling in PDAC cachectic skeletal muscle.\n\nMethodsOur study focused on the gastrocnemius muscle of genetically-engineered mice developing spontaneously a PDAC associated with cachexia (KIC GEMM). We compared KIC mice developing a pancreatic tumor in 9-10 weeks to control littermates. We did an integrative study combining in vivo functional analyses by non-invasive Magnetic Resonance, and ex-vivo histology, Seahorse, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic mass spectrometry and western blotting analyses.\n\nResultsThe cachectic KIC PDAC mice show a severe sarcopenia with loss of muscle mass and strength associated with reduced muscle fibers size and induction of protein degradation processes. Mitochondria in PDAC atrophic muscles show decreased respiratory capacities and structural alterations, associated with deregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dynamics pathways at the molecular level. Increased expression of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) defense genes suggests oxidative stress prone to affect mitochondrial macromolecules and homeostasis. Interestingly, multiple genes and proteins involved in DNA metabolism pathways, such as DNA damage, degradation of DNA, nucleotide synthesis, and folate pathway were found altered in sarcopenic mitochondria. While the number of mitochondria was not changed per cell, the mitochondrial mass was decreased by a factor of 2 and the mitochondrial DNA by a factor of 3, suggesting a defect in mitochondrial genome homeostasis.\n\nConclusionsWe unveiled that mitochondrial alterations in skeletal muscle play a central role in PDAC-induced cachexia. Muscle atrophy is associated with strong mitochondrial metabolic defects that are not limited to carbohydrates and protein, but concern also lipids, ROS and nucleic acids. Our data provide a reference framework to guide towards the most relevant molecular markers that would be affected at the start of tumor development and could be targets in the clinic to limit PDAC- induced cachexia at early stages of the pathology.",

    "abstract": "Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells metabolize glucose to organism-specific byproducts instead of fully oxidizing it to carbon dioxide and water-a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg Effect. The benefit to a cell has been unclear, given that partial metabolism of glucose yields an order of magnitude less ATP per molecule of glucose than complete oxidation. We show that glycolysis produces ATP faster per gram of pathway protein than respiration in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and mammalian cells. A simple mathematical model that uses yield, rate, and proteome occupancy of glycolysis and respiration as the only parameters accurately predicts absolute rates of glycolysis and respiration in all three organisms under diverse conditions. Our study suggests that the Warburg Effect is a consequence of the optimization of the rate of energy generation under the constraint of finite proteome space.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe Warburg Effect is a manifestation by which cells across kingdoms of life optimize the rate of energy production.",
