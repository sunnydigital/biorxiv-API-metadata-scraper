    "abstract": "Recent large datasets measuring the gene expression of millions of possible gene promoter sequences provide a resource to design and train optimised deep neural network architectures to predict expression from sequences. High predictive performance due to the modelling of dependencies within and between regulatory sequences is an enabler for biological discoveries in gene regulation through model interpretation techniques.\n\nTo understand the regulatory code that delineates gene expression, we have designed a novel deep-learning model (CRMnet) to predict gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our model outperforms the current benchmark models and achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.971. Interpretation of informative genomic regions determined from model saliency maps, and overlapping the saliency maps with known yeast motifs, support that our model can successfully locate the binding sites of transcription factors that actively modulate gene expression. We compare our models training times on a large compute cluster with GPUs and Google TPUs to indicate practical training times on similar datasets.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAdvances in sequencing technologies have led to a surge in genomic data, although the functions of many gene products coded by these genes remain unknown. While in-depth, targeted experiments that determine the functions of these gene products are crucial and routinely performed, they fail to keep up with the inflow of novel genomic data. In an attempt to address this gap, high-throughput experiments are being conducted in which a large number of genes are investigated in a single study. The annotations generated as a result of these experiments are generally biased towards a small subset of less informative Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Identifying and removing biases from protein function annotation databases is important since biases impact our understanding of protein function by providing a poor picture of the annotation landscape. Additionally, as machine learning methods for predicting protein function are becoming increasingly prevalent, it is essential that they are trained on unbiased datasets. Therefore, it is not only crucial to be aware of biases, but also to judiciously remove them from annotation datasets.\n\nResultsWe introduce GOThresher, a Python tool that identifies and removes biases in function annotations from protein function annotation databases.\n\nImplementation and AvailabilityGOThresher is written in Python and released via PyPI https://pypi.org/project/gothresher/ and on the Bioconda Anaconda channel https://anaconda.org/bioconda/gothresher.

    "abstract": "Many clinically used drugs are derived from or inspired by bacterial natural products that often are biosynthesised via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), giant megasynthases that activate and join individual amino acids in an assembly line fashion. Since NRPS are not limited to the incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation would allow the biotechnological generation of complex peptides including linear, cyclic and further modified natural product analogues, e.g. to optimise natural product leads. Here we describe a detailed phylogenetic analysis of several bacterial NRPS that led to the identification of a new recombination breakpoint within the thiolation (T) domain that is important for natural NRPS evolution. From this, an evolution-inspired eXchange Unit between T domains (XUT) approach was developed which allows the assembly of NRPS fragments over a broad range of GC contents, protein similarities, and extender unit specificities, as demonstrated for the specific production of a proteasome inhibitor designed and assembled from five different NRPS fragments.",

Recent advances in diagnostic and molecular tools enabled better identification and detection of these emerging pathogenic yeasts. Several of these emerging species belong to the Candida haemulonii species complex, which attracted much attention due to the rapid global emergence of its multi-drug resistant member Candida auris. Here, we describe a new clinically relevant yeast isolated from geographically distinct regions, representing the proposed novel species Candida khanbhai, member of the C. haemulonii species complex. Moreover, several members of the C. haemulonii species complex were observed to be invalidly described, including Candida auris and Candida vulturna.

    "abstract": "Selective attention1 is characterized by alternating states associated with either attentional sampling or attentional shifting, helping to avoid functional conflicts by isolating function-specific neural activity in time2-5. We hypothesized that such rhythmic temporal coordination might also help to avoid representational conflicts during working memory6. Multiple items can be simultaneously held in working memory, and these items can be represented by overlapping neural populations7-9. Traditional theories propose that short-term storage of to-be-remembered items occurs through persistent neural activity10-12, but when neurons are simultaneously representing multiple items, persistent activity creates a potential for representational conflicts. In comparison, more recent,  activity-silent theories of working memory propose that synaptic changes also contribute to the short-term storage of to-be-remembered items13-16. Transient bursts in neural activity17, rather than persistent activity, could serve to occasionally refresh these synaptic changes. Here, we used EEG and response times (RTs) to test whether rhythmic temporal coordination helps to isolate neural activity associated with different to-be-remembered items, which would help to avoid representational conflicts. Consistent with this hypothesis, we report that the relative strength of different item representations alternates over time as a function of frequency-specific phase. Although RTs were linked to theta (~6Hz) and beta (~25 Hz) phase during a memory delay, the relative strength of item representations only alternated as a function of beta phase. The present findings (i) are consistent with rhythmic temporal coordination being a general mechanism for avoiding either functional or representational conflicts during cognitive processes, and (ii) inform models describing the role of oscillatory dynamics in organizing working memory13,18-21.",

    "abstract": "The brain is composed of disparate neural populations that communicate and interact with one another. Although fiber bundles, similarities in molecular architecture, and synchronized neural activity all represent brain connectivity, a comprehensive study of how all these connectivity modes jointly reflect brain structure and function remains missing. Here we systematically integrate seven multimodal, multiscale brain connectivity profiles derived from gene expression, neurotransmitter receptor density, cellular morphology, glucose metabolism, haemodynamic activity, and electrophysiology. We uncover a compact set of universal organizational principles through which brain geometry and neuroanatomy shape emergent connectivity modes. Connectivity modes also exhibit unique and diverse connection patterns, hub profiles, dominant gradients, and modular organization. Throughout, we observe a consistent primacy of molecular connectivity modes--namely correlated gene expression and receptor similarity--that map well onto multiple phenomena including the rich club and patterns of cortical abnormalities across 13 neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Finally, we fuse all seven connectivity modes into a single multimodal network and show that it maps onto major organizational features of the brain including structural conenctivity, intrinsic functional networks, and cytoarchitectonic classes. Altogether, this work contributes to next-generation connectomics and the integrative study of inter-regional relationships.",

    "abstract": "Late in neural development, the expression of growth/differentiation factor (GDF) 15 increases in the germinal epithelium of the murine ganglionic eminence (GE), especially in progenitors with characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, the function of GDF15 in this region is still unknown. We here show that apical progenitors in the E18 GE also express the GDF15 receptor and that ablation of GDF15 promotes proliferation and cell cycle progression of apically and subapically dividing progenitors. A similar phenotype was also observed in the adult ventricular subventricular zone (V-SVZ). At both ages, increased proliferation leads to the transient generation of more neuronal progenitors, which is compensated by cell death, and to a permanent increase in the number of ependymal cells and apical NSCs. We also found that GDF15 receptor-expressing cells display immunoreactivity for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is also involved in progenitor proliferation, and that manipulation of GDF15 affects the expression of EGFR in mutant progenitors. Moreover, our data indicate that EGFR signalling in WT and mutant progenitors relies on distinct transduction modes. However, only exposure to exogenous GDF15, but not to EGF, normalized proliferation and the number of apical progenitors, indicating that alteration in EGFR signalling is not the main mechanism by which GDF15 affects proliferation in the embryonic GE.\n\nTaken together, GDF15 directly regulates proliferation of apical progenitors in the developing GE, thereby affecting the number of total ependymal cells and NSCs in this region.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has ushered in a resurgence of studies highlighting the importance of introgression throughout the Tree of Life. Several methods exist for detecting and quantifying introgression on a genomic scale, yet the majority of these methods primarily utilize signals of derived allele sharing between donor and recipient populations. In this study, we exploit the fact that introgression will not only result in derived allele sharing but also the reintroduction of ancestral alleles to derive new estimators of the admixture proportion. Using coalescent simulations, we assess the performance of our new methods and the methods proposed in Lopez Fang et al. 2022 to assess the utility of incorporating shared ancestral variation into genome-wide inferences of introgression. Using coalescent theory, simulations, and applying our methods to human and canid data, we find that methods incorporating ancestral allele sharing are comparable to their derived allele sharing counterparts, in turn providing researchers with the opportunity to utilize more of the genomic signature of introgression.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genomic loci associated with complex traits. Genetic fine-mapping aims to detect independent causal variants from the GWAS-identified loci, adjusting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. The use of GWAS summary statistics and an adequate LD reference enable large sample sizes for fine-mapping, without direct access to individual-level data. We present FiniMOM (fine-mapping using a product inverse-moment priors), a novel Bayesian fine-mapping method for summarized genetic associations. For causal effects, the method uses a non-local inverse-moment prior, which is a natural prior distribution to model non-null effects in finite samples. A beta-binomial prior is set for the number of causal variants, with a parameterization that can be used to control for potential misspecifications in the LD reference. We test the performance of our method against a current state-of-the-art fine-mapping method SuSiE (sum-of-single-effects) across a range of simulated scenarios aimed to mimic a typical GWAS on circulating protein levels, and an applied example. The results show improved credible set coverage and power of the proposed method, especially in the case of multiple causal variants within a locus. The superior performance and the flexible parameterization to control for misspecified LD reference make FiniMOM a competitive alternative to other fine-mapping methods for summarized genetic data.",

Native DNA was sequenced on a MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing device to generate genome assemblies for 7 major chrY human haplogroups. We analyzed and compared the chrY enrichment of sequencing data obtained using two different selective sequencing approaches: adaptive sampling and flow cytometry chromosome sorting. We show that adaptive sampling can produce data to create assemblies comparable to chromosome sorting while being a less expensive and time-consuming technique. We also assessed haplogroup-specific structural variants, which would be otherwise difficult to study using short-read sequencing data only. Finally, we took advantage of this technology to detect and profile epigenetic modifications amongst the considered haplogroups. Altogether, we provide a framework to study complex genomic regions with a simple, fast, and affordable methodology that could be applied to larger population genomics datasets.",
