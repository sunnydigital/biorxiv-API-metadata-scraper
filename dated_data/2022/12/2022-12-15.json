    "abstract": "The Insula is a multisensory relay that participates in socio-emotional processing through multiple projections to sensory, cognitive, emotional, and motivational regions. Interestingly, the Insula interhemispheric projection to the contralateral Insula is a strong but understudied projection. Using cutting-edge neuroanatomy, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology associated with specific circuit manipulation, we unraveled the nature and role of Insula interhemispheric communication in social and anxiety processing in mice. In this study, we 1) characterized the anatomical and molecular profile of the interhemispheric neurons of the Insula, 2) highlighted that stimulation of this neuronal subpopulation triggers excitation in the Insula interhemispheric circuit 3) uncovered their engagement in social processing. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that interhemispheric neurons of the Insula constitute a unique class of Insula neurons and proposes new meaningful insights into the neuronal mechanisms underlying social behavior.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are the greatest genetic risk factor for Parkinsons disease (PD). Communication between gut and brain and immune dysregulation are increasingly being implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Here, we show that flies lacking the Gba1b gene, the main fly orthologue of GBA1, display widespread innate immune up-regulation, including gut inflammation and brain glial activation. We also demonstrate gut dysfunction in flies lacking Gba1b, with increased intestinal transit time, gut barrier permeability and microbiome dysbiosis. Remarkably, modulating the microbiome of Gba1b knockout flies, by raising them under germ-free conditions, can partially ameliorate lifespan, locomotor and some neuropathological phenotypes. Lastly, direct stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin treatment achieves similar beneficial effects. Overall, our data reveal that the gut microbiome drives systemic immune activation in Gba1b knockout flies and that reducing innate immune response activation either by eliminating the microbiota or clearance of immunogens by autophagy may represent potential therapeutic avenues for GBA1-associated neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of how information unfolds when we recall events from memory remains limited. In this study, we investigate whether the reconstruction of visual object memories follows a backward trajectory along the ventral visual stream with respect to perception, such that their neural feature representations are gradually reinstated from late areas close to the hippocampus backwards to lower-level sensory areas. We use multivariate analyses of fMRI activation patterns to map the constituent features of the object memories onto the brain during retrieval, and EEG-fMRI fusion to track the temporal evolution of the reactivated patterns. Participants studied new associations between verbs and randomly paired object images in an encoding phase, and subsequently recalled the objects when presented with the corresponding verb cue. Decoding reactivated memory features from fMRI activity revealed that retrieval patterns were dominated by conceptual features, represented in comparatively late visual and parietal areas. Representational-similarity-based fusion then allowed us to map the EEG patterns that emerged at each given time point of a trial onto the spatially resolved fMRI patterns. This fusion suggests that memory reconstruction proceeds backwards along the ventral visual stream from anterior fronto-temporal to posterior occipital and parietal regions, in line with a semantic-to-perceptual gradient. A linear regression on the peak time points of reactivated brain regions statistically confirms that the temporal progression is reversed with respect to encoding. Together, the results shed light onto the spatio-temporal trajectories along which memories are reconstructed during associative retrieval, and which features of an image are reconstructed when in time and where in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a part of the medullary reticular formation, plays a major role in several physiological responses, including cardiovascular and sympathetic nervous system functions. Although aging causes disturbances in the responses of these physiological systems, RVLM involvement in these age-related changes is not clear. Previous work using high-throughput gene expression analysis of the RVLM in aged animals suggested that chemical neurotransmission-related genes might be downregulated with advancing age. Since RVLM function involves a balance of signals from inhibitory and excitatory inputs, which is largely mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmission, we hypothesized that aging is associated with altered excitatory and/or inhibitory neurotransmission-related gene expression in the RVLM. To test this hypothesis, we micropunched an RVLM-containing area from young (3-5 months), middle-aged (12-14 months), and aged (22- 26 months) Fischer 344 male rats. RNA purified from these micropunches was analyzed using GABA and Glutamate RT2 Profiler PCR arrays (n= 8-10). Each profiler array has primers for 84 GABA and glutamate neurotransmission related genes. In addition, the expression of selected genes was validated at the RNA level using TaqMan(R) based-qPCR and at the protein level using western blotting. All the genes that displayed significant differential expression (1.5-fold, p < .05, FDR < .05) were identified to be downregulated in the RVLM of aged and middle-aged rats compared to young rats. This downregulation did not appear to be a result of RVLM tissue sampling differences among the age groups, since a separate validation of our sampling method, which involved careful mapping of micropunched regions to a standardized brain atlas, revealed no spatial differences in sampled sites among age groups. Among the downregulated genes, the percentage of glutamate neurotransmission-related genes was higher than GABA neurotransmission-related genes. The Solute carrier family 1 member 6 (Slc1a6) gene showed the highest fold downregulation at the RNA level in the RVLM of aged compared to young rats, and its protein product, Excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4), showed a downregulatory trend in the RVLM of aged and middle-aged rats. These results suggest that molecular constituents of both GABA and glutamate neurotransmission might be altered in the RVLM of aged and middle-aged rats, and the changes in glutamate neurotransmission might be more prominent. Investigating age-associated anatomical and functional changes in RVLM GABA and glutamate neurotransmission might provide a foundation for understanding the effects of aging on physiological function.",

    "abstract": "The neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis impacts the lives of over 700 million people globally. Schistosoma mansoni, the trematode parasite that causes the most common type of schistosomiasis, requires planorbid pond snails of the genus Biomphalaria to support its larval development and transformation to the form that can infect humans. A greater understanding of neural signaling systems that are specific to the Biomphalaria intermediate host could lead to novel strategies for parasite or snail control. This study characterized a Biomphalaria glabrata neural receptor that is gated by the molluscan neuropeptide FMRF-NH2. The Biomphalaria glabrata FMRF-NH2 gated sodium channel (Bgl-FaNaC) amino acid sequence was highly conserved with FaNaCs found in related gastropods, especially the planorbid Planorbella trivolvis (91% sequence identity). In common with the P. trivolvis FaNaC, the B. glabrata receptor exhibited a low affinity (EC50: 3 x 10-4 M) and high specificity for the FMRF-NH2 agonist. Its expression in the central nervous system, detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, was widespread, with the protein localized mainly to neuronal fibers and the mRNA confined to cell bodies. Colocalization was observed with the FMRF-NH2 tetrapeptide precursor in some neurons associated with male mating behavior. At the mRNA level, Bgl-FaNaC expression in the visceral and left parietal ganglia decreased at 20 days post infection by S. mansoni and in the shedding phase. Altered FMRF-NH2 signaling could be vital for parasite survival and proliferation in its snail intermediate host.",

    "abstract": "The temporal structure of sensory inputs contains essential information for their interpretation by the brain1-9. Sensory systems represent these temporal cues through two codes: the temporal sequences of neuronal activity and the spatial patterns of neuronal firing rate3,7,10-20. However, it is still unknown which of these two coexisting codes causally drives sensory decisions3,10,20,21. To separate their contributions, we designed an optogenetic stimulation paradigm in the mouse auditory cortex to generate neuronal activity patterns differing exclusively along their temporal or spatial dimensions. Training mice to discriminate these patterns shows that they efficiently learn to discriminate spatial but not temporal patterns, indicating that spatial representations are necessary for sensory learning. In line with this result, we observed, based on large-scale neuronal recordings of the auditory system, that the auditory cortex is the first region in which spatial patterns efficiently represent temporal auditory cues varying over several hundred milliseconds. This feature is shared by the deep layers of neural networks trained to categorise time-varying sounds. Therefore, the emergence of a spatial code for temporal sensory cues is a necessary condition to associate temporally structured stimuli to decisions. We expect this constraint to be crucial for re-engineering perception by cortical stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Initiating drug use during adolescence increases the risk of developing addiction and psychiatric disorders later in life, with long-term outcomes varying according to sex and exact timing of use. Even though most individuals begin experimenting with drugs of abuse in adolescence, to date, the cellular and molecular underpinnings explaining differential sensitivity to detrimental drug effects remain unknown. The Netrin-1/DCC guidance cue system plays a critical role in the adolescent development of mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuitry, segregating the cortical and limbic pathways. Adolescent experiences, including exposure to drugs of abuse, can regulate Dcc expression in male mice, placing Netrin-1/DCC signaling as a potential molecular link between experience and enduring changes to circuitry and behavior. Here we show that exposure to a recreational-like regimen of amphetamine (AMPH) in adolescence induces sex- and age-specific alterations in Dcc expression in the ventral tegmental area. Female mice are protected against the deleterious long-term effects of AMPH-induced Dcc regulation by compensatory changes in the expression of its binding partner, Netrin-1. AMPH induces targeting errors in mesolimbic dopamine axons and triggers their ectopic growth to the prefrontal cortex, only in early-adolescent male mice, underlying a male-specific vulnerability to its enduring cognitive effects. Upregulating DCC receptor expression in dopamine neurons in adolescent males using a neuron-optimized CRISPR/dCas9 Activation System induces female-like protection against the persistent effects of AMPH in early adolescence on inhibitory control. Netrin-1/DCC signaling is therefore a molecular switch which can be differentially regulated in response to the same experience as function of age and sex of the individual, leading to divergent long-term outcomes associated with vulnerable or resilient phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain are primarily quiescent but can activate and enter the cell cycle to produce newborn neurons. NSC quiescence can be regulated by disease, injury, and age, however our understanding of NSC quiescence is limited by technical limitations imposed by the bias of markers used to isolate each population of NSCs and the lack of live-cell labeling strategies. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of autofluorescent metabolic cofactors has previously been used in other cell types to study shifts in cell states driven by metabolic remodeling that change the optical properties of these endogenous fluorophores. Here we asked whether autofluorescence could be used to discriminate NSC activation state. We found that quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) and activated NSCs (aNSCs) each have unique autofluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime profiles. Additionally, qNSCs specifically display an enrichment of a specific autofluorescent signal localizing to lysosomes that is highly predictive of cell state. These signals can be used as a graded marker of NSC quiescence to predict cell behavior and track the dynamics of quiescence exit at single cell resolution in vitro and in vivo. Through coupling autofluorescence imaging with single-cell RNA sequencing in vitro and in vivo, we provide a high-resolution resource revealing transcriptional features linked to rapid NSC activation and deep quiescence. Taken together, we describe a single-cell resolution, non-destructive, live-cell, label-free strategy for measuring NSC activation state in vitro and in vivo and use this tool to expand our understanding of adult neurogenesis.",

Here we quantify patterns of structure-function coupling across the neocortex, by comparing structural connectivity estimated using diffusion MRI with functional connectivity estimated using both neurophysiological (MEG-based) and haemodynamic (fMRI-based) recordings. We find that structure-function coupling is heterogeneous across brain regions and frequency bands. The link between structural and functional connectivity is generally stronger in multiple MEG frequency bands compared to resting state fMRI. Structure-function coupling is greater in slower and intermediate frequency bands compared to faster frequency bands. We also find that structure-function coupling systematically follows the archetypal sensorimotor-association hierarchy, as well as patterns of laminar differentiation, peaking in granular layer IV. Finally, structure-function coupling is better explained using structure-informed inter-regional communication metrics than using structural connectivity alone. Collectively, these results place neurophysiological and haemodynamic structure-function relationships in a common frame of reference and provide a starting point for a multi-modal understanding of structure-function coupling in the brain.",

Multi-modal connectome studies have revealed many important findings underlying the adult brain but related studies were rare in the early human brain. One potential challenge is the lack of an appropriate and unbiased parcellation that combines structural and functional information in this population. Using 348 multi-modal MRI datasets from the developing human connectome project, we found that the information fused from the structural, diffusion, and functional MRI was relatively stable across MRI features and showed high reproducibility at the group level. Therefore, we generated automated multi-resolution parcellations (300 - 500 parcels) based on the similarity across multi-modal features using a gradient-based parcellation algorithm. In addition, to acquire a parcellation with high interpretability, we provided a manually delineated parcellation (210 parcels), which was approximately symmetric, and the adjacent areas around each boundary were statistically different in terms of the integrated similarity metric and at least one kind of original features. Overall, the present study provided multi-resolution and neonate-specific parcellations of the cerebral cortex based on multi-modal MRI properties, which may facilitate future studies of the human connectome in the early development period.",

    "abstract": "A stroke is a brain insult that can take offline (often permanently) extended regions of the brain. As a consequence, cognitive tasks or representations implemented by the affected circuitry lose their computational substrate (they become orphan). The brain must adapt to attempt retaining such functions. The existing clinical literature offers a complex picture, often with conflicting observations, about how the brain gets reorganized after stroke. It also does little use of the few mathematical works on the topic. Can a minimal mathematical model of cortical plasticity shed light on this complex phenomenology? Here we explore such minimal model, and find a specific phenomenology: a lasting perilesional reorganization for small injuries, and a temporary contralesional reorganization for large injuries that is not always reverted to ipsilesional. We furthermore show the mechanisms behind these dynamics in our model: a second order phase transition with a critical point, as well as a delayed engagement of perilesional reorganization in large injuries. These dynamics emerge out of a fairly minimal modeling of plasticity, and they reproduce the story put together from clinical observations. We further explore neurorehabilitation strategies, and argue that increased tissue susceptibility (a property that diverges at critical points) can be crucial to manipulate plasticity in beneficial ways.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing (HTS) and sequence mining tools revolutionized virus detection and discovery in recent years and implementing them with classical plant virology techniques results to a powerful approach to characterize viruses. An example of a virus discovered through HTS is Solanum nigrum ilarvirus 1 (SnIV1) (family Bromoviridae), which was recently reported in various solanaceous plants from France, Slovenia, Greece, and South Africa. It was likewise detected in grapevines (Vitaceae) and several Fabaceae and Rosaceae plant species. Such a very diverse host association is atypical for ilarviruses, thus warranted further investigation. In this study, modern and classical virological tools were combined to accelerate the characterization of SnIV1. Through HTS-based virome surveys, mining of sequence read archive datasets, and literature search, SnIV1 was further identified from diverse plant and non-plant sources globally. SnIV1 isolates showed relatively low variability compared to other phylogenetically related ilarviruses. Phylogenetic analyses showed a distinct basal clade of isolates from Europe, while the rest formed clades of mixed geographic origin. Furthermore, systemic infection of SnIV1 in Solanum villosum and its mechanical and graft transmissibility to solanaceous species were demonstrated. Near identical SnIV1 genomes from the inoculum (S. villosum) and inoculated Nicotiana benthamiana were sequenced, thus partially fulfilling Kochs postulates. SnIV1 was shown to be seed-transmitted and potentially pollen-borne, has spherical virions, and possibly induces histopathological changes in infected N. benthamiana leaf tissues. Overall, this study provided information to better understand the diversity, distribution, and pathobiology of SnIV1, but whether it could emerge as a destructive pathogen remains uncertain.\n\nFundingO_LIEU Horizon 2020 Marie Skodowska-Curie Actions Innovative Training Network (H2020 MSCA-ITN) project no.

Screening an array of purified fibers led us o appreciate that, of all fibers tested, psyllium was unique in that it strongly protected mice against both colitis and metabolic syndrome. Further investigation led us to appreciate that psylliums mechanism of action is quite distinct. Specifically, data we report in a manuscript under review indicates that low doses of psyllium protect mice against colitis via increasing serum bile acids that activate FXR. Here, we report that higher doses of psyllium protect mice against diet-induced obesity/metabolic syndrome by a FXR-independent mechanism that requires presence of at least a minimal microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Single amino acid changes in the parasite protein Kelch13 (K13) result in reduced susceptibility of P. falciparum parasites to artemisinin and its derivatives (ART). Recent work indicated that K13 and other proteins co-localising with K13 (K13 compartment proteins) are involved in the endocytic uptake of host cell cytosol (HCCU) and that a reduction in HCCU results in ART resistance. HCCU is critical for parasite survival but is poorly understood, with the K13 compartment proteins among the few proteins so far functionally linked to this process. Here we further defined the composition of the K13 compartment by analysing more hits from a previous BioID, showing that MyoF and MCA2 as well as Kelch13 interaction candidate (KIC) 11 and 12 are found at this site. Functional analyses, tests for ART susceptibility as well as comparisons of structural similarities using AlphaFold2 predictions of these and previously identified proteins showed that canonical vesicle trafficking and endocytosis domains were frequent in proteins involved in resistance or endocytosis (or both), comprising one group of K13 compartment proteins. While this strengthened the link of the K13 compartment to endocytosis, many proteins of this group showed unusual domain combinations and large parasite-specific regions, indicating a high level of taxon-specific adaptation of this process. Another group of K13 compartment proteins did not influence endocytosis or ART susceptibility and lacked detectable vesicle trafficking domains. We here identified the first protein of this group that is important for asexual blood stage development and showed that it likely is involved in invasion. Overall, this work identified novel proteins functioning in endocytosis and at the K13 compartment. Together with comparisons of structural predictions it provides a repertoire of functional domains at the K13 compartment that indicate a high level of adaption of endocytosis in malaria parasites.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal shedding of winter hair at the start of summer is well studied in wild and domesticated populations. However, the genetic influences on this trait and their interactions are poorly understood. We use data from 13,364 cattle with 36,899 repeated phenotypes to investigate the relationship between hair shedding and environmental variables, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and their interactions to understand quantitative differences in seasonal shedding. Using deregressed estimated breeding values from a repeated records model in a genome-wide association analysis (GWAA) and meta-analysis of year-specific GWAA gave remarkably similar results.\n\nThese GWAA identified hundreds of variants associated with seasonal hair shedding. There were especially strong associations on chromosomes 5 and 23. Genotype-by- environment interaction GWAA identified 1,040 day length-by-genotype interaction associations and 17 apparent temperature-by-genotype interaction associations with hair shedding, highlighting the importance of day length on hair shedding. Accurate genomic predictions of hair shedding were created for the entire dataset, Angus, Hereford, Brangus, and multi-breed datasets. Loci related to metabolism and light- sensing have a large influence on seasonal hair shedding. This is one of the largest genetic analyses of a phenological trait and provides insight for both agriculture production and basic science.",

    "abstract": "Preparatory control in task-switching has been suggested to rely upon a set of distributed regions within a frontoparietal network, with frontal and parietal cortical areas cooperating to implement switch-specific preparation processes. Although recent causal evidences using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have generally supported this model, alternative evidences from both functional neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have questioned the switch-specific role of both frontal and parietal cortices. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of prefrontal and parietal areas supporting preparatory cognitive control in task-switching. Within this purpose, an fMRI study during task-switching performance was conducted to identify the specific brain areas involved in preparatory control during performance of a task-switching paradigm. Then, TMS was applied over the specific coordinates previously identified through fMRI, that is, the anterior portion of the inferior frontal junction (aIFJ) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Results revealed that TMS over the aIFJ disrupted performance in both switch and repeat trails in terms of delayed responses as compared to Sham condition. In contrast, TMS over the IPS selectively interfered performance in switch trials. These findings support a multicomponent model of executive control with the aIFJ being involved in more general switch-unspecific process such as the episodic retrieval of goals, and the IPS being related to the implementation of switch-specific preparation mechanisms for activating stimulus-response mappings. The results help conciliating preceding evidences about the role of a frontoparietal network during task-switching, and support current models about a hierarchical organization within prefrontal cortex.\n\nSignificance StatementA combined fMRI and TMS study was conducted to clarify the brain areas involved in the executive control of attention during a cueing task-switching paradigm.\n\nFunctional dissociations were observed during TMS stimulation, with prefrontal and parietal areas playing different roles during task-switching preparation. While the anterior portion of the inferior prefrontal junction seemed to be involved in a general mechanism of memory retrieval for goal identification, the intraparietal sulcus seemed to be engaged in a switch-specific mechanism for the translation of abstract task goals into action rules.\n\nThe results help conciliating preceding evidences about the role of a frontoparietal network during task-switching, and support current models about a hierarchical organization within prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to neuropathology in infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease. With the exception of microglia, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are virtually undetectable in the mature, healthy central nervous system (CNS). Neurons have generally been considered incapable of antigen presentation, and although interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) can elicit neuronal MHC class I (MHC-I) expression and antigen presentation in vitro, it remains unclear whether similar responses occur in vivo. Here we directly injected IFN-{gamma} into the ventral midbrain of mature mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of specific CNS cell types. We find that IFN-{gamma} induces cellular proliferation and expression of MHC-II and associated genes only in microglia. However, IFN-{gamma} upregulated MHC-I and associated mRNAs in ventral midbrain microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. The core set of IFN-{gamma}-induced genes and their response kinetics were conserved across neurons and glia, with a lower amplitude of expression in neurons. A diverse repertoire of genes was upregulated in glia, particularly microglia, while no neuron-specific responses to IFN-{gamma} were observed. Using mutant mice to selectively delete the IFN-{gamma}-binding domain of IFNGR1 in dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that dopaminergic neurons respond directly to IFN-{gamma}. Our results suggest that most neurons are capable of responding directly to IFN-{gamma} and upregulating MHC-I and related genes in vivo, but their expression amplitude and repertoire is limited compared to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia.\n\nOne-sentence summaryWe find that IFN-{gamma} induces transcription of MHC class I antigen processing and presentation machinery in all major parenchymal cell types in the ventral midbrain; however, neuronal responses are low amplitude and limited to a small set of genes, MHC class II expression and cellular proliferation are restricted to microglia, and dopamine neuronal responses require cell autonomous expression of IFNGR1.",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by involuntary fluctuations of attention in continuous performance tasks (CPTs) wherein attention must be sustained over long periods of time. The neuronal basis underlying aberrant attentional fluctuations in time scales from seconds to minutes have remained poorly understood. Neuronal alpha- and gammaband oscillations are thought to implement attentional and top-down control of sensorimotor processing. We hypothesized that aberrant behavioral fluctuations in ADHD would be caused by aberrant endogenous brain dynamics in alpha and gamma-band oscillations and specifically by their aberrant long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). We measured brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) from adult participants diagnosed with ADHD (N = 19) and from healthy control subjects (N = 20) during resting state and two CPTs; a threshold stimulus detection task and a Go/NoGo task. We then estimated LRTCs of neuronal oscillations and behavioral fluctuations with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). ADHD was associated with aberrant LRTCs in both behavioral performance and of neuronal oscillations. LRTCs were correlated with symptom severity with a U-shaped correlations indicating that the LRTCs were largest with moderate symptom scores. These data demonstrate the presence of aberrant temporal dynamics of neuronal oscillations in adult ADHD patients, which may underlie involuntary attentional fluctuations in ADHD. Taken that LRTCs are a hallmark of brain critical dynamics, these data show that moderate ADHD symptoms scores maximize brain criticality which is thought to be beneficial for performance.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of aggregates of the microtubule associated protein tau, a main component of neurofibrillary tangles. Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of tauopathy and dementia, with amyloid-beta pathology as an additional hallmark feature of the disease. Besides the role of tau in stabilizing microtubules, it is localized at postsynaptic sites and can disrupt synaptic plasticity when knocked out or overexpressed. The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), is an immediate early gene that plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Arc has been implicated in AD pathogenesis, where it was found to regulate activity-dependent release of amyloid-beta (A{beta}). Here we show that Arc protein is upregulated in the hippocampus of tau knockout (Tau KO) mice and in dendrites of Tau KO primary hippocampal neurons. Conversely, overexpression of tau decreased Arc stability exclusively in neuronal dendrites and was coupled to an increase in the expression of dendritic and somatic surface GluA1-containing -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. The Tau-dependent decrease in Arc was proteasome sensitive, yet independent of Arc ubiquitination and required the endophilin-binding domain of Arc, which is essential for promoting the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. Importantly, these effects on Arc stability and GluA1 localization were not observed in the commonly studied tau mutant, P301L. Our findings show a physiological role for tau in regulating Arc and implicate specific variants of tau in regulating Arc stability and AMPA receptor targeting, which may in part explain observed deficits in synaptic plasticity in select types of tauopathies.",

This 7T fMRI study addresses both questions using a continuous flash suppression paradigm with an emotional recognition task (fear vs neutral bodies) in combination with the perceptual awareness scale. Behaviorally, recognition sensitivity increased linearly with increased stimuli awareness and was at chance level during perceptual unawareness. Threat expressions triggered a slower heart rate than neutral ones during  almost clear experience of the stimulus, indicating freezing behavior. The activity in occipital, temporal, parietal and frontal regions as well as in amygdala increased with increased stimulus awareness while the activity in early visual areas showed the opposite pattern. The relationship between temporal area activity and perceptual awareness was better characterized by a gradual model while the activity in fronto-parietal areas by a dichotomous model, suggesting different roles in conscious processing. Interestingly, no evidence of non-conscious processing was found in amygdala as well as no significant effect of emotion, in disagreement with the functions long ascribed to this subcortical structure.",

We used tau filaments isolated from the brain of an individual with Alzheimers disease (AD), and from the brain of an individual with primary age-related tauopathy (PART) with a co-pathology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Unexpectedly, we were unable to visualise additional cryo-EM density for flortaucipir for AD paired helical or straight filaments (PHFs or SFs), but we did observe density for flortaucipir binding to CTE Type I filaments from the case with PART. In the latter, flortaucipir binds in a 1:1 molecular stoichiometry with tau, adjacent to lysine 353 and aspartate 358. By adopting a tilted geometry with respect to the helical axis, the 4.7 [A] distance between neighbouring tau monomers is reconciled with the 3.5 [A] distance consistent with {pi}-{pi}-stacking between neighbouring molecules of flortaucipir.",

    "abstract": "State variables, such as body condition, are important predictors of behavioural traits. Depending on the state of an individual, the costs and benefits associated with different behavioural decisions can vary. An individuals state could affect its average behavioural response and also the behavioural repeatability. Moreover, even for the same state, different behavioural strategies may be adaptive depending on the individuals life-stage. Here, we manipulated the body condition in larvae and adults of a holometabolous insect species, Athalia rosae, using starvation. We assessed the effects of starvation on the behavioural traits of post-contact immobility (PCI) and activity levels and tested their repeatability. Our results show state-dependency of behaviour, although the effect varied with life-stage. Starved larvae exhibited shorter PCI duration and higher activity levels, whereas starved adults were less active than non-starved individuals. Moreover, although most behavioural repeatability estimates were significant in both life-stages, we did not find any significant effect of starvation on the estimates. Next, we calculated standardised effect sizes to compare starvation effects across life stages. We found that starvation had a larger and opposite effect in the larval stage than during the adult stage for all behavioural traits. Finally, we conducted microcosm and no-choice bioassay experiments to examine the benefits and costs, respectively, of the behaviour elicited by starvation in the larval stage. We observed that starved larvae located food faster than non-starved larvae but were also attacked sooner by a predator, possibly due to their higher activity levels. Together, our results demonstrate that behavioural state-dependence is a function of the life-stage of an individual. Moreover, the behavioural strategy exhibited can be adaptive for a specific life-stage with respect to certain functions, like foraging, but also carry costs, like risk of predation.",

    "abstract": "The canonical DEAD-box helicase, eIF4A, unwinds 5 UTR secondary structures to promote mRNA translation initiation. Growing evidence has indicated that other helicases, such as DHX29 and DDX3/ded1p, also function to promote the scanning of the 40S subunit on highly structured mRNAs. It is unknown how the relative contributions of eIF4A and other helicases regulate duplex unwinding on an mRNA to promote initiation. Here, we have adapted a real-time fluorescent duplex unwinding assay to precisely monitor helicase activity in the 5 UTR of a reporter mRNA that can be translated in a cell-free extract in parallel. We monitored the rate of 5 UTR-dependent duplex unwinding in the absence or presence of Hippuristanol, a dominant negative eIF4A (eIF4A-R362Q), or a mutant eIF4E (eIF4E-W73L) that can bind the m7G cap but not eIF4G. Our experiments reveal that roughly 50% of the duplex unwinding activity in the cell-free extract can be attributed to an eIF4A-dependent mechanism, while the remaining 50% of duplex unwinding activity is attributed to an eIF4A-independent mechanism. Importantly, we show that the robust eIF4A-independent duplex unwinding is not sufficient for translation. We also show that the m7G cap structure, and not the poly(A) tail, is the primary mRNA modification responsible for promoting duplex unwinding in our cell-free extract system. Overall, the fluorescent duplex unwinding assay provides a precise method to investigate how eIF4A-dependent and eIF4A-independent helicase activity regulates translation initiation in cell-free extracts. We anticipate that potential small molecule inhibitors could be tested for helicase inhibition using this duplex unwinding assay.",

Converging evidence from human and rodent studies suggest that disrupted grid coding underlies path integration deficits in preclinical individuals. However, it still remains unclear if disrupted early AD grid coding reflects increased noise across the network or a specific deficit in path integration, perhaps via an impairment in the integration of self-motion cues. Here, we report in the J20 transgenic amyloid beta mouse model of early AD that grid cells were spatially unstable towards the center of the square arena but not near the borders, had qualitatively different spatial components that aligned parallel to the borders of the environment, and exhibited impaired integration of distance travelled via reduced theta phase precession. Our results suggest that disrupted early AD grid coding reflects reduced integration of self-motion cues but not environmental landmarks, providing further evidence that grid cell impairments underlie specific path integration deficits in early AD.",

    "abstract": "We lack a fundamental understanding of how the spike output of the retina enables human visual perception. Here we show that human vision at its ultimate sensitivity limit depends on the spike output of ON but not OFF parasol (magnocellular) ganglion cells. Surprisingly, nonlinear signal processing in the retinal ON pathway precludes perceptual detection of single photons in darkness, but enables quantal-resolution discrimination of differences in light intensity.",

    "abstract": "ASXL1 (Additional sex combs-like 1) plays key roles in epigenetic regulation of early developmental gene expression. De novo truncating mutations in ASXL1 cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS, OMIM #605039), a rare neurodevelopmental condition characterized by severe intellectual disabilities, characteristic facial features, hypertrichosis, increased risk of Wilms tumor, and variable congenital anomalies including heart defects and severe skeletal defects giving rise to a typical  BOS posture. These BOS-causing ASXL1 variants are also high-prevalence somatic driver mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We use primary cells from BOS individuals (n = 18) and controls (n = 49) to dissect gene regulatory changes caused by ASXL1 mutations using comprehensive multi-omics assays for chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), DNA methylation, histone methylation binding, and transcriptome in peripheral blood and skin fibroblasts. Our data shows that regardless of cell type, ASXL1 mutations drive strong cross-tissue effects that disrupt multiple layers of the epigenome. The data showed a broad activation of canonical Wnt signaling at the transcriptional and protein levels and upregulation of VANGL2, a planar cell polarity pathway protein that acts through non-canonical Wnt signaling to direct tissue patterning and cell migration. This multi-omics approach identifies the core impact of ASXL1 mutations and therapeutic targets for BOS and myeloid leukemias.\n\nBrief summaryGermline ASXL1 mutations that cause Bohring Optiz syndrome disrupt the epigenome and dysregulate gene expression resulting in activation of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the intricate relationships between transcription factors (TFs), enhancers, and genes through the inference of enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks is crucial in understanding gene regulatory programs in a complex biological system. This study introduces STREAM, a novel method that leverages a Steiner Forest Problem model, a hybrid biclustering pipeline, and submodular optimization to infer enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks from jointly profiled single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data. Compared to existing methods, STREAM demonstrates enhanced performance in terms of TF recovery, TF-enhancer relation prediction, and enhancer-gene discovery. Application of STREAM to an Alzheimers disease dataset and a diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma dataset reveals its ability to identify TF-enhancer-gene relationships associated with pseudotime, as well as key TF-enhancer-gene relationships and TF cooperation underlying tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "A behavioral strategy crucial to survival is directed navigation to a goal, such as a food or home location. One potential neural substrate for supporting goal-directed navigation is the parahippocampus, which contains neurons that represent an animals position, orientation, and movement through the world, and that change their firing activity to encode behaviorally relevant variables such as reward. However, little prior work on the parahippocampus has considered how neurons encode variables during goal-directed navigation in environments that dynamically change. Here, we recorded single units from rat parahippocampal cortex while subjects performed a goal-directed task. The maze dynamically changed goal-locations via a visual cue on a trial-to-trial basis, requiring subjects to use cue-location associations to receive reward. We observed a mismatch-like signal, with elevated neural activity on incorrect trials, leading to rate-remapping. The strength of this remapping correlated with task performance. Recordings during open-field foraging allowed us to functionally define navigational coding for a subset of the neurons recorded in the maze. This approach revealed that head-direction coding units remapped more than other functional-defined units. Taken together, this work thus raises the possibility that during goal-directed navigation, parahippocampal neurons encode error information reflective of an animals behavioral performance.",
