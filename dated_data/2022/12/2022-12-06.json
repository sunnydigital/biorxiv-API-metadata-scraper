    "abstract": "Many world fisheries display a declining mean trophic level of catches. This \"fishing down the food web\" is often attributed to reduced densities of high-trophic-level species. We show here that the fishing down pattern can actually emerge from the adaptive harvesting of two- and three-species food webs, where changes in fishing patterns are driven by the relative profitabilities of the harvested species. Shifting fishing patterns from a focus on higher trophic levels to a focus on lower trophic levels can yield abrupt changes in the system, strongly impacting species densities. In predator-prey systems, such regime shifts occur when the predator species is highly valuable relative to the prey, and when the top-down control on the prey is strong. Moreover, we find that when the two species are jointly harvested, high adaptation speeds can reduce the resilience of fisheries. Our results therefore suggest that flexibility in harvesting strategies will not necessarily benefit fisheries but may actually harm their sustainability.",

    "abstract": "The GeneMax (GMX) Advantage test, developed by Zoetis, uses approximately 50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to predict the genomic potential of a commercial Angus heifer. Genetic predictions are provided for Calving Ease Maternal, Weaning Weight, Heifer Pregnancy, Milk, Mature Weight, Dry Matter Intake, Carcass Weight, Marbling, Yield, and three economic selection indices. Test results can inform selection and culling decisions made by commercial beef cattle producers. To measure the accuracy of the trait predictions, data from commercial Angus females and their progeny at the University of Missouri Thompson Research Center were utilized to analyze weaning weight, milk, marbling, fat, ribeye area, and carcass weight. Progeny phenotypic data were matched to the respective dam, then the cows genomic predictions were compared to the calfs age-adjusted phenotypes using correlation and linear model effect sizes. All tested GeneMax scores of the dam were significantly correlated with and predicted calf performance. Our predicted effect sizes, except for fat thickness, were similar to those reported by Zoetis. In conclusion, the GeneMax Advantage test accurately ranks animals based on their genetic merit and is an effective selection tool in commercial cowherds.",

    "abstract": "While the pivotal role of linker histone H1 in shaping nucleosome organization is well established, its functional interplays with chromatin factors along the epigenome are just starting to emerge. Here we first report that in Arabidopsis, as in mammals, H1 occupies Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target genes where it favors chromatin condensation and H3K27me3 deposition. We further show that, contrasting with its conserved function in PRC2 activation at genes, H1 selectively prevents H3K27me3 accumulation at telomeres and large pericentromeric interstitial telomeric repeat (ITR) domains by restricting DNA accessibility to Telomere Repeat Binding (TRB) proteins, a group of H1-related Myb factors mediating PRC2 cis recruitment.

Imaging-based neuroanatomical tracing identifies area-to-area or sparse neuron-to-neuron connectivity patterns, but with limited throughput. Barcode-based connectomics maps large numbers of single-neuron projections, but remains a challenge for jointly analyzing single-cell transcriptomics. Here, we established a rAAV2-retro barcode-based multiplexed tracing method that simultaneously characterizes the projectome and transcriptome at the single neuron level. We uncovered dedicated and collateral projection patterns of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) neurons to five downstream targets and found that projection-defined vmPFC neurons are molecularly heterogeneous. We identified transcriptional signatures of projection-specific vmPFC neurons, and verified Pou3f1 as a marker gene of neurons extending collateral branches to dorsomedial striatum and lateral hypothalamus. In summary, we have developed a new multiplexed technique whose paired connectome and gene expression data can help reveal organizational principles that form neural circuits and process information.",

    "abstract": "Natural plant populations are polymorphic and show intraspecific variation in resistance properties against pathogens. The activation of the underlying defence responses can depend on variation in perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns or elicitors. To dissect such variation, we evaluated the responses induced by laminarin, (a glucan, representing an elicitor from oomycetes) in the wild tomato species Solanum chilense and correlated this to observed infection frequencies of Phytophthora infestans.\n\nWe measured reactive oxygen species burst and levels of diverse phytohormones upon elicitation in 83 plants originating from nine populations. We found high diversity in basal and elicitor-induced levels of each component. Further we generated linear models to explain the observed infection frequency of P. infestans. The effect of individual components differed dependent on the geographical origin of the plants. We found that the resistance in the southern coastal region, but not in the other regions is directly correlated to ethylene responses and confirmed this positive correlation using ethylene inhibition assays.\n\nOur findings reveal high diversity in the strength of defence responses within a species and the involvement of different components with a quantitatively different contribution of individual components to resistance in geographically separated populations of a wild plant species.\n\nHighlightLarge-scale screenings reveal geographically distinct intraspecific differences in the dominant physiological pathogen defence responses upon glucan elicitor treatment in a wild tomato species.",

    "abstract": "Time-lapse imaging is a powerful approach to gain insight into the dynamic responses of cells, but the quantitative analysis of morphological changes over time remains challenging. Here, we exploit the concept of \"trajectory embedding\" to analyze cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory histories--that is, multiple time points simultaneously, rather than the more common practice of examining morphological feature time courses in single timepoint (snapshot) morphological features. We apply this approach to analyze live-cell images of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells after treatment with a panel of microenvironmental perturbagens that strongly modulate cell motility, morphology, and cell cycle behavior. Our morphodynamical trajectory embedding analysis constructs a shared cell state landscape revealing ligand-specific regulation of cell state transitions and enables quantitative and descriptive models of single-cell trajectories. Additionally, we show that incorporation of trajectories into single-cell morphological analysis enables (i) systematic characterization of cell state trajectories, (ii) better separation of phenotypes, and (iii) more descriptive models of ligand-induced differences as compared to snapshot-based analysis. This morphodynamical trajectory embedding is broadly applicable to the quantitative analysis of cell responses via live-cell imaging across many biological and biomedical applications.",

Our strategy allows observation of near-continuous single-molecule fluorescence for more than an hour, a timescale two orders of magnitude longer than the typical photobleaching time of single fluorophores under our conditions. Using two orthogonal sequences, we show that our method is adaptable to Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and that can be used to study the conformational dynamics of dynamic structures, such as DNA Holliday junctions, for extended periods. By adjusting the temporal resolution and observation span, our approach should enable capturing the conformational dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids over a wide range of timescales.",

CellSpace captures meaningful latent structure in scATAC-seq datasets, including cell subpopulations and developmental hierarchies, and scores the activity of transcription factors in single cells based on proximity to binding motifs embedded in the same space. Importantly, CellSpace implicitly mitigates batch effects arising from multiple samples, donors, or assays, even when individual datasets are processed relative to different peak atlases.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial cristae expand the surface area of respiratory membranes and ultimately allow for the evolutionary scaling of respiration with cell volume across eukaryotes. The discovery of Mic60 homologs among alphaproteobacteria, the closest extant relatives of mitochondria, suggested that cristae might have evolved from bacterial intracytoplasmic membranes (ICMs). Here, we investigated the predicted structure and function of alphaproteobacterial Mic60, and a protein encoded by an adjacent gene Orf52, in two distantly related purple alphaproteobacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In addition, we assessed the potential physical interactors of Mic60 and Orf52 in R. sphaeroides. We show that the three -helices of mitochondrial Mic60s mitofilin domain, as well as its adjacent membrane-binding amphipathic helix, are present in alphaproteobacterial Mic60. The disruption of Mic60 and Orf52 caused photoheterotrophic growth defects, which are most severe under low light conditions, and both their disruption and overexpression led to enlarged ICMs in both studied alphaproteobacteria. We also found that alphaproteobacterial Mic60 physically interacts with BamA, the homolog of Sam50, one of the main physical interactors of eukaryotic Mic60. This interaction, responsible for making contact sites at mitochondrial envelopes, has been conserved in modern alphaproteobacteria despite more than a billion years of evolutionary divergence. Our results suggest a role for Mic60 in photosynthetic ICM development and contact site formation at alphaproteobacterial envelopes. Overall, we provide support for the hypothesis that mitochondrial cristae evolved from alphaproteobacterial ICMs, and therefore have improved our understanding of the nature of the mitochondrial ancestor.",

However, sparse sampling across finer-scale regions impedes our understanding of the emergence of present-day population structure. Moreover, oral histories maintained by many Indian populations are only partially documented. To address these gaps and investigate the interplay between oral and genetic histories, we analyzed whole-genome sequences from 158 Southwest Indian individuals identifying as Bunt, Kodava, Nair, and Kapla. From community interviews and historical literature, we found that all four populations have references to non-Indian origins. We observed that while the Kapla are genetically differentiated from the Bunt, Kodava, and Nair, all four populations are genetically most similar to other Indian populations. Our results demonstrate that oral and genetic histories may not always provide consistent accounts of population origins and suggest community-engaged, multi-disciplinary investigations to understand their relationship.",

We tested the hypothesis that spatial tradeoffs between food and safety can change the drivers of population distribution, caused by opposing patterns of density-dependent habitat selection (DDHS) that are predicted by the multidimensional ideal free distribution. We addressed this using winter aerial survey data of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus canadensis) spanning four decades. Supporting our hypothesis, we found positive DDHS for food (herbaceous biomass) and negative DDHS for safety (openness and roughness), such that the primary driver of habitat selection switched from food to safety as elk density decreased from 9.3 to 2.0 elk/km2. Our results demonstrate how population density can drive landscape-level shifts in population distribution, confounding habitat selection inference and prediction, and potentially affecting community-level interactions.",

    "abstract": "FFPE (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tissue archives are the largest repository of clinically annotated human specimens. Despite numerous advances in technology, current methods for sequencing of FFPE-fixed single-cells are slow, labour intensive, insufficiently sensitive and have a low resolution, making it difficult to fully exploit their enormous research and clinical potential. Here we introduce single nuclei pathology sequencing (snPATHO-Seq), a sensitive and efficient high-throughput platform to profile the transcriptome of single nuclei extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. snPATHO-Seq combines an optimised nuclei extraction protocol from archival samples with 10x Genomics probe-based technology targeting the whole transcriptome. We performed direct comparison of the Fixed RNA Profiling (FRP) and established 3 single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) workflows through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of matched fresh and fixed samples derived from the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. FRP detected 2.1 times more transcripts in the fixed sample than the 3 kit did in the fresh sample. Low mitochondrial genes detection using the FRP was translated into 99.9 percent of cells passing the QC filters, compared to 81.6 percent of cells using the v3.1 chemistry. We then optimized snPATHO-Seq and applied it to a human breast cancer metastasis to the liver collected at autopsy and preserved in FFPE, a particularly challenging sample type. Remarkably, at 28,000 reads/cell snPATHO-Seq was able to detect a median of 1850 genes/cell and 3,216 UMI counts/cell. Comparison of snPATHO-Seq with spatial transcriptomics data (10x Genomics Visium FFPE v1) derived from an adjacent section of the same sample revealed a strong correlation, validating the accuracy of the snPATHO-Seq data. Gene expression data from snPATHO-Seq was used to predict cell type composition within each spatial transcriptomic location via deconvolution. Overall, snPATHO-Seq enables high quality and sensitivity snRNA-Seq from preserved tissue samples, unlocking the vast archives of FFPE tissues and thereby allowing extensive retrospective clinical genomic studies.",

Linear combinations of multiple methylation sites, termed epigenetic clocks, can inform us of the chronological age and predict multiple health-related outcomes. However, why some sites correlate with lifespan, healthspan, or specific medical conditions remains poorly understood. Kidney fibrosis is the common pathway for Chronic Kidney Disease, which affects 10% of Europe and USA population. Here we identify epigenetic clocks and methylation sites that correlate with kidney function. Moreover, we identify methylation sites that have a unique methylation signature in the kidney. Methylation levels in the majority of these sites correlates with kidney state and function. When kidney function deteriorates, all of these sites regress towards the common methylation pattern observed in other tissues. Interestingly, while the majority of sites are less methylated in the kidney and become more methylated with loss of function, a fraction of the sites are highly methylated in the kidney and become less methylated when kidney function declines. These methylation sites are enriched for specific transcription-factor binding sites. In a large subset of sites, changes in methylation pattern are accompanied by changes in gene expression in kidneys of chronic kidney disease patients. These results support the information theory of aging, and the hypothesis that the unique tissue identity, as captured by methylation patterns, is lost as tissue function declines. However, this information loss is not random, but guided towards a baseline that is dependent on the genomic loci.",

While small EVs (sEVs; <100-200 nm, exosomes) are intensely investigated, the properties and functions of medium and large EVs (big EVs [bEVs]; >200 nm, microvesicles) are less well explored. Here, we identify bEVs and sEVs as distinct EV populations, and determine that bEVs are released in a greater bEV:sEV ratio in the aggressive human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. PalmGRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based EV reporter, reveals dose- dependent EV biodistribution at non-lethal and physiological EV dosages, as compared to lipophilic fluorescent dyes. Remarkably, the bEVs and sEVs exhibit unique biodistribution profiles, et individually promote in vivo tumor growth in a syngeneic immunocompetent TNBC breast tumor murine model. The bEVs and sEVs share mass spectrometry (MS)- identified tumor progression-associated EV surface membrane proteins (tpEVSurfMEMs), which include SLC29A1, CD9 and CD44. tpEVSurfMEM depletion attenuates EV lung organotropism, alters biodistribution, and reduces protumorigenic potential. This study identifies distinct in vivo property and function of bEVs and sEVs in breast cancer, which suggest the significant role of bEVs in diseases, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "When we pay attention to someone, do we focus only on the sound they make, the word they use, or do we form a mental space shared with the speaker we want to pay attention to? Some would argue that the human language is no other than a simple signal, but others claim that human beings understand each other not only by relying on the words that have been said but also formed a shared ground in the specific conversation. This debate was raised early, but the conclusion remains vague. Our study aimed to investigate how attention modulates the neural coupling between the speaker and the listener in a cocktail party paradigm. The temporal response function (TRF) method was employed to reveal how the listener was coupled to the speaker at the neural level. The results showed that the neural coupling between the listener and the attended speaker peaked 5 seconds before speech onset at the delta band over the left frontal region, and was correlated with speech comprehension performance. In contrast, the attentional processing of speech acoustics and semantics occurred primarily at a later stage after speech onset and was not significantly correlated with comprehension performance. These findings suggest that our human brain might have adopted a predictive mechanism to achieve speaker-listener neural coupling for successful speech comprehension.\n\nThree key pointsO_LIListeners EEG signals coupled to the speakers 5 s before the speech onset, which revealed a \"beyond the stimulus\" attentional modulation.\nC_LIO_LISpeaker-listener attentional coupling is correlated to the listeners comprehension performance, but the speech-listeners coupling didnt.\nC_LIO_LIThe implementation of temporal response function methods and the neural language methods yielded novel perspectives to the analysis of the inter-brain studies.\nC_LI",

Mitochondrial function in the NAc is critically implicated in the association between anxiety and social competitiveness, and the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) in NAc neurons has been shown to regulate anxiety-related behaviors. However, it remains unexplored whether accumbal Mfn2 levels also affect social behavior and whether Mfn2 actions in the emotional and social domain are driven by distinct cell types. Here, we found that subordinate-prone highly anxious rats show reduced accumbal Mfn2 levels and that Mfn2 overexpression promotes dominant behavior. In mice, selective Mfn2 downregulation in NAc dopamine D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) induced social subordination, accompanied by reduced mitochondrial function and decreased neuronal excitability. Instead, D1-MSN-targeted Mfn2 downregulation affected competitive ability only transiently mainly by increases in anxiety-like behaviors. Our results assign dissociable cell-type specific roles to Mfn2 in the NAc in modulating social dominance and anxiety.",

At least one of its three cysteine residue is functionally essential, and its oxidation state determines the specific function of the enzyme. DJ-1 was recently reported to be persulfidated in mammalian cell lines, but the implications of this post-translational modification have not yet been analyzed. Here, we report that recombinant DJ-1 is reversibly persulfidated at cysteine 106 by reaction with various sulfane donors and subsequently inhibited. Strikingly, this reaction is orders of magnitude faster than C106 oxidation by H2O2, and persulfidated DJ-1 behaves differently than sulfinylated DJ-1.

    "abstract": "The accurate estimation of cell surface receptor abundance for single cell transcriptomics data is important for the tasks of cell type and phenotype categorization and cell-cell interaction quantification. We previously developed an unsupervised receptor abundance estimation technique named SPECK (Surface Protein abundance Estimation using CKmeans-based clustered thresholding) to address the challenges associated with accurate abundance estimation. In that paper, we concluded that SPECK results in improved concordance with Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) data relative to comparative unsupervised abundance estimation techniques using only single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In this paper, we outline a new supervised receptor abundance estimation method called STREAK (gene Set Testing-based Receptor abundance Estimation using Adjusted distances and cKmeans thresholding) that leverages associations learned from joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq training data and a thresholded gene set scoring mechanism to estimate receptor abundance for scRNA-seq target data. We evaluate STREAK relative to both unsupervised and supervised receptor abundance estimation techniques using two evaluation approaches on three joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq datasets that represent two human tissue types. We conclude that STREAK outperforms other abundance estimation strategies and provides a more biologically interpretable and transparent statistical model.",

It is rich in nutrients, drought-tolerant, and a climate change contender for future agriculture. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify culturable bacterial endophytes. Our study assessed the mean CFUs/mL among the tuberous roots, stems, and leaves to determine the density and diversity using ANOVA. It was a quantitatively controlled experiment in which seeds were grown in a greenhouse. The bacteria number varied from 1.29 x 108 to 3.5 x 108 CFU/ml of broth, with the highest in the tuberous roots and the lowest in the leaves. At a 5% significant level, we revealed that there is a difference among the bacterial densities of the plant parts. Shannon-Weiner diversity showed that there is a higher diversity of bacteria in the tuberous roots. Of the isolates that were obtained, 53.8% belonged to Enterobacter, 15.4% to Bacillus, 15.4% to Pantoea, and 7.67% to Burkholderia. These discoveries have made us more aware of the endophytic bacteria we now have. These strains might thus be used in food crops to boost productivity, enabling food security, especially in Africa. The significance of the isolates in biological control, agriculture, and biotechnology for growth promotion will be determined by further research.",

    "abstract": "A substrate specificity of the pharmaceutically attractive tumor-promoter SIRT5 was already investigated multiple times by advanced proteomic tools. However, the present bioinformatic analysis brings new highlights to the knowledge about the lysine demalonylation activity of SIRT5, a member of the sirtuin family with multiple roles in aging and age-related diseases. It shows unreported functional aspects of the lysine demalonylated substrates in Eukaryotic translation elongation (ETE), Amino acid and derivative metabolism (AADM), and Selenoamino acid metabolism (SAM). The cluster of the elongation factors (EEF1A1, EEF2, EEF1D, and EEF1G) belonging to ETE participates in the peptide chain elongation and the export of the tRNA-s from the nucleus to the primary sites of the proteosynthesis. SIRT5 regulates the activity of the key enzymes with tumor-promoting functions involved in AADM (GLUD1, SHMT1, ACAT1). In contrast, SIRT5 also lysine demalonylates tumor suppressor substrates as a part of the AADM and SAM interaction networks (ALDH9A1, BHMT, GNMT). It indicates comparable functions like SIRT3, which has dual tumor promoter/oncogene functions. Similar to the roles of the sirtuins, the SAM pathway impacts longevity, protects against cardiovascular diseases, and is associated with hepatic steatosis. The selen supplementation mediates the calorie restriction effect, which increases the NAD+/NADH ratio in the cells and stimulates the expression of SIRT5 and other sirtuins. SIRT5 in turn regulates the selenocysteine synthesis through the lysine demalonylation of the participating ribosomal proteins, SECISBP2 and GNMT, which creates a regulatory loop.",

By quantifying the effective binding affinity of IgG monoclonal antibodies to engineered antigen sensors, we discovered sharp gradients in crowding within a few nanometers of the crowded membrane surface. Our measurements on human cancer cells support the hypothesis that raft-like membrane domains exclude bulky membrane proteins and glycoproteins. Our facile and high-throughput method to quantify spatial crowding heterogeneities on live cell membranes may facilitate monoclonal antibody design and provide a mechanistic understanding of plasma membrane biophysical organization.",

    "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) maintain translation fidelity through accurate charging by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and codon:anticodon base pairing with the mRNA at the ribosome. Mistranslation occurs when an amino acid not specified by the genetic message is incorporated into proteins and has applications in biotechnology, therapeutics and is relevant to disease. Since the alanyl-tRNA synthetase uniquely recognizes a G3:U70 base pair in tRNAAla and the anticodon plays no role in charging, tRNAAla variants with anticodon mutations have the potential to mis-incorporate alanine. Here, we characterize the impact of the 60 non-alanine tRNAAla anticodon variants on the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overall, 36 tRNAAla anticodon variants decreased growth in single-or multi-copy. Mass spectrometry analysis of the cellular proteome revealed that 52 of 57 anticodon variants, not decoding alanine or stop codons, induced mistranslation when on single-copy plasmids. Variants with G/C rich anticodons resulted in larger growth deficits than A/U rich variants. In most instances, synonymous anticodon variants impact growth differently, with anticodons containing U at base 34 being the least impactful. For anticodons generating the same amino acid substitution, reduced growth generally correlated with the abundance of detected mistranslation events. Differences in decoding specificity, even between synonymous anticodons, resulted in each tRNAAla variant mistranslating unique sets of peptides and proteins. We suggest that these differences in decoding specificity are also important in determining the impact of tRNAAla anticodon variants.",

    "abstract": "The human GPCR family comprises circa 800 members, activated by hundreds of thousands of compounds. Bitter taste receptors, TAS2Rs, constitute a large and distinct subfamily, expressed orally and extra-orally and involved in physiological and pathological conditions. TAS2R14 is the most promiscuous member, with over 150 agonists and 3 antagonists known prior to this study. Due to the scarcity of inhibitors and to the importance of chemical probes for exploring TAS2R14 functions, we aimed to discover new ligands for this receptor, with emphasis on antagonists. To cope with the lack of experimental structure of the receptor, we used a mixed experimental/computational methodology which iteratively improved the performance of the predicted structure. The increasing number of active compounds, obtained here through experimental screening of FDA-approved drug library, and of chemically synthesized flufenamic acid derivatives, enabled the refinement of the binding pocket, which in turn improved the structure-based virtual screening reliability. This mixed approach led to the identification of 10 new antagonists and 200 new agonists of TAS2R14, illustrating the untapped potential of rigorous medicinal chemistry for TAS2Rs. The iterative framework suggested residues involved in the activation process, is suitable for expanding bitter and bitter-masking chemical space, and is applicable to other promiscuous GPCRs lacking experimental structures.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=172 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517821v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@30bd42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d94fbforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2858borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d9af2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal hormones ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) have opposite secretion patterns, as well as opposite effects on metabolism and food intake. Beyond their role in energy homeostasis, gastrointestinal hormones have also been suggested to modulate the reward system. However, the potential of ghrelin and GLP-1 to modulate reward responses in humans has not been systematically reviewed before. To evaluate the convergence of published results, we first conduct a multi-level kernel density meta-analysis of studies reporting a positive association of ghrelin (Ncomb= 353, 18 contrasts) and a negative association of GLP-1 (Ncomb = 258, 12 contrasts) and reward responses measured using task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Second, we complement the meta-analysis using a systematic literature review, focusing on distinct reward phases and applications in clinical populations that may account for variability across studies. In line with preclinical research, we find that ghrelin increases reward responses across studies in key nodes of the motivational circuit, such as the nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and the dorsal mid insula. In contrast, for GLP-1, we did not find sufficient convergence in support of reduced reward responses. Instead, our systematic review identifies potential differences of GLP-1 on anticipatory versus consummatory reward responses. Based on a systematic synthesis of available findings, we conclude that there is considerable support for the neuromodulatory potential of gut-based circulating peptides on reward responses. To unlock their potential for clinical applications, future studies may move beyond anticipated rewards to cover other reward facets.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518539v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c0b00org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19630e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16498c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@169469e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Uso1/p115 and RAB1 tether ER-derived vesicles to the Golgi. Uso1/p115 contains a globular-head-domain (GHD), a coiled-coil (CC) mediating dimerization/tethering and a C-terminal region (CTR) interacting with golgins. Uso1/p115 is recruited to vesicles by RAB1. Paradoxically, genetic studies placed Uso1 acting upstream of, or in conjunction with RAB1 (Sapperstein et al., 1996). We selected two missense mutations in uso1 resulting in E6K and G540S substitutions in the GHD permitting growth of otherwise inviable rab1-deficient Aspergillus nidulans. Remarkably, the double mutant suppresses the complete absence of RAB1. Full-length Uso1 and CTR{Delta} proteins are dimeric and the GHD lacking the CC/CTR is monomeric irrespective of whether they carry or not E6K/G540S. Microscopy showed recurrence of Uso1 on puncta (60 sec half-life) colocalizing with RAB1 and less so with early Golgi markers Sed5 and GeaA/Gea1/Gea2. Localization of Uso1 but not of Uso1E6K/G540S to puncta is abolished by compromising RAB1 function, indicating that E6K/G540S creates interactions bypassing RAB1. By S-tag-coprecipitation we demonstrate that Uso1 is an associate of the Sed5/Bos1/Bet1/Sec22 SNARE complex zippering vesicles with the Golgi, with Uso1E6K/G540S showing stronger association. Bos1 and Bet1 bind the Uso1 GHD directly, but Bet1 is a strong E6K/G540S-independent binder, whereas Bos1 is weaker but becomes as strong as Bet1 when the GHD carries E6K/G540S. AlphaFold2 predicts that G540S actually increases binding of GHD to the Bos1 Habc domain. In contrast, E6K seemingly increases membrane targeting of an N-terminal amphipathic -helix, explaining phenotypic additivity. Overexpression of E6K/G540S and wild-type GHD complemented uso1{Delta}. Thus, a GHD monomer provides the essential Uso1 functions, demonstrating that long-range tethering activity is dispensable. Therefore, when enhanced by E6K/G540S, Uso1 binding to Bos1/Bet1 required to regulate SNAREs bypasses both the contribution of RAB1 to Uso1 recruitment and the reported role of RAB1 in SNARE complex formation (Lupashin and Waters, 1997), suggesting that the latter is consequence of the former.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimers disease (AD), Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) oligomers are considered an appealing therapeutic- and diagnostic target. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms associated with the pathological accumulation or structure of A{beta} oligomers remains an enigma to the scientific community. Here we demonstrate the strong seeding properties of unique A{beta} fragment signatures and show that the truncated A{beta} peptides of residues A{beta}1-23, A{beta}1-24 and A{beta}1-25, rapidly seed to form small, SDS-PAGE stable assemblies of [~]5kDa to [~]14kDa molecular mass range. Mass spectrometry analysis of SDS-PAGE fractionated and gel extracted oligomers revealed that the truncated A{beta} isoforms of residues 1-23 to 1-25 form stable entities with low molecular weight (LMW) oligomers, which strongly resemble the regularly reported A{beta} entities of putative dimeric or trimeric assemblies found in human post-mortem AD and Tg mouse brain extracts. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings in the mouse hippocampus indicate that LMW A{beta} assemblies formed by fragments A{beta}1-23 to A{beta}1-25 significantly impair long-term-potentiation (LTP) in the absence of full-length A{beta}1-42. Extensive antibody screening highlights the important observation, that the LMW A{beta} assemblies formed by these truncated A{beta} peptides escape immuno-detection using conventional, conformation specific antibodies but, more importantly, the clinical antibody aducanumab. Our novel findings suggest that there are new A{beta} target \"loopholes\" which can be exploited for the development of therapeutic antibodies with binding properties against stable target hotspots present in A{beta} oligomers. We provide here a first example of a new class of monoclonal antibody with unique binding properties against LMW A{beta} oligomers, in the absence of binding to large fibrillar A{beta} assemblies, or dense amyloid plaques. Our research supports a novel, unparalleled approach for targeting early, pathological A{beta} species during the insidious phase of AD and prior to the appearance of large oligomeric or protofibrilar assemblies.",

    "abstract": "The dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) receive dopaminergic projections that control motor functions and reward-related behavior. It remains poorly understood how dopamine release dynamics across different temporal scales in these regions are coupled to behavioral outcomes. Here, we employ the dopamine sensor dLight1.3b together with multi-region fiber photometry and machine learning-based analysis to decode dopamine dynamics across striatum during self-paced exploratory behavior in mice. Our data show a striking coordination of rapidly fluctuating signal in the DS, carrying information across dopamine levels, with a slower signal in the VS, consisting mainly of slow-paced transients. Importantly, these release dynamics correlated with discrete behavioral motifs, such as turns, running and grooming on a subsecond-to-minutes time scale. Disruption of dopamine dynamics with cocaine caused randomization of action selection sequencing and disturbance of DS-VS coordination. The data suggest that distinct dopamine dynamics of DS and VS jointly encode behavioral sequences during unconstrained activity with DS modulating the stringing together of actions and VS the signal to initiate and sustain the selected action.\n\nSignificance StatementNew genetically encoded dopamine sensors offer unprecedented temporal resolution for measurement of dopamine release dynamics across different brain regions over extended periods. In this study, we use the dopamine sensor dLight1.3b to decipher the role of dopamine release dynamics in the dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) of mice during simple, self-paced exploratory behavior. By AI-based splitting of behavioral kinematics into individual motifs, we link differential but highly cooperative dopamine release dynamics of DS and VS with movements on a subsecond-to-minutes time scales. In addition to coupling region-specific dopamine dynamics to behavioral sequences, our study demonstrates the strength of a machine learning-based data analysis pipeline that can be readily applied to other neurotransmitters for which genetically encoded biosensors are available.",

    "abstract": "To maintain stable flight, animals continuously perform trimming adjustments to compensate for internal and external perturbations. Whereas animals use many different sensory modalities to detect such perturbations, insects rely extensively on optic flow to modify their motor output and remain on course. We studied this behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by exploiting the optomotor response, a robust reflex in which an animal steers so as to minimize the magnitude of rotatory optic flow it perceives. Whereas the behavioral and algorithmic structure of the optomotor response has been studied in great detail, its neural implementation is not well-understood. In this paper, we present findings implicating a group of nearly homomorphic descending neurons, the DNg02s, as a core component for the optomotor response in flying Drosophila. Prior work on these cells suggested that they regulate the mechanical power to the flight system, presumably via connections to asynchronous flight motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord. When we chronically inactivated these cells, we observed that the magnitude of the optomotor response was diminished in proportion to the number of cells silenced, suggesting that the cells also regulate bilaterally asymmetric steering responses via population coding. During an optomotor response, flies coordinate changes in wing motion with movements of their head, abdomen, and hind legs, which are also diminished when the DNg02 cells are silenced. Using two-photon functional imaging, we show that the DNg02 cells respond most strongly to patterns of horizontal motion and that neuronal activity is closely correlated to motor output. However, unilateral optogenetic activation of DNg02 neurons does not elicit the asymmetric changes in wing motion characteristic of the optomotor response to a visual stimulus, but rather generates bilaterally symmetric increases in wingbeat amplitude. We interpret our experiments to suggest that flight maneuvers in flies require a more nuanced coordination of power muscles and steering muscles than previously appreciated, and that the physical flight apparatus of a fly might permit mechanical power to be distributed differentially between the two wings. Thus, whereas our experiments identify the DNg02 cells as a critical component of the optomotor reflex, our results suggest that other classes of descending cells targeting the steering muscle motor neurons are also required for the behavior.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining stable and transient quiescence in differentiated and stem cells, respectively, requires repression of the cell cycle. The plant RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) has been implicated in stem cell maintenance, presumably by forming repressor complexes with E2F transcription factors. Surprisingly we find that mutations in all three canonical E2Fs do not compromise the cell cycle, but similarly to RBR silencing, result in overproliferation. Contrary to the growth arrest upon RBR silencing, when exit from proliferation to differentiation is inhibited, the e2fabc mutant develops enlarged organs with supernumerary stem and differentiated cells as the quiescence is compromised. While E2F, RBR and the M-phase regulatory MYB3Rs are part of the DREAM repressor complexes, and recruited to overlapping groups of targets, they regulate distinct sets of genes. Only the loss of E2Fs but not the MYB3Rs interferes with quiescence, which might be due to the ability of E2Fs to control both G1-S and some key G2-M targets. We conclude that collectively the three canonical E2Fs in complex with RBR have central roles in establishing cellular quiescence during organ development, leading to enhanced plant growth.",

After generating and calibrating the sensors, we measured the osmotic pressure in blastomeres of early zebrafish embryos as well as in the interstitial fluid between the cells of the blastula by monitoring the size of droplets previously inserted in the embryo. Our results show a balance between intracellular and interstitial osmotic pressures, with values of approximately 0.7 MPa, but a large pressure imbalance between the inside and outside of the embryo. The ability to measure osmotic pressure in 3D multicellular systems (developing embryos, organoids, etc.) will help understand its role in fundamental biological processes.",

We developed a cell-based high-content screening platform and identified small molecules that both promote and inhibit condensation of SARS-CoV-2 N. Interestingly, these host-targeted small molecules exhibited condensate-modulatory effects across all HCoV Ns. Some have also been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E viral infections in cell culture. Our work reveals that the assembly dynamics of N condensates can be regulated by small molecules with therapeutic potential. Our approach allows for screening based on viral genome sequences alone and might enable rapid paths to drug discovery with value for confronting future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin contributes to widespread developmental processes, including root and shoot meristem maintenance, phyllotaxy, and vascular patterning. Although auxin and cytokinin are potent regulators of plant development, our understanding of crosstalk between these hormones is limited to few model systems. The moss Physcomitrium patens (formerly Physcomitrella patens) is a powerful system for studying plant hormone function. Auxin and cytokinin play similar roles in regulating moss gametophore (upright shoot) architecture, as they do in flowering plant shoots. However, auxin-cytokinin crosstalk is poorly understood in moss. Here we find that the ratio of auxin to cytokinin is an important determinant of development in P. patens, especially during leaf development and branch stem cell initiation. Addition of high levels of auxin to P. patens gametophores blocks leaf outgrowth. However, simultaneous addition of high levels of both auxin and cytokinin partially restores leaf outgrowth, suggesting that the ratio of these hormones is the overriding factor. Likewise, during branch initiation and outgrowth, chemical inhibition of auxin synthesis phenocopies cytokinin application. Finally, cytokinin insensitive mutants resemble plants with altered auxin signaling and are hypersensitive to auxin. In summary, our results suggest that the ratio between auxin and cytokinin signaling is the basis for developmental decisions in the moss gametophore.",

    "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has lasted for three years since its outbreak, however its origin is still unknown. Here, we analyzed the genotypes of 3.14 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the amino acid 614 of the Spke (S) and the amino acid 48 of NS8 (nonstructural protein 8), and identified 16 linkage haplotypes. The GL haplotype (S_614G and NS8_48L) was the major haplotype driving the global pandemic and accounted for 99.2% of the sequenced genomes, while the DL haplotype (S_614D and NS8_48L) caused the pandemic in China in the spring of 2020 and accounted for approximately 60% of the genomes in China and 0.45% of the global genomes. The GS (S_614G and NS8_48S), DS (S_614D and NS8_48S) and NS (S_614N and NS8_48S) haplotypes accounted for 0.26%, 0.06%, and 0.0067% of the genomes, respectively. The main evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 is DS[-&gt;]DL[-&gt;]GL, whereas the other haplotypes are minor byproducts in the evolution. Surprisingly, the newest haplotype GL had the oldest time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA), which was May 1 2019 by mean, while the oldest haplotype had the newest tMRCA with a mean of October 17, indicating that the ancestral strains that gave birth to GL had been extinct and replaced by the more adapted newcomer at the place of its origin, just like the sequential rise and fall of the delta and omicron variants. However, they arrived and evolved into toxic strains and ignited a pandemic in China where the GL strains did not exist at the end of 2019. The GL strains had spread all over the world before they were discovered, and ignited the global pandemic, which had not been noticed until the pandemic was declared in China. However, the GL haplotype had little influence in China during the early phase of the pandemic due to its late arrival as well as the strict transmission controls in China. Therefore, we propose two major onsets of the COVID-19 pandemic, one was mainly driven by the haplotype DL in China, the other was driven by the haplotype GL globally.",

    "abstract": "The crocodiles and their close relatives, the alligators and gharials, have a compelling evolutionary history. They are a clade of great antiquity, with their most recent common ancestor emerging within the Mesozoic. However, unlike many groups of such a great age, the crocodilians have an extensive crown-group, with around two dozen extant examples. They have a limited ecomorphology, which has varied little since their inception, and their biogeography has been shown to interact closely with climate. The biogeography of crocodilians in deep time remains an outstanding question, which is complicated further by the limitations of the fossil record. The fossil record is fundamentally incomplete yet represents the most common method used to infer biogeography of organisms. The scarcity of fossil remains makes apparent absences difficult to confirm. Preservation bias will promote fossil occurrences in areas with a high sedimentation rate, which may not be the true ecological niche for a given taxon. This study uses species distribution models of extant crocodilians to infer the ecological niche of related taxa in the Maastrichtian and Danian. Models indicate a much wider latitudinal range than is observed among extant examples, and the invasion of new ecospace following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In addition, we find that while temperature is of significance to crocodilian biogeography, it is precipitation that is the most influential climatic variable.",

    "abstract": "Androgen mimicking environmental chemicals can bind to Androgen receptor (AR) and can cause severe effects on the reproductive health of males. Predicting such endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the human exposome is vital for improving current chemical regulations. To this end, QSAR models have been developed to predict androgen binders. However, a continuous structure-activity relationship (SAR) wherein chemicals with similar structure have similar activity does not always hold. Activity landscape analysis can help map the structure-activity landscape and identify unique features such as activity cliffs. Here we performed a systematic investigation of the chemical diversity along with the global and local structure-activity landscape of a curated list of 144 AR binding chemicals. Specifically, we clustered the AR binding chemicals and visualized the associated chemical space. Thereafter, consensus diversity plot was used to assess the global diversity of the chemical space. Subsequently, the structure-activity landscape was investigated using SAS maps which capture the activity difference and structural similarity among the AR binders. This analysis led to a subset of 41 AR binding chemicals forming 86 activity cliffs, of which 14 are activity cliff generators. Additionally, SALI scores were computed for all pairs of AR binding chemicals and the SALI heatmap was also used to evaluate the activity cliffs identified using SAS map. Finally, we provide a classification of the 86 activity cliffs into six categories using structural information of chemicals at different levels. Overall, this investigation reveals the heterogeneous nature of the structure-activity landscape of AR binding chemicals and provides insights which will be crucial in preventing false prediction of chemicals as androgen binders and developing predictive computational toxicity models in the future.",

    "abstract": "Gentle stroking of the skin is a common social touch behavior with positive affective consequences. A preference for slow versus fast stroking of hairy skin has been closely linked to the firing of unmyelinated C-tactile (CT) somatosensory afferents. Because the firing of CT afferents strongly correlates with touch pleasantness, the CT pathway has been considered a social-affective sensory pathway. Recently, ablation of the spinothalamic pathway-thought to convey all C-fiber sensations-in patients with cancer pain impaired pain, temperature, and itch, but not ratings of pleasant touch. This suggested integration of A and CT fiber input in the spinal cord, or A-fiber contributions to computations of touch pleasantness in the brain. However, the causal contribution of A-fibers to touch pleasantness- in humans without pain-remains unknown. In the current, single-blinded study we performed two types of peripheral nerve blocks in healthy adults to temporarily eliminate the contribution of A-fibers to touch perception. Our findings show that when A-fiber function is greatly diminished, the perceived intensity and pleasantness of both gentle stroking and deep pressure are nearly abolished. These findings demonstrate that explicit perception of the pleasantness of CT-targeted brushing and pressure both critically depend on A-fibers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly-life adversity (ELA) is associated with increased risk for mood disorders including depression and substance use disorders. These are characterized by impaired reward-related behaviors, suggesting compromised operations of reward-related brain circuits. However, the brain regions engaged by ELA that mediate these enduring consequences of ELA remain largely unknown. In an animal model of ELA, we have identified aberrant reward-seeking behaviors, a discovery that provides a framework for assessing the underlying circuits.\n\nMethodsEmploying TRAP2 male and female mice, in which neurons activated within a defined timeframe are permanently tagged, we compared ELA and control-reared mice, assessing the quantity and distribution of ELA-related neuronal activation. After validating the TRAP2 results using native cFos labeling, we defined the molecular identity of this population of activated neurons.\n\nResultsWe uniquely demonstrate that the TRAP2 system is feasible and efficacious in neonatal mice. Surprisingly, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is robustly and almost exclusively activated by ELA and is the only region distinguishing ELA from typical rearing. Remarkably, a large proportion of ELA-activated PVT neurons express CRFR1, the receptor for the stress-related peptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), but these neurons do not express CRH itself.\n\nConclusionsWe show here that the PVT, an important component of reward circuits which is known to encode remote, emotionally salient experiences to influence future motivated behaviors, encodes adverse experiences as remote as those occurring during the early postnatal period and is thus poised to contribute to the enduring deficits in reward-related behaviors consequent to ELA.",

    "abstract": "Astroglial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of Huntingtons disease (HD), and glial replacement can ameliorate disease course. To establish the topographic relationship of diseased astrocytes to medium spiny neuron (MSN) synapses in HD, we used 2-photon imaging to map the relationship of tRFP-tagged striatal astrocytes and rabies-traced, EGFP-tagged coupled neuronal pairs, in R6/2 HD and wild-type (WT) mice. The tagged, prospectively-identified corticostriatal synapses were then studied by correlated light electron microscopy followed by serial block-face scanning EM, allowing nm scale assessment of synaptic structure in 3D. By this means, we compared the astrocytic engagement of single striatal synapses in HD and WT brains. R6/2 HD astrocytes exhibited constricted domains, with significantly less coverage of mature dendritic spines than WT astrocytes, despite enhanced engagement of immature, thin spines. These data suggest that disease-dependent changes in astroglial engagement and sequestration of MSN synapses enable the high synaptic and extrasynaptic levels of glutamate and K+ that underlie the striatal hyperexcitability of HD. As such, these data suggest that astrocytic structural pathology may causally contribute to the synaptic dysfunction and disease phenotype of those neurodegenerative disorders characterized by network overexcitation.\n\nSignificance StatementAstrocytic physiological dysfunction contributes to development of the neurodegenerative phenotype in Huntingtons disease (HD), but the structural correlates to this dysfunction are unclear. Here, we used a combination of viral tracing, phenotype-specific tagging, and ultrastructural modalities to reconstruct and study HD synapses at nm scale, in the neostriata of HD mice. We discovered significant impairment in the glial engagement of mature striatal synapses. In light of the known deficiencies in glutamate and potassium uptake by HD astrocytes, these findings suggest the potential for leakage of excitatory synaptic contents during neurotransmission, and hance a structural basis for neuronal hyperexcitability in HD. More broadly, our data suggest that astrocytic structural pathology may causally contribute to those neurodegenerative disorders associated with central hyperexcitability.",

However, in order to create comparable stimulation conditions to humans it is vital to evaluate and match electric fields across species. Numerical models to simulate electric fields are an important tool for experimental planning in NHPs and translation to human studies. It is thus essential to evaluate how anatomical details in NHP models affect NIBS electric fields. Here, we create a highly accurate head model of a non-human primate (NHP) from 10.5 T MR data. We systematically evaluate how muscle tissue and head size (due to different MRI fields of view) affect simulation results in transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation (TES and TMS). Our findings indicate that the inclusion of muscle can affect TES electric field strength up to 29.5% while TMS is largely unaffected. Additionally, comparing a full head model to a cropped head model illustrates the impact of head size on electric fields for both TES and TMS. We find opposing effects between TES and TMS with an increase up to 13.5% for TES and a decrease up to 21.5% for TMS for the cropped head model compared to the full head model. Our results provide important insights into the level of anatomical detail needed for NHP head models and can inform future translational efforts for NIBS studies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe created a high resolution non-human primate FEM head model from 10.5 T MR data.\nC_LIO_LIWe ran transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation (TES and TMS) simulations to evaluate the effects of muscle and head size on the induced electric field in the brain.\nC_LIO_LIWe simulated both isotropic and anisotropic muscle conductivities.\nC_LIO_LIMuscle tissue can greatly affect simulation results for TES (increase electric field strength by up to 29.5%), but not for TMS.\nC_LIO_LIThere are opposing, but large effects of using a full head model versus a cropped head model for both TES (increase up to 13.5%) and TMS (decrease of up to 21.5%)\nC_LI",

Forty-five electroencephalographic sleep recordings were collected during a daytime nap after motor sequence learning by physical practice, motor imagery or action observation. Our findings reveal that a temporal cluster-based organization of sleep spindles underlies motor memory consolidation in all groups, albeit with distinct behavioral outcomes. A daytime nap offers an early sleep window promoting the retention of motor skills learned by physical practice and motor imagery, and its generalizability towards the inter-manual transfer of skill after action observation.

    "abstract": "The availability of high-calorie foods is likely a causative factor for high rates of obesity and metabolic disorders, which have been linked to food intake dysregulation. Several gut peptides have been implicated in feeding modulation and body mass accumulation. For example, glucagon peptide-like 1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosinetyrosine (PYY) have been shown to mediate satiety and reduce food intake. While systemic administration of such peptides has been explored as a therapy for metabolic disease, the effects of these hormones on taste signaling should also be considered given the importance of taste to feeding decisions. Peptide signaling systems are present in taste buds and oral GLP-1 and PYY signaling has been shown to influence taste responsiveness and feeding. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that genetic knockout of PYY in mice can impact on taste responsiveness and feeding and that viral overexpression of PYY in the salivary glands of these mice can rescue responsiveness. The present work uses AAV-mediated salivary gland treatment of both GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 and PYY encoding vectors to explore the impact of the presence of these peptides on taste and body-mass accumulation in wild-type mice with intact peptide signaling systems. Results showed a significant effect of salivary gland treatment on responsiveness to multiple taste qualities. Treatment with a vector designed to overexpress both peptides in saliva resulted in substantial reduction in body mass accumulation. These findings show taste modulation and impacts on body mass accumulation by the targeting of salivary glands with vectors designed to overexpress metabolic peptides in wild-type mice and suggest that the taste bud is a promising substrate for food intake modulation.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about how animals use tactile sensation to detect important objects and remember their location in a worldbased coordinate system. Here, we hypothesized that retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a key network for contextual memory and spatial navigation, represents the location of objects based on tactile sensation. We studied mice that palpate objects with their whiskers while running on a treadmill in a tactile virtual reality in darkness. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we discovered a population of neurons in agranular RSC that signal the location of tactile objects. Tactile object location responses do not simply reflect the sensory stimulus. Instead, they are highly task- and context-dependent and often predict the upcoming object before it is within reach. In addition, most tactile object location neurons also maintain a memory trace of the objects location. These data show that RSC encodes the location and arrangement of tactile objects in a spatial reference frame.",

    "abstract": "Rodent premotor cortex (M2) integrates information from sensory and cognitive networks for action selection and planning during goal-directed decision making. M2 function is regulated by cortical inputs and ascending neuromodulators, including norepinephrine (NE) released from the locus coeruleus (LC). LC-NE has been shown to modulate the signal to noise ratio of neural representations in target regions prior to decision execution, to increase the salience of relevant stimuli. Using rats performing a two-alternative forced choice task after administration of a {beta} adrenergic antagonist (propranolol), we show that action planning in M2 is mediated by {beta} adrenergic signaling. Loss of {beta} adrenergic signaling results in failure to suppress irrelevant action plans in M2 that disrupts decoding of cue related information, delays decision times, and increases trial omissions, particularly in females. Furthermore, we identify a potential mechanism for the sex bias in behavioral and neural changes after propranolol administration via differential expression of {beta}2 receptors across sexes, particularly on local inhibitory neurons. Overall, we show a critical role for {beta} adrenergic signaling in M2 during decision making by suppressing irrelevant information to enable efficient action planning and decision execution.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression intersects with neural activity to produce cortical circuits during brain development. However, the cell biological mechanisms linking gene expression to activity-dependent cortical circuit assembly remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate in mice that a newly discovered function of the neurodevelopmental disorder gene, Syngap1, is to cell-autonomously control intrinsic membrane excitability (IME) in developing cortical glutamatergic neurons. Syngap1 regulation of IME was mechanistically linked to wiring of a cortical circuit motif required for sensory processing and behavioral action. Restoring depressed IME in Syngap1 deficient neurons through genetic targeting of hyper-functional potassium currents unleashed deficient dendritic morphogenesis in upper lamina sensory cortex pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, enhancing dendritic morphogenesis was sufficient to stimulate assembly of translaminar feed-forward excitatory circuit motifs. Thus, Syngap1 promotes excitatory circuit assembly during cortical development by maintaining IME in a range that enables trophic neuronal activity to maximize pyramidal cell somatodendritic maturation and subsequent synapse formation.\n\nHighlightsO_LISyngap1 cell-autonomously tunes cortical pyramidal neuron IME in vivo\nC_LIO_LISyngap1-IME is regulated in part by control of neuronal potassium currents\nC_LIO_LISyngap1 enhancement of IME drives dendritic maturation in pyramidal cells\nC_LIO_LISyngap1 tuning of IME-regulated dendritic maturation promotes circuit assembly\nC_LI",

To address this gap, we present an automated workflow to map labeled neurons and astrocytes in the genetically distinct Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) mouse forebrains. We named the workflow COMBINe (Cell detectiOn in Mouse BraIN) as it combines modules from multiple pipelines.

    "abstract": "EEG correlates of olfaction are of fundamental and practical interest for many reasons. In the field of neural technologies, olfactory-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent an approach that could be useful for neurorehabilitation of anosmia, dysosmia and hyposmia. While the idea of a BCI that decodes neural responses to different odors and/or enables odor-based neurofeedback is appealing, the results of previous EEG investigations into the olfactory domain are rather inconsistent, particularly when non-primary processing of olfactory signals is concerned. Here we report the results from an EEG study where an olfaction-based instructed-delay task was implemented. We utilized an olfactory display and a sensor of respiration to present odors in a strictly controlled fashion. Spatio-spectral EEG properties were analyzed to assess the olfactory-related components. Under these experimental conditions, EEG components representing processing of olfactory information were found around channel C4, where changes were detected for the 12-Hz spectral component. Additionally, significant differences in EEG patterns were observed when responses to odors were compared to the responses to odorless stimuli. We conclude EEG recordings are suitable for detecting active processing of odors. As such they could be integrated in a BCI that strives to rehabilitate olfactory disabilities or uses odors for hedonistic purposes.",

    "abstract": "Non-epileptic seizures are identified as a common epileptogenic trigger. Early metaplasticity following seizures may contribute to epileptogenesis by abnormally altering synaptic strength and homeostatic plasticity. We now studied how in vitro epileptiform activity triggers early changes in CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in rat hippocampal slices and the involvement of lipid rafts in these early metaplasticity events. Two forms of epileptiform activity (EA) were induced: 1) interictal-like EA triggered by withdrawal of Mg2+ and K+ elevation to 6mM in the superfusion medium or 2) ictal-like EA induced by bicuculine (10M) delivery. LTP induced 30 min post EA was impaired, an effect more pronounced after ictal-like EA. LTP recovered to control levels 60 min post interictal-like EA but was still impaired 60 min after ictal-like EA. The synaptic molecular events underlying this altered LTP were investigated 30 min post EA. Synaptosomes isolated from parallel slices showed enhanced AMPA GluA1 Ser831 phosphorylation but decreased Ser 845 phosphorylation and a marked decrease in GluA1/GluA2 ratio. A marked decrease in flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 levels concomitantly with a moderate increase in PSD-95 and marked increase in gephyrin levels.\n\nAltogether, EA differentially influences hippocampal CA1 LTP thorough regulation of GluA1/GluA2 levels and AMPA GluA1 phosphorylation suggesting altered LTP post-seizures may be a relevant target of antiepileptogenic therapies. In addition, this metaplasticity is also associated with marked alterations in classic and synaptic lipid raft markers, suggesting these may also constitute promising targets in epileptogenesis prevention.",

    "abstract": "Rapid movements of limbs and appendages, faster than those produced by simple muscle contraction alone, are generated through mechanical networks consisting of springs and latches. The latch plays a central role in these spring-loaded mechanisms, but the structural details of the latch are not always known. The mandibles of the trapjaw ant Odontomachus kuroiwae closes the mandible extremely quickly to capture prey or to perform mandible-powered defensive jumps to avoid potential threats. The jump is mediated by a mechanical spring and latch system embodied in the mandible. An ant can strike the tip of the mandible onto the surface of an obstacle (prey, predator, or ground) in order to bounce its body away from potential threats. The angular velocity of the closing mandible was 2.3x104 rad/s. Latching of the joint is a key mechanism to aid the storage of energy required to power the ballistic movements of the mandibles. We have identified the fine structure of two latch systems on the mandible forming a  balljoint using an X-ray micro-computational tomography system (X-ray micro-CT) and X-ray live imaging with a synchrotron. Here we describe the surface of the inner section of the socket and a projection on the lip of the ball. The X-ray live imaging and movements of the 3D model show that the ball with a detent ridge slipped into a socket and over the socket ridge before snapping back at the groove edge. Our results give insight into the complex spring-latch systems that underpin ultra-fast movements in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Activity in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) is needed to encode fears acquired through contact with both innate sources of danger (i.e., things that are painful) and learned sources of danger (e.g., being threatened with a gun). However, within the BLA, the molecular processes required to consolidate the two types of fear are not the same: protein synthesis is needed to consolidate the first type of fear (so-called first-order fear) but not the latter (so-called second-order fear). The present study examined why first- and second-order fears differ in this respect. To do so, it used a range of conditioning protocols in rats and assessed the effects of a BLA infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, on fear to first- and second-order conditioned stimuli. The results revealed that the differential protein synthesis requirements for consolidation of first- and second-order fears reflect differences in what is learned in each case. Protein synthesis in the BLA is needed to consolidate fears that result from encoding of relations between stimuli in the environment (stimulus-stimulus associations, typical for first-order fear) but is not needed to consolidate fears that form when environmental stimuli associate directly with fear responses emitted by the animal (stimulus-response associations, typical for second-order fear). Thus, the substrates of Pavlovian fear conditioning in the BLA depend on the way that the environment impinges upon the animal. This is discussed with respect to theories of amygdala function in Pavlovian fear conditioning, and ways in which stimulus-response associations might be consolidated in the brain.",

    "abstract": "GDF15 is a circulating polypeptide associated with cellular stress, and recently linked to metabolic adaptation. GDF15 has a half-life of approximately 3 hours in and acts at the GFRAL receptor selectively expressed in the area postrema. To characterize the effects of sustained GFRAL agonism on food intake (FI) and body weight (BW), we developed a half-life extended analog of GDF15 (Compound H; CpdH) suitable for reduced dosing frequency and tested its effects in obese cynomolgus monkeys. Animals were treated once weekly for 12 weeks with 0.048, 0.16, or 1.6 mg/Kg of CpdH or with 0.02 mg/Kg of the long-acting GLP-1 analog dulaglutide as a positive control. FI was measured daily and BW was measured biweekly. Mechanism-based longitudinal exposure-response (E-R) modeling was performed to characterize the effects of CpdH and dulaglutide on FI and BW. The integrated novel model accounts for both acute, exposure-dependent effects of treatments to reduce FI and the compensatory changes in energy expenditure (EE) and FI that occur over time in response to weight loss. CpdH had approximately linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with a half-life of {approx}8 days and treatment with CpdH led to dose- and exposure-dependent reductions in FI and BW. The 1.6 mg/Kg CpdH dose reduced mean FI by 57.5% at 1 week and provided sustained FI reductions of 31.5% from weeks 9-12, leading to a peak reduction in BW of 16{+/-}5%. Dulaglutide had more modest effects on FI (reductions between 15-40%) and peak BW loss was 3.8{+/-}4.0%. Longitudinal modeling of both the FI and BW profiles suggested reductions in BW observed with both CpdH and dulaglutide were fully explained by the exposure-dependent reductions in FI without any increase in EE. Upon verification of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship established in monkeys and human for dulaglutide, we predicted that CpdH could reach double digit BW loss in human. In summary, treatment with a long-acting GDF15 analog led to sustained dose- and exposure-dependent reductions in food intake in a monkey model of obesity and holds potential for effective clinical obesity pharmacotherapy.\n\nSignificance StatementGDF15 activation of GFRAL receptors in the hindbrain controls food intake and body weight. Here we describe the effect and durability of a circulating half-life extended analog of GDF15 (Compound H) on food intake and body weight loss in a spontaneously obese cynomolgus monkey model. Inclusion of a translational treatment arm with a weight loss agent, dulaglutide, permitted pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and comparison of both GDF15 and GLP-1 based weight loss mechanisms, and development of an allometric scaling based mathematical model to estimate the efficacy of Compound H in human obese subjects.",

Computational models have revealed how local network structure and feedforward inputs control the trial-by-trial variability. However, the role of input statistics and different interneuron subtypes in shaping the trial-by-trial variability was less understood. Here we investigated the dynamics of stimulus response in a model of cortical microcircuit with one excitatory and three inhibitory interneuron populations (PV, SST, VIP). We show that the variance ratio of inputs to different neuron populations and input covariances are the main determinants of output trial-by-trial variability. The effect of input covariances is contingent on the input variance ratios. In general, the network shows smaller output trial-by-trial variability in a PV-dominated regime than in an SST-dominated regime. Our work reveals mechanisms by which output trial-by-trial variability can be controlled in a context, state, and task-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signaling molecule that participates in various signaling functions in health and diseases. The tetrameric cystathionine {gamma}-lyase (CSE) contributes to H2S biogenesis and several investigations provide evidence on the pharmacological modulation of CSE as a potential target for the treatment of a multitude of conditions. D-penicillamine (D-pen) has recently been reported to selectively impede CSE-catalyzed H2S production but the molecular bases for such inhibitory effect have not been investigated. In this study, we report that D-pen follows a mixed-inhibition mechanism to inhibit both cystathionine (CST) cleavage and H2S biogenesis by human CSE. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying such a mixed inhibition, we performed docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Interestingly, MD analysis of CST binding reveals a likely active site configuration prior to gem-diamine intermediate formation, particularly H-bond formation between the amino group of the substrate and the O3 of PLP. Similar analyses realized with both CST and D-pen identified three potent interfacial ligand-binding sites for D-pen and offered a rational for D-pen effect. Thus, inhibitor binding not only induces the creation of an entirely new interacting network at the vicinity of the interface between enzyme subunits, but it also exerts long range effects by propagating to the active site. Overall, our study paved the way for the design of new allosteric interfacial inhibitory compounds that will specifically modulate H2S biogenesis by cystathionine {gamma}-lyase.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519292v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6d57org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d3898forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ec1804org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ce3e9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Since this mechanism should affect GSK3{beta} activity towards all primed substrates, it is unclear why Ser9 phosphorylation does not affect other GSK3{beta}-dependent pathways, such as Wnt signaling. We used biochemical reconstitution and cell culture assays to evaluate how Wnt-associated GSK3{beta} is insulated from cross-activation by other signals. We found that the Wnt-specific scaffold protein Axin allosterically protects GSK3{beta} from phosphorylation at Ser9 by upstream kinases, which prevents accumulation of pS9-GSK3{beta} in the Axin-GSK3{beta} complex. Scaffold proteins that protect bound proteins from alternative pathway reactions could provide a general mechanism to insulate signaling pathways from improper crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Heme-containing integral membrane proteins are at the heart of many bioenergetic complexes and electron transport chains. The importance of these electron relay hubs across biology has inspired the design of de novo proteins that recreate their core features within robust, versatile and tractable protein folds. To this end, we report here the computational design and in-cell production of a minimal diheme membrane cytochrome which successfully integrates into the cellular membrane of live bacteria. This synthetic construct emulates a four-helix bundle found in modern respiratory complexes but has no sequence homology to any polypeptide sequence found in nature. The two b-type hemes, which appear to be recruited from the endogenous heme pool, have distinct split redox potentials with values close to those of natural membrane-spanning cytochromes. The purified protein can engage in rapid biomimetic electron transport with small molecules, with other redox proteins, and with biologically-relevant diffusive electron carriers. We thus report an artificial membrane metalloprotein with the potential to serve as a functional module in electron transfer pathways in both synthetic protocells and living systems.",

    "abstract": "The volume and the electric strength of an excitatory synapse is near linearly correlated with the area of its postsynaptic density (PSD). Extensive research in the past have revealed that the PSD assembly directly communicates with actin cytoskeleton in the spine to coordinate activity-induced spine volume enlargement as well as long-term stable spine structure maintenance. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the communication between the PSD assembly and spine actin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. In this study, we discover that in vitro reconstituted PSD condensates can promote actin polymerization and filamentous actin bundling without help of any actin regulatory proteins. The Homer scaffold within the PSD condensates and a positively charged actin binding surface of the Homer EVH1 domain are essential for the PSD condensate-induced actin bundle formation in vitro and for spine growth in neurons. Homer-induced actin bundling can only occur when Homer forms condensates with other PSD scaffold proteins such as Shank and SAPAP. The PSD-induced actin bundle formation is sensitively regulated by CaMKII or by the product of the immediate early gene Homer1a. Thus, the communication between PSD and spine cytoskeleton may be modulated by targeting the phase separation of the PSD condensates.",

    "abstract": "Oxalate-induced nephropathies comprise a range of kidney disorders, for which there are no efficient pharmacological treatments. Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is a derivative of citric acid with a variety of pharmacological activities including reducing body weight and calcium salt deposition. However, the specific mechanism of inhibition of oxalate nephropathies by this compound is not well understood. In this study, we successfully applied bioinformatics-based and simulated drug molecular docking approaches to predict potential targets of HCA. Subsequently, we explored the molecular mechanisms of HCA inhibition of renal calcium oxalate (CaOx) deposition and nephrotoxicity in an oxalate-induced NRK-52E cell model and an oxalate nephropathy rat model. HCA could effectively inhibit CaOx crystal deposition and reduce crystal adhesion and oxidative damage, effectively inhibit lipid deposition caused by high oxalate, and reduce lipid nephrotoxicity. HCA is more effective than traditional stone medications in inhibiting CaOx deposition and kidney damage. Further cellular transcriptomic analysis and in vitro results showed that HCA could stably bind peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) and promote PPAR-RXR heterodimer formation, thus promoting the expression of downstream oxidative stress molecules (Nrf2, HO-1, SOD) and inhibiting calcium ion release and mitochondrial dysfunction, thus reducing oxalate-induced renal lipid peroxidation damage. Therefore, HCA, a novel drug with the ability to modulate lipid metabolism and inhibit CaOx formation, may be a therapeutic option for the treatment of oxalate nephropathies.",

    "abstract": "Although several high-fidelity SpCas9 variants that have reduced activities at mismatched target sequences have been reported, it has been observed that this increased specificity is associated with reduced on-target activity, limiting the applications of the high-fidelity variants when efficient genome editing is required. Here, we developed an improved version of Sniper-Cas9, Sniper2L, which represents an exception to this trade-off trend as it showed higher specificity with retained high activity. We evaluated Sniper2L activities at a large number of target sequences, and developed DeepSniper, a deep-learning model that can predict the activity of Sniper2L. We also confirmed that Sniper2L can induce highly efficient and specific editing at a large number of target sequences when it is delivered as a ribonucleoprotein complex. Mechanically, the high specificity of Sniper2L originates from its superior ability to avoid unwinding a target DNA containing even a single mismatch. We envision that Sniper2L will be useful when efficient and specific genome editing is required.",

    "abstract": "Fusobacterium varium has been generally overlooked in cattle rumen microbiome studies relative to the presumably more abundant, liver abscess-causing Fusobacterium necrophorum. Here, we revisit that conventional wisdom and report greater relative abundance of F. varium than F. necrophorum in both raw rumen samples and in lactate-supplemented enrichments tailored for F. necrophorum growth, despite its consistent inadvertence in past ruminal surveys and putative inability to metabolize lactate. Our observation that F. varium grows under restrictive conditions used to enumerate F. necrophorum suggests that previous estimations were inaccurate and F. varium is an underestimated player within the ruminal community. Exposure to tylosin, the current gold standard among prophylactic liver abscess prevention strategies in cattle, consistently reduced growth of all F. necrophorum strains screened by greater than 67% relative to unexposed controls. In contrast, F. varium strains were completely or highly resistant (0 - 11% reduction in maximum yield). Monensin, an ionophore fed to cattle to improve feed efficiency also had stronger inhibitory activity against F. necrophorum than against F. varium. Finally, preliminary genomic analysis of two F. varium bovine isolates revealed the presence of virulence genes related to those of pathogenic F. varium human isolates associated with active invasion of mammalian cells.\n\nImportanceJudicious antibiotic use is essential to mitigate the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Dogmatic prophylactic use of in-feed tylosin to control cattle liver abscesses hinges on the assumption that F. necrophorum in the rumen is the main etiologic agent. However, our unexpected finding of abundance of F. varium in the rumen and its resistance to antibiotics, in hand with the potential pathogenicity of this species, calls for increased attention to F. varium. Further investigation into F. varium is necessary to better understand bovine liver abscess development and devise higher-precision alternatives to antibiotic treatment.",

    "abstract": "The microbial process denitrification is the primary source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) from terrestrial ecosystems. Fungal denitrifiers, unlike many bacteria, lack the N2O reductase and are potential sources of N2O. Still, their diversity, distribution, and environmental determinants in terrestrial ecosystems remain unresolved. We used a phylogenetically informed approach to screen 1 980 soil and rhizosphere metagenomes representing 608 globally distributed sampling sites for the denitrification marker gene nirK, coding for nitrite reductase. We show that fungal denitrifiers are sparse, yet cosmopolitan and dominated by saprotrophs and opportunistic plant pathogens. Few showed biome-specific distribution patterns. However, members of the Fusarium oxysporum species complex, known to produce substantial amounts of N2O, were proportionally more abundant and diverse in the rhizosphere than in other biomes. Fungal denitrifiers were most frequently detected in croplands but were most abundant in forest soils. The overall low abundance of fungal relative to bacterial and archaeal denitrifiers suggests that their role in denitrification and contribution to soil N2O emissions may be less important than previously suggested. Nevertheless, in relative terms, they could play a role in soils characterized by high carbon to nitrogen ratio and low pH, especially in tundra and boreal and temperate coniferous forests. Our results further indicate that plant-pathogen interactions may favor fungal denitrifiers. Thus, increasing global warming with predicted proliferation of pathogens and the fact that many of the fungi with nirK detected in the metagenomes are stress-tolerant cosmopolitans suggest that fungal denitrifier abundance may increase in terrestrial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Quinolinic carboxylic acids are known for their metal ion chelating properties in insects, plants and bacteria. The larval stages of the lepidopteran pest, Spodoptera littoralis, produce 8-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid (8-HQA) in high concentrations from tryptophan in the diet. At the same time, the larval midgut is known to harbor a bacterial population. The motivation behind the work was to investigate whether 8-HQA is controlling the bacterial community in the gut by regulating the concentration of metal ions. Knocking out the gene for kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) in the insect using CRISPR/Cas9 eliminated production of 8-HQA and significantly increased bacterial numbers and diversity in the larval midgut. Adding 8-HQA to the diet of knockout larvae caused a dose-dependent reduction of bacterial numbers with minimal effects on diversity. Enterococcus mundtii dominates the community in all treatments, probably due to its highly efficient iron uptake system and production of the colicin, mundticin. Thus host factors and bacterial properties interact to determine patterns of diversity and abundance in the insect midgut.",

    "abstract": "The application of microfluidic techniques in experimental and environmental studies is a rapidly emerging field. Water-in-oil microdroplets can serve readily as controllable micro-vessels for studies that require spatial structure. In many applications, it is useful to monitor cell growth without breaking or disrupting the microdroplets. To this end, optical reporters based on color, fluorescence, or luminescence have been developed. However, optical reporters suffer from limitations when used in microdroplets such as inaccurate readings due to strong background interference or limited sensitivity during early growth stages. In addition, optical detection is typically not amenable to filamentous or biofilm-producing organisms that have significant non-linear changes in opacity and light scattering during growth. To overcome such limitations, we show that volatile methyl halide gases produced by reporter cells expressing a methyl halide transferase (MHT) can serve as an alternative non-optical detection approach suitable for microdroplets. In this study, an MHT-labeled Streptomyces venezuelae reporter strain was constructed and characterized. Protocols were established for the encapsulation and incubation of S. venezuelae in microdroplets. We observed the complete life cycle for S. venezuelae including the vegetative expansion of mycelia, mycelial fragmentation, and late-stage sporulation. Methyl bromide (MeBr) production was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) from S. venezuelae gas reporters incubated in either liquid suspension or microdroplets and used to quantitatively estimate bacterial density. Overall, using MeBr production as a means of quantifying bacterial growth provided a 100-1000 fold increase in sensitivity over optical or fluorescence measurements of a comparable reporter strain expressing fluorescent proteins.\n\nImportanceQuantitative measurement of bacterial growth in microdroplets in situ is desirable but challenging. Current optical reporter systems suffer from limitations when applied to filamentous or biofilm-producing organisms. In this study, we demonstrate that volatile methyl halide gas production can serve as a quantitative non-optical growth assay for filamentous bacteria encapsulated in microdroplets. We constructed an S. venezuelae gas reporter strain and observed a complete life cycle for encapsulated S. venezuelae in microdroplets, establishing microdroplets as an alternative growth environment for Streptomyces spp. that can provide spatial structure. We detected MeBr production from both liquid suspension and microdroplets with a 100-1000 fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio compared to optical assays. Importantly, we could reliably detect bacteria with densities down to 106 CFU/mL. The combination of quantitative gas reporting and microdroplet systems provides a valuable approach to studying fastidious organisms that require spatial structure such as those found typically in soils.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519239v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f77645org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75b4b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ab4d47org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e8de5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The formation of multinucleated contractile myofibers from muscle stem cells during myogenesis is indispensable for skeletal muscle formation. Myogenesis is governed by myogenic regulatory transcription factors, including MYOD. However, very few MYOD- regulated effector proteins were shown to be sufficient to promote myogenesis. Here, we identified an unexpected role for the secreted matricellular protein ADAMTS-like 2 (ADAMTSL2) as a rheostat for Wnt signaling during myogenesis downstream of MYOD. ADAMTSL2 expression was induced during myoblast differentiation and ADAMTSL2 was required for myoblast differentiation. ADAMTSL2 ablation in myogenic precursor cells resulted in aberrant muscle architecture in vivo. The pro-myogenic ADAMTSL2 function was dependent on WNT ligands. Mechanistically, ADAMTSL2 potentiated WNT signaling by binding to WNT ligands and WNT receptors. Finally, we identified a WNT-binding ADAMTSL2 peptide that was sufficient to promote myogenesis. Since ADAMTSL2 was previously described as a negative regulator of TGF{beta} signaling in fibroblasts, ADAMTSL2 now emerges as a signaling node that could integrate and fine-tune WNT, TGF{beta} and potentially other signaling pathways within the dynamic microenvironment of differentiating myoblasts during skeletal muscle development and regeneration.",

During the last decade, a plethora of such tools have been developed, but a systematic comparison with orthogonal validation is missing. Here, we set up a circRNA detection tool benchmarking study, in which 16 tools were used and detected over 315,000 unique circRNAs in three deeply sequenced human cell types. Next, 1,516 predicted circRNAs were empirically validated using three orthogonal methods. Generally, tool-specific precision values are high and similar (median of 98.8%, 96.3%, and 95.5% for qPCR, RNase R, and amplicon sequencing, respectively) whereas the sensitivity and number of predicted circRNAs (ranging from 1,372 to 58,032) are the most significant tool differentiators. Furthermore, we demonstrate the complementarity of tools through the increase in detection sensitivity by considering the union of highly-precise tool combinations while keeping the number of false discoveries low. Finally, based on the benchmarking results, recommendations are put forward for circRNA detection and validation.",

    "abstract": "The metalloproteinase ovastacin is released by the mammalian egg upon fertilization and cleaves a distinct peptide bond in zona pellucida protein 2, a component of the enveloping extracellular matrix. This limited proteolysis causes zona pellucida hardening, abolishes sperm binding and thereby regulates fertility. Accordingly, this process is tightly controlled by the plasma protein fetuin-B, an endogenous competitive inhibitor. At present, little is known about how the cleavage characteristics of ovastacin differ from closely related proteases. Physiological implications of ovastacin beyond ZP2 cleavage are still obscure. In this study, we employed N-terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (N-TAILS) contained in the secretome of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to elucidate the substrate specificity and the precise cleavage site specificity. Furthermore, we were able to unravel the physicochemical properties governing enzyme-substrate interactions. Eventually, we identified several potential physiological substrates with significance for mammalian fertilization. These data suggest that ovastacin might regulate sperm-oocyte interaction and fertility beyond zona pellucida hardening.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519252v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (90K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b27cddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1239a3eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@638c37org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18a960f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Previous reports revealed that sodium dodecyl sulfate near its critical micelle concentration can drive the assembly of A{beta}42 along an oligomeric pathway. This pathway produces a 150 kDa peptide oligomer (approximately 32 peptide molecules or protomers) that does not aggregate further into amyloid fibrils. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed structural features distinguishing the 150 kDa oligomer from fibrils. A puzzling feature was the coexistence of parallel and antiparallel {beta}-sheets within the oligomer structure. Here we present new atomic-level structural constraints obtained via solid-state NMR spectroscopy, benefitting from improved resolution via sample concentration by ultracentrifugation. In addition, two-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction revealed a 4-fold symmetric shape. We propose a structural model to rationalize the solid-sate NMR- and cryo-EM-derived structural constraints. This model has a hollow square cylinder shape, with antiparallel {beta}-sheets formed by residues 33-39 lining the inner walls and parallel {beta}-sheets formed by residues 11-22 lining the outer walls. Within successive layers, the outer {beta}-strands on each side of the square cylinder alternate between two forms: one within a U-shaped protomer and another within L-shaped protomer. Molecular dynamics simulations show that, when the oligomer model is embedded in a lipid membrane, ions permeate through the central pore, with cation selectivity. The model further motivates an assembly pathway-based interpretation that may explain why the 150 kDa oligomer does not undergo further aggregation into amyloid fibrils.\n\nSignificance StatementA{beta} oligomers are thought to be the most toxic species in Alzheimers disease. Their sizes range from 2 to [~]50 protomers. Most published experimental data on A{beta} oligomers indicate that they, like fibrils, are composed of {beta}-sheets, but it is a mystery why any {beta}-sheet aggregate would exist as a stable oligomer without undergoing further aggregation into fibrils. Here, structural constraints from solid-state NMR and cryo-EM led us to an oligomer model with a hollow square cylinder shape capable of conducting ions when embedded in a lipid membrane. Based on the model, we argue that geometric frustration may distinguish the assembly pathway that produces this oligomer from fibril-forming assembly pathways.",

    "abstract": "Cellular plasminogen (Pg) receptors (PgR) are utilized to recruit Pg, stimulate its activation to the serine protease, plasmin (Pm), and sterically protect the generated Pm from inactivation by natural host inhibitors. The net result is that cells contain a stable proteolytic surface used for biological mechanisms involved in cell migration. One such PgR is the moonlighting enzyme, enolase, some of which leaves the cytoplasm and resides at the cell surface to potentially function as a PgR. Since microbes employ conscription of host Pg by PgRs as one virulence mechanism, we explored the structural basis of the ability of Streptococcus pyogenes enolase (Sen) to function in this regard. Employing single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), recombinant Sen from S. pyogenes was modeled at 2.6 [A] as a stable symmetrical homooctamer displaying point group 422 (D4) symmetry, with a monomeric subunit molecular weight of ~49 kDa. Subunit-subunit interactions showed four major and four minor interfaces in the octamer. Binding sites for hPg were previously proposed to include the COOH-terminal K434,435 residues of Sen, but in native Sen these residues are buried within the minor interfaces of the octamer and do not function as a Pg binding epitope. Whereas Sen and hPg do not interact in solution, when Sen is bound to a surface, hPg interacts with Sen independently of K434,434. We propose that the octameric structure of Sen is important to its ability to interact with hPg, but disruption of its overall octameric conformation without dissociation of the octamer exposes neoepitopes for hPg binding.",

    "abstract": "Cholestatic itch is a severe and debilitating symptom in liver diseases with limited treatment options. The class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Mas-related GPCR subtype X4 (MRGPRX4) has been identified as a receptor for bile acids, which are potential cholestatic pruritogens. An increasing number of GPCRs have been shown to interact with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), which can modulate different aspects of GPCR biology. Using a combination of multiplexed immunoassay and proximity ligation assay we show that MRGPRX4 interacts with RAMPs. The interaction of MRGPRX4 with RAMP2, but not RAMP1 or 3, causes attenuation of basal and agonist-dependent signaling, which correlates with a decrease of MRGPRX4 cell surface expression as measured using a quantitative NanoBRET pulse-chase assay. Finally, we use AlphaFold Multimer to predict the structure of the MRGPRX4-RAMP2 complex. The discovery that RAMP2 regulates MRGPRX4 may have direct implications for future drug development for cholestatic itch.",

    "abstract": "Advances in DNA sequencing and machine learning are illuminating protein sequences and structures on an enormous scale. However, the energetics driving folding are invisible in these structures and remain largely unknown. The hidden thermodynamics of folding can drive disease, shape protein evolution, and guide protein engineering, and new approaches are needed to reveal these thermodynamics for every sequence and structure. We present cDNA display proteolysis, a new method for measuring thermodynamic folding stability for up to 900,000 protein domains in a one-week experiment. From 1.8 million measurements in total, we curated a set of ~850,000 high-quality folding stabilities covering all single amino acid variants and selected double mutants of 354 natural and 188 de novo designed protein domains 40-72 amino acids in length. Using this immense dataset, we quantified (1) environmental factors influencing amino acid fitness, (2) thermodynamic couplings (including unexpected interactions) between protein sites, and (3) the global divergence between evolutionary amino acid usage and protein folding stability. We also examined how our approach could identify stability determinants in designed proteins and evaluate design methods. The cDNA display proteolysis method is fast, accurate, and uniquely scalable, and promises to reveal the quantitative rules for how amino acid sequences encode folding stability.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryMassively parallel measurement of protein folding stability by cDNA display proteolysis",

Mmm survived and proliferated extracellularly on bovine macrophage cell layers in the absence of Mmm-specific antisera. Bovine complement used at non-bactericidal concentrations did neither have opsonizing effect nor promoted intracellular survival, whereas Mmm-specific antisera substantially increased phagocytosis and Mmm killing. A phagocytosis-independent uptake of Mmm by macrophages occurred at high MOIs, also found to induce the production of TNF, and both responses were unaffected by non-bactericidal doses of bovine complement. Bovine complement used at higher doses killed Mmm in cell-free cultures and completely abrogated TNF responses by macrophages.

Tr1 cells were dependent on IL-27R and in their absence recovery from IAV-induced weight loss is impaired. Notably, these Tr1 cells did not necessarily co-express the typical Tr1 markers LAG-3 and CD49b, with four distinct populations of Tr1 cells apparent in the lungs. Each population was suppressive and were differentially dependent on IL-10 to mediate suppression. Transcriptional analysis revealed a core Tr1 gene signature in each population and distinct expression profiles indicative of different states of activation and differentiation.

Here, we report intrinsic and extant kinetics as well as genome-resolved community characterization of a full-scale integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) system where comammox and anammox bacteria co-occur and appear to drive nitrogen loss. Intrinsic batch kinetic assays indicated that majority of the aerobic ammonia oxidation was driven by comammox bacteria (1.75 {+/-} 0.08 mg-N/g TS-h) in the attached growth phase with minimal contribution by ammonia oxidizing bacteria. Interestingly, a portion of total inorganic nitrogen ([~]8%) was consistently lost during these aerobic assays. Aerobic nitrite oxidation assays eliminated the possibility of denitrification as a cause of nitrogen loss, while anaerobic ammonia oxidation assays resulted in rates consistent with anammox stoichiometry. Full-scale experiments at different dissolved oxygen (DO = 2-6 mg/L) set points indicated persistent nitrogen loss that was partly sensitive to DO concentrations. Genome-resolved metagenomics confirmed high abundance (relative abundance 6.53 {+/-} 0.34%) of two Brocadia-like anammox populations while comammox bacteria within the Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa cluster were lower in abundance (0.37% {+/-} 0.03%) and Nitrosomonas-like ammonia oxidizers even lower (0.12% {+/-} 0.02%). Collectively, our study reports for the first time the co-occurrence and co-operation of comammox and anammox bacteria in a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment system.\n\nSynopsisComammox and anammox cooperation resulted in dissolved oxygen concentration dependent nitrogen loss in municipal wastewater treatment system.",

Here, we found that TGM2 additionally functions as an \"eraser\" of H3 monoaminylations that is capable of \"re-writing\" these epigenetic marks in cells, including a new class of this modification, H3Q5 histaminylation(his), which displays dynamic diurnal expression in brain and contributes to neural rhythmicity. We found that H3Q5his inhibits binding of the MLL1 complex to the H3 N-terminus and attenuates its methyltransferase activity on H3 lysine(K) 4. We determined that H3Q5 monoaminylation dynamics are dictated by local monoamine concentrations, which are utilized by TGM2.

    "abstract": "With the advent of rapid automated in silico identification of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), genomics presents vast opportunities to accelerate natural product (NP) discovery. However, prolific NP producers, Streptomyces, are exceptionally GC-rich (>80%) and highly repetitive within BGCs. These pose challenges in sequencing and high-quality genome assembly which are currently circumvented via intensive sequencing. Here, we outline a more cost-effective workflow using multiplex Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing with hybrid long-short read assembly algorithms to generate high quality genomes. Our protocol involves subjecting long read-derived assemblies to up to 4 rounds of polishing with short reads to yield accurate BGC predictions. We successfully sequenced and assembled 8 GC-rich Streptomyces genomes whose lengths range from 7.1 to 12.1 Mb at an average N50 of 5.9 Mb. Taxonomic analysis revealed previous misrepresentation among these strains and allowed us to propose a potentially new species, Streptomyces sydneybrenneri. Further comprehensive characterization of their biosynthetic, pan-genomic and antibiotic resistance features especially for molecules derived from type I polyketide synthase (PKS) BGCs reflected their potential as NP chassis. Thus, the genome assemblies and insights presented here are envisioned to serve as gateway for the scientific community to expand their avenues in NP discovery.\n\nGraphic abstractSchematic of hybrid long- and short read assembly workflow for genome sequencing of GC-rich Streptomyces.
