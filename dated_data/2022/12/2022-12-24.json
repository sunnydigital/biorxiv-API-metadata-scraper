    "abstract": "Central to T cell biology, the T cell receptor (TCR) integrates forces in its triggering process upon interaction with peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)1-3. Phenotypically, forces elicit TCR catch-slip bonds with strong pMHCs but slip-only bonds with weak pMHCs4-10. While such correlation is commonly observed, the quantitative bond pattern and degree of \"catchiness\" vary. We developed two models based on the structure, elastic properties, and force-induced conformational changes of the TCR-pMHC-I/II complexes to derive from their bond characteristics more intrinsic parameters that underlie structural mechanisms, predict T cell signaling, and discriminate antigens. Applying the models to 55 datasets of 12 {beta}TCRs and their mutants interacting with corresponding pMHCs without coreceptor engagement demonstrated the ability for structural and physical parameters to quantitatively integrate and classify a broad range of bond behaviors and biological activities. Comparing to the generic two-state model for catch-slip bond that also fits the data, our models can distinguish class I from class II MHC systems and their best-fit parameters correlate with the TCR/pMHC potency to trigger T cell activation, which the generic model cannot. The models were tested by mutagenesis using structural analysis, bond profile measurement, and functional assay of a MHC and a TCR mutated to alter conformation changes. The extensive comparisons between theory and experiment provided strong validation of the models and testable hypothesis regarding specific conformational changes that control bond profiles, thereby suggesting structural mechanisms for the inner workings of the TCR mechanosensing machinery and plausible explanation of why and how force may amplify TCR signaling and antigen discrimination.",

    "abstract": "The locus cruleus (LC) is the primary source of noradrenergic projections to the forebrain, and, in prefrontal cortex, is implicated in decision-making and executive function. LC neurons phase-lock to cortical infra-slow wave oscillations during sleep. Such infra-slow rhythms are rarely reported in awake states, despite their interest, since they correspond to the time scale of behavior. Thus, we investigated LC neuronal synchrony with infra-slow rhythms in awake rats performing an attentional set-shifting task. Local field potential (LFP) oscillation cycles in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus on the order of 0.4 Hz phase-locked to task events at crucial maze locations. Indeed, successive cycles of the infra-slow rhythms showed different wavelengths, as if they are periodic oscillations that can reset phase relative to salient events.\n\nSimultaneously recorded infra-slow rhythms in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus could show different cycle durations as well suggesting independent control. Most LC neurons (including optogenetically identified noradrenergic neurons) recorded here were phase-locked to these infra-slow rhythms, as were hippocampal and prefrontal units recorded on the LFP probes. The infra-slow oscillations also phase-modulated gamma amplitude, linking these rhythms at the time scale of behavior to those coordinating neuronal synchrony. This would provide a potential mechanism where noradrenaline, released by LC neurons in concert with the infra-slow rhythm, would facilitate synchronization or reset of these brain networks, underlying behavioral adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The naked mole-rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber) is of significant interest to biogerontological research, rarely developing age-associated diseases, such as cancer. The transmembrane glycoprotein CD44 is upregulated in certain cancers and CD44 cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) regulates cellular migration. Here we provide evidence that mature ADAM10 is expressed in NMR primary skin fibroblasts (NPSF), and that ionomycin increases cell surface ADAM10 localization. However, we observed an absence of ADAM10 mediated CD44 cleavage, as well as shedding of exogenous and overexpressed betacellulin in NPSF, whereas in mouse primary skin fibroblasts (MPSF) ionomycin induced ADAM10-dependent cleavage of both CD44 and betacellulin. Overexpressing a hyperactive form of the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scramblase ANO6 in NPSF increased phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, which rescued the ADAM10 sheddase activity and promoted wound closure in NPSF in an ADAM10-dependent manner. These findings suggest that dysregulation of ADAM10 shedding activity is due to a deficient PS externalization in NMR.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionDance-based therapies are an emerging form of movement therapy aiming to improve motor and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairments (MCIs). Despite promising effects of dance-based therapies on function, it remains unclear how age-related declines in motor and cognitive function affect movement capacity and influence which movements and rhythms maximize dance therapy efficacy. Here, we evaluated the effects of age and MCI on the ability to accurately modulate spatial (i.e., joint kinematics), temporal (i.e., step timing), and spatiotemporal features of gait to achieve spatial and temporal targets during walking.\n\nMethodsWe developed novel rhythmic movement sequences - nine spatial, nine temporal, and four spatiotemporal - that deviated from typical spatial and temporal features of walking. Healthy young adults (HYA), healthy older adults (HOA), and adults with MCI were trained on each gait modification before performing the modification overground, with kinematic data recorded using wearable sensors.\n\nResultsHOA performed spatial (p = 0.010) and spatiotemporal (p = 0.048) gait modifications less accurately than HYA. Individuals with MCI performed spatiotemporal gait modifications less accurately than HOA (p = 0.017). Spatial modifications to the swing phase of gait (p = 0.006, Cohens d = -1.3), and four- and six-step Duple rhythms during temporal modifications (p < 0.030, Cohens d > 0.9) elicited the largest differences in gait performance in HYA vs. HOA and HOA vs. MCI, respectively.\n\nDiscussionThese findings suggest that age-related declines in strength and balance reduce the ability to accurately modulate spatial gait features, while declines in working memory in individuals with MCI may reduce the ability to perform longer temporal gait modification sequences.\n\nDifferences in rhythmic movement sequence performance highlight motor and cognitive factors potentially underlying deficits in gait modulation capacity, which may guide therapy personalization and provide more sensitive indices to track intervention efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Despite being unpredictable and uncertain, reward environments often exhibit certain regularities, and animals navigating these environments try to detect and utilize such regularities to adapt their behavior. However, successful learning requires that animals also adjust to uncertainty associated with those regularities. Here, we analyzed choice data from two comparable dynamic foraging tasks in mice and monkeys to investigate mechanisms underlying adjustments to different types of uncertainty. In these tasks, animals selected between two choice options that delivered reward probabilistically, while baseline reward probabilities changed after a variable number (block) of trials without any cues to the animals. To measure adjustments in behavior, we applied multiple metrics based on information theory that quantify consistency in behavior, and fit choice data using reinforcement learning models. We found that in both species, learning and choice were affected by uncertainty about reward outcomes (in terms of determining the better option) and by expectation about when the environment may change. However, these effects were mediated through different mechanisms. First, more uncertainty about the better option resulted in slower learning and forgetting in mice, whereas it had no significant effect in monkeys. Second, expectation of block switches accompanied slower learning, faster forgetting, and increased stochasticity in choice in mice, whereas it only reduced learning rates in monkeys. Overall, while demonstrating the usefulness of entropy-based metrics in studying adaptive behavior, our study provides evidence for multiple types of adjustments in learning and choice behavior according to uncertainty in the reward environment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1; SLC19a1) is the main responsible transporter for the B9 family of vitamins named folates, which are essential for normal tissue growth and development. While folate deficiency resulted in retinal vasculopathy, the expression and the role of RFC1 in blood-retinal barrier (BRB) are not well known.\n\nMethodsWe used whole mount retinas and trypsin digested microvessel samples of adult mice. To knockdown RFC1, we delivered RFC1-targeted short interfering RNA (RFC1-siRNA) intravitreally; while, to upregulate RFC1 we delivered lentiviral vector overexpressing RFC1. Retinal ischemia was induced 1-hour by applying FeCl3 to central retinal artery. We used RT-qPCR and Western blotting to determine RFC1. Endothelium (CD31), pericytes (PDGFR-beta, CD13, NG2), tight-junctions (Occludin, Claudin-5 and ZO-1), main basal membrane protein (Collagen-4), endogenous IgG and RFC1 were determined immunohistochemically.\n\nResultsOur analyses on whole mount retinas and trypsin digested microvessel samples of adult mice revealed the presence of RFC1 in the inner BRB and colocalization with endothelial cells and pericytes. Knocking down RFC1 expression via siRNA delivery resulted in the disintegration of tight junction proteins and collagen-4 in twenty-four hours, which was accompanied by significant endogenous IgG extravasation. This indicated the impairment of BRB integrity after an abrupt RFC1 decrease. Furthermore, lentiviral vector-mediated RFC1 overexpression resulted in increased tight junction proteins and collagen-4, confirming the structural role of RFC1 in the inner BRB. Acute retinal ischemia decreased collagen-4 and occludin levels and led to an increase in RFC1. Besides, the pre-ischemic overexpression of RFC1 partially rescued collagen-4 and occludin levels which would be decreased after ischemia.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, our study clarifies the presence of RFC1 protein in the inner BRB, which has recently been defined as hypoxia-immune-related gene in other tissues and offers a novel perspective of retinal RFC1. Hence, other than being a folate carrier, RFC1 is an acute regulator of the inner BRB in healthy and ischemic retinas.",

    "abstract": "The capacity for autonomous behaviour is key to human intelligence, and fundamental to modern social life. However, experimental investigations of the cognitive bases of human autonomy are challenging, because experimental paradigms typically constrain behaviour using controlled contexts, and elicit behaviour by external triggers. In contrast, autonomy and freedom imply unconstrained behaviour initiated by endogenous triggers. Here we propose a new theoretical construct of adaptive autonomy, meaning the capacity to make behavioural choices that are free from constraints of both immediate external triggers and of routine response patterns, but nevertheless show appropriate coordination with the environment. Participants (N = 152) played a competitive game in which they had to choose the right time to act, in the face of an opponent who punished (in separate blocks) either choice biases (such as always responding early), sequential patterns of action timing across trials (such as early, late, early, late...), or predictable action-outcome dependence (such as win-stay, lose-shift). Adaptive autonomy was quantified as the ability to maintain performance when each of these influences on action selection was punished. We found that participants could become free from habitual choices regarding when to act and could also become free from sequential action patterns. However, they were not able to free themselves from influences of action-outcome dependence, even when these resulted in poor performance. These results point to a new concept of autonomous behaviour as flexible adaptation of voluntary action choice under different classes of internal constraint.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput genotyping enables the large-scale analysis of genetic diversity in population genomics and genomewide association studies that combine the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of large collections of accessions. Sequencing-based approaches for genotyping are progressively replacing traditional genotyping methods due to the lower ascertainment bias. However, genome-wide genotyping based on sequencing becomes expensive in species with large genomes and a high proportion of repetitive DNA. Here we describe the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete repetitive elements in the 3.76-Gb genome of lentil (Lens culinaris), 84% consisting of repeats, thus concentrating the sequencing data on coding and regulatory regions (single-copy regions). We designed a custom set of 566,766 gRNAs targeting 2.9 Gbp of repeats and excluding repetitive regions overlapping annotated genes and putative regulatory elements based on ATAC-Seq data. The novel depletion method removed [~]40% of reads mapping to repeats, increasing those mapping to single-copy regions by [~]2.6-fold. When analyzing 25 million fragments, this repeat-to-single-copy shift in the sequencing data increased the number of genotyped bases of [~]10-fold compared to non-depleted libraries. In the same condition, we were also able to identify [~]12-fold more genetic variants in the single-copy regions and increased the genotyping accuracy by rescuing thousands of heterozygous variants that otherwise would be missed due to low coverage. The method performed similarly regardless of the multiplexing level, type of library or genotypes, including different cultivars and a closely-related species (L. orientalis). Our results demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-driven repeat depletion focuses sequencing data on meaningful genomic regions, thus improving high-density and genome-wide genotyping in large and repetitive genomes.",

    "abstract": "To replicate inside human macrophages and cause the disease tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) must scavenge a variety of nutrients from the host1,2. The Mammalian Cell Entry (MCE) proteins are important virulence factors in Mtb1,3, where they are encoded in large gene clusters and have been implicated in the transport of fatty acids4-7 and cholesterol1,4,8 across the impermeable mycobacterial cell envelope. Very little is known about how cargos are transported across this barrier, and how the ~10 proteins encoded in a mycobacterial mce gene cluster might assemble to transport cargo across the cell envelope remains unknown. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the endogenous Mce1 fatty acid import machine from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-pathogenic relative of Mtb. The structure reveals how the proteins of the Mce1 system assemble to form an elongated ABC transporter complex, long enough to span the cell envelope. The Mce1 complex is dominated by a curved, needle-like domain that appears to be unrelated to previously described protein structures, and creates a protected hydrophobic pathway for lipid transport across the periplasm. Unexpectedly, our structural data revealed the presence of a previously unknown subunit of the Mce1 complex, which we identified using a combination of cryo-EM and AlphaFold2, and name LucB. Our data lead to a structural model for Mce1-mediated fatty acid import across the mycobacterial cell envelope.",

There are classes of proteins though, such as antibodies, that are structurally unique, where the general solution still lacks. In particular, the prediction of the CDR-H3 loop, which is an instrumental part of an antibody in its antigen recognition abilities, remains a challenge. Antibody-specific deep learning frameworks were proposed to tackle this problem noting great progress, both on accuracy and speed fronts. Oftentimes though, the original networks produce physically implausible bond geometries that then need to undergo a time-consuming energy minimization process. Here we hypothesized that pre-training the network on a large, augmented set of models with correct physical geometries, rather than a small set of real antibody X-ray structures, would allow the network to learn better bond geometries. We show that fine-tuning such a pre-trained network on a task of shape prediction on real X-ray structures improves the number of correct peptide bond distances. We further demonstrate that pre-training allows the network to produce physically plausible shapes on an artificial set of CDR-H3s, showing the ability to generalize to the vast antibody sequence space. We hope that our strategy will benefit the development of deep learning antibody models that rapidly generate physically plausible geometries, without the burden of time-consuming energy minimization.",

    "abstract": "Chemical sensing via olfaction constitutes a most ancient form of inter-organism communication. But acoustical signaling via tonal and rhythmic patterning is also common among higher vertebrates. Animals that live in well ventilated habitats and move in diasporic ways have further evolved more spectrally varied and discretized call structure. But unlike song in birds, researchers have struggled to locate isolated nucleii specialized for music cognition. The brain stem, midbrain, hindbrain, and forebrain, however, all largely associate with aspects of musical performance, perception, memory, and emotion. I hypothesized that spectral features of musical display evolved as honest signals of spatial cognition for precarious locomotor tasks associated with nurturing and protecting vulnerable offspring. I investigated possible connections between motor, visual, and spatial cognitive areas in relation to both signaler production and receiver processing of acoustical features of musical output. Brain component volume fractions of 42 parts from 48 primates were compiled, from a single source, and compared against a vocal complexity index (ARDI) as well as individual musical feature scores: including tone, interval, repetition, transposition rhythm, and unique syllable count. Structures for spatial and visual perception as well as motor control and emotional processing associated moderately with areas used by species who produce calls with both temporal and spectral musical features. These findings are consistent with a dual (both receiver- and signaler-side) function of musical signals. Associations with spatio-social areas (e.g. schizocortex and insula) support direct selection for a paralimbic-based neighbor orienting [PIANO] sensory modality for mapping and anticipating movement of fellow arboreal cohabitants. Associations with motor areas (e.g. LGN, mid-brain, and thalamus) support the complementary model that signaler capacities for spatio-motive emplacement [ME] are indirectly selected by conspecific receivers. This dual manifestation in low-parity species that locomote in diasporic ways through (arboreally) diffuse habitats, is compatible with musicality serving as courtship signals by long-term mates with consistent and reliable spatial capacities directly relevant to care of vulnerable (arboreal) offspring.",

    "abstract": "How memories are used by the brain to guide future action is poorly understood. In olfactory associative learning in Drosophila, multiple compartments of the mushroom body act in parallel to assign valence to a stimulus. Here, we show that appetitive memories stored in different compartments induce different levels of upwind locomotion. Using a photoactivation screen of a new collection of split-GAL4 drivers and EM connectomics, we identified a cluster of neurons postsynaptic to the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that can trigger robust upwind steering. These UpWind Neurons (UpWiNs) integrate inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs from MBONs of appetitive and aversive memory compartments, respectively. After training, disinhibition from the appetitive-memory MBONs enhances the response of UpWiNs to reward-predicting odors. Blocking UpWiNs impaired appetitive memory and reduced upwind locomotion during retrieval. Photoactivation of UpWiNs also increased the chance of returning to a location where activation was initiated, suggesting an additional role in olfactory navigation. Thus, our results provide insight into how learned abstract valences are gradually transformed into concrete memory-driven actions through divergent and convergent networks, a neuronal architecture that is commonly found in the vertebrate and invertebrate brains.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to profile the transcriptome of teeth and the surrounding tissues of an adult lizard dentition (Eublepharis macularius) that is actively replacing teeth throughout life. Bulk RNAseq was used to compare teeth that are in function versus unerupted, developing teeth and single cell RNA-seq was carried out on jaw segments containing the dental forming tissues. In bulk RNAseq data, we found that functional teeth expressed genes involved in bone and tooth resorption. Indeed, multinucleated odontoclasts were abundant in tissue sections of functional teeth undergoing resorption. Unexpectedly, chemotaxis gene SEMA3A was expressed within odontoblasts and in adjacent mesenchyme, confirmed using RNAscope. Semaphorins may be involved in regulating odontoclasts during tooth resorption. The scRNA-seq experiment successfully isolated dental mesenchyme and epithelial cells. We confirmed that some of these genes are expressed in the earliest tooth buds within the tooth forming field. In addition, we found evidence of convergent evolution in the tooth eruption trait. Geckos evolved a means for second generation teeth to communicate with the functional teeth. Instead of a dental follicle inducing an eruption pathway as in the mammal, the gecko and other squamate reptiles use the enamel organ of the successional teeth to trigger tooth resorption of the functional teeth, thus creating an eruption pathway. New molecules such as SEMA3A and SFRP2 may also participate in this process. Future studies on the gecko will uncover the molecular basis of convergent evolution in the dentition.",

    "abstract": "Together with bacteria and fungi, yeasts actively take part in the global carbon cycle. Over a hundred yeast species have been shown to grow on the major plant polysaccharide xylan, which requires an arsenal of carbohydrate active enzymes. However, which enzymatic strategies yeasts use to deconstruct xylan and what specific biological roles they play in its conversion remain unclear. In fact, genome analyses reveal that many xylan-metabolizing yeasts lack expected xylanolytic enzymes. Guided by bioinformatics, we have here selected three xylan-metabolizing ascomycetous yeasts for in-depth characterization of growth behavior and xylanolytic enzymes. The savanna soil yeast Blastobotrys mokoenaii displays superior growth on xylan thanks to an efficient secreted glycoside hydrolase family 11 (GH11) xylanase; solving its crystal structure revealed a high similarity to xylanases from filamentous fungi. The termite gut-associated Scheffersomyces lignosus in contrast grows more slowly and its xylanase activity was found to be mainly cell surface-associated. The wood-isolated Wickerhamomyces canadensis surprisingly could not utilize xylan as the sole carbon source without adding xylooligosaccharides, exogenous xylanases or even by co-culturing with B. mokoenaii, suggesting that W. canadensis relies on initial xylan hydrolysis by neighboring cells. Furthermore, our characterization of a novel W. canadensis GH5 subfamily 49 (GH5_49) xylanase represents the first demonstrated activity in this subfamily. Our collective results provide new information on the variable xylanolytic systems evolved by yeasts and their potential roles in natural carbohydrate conversion.\n\nImportanceMicrobes that take part in the degradation of the polysaccharide xylan, the major hemicellulose component in plant biomass, are equipped with specialized enzyme machineries to hydrolyze the polymer into monosaccharides for further metabolism. However, despite being found in virtually every habitat, little is known of how yeasts break down and metabolize xylan and what biological role they may play in its turnover in nature. Here, we have explored the enzymatic xylan deconstruction strategies of three underexplored yeasts from diverse environments: Blastobotrys mokoenaii from soil, Scheffersomyces lignosus from insect guts and Wickerhamomyces canadensis from trees, and show that each species has a distinct behavior regarding xylan conversion. These findings may be of high relevance for future design and development of microbial cell factories and biorefineries utilizing renewable plant biomass.",

Several imaging studies have indicated substantial white matter (WM) defects in patients with DM1. Here, we performed RNA-sequencing and analysis of CTG repeat lengths in the frontal lobe of patients with DM1, separating the grey matter (GM) and WM, to investigate the splicing abnormalities in the DM1 brain, especially in the WM. The results demonstrated the number of repeats in the GM tended to be increase, with several genes showing similar levels of splicing abnormalities in the GM and WM, suggesting that the WM defects in DM1 are not only caused by aberrant splicing of GM RNA but also of WM RNA, which could be attributed to abnormal splicing of glial cell RNAs.",

Aberrant alteration in modulation of E2/ER signaling pathway has emerged as the putative contributor for endocrine resistance in BCa. Thus, identification the efficient ER cofactor remains necessary for finding a potential therapeutic target for endocrine resistance. Herein, we have demonstrated that Myb like, SWIRM and MPN domains 1 (MYSM1) as a histone deubiquitinase is a novel ER co-activator with established Drosophila experimental model. Our results showed that MYSM1 participated in up-regulation of ER action via histone and non-histone deubiquitination. We provided the evidence to show that MYSM1 was involved in maintenance of ER stability via ER deubiquitination. Furthermore, silencing MYSM1 induced enhancement of histone H2A ubiquitination as well as reduction of histone H3K4me3 and H3Ac levels at cis regulatory elements on promoter of ER-regulated gene. In addition, MYSM1 depletion attenuated cell proliferation/growth in BCa-derived cell lines and xenograft models. Knockdown of MYSM1 increased the sensitivity of antiestrogen agents in BCa cells. MYSM1 was highly expressed in clinical BCa samples, especially in aromatase inhibitor (AI) non-responsive tissues. These findings clarify the molecular mechanism of MYSM1 as an epigenetic modifier in regulation of ER action and provide a potential therapeutic target for endocrine resistance in BCa.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiomyopathy is a common disease of cardiac muscle that negatively affects cardiac function. HDAC3 commonly functions as co-repressor by removing acetyl moieties from histone tails. However, a deacetylase-independent role of HDAC3 has also been described. Cardiac deletion of HDAC3 causes reduced cardiac contractility accompanied by lipid accumulation. The molecular function of HDAC3 in cardiomyopathy remains unknown. We have used the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to investigate the enzymatic and non-enzymatic roles of HDAC3 in cardiomyopathy.\n\nMethods and ResultsUsing the Drosophila heart model, we showed that cardiac-specific HDAC3 knockdown leads to prolonged systoles and reduced cardiac contractility. Immunohistochemistry revealed structural abnormalities characterized by myofiber disruption in HDAC3 knock down hearts. Cardiac-specific HDAC3 knockdown showed increased levels of whole body triglycerides and increased fibrosis. The introduction of deacetylase-dead HDAC3 mutant in HDAC3 KD background showed comparable results with wild type HDAC3 in aspects of contractility and Pericardin deposition. However, deacetylase-dead HDAC3 mutants failed to improve triglyceride accumulation.\n\nConclusionsOur data indicate that HDAC3 plays a deacetylase-independent role in maintaining cardiac contractility and preventing Pericardin deposition as well as a deacetylase-dependent role to maintain triglyceride homestasis.",

However, the effect of OT on the association between social behavior and brain functional connectivity (FC) is yet to be comprehensively explored. In this study, using a face-perception task and multiple connectome-based predictive (CPM) models, we aimed to: 1) determine whether OT could enhance the association between task behavioral performance, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), and task-state functional connectivity (tsFC), and 2) if so, determine the role of OT in enhancing this triangular association. We found that both rsFC and tsFC could independently and significantly predict task performance in the OT group, but not in the placebo (PL) group. In addition, the correlation coefficient between rsFC and tsFC was substantially higher in the OT group than in the PL group. The strength of these associations could be partly explained by OT altering the brains FCs related to social cognition and face-perception in both resting and task states, mainly in brain regions such as the limbic system, prefrontal cortex (PFC), temporal poles (TP), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Together, these results suggest that neuropeptides can increase the consistency of individual differences in different modalities (e.g., behavioral and brain level data).",

    "abstract": "Brain-machine interfaces have reached an unprecedented capacity to measure and drive activity in the brain, allowing restoration of impaired sensory, cognitive or motor function. Classical control theory is pushed to its limit when aiming to design control laws that are suitable for large-scale, complex neural systems. This work proposes a scalable, data-driven, unified approach to study brain-machine-environment interaction using established tools from dynamical systems, optimal control theory, and deep learning. To unify the methodology, we define the environment, neural system, and prosthesis in terms of differential equations with learnable parameters, which effectively reduce to recurrent neural networks in the discrete-time case. Drawing on tools from optimal control, we describe three ways to train the system: Direct optimization of an objective function, oracle-based learning, and reinforcement learning. These approaches are adapted to different assumptions about knowledge of system equations, linearity, differentiability, and observability. We apply the proposed framework to train an in-silico neural system to perform tasks in a linear and a nonlinear environment, namely particle stabilization and pole balancing. After training, this model is perturbed to simulate impairment of sensor and motor function. We show how a prosthetic controller can be trained to restore the behavior of the neural system under increasing levels of perturbation. We expect that the proposed framework will enable rapid and flexible synthesis of control algorithms for neural prostheses that reduce the need for in-vivo testing. We further highlight implications for sparse placement of prosthetic sensor and actuator components.",

A current need exists for developing new technological solutions for obtaining highly selective and stealthy electrodes that provide reliable neural integration and maintain neuronal viability. This paper reports a novel Hollow Ring-like type electrode to sense and/or stimulate neural activity from three-dimensional neural networks. Due to its unique design, the ring electrode architecture enables easy and reliable access of the electrode to three-dimensional neural networks with reduced pressure on the biological tissue, while providing improved electrical interface with cells. The Hollow ring electrodes, particularly when coated with the conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS, show improved electrical properties with extremely low impedance and high charge injection capabilities, when compared to traditional planar disk-type electrodes. The ring design also serves as an optimal architecture for cell gowth to create an optimal subcellular electrical- neural interface. In addition, we demonstrated that the quality of recorded neural signals by the ring electrode was higher than recordings from a traditional disk-type electrode in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and burst detection from 3D neuronal networks in vitro. Overall, our results suggest the great potential of the hollow ring design for developing next-generation microelectrodes for applications in neural interfaces used in physiological studies and neuromodulation applications.",

It is based on in silico attachment of rotamer ensemble representations of spin labels to protein structures. chiLife enables the development of custom protein analysis and modeling pipelines using SDSL EPR experimental data. It allows the user to add custom spin labels, scoring functions and spin label modeling methods. chiLife is designed with integration into third-party software in mind, to take advantage of the diverse and rapidly expanding set of molecular modeling tools available with a Python interface. This article describes the main design principles of chiLife and presents a series of examples.\n\nAuthor summaryThanks to modern modeling methods like AlphaFold2, RosettaFold, and ESMFold, high-resolution structural models of proteins are widely available. While these models offer insight into the structure and function of biomedically and technologically significant proteins, most of them are not experimentally validated. Furthermore, many proteins exhibit functionally important conformational flexibility that is not captured by these models. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing protein structure and conformational heterogeneity, making it ideal for validating, refining, and expanding protein models. To extract quantitative protein backbone information from experimental SDSL EPR data, accurate modeling methods are needed. For this purpose, we introduce chiLife, an open-source Python package for SDSL modeling designed to be extensible and integrable with other Python-based protein modeling packages. With chiLife, appropriate SDSL EPR experiments for protein model validation can be designed, and protein models can be refined using experimental SDSL EPR data as constraints.",

    "abstract": "Cell state evolution underlies tumor development and response to therapy1, but mechanisms specifying cancer cell states and intratumor heterogeneity are incompletely understood. Schwannomas are the most common tumors of the peripheral nervous system and are treated with surgery and ionizing radiation2-5. Schwannomas can oscillate in size for many years after radiotherapy6,7, suggesting treatment may reprogram schwannoma cells or the tumor microenvironment. Here we show epigenetic reprogramming shapes the cellular landscape of schwannomas. We find schwannomas are comprised of 2 molecular groups distinguished by reactivation of neural crest development pathways or misactivation of nerve injury mechanisms that specify cancer cell states and the architecture of the tumor immune microenvironment. Schwannoma molecular groups can arise independently, but ionizing radiation is sufficient for epigenetic reprogramming of neural crest to immune-enriched schwannoma by remodeling chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and metabolism to drive schwannoma cell state evolution and immune cell infiltration. To define functional genomic mechanisms underlying epigenetic reprograming of schwannomas, we develop a technique for simultaneous interrogation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression coupled with genetic and therapeutic perturbations in single-nuclei. Our results elucidate a framework for understanding epigenetic drivers of cancer evolution and establish a paradigm of epigenetic reprograming of cancer in response to radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) leads to genomic instability that marks HRD tumor genome with a specific genomic scar. Present in many cancers, HRD is important to be detected as it is associated with a hyper-sensitivity to some classes of drugs, in particular the PARP inhibitors. Here, we investigate the use of structural variants detected by the Optical Genome Mapping (OGM) technology to identify HRD tumors. We first compared the performance of OGM and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in an HRD triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) carrying a germline BRCA2 deleterious mutation. We showed the excellent performance of OGM and its ability to recognize subclonal events not detected by WGS. We then analyzed by RVA OGM data from fifteen TNBC samples from the clinical trial RadioPARP. We defined two features characteristic of HRD. Tandem duplication (TD) and insertion events were found increased in HRD tumors. We showed that insertion calls were probably mostly TD too small to be called as TD by RVA. The insertion/TD feature fully discriminated HRD from all homologous recombination proficient (HRP) TNBC but one. This outlier carried a CCNE1 amplicon probably explaining the excess of insertion/TD. Total numbers of translocations were similar in HRP and HRD TNBC. We suggested a novel feature, translocations and intra-fusions isolated from another event by 3 megabases. Isolated translocations and intra-fusions perfectly discriminated HRD from HRP TNBC.\n\nOur results demonstrate that the OGM technology is an affordable way of getting an insight of the structural variants present in solid tumors, even with low tumoral cellularity. It represents an alternative technology for HRD diagnosis, which should now be evaluated in independent series of tumors of different tissue origins.",

    "abstract": "We examine the possibility that expanding trans-Mediterranean trade during the Iron Age (ca. 1,000-350 BCE) has resulted in increased morphological variability among sheep from maritime sites in the southern Levant. Using geometric morphometric tools, we compared the variability in sheep astragal morphology in a port settlement on the Carmel coast (Tel Dor), a coastal settlement in the Akko valley (Tell Keisan), and an inland urban settlement in the Hula Valley (Tel Abel Beit Maacah). Our results suggest that the sheep astragali from the port settlement at Tel Dor occupy a significantly different part of shape space than the specimens examined from the two other sites. In addition, a source-sink dynamic is implied by the appearance of coastal morphotypes in the inland site, whereas unique inland morphotypes do not occur at the coastal site. This findings do not contradict the possibility of maritime importation and consequent overland spread of non-local sheep variants in the southern Levant during the heyday of  Phoenician trade.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal dense-core vesicles (DCVs) contain neuropeptides and much larger proteins that affect synaptic growth and plasticity. Rather than using full collapse exocytosis that is common in endocrine cells, DCVs at a native intact synapse, the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, release their contents via fusion pores formed by kiss and run exocytosis. Here fluorogen activating protein (FAP) imaging reveals the permeability range of synaptic DCV fusion pores and then shows that this constraint is circumvented by cAMP-induced extra fusions with dilating pores that result in DCV emptying. These Ca2+-independent full fusions require PKA-R2, a PKA phosphorylation site on the fusion clamp protein complexin and the acute presynaptic function of Rugose/Neurobeachin, a PKA-R2 anchor implicated in learning and autism. Therefore, localized Ca2+-independent cAMP signaling opens dilating fusion pores to release large cargo proteins that cannot pass through the narrower fusion pores that normally dominate spontaneous and Ca2+-evoked synaptic protein release. Hence, two independent exocytosis triggers (Ca2+ and cAMP) vary the composition of released proteins at the synapse by differentially adjusting DCV fusion pores.",

Here, we apply cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to monitor Env-CD4 interactions at membrane-membrane interfaces formed between HIV-1 and CD4-presenting virus-like particles. Env-CD4 complexes organized into clusters and rings, bringing opposing membranes closer together. Additionally, Env-CD4 clustering was dependent on capsid maturation. Subtomogram averaging and classification revealed that Env bound one, two, and finally three CD4 molecules, upon which Env adopted a partially open state.

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton-bacteria interactions are stimulated by phytoplankton-released dissolved organic matter (DOMp). Two factors that shape the accompanying bacterial community are i) the \"donor\" phytoplankton species, defining the initial composition of released DOMp, and ii) the DOMp transformation over time. We added phytoplankton DOM from two globally abundant species - the diatom Skeletonema marinoi and the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MIT9312 - to natural bacterial communities in the Eastern Mediterranean and determined the bacterial responses over a time-course of 72 h in terms of cell numbers, bacterial production (BP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and changes in active bacterial community compositions based on rRNA amplicon sequencing. Both DOMp types were demonstrated to serve the bacterial community as carbon and potentially phosphorus source. Diatom-derived DOM induced higher BP and lower APA compared to cyanobacterium DOM after 24 h, but not after 48 and 72 h of incubation, and also maintained higher Shannon diversities over the course of the experiment, indicating a better bacterial accessibility and broader disposability of diatom derived DOM. Bacterial communities significantly differed between DOMp types as well as different incubation times, pointing to a certain bacterial specificity for the DOMp donor as well as a successive utilization of phytoplankton DOM by different bacterial taxa. The highest differences in bacterial community composition with DOMp types occurred shortly after additions, suggesting a high specificity towards highly bioavailable DOMp compounds. We conclude that phytoplankton associated bacterial communities are strongly shaped by an interplay between phytoplankton donor and the transformation of its released DOMp over time.\n\nIMPORTANCEPhytoplankton-bacteria interactions maintain biogeochemical cycles of global importance. Phytoplankton photosynthetically fix carbon dioxide and subsequently release the synthesized compounds as dissolved organic matter (DOMp), which becomes processed and recycled by heterotrophic bacteria. Yet, the combined effect of the phytoplankton donor species and time-dependent transformation of DOMp compounds on the accessibility to the bacterial community has not been explored until now. The diatom Skeletonema marinoi and the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MIT9312 are globally important phytoplankton species, and our study revealed that DOMp of both species was selectively incorporated by the bacterial community. The donor species had the highest impact shortly after DOMp appropriation, and its effect diminished over time. Our results improve the understanding of biogeochemical cycles between phytoplankton and bacteria, and solve yet unresolved questions of phytoplankton-bacteria interactions.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate, intracellular parasite capable of causing severe disease in warm-blooded animals. Infection of a cell produces a unique niche for the parasite named the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) initially composed of host plasma membrane invaginated during invasion. The PV and its membrane (PVM) are subsequently decorated with a variety of parasite proteins allowing the parasite to optimally grow in addition to manipulate host processes. Recently, we reported a proximity-labeling screen at the PVM-host interface and identified host ER-resident MOSPD2 as being enriched at this location. Here we extend these findings in several important respects. First, we show that the extent and pattern of host MOSPD2 association with the PVM differs dramatically in cells infected with different strains of Toxoplasma. Second, in cells infected with Type I RH strain, the MOSPD2 staining is mutually exclusive with regions of the PVM that associate with mitochondria. Third, immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS with epitope-tagged MOSPD2-expressing host cells reveals strong enrichment of several PVM-localized parasite proteins, although none appear to play an essential role in MOSPD2 association. Lastly, most MOSPD2 associating with the PVM is newly translated after infection of the cell and requires the major functional domains of MOSPD2, identified as the CRAL/TRIO domain and tail anchor, although these domains were not sufficient for PVM association. Collectively, these studies provide new insight into the molecular interactions involving MOSPD2 at the dynamic interface between the PVM and the host cytosol.\n\nImportanceToxoplasma gondii is an intracellular pathogen that lives within a membranous vacuole inside of its host cell. This vacuole is decorated by a variety of parasite proteins that allow it to defend against host attack, acquire nutrients, and interact with the host cell. Recent work identified and validated host proteins enriched at this host-pathogen interface. Here, we follow up on one candidate named MOSPD2 shown to be enriched at the vacuolar membrane and describe it as having a dynamic interaction at this location depending on a variety of factors. Some of these include the presence of host mitochondria, intrinsic domains of the host protein, and whether translation is active. Importantly, we show that MOSPD2 enrichment at the vacuole membrane differs between strains indicating active involvement of the parasite with this phenotype. Altogether, these results shed light on the mechanism and role of protein associations in the host-pathogen interaction.",

    "abstract": "The protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii relies on tight regulation of gene expression to invade and establish infection in its host. The divergent gene regulatory mechanisms of Toxoplasma and related apicomplexan pathogens rely heavily on regulators of chromatin structure and histone modifications. The important contribution of histone acetylation for Toxoplasma in both acute and chronic infection has been demonstrated, where histone acetylation increases at active gene loci. However, the direct consequences of specific histone acetylation marks and the chromatin pathway that influences transcriptional regulation in response to the modification is unclear. As a reader of lysine acetylation, the bromodomain serves as a mediator between the acetylated histone and transcriptional regulators. Here we show that the bromodomain protein TgBDP1 which is conserved amongst Apicomplexa and within the Alveolata superphylum, is essential for Toxoplasma asexual proliferation. Using CUT&TAG we demonstrate that TgBDP1 is recruited to transcriptional start sites of a large proportion of parasite genes. Transcriptional profiling during TgBDP1 knockdown revealed that loss of TgBDP1 leads to major dysregulation of gene expression, implying multiple roles for TgBDP1 in both gene activation and repression. This is supported by interactome analysis of TgBDP1 demonstrating that TgBDP1 forms a core complex with two other bromodomain proteins and an ApiAP2 factor. This core complex appears to interact with other epigenetic factors such as nucleosome remodelling complexes. We conclude that TgBDP1 interacts with diverse epigenetic regulators to exert opposing influences on gene expression in the Toxoplasma tachyzoite.\n\nSummaryHistone acetylation is critical for proper regulation of gene expression in the single celled eukaryotic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. Bromodomain proteins are \"readers\" of histone acetylation and may link the modified chromatin to transcription factors. Here, we show that the bromodomain protein TgBDP1 is essential for parasite survival and that loss of TgBDP1 results in global dysregulation of gene expression. TgBDP1 is recruited to the promoter region of a large proportion of parasite genes, forms a core complex with two other bromodomain proteins and interacts with different transcriptional regulatory complexes. We conclude that TgBDP1 is a key factor for sensing specific histone modifications to influence multiple facets of transcriptional regulation in Toxoplasma gondii.",

    "abstract": "Aridity, edaphic variables related to aridity, and livestock grazing are major drivers of plant community composition across dryland grasslands. With accounting these factors, little is known about differences in determinants and changing patterns along aridity gradients with different average of aridity. Thus, the comparative investigations of communities without and with grazing in semi-arid and arid regions are suitable to clarify the difference in compositional responses along aridity gradients between potential vegetations and degraded ones with grazing. We investigated compositional changes of communities without/with grazing in semi-arid (north) /arid (south) regions across Mongolia. The compositional changes based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity were investigated by generalized dissimilarity modeling, including geographic distance, aridity, soil pH, and sand and clay contents as independent variables. The determinants and changing patterns of community composition were compared among the four groups. Aridity had significant impacts on community composition regardless of the regions and the absence/presence of grazing. However, without the dependency on grazing, the difference in response patterns was observed between the regions. The compositional change was steeper especially at the upper edge of aridity rather than the lower edge in the arid region. This indicates the vulnerability of plant communities to aridity shifts due to future climate change in desert steppe of Mongolia. In addition, regardless of the regions, the effects of soil pH on community composition were eliminated by grazing. Because soil pH indirectly affected by aridity shifts can have impacts on community composition of potential vegetations without grazing, the long-term monitoring of vegetation dynamics needs observations of both of communities without and with grazing.",

    "abstract": "Allelic series are of candidate therapeutic interest due to the existence of a dose-response relationship between the functionality of a gene and the degree or severity of a phenotype. We define an allelic series as a gene in which increasingly deleterious mutations lead to increasingly large phenotypic effects, and develop a gene-based rare variant association test specifically targeted for the identification of allelic series. Building on the well-known burden and sequence kernel association (SKAT) tests, we specify a variety of association models, covering different genetic architectures, and integrate these into a COding-variant Allelic Series Test (COAST). Through extensive simulations, we confirm that COAST maintains the type I error and improves power when the pattern of coding-variant effect sizes increases monotonically with mutational severity. We applied COAST to identify allelic series for 4 circulating lipid traits and 5 cell count traits among 145,735 subjects with available whole exome sequencing data from the UK Biobank. Compared with optimal SKAT (SKAT-O), COAST identified 29% more Bonferroni significant associations with circulating lipid traits, on average, and 82% more with cell count traits. All of the gene-trait associations identified by COAST have corroborating evidence either from rare-variant associations in the full cohort (Genebass, N = 400K), or from common variant associations in the GWAS catalog. In addition to detecting many gene-trait associations present in Genebass using only a fraction (36.9%) of the sample, COAST detects associations, such as ANGPTL4 with triglycerides, that are absent from Genebass but which have clear common variant support.",

    "abstract": "The flight behaviour of predatory birds is well modelled by a guidance law called proportional navigation, which commands steering in proportion to the angular rate of the line-of-sight from predator to prey. The line-of-sight rate is defined with respect to an inertial frame of reference, so proportional navigation is necessarily implemented using visual-inertial sensor fusion. In Harris hawks, pursuit of terrestrial targets may be even better modelled by assuming that visual-inertial information on the line-of-sight rate is combined with visual information on the deviation angle between the attackers velocity and the line-of-sight. Here we ask whether a new variant of this mixed guidance law can model Harris hawk pursuit behaviour successfully using visual information alone. We use high-speed motion capture to record n=228 attack fights from N=4 Harris hawks, and confirm that proportional navigation and mixed guidance using visual-inertial information both model the trajectory data well. Moreover, the mixed guidance law still models the data closely if visual-inertial information on the line-of-sight rate is replaced with purely visual information on the apparent motion of the target relative to the background. Although the original form of the mixed guidance law provides the closest fit, all three models provide an adequate phenomenological model of the behavioural data, whilst each making different predictions on the physiological pathways involved.",

    "abstract": "The combination of neuroimaging and targeted neuromodulation is a crucial tool to gain a deeper understanding of neural networks at a circuit level. Infrared neurostimulation (INS) is a promising optical modality that allows to evoke neuronal activity with high spatial resolution without need for the introduction of exogenous substances in the brain. Here, we report the use of whole-brain functional [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging during INS in the dorsal striatum, performed using a multifunctional soft neural probe. We demonstrate the possibility to identify multi-circuit connection patterns in both cortical and subcortical brain regions within a single scan. By using a bolus plus infusion FDG-PET scanning protocol, we were able to observe the metabolic rate evolution in these regions during the experiments and correlate its variation with the onset of the INS stimulus. Due to the focality of INS and the large amount of viable molecular targets for PET, this novel approach to simultaneous imaging and stimulation is highly versatile. This pilot study can pave the way to further understand the brain connectivity on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Visually guided reaching is a common motor behavior that engages subcortical circuits to mediate rapid corrections. These circuits help us successfully grasp objects we see, even if those objects move during the reach. Although these neural mechanisms have evolved for interaction with the physical world, they are almost always studied in the context of reaching toward virtual targets displayed on a computer or projection screen. Virtual targets are unrealistic both because they cannot be physically grasped and because they generally move by \"jumping\" from one place to another instantaneously. Recent work has indicated that various aspects of \"real\" visual stimuli, including proximity and graspability, elicit distinct neural activity. In this study, we instructed participants to perform rapid reaches to physical objects. On some trials, these objects either moved realistically (continuously from one position to another) or unrealistically (jumping instantaneously to an equivalent position). Participants were consistently faster in correcting their reach trajectories when the object moved continuously.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine release in the forebrain by midbrain ventral tegmental nucleus (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) neurons is implicated in reward processing, goal-directed learning, and decision-making. Rhythmic oscillations of neural excitability underlie coordination of network processing, and have been reported in these dopaminergic nuclei at several frequency bands. This paper provides a comparative characterization of several frequencies of oscillations of local field potential and single unit activity, highlighting some behavioral correlates. We recorded from optogenetically identified dopaminergic sites in mice training in operant olfactory and visual discrimination tasks. Rayleigh and Pairwise Phase Consistency (PPC) analyses revealed some VTA/SNc neurons phase-locked to each frequency range, with fast spiking interneurons (FSIs) prevalent at 1-2.5 Hz (slow) and 4 Hz bands, and dopaminergic neurons predominant in the theta band. More FSIs than dopaminergic neurons were phase-locked in the slow and 4 Hz bands during many task events. The highest incidence of phase-locking in neurons was in the slow and 4 Hz bands, and occurred during the delay between the operant choice and trial outcome (reward or punishment) signals. These data provide a basis for further examination of rhythmic coordination of activity of dopaminergic nuclei with other brain structures, and its impact for adaptive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Opioids produce profound and diverse effects on a range of behaviors, many driven by brainstem activity; however, the presence of opioid and opioid-like receptors at this level has been poorly studied outside of nociceptive structures and components of respiratory circuitry. While previous studies identified expression of {micro}, {delta}, {kappa}, and nociceptin opioid and opioid-like receptors in the brainstem, patterns have not been fully delineated, and neither has receptor coexpression nor the behavioral implications of their expression in most structures. We aimed to elucidate expression patterns for all four receptors across somatosensory-motor, auditory, and respiratory brainstem circuits; identify recurring themes to provide insight into the mechanisms by which exogenous opioids affect broader brainstem circuits; and characterize the function of endogenous opioids in subcortical processing and behavior modulation. Using a fluorescent reporter mouse line for each receptor, we created a comprehensive atlas of brainstem receptor distribution and identified novel expression patterns in modality-specific circuits. Each receptor showed unique expression patterns across the brainstem with minimal correlation between receptors. Orofacial somatosensory-motor circuits expressed all four receptors, though generally in distinct regions, suggesting differential opiate modulation of afferent and efferent trigeminal signaling. Within the auditory circuits, receptors segregated along the vertical and horizontal processing pathways with minimal colocalization. Finally, the respiratory circuit strongly expressed the {micro} opioid receptor in multiple crucial structures with minimal presence of the other three receptors. We further assessed the functional significance of these expression patterns, using the respiratory circuitry as an example, by characterizing respiratory responses to selective opioid agonists, finding that each agonist caused unique alterations in breathing pattern and/or breath shape. Together, these results establish a comprehensive atlas of opioid and opioid-like receptor expression throughout the brainstem, laying the essential groundwork for further evaluation of opioid neuromodulation across the broad spectrum of behaviors.",
