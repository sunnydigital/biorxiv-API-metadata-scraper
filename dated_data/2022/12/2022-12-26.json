    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been thought to be the biophysical principle governing the assembly of the multiphase structures of nucleoli, the site of ribosomal biogenesis. Condensates assembled through LLPS increase their sizes to minimize the surface energy as far as their components are available. However, multiple microphases, fibrillar centers (FCs), dispersed in a nucleolus are stable and their sizes do not grow unless the transcription of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is inhibited. To understand the mechanism of the suppression of the FC growth, we here construct a minimal theoretical model by taking into account the nascent pre-rRNAs tethered to the FC surfaces by RNA polymerase I. Our theory predicts that nascent pre-rRNAs generate the lateral osmotic pressure that counteracts the surface tension of the FCs and this suppresses the growth of the FCs over the stable size. The stable FC size decreases with increasing the transcription rate and decreasing the RNA processing rate. This prediction is supported by our experiments showing that RNA polymerase inhibitors increase the FC size in a dose-dependent manner. This theory may provide insight into the general mechanism of the size control of nuclear bodies.\n\nSignificance statementThe nucleolus, a site of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) production, has a characteristic multiphase structure, which has been thought to be assembled through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Although condensates assembled through LLPS grow by coarsening or coalescence as far as the components are available, the multiple inner phases, fibrillar centers (FCs), are dispersed in a nucleolus. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we constructed a minimal theoretical model by considering nascent pre-rRNAs tethered to RNA polymerase I at the FC surface. This model is supported by our experiments and explains previous experimental observations. This work shed light on the role of nascent RNAs to control the size of nuclear bodies.",

    "abstract": "Diseases change over time, both phenotypically and in underlying driving molecular processes. Though understanding disease progression dynamics is critical for diagnostics and treatment, capturing these dynamics is difficult, due to their complexity and the high heterogeneity between individuals. We developed TimeAx, an algorithm which builds a comparative framework for capturing disease dynamics using high-dimensional short time-series data. We demonstrate TimeAx utility by studying disease progression dynamics for multiple diseases and data types. Notably, for urothelial bladder cancer tumorigenesis, we identified a stromal pro-invasion point on the disease progression axis, characterized by massive immune cell infiltration to the tumor microenvironment and increased mortality. Moreover, the continuous TimeAx model differentiated between early and late tumors within the same tumor subtype, uncovering novel molecular transitions and potential targetable pathways. Overall, we present a powerful approach for studying disease progression dynamics, providing improved molecular interpretability and clinical benefits for patient stratification and outcome prediction.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Ra strain has been reported to rapidly enter the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state following treatment with an NADH oxidase inhibitor (diphenyleneiodonium [DPI]) and to be reactivated by fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, the mechanism underlying FBS-induced reactivation is unclear. We tried to reveal the mechanism of FBS-induced reactivation using M. tuberculosis H37Rv.\n\nMethodsFirst, we evaluated the effect of DPI on culturability, viability and changes of acid-fastness toward H37Rv. Secondly, we measured the reactivation-promoting effects of human serum albumin, egg-white albumin and antioxidative agents in DPI-induced VBNC cells. We also inhibited adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase which is the downstream of adenylyl cyclase to evaluate the influence to reactivation capacity of bovine serum albumin (BSA).\n\nResultsDPI treatment induced VBNC state in H37Rv, resulting in a high proportion of viable cells but a low proportion of culturable cells, loss of acid-fastness and lipid-accumulation. Not only FBS but also BSA alone could reactivate H37Rv. Contrary to our expectation, only human serum albumin had a similar restorative effect to BSA. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by SQ22536 did not have a significant effect on reactivation; however, the inhibition of mycobacterial protein kinase by H89 and staurosporine strongly suppressed the BSA-induced reactivation.\n\nConclusionDPI-induced VBNC Mtb cells may be reactivated via the activation of protein kinase-dependent cell division processes through interaction with BSA.",

    "abstract": "Essential oils (EOs) are increasingly used as biopesticides due to their insecticidal potential. This study addresses their non-target effects on a biological control agent: the egg parasitoid Trichogramma evanescens. In particular, we tested whether EOs affected parasitoid fitness either directly, by decreasing pre-imaginal survival, or indirectly, by disrupting parasitoids orientation abilities. The effect of Anise, Fennel, Sweet orange, Basil, Coriander, Oregano, Peppermint, Mugwort, Rosemary and Thyme EOs were studied on five strains of T. evanescens. Specific experimental setups were developed, and data obtained from image analysis were interpreted with phenomenological models fitted with Bayesian inference. Results highlight the fumigant toxicity of EOs on parasitoid development. Anise, Fennel, Basil, Coriander, Oregano, Peppermint and Thyme EOs are particularly toxic and drastically reduce the emergence rate of T. evanescens. Most EOs also affect parasitoid behavior: (i) Basil, Coriander, Oregano, Peppermint, Mugwort and Thyme EOs are highly repellent for naive female parasitoids; (ii) Anise and Fennel EOs can have repellent or attractive effects depending on strains; and (iii) Sweet orange, Oregano and Rosemary EOs have no detectable impact on orientation behavior. This study shows that EOs fumigation have non-target effects on egg parasitoids. This highlights the need to cautiously precise the deployment framework of biopesticides in an agroecological perspective.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often described as promising models of human vision, yet they show many differences from human abilities. We focus on a superhuman capacity of top-performing CNNs, namely, their ability to learn very large datasets of random patterns. We verify that human learning on such tasks is extremely limited, even with few stimuli. We argue that the performance difference is due to CNNs overcapacity and introduce biologically inspired mechanisms to constrain it, while retaining the good test set generalisation to structured images as characteristic of CNNs. We investigate the efficacy of adding noise to hidden units activations, restricting early convolutional layers with a bottleneck, and using a bounded activation function. Internal noise was the most potent intervention and the only one which, by itself, could reduce random data performance in the tested models to chance levels. We also investigated whether networks with biologically inspired capacity constraints show improved generalisation to out-of-distribution stimuli, however little benefit was observed. Our results suggest that constraining networks with biologically motivated mechanisms paves the way for closer correspondence between network and human performance, but the few manipulations we have tested are only a small step towards that goal.",

    "abstract": "A prominent trend in single-cell transcriptomics is providing spatial context alongside a characterization of each cells molecular state. This typically requires targeting an a priori selection of genes, often covering less than 1% of the genome, and a key question is how to optimally determine the small gene panel. Reference data from these methods covering the whole genome is unavailable, and using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets as a surrogate can result in suboptimal gene panels due to the fundamentally different data distributions across technologies. We address these challenges by introducing a flexible deep learning framework, PERSIST, to identify informative gene targets for spatial transcriptomics studies by leveraging existing scRNA-seq data. Using datasets spanning different brain regions, species, and scRNA-seq technologies, we show that PERSIST reliably identifies gene panels that provide more accurate prediction of the genome-wide expression profile, thereby capturing more information with fewer genes. Furthermore, PERSIST can be adapted to meet specific biological goals, such as classifying cell types or discerning neuronal electrical properties. Finally, via a simulation study based on a recent in situ hybridization-based dataset, we demonstrate that PERSISTs binarization of gene expression levels enables models trained on scRNA-seq data to generalize with input data obtained using spatial transcriptomics, despite the complex domain shift between these technologies.",

Here, we bridge microscale molecular chemoarchitecture and pharmacologically-induced macroscale functional reorganisation, by relating the regional distribution of 19 neurotransmitter receptors and transporters obtained from Positron Emission Tomography, and the regional changes in functional MRI connectivity induced by 10 different mind-altering drugs: propofol, sevoflurane, ketamine, LSD, psilocybin, DMT, ayahuasca, MDMA, modafinil, and methylphenidate. Our results reveal that psychoactive drugs exert their effects on brain function by engaging multiple neurotransmitter systems. The effects of both anaesthetics and psychedelics on brain function are organised along hierarchical gradients of brain structure and function. Finally, we show that regional co-susceptibility to pharmacological interventions recapitulates co-susceptibility to disorder-induced structural alterations.

However, ongoing virus transmission, continuous evolution, and increasing selective pressures have the potential to yield viral variants capable of resisting these interventions. Here, we investigate the susceptibility of natural variants of the main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 to protease inhibitors. Multiple single amino acid changes in Mpro confer resistance to nirmatrelvir (the active component of Paxlovid). An additional clinical-stage inhibitor, ensitrelvir (Xocova), shows a different resistance mutation profile. Importantly, phylogenetic analyses indicate that several of these resistant variants have pre-existed the introduction of these drugs into the human population and are capable of spreading. These results encourage the monitoring of resistance variants and the development of additional protease inhibitors and other antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action and resistance profiles for combinatorial therapy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryResistance to protease inhibitor drugs, nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and ensitrelvir (Xocova), exists in SARS-CoV-2 variants in the human population.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent cocaine abuse increases the risk for developing addiction in later life, which remains a big public health concern, but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Here, adolescent cocaine-exposed (ACE) male mice models were established by administrating cocaine during adolescent period. When growing to adult age, mice were subjected to conditioned place preference (CPP) to evaluate the sensitivity to cocaine, then potential molecule of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) were screened out by transcriptomic sequencing. Subthreshold dose of cocaine (sdC), that is insufficient to produce CPP, was used to induce CPP in adulthood. The sdC treatment effectively induced CPP in ACE mice during adulthood, accompanied with the more triggered CaMKII-positive neurons, and induced higher Dusp1 gene, lower DUSP1 protein, lower DUSP1 activity and lower DUSP1 expression on CaMKII-positive neurons (DUSP1CaMKII) in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Overexpressing DUSP1CaMKII suppressed CaMKII-positive neuronal activation, and ultimately blocked sdC-induced CPP in ACE mice during adulthood. While, knocking-down DUSP1CaMKII activated more CaMKII-positive neurons, and aggravated sdC-preferred behavior in ACE mice during adulthood. ERK1/2 might be potential subsequent signal for DUSP1 in the process. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying adolescent drug abuse-induced susceptibility to addiction during adulthood, and mPFC DUSP1CaMKII is a promising pharmacological target to predict or treat addiction, especially caused by adolescent substance use.\n\nSummaryAdolescent cocaine exposure causes higher cocaine-preferred behaviors during adulthood, along with evoked mPFC activity in response to cocaine challenge. Locally overexpressing but not knocking-down the dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) on CaMKII-positive neurons (DUSP1CaMKII) suppresses mPFC activation, and ultimately rescues the higher sensitivity to cocaine during adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered as one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies. Development of chemoresistance in PDAC is one of the key contributors for the poor survival outcomes of PDAC patients and the major reason for urgent development of novel pharmacological approaches for effective treatment of PDAC. Systematically tailored combination therapy holds the promise for advancing the treatment of PDAC, but number of possible combinations considering all approved drugs and drug candidates is too large to be explored empirically. In respect to the many epigenetic alterations in PDAC, epigenetic drugs including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) could be seen as a game changer but available data indicates their efficacy only in combined therapy settings. In this work, we explored possibility of using drug-sensitivity data together with basal gene expression data on pancreatic cell lines to predict the combinatorial options available for HDACi and developed bioinformatics screening protocol for predictions of synergistic drug combinations in PDAC. Our results identified sphingolipid signaling pathway with associated downstream effectors as a promising novel target for future development of multi-target therapeutics or combined therapy with HDACi. Through the experimental validation, we have characterized novel synergism between HDACi and a Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor RKI-1447, and HDACi and a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist fingolimod.",

    "abstract": "Our actions and choices sometimes seem driven by our \"needs\", sometimes by our \"wants\", and sometimes by both. Needing is related to deprivation of something biologically significant, and wanting is linked to reward prediction and dopamine and usually has more power on behavioral activation than need states alone. Why sometimes there is an association and sometimes a dissociation between needing and wanting remains largely unknown. This paper aims to clarify the relations between needing and wanting, from the perspective of a normative framework to understand brain and cognition; namely, active inference. In this approach, needing is related to a deviation from preferred states that living things tend to occupy in order to reduce their surprise, while wanting is related to the precision over policies that lead to preferred (e.g., rewarding) states. Also, we hypothesized that needing exerts a pervasive effect that is embodied on the organism. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate the interplay between needing and wanting systems. Specifically, our simulations show that when need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states is enhanced, independently of wanting (or reward prediction), therefore showing a dissociation between needing and wanting. Furthermore, the simulations show that when need states increase, the value of cues that signal reward achievement and the precision of the policies that lead to preferred states increase, suggesting that needs can amplify the value of a reward and its wanting. Taken together, our model and simulations help clarify the directional and underlying influence of need states separately from wanting and reward prediction; and how the same underlying influence of need amplifies wanting, i.e. increases the precision of available reward cues that lead to the preferred state.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the mammalian inferior colliculus (IC) are sensitive to the velocity (speed and direction) of fast frequency chirps contained in Schroeder-phase harmonic complexes (SCHR). However, IC neurons are also sensitive to stimulus periodicity, a prominent feature of SCHR stimuli. Here, to disentangle velocity sensitivity from periodicity tuning, we introduced a novel stimulus consisting of aperiodic random chirps. Extracellular, single-unit recordings were made in the IC of Dutch-belted rabbits. Periodicity tuning was characterized using modulation transfer functions (MTFs). The prevalence of direction selectivity to SCHR and aperiodic chirps was quantified, demonstrating that the majority of IC neurons (90.5%) were selective for SCHR-chirp direction and that nearly all neurons were selective for aperiodic-chirp direction (99.6%). Rate-velocity functions were constructed from aperiodic chirp responses, revealing that neurons were commonly sensitive to the direction of lower-velocity (0.40 - 1.59 kHz/ms) chirps and were often insensitive to the direction of higher-velocity chirps (3.16 - 9.24 kHz/ms). Rate-velocity functions and MTFs were combined using a generalized linear model to predict SCHR response rates--this analysis revealed that both velocity and periodicity cues were required to explain SCHR responses. In general, velocity cues had a stronger effect on responses for harmonic stimuli with lower fundamental frequencies. This result has implications for neural encoding of complex sounds that combine envelope periodicities and frequency-sweeps, such as speech.",

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) protein 1 (TAL1) is a central transcription factor in hematopoiesis. The timing and level of TAL1 expression orchestrate the differentiation to specialized blood cells and its overexpression is a common cause of T-ALL. Here we studied the two protein isoforms of TAL1, short and long, that are generated by the use of alternative promoters as well as by alternative splicing. We analyzed the expression of each isoform by deleting an enhancer or insulator, or by opening chromatin at the enhancer location. Our results show that each enhancer promotes expression from a specific TAL1 promoter. Expression from a specific promoter gives rise to a unique 5 UTR with differential regulation of translation. Moreover, our study suggests that the enhancers regulate TAL1 exon 3 alternative splicing by inducing changes in the chromatin at the splice site, which we demonstrate is mediated by KMT2B. Furthermore, our results indicate that TAL1-short binds more strongly to TAL1 E-protein partners and functions as a stronger transcription factor than TAL1-long. Specifically TAL1-short has a unique transcription signature promoting apoptosis. Finally, when we expressed both isoforms in mice bone-marrow, we found that while overexpression of both isoforms prevents lymphoid differentiation, expression of TAL-short alone leads to hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion. Furthermore, we found that TAL1-short promoted erythropoiesis and reduced cell survival in the CML cell line K562. While TAL1 and its partners are considered promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of T-ALL, our results show that TAL1-short could act as a tumor suppressor and suggest that altering TAL1 isoforms ratio could be a preferred therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "SummaryInitiation of mRNA translation is a key regulatory step in gene expression in all eukaryotes. Canonical initiation of translation in eukaryotes involves recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex to the 5' end of mRNA by the cap-binding complex eIF4F to form the 48S initiation complex (48S), followed by scanning along the mRNA until the start codon is selected.1-8 We have previously shown that eIF4F binds near the mRNA channel exit site of the 43S, leaving an open question about how mRNA secondary structure is removed as it enters the mRNA binding channel on the other side of the 40S subunit.4 Here we describe a human 48S positioned at the start codon that shows that in addition to the eIF4A that is part of eIF4F, there is a second eIF4A helicase bound to the mRNA entry site. The entry channel bound eIF4A is positioned through interactions with eIF3 and the 40S subunit to enable its ATP-dependent helicase activity to directly unwind secondary structure located downstream of the scanning 48S complex. The structure also reveals universally conserved interactions between eIF4F and the 48S, likely explaining how this complex can promote mRNA recruitment in all eukaryotes. mRNA translation has emerged as an important tool for developing innovative therapies, yet several fundamental aspects of its regulation remain unknown. This work sheds light on the critical regulatory roles of eIF4A and eIF4F during the recruitment and scanning of the 5' UTR of mRNA.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) form a relatively poorly recognized layer of the epigenome. The caRNAs reported to date are transcribed from the nuclear genome. Here, leveraging a recently developed assay for detection of caRNAs and their genomic association, we report that mitochondrial RNAs (mtRNAs) are attached to the nuclear genome and constitute a subset of caRNA, which we termed mt-caRNA. In four human cell types analyzed, mt-caRNAs preferentially attach to promoter regions. In human endothelial cells (ECs), the level of mt-caRNA-promoter attachment changes in response to environmental stress that mimics diabetes. Suppression of a non-coding mt-caRNA in ECs attenuates stress-induced nascent RNA transcription from the nuclear genome, including that of critical genes regulating cell adhesion, and abolishes stress-induced monocyte adhesion, a hallmark of dysfunctional ECs. Finally, we report increased nuclear localization of multiple mtRNAs in the ECs of human diabetic donors, suggesting many mtRNA translocate to the nucleus in a cell stress and disease-dependent manner. These data nominate mt-caRNAs as messenger molecules responsible for mitochondrial-nuclear communication and connect the immediate product of mitochondrial transcription with the transcriptional regulation of the nuclear genome.",

    "abstract": "In plants, age-related resistance (ARR) refers to a gain of disease resistance during shoot or organ maturation. ARR associated with vegetative phase change, a transition from juvenile to adult stage, is a widespread agronomic trait affecting resistance against multiple pathogens. How innate immunity in a plant is differentially regulated during successive stages of shoot maturation is unclear. In this work, we found that Arabidopsis thaliana showed ARR against its bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 during vegetative phase change. The timing of the ARR activation was associated with a temporal drop of miR156 level. A systematic inspection of the loss- and gain-of-function mutants of 11 SPL genes revealed that a subset of SPL genes, notably SPL2, SPL10, and SPL11, activated ARR in adult stage. The immune function of SPL10 was independent of its role in morphogenesis. Furthermore, the SPL10 mediated an age-dependent augmentation of the salicylic acid (SA) pathway partially by direct activation of PAD4. Disrupting SA biosynthesis or signaling abolished the ARR against Pto DC3000. Our work demonstrated that the miR156-SPL10 module in Arabidopsis is deployed to operate immune outputs over developmental timing.\n\nSignificanceAge-associated change of immunity is a widespread phenomenon in animals and plants. How organisms integrate immune maturation into a developmental clock is a fundamental question. Heterochronic microRNAs are key regulators of developmental timing. We found that a conserved heterochronic microRNA (miRNA) in Arabidopsis, microRNA156, regulates the timing of age-related resistance associated with a transition from the juvenile to the adult vegetative phase. The coordination between developmental maturation and gain of disease resistance is achieved through miR156-controlled SPL transcription factors with distinct functions. A subset of SPL transcription factors promoted resistance by directly activating key genes in defense signaling. This work bridges the knowledge gap between vegetative development and age-related resistance. Pinpointing mechanisms of the developmental regulation on immunity may pave a way for unlocking the age limit on plant immunity and lay a foundation to applications in the precision agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton-bacteria interactions are stimulated by phytoplankton-released dissolved organic matter (DOMp). Two factors that shape the accompanying bacterial community are i) the \"donor\" phytoplankton species, defining the initial composition of released DOMp, and ii) the DOMp transformation over time. We added phytoplankton DOM from two globally abundant species - the diatom Skeletonema marinoi and the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MIT9312 - to natural bacterial communities in the Eastern Mediterranean and determined the bacterial responses over a time-course of 72 h in terms of cell numbers, bacterial production (BP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and changes in active bacterial community compositions based on rRNA amplicon sequencing. Both DOMp types were demonstrated to serve the bacterial community as carbon and potentially phosphorus source. Diatom-derived DOM induced higher BP and lower APA compared to cyanobacterium DOM after 24 h, but not after 48 and 72 h of incubation, and also maintained higher Shannon diversities over the course of the experiment, indicating a better bacterial accessibility and broader disposability of diatom derived DOM. Bacterial communities significantly differed between DOMp types as well as different incubation times, pointing to a certain bacterial specificity for the DOMp donor as well as a successive utilization of phytoplankton DOM by different bacterial taxa. The highest differences in bacterial community composition with DOMp types occurred shortly after additions, suggesting a high specificity towards highly bioavailable DOMp compounds. We conclude that phytoplankton associated bacterial communities are strongly shaped by an interplay between phytoplankton donor and the transformation of its released DOMp over time.\n\nIMPORTANCEPhytoplankton-bacteria interactions maintain biogeochemical cycles of global importance. Phytoplankton photosynthetically fix carbon dioxide and subsequently release the synthesized compounds as dissolved organic matter (DOMp), which becomes processed and recycled by heterotrophic bacteria. Yet, the combined effect of the phytoplankton donor species and time-dependent transformation of DOMp compounds on the accessibility to the bacterial community has not been explored until now. The diatom Skeletonema marinoi and the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MIT9312 are globally important phytoplankton species, and our study revealed that DOMp of both species was selectively incorporated by the bacterial community. The donor species had the highest impact shortly after DOMp appropriation, and its effect diminished over time. Our results improve the understanding of biogeochemical cycles between phytoplankton and bacteria, and solve yet unresolved questions of phytoplankton-bacteria interactions.",

MNs are essential to movement and differentially susceptible in disease, but little is known about how MNs acquire functional subtype-specific features during development. Using single-cell RNA profiling in embryonic and larval zebrafish, we identify novel and conserved molecular signatures for MN functional subtypes, and identify genes expressed in both early post-mitotic and mature MNs. Assessing MN development in genetic mutants, we define a molecular program essential for MN functional subtype specification. Two evolutionarily-conserved transcription factors, Prdm16 and Mecom, are both functional subtype-specific determinants integral for fast MN development. Loss of prdm16 or mecom causes fast MNs to develop transcriptional profiles and innervation similar to slow MNs. These results reveal the molecular diversity of vertebrate axial MNs and demonstrate that functional subtypes are specified through intrinsic transcriptional codes.",

    "abstract": "Standard neuroeconomics theories state that the value of different classes of stimuli, for instance the hedonic value of food versus music, is transformed to a common reference scale that is independent of their sensory properties. However, adaptive behaviour in a multimodal and dynamic environment requires that our brain also encodes information about the sensory features of reward predicting stimuli. Whether and how a common code for value could integrate information about the sensory features of rewarding stimuli remains inadequately understood. By employing stimuli from auditory and visual modalities as reward predicting cues in a value-based decision-making task, we were able to vary the reward value and sensory modality independently and dissociate neural codes of auditory and visual rewards in frontal areas using fMRI. Univariate fMRI analysis revealed modality-specific and modality-general value representations in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), respectively. Crucially, modality-specific representations were highly selective as they were only activated when participants believed that the corresponding sensory modality was associated with reward and were absent when the task involved instruction-based rather than value-based choices. Moreover, we show that modality-specific value representations are supported by the presence of the effective connectivity between each primary sensory area and the corresponding OFC activation and further between modality-specific value representations in OFC and vmPFC, only when the sensory modality to be chosen is associated with reward and absent otherwise. Our results indicate the presence of both modality-specific and modality-general representations of reward value and reveal mechanisms through which the interaction between the sensory cortices and the two types of representation guides value-based decisions.",

Analysis of peptides isolated from a screen against the C-terminal bromodomain of family member BRD2, together with new peptides discovered in previous screens against the corresponding domain from BRD3 and BRD4, reveals peptides with nanomolar and subnanomolar affinities. X-ray crystal structures of several of these bromodomain-peptide complexes reveal diverse structures and binding modes, which nevertheless display several conserved binding features. A subset of the peptides demonstrates significant paralogue-level specificity, though structural analysis does not reveal clear physicochemical explanations for this specificity. Our data demonstrate the power of cyclic peptides to discriminate between highly similar proteins with high potency and hint that differences in conformational dynamics between BET-family bromodomains might modulate binding affinities amongst family members for particular ligands.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDecreased peak sodium current (INa) and increased late sodium current (INa,L), through the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 encoded by SCN5A, cause arrhythmias. Many NaV1.5 post-translational modifications have been reported by us and others. A recent report concluded that acute hypoxia increases INa,L by increasing a Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMOylation) at K442-NaV1.5.\n\nObjectiveTo determine whether and by what mechanisms SUMOylation alters INa, INa,L and cardiac electrophysiology.\n\nMethodsSUMOylation of NaV1.5 was detected by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. INa was measured by patch clamp with/without SUMO1 overexpression in HEK293 cells expressing wild type (WT) or K442R-NaV1.5 and in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCMs). SUMOylation effects were studied in vivo by electrocardiograms and ambulatory telemetry using Scn5a heterozygous knockout (SCN5A+/-) mice and the de-SUMOylating protein SENP2 (AAV9-SENP2) or the SUMOylation inhibitor anacardic acid. NaV1.5 trafficking was detected by immunofluorescence.\n\nResultsNaV1.5 was SUMOylated in HEK293 cells, NRCMs and human heart tissue. HyperSUMOylation at NaV1.5-K442 increased INa in NRCMs and in HEK cells overexpressing WT but not K442R-Nav1.5. SUMOylation did not alter other channel properties including INa,L. AAV9-SENP2 or anacardic acid treatment of SCN5A+/- mice decreased INa, prolonged QRS duration, and produced heart block and ventricular arrhythmias. SUMO1 overexpression enhanced membrane localization of NaV1.5.\n\nConclusionSUMOylation of K442-Nav1.5 increases peak INa without changing INa,L, at least in part by altering membrane abundance. Our findings do not support SUMOylation as a mechanism for changes in INa,L. Nav1.5 SUMOylation may modify arrhythmic risk in disease states and represents a potential target for pharmacological manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect many animals, including pets such as dogs and cats. Many studies have documented infection in companion animals by bio-molecular and serological methods. However, only a few have compared seroprevalence in cats and dogs from the general population, and these studies were limited by small sample sizes and collections over short periods. Our goal was to obtain a more accurate evaluation of seroprevalence in companion animals in France and to determine whether cats and dogs differ in their exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we conducted an extensive SARS-CoV-2 serological survey of 2036 cats and 3577 dogs sampled by veterinarians during medical examinations in clinics throughout France. Sampling was carried out from October 2020 through June 2021, a period encompassing the second and third waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans in the country. Using a microsphere immunoassay targeting the receptor binding domain and trimeric spike protein, we found 7.1% seroprevalence in pets. In a subset of 308 seropositive samples, 26.3% had neutralizing antibodies. We found that cats were significantly more likely to test positive than dogs, with seropositivity rates of 9.3% and 5.9% in cats and dogs, respectively. Finally, data for both species showed that seroprevalence was lower in older animals and was not associated with the date of sampling or the sex of the animal. Our results show that cats are significantly more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 than dogs, in line with experimental studies. Our large sample size provides for a reliable, statistically robust estimate of the frequency of infection of pets from their owners and offers strong support for the notion that cats are more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 than dogs. Our findings emphasise the importance of a One-Health approach to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and raise the question of whether companion animals in close contact with humans should be vaccinated.",

    "abstract": "The monkeypox virus (mpox virus, MPXV) epidemic in 2022 poses a significant public health risk. However, the evolutionary principles of MPXV are largely unknown. Here, we examined the evolutionary patterns of protein sequences and codon usage in MPXV. We first showed the signal of positive selection in OPG027 specifically in Clade I. We then discovered accelerated protein sequence evolution over time in 2022 outbreak-causing variants. We also found strong epistasis between amino acid substitutions located in different genes. Codon adaptation index (CAI) analysis revealed that MPXV tended to use more unpreferred codons than human genes and that the CAI decreased with time and diverged between clades, with Clade I > IIa and IIb-A > IIb-B. Although the decrease in fatality rate in the three groups matched the CAI pattern, it is unclear whether this is a coincidence or if the deoptimization of codon usage in MPXV induced a decrease in fatality. This study sheds new light on the processes influencing the evolution of MPXV in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Both pre-mRNA splicing and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification occur during transcription, enabling the potential crosstalk regulation between these two fundamental processes. The regional m6A location bias of avoiding splice site region, calls for an open hypothesis whether pre-mRNA splicing could affect m6A deposition. By deep learning modeling, we find that pre-mRNA splicing represses a proportion (4% to 32%) of m6A deposition at nearby exons. Experimental validation confirms such an inhibition as the m6A signal increases in mRNA once the host gene does not undergo pre-mRNA splicing to produce the same mRNA. Pre-mRNA splicing inhibited m6A sites tend to have higher m6A enhancers and lower m6A silencers locally than the m6A sites that are not inhibited. Moreover, this m6A deposition inhibition by pre-mRNA splicing shows high heterogeneity at different exons of mRNAs at genome-widely, with only a small proportion (12% to 15%) of exons showing strong inhibition, enabling stable mRNAs and flexible protein coding for important biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Fasciclins (FAS1) are ancient adhesion protein domains found across different phyla from bacteria to humans, with no common small ligand binding function reported. A unique FAS1-containing astaxanthin-binding protein (AstaP) from green algae can efficiently bind an unusually broad repertoire of carotenoids (astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, {beta}-carotene), but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here we dissect the structural basis for the ligand binding promiscuity of AstaP-orange1 (AstaPo1) by determining its solution NMR structure in complex with its natural ligand, astaxanthin (AXT), and validate this structure by SAXS, calorimetry, optical spectroscopy and mutagenesis data. While the unstructured tails of AstaPo1 are not essential for carotenoid binding, they enhance protein solubility. The a1-a2 helices of the AstaPo1 FAS1 domain embrace the carotenoid polyene like a jaw, organizing a conserved hydrophobic tunnel, too short to prevent the AXT {beta}-ionone rings from protruding on both sides of the tunnel, thereby not imposing specificity restrictions. The only specific protein-AXT interactions involve H-bonds between the oxygenated groups on AXT and a peripheral Gln56 residue. Remarkably, mapping of this and other AXT-contacting AstaPo1 residues revealed their different conservation in AstaP orthologs with the tentative carotenoid-binding function and in FAS1 proteins in general, supporting neofunctionalization of AstaPs within green algae. Correspondingly, a cyanobacterial homolog with a similar domain structure cannot bind carotenoids due to subtle differences in residues decorating the tunnel. These structure-activity relationships inform the sequence-based prediction of the carotenoid-binding FAS1 members.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEA water-soluble astaxanthin-binding protein (AstaP) is a photoprotective protein in green algae helping them to tolerate stress conditions. While belonging to a ubiquitous protein family sharing an ancient structural domain, fasciclin, involved in cell adhesion, AstaP possesses an outstanding ability to bind carotenoid pigments of a different type, which are potent antioxidants. To understand the molecular basis for such carotenoid-binding promiscuity of AstaP, here we determined its spatial structure - the first structure of a carotenoid-protein complex solved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Together with biochemical and sequence conservation analyses, our data illustrate a remarkable case of neofunctionalization of the ancient protein domain and pave the way for its bioengineering and practical use as antioxidant transporter for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial cristae host the respiratory chain complexes composed of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded and nuclear-encoded proteins and are responsible for ATP production. Movement of mtDNA located in the matrix is limited due to blockade by the cristae; yet, the dynamic interaction between the inner membrane and mtDNA remains unknown due to the insufficient spatiotemporal resolution of conventional microscopy and the lack of appropriate in vivo probes targeted to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we developed a novel fluorescence probe to visualize the inner membrane using low-power stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. Dual-color imaging of the inner membrane and mtDNA demonstrated that mtDNA is more likely to spread at mitochondrial tips or branch points under an overall even distribution. Interestingly, exploration of forming this distribution propensity uncovered that the mitochondrial dynamics are closely related to the location of mtDNA, and further insight found that fusion always occurs near mtDNA in order to minimize the pressure for cristae remodeling. In healthy cells, mitochondrial dynamics based on cristae remodeling promotes the even distribution of mtDNA, on the contrary, when cristae structure fails in apoptosis and ferroptosis, leading to mtDNA distribution disorder. Observation of active changes during apoptosis further captured the dynamic process of inner membrane herniation and mtDNA leakage along with cristae remodeling. Under ferroptosis, the mitochondria shrank into ellipsoids and mtDNA converged at the center of mitochondria. The rich dynamics between the cristae and mtDNA, revealed at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, show the motive and outgrowth of mtDNA distribution.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 protects its RNA from being recognized by host immune responses by methylation of its 5 end, also known as capping. This process is carried out by two enzymes, non-structural protein 16 (NSP16) containing 2-O-methyltransferase and NSP14 through its N7 methyltransferase activity, which are essential for the replication of the viral genome as well as evading the hosts innate immunity. NSP10 acts as a crucial cofactor and stimulator of NSP14 and NSP16. To further understand the role of NSP10, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of >13 million globally collected whole-genome sequences (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from the Global Initiative Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and compared it with the reference genome Wuhan/WIV04/2019 to identify all currently known variants in NSP10. T12I, T102I, and A104V in NSP10 have been identified as the three most frequent variants and characterized using X-ray crystallography, biophysical assays and enhanced sampling simulations. In contrast to other proteins such as spike and NSP6, NSP10 is significantly less prone to mutation due to its crucial role in replication. The functional effects of the variants were examined for their impact on the binding affinity and stability of both NSP14-NSP10 and NSP16-NSP10 complexes. These results highlight the limited changes induced by variant evolution in NSP10 and reflect on the critical roles NSP10 plays during the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. These results also indicate that there is limited capacity for the virus to overcome inhibitors targeting NSP10 via the generation of variants in inhibitor binding pockets.\n\nSignificance StatementThe SARS-CoV-2 proteins have constantly been evolving. These variants assist the virus to survive, adapt and evade the host immune responses. While the main focus has been on structural proteins like Spike, there is very limited structural and functional information on the effects of emerging mutations on other essential non-structural viral proteins. One such protein is NSP10, an essential cofactor for NSP14 and NSP16. This study demonstrates that NSP10 is more resistant to genetic variations than other SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins and that the presence of mutations conserve structural and dynamic changes in NSP10. The effects of naturally occurring mutations reflect the evolutionary relationship between structurally conserved essential cofactors, their function and the role they play in the survival of the virus.",

Bromhexine hydrochloride was previously identified as a potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2, an essential protease for ACE-2 virus receptor interactions. In the present study, we investigated whether bromhexine treatment could reduce SARS CoV-2 replication in vitro. To evaluate bromhexines effectiveness against SARS COV-2 infection, viral load was measured using Caco-2 cell lines expressing TMPRSS2. Our molecular docking results indicate that bromhexine displays an affinity with the active site of TMPRSS2. The drug significantly inhibited SARS CoV-2, both parental and P1 variant strains, infection in the Caco-2 cell line, reducing about 40% of SARS-CoV-2 entrance and about 90% of viral progeny in the supernatant 48h post-infection. Furthermore, bromhexine did not exhibit any direct virucidal activity on SARS CoV-2. In conclusion, bromhexine hydrochloride efficiently disrupts SARS CoV-2 infection in vitro and has the potential to become an effective antiviral agent in COVID-19 treatment.",

An important aspect of brain function is the ability to detect salient ambient changes while focusing on a task.

In two studies (total N = 58), we examine electrical brain responses in the frontocentral region to a series of auditory tones, consisting of \"standard\" stimuli (80%) and \"deviant\" stimuli (20%) interspersed randomly, while participants were engaged in various visual tasks. Both studies showed stronger automatic change detection indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN) in lower-SES individuals, regardless of the sounds features, emotional content, or study type. Moreover, we observed a larger MMN in lower-SES participants, even though they did not show differences in brain and behavior responses to the attended task and did not involuntarily orient more attention to deviance, as indexed by the P3a. The study indicates that individuals with lower subjective social status may have an increased ability to automatically detect changes in their environment, which may suggest their adaptation to their childhood environments.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T cells have been successfully used to treat lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma, but adverse effects due to cytokine secretion, CAR-T cell exhaustion, and loss of target antigen have limited their potential. Furthermore, while CARs have been designed to harness T Cell Receptor (TCR) signaling, they are significantly less sensitive than TCRs, resulting in suboptimal signaling. We have developed novel Chimeric Adapter Proteins (CAPs) that are designed to trigger signaling downstream of the TCR{zeta} chain. CAPs are chimeric molecules that contain adapter domains in tandem with the kinase domain of ZAP70, fused to an extracellular targeting domain. We hypothesized that CAPs would be more potent than CARs because kinetic proofreading steps that define the signaling threshold and the inhibitory regulation of upstream molecules are bypassed. Indeed, second generation CAPs exhibited high anti-tumor efficacy, and significantly enhanced long-term in vivo tumor clearance in leukemia-bearing NSG mice as compared with conventional CD19-28{zeta} CAR-T. Mechanistically, CAPs were activated in an Lck-independent manner and displayed slower phosphorylation kinetics and a longer duration of signaling compared with 28{zeta}-CAR. The unique signaling properties of CAPs may therefore be harnessed to improve the in vivo efficacy of T cells engineered to express an anti-tumor chimeric receptor.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae, group B Streptococcus (GBS), is the main bacterial pathogen of cultured Nile tilapia in many countries and causes extensive deaths in all stages of the farming cycle throughout the year. This study investigated the genetic diversity, virulence, presence of antibiotic resistance genes and antimicrobial susceptibility of 72 GBS linked to mass mortalities of cultured Nile tilapia in Brazil. Isolate identity was confirmed by morphological, biochemical and molecular analyses. Capsular serotype, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) allelic profiles and putative pathogenic factors were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gel electrophoresis, sequencing and molecular analyses of different genes. The presence of antimicrobial resistance genes and antimicrobial susceptibility to florfenicol (FFC), oxytetracycline (OTC), thiamphenicol (TAP) and their combination were evaluated by PCR, followed by gel electrophoresis, and broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing, respectively. All clinical isolates studied were confirmed to be GBS, one from serotype III (IA2022) and 71 from serotype Ib, suggesting that serotype Ib was the most prevalent strain between 2011 and 2016 in the south and southern and southeastern regions of Brazil. Eight different allelic profiles were identified for the first time, being adhP- 52, pheS-2, atr-31, glnA-4, sdhA-2, tkt-19 the most predominant. Between one (glcK) and three (adhP and glnA) alleles were present at each locus. All strains, except IA2022, showed a partial gene deletion event on the glcK gene. The surface protein Rib and hypervirulent GBS adhesin BibA were detected in all strains, except for 18P, which was negative for rib. On the other hand,  and {beta} antigens of the C protein were only detected in IA2022. All antimicrobials showed high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC [&ge;] 16 {micro}g/mL) values against several strains with negative results for resistance genes. Despite indifference and antagonism being the most predominant activities in all combinations evaluated, the record of synergism, including in a strain with a resistance gene and phenotypic resistance, suggests that combination therapy can have therapeutic efficacy when well planned. The combination involving OTC and TAP or FFC is a likely candidate for improving the treatment of streptococcosis using combination therapy, even for strains showing phenotypic and genotypic resistance to OTC. This study provides pertinent data on pathogenic GBS genetic diversity, virulence, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and antimicrobial susceptibility, which may be useful in the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic strategies for the prevention and control of streptococcosis in aquaculture farms.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to characterize the ovarian, tubal and uterine morphology in the insectivorous bat Pteronotus gymnonotus, in specimens collected in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. After euthanasia, these organs were histologically processed for inclusion in historesin for morphological and morphometric analysis under light microscopy. The morphological characterization of the ovaries was based on the development of the oocyte and follicle growth, while the uterine tubes were characterized in terms of their anatomy and division of their parts into: infundibulum, ampulla and isthmus, where the height of the tubal epithelium and muscle layer thickness. The analysis of the uterus was based on the formation and thickness of its three layers: endometrium, myometrium and perimetrium. Morphometric analyzes were performed by capturing images of histological slides at different magnifications. The variables were submitted to descriptive analysis, with data expressed as mean and standard deviation. It was observed that the ovaries are bilateral and oval, presenting a squamous to simple cubic epithelium, forming the germinal epithelium, certain stratification regarding the location of the ovarian follicles, where most of the primordial follicles are arranged in the peripheral region of the ovary, however being it is possible to identify many follicles in various stages of maturation in the central region; the uterus is bicornuate and the layers of the uterus and uterine tubes observed follow the same pattern of other eutherian mammals. This information is important to allow comparisons between species, aiming at knowledge about reproductive morphology in mammals, especially those belonging to the order Chiroptera. Therefore, this research is essential to subsidize conservation measures that protect their natural populations, in an effort to maintain the ecological balance.",

A wealth of interesting novel viruses is revealed, including members of Nucleocytoviricota, Lavidaviridae, and polinton-like viruses, which are taxa containing previously characterized algal viruses. Our sequencing results are coupled with a virus targeted qPCR study and 18S rDNA metabarcoding to elucidate potential virus-host interactions. Several species of green algae are identified (Chlorophyta), likely representing the alternating dominant populations during the year of study. Finally, we observe a bloom of viral diversity within the family Phycodnaviridae (Nucleocytoviricota), including highly related but non-identical genotypes, appearing in the HRAP in September and October 2018. This bloom is most likely the cause of a mass mortality event of the cultured algae that occurred during these same months. We hypothesize that these related Phycodnaviridae lineages selectively infect different strains of the same algal species of the Genus Picochlorum that have been identified in the HRAP by metabarcoding and coined this phenomenon a \"quasigenus\" by analogy to the RNA virus quasispecies concept.",

Human ABC transporter ABCC4 that pumps out the platelet agonist and anti-platelet drug such as aspirin, might become a promising target for preventing cardiovascular diseases. Here we solve the structures of human ABCC4 in the apo and two complexed forms, all of which adopt a typical architecture of type-IV ABC transporters in an inward-facing conformation. Structure of ABCC4 complexed with U46619, an analog of the unstable TXA2, provides the first structural evidence that the platelet agonist TXA2 is also exported via ABCC4. The dipyridamole-complexed structure reveals the inhibitory mechanism of dipyridamole against ABCC4. Structural comparisons enabled us to identify a transmembrane pocket in ABCC4 that provides a defined space for the rational design of specific anti-platelet drugs.",

    "abstract": "Next generation RNA sequencing allows alternative splicing (AS) quantification with unprecedented resolution, with the relative inclusion of an alternative sequence in transcripts being commonly quantified by the proportion of reads supporting it as percent spliced-in (PSI). However, PSI values do not incorporate information about precision, proportional to the respective AS events read coverage. Beta distributions are suitable to quantify inclusion levels of alternative sequences, using reads supporting their inclusion and exclusion as surrogates for the two distribution shape parameters. Each such beta distribution has the PSI as its mean value and is narrower when the read coverage is higher, facilitating the interpretability of its precision when plotted. We herein introduce a computational pipeline, based on beta distributions accurately modelling PSI values and their precision, to quantitatively and visually compare AS between groups of samples. Our methodology includes a differential splicing significance metric that compromises the magnitude of inter-group differences, the estimation uncertainty in individual samples, and the intra-group variability, being therefore suitable to multiple-group comparisons. To make our approach accessible and clear to both non-computational and computational biologists, we developed betAS, an interactive web app and user-friendly R package for visual and intuitive differential splicing analysis from read count data.",

Furthermore, by protein mass spectrometry, we found that FCGRT can combine with CIgG. However, the study of FCGRT in glioma has not been reported. We used the CGGA325, TCGA dataset and immunohistochemistry to verify the importance of FCGRT on the prognosis of glioma patients. Single cell sequencing data analysis evaluated that the role of FCGRT in the microenvironment of glioma. Estimate, ssGSEA, EPIC and xCell were used for immune infiltration analysis. FCGRT was knocked down in U251 cells to detect the effect of FCGRT on the malignant development of glioma. These results showed that patients with higher FCGRT expression had a shorter overall survival. FCGRT was closely related to the tumor microenvironment, especially to macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (r=0.743, p<0.001). Interestingly we also found that FCGRT was positively correlated with IGHG1. Finally, we found that knock-down of FCGRT resulted in a decrease in proliferation, migration and invasion of U251 cells. Taken together, we believe that FCGRT is an independent prognostic factor for glioma patients, and its possible mechanism is to promote proliferation and invasion of tumor cells by interacting with CIgG.",

To this end, we develop a graph attention neural network STAligner for integrating and aligning ST datasets, enabling spatially-aware data integration, simultaneous spatial domain identification, and downstream comparative analysis. We apply STAligner to the integrative analysis of ST datasets of the human cortex slices from different samples, the mouse olfactory bulb slices generated by two profiling technologies, the mouse hippocampus tissue slices under normal and Alzheimers disease conditions, and the spatiotemporal atlases of mouse organogenesis. STAligner efficiently captures the shared tissue structures across different slices, the disease-related substructures, and the dynamical changes during mouse embryonic development. Additionally, the shared spatial domain and nearest neighbor pairs identified by STAligner can be further considered as corresponding pairs to guide the three-dimensional reconstruction of consecutive slices, achieving more accurate local structure-guided registration results than the existing method.",

    "abstract": "In a recent study (doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0265662), associations were identified between owner-reported dog health status and their diet, whereby those fed either raw food or a vegan diet were perceived to be healthier. However, the study was limited because possible confounding from variables not included in the analysis was not considered. The aim of the current study was to extend the earlier findings, using different modelling techniques and including multiple variables, to identify the most important predictors of owner-reported dog health.\n\nFrom the original dataset, two binary health outcome variables were created: the  any healthcare problem distinguished those that were healthy (\"no\") from with those with illness of any severity, whilst the  significant illness variable distinguished those that were either healthy or had mild illness (\"no\") from those with significant or serious illness (\"yes\"). Associations between these health outcomes and both owner-animal metadata and healthcare variables were assessed using logistic regression and machine learning predictive modelling using XGBoost.\n\nFor the  any health problem outcome, best-fit models for both logistic regression (pseudo R2 0.428, P<0.001) and XGBoost (AUC 0.838, 99%-CI: 0.794-0.882) contained the variables dog age, number of veterinary visits and receiving medication. Several other variables were also included in the XGBoost model, albeit having limited although their importance was limited. For the  significant illness outcome, dog age, veterinary visits and receiving medication were again the most important predictors for both logistic regression (R2 0.349, P<0.001) and XGBoost (AUC 0.871, 99%-CI: 0.799-0.944), whilst location (UK) also featured in the latter. No other variable was of sufficient importance to be included in the final model.\n\nThe results of the current study conflict with previously-published research using the same dataset and suggest that diet the fed has limited impact on owner-perceived dog health status; instead, dog age, frequency of veterinary visits and receiving medication are most important.",

    "abstract": "Parental care is required to ensure the health and survival of offspring. Caretaking in mammals is challenging as infants are largely helpless and require near-continual oversight over prolonged periods. Mouse pups in particular cannot thermoregulate, and will succumb to hypothermia unless kept warm by an adult caretaker or an insulating nest. Parents must balance caretaking behaviors with other activities important for survival such as regulating their own temperature and foraging for food or water, which necessarily involve periods of pup neglect. To understand in high detail the consequential decision-making involved in care of infant pups, we built a new system for long-term 24/7 continuous monitoring of mouse homecage behaviors, including thermal imaging, video recording from above, side and directly under the nest, with environmental controls to standardize housing conditions across animals. We monitored single dams and their offspring, before, during and after parturition, from initial mating over four consecutive litters. We found that about half of the animals had high litter survival rates ( high-pup-survival dams) but the other half had little to no pups survive ( low-pup-survival dams). The relative amount of litter survival did not change or improve across litters in absence of intervention: Low-pup-survival dams continued to neglect pups and nest-building across litters, losing nearly all offspring within a day after birth. We could predict which animals would become low-pup-survival dams by inspecting the nests they built a few days before parturition. Low-pup-survival dams minimally engaged with nest building, and after birth, generally avoided pups and the nest. Nest quality deteriorated due to movement of the dam in and out of the nest, exacerbating temperature loss and mortality of the litter. In contrast, high-pup-survival dams spent a considerable amount of time rebuilding and adjusting the nest over the first postnatal day and beyond. Remarkably, if we co-housed low-pup-survival dams with a high-pup-survival dam and her litter, when the low-pup-survival dam was bred again and singly-housed, litter survival rates thereafter were consistently much higher along with increased attention toward pups and nest. Thus, even under well-controlled and ideal lab housing conditions, mouse maternal care can be remarkably variable, with continued nest rebuilding as the most important factor in ensuring high litter survival rates. Furthermore, despite some animals perseverating in maternal neglect and losing their pups, caretaking and nest-building can improve after interactions with experienced and successful parents.",

    "abstract": "Organisms continuously modify their environment, often impacting the fitness of future conspecifics due to ecological inheritance. When this inheritance is biased towards kin, selection favours modifications that increase the fitness of downstream individuals. How such selection shapes trait variation within populations remains poorly understood. Using mathematical modelling, we investigate the coevolution of multiple traits in a group-structured population when these traits affect the group environment, which is then bequeathed to future generations. We examine when such coevolution favours polymorphism as well as the resulting associations among traits. We find in particular that two traits become associated when one trait affects the environment while the other influences the likelihood that future kin experience this environment. To illustrate this, we model the coevolution of (a) the attack rate on a local renewable resource, which deteriorates environmental conditions, with (b) dispersal between groups, which reduces the likelihood that kin suffers from such deterioration. We show this often leads to the emergence of two highly-differentiated morphs: one that readily disperses and depletes local resources; and another that maintains these resources and tends to remain philopatric. More broadly, we suggest that ecological inheritance can contribute to phenotypic diversity and lead to complex polymorphism.",

Here, a thorough and systematic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study is conducted to investigate how the RBD mutations on these subvariants affect the interactions with broad mAbs including AstraZeneca (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130), Brii Biosciences (BRII-196), Celltrion (CT-P59), Eli Lilly (LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016), Regeneron (REGN10933 and REGN10987), Vir Biotechnology (S309), and S2X259. Our results show a complete loss of binding for COV2-2196, BRII-196, CT-P59, and LY-CoV555 with all Omicron RBDs. REGN10987 also loses its binding against BA.1 but partially retains against BA.2 and BA.4/5. The reduction in binding is either significant for LY-CoV016 and REGN10933 or moderate for COV2-2130. S309 and S2X259 retain their binding strength against BA.1 but decrease against others. We introduce a mutational escape map for each mAb to identify the key RBD sites and critical mutation. Overall, our findings suggest that majority of therapeutic mAbs have diminished or lost their activity against Omicron subvariants, indicating the urgent need for a new therapeutic mAb, modifying current ones with a better mAb design, or seeking an alternative approach.",

    "abstract": "Several efforts to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 treatment have largely either failed to identify a suitable agent or agents identified did not translate to clinical use; either because of demonstrated lack of clinical efficacy in trials, inappropriate dose requirements and probably use of inappropriate pre-clinical laboratory surrogates of effectiveness. In this study, we used an innovative algorithm, that incorporates dissemination and implementation considerations, to identify potential drugs for COVID-19 using iterative computational and wet laboratory methods that highlight inhibition of viral induced cytopathic effect (CPE) as a laboratory surrogate of effectiveness. Erythromycin, pyridoxine, folic acid and retapamulin were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE in Vero cells at concentrations that are clinically achievable. Additional studies may be required to further characterize the inhibitions of CPE and the possible mechanisms.\n\nFundingTETFund Covid-19 Special Intervention Research grant(grant number TETFund/DR&D/CE/ SI/COVID-19/UDUS/VOL 1)",

    "abstract": "Social behaviors, like other motivated behaviors, frequently consist of a flexible motivated-seeking or approach phase followed by social action. Dysregulated social behavior may arise from changes to motivation, wherein individuals fail to enter a motivated seeking state, or may be in the execution of the social action itself. However, it is unclear how the brain generates and gates this flexible motivation-to-action sequence, and whether aggressive motivation and action are controlled by separate circuit mechanisms. Here, we record populations of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateral area (VMHvl) of male mice at cellular resolution during \"free\" aggression and also during an aggression operant task, where the behaviors that precede attack are stereotyped. We find that this population encodes the temporal sequence of aggressive motivation to action and that the temporal selectivity of neurons is invariant to differences in motivated behavior. To test whether motivation and action could be independently regulated, we focused on two key inhibitory inputs to the VMHvl: a source of local inhibition (VMHvl shell) and the primary source of long-range inhibition (the medial preoptic area, MPO). While we find that the VMHvl receives broad monosynaptic inhibitory input from both inputs, optogenetic perturbation of these inputs during recording reveals temporal selectivity during aggressive motivation and action, suggesting specificity of function. Encoding models applied to population calcium recordings of these inhibitory inputs during naturalistic social interactions and during the social operant task further reveal that these inputs have different temporal dynamics during aggression: VMHvl shellvgat+ activity peaks at the start of aggressive interactions, while MPO-VMHvlvgat+ activity peaks at behaviorally aligned endpoints of aggressive interactions. Finally, using closed-loop optogenetic stimulation timed to specific phases of the aggression-operant task, we find a double-dissociation of the effects on aggressive motivation and action: activation of MPO-VMHvlvgat+, even briefly and temporally distant from the initiation of aggression, produces long-lasting motivational deficits, delaying the initiation of aggression and generating behaviors consistent with an unmotivated state. In contrast, activation of VMHvl shellvgat+ produces acute action-related deficits, causing an exit from an attack state. Fitting a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to behavior further corroborates these findings by showing that MPO-VMHvlvgat+ stimulation prolongs a low motivation state and VMHvl shellvgat+ promotes exit from an attack state. Together, these data demonstrate how separable inhibitory circuits in the hypothalamus can independently gate the motivational and action phases of aggression through a single locus of control.",

    "abstract": "The Na+ channels that are important for action potentials show rapid inactivation, a state in which they do not conduct, although the membrane potential remains depolarized1,2. Rapid inactivation is a determinant of millisecond scale phenomena, such as spike shape and refractory period. Na+ channels also inactivate orders of magnitude more slowly, and therefore have impacts on excitability over much longer time scales than those of a single spike or a single inter-spike interval3-9. Here, we focus on the contribution of slow inactivation to the resilience of axonal excitability10,11 when ion channels are unevenly distributed across the axonal membrane. We study models in which the voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels are unevenly distributed along axons with different variances, capturing the heterogeneity that biological axons display12. In the absence of slow inactivation many conductance distributions result in spontaneous tonic activity. Faithful axonal propagation is achieved with the introduction of Na+ channel slow inactivation. This \"normalization\" effect depends on relations between the kinetics of slow inactivation and the firing frequency. Consequently, neurons with characteristically different firing frequencies will need to implement different sets of channel properties to achieve resilience. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of the intrinsic biophysical properties of ion channels in normalizing axonal function.\n\nHighlightsO_LIVariation in ion channel density in axons may compromise axonal spike propagation.\nC_LIO_LISlow inactivation of Na+ channels modulates their availability.\nC_LIO_LINa+ channel slow inactivation increases the reliability of spike propagation.\nC_LIO_LINormalization by slow inactivation can compensate for uneven channel distributions.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The asymmetric morphology of the mammalian heart is essential to its function as the organ of pulmonary and systemic double circulation. Left-right asymmetry is established by a leftward flow in the node that results in the asymmetric expression of Nodal. This triggers a cascade of asymmetric expression of downstream genes, such as Pitx2c, in the lateral plate mesoderm that gives rise to the first morphologically recognizable primordial heart structure, the cardiac crescent. Relatively little is known about gene expression asymmetries in the cardiac crescent that might underpin asymmetric cardiac morphogenesis. To systematically identify asymmetrically expressed genes, we performed a single-cell transcriptional analysis of manually dissected left and right halves of the cardiac crescent at stages spanning symmetry breaking. This revealed both left and right-sided genes that have not previously been implicated in left-right symmetry breaking. Some of these were expressed in multiple cell types but showed asymmetric expression in only a sub-set of cell types. We validated these findings using multiplexed in situ Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) and high-resolution volume imaging to characterize the expression patterns of select genes. Using Dnahiv/iv mutant embryos that show randomized situs, we established that all the genes tested tracked the asymmetric expression of Pitx2c, indicating their asymmetric expression also arose from the early asymmetries at the node. This study provides a high-fidelity molecular characterization of left-right symmetry breaking during cardiac crescent formation, providing a basis for future mechanistic studies on asymmetric cardiac morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain depends on their activation frequency and division mode. We use long-term intravital imaging of NSCs in the zebrafish adult telencephalon to link activation and division mode with predictive cellular and molecular parameters. We reveal that apical surface area and expression of the Notch ligand DeltaA predict NSC activation frequency, while deltaA expression marks NSC commitment to neurogenesis. We also find that deltaA-negative NSCs constitute the bona fide self-renewing NSC pool and systematically engage in asymmetric divisions generating a self-renewing deltaAneg and a neurogenic deltaApos NSC. Finally, modulation of Notch signaling during imaging indicates that the prediction of activation frequency by apical size, and the asymmetric divisions of deltaAneg NSCs, are functionally independent of Notch. These results provide dynamic qualitative and quantitative readouts of NSC lineage progression in vivo and support a hierarchical organization of NSCs in differently fated sub-populations.",
