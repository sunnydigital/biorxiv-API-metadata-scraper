    "abstract": "DNA binding proteins are essential for cellular life, but persistently bound complexes have toxic consequences. Here we show that the proteotoxic responsive bacterial protease Lon clears proteins from DNA to promote genotoxic stress resistance. Purified Lon binds DNA and degrades neighboring bound proteins, while a fully active DNA-blind Lon variant does not. This variant can degrade substrates as normal during unstressed growth, complements pleotropic phenotypes of {Delta}lon, including proteotoxic resilience, but remains sensitive to genotoxic stresses and fails to degrade proteins efficiently during DNA damage. Transposon sequencing reveals that {Delta}lon is vulnerable to loss of protein-DNA eviction factors and we use dynamic nucleoid occupancy profiling to show that chromosome-wide protein turnover relies on Lon DNA binding. Finally, disrupting Lon binding to mitochondria genomes also results in genotoxic stress sensitivity, consistent with the bacterial ancestry of this organelle. We propose that clearance of persistent proteins from DNA by Lon originated in free-living -proteobacteria and maintained during the evolution of mitochondria.\n\nSummaryDNA binding by the Lon protease protects against genotoxic damage in a manner preserved from bacteria to mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "The use of blood-based extracellular RNA (cell-free RNA; exRNA) as clinical biomarker requires the implementation of a validated procedure for sample collection, processing, and profiling. So far, no study has systematically addressed the pre-analytical variables affecting transcriptome analysis of exRNAs. In the exRNAQC study, we evaluated ten blood collection tubes, three time intervals between blood draw and downstream processing, and eight RNA purification methods using the supplier-specified minimum and maximum biofluid input volumes. The impact of these pre-analytics on deep transcriptome profiling of both small and messenger RNA from healthy donors plasma or serum was assessed for each pre-analytical variable separately and for interactions between a selected set of pre-analytics, resulting in 456 extracellular transcriptomes. Making use of 189 synthetic spike-in RNAs, the processing and analysis workflow was controlled. When comparing blood collection tubes, so-called preservation tubes do not stabilize exRNA well, and result in variable RNA concentration and sensitivity (i.e., the number of detected RNAs) over time, as well as compromised reproducibility. We also document large differences in RNA purification kit performance in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility, and observed transcriptome complexity, and demonstrate interactions between specific blood collection tubes, purification kits and time intervals. Our results are summarized in 11 performance metrics that enable an informed selection of the most optimal sample processing workflow for a given experiment. In conclusion, we put forward robust quality control metrics for exRNA quantification methods with validated standard operating procedures (SOPs), representing paramount groundwork for future exRNA-based precision medicine applications.",

    "abstract": "Here we present a more interpretable and versatile approach for reconstructing the contents of perception, attention, and memory from neuroimaging data. Our enhanced inverted encoding model (eIEM) incorporates theoretical and methodological improvements including proper accounting of population-level tuning functions and a trial-by-trial prediction error-based metric where reconstruction quality is measured in meaningful units. Added functionality and improved flexibility is further gained via eIEMs novel goodness-of-fit feature: for trial-by-trial reconstructions, goodness-of-fits are obtained independently (non-circularly) to prediction error and can be applied to any IEM procedure or decoding metric, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and brain-behavior correlations, and more creative applications. We validate eIEM from methodological principles, simulated neuroimaging datasets, and three pre-existing fMRI datasets spanning perception, attention, and working memory. Notably, eIEM is easy to apply and broadly accessible - our Python package (https://pypi.org/project/inverted-encoding) implements eIEM in one line of code - and is easily modifiable to compare performance metrics and/or scale up to more complex models.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is regulated by the homeostatic system and the circadian clock. The circadian clock governs the timing of sleep-wake cycles and the homeostatic mechanisms modulate the amount and depth of sleep. Caffeine intake promotes wakefulness in Drosophila. In humans, caffeine is consumed on a daily basis and hence it is important to understand the effect of prolonged caffeine intake on both circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep. Furthermore, sleep changes with age and the impact of caffeine on age dependent sleep fragmentation is yet to be understood. Hence in the present study, we examined the effect of short exposure to caffeine on homeostatic sleep and age dependent sleep fragmentation in Drosophila. We further assessed the effect of prolonged exposure to caffeine on homeostatic sleep and circadian clock in Drosophila. The results of our study showed that short exposure to caffeine reduces sleep in flies and enhances sleep fragmentation with increasing age. On the other hand, prolonged caffeine exposure did not exert any significant effect on duration of sleep in mature flies. Nevertheless, prolonged caffeine ingestion decreased the morning and evening anticipatory activity in these flies indicating that it affects the circadian rhythm. These flies also exhibited phase delay in the clock gene timeless transcript oscillation and altered behavioral rhythm with either a longer free running period or arrhythmicity under constant darkness. In summary, the results of our studies showed that short exposure to caffeine increases the sleep fragmentation with age whereas prolonged caffeine exposure disrupts the circadian clock.\n\nStatement of SignificanceIn the present study, we assessed the effect of duration of caffeine intake on age dependent sleep fragmentation and circadian clock by using Drosophila as a model organism. We found that short exposure to caffeine reduced sleep and food intake in flies. It also increased the sleep fragmentation with age. On the other hand prolonged caffeine exposure did not affect the sleep and feeding indicating that these flies developed tolerance to caffeine. As in mammals, caffeine slows down the circadian clock in flies. Most importantly, prolonged caffeine treatment disrupted the circadian rhythm in Drosophila. Our studies provide new insights into the differential effect of duration of caffeine intake on circadian clock and sleep.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Ra strain has been reported to rapidly enter the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state following treatment with an NADH oxidase inhibitor (diphenyleneiodonium [DPI]) and to be reactivated by fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, the mechanism underlying FBS-induced reactivation is unclear. We tried to reveal the mechanism of FBS-induced reactivation using M. tuberculosis H37Rv.\n\nMethodsFirst, we evaluated the effect of DPI on culturability, viability and changes of acid-fastness toward H37Rv. Secondly, we measured the reactivation-promoting effects of human serum albumin, egg-white albumin and antioxidative agents in DPI-induced VBNC cells. We also inhibited adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase which is the downstream of adenylyl cyclase to evaluate the influence to reactivation capacity of bovine serum albumin (BSA).\n\nResultsDPI treatment induced VBNC state in H37Rv, resulting in a high proportion of viable cells but a low proportion of culturable cells, loss of acid-fastness and lipid-accumulation. Not only FBS but also BSA alone could reactivate H37Rv. Contrary to our expectation, only human serum albumin had a similar restorative effect to BSA. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by SQ22536 did not have a significant effect on reactivation; however, the inhibition of mycobacterial protein kinase by H89 and staurosporine strongly suppressed the BSA-induced reactivation.\n\nConclusionDPI-induced VBNC Mtb cells may be reactivated via the activation of protein kinase-dependent cell division processes through interaction with BSA.",

The relative frequencies of these pathways are thought to primarily depend on genomic sequence and cell state contexts, limiting control over mutational outcomes. Here we report that engineered Cas9 nucleases that create different DNA break structures engage competing repair pathways at dramatically altered frequencies. We accordingly designed a Cas9 variant (vCas9) that produces breaks which suppress otherwise dominant nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. Instead, breaks created by vCas9 are predominantly repaired by pathways utilizing homologous sequences, specifically microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Consequently, vCas9 enables efficient precise editing through HDR or MMEJ while suppressing indels caused by NHEJ in dividing and non-dividing cells. These findings establish a new paradigm of targeted nucleases custom-designed for specific mutational applications.\n\nTeaserCRISPR-Cas9 can be designed to make otherwise infrequent precise editing pathways dominant in dividing and non-dividing cells",

    "abstract": "Previous research favours the idea that modern humans spread worldwide from Africa. For instance, through autosomal diversity, an area of origin for this worldwide expansion is indicated to entirely be within Africa. It remained to be seen if this indication happens for certain variables such as Y-chromosomal diversity. There is disagreement regarding where in Africa the origin is. Support for a region could reflect non-African ancestry rather than the expansion. The present research considered whether some genetic and cranial variables indicate the expansion, and, furthermore, where in Africa the expansion started. Variables included, for example, autosomal diversity (in sub-Saharan Africa) which was adjusted for non-African ancestry, Y-chromosomal diversity, and cranial sexual size dimorphism. For each, it was seen if the estimated area of origin was solely in Africa. Moreover, to generally estimate the origin, a centroid was calculated from potential origins which were obtained in the present, and past, research. The area of origin was completely within Africa for each variable except one - for Y-chromosomal diversity, the area was possibly in Asia only. The centroid of the potential origins was in southern Africa. The autosomal diversity of sub-Saharan African populations, adjusted for non-African ancestry, indicated a southern African origin. This adjusted diversity appeared to start declining from about 2,000-3,000 km away from the origin; the non-linearity may be explained by travels after the expansion, or the expansion entering locations in Africa which were already populated, to differing extents, by modern humans. Southern Africa is perhaps where the expansion began.",

    "abstract": "Peritoneal metastases (PM) are one of the most common routes of dissemination for colorectal cancer (CRC) and remain a lethal disease with a poor prognosis. The compositional, mechanical and structural properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in cancer development; studying how these properties change during the progression of the disease is crucial to understand CRC-PM development.\n\nThe elastic properties of ECMs derived from human samples of normal and neoplastic PM in different pathological conditions were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM); results were correlated to patients clinical data and to the expression of ECM components related to metastatic spread.\n\nOur results show that PM progression is accompanied by stiffening of ECM as a common feature; spatially resolved mechanical analysis highlighted significant spatial heterogeneity of the elastic properties of both normal and neoplastic ECMs, which show significant overlap in the two conditions. On the micrometre scale, ECMs that are considered normal according to the pathological classification possess stiffer spatial domains, which are typically associated with cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) activity and tumour development in neoplastic matrices; on the other hand, softer regions are found in neoplastic ECMs on the same scales. Our results support the hypothesis that local changes (stiffening) in the normal ECM can create the ground for growth and spread from the tumour of invading metastatic cells.\n\nMechanical changes correlate well with the presence of CAF and an increase in collagen deposition, which are well known markers of cancer progression. Furthermore, we have found correlations between the mechanical properties of the ECM and patients clinical data like age, sex, presence of mutations in BRAF and KRAS genes and tumour grade.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that the mechanical phenotyping of the PM-ECM has the potential for predicting tumour development.",

However, the exact nature of these interactions remains poorly understood. Is the presence of identity-relevant object information in the dorsal pathway simply a byproduct of ventral input? Or, might the dorsal pathway be a source of input to the ventral pathway for object recognition? In the current study, we used high-density EEG - a technique with high temporal precision and spatial resolution sufficient to distinguish parietal and temporal lobes - to characterize the dynamics of dorsal and ventral pathways during object viewing. Using multivariate analyses, we found that category decoding in the dorsal pathway preceded that in the ventral pathway. Importantly, the dorsal pathway predicted the multivariate responses of the ventral pathway in a time-dependent manner, rather than the other way around. Together, these findings suggest that the dorsal pathway is a critical source of input to the ventral pathway for object recognition.",

    "abstract": "Alloreactivity can drive autoimmune syndromes. After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), a B cell-mediated autoimmune-like syndrome, commonly occurs. Because donor-derived B cells continually develop under selective pressure from host alloantigens, aberrant B Cell Receptor (BCR)-activation and IgG production can emerge and contribute to cGVHD pathobiology. To better understand molecular programing of B cells under selective pressure of alloantigens, we performed scRNA-Seq analysis on high numbers of purified B cells from allo-HCT patients. An unsupervised analysis revealed 10 clusters, distinguishable by signature genes for maturation, activation and memory. We found striking transcriptional differences in the  memory B cell compartment after allo-HCT compared to healthy or infected individuals. To identify intrinsic properties when B-cell tolerance is lost after allo-HCT, we then assessed clusters for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with vs. without autoimmune-like manifestations (Active cGVHD vs. No cGVHD, respectively). DEGs were found in Active cGVHD in both naive and BCR-activated clusters, suggesting functional diversity. Some DEGs were also differentially expressed across most clusters, suggesting common molecular programs that may promote B cell  plasticity. Our study of human allo-HCT and cGVHD provides new understanding of B-cell  memory in the face of chronic alloantigen stimulation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryOur scRNA-Seq study of purified B cells after allo-HCT clarifies molecular differences in human B cell subsets when immune tolerance is lost or maintained.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/512162v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c452eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c1d34borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@171310org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4bf15_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The circulating human B cell compartment under the selective pressure of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HCT) has an intrinsically altered memory B cell pool. In allo-HCT, genetically disparate donor stem and progenitor cells engraft, regenerating a new peripheral B cell compartment in the host. During ongoing B lymphopoiesis and diversification, selective pressure from alloantigens and other extrinsic factors, including B Cell Activating Factor (BAFF), result in either B cell maturation and immune tolerance (No Chronic GVHD) or altered B cell homeostasis and autoimmune manifestations (Active Chronic GVHD). B cells within defined subsets in patients with Active GVHD have distinct intrinsic programs delineated by differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Some DEGs occur across nearly all B cell subsets ( Differentially Expressed Broadly), while other DEGs are more restricted within only one or a few B cell subsets ( Naive,  BCR-activated, or  Memory).

    "abstract": "Voluntary movements are prepared before they are executed. Preparatory activity has been observed across the CNS and recently documented in first order neurons of the human PNS i.e., in muscle spindles. The changes seen in these sensory organs suggest that the independent modulation of stretch reflex gains may represent an important component of movement preparation. The aim of the current study was to further investigate the preparatory modulation of short- and long-latency stretch reflex responses ( SLR and  LLR) of the dominant upper limb. Specifically, we investigated how different target parameters (target distance and direction) affect the preparatory tuning of stretch reflex gains in the context of goal-directed reaching, and whether any such tuning depends on preparation duration and the direction of background loads. We found that target distance produced only small variations in reflex gains. In contrast, both SLR and LLR gains were strongly modulated as a function of target direction, in a manner that facilitated the upcoming voluntary movement. This goal-directed tuning of SLR and LLR gains was present or enhanced when the preparatory delay was sufficiently long (>250 ms) and the homonymous muscle was unloaded i.e., when a background load was first applied in the direction of homonymous muscle action (assistive loading). The results extend further support for a relatively slow-evolving process in reach preparation that functions to modulate reflexive muscle stiffness, likely via the independent control of fusimotor neurons. Such control can augment voluntary goal-directed movement and is triggered or enhanced when the homonymous muscle is unloaded.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is well-known that movement preparation improves motor performance. That is, briefly delaying the onset of a goal-directed movement can significantly benefit the overall quality of movement. However, the mechanisms underlying movement preparation remain unclear. In this study we examined the preparatory modulation of short- and long-latency stretch reflex responses in the dominant upper limb. We found that goal-directed tuning of stretch reflex gains is consistently triggered or enhanced in cases where preparation is sufficiently long (>250 ms) and a background - assistive- load is first applied in the direction of homonymous muscle action. A better understanding of movement preparation will likely also benefit the development of rehabilitation regimes and movement augmentation devices.",

    "abstract": "Animal development and homeostasis critically depend on the accurate regulation of gene transcription, which includes the silencing of genes that should not be expressed. Repression is mediated by a specific class of transcription factors (TFs) termed repressors that, via the recruitment of co-repressors (CoRs), can dominantly prevent transcription, even in the presence of activating cues. However, the relationship between specific CoRs and enhancers has remained unclear. Here, we used functional genomics to uncover regulatory specificities between CoRs and enhancers. We show that enhancers can typically be repressed by only a subset of CoRs. Enhancers classified by CoR sensitivity also show distinct biological functions and endogenous chromatin features. Moreover, enhancers that are sensitive or resistant to silencing by specific CoRs differ in TF motif content, and their sensitivity to CoRs can be predicted based on TF motif content. Finally, we identified and validated specific TF motifs that have a direct impact on enhancers sensitivity or resistance towards specific CoRs, using large scale motif mutagenesis and addition experiments.\n\nThis study reveals the existence of TF motif-based regulatory rules that coordinate CoRs-enhancer compatibilities. These specificities between repressors and activators not only suggest that repression occurs via distinct mechanisms, but also provide an additional layer in transcriptional regulation that allows for differential repression at close genomic distances and offers multiple ways for de-repression.",

    "abstract": "Chronic imaging experiments in mice have revealed that the hippocampal code drifts over long time scales. Specifically, the subset of cells which are active on any given session in a familiar environment changes over the course of days and weeks. While some cells transition into or out of the code after a few sessions, others are stable over the entire experiment. Similar representational drift has also been observed in other cortical areas, raising the possibility of a common underlying mechanism, which, however, remains unknown. Here we show, through quantitative fitting of a network model to experimental data, that the statistics of representational drift in CA1 pyramidal cells are consistent with ongoing synaptic turnover in the main excitatory inputs to a neuronal circuit operating in the balanced regime. We find two distinct time-scales of drift: a fast shift in overall excitability with characteristic time-scale of two days, and a slower drift in spatially modulated input on the order of about one month. The observed heterogeneity in single-cell properties, including long-term stability, are explained by variability arising from random changes in the number of active inputs to cells from one session to the next. We furthermore show that these changes are, in turn, consistent with an ongoing process of learning via a Hebbian plasticity rule. We conclude that representational drift is the hallmark of a memory system which continually encodes new information.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput genotyping enables the large-scale analysis of genetic diversity in population genomics and genomewide association studies that combine the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of large collections of accessions. Sequencing-based approaches for genotyping are progressively replacing traditional genotyping methods due to the lower ascertainment bias. However, genome-wide genotyping based on sequencing becomes expensive in species with large genomes and a high proportion of repetitive DNA. Here we describe the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete repetitive elements in the 3.76-Gb genome of lentil (Lens culinaris), 84% consisting of repeats, thus concentrating the sequencing data on coding and regulatory regions (single-copy regions). We designed a custom set of 566,766 gRNAs targeting 2.9 Gbp of repeats and excluding repetitive regions overlapping annotated genes and putative regulatory elements based on ATAC-Seq data. The novel depletion method removed [~]40% of reads mapping to repeats, increasing those mapping to single-copy regions by [~]2.6-fold. When analyzing 25 million fragments, this repeat-to-single-copy shift in the sequencing data increased the number of genotyped bases of [~]10-fold compared to non-depleted libraries. In the same condition, we were also able to identify [~]12-fold more genetic variants in the single-copy regions and increased the genotyping accuracy by rescuing thousands of heterozygous variants that otherwise would be missed due to low coverage. The method performed similarly regardless of the multiplexing level, type of library or genotypes, including different cultivars and a closely-related species (L. orientalis). Our results demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-driven repeat depletion focuses sequencing data on meaningful genomic regions, thus improving high-density and genome-wide genotyping in large and repetitive genomes.",

    "abstract": "This paper suggests an explanation for listeners greater tolerance to positive than negative mistuning of the higher tone within an octave pair. It hypothesizes a neural circuit tuned to cancel the lower tone, that also cancels the higher tone if that tone is in tune. Imperfect cancellation is the cue to mistuning of the octave. The circuit involves two neural pathways, one delayed with respect to the other, that feed a coincidence-sensitive neuron via excitatory and inhibitory synapses. A mismatch between the time constants of these two synapses results in an asymmetry in sensitivity to mismatch. Specifically, if the time constant of the delayed pathway is greater than that of the direct pathway, there is a greater tolerance to positive mistuning than to negative mistuning. The model is directly applicable to the harmonic octave (concurrent tones), but extending it to the melodic octave (successive tones) requires additional assumptions that are discussed. The paper reviews evidence from auditory psychophysics and physiology in favor - or against - this explanation.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the fitness landscape of protein sequences has historically relied on training models on family-specific sets of homologous sequences called Multiple Sequence Alignments. Many proteins are however difficult to align or have shallow alignments which limits the potential scope of alignment-based methods. Not subject to these limitations, large protein language models trained on non-aligned sequences across protein families have achieved increasingly high predictive performance - but have not yet fully bridged the gap with their alignment-based counterparts. In this work, we introduce TranceptEVE - a hybrid method between family-specific and family-agnostic models that seeks to build on the relative strengths from each approach. Our method gracefully adapts to the depth of the alignment, fully relying on its autoregressive transformer when dealing with shallow alignments and leaning more heavily on the family-specific models for proteins with deeper alignments. Besides its broader application scope, it achieves state-of-the-art performance for mutation effects prediction, both in terms of correlation with experimental assays and with clinical annotations from ClinVar.",

    "abstract": "Chemical sensing via olfaction constitutes a most ancient form of inter-organism communication. But acoustical signaling via tonal and rhythmic patterning is also common among higher vertebrates. Animals that live in well ventilated habitats and move in diasporic ways have further evolved more spectrally varied and discretized call structure. But unlike song in birds, researchers have struggled to locate isolated nucleii specialized for music cognition. The brain stem, midbrain, hindbrain, and forebrain, however, all largely associate with aspects of musical performance, perception, memory, and emotion. I hypothesized that spectral features of musical display evolved as honest signals of spatial cognition for precarious locomotor tasks associated with nurturing and protecting vulnerable offspring. I investigated possible connections between motor, visual, and spatial cognitive areas in relation to both signaler production and receiver processing of acoustical features of musical output. Brain component volume fractions of 42 parts from 48 primates were compiled, from a single source, and compared against a vocal complexity index (ARDI) as well as individual musical feature scores: including tone, interval, repetition, transposition rhythm, and unique syllable count. Structures for spatial and visual perception as well as motor control and emotional processing associated moderately with areas used by species who produce calls with both temporal and spectral musical features. These findings are consistent with a dual (both receiver- and signaler-side) function of musical signals. Associations with spatio-social areas (e.g. schizocortex and insula) support direct selection for a paralimbic-based neighbor orienting [PIANO] sensory modality for mapping and anticipating movement of fellow arboreal cohabitants. Associations with motor areas (e.g. LGN, mid-brain, and thalamus) support the complementary model that signaler capacities for spatio-motive emplacement [ME] are indirectly selected by conspecific receivers. This dual manifestation in low-parity species that locomote in diasporic ways through (arboreally) diffuse habitats, is compatible with musicality serving as courtship signals by long-term mates with consistent and reliable spatial capacities directly relevant to care of vulnerable (arboreal) offspring.",

    "abstract": "Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has been endemic in Sudan for decades and causes continuous outbreaks that have a direct negative impact on the animal population and prevent the exportation of animals from the country. The high diversity of FMD serotypes, especially SAT2 and A serotypes, hinders the development of effective vaccines since the most important component of vaccination is the degree of cross-protection provided by the vaccine against currently circulating field viruses. An immunoinformatic approach was utilized to predict a multi-epitope peptide vaccine design against the SAT2 serotype from a Sudanese isolate targeting virus capsid region P1. The virus capsid region P1 comprises the major immunogenic epitopes that confer protection against the FMD virus. Two predicted T-cell epitopes were identified that showed high binding affinity with MHC1 alleles (VQRSRQSTL and YHAEWDTGL) and high conservation with SAT2 African serotypes and were located within the VP1 and VP3 proteins, respectively. Only one epitope was predicted for B cells (LPATPEDAAH), which scored above the threshold in Bepipred linear epitope, Emini surface accessibility, and Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity and is located in VP3 protein. Molecular docking of the peptides (VQRSRQSTL and YHAEWDTGL) with the MHC1 allele showed satisfactory interaction with the binding sites of BoLA-HD6 using UCSF chimera 1.13.1 software. The peptide VQRSRQSTL showed remarkable hydrophobic interaction with the BoLA-HD6 allele, which was superior to the other peptides. This study is the first to propose a peptide vaccine against FMD SAT2 serotypes from a Sudanese isolate.",

However, few studies have used the genetic diversity in mosquito infections to understand how transmission is sustained. We identified likely human sources of mosquito infections from a longitudinal cohort in Western Kenya based on genetic similarity between parasites and the timing of infections. We found that several human infections were required to reconstitute each mosquito infection and that multiple parasite clones were likely transmitted from infected humans to mosquitoes in each bite, suggesting that superinfection and co-transmission occur simultaneously and are important mechanisms of transmission. We further investigated this using an individual human and mosquito simulation model and found that co-transmission alone was unlikely to reproduce the high complexity of mosquito infections. We concluded that the superinfection of mosquitoes likely plays an important, but under studied, role in sustaining moderate to high malaria transmission.",

Purified spike-EABR eVLPs presented densely-arrayed spikes and elicited potent antibody responses in mice. Two immunizations with mRNA-LNP encoding spike-EABR elicited potent CD8+ T-cell responses and superior neutralizing antibody responses against original and variant SARS-CoV-2 compared to conventional spike-encoding mRNA-LNP and purified spike-EABR eVLPs, improving neutralizing titers >10-fold against Omicron-based variants for three months post-boost. Thus, EABR technology enhances potency and breadth of vaccine-induced responses through antigen presentation on cell surfaces and eVLPs, enabling longer-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.",

Camelid nanobodies are attractive therapeutic candidates due to their high stability, ease of large-scale production and potential for delivery via inhalation. Here, we characterize the RBD-specific nanobody W25, which we previously isolated from an alpaca, and show superior neutralization activity towards Omicron lineage BA.1 in comparison to all other SARS-CoV2 variants. Structure analysis of W25 in complex with the SARS-CoV2 spike surface glycoprotein shows that W25 engages an RBD epitope not covered by any of the antibodies previously approved for emergency use. Furthermore, we show that W25 also binds the spike protein from the emerging, more infectious Omicron BA.2 lineage with picomolar affinity. In vivo evaluation of W25 prophylactic and therapeutic treatments across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant infection models, together with W25 biodistribution analysis in mice, demonstrates favorable pre-clinical properties. Together, these data endorse prioritization of W25 for further clinical development.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, capable of escaping the humoral immunity acquired by the available vaccines, together with waning immunity and vaccine hesitancy, challenges the efficacy of the vaccination strategy in fighting COVID-19. Improved therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed to better intervene particularly in severe cases of the disease. They should aim at controlling the hyper-inflammatory state generated upon infection, at reducing lung tissue pathology and endothelial damages, along with viral replication. Previous research has pointed a possible role for the chaperone HSP90 in SARS-CoV-2 replication and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Pharmacological intervention through HSP90 inhibitors was shown to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, infections and reducing replication of diverse viruses. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the potent HSP90 inhibitor Ganetespib in vitro on alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to characterize its effects on cell activation and viral replication. Additionally, to evaluate its efficacy in controlling systemic inflammation and the viral burden after infection in vivo, a Syrian hamster model was used. In vitro, Ganetespib reduced viral replication on AECs in a dose-dependent manner and lowered significantly the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, in both AECs and alveolar macrophages. In vivo, administration of Ganetespib led to an overall improvement of the clinical condition of infected animals, with decreased systemic inflammation, reduced edema formation and lung tissue pathology. Altogether, we show that Ganetespib could be a potential medicine to treat moderate and severe cases of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "In late 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants have highly diversified, and XBB is spreading rapidly around the world. Our phylogenetic analyses suggested that XBB emerged by recombination of two co-circulating BA.2 lineages, BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1 (a progeny of BA.2.75), during the summer of 2022 around India. In vitro experiments revealed that XBB is the most profoundly resistant variant to BA.2/5 breakthrough infection sera ever and is more fusogenic than BA.2.75. Notably, the recombination breakpoint is located in the receptor-binding domain of spike, and each region of recombined spike conferred immune evasion and augmented fusogenicity to the XBB spike. Finally, the intrinsic pathogenicity of XBB in hamsters is comparable to or even lower than that of BA.2.75. Our multiscale investigation provided evidence suggesting that XBB is the first documented SARS-CoV-2 variant increasing its fitness through recombination rather than single mutations.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox is a viral zoonosis with symptoms that are reminiscent to those experienced in previous smallpox cases. GSAID databases (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) was used to assess 630 genomes of MPXV. Six primary clades were inferred from the phylogenetic study, coupled with a lesser percentage in radiating clades. Individual clades that make up various nationalities may have formed as a result of a particular SNP hotspot type, which may have mutated in a particular population type.\n\nThe most significant mutation, based on a mutational hotspot analysis, was found at G3729A and G5143A. The gene ORF138, which encodes the Ankyrin repeat (ANK) protein, was found to have the most mutations. This protein is known to mediate molecular recognition via protein-protein interactions. It was shown that 243 host proteins interacted with 10 monkeypox proteins identified as the hub proteins E3, SPI2, C5, K7, E8, G6, N2, B14, CRMB, and A41 through 262 direct connections. The interaction with chemokine system-related proteins provides further evidence that the human protein is being suppressed by the monkey pox virus in order to facilitate its survival against innate immunity.\n\nA few FDA-approved molecules were likely used as possible inhibitors after being researched for blocking F13, a significant envelope protein on the membrane of extracellular versions of virus. A total of 2500 putative ligands were docked individually with the F13 protein. The F13 protein and these molecules interaction may help prevent the monkey pox virus from spreading. As a result, after being confirmed by experiments, these putative inhibitors might have an impact on the activity of these proteins and be utilised in monkeypox treatments.",

Phylogenetic relationships of ancestry revealed the absence of genetically distinct subgroups, which was corroborated by the low value of FST found (15.38%). The low degree of polymorphism found among these samples, corroborated by the almost non-existent genetic distance, helped or established the absence of a genetic structuring pattern, demonstrating a satisfactory pattern of response to vaccines, since all the sequences analyzed were part of the Brazilian strains of variant B.1.1 of SARS-CoV-2 used in vaccines.",

    "abstract": "With machine learning now transforming the sciences, successful prediction of biological structure or activity is mainly limited by the extent and quality of data available for training, the astute choice of features for prediction, and thorough assessment of the robustness of prediction on a variety of new cases. Here we address these issues while developing and sharing protocols to build a robust dataset and rigorously compare several predictive classifiers using the opensource Python machine learning library, scikit-learn. We show how to evaluate whether enough data has been used for training and whether the classifier has been overfit to training data. The most telling experiment is 500-fold repartitioning of the training and test sets, followed by prediction, which gives a good indication of whether a classifier performs consistently well on different datasets. An intuitive method is used to quantify which features are most important for correct prediction.\n\nThe resulting well-trained classifier, hotspotter, can robustly predict the small subset of amino acid residues on the surface of a protein that are energetically most important for binding a protein partner: the interaction hot spots. Hotspotter has been trained and tested here on a curated dataset assembled from 1,046 non-redundant alanine scanning mutation sites with experimentally measured change in binding free energy values from 97 different protein complexes; this dataset is available to download. The accessible surface area of the wild-type residue at a given site and its degree of evolutionary conservation proved the most important features to identify hot spots. A variant classifier was trained and validated for proteins where only the amino acid sequence is available, augmented by secondary structure assignment. This version of hotspotter requiring fewer features is almost as robust as the structure-based classifier. Application to the ACE2 receptor, which mediates COVID-19 virus entry into human cells, identified the critical hot spot triad of ACE2 residues at the center of the small interface with the CoV-2 spike protein. Hotspotter results can be used to guide the strategic design of protein interfaces and ligands and also to identify likely interfacial residues for protein:protein docking.",

Respiratory reductases play important roles in multiple geochemical cycles but their significance in other contexts remains unclear. Here we identify three taxonomically distinct families of gut bacteria that encode exceptionally large arsenals of tens to hundreds of respiratory-like reductases per genome. By screening representative species from each family, we discover 22 metabolites used as respiratory electron acceptors in a species-specific manner. Identified respiratory reactions transform multiple classes of dietary- and host-derived fecal metabolites, including bioactive molecules like resveratrol and the immunometabolite itaconate. Reductase substrate-profiling identifies enzyme-substrate pairs and paints a striking picture of reductase evolution, including evidence that reductases with specificities for related cinnamate substrates but distinct mechanisms independently emerged at least four separate times.

    "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) infection induces the formation of membrane-less, cytoplasmic compartments termed viral factories, in which multiple viral proteins gather and coordinate viral transcription, replication and assembly. Key to viral factory function is the recruitment of EBOV polymerase, a multifunctional machine that mediates transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome. We show that intracellularly reconstituted EBOV viral factories are biomolecular condensates, with composition-dependent internal exchange dynamics that likely facilitates viral replication. Within the viral factory, we found the EBOV polymerase clusters into foci. The distance between these foci increases when viral replication is enabled. In addition to the typical droplet-like viral factories, we report the formation of network-like viral factories during EBOV infection. Unlike droplet-like viral factories, network-like factories are inactive for EBOV nucleocapsid assembly. This unique view of EBOV propagation suggests a form-to-function relationship that describes how physical properties and internal structures of biomolecular condensates influence viral biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "KSHV utilizes distinct origins of DNA replication (origin of replications) during the latent and lytic phases of its life cycle. Lytic DNA replication requires the participation of cellular and viral proteins to initiate replication at a specific region in the KSHV genome, oriLyt. These regions contain multiple secondary structures and binding sites for the viral and cellular proteins. We discovered the presence of G-quadruplex (G4s) sites in the oriLyt region. G-quadruplexes are secondary structures in nucleic acid sequences that are considered regulators of multiple biological processes, such as transcription, translation, and replication initiation. Importantly, herpesviruses have a high density of PQS (putative quadruplex formation sites) in their genome, including in the regulatory regions, which control replication and transcription. The binding of RecQ1 to the oriLyt region of KSHV and its ability to unwind the G4 structures led us to speculate that G-quadruplex sites play an important role in lytic DNA replication. In this study, we confirmed the formation of stable G-quadruplexes through biochemical and biophysical assays. We further demonstrated that RecQ1 associates with the G4 sites of the oriLyt. The functional significance of RecQ1-mediated unwinding of G4 sites was confirmed by the inhibition and depletion of RecQ1 activity and protein levels through a pharmacologic inhibitor and short-hairpin, respectively. Furthermore, the detection of replication initiation through single-molecule analysis of the replicated DNA (SMARD) approach demonstrated that G4 stabilization leads to a subdued initiation of replication at the oriLyt. This confirmed the role of the G-quadruplex in regulating viral DNA replication, which can be used for controlling virus growth.\n\nSignificanceBiological processes originating from the DNA and RNA can be regulated by the secondary structures present in the stretch of nucleic acids, and the G-quadruplexes are shown to regulate transcription, translation, and replication. In this study, we identified the presence of multiple G-quadruplex sites in the region (oriLyt) of KSHV DNA, which is essential for the replication of DNA during the lytic cycle. We demonstrated the roles of these G-quadruplexes through multiple biochemical and biophysical assays in controlling replication and efficient virus production. We demonstrated that KSHV achieves this by recruiting RecQ1 (helicase) at these G-quadruplex sites for efficient viral DNA replication. Analysis of the replicated DNA through nucleoside labeling and immunostaining showed a reduced initiation of DNA replication in cells with a pharmacologic stabilizer of G-quadruplexes. Overall, this study confirmed the role of the G-quadruplex in regulating viral DNA replication, which can be exploited for controlling viral DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Obligate intracellular bacteria of the order Rickettsiales include numerous arthropod-borne human pathogens. However, our understanding of the basic biology of Rickettsia species is limited by technical challenges imposed by their obligate intracellular lifestyle. To overcome this roadblock, we developed quantitative methods to assess the cell wall composition, intracellular growth, and morphology of Rickettsia parkeri, a human pathogen in the Spotted Fever Group of the Rickettsia genus. Analysis of the cell wall composition of R. parkeri revealed unique features including a high M3 monomer fraction and absence of LD-crosslinks. Using a novel fluorescence microscopy approach, we quantified the cell morphology of R. parkeri in live host cells and found that bacterial morphology is maintained stably during exponential growth in two different epithelial cell lines. To assess population growth kinetics in a high-throughput and high-resolution manner, we developed an imaging-based growth assay and applied this to determine the growth rate of up to 24 infected cultures at a time. We also sought to gain insight into the cell cycle regulation of R. parkeri. To this end, we developed methods to quantify the fraction of the population preparing to divide as well as those undergoing active constriction. These approaches permitted a quantitative analysis of cell cycle status across a population of R. parkeri. Finally, as a proof of concept, we applied the above tools to quantitatively determine how MreB, a bacterial actin homolog, contributes to the growth and morphogenesis of R. parkeri. Inhibition of MreB with the small molecule MP265 led to cell rounding and slowed growth, suggesting that MreB is required for the growth and shape maintenance of R. parkeri. Collectively, we developed a toolkit of high-throughput, quantitative tools to understand intracellular growth and morphogenesis of R. parkeri that is translatable to other obligate intracellular bacteria.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe obligate intracellular lifestyle of members of the bacterial order Rickettsiales, which includes important human pathogens, has hindered our progress in understanding their biology. Here we developed and applied high-throughput, quantitative tools to analyze essential features of rickettsial cell biology such as morphology and growth in living host cells. By applying these tools in a proof of concept, we showed that the bacterial actin homolog, MreB is required for the regulation of rod shape and intracytoplasmic growth.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a neglected zoonotic pathogen that caused a worldwide outbreak in May 2022. Given the lack of an established therapy, the development of an anti-MPXV strategy is of vital importance. To identify drug targets for the development of anti-MPXV agents, we screened a chemical library using an MPXV infection cell assay and found that gemcitabine, trifluridine, and mycophenolic acid (MPA) inhibited MPXV propagation. These compounds showed broad-spectrum anti-orthopoxvirus activities and presented lower 90% inhibitory concentrations (0.032-1.40 M) than brincidofovir, an approved anti-smallpox agent. These three compounds have been suggested to target the post-entry step to reduce the intracellular production of virions. Knockdown of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of guanosine biosynthesis and a target of MPA, dramatically reduced MPXV DNA production. Moreover, supplementation with guanosine recovered the anti-MPXV effect of MPA, suggesting that IMPDH and its guanosine biosynthetic pathway regulate MPXV replication. By targeting IMPDH, we identified a series of compounds with stronger anti-MPXV activity than MPA. These evidences propose that IMPDH is a potential target for the development of anti-MPXV agents.\n\nImportanceMonkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus, and a worldwide outbreak occurred in May 2022. The smallpox vaccine has recently been approved for clinical use against monkeypox in the United States. Although brincidofovir and tecovirimat are drugs approved for the treatment of smallpox by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, their efficacy against monkeypox has not been established. Moreover, these drugs may present negative side effects. Therefore, new anti-monkeypox virus agents are needed. This study revealed that gemcitabine, trifluridine, and mycophenolic acid inhibited monkeypox virus propagation, exhibited broad-spectrum anti-orthopoxvirus activities. We also suggested inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase as a potential target for the development of anti-monkeypox virus agents. By targeting this molecule, we identified a series of compounds with stronger anti-monkeypox virus activity than mycophenolic acid.",

However, little is known about the effect of A. apis infestation on the activities of antioxidant enzymes in bee larvae. Here, A. apis spores were purified and used to inoculate Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) larvae, followed by detection of the host survival rate and evaluation of the activities of four major antioxidant enzymes. At 6 days post inoculation (dpi) with A. apis spores, white mycelia penetrated the posterior end of the larva, extended to the anterior end, and eventually covered the entire larval body surface, presenting an obvious symptom of chalkbrood disease similar to that occurs in Apis mellifera larvae. Additionally, PCR identification showed that the expected fragment was amplified from the A. apis-inoculated larval guts and the A. apis spores, verifying the A. apis infection of A. cerana larvae. The survival rate of larvae inoculated with A. apis was high at 1-2 dpi, sharply decreased to 4.16% at 4 dpi, and reached 0% at 5 dpi; whereas that of un-inoculated larvae was always high at 1~8 dpi, with an average survival rate of 95.37%, indicating the negative impact of A. apis infection on larval survival. Furthermore, in comparison with those in the corresponding un-inoculated groups, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in the 4-day-old larval gut in the A. apis-inoculated groups were reduced (p > 0.05), while those in the 5- and 6-day-old larval guts were significantly decreased (p < 0.05); the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in the 4- and 5-day-old larval guts was significantly increased (p < 0.05), while that in the 6-day-old larval gut was reduced (p > 0.05); the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in 4-day-old larval gut was increased (p > 0.05) and that in the 5-day-old larval gut was significantly increased (p < 0.05), whereas that in the 6-day-old larval gut was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). These results together suggested that the activities of SOD and CAT in the larval guts were suppressed during the process of A. apis infestation, while the GST activity was induced to activation, and the PPO activity was first enhanced and then inhibited. Our findings not only unravel the response of A. cerana larvae to A. apis infestation from a biochemical perspective, but also offer a valuable insight into the interaction between Asian honey bee larvae and A. apis.",

In this work, on the basis of our previously obtained high-quality small RNA-seq datasets from western honey bee (Apis mellifera) larval guts, the differential expression profile of piRNAs in A. mellifera larval guts after Ascosphaera apis infestation was analyzed, followed by structural characterization, target prediction, and regulatory network investigation. The potential roles of differentially expressed piRNAs (DEpiRNAs) in regulating host response, especially immune response, were further discussed. In this study, 504, 657, and 587 piRNAs were respectively identified in the 4-, 5-, and 6-day-old larval guts infected by A. apis, with 411 (53.24%) piRNAs shared. The length distribution of these piRNAs ranged from 24 nt to 33 nt and their first base had a \"C\" bias, similar to piRNAs discovered in other mammals and insects. Additionally, 96, 103, and 143 DEpiRNAs were detected in the 4-, 5-, and 6-day-old comparison groups; among these, piR-ame-149736, piR-ame-1066173, and piR-ame-1125190 were the most up-regulated, while piR-ame-1202932 was the most down-regulated. There were 68 DEpiRNAs shared between these three comparison groups. The targets of the DEpiRNAs in the three comparison groups were engaged in a suite of crucial functions associated with biological processes, molecular function, and cellular components, including molecular transducer activity, biological regulation, and membrane part. These targets were also relevant to diverse vital pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, inositol phosphate metabolism, and Wnt signaling pathway. Further investigation demonstrated that targets of DEpiRNAs were involved in three energy metabolism-related pathways, seven development-associated signaling pathways, and seven immune-relevant pathways, including lysosome and endocytosis, as well as the MAPK and Jak-STAT signaling pathways. The expression trends of five randomly selected DEpiRNAs were verified using a combination of RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. Moreover, the expression levels of six genes targeted by piR-ame-945760 were detected by RT-qPCR, with the results showing that their expression trends were the same as the expression trend of piR-ame-945760, indicative of the positive correlation between piR-ame-945760 and these targets. These results suggest that A.apis infestation increased the overall expression level of piRNAs and altered the expression pattern of piRNAs in A. mellifera larval guts. DEpiRNAs potentially participate in the A. apis response of the host by modulating the expression of target genes associated with energy metabolism and development, as well as cellular and humoral immune response. Our findings not only offer novel insights into A. mellifera larva-A. apis interaction, but also lay the groundwork for clarifying the mechanisms underlying DEpiRNA-regulated larval response.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-like protein, ISG15, can act as a cytokine or can covalently modify host and pathogen-derived proteins. The consequences of ISG15 modification on substrate fate remain unknown. Here we reveal that ISGylation of the Arp2/3 complex slows actin filament formation and stabilizes Arp2/3 dependent structures including cortical actin and lamella. When properly controlled, this serves as an antibacterial and antiviral host defense strategy to directly restrict actin-mediated pathogen spread. However, Listeria monocytogenes takes advantage in models of dysregulated ISGylation, leading to increased mortality due to augmented spread. The underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the ISG15-dependent impact on actin-based motility is due to failed bacterial separation after division. This promotes spread by enabling the formation of multi-headed bacterial \"bazookas\" with stabilized comet tails that can disseminate deeper into tissues. A bacterial mutant that cannot recruit Arp2/3 or a non-ISGylatable mutant of Arp3 is sufficient to rescue slowed comet tail speed and restrict spread. Importantly, ISG15-deficient neonatal mice have aberrant epidermal epithelia characterized by keratinocytes with diffuse cortical actin, which could underlie observed defects in wound healing in human patients who lack ISG15. Ultimately, our discovery links host innate immune responses to cytoskeletal dynamics with therapeutic implications for viral infection and metastasis.",

In this paper, we challenge this view and provide evidence that many dung beetle communities are actually associated with the dung of reptiles and birds (= Sauropsida). In turn, this indicates that sauropsid dung may have played a crucial evolutionary role that was previously underestimated. We argue that it is physiologically realistic to consider that coprophagy in dung beetles could have evolved during the Cretaceous in response to the massive amount of dung produced by dinosaurs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sauropsid dung may be one of the major factors driving the emergence of insular dung beetle communities across the globe. We support our findings with amplicon-metagenomic analyses, trapping experiments, and meta-analysis of the published literature.",

    "abstract": "Phages are known for their genetic modularity. Their genomes are built of independent functional modules that evolve separately and combine in various ways, making them astoundingly diverse. Multiple studies have demonstrated how genome mosaicism emerges in phage populations and facilitates adaptation to their hosts, bacteria. However, less is known about the extent of (within-)protein modularity and its impact on viral evolution. To fill this knowledge gap, here we quantified such modularity by detecting instances of protein mosaicism, defined as a homologous fragment between two otherwise unrelated proteins. We used highly sensitive homology detection to quantify protein mosaicism between pairs of 133,574 representative phage proteins and to understand its relationship with functional diversity in phage genomes. We found that diverse functional classes often shared homologous domains. This phenomenon was often linked to protein modularity, particularly in receptor-binding proteins, endolysins and DNA polymerases. We also identified multiple instances of recent diversification via exchange and gain/loss of domains in receptor-binding proteins, neck passage structures, endolysins and some members of the core replication machinery. We argue that the ongoing diversification via shuffling of protein domains associated with those functions is reflective of co-evolutionary arms race and the resulting diversifying selection to overcome multiple bacterial resistance mechanisms.",

With NHS esters both amide- and ester cross-links can be formed. Retention time prediction for strong cation exchange chromatography (SCXC) of cross-linked peptides at pH 3 can distinguish between ester and amide cross-links based on their charge differences. By this approach we show that about 98 % of cross-links are formed by two amide bonds. However MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of an ester linkage in more than 5% of peptide pairs predicted by SCXC to be linked by amide bonds. This discrepancy can be explained by intra-peptide amide-ester rearrangement in the gas phase during MS/MS analysis. So, SCXC retention time prediction can be used to distinguish amide-amide, amide-ester and ester-ester linkages actually formed in the cross-linking reaction and to detect scrambling of cross-linked sites. This information is important for studies aimed to understand the spatial arrangement of protein complexes by cross-linking at the highest possible resolution.",

    "abstract": "The architecture and folding of complex RNAs is governed by a limited set of highly recurrent structural motifs that form long-range tertiary interactions. One of these motifs is the T-loop, which was first identified in tRNA but is broadly distributed across biological RNAs. While the T-loop has been examined in detail in different biological contexts, the various receptors that it interacts with are not as well defined. In this study, we use a cell-based genetic screen in concert with bioinformatic analysis to examine three different, but related, T-loop receptor motifs found in the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and cobalamin (Cbl) riboswitches. As a host for different T-loop receptors, we employed the env8 class-II Cbl riboswitch, an RNA that uses two T-loop motifs for both folding and supporting the ligand binding pocket. A set of libraries was created in which select nucleotides that participate in the T-loop/T-loop receptor (TL/TLR) interaction were fully randomized. Library members were screened for their ability to support Cbl-dependent expression of a reporter gene. While T-loops appear to be variable in sequence, we find that the functional sequence space is more restricted in the Cbl riboswitch, suggesting that TL/TLR interactions are context dependent. Our data reveal clear sequence signatures for the different types of receptor motifs that align with phylogenic analysis of these motifs in the FMN and Cbl riboswitches. Finally, our data suggest the functional contribution of various nucleobase-mediated long-range interactions within the riboswitch subclass of TL/TLR interactions that are distinct from those found in other RNAs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe T-loop motif frequently mediates tertiary interactions in RNA\nC_LIO_LIActivity-based screen used to explore T-loop mediate interactions in riboswitches\nC_LIO_LIResults from the screen were consistent with phylogenetic analysis\nC_LIO_LIT-loop/T-loop recepto{-}{-}{-}{-}r interactions are context dependent\nC_LI",

PRC1 proteins phase separate to form Polycomb condensates (bodies) that are multi-component hubs for silencing Polycomb target genes; however, the molecular principles that underpin the condensate assembly and biophysical properties remain unknown. Here, by using biochemical reconstitution, cellular imaging, and multiscale molecular simulations, we show that PRC1 condensates are assembled via a scaffold-client liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) model by which Chromobox 2 (CBX2) is the scaffold and other subunits of the CBX2-PRC1 complex act as clients. The clients induce a reentrant phase transition of CBX2 condensates in a concentration-dependent manner. The composition of the multi-component, heterotypic LLPS systems directs the assembly and biophysical properties of CBX2-PRC1 condensates and selectively promotes the formation of CBX4-PRC1 condensates, but specifically dissolves condensates of CBX6-, CBX7-, and CBX8-PRC1. Additionally, the composition of CBX2-PRC1 condensates controls the enrichment of CBX4-, CBX7-, and CBX8-PRC1 into condensates but the exclusion of CBX6-PRC1 from condensates. Our results show the composition- and stoichiometry-dependent scaffold-client assembly of multi-component PRC1 condensates and supply a conceptual framework underlying the molecular basis and dynamics of Polycomb condensate assembly.",

Recent studies indicate that biasing NTSR1 toward {beta}-Arrestin signaling can attenuate the actions of psychostimulants and other drugs of abuse. Here we provide the cryoEM structures of NTSR1 ternary complexes with heterotrimeric Gq and Go with and without the brain penetrant small molecule SBI-553. In functional studies, we discovered that SBI-553 displays complex allosteric actions exemplified by negative allosteric modulation for G proteins that are G subunit selective and positive allosteric modulation and agonism for {beta}-Arrestin translocation at NTSR1. Detailed structural analysis of the allosteric binding site illuminated the structural determinants for biased allosteric modulation of SBI-553 on NTSR1. These insights promise to both accelerate the structure-guided design of more effective NTSR1 therapeutics and provide insights into the complexities of GPCR allosteric modulation.",

Combining immunolocalization, pH-dependent fluorescent quenching, and topology prediction programs, we mapped the membrane topology of PIN5 and PIN8 in Arabidopsis thaliana root cells. Our results indicate that, except for the similarities in the orientation of the N-terminus, PIN5 and PIN8 have an opposite orientation of the central hydrophilic loop and the C-terminus, as well as an unequal number of transmembrane domains (TMDs). PIN8 has ten TMDs with groups of five alpha-helices separated by the central hydrophilic loop (HL) residing in the ER lumen, and its N- and C-terminals are positioned in the cytoplasm. However, topology of PIN5 comprises nine TMDs. Its N-terminal end and the central HL face the cytoplasm while its C-terminus resides in the ER lumen. Overall, the divergent membrane topology of PIN5 and PIN8 provides a possible explanation for the mutually opposing activity of these intracellular auxin homeostasis regulators.",

Generated abstracts had a similar patient cohort size as original abstracts, though the exact numbers were fabricated. When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, but that the generated abstracts were vaguer and had a formulaic feel to the writing.\n\nConclusionChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. These are original without any plagiarism detected but are often identifiable using an AI output detector and skeptical human reviewers. Abstract evaluation for journals and medical conferences must adapt policy and practice to maintain rigorous scientific standards; we suggest inclusion of AI output detectors in the editorial process and clear disclosure if these technologies are used. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing remain to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that is rapidly growing in popularity for studying causal brain-behavior relationships. However, its dose-dependent direct neural mechanisms, i.e., due to electric field or connectivity, and peripheral sensory co-stimulation effects remain debated. Understanding how TMS stimulation parameters affect brain responses is vital for the rational design of TMS protocols. Studying these mechanisms in humans is challenging due to the limited spatiotemporal resolution of available non-invasive neuroimaging methods. Here, we leverage invasive recordings of local field potentials in non-human primates to study TMS mesoscale responses. We demonstrate that early TMS-evoked potentials show a sigmoidal dose-response with stimulation intensity. We further show that stimulation responses are spatially specific. We employ several control conditions to dissociate direct neural responses from auditory and somatosensory co-activation. These results provide crucial evidence regarding TMS neural effects at the brain circuit level. Our findings are highly relevant for interpreting human TMS studies and biomarker developments for TMS target engagement in clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Sensory feedback is critical for effectively controlling brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and neuroprosthetic devices. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is proposed as a technique to induce artificial sensory perceptions in rodents, monkeys, and humans. However, to realize the full potential of SCS as a sensory neuroprosthetic technology, a better understanding of the effect of SCS pulse train parameter changes on sensory detection and discrimination thresholds is necessary. Here we investigated whether stimulation periodicity impacts rats ability to detect and discriminate SCS-induced perceptions at different frequencies. By varying the coefficient of variation (CV) of interstimulus pulse interval, we showed that at lower frequencies, rats could detect highly aperiodic SCS pulse trains at lower amplitudes (i.e., decreased detection thresholds). Furthermore, rats learned to discriminate stimuli with subtle differences in periodicity, and the just-noticeable differences (JNDs) from a highly aperiodic stimulus were smaller than those from a periodic stimulus. These results demonstrate that the temporal structure of an SCS pulse train is an integral parameter for modulating sensory feedback in neuroprosthetic applications.",

    "abstract": "An open discussion in studies of intrinsic brain functional connectivity is the mitigation of head motion-related artifacts, particularly in the presence of peculiar symptomatology such as in Parkinsons disease (PD). Previous studies show that Independent Component Analysis (ICA) denoising improves the reproducibility of functional connectivity findings by detecting sources of non-neural signals. However, there is still no consensus about which pre-processing pipeline should be applied in natural high motion populations such as PD, particularly in relation to novel functional network descriptions derived from dynamic connectivity analyses. In this study, we investigated how different pre-processing pipelines affect intrinsic brain connectivity metrics, both static and dynamic, derived from a group of young healthy controls (HC) and a group of PD participants.\n\nA total of 20 HC and 20 PD subjects participated in this 3 T MRI study. Resting-state functional MRI images were used to test the effects of the pre-processing pipeline of static (sFC) and temporal-varying functional connectivity (dFC) estimations. Both MRI datasets were pre-processed using three different workflows differing in the motion correction approach: (i) standard motion realignment (mc); (ii) motion outlier detection and deweighting based on image intensity change estimations (DVARS) and (iii) ICA-based noise removal using reference noise features (AROMA). Furthermore, the PD dataset was also processed with a fourth method by applying an ICA-based denoising (FIX), previously trained on the HC group. sFC analysis was performed using Group ICA, by temporally concatenating different pre-processing types in pairs of different runs. Two types of dFC analyses were considered: innovation-driven co-activation patterns (iCAPs) and co-activation patterns (CAPs). CAPs allow dFC estimations that do not require the deconvolution of the hemodynamic response function and its derivative, thus potentially being less sensitive to head-motion related noise. We found that regardless of substantial head motion differences in the two groups, sFC results were consistent across denoising strategies. Conversely, dFC was extremely sensitive to denoising strategies, particularly for the PD group with the transient-based dFC analyses. Indeed, the use of the peak-based dFC framework enables the detection of time-varying networks but in a way that is highly dependent on the motion correction pipeline. In conclusion, we show that dynamic functional network representations are highly sensitive to both head motion and to fMRI denoising methods. These findings stress the importance of considering and reporting these experimental aspects to help with the reproducibility and interpretation of different studies. Future work is needed to further investigate transient-based dFC strategies that are more robust to head motion.",

Accordingly, HP1{gamma} gene inactivation in the mouse gut epithelium resulted in an immunopathology with a long-lasting up-regulation of STAT1 and PD-L1. Colon organoids models and in vitro cell lines showed that HP1{gamma} deficiency primed STAT1 and PD-L1 expressions, ultimately sensitizing epithelial cells to IFN-{gamma} stimulation.

    "abstract": "Mammalian sperm exhibit an unusual and heavily-compacted genomic packaging state. In addition to its role in organizing the compact and hydrodynamic sperm head, it has been proposed that sperm chromatin architecture helps to program gene expression in the early embryo. Scores of genome-wide surveys in sperm have reported patterns of chromatin accessibility, histone localization, histone modification, and chromosome folding. Here, we revisit these studies in light of recent reports that sperm obtained from the mouse epididymis are contaminated with low levels of cell-free chromatin. In the absence of proper sperm lysis we readily recapitulate multiple prominent genome-wide surveys of sperm chromatin, suggesting that these profiles primarily reflect contaminating cell-free chromatin. Removal of cell-free DNA, along with appropriate lysis conditions, are required to reveal a sperm chromatin state distinct from most previous reports. Using ATAC-Seq to explore relatively accessible genomic loci, we identify a landscape of open loci associated with early development and transcriptional control. Histone modification and chromosome folding studies also strongly support the hypothesis that prior studies suffer from contamination, but technical challenges associated with reliably preserving the architecture of the compacted sperm head prevent us from confidently assaying true localization patterns for these epigenetic marks. Together, our studies strongly argue that our knowledge of mammalian chromosome packaging remains largely incomplete, and motivate future efforts to more accurately characterize genome organization in mature sperm.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the major contributors to cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have become the preferred treatment for patients with CKD. However, the renoprotective effects of the combined therapy of the two drugs on hypertensive renal fibrosis are still largely understood. The aim of this study was to compare the antifibrotic effects of canagliflozin, with or without irbesartan, in the kidneys of Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl SS) rats on a high salt (HS) diet. After the preconditioning stage, Dahl SS rats (n = 47) were divided into 5 experimental groups as follows: low salt control (n=7), HS control (n=10), high salt with canagliflozin (n=10), high salt with irbesartan (n=10), and high salt with canagliflozin plus irbesartan (n=10). Mean food and water intake, body weight (BW), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured during the whole experimental period. After 12 weeks, the rats were euthanized, and the kidneys were excised for histomorphometric evaluation and immunohistochemical evaluation. An HS diet increased SBP, renal fibrosis, expression of fibrotic protein factors, and TGF-{beta}/Smad2/3 pathway compared to the LS group. We found that irbesartan reduced SBP and slowed the loss of renal function. Canagliflozin significantly reduced BW and renal fibrosis and downregulated the TGF-{beta}/Smad2/3 pathway. The combined therapy showed better renoprotection in all outcome parameters. In conclusion, these results indicate that canagliflozin and irbesartan exert different benefits on nephroprotection in salt-sensitive hypertensive rats.",

    "abstract": "Image-based machine learning methods are quickly becoming among the most widely-used forms of data analysis across science, technology, and engineering. These methods are powerful because they can rapidly and automatically extract rich contextual and spatial information from images, a process that has historically required a large amount of manual labor. The potential of image-based machine learning methods to change how researchers study the ocean has been demonstrated through a diverse range of recent applications. However, despite their promise, machine learning tools are still under-exploited in many domains including species and environmental monitoring, biodiversity surveys, fisheries abundance and size estimation, rare event and species detection, the study of wild animal behavior, and citizen science. Our objective in this article is to provide an approachable, application-oriented guide to help researchers apply image-based machine learning methods effectively to their own research problems. Using a case study, we describe how to prepare data, train and deploy models, and avoid common pitfalls that can cause models to underperform. Importantly, we discuss how to diagnose problems that can cause poor model performance on new imagery to build robust tools that can vastly accelerate data acquisition in the marine realm.

    "abstract": "Many large pelagic predators, including shark, tuna, and billfish, periodically dive to deep oceanic layers, connecting the surface and mesopelagic ecosystems. However, the patterns and drivers of deep dives across species remain poorly understood. To close this gap, we conduct a meta-analysis of the diving behavior of 24 pelagic predator species from the global ocean, resulting in 671 independent diving depth estimates from 87 tagging studies. Our analysis reveals consistent large-scale patterns in diving depths, with predators diving deeper offshore and during the day, and shallower closer to the coast and during the night. Deep diving species show similar diving depths during the night, with deeper dives for sharks, and shallower dives for tuna and swordfish. These patterns are reversed during the day, widening the gap between day and night vertical ranges for these groups. In contrast, shallow diving species show smaller variations between day and night dives, with sharks diving slightly deeper on average, followed by tuna and billfish. Correlations with co-located environmental variables suggest an important predictive role for proxies of prey abundance and light availability, as well as variables that influence physiology, such as oxygen and temperature. These relationships are more robust for deep divers during the day, and shallow divers at night. Our analysis highlights the value of tagging observations for the development of a mechanistic, quantitative characterization of vertical habitat use of large marine predators and its environmental constraints.",

    "abstract": "Despite its importance in ecological studies and pest controls, the lack of knowledge of the life cycle and the ambiguity of data challenge the accurate determination of insect nymphs regarding many insect species. Finite mixture models are often utilized to classify instars without knowing the instar number. This study derives parsimonious gaussian mixture models using parameter constraints motivated by Dyars rule. Dyars rule explains the growth pattern of larvae and nymphs of insects by assuming a constant ratio of head capsule width for every two adjacent development stages. Accordingly, every mean value of log-transformed data in each instar stage is considered a linear function, where two Dyar constants are an intercept and a slope for the instar stages, respectively, to infer the instar stage of samples. The common variance for every instar stage regarding log-transformed data can be assumed in a mixture model, as well. If valid, these assumptions will allow an efficient estimation of the model by reducing free parameters. As a result, four model hypotheses are proposed for each assumption of instar counts depending on whether these two parameter constraints are applied. After model estimation, the proposed method uses the ICL criterion to choose the optimal counts of nymphal stages, and parametric bootstrap LR tests are applied to decide the most efficient model regarding parameter constraints. The proposed method could attain the correct model settings during the simulation study. This study also discusses the interpretation of the results of real insect data sets that concord with Dyars rule or not.",

    "abstract": "Cocoa (Theobroma cocoa), which is the key ingredient of chocolate, is an important economic crop plant which supports the livelihoods of an estimated forty to fifty million people directly involved in its cultivation. Many cocoa producing countries, especially those from the developing world, rely on the income from cocoa export to support their economies. The plant is, however, prone to disease and pest attacks and therefore requires the application of large volumes of pesticides to guarantee satisfactory productions. Even though pesticides help protect the cocoa plant from disease and pest attacks, unintended effects of environmental contamination are also a possibility. Honey, a product of nectar collected by honeybees from flowers during foraging, may be a useful proxy for the extent to which landscapes are exposed to pesticides and the degree of pesticide accumulation in the environment. The overreaching question is: to what extent has the effect of pesticides imputed for cocoa production on honey received attention in research? In this present study, we conducted a systematic approach to quantify existing studies on honey contamination from plant protection products approved for cocoa cultivation. We observed that one hundred and sixty-nine different compounds, comprising some recommended and other unapproved compounds for cocoa cultivation, were detected in 81% of the reviewed 104 publications. Our results further point to the neonicotinoids as the most detected class of pesticides, with imidacloprid particularly being the single most detected compound. However, the most remarkable observation made from this study points to disproportionate studies of honey contamination from pesticides conducted in cocoa and non-cocoa producing countries with only 19% of the publications taking place in the latter. To bridge the gap, we suggest prioritising increased research in cocoa growing countries to ameliorate the significant gaps in knowledge owing to limited studies emanating from these geographic regions.",

    "abstract": "In insects, ecological competition has often resulted in phenotypic changes and modifications to foraging areas. In termites - and social insects as a whole - colonies cannot easily escape competition through the relocation of their colony. In these species, the outcomes of inter and intra-specific competition are influenced by different life history traits, such as colony size, breeding system (number and types of reproductives), food preference, tunneling patterns, nest site selection, and antagonism between colonies.\n\nHere, we investigated variation in breeding system and spatial distribution among colonies of a higher termite Amitermes parvulus and a subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes within an urban landscape. We first developed microsatellite markers as a tool to study these life history traits in A. parvulus. Second, we assessed competitive exclusion or tolerance of A. parvulus and R. flavipes colonies by determining their fine-scale distribution using monitoring stations on a grid site, and their large-scale distribution across an urban landscape. Third, we investigated the breeding system of A. parvulus colonies. We showed that the numerous colonies of R. flavipes inhabiting a restricted area contrast with the few, but spatially expansive colonies of A. parvulus, suggesting these species face different degrees of intra-specific competition. We showed that colonies of A. parvulus frequently merged together, and all of them were headed by inbred neotenic reproductives, two characteristics rarely observed in higher termites. Overall, our study revealed drastic differences in colony structure, breeding systems and foraging ranges between the two species. These differences may reflect differences in food preference and food availability between the two species allowing their co-existence within the same urban environment.",

    "abstract": "How steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) orchestrate transcriptional activity remains only partly understood. Upon activation, SHRs bind the genome and recruit their co-regulators, crucial to induce gene expression. However, it remains unknown which components of the SHR-recruited co-regulator complex are essential to drive transcription following hormonal stimuli. Through a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR screen, we comprehensively dissected the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) co-regulatory complex involved in gene-target regulation. We describe a novel functional cross-talk between PAXIP1 and the cohesin subunit STAG2 that is critical for regulation of gene expression by GR. Without altering the GR cistrome, PAXIP1 and STAG2 depletion alter the GR transcriptome, by impairing the recruitment of 3D-genome organization proteins to the GR complex. Importantly, we demonstrate that PAXIP1 is required for stability of cohesin on the genome, its localization to GR-occupied sites, and maintenance of enhancer-promoter interactions. Moreover, in lung cancer, where GR acts as tumor suppressor, PAXIP1/STAG2 loss enhances GR-mediated tumor suppressor activity by modifying local chromatin interactions. All together, we introduce PAXIP1 and STAG2 as novel co-regulators of GR, required to maintain 3D-genome architecture and drive the GR transcriptional programme following hormonal stimuli.",

For this purpose, we collected data from twelve participants, who listened to the words /aba/ or /ada/ embedded in one of three background noises. All noises had the same long-term spectrum but differed in the amount of random envelope fluctuations. The data were analyzed on a trial-by-trial basis using the reverse-correlation method. The results revealed that it is possible to predict the categorical responses with better-than-chance accuracy purely based on the spectro-temporal distribution of the random envelope fluctuations of the corresponding noises, without taking into account the actual targets or the signal-to-noise ratios used in the trials. The effect of the noise fluctuations explained on average 8.1% of the participants responses in white noise, a proportion that increased up to 13.3% for noises with a larger amount of fluctuations. The estimated time-frequency weights revealed that the measured effect originated from confusions between noise fluctuations and relevant acoustic cues from the target words. Substantially similar conclusions were obtained from simulations using an artificial listener. We argue that this token-specific effect of noise is a form of informational masking.",

    "abstract": "Clinical diagnosis of syndromes benefits strongly from objective facial phenotyping. This study investigates facial dysmorphism of genetic syndromes by building and investigating a low-dimensional metric space referred to as the clinical face phenotypic space (CFPS). As a facial matching tool for clinical genetics, such CFPS can enhance clinical diagnosis. It helps to interpret facial dysmorphisms of a subject by placing them within the space of known dysmorphisms. In this paper, a triplet loss-based autoencoder developed by geometric deep learning (GDL) is trained using multi-task learning, which combines supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. Experiments are designed to illustrate the following properties of CFPSs that can aid clinicians in narrowing down their search space: A CFPS can 1) classify and cluster syndromes accurately, 2) generalize to novel syndromes, and 3) preserve the relatedness of genetic diseases, meaning that clusters of phenotypically similar disorders reflect functional relationships between genes. This model is composed of three main components: 1) an encoder based on GDL that optimize distances between individuals in the CFPS therefore adding to the classifiers power. 2) a decoder that improves both classification and clustering performance by reconstructing a face from an embedding in a CFPS, 3) a singular value decomposition layer to maintain orthogonality and optimal variance distribution across dimensions. This allows for the selection of an optimal number of CFPS dimensions as well as improving the classification, reconstruction, and generalization capabilities of the CFPS.",

    "abstract": "The ability to record, stimulate, and modify brains of living animals would unlock numerous research opportunities and create potential clinical interventions, but it is difficult to interface with a living neural network without damaging it. We previously reported a novel approach to building neural interfaces, namely: genetically programming cells to build artificial structures to modify the electrical properties of neurons in situ, which opens up the possibility of modifying neural circuits in living animals without surgery. However, the spatiotemporal resolution, efficiency, and biocompatibility of this approach were still limited and lacked selectivity on cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate an approach using genetically-targeted photosensitizers to instruct living cells to synthesize functional materials directly on the plasma membrane under the control of light. Polymers synthesized by this approach were selectively deposited on the membrane of targeted live neurons. This platform can be readily extended to incorporate a broad range of light-controlled reactions onto specific cells, which may enable researchers to grow seamless, dynamic interfaces directly in living animals.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular paradigm for modeling animal behavior, analyzing neuronal representations, and studying their emergence during learning. This development has been fueled by advances in understanding the role of RL in both the brain and artificial intelligence. However, while in machine learning a set of tools and standardized benchmarks facilitate the development of new methods and their comparison to existing ones, in neuroscience, the software infrastructure is much more fragmented. Even if sharing theoretical principles, computational studies rarely share software frameworks, thereby impeding the integration or comparison of different results. Machine learning tools are also difficult to port to computational neuroscience since the experimental requirements are usually not well aligned. To address these challenges we introduce CoBeL-RL, a closed-loop simulator of complex behavior and learning based on RL and deep neural networks. It provides a neuroscience-oriented framework for efficiently setting up and running simulations. CoBeL-RL offers a set of virtual environments, e.g. T-maze and Morris water maze, which can be simulated at different levels of abstraction, e.g. a simple gridworld or a 3D environment with complex visual stimuli, and set up using intuitive GUI tools. A range of RL algorithms, e.g. Dyna-Q and deep Q-network algorithms, is provided and can be easily extended. CoBeL-RL provides tools for monitoring and analyzing behavior and unit activity, and allows for fine-grained control of the simulation via interfaces to relevant points in its closed-loop. In summary, CoBeL-RL fills an important gap in the software toolbox of computational neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold2, introduced by DeepMind in CASP14, demonstrated outstanding performance in predicting protein monomer structures. It could model more than 90% of targets with high accuracy, and so the next step would surely be multimer predictions, since many proteins do not act by themselves but with their binding partners. After the publication of After AlphaFold2, DeepMind published AlphaFold-Multimer, which showed excellent performance in predicting multimeric structures. However, its accuracy still has room for improvement compared to that of monomer predictions by AlphaFold2. In this paper, we introduce a fine-tuned version of AlphaFold-Multimer, named AFM-Refine-G, which uses structures predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer as inputs and produces more refined structures without the helps of multiple sequence alignments or templates. The performance of AFM-Refine-G was assessed using two datasets, Ghani_et_al_Benchmark2 and Yin_et_al_Hard, adapted from previous studies by Ghani et al. and Yin et al., respectively. The Ghani_et_al_Benchmark2 dataset consists of 17 recently published heteromers and the Yin_et_al_Hard dataset consists of 133 multimers, including immune-related complexes and repebody-antigen complexes, with several whose correct structure AlphaFold-Multimer could not predict. We predicted five models per target (750 models in total) and analyzed the improvement in the DockQ of each model. Of 750 models, 115 had DockQ improvement > 0.05 after refinement, demonstrating that our model is useful for the refinement of multimer structures. However, 14 structures had degraded DockQ < -0.05 after refinement, and the overall prediction quality for targets in Yin_et_al_Hard was quite low; 97 out of 133 were classified as  Incorrect with CAPRI criteria, revealing that there is still room for improving multimer predictions.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the structure of antibody-antigen complexes has tremendous value in biomedical research but unfortunately suffers from a poor performance in real-life applications. AlphaFold2 (AF2) has provided renewed hope for improvements in the field of protein-protein docking but has shown limited success for the medically relevant class of antibody-antigen complexes due to the lack of co-evolutionary constraints. Some research groups have demonstrated the usefulness of the AF2 confidence metrics for assessing the plausibility of protein folding models. In this study, we used physics-based protein docking methods for building decoy sets consisting of low-energy docking solutions that were either geometrically close to the native structure (positives) or not (negatives). The docking models were then fed into AF2 to assess their confidence with a novel composite score based on the pLDDT and pTMscore metrics. We show benefits of the AF2 composite score for rescoring docking poses in two scenarios: (1) a more trivial experiment based on the bound conformations of the antibody and antigen backbone structures, and (2) a more realistic test employing the unbound backbone conformations of the binding partners. Docking success rates improved after AF2 rescoring with particular emphasis on early enrichment of positives at the very top of the re-ranked list of decoys. The AF2 rescoring markedly improved classification of positives and negatives in most systems. Docking models of at least medium quality present in the decoy set, but not necessarily highly ranked by docking methods, benefitted most from AF2 rescoring by experiencing large advances towards the top of the reranked list of models. These improvements, obtained without any calibration or novel methodologies, led to a notable level of performance in antibody-antigen unbound docking that was never achieved previously.",

    "abstract": "Muscles act through elastic and dissipative elements to mediate movement, but these elements can introduce dissipation and filtering which are important for energetics and control. The high power requirements of flapping flight can be reduced by the insects exoskeleton, which acts as a structurally damped spring under purely sinusoidal deformation. However, this purely sinusoidal dynamic regime does not encompass the asymmetric wing strokes of many insects or non-periodic deformations induced by external perturbations. As such, it remains unknown whether a structural damping model applies broadly and what implications it has for control. We used a vibration testing system to measure the mechanical properties of isolated Manduca sexta thoraces under symmetric, asymmetric, and band-limited white noise deformations. We measured a thoracic stiffness of 2980 Nm-1 at 25 Hz and physiological peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.92 mm. Power savings and dissipation were indistinguishable between symmetric and asymmetric conditions, demonstrating that no additional energy is required to deform the thorax non-sinusoidally. Under white noise conditions, stiffness and damping were invariant with frequency, which is consistent with a structural damping model and suggests the thorax has no frequency-dependent filtering properties. A simple flat frequency response function fits our measured frequency response. This work demonstrates the potential of structurally damped materials to simplify motor control by eliminating any velocity-dependent filtering that viscoelastic elements usually impose between muscle and appendage.",

Immunoblotting revealed diverse impact of the mutations on the kinase, ranging from loss of function to significant increase in catalytic activity. Notably, Asn and Gly substitutions at the Asp-2113 position in ROS1 kinase domain were TKI- sensitive hyper-activating mutations, and transformative oncogenes in independent cell models. Molecular modeling revealed drastic alterations in the activation loop of ROS1D2113N compared to wildtype kinase. Proteomics studies showed that ROS1D2113N increases phosphorylation of known effectors akin to ROS1 fusions, and upregulates pathways not previously linked to ROS1, including mTORC2, JNK1/2, AP-1, TGFB1 and CCN1/2. In vivo, ROS1D2113N drove tumor formation that was sensitive to inhibition by crizotinib and lorlatinib.

The present work aims to examine the slight but likely relevant structural differences between pre- and post-hydrolysis states of outward-facing conformations as well as the interactions between MRP1 and the surrounding lipid bilayer. Global conformational dynamics show unfavourable extracellular opening associated with nucleotide binding domain dimerization indicating that the post-hydrolysis state adopts a close-cleft conformation rather than an outward-open conformation. Our present simulations also highlight persistent interactions with annular cholesterol molecules and the expected active role of lipid bilayer in the allosteric communication between distant domains of MRP1 transporter.",

    "abstract": "Buprenorphine (BUP) is the preferred treatment for opioid use disorder during pregnancy but can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). Norbuprenorphine (NorBUP), an active metabolite of BUP, is implicated in BUP-associated NOWS. We hypothesized that BUP, a low-efficacy agonist of mu opioid receptors, will not antagonize NorBUP, a high-efficacy agonist of mu opioid receptors, in producing NOWS. To test this hypothesis, we treated pregnant Long-Evans rats with BUP (0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg/day) {+/-} NorBUP (1 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 9 until pup delivery, and tested pups for opioid dependence using our established NOWS model. We used LC-MS-MS to quantify brain concentrations of BUP, NorBUP, and their glucuronide conjugates. BUP had little effect on NorBUP-induced NOWS, with the exception of 1 mg/kg/day BUP significantly increasing NorBUP-induced NOWS by 58% in females. BUP and NorBUP brain concentrations predicted NOWS in multiple linear regression models. Interestingly, NorBUP contributed more to NOWS in females ({beta}NorBUP = 51.34, p = 0.0001) than in males ({beta}NorBUP = 19.21, P = 0.093), while BUP was similar for females ({beta}BUP = 10.62, P = 0.0017) and males ({beta}BUP = 11.38, P = 0.009). We are the first to report that NorBUP induces NOWS in the presence of BUP and that there is sexual divergence in the contribution of NorBUP to BUP-associated NOWS. These findings suggest that females are more susceptible to NorBUP-induced NOWS, and that treatment strategies that reduce prenatal NorBUP exposure may be more effective for females than males.\n\nO_LIBuprenorphine does not antagonize fetal norbuprenorphine dependence.\nC_LIO_LIIn females, buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine have an additive effect.\nC_LIO_LINorbuprenorphine contributes to NOWS in females more than in males.\nC_LIO_LIThe glucuronide of norbuprenorphine accumulates in fetal brain.\nC_LIO_LIThe glucuronide of buprenorphine does not accumulate in fetal brain.\nC_LI",

We wanted to offer students an opportunity to learn computational skills and be part of a community while stuck at home. Because the pandemic created an unexpected research and academic situation, it was unclear how to best support students to learn and build community online. We used lessons learned from literature and our own experience to design, run and test an online program for students called the Science Coding Immersion Program (SCIP). In our program, students worked in teams for 8 hours a week, with one participant as the team leader and Zoom host. Teams worked on an online R or Python class at their own pace with support on Slack from the organizing team. For motivation and career advice, we hosted a weekly webinar with guest speakers. We used pre- and post-program surveys to determine how different aspects of the program impacted students. We were able to recruit a large and diverse group of participants who were happy with the program, found community in their team, and improved their coding confidence. We hope that our work will inspire others to start their own version of SCIP.",

Unlike the classical Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test and motivated by recent work on drug-resistance acquisition in cancer/microbial cells, we allow for the resistant cell state to switch back to a drug-sensitive state. This modification does not affect the central part of the (Luria-Delbruck) distribution of the number of resistant survivors: the previously developed approximation by the Landau probability density function applies. However, the right tail of the modified distribution deviates from the power law decay of the Landau distribution.

Gene regulatory network analysis linked individual lncRNAs to biological pathways and network centrality metrics identified network-essential, disease-associated regulatory lncRNAs. Regulatory lncRNAs with network-predicted target gene promoters enriched for triplex-based lncRNA binding were also identified. These findings elucidate hepatic lncRNA cell-type specificities, spatial zonation patterns, linked biological networks and dysregulation in disease progression.

Here we demonstrate that activity-dependent calcium signaling controls mitochondrial homeostasis and dendritic outgrowth via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in developing hippocampal neurons. AMPK deficiency phenocopies the inhibition of neuronal activity, inducing dendritic hypotrophy with abnormally elongated mitochondria. In growing dendrites, AMPK is activated by neuronal activity and dynamically oscillates in synchrony with calcium spikes, and this AMPK oscillation is inhibited by CaMKK2 knockdown. AMPK activation leads to phosphorylation of MFF and ULK1, which initiate mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, respectively. Dendritic mitochondria in AMPK-depleted neurons exhibit impaired fission and mitophagy and display multiple signs of dysfunction. Thus, AMPK activity is finely tuned by the calcium-CaMKK2 pathway and regulates mitochondrial homeostasis by facilitating removal of damaged components in rapidly growing neurons during normal brain development.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor (SMR) neurofeedback is a promising therapy for several health disorders but is still not widely used due to the high cost of the equipment. URGOnight offers a low-cost solution to democratize these therapies by providing an at-home EEG headband with dry electrodes connected to a mobile application. The first aim of this study is both to validate the URGOnight EEG signal and to compare it to Enobio-20, a medical grade EEG device. The second aim of the study is to propose a new method to detect SMR rhythm based on its oscillatory properties and discriminate it from alpha oscillations.\n\nIn our study, we compared the URGOnight headband EEG signal (C3/C4) to Enobio-20 (CP3/CP4), placed on subjects simultaneously equipped with the two headbands. All subjects (n=33) performed a dual blocking task inspired by Kulhman (1978) based on the blocking effect of movement and eyes opening on SMR and alpha respectively. This task was followed by SSVEP stimulations to evaluate the frequency response of the two EEG devices. The performance of the EEG headbands was statistically identical for most of the characteristics of the EEG signal, including the frequency response to SSVEP (from 4Hz to 20Hz). The main difference was a larger amplitude in the 8-15Hz due to the location of the reference in URGOnight that did not impair the detection of both alpha and SMR.\n\nIn addition, we show that our new method allows to discriminate alpha and SMR rhythms based on their oscillatory properties with a single recording site (C3/C4). The method is fast enough to be used in real time. We show that the detected SMR rhythm is modulated by movement as opposed to the 12-15Hz frequency band often used as indicator of SMR in most neurofeedback studies.\n\nAltogether, our results validate the quality of the EEG recordings obtained with URGOnight since it gives similar results as the one obtained with Enobio-20, a validated EEG medical grade system. In addition, we provide a new method allowing the identification and the separation of the alpha and SMR with a single recording site C3/C4. This method opens up a new research lead to improve SMR neurofeedback efficiency and thus of its clinical possibilities by focusing on the reinforcement of the SMR oscillation strictly speaking.\n\nHighlights- Validation of the URGOnight EEG device suitable for neurofeedback at home\n- New method for the detection and the discrimination of alpha rhythm and SMR rhythm with a small number of recording sites\n- The oscillatory activity related to the SMR displays different properties compared to the 12-15Hz frequency band.\n- Description of a full validation procedure for wireless EEG devices usable at home for neurofeedback\n- Comparison of the signal of URGOnight (dry electrodes) with a wet electrode EEG device",

We demonstrate the strength of the two by comparing their outcomes to other genotype inference methods and validated the genotype approach with independent genomic long read data.\n\nThe naming scheme is compatible with current annotation tools and pipelines. Analysis results can be converted from the proposed naming scheme to the nomenclature determined by the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS). Both the naming scheme and the genotype procedure are implemented in a freely available R package (PIgLET).

    "abstract": "RNA viruses have been shown to express various short RNAs, some of which have regulatory roles during replication, transcription, and translation of viral genomes. However, short viral RNAs (svRNAs) generated by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 remained largely unexplored, mainly due limitations of the widely used library preparation methods for small RNA deep sequencing and corresponding data processing. By analyzing publicly available small RNA-seq datasets, we observed that human cells infected by SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 produce multiple short viral RNAs (svRNAs), ranging in size from 15 to 26 nt and deriving predominantly from (+) RNA strands. In addition, we verified the presence of the five most abundant SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung adenocarcinoma cells by qPCR. Interestingly, the copy number of the observed SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs dramatically exceeded the expression of previously reported viral miRNAs in the same cells. We hypothesize that the reported SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs could serve as biomarkers for early infection stages due to their high abundance. Finally, we found that both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induced up- and down-regulation of multiple endogenous human short RNAs that align predominantly to protein-coding and lncRNA transcripts. Interestingly, a significant proportion of short RNAs derived from full-length viral genomes also aligned to various hg38 sequences, suggesting opportunities to investigate regulatory roles of svRNAs during infection. Further characterization of the small RNA landscape of both viral and host genomes is clearly warranted to improve our understanding of molecular events related to infection and to design more efficient strategies for therapeutic interventions as well as early diagnosis.",

In particular, due to their implications within many biological contexts, lateral-inhibition mechanisms present in the Notch-Delta signalling pathway led to an extensive discussion between biologists and mathematicians. Deterministic and stochastic models have been developed as a consequence of this discussion, some of which address long-range signalling by considering cell protrusions reaching non-neighbouring cells. The dynamics of such signalling systems reveal intricate properties of the coupling terms involved in these models. In this work, we examine the benefits and limitations of new and existing models of cell signalling and differentiation in a variety of contexts. Using linear and weakly nonlinear stability analyses, we find that pattern selection relies on nonlinear effects that are not covered by such analytical methods.",

Size based methods could provide fast and transparent assessments, but they require information on fish sizes. Citizen science programs, social media and smart phone applications generate millions of georeferenced fish images globally. Machine learning based fish species and size identification could help turn these images into valuable data for population status assessments. We present a machine learning, image classification based method to identify fish size classes from photos of anglers holding fish. To train the model we group images into ten 5-10 cm size classes, similar to classes used in underwater visual fish surveys. The model was trained using 2602 images from angler citizen science platforms MyCatch and FishSizeProject. Although the number of images was limited, the model achieved an overall accuracy of ~50%. Importantly, the misidentification of size classes was consistent across 20 separate model training rounds, each conducted with an independent, random allocation of images for training and test datasets. Our method suggests that photo based fish size class identification is feasible, and that prediction uncertainty should be incorporated into subsequent analysis, as it is done with fish ageing errors in fisheries stock assessments.",

    "abstract": "The risk of predation directly affects physiology, behavior, and fitness of wild birds. Social interactions with conspecifics may affect how individuals respond to stressors such as predators. Strong social connections could help individuals recover from a stressful experience; however, competitive interactions also have the potential to exacerbate stress. Few studies have investigated the interaction between environmental stressors and the social landscape in wild bird populations. Here, we experimentally simulated predation attempts on breeding female tree swallows (Tachicyneta bicolor). At the same time, we manipulated female breast plumage color, a key social signal. Simulated predation events on tree swallows negatively affected their nestlings condition, telomere lengths, and fledging success. However, the effects of experimental manipulations were timing-dependent: simulated predation during the early nestling period was more detrimental than \"predation\" during incubation. Contrary to our expectations, manipulation of the social environment did not affect the response of tree swallows to simulated predation. However, manipulating female plumage during the nestling period did affect nestling size, indicating an effect of the social environment on reproductive success. Our data demonstrate that transient stressors on breeding female birds can have carry-over effects on their nestlings, some of which may be long-lasting.",

Response requires perception. Recent advances in machine learning may provide a solution. A randomly connected network creates a reservoir of perceptive information about the recent history of environmental states. In each time step, a relatively small number of inputs drives the dynamics of the relatively large network. Over time, the internal network states retain memory of past inputs. To achieve a functional response to past states or to predict future states, a system must learn only how to match states of the reservoir to the target response. In the same way, a random biochemical or neural network of an organism can provide an initial perceptive basis. With a solution for one side of the two-step perception-response challenge, evolving an adaptive response may not be so difficult. Two broader themes emerge. First, organisms may often achieve precise traits from sloppy components. Second, evolutionary puzzles often follow the same outlines as the challenges of machine learning. In each case, the basic problem is how to learn, either by artificial computational methods or by natural selection.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila has been a powerful model system for biological studies due to the wide range of genetic tools established for it. Among these tools, Gal4 is the most abundant, offering unparalleled tissue- and developmental stage-specificity for gene manipulation. In comparison, other genetic reagents are far fewer in choices. Here we present a genetic toolkit for converting Gal4 strains into LexA and Flippase transgenes through simple genetic crosses and fluorescence screening. We demonstrate the proof-of-principle by converting ten Gal4 lines that exhibit diverse tissue specificities and examined the activity patterns of the converted LexA and Flippase lines. Gal4-to-LexA and Flp conversion is fast and convenient and should greatly expand the choices of LexA and Flp for binary expression and FRT-based mosaic analysis, respectively, in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Current screening and diagnostic tools for traumatic brain injury (TBI) have limitations in sensitivity and prognostication. Aberrant protease activity is a central process that drives disease progression in TBI and is associated with worsened prognosis; thus direct measurements of protease activity could provide more diagnostic information. In this study, we engineered a nanosensor that releases a measurable signal into the blood and urine in response to activity from the TBI-associated protease calpain. Readouts from our nanosensor were designed to be compatible with ELISA and lateral flow assays, clinically-relevant assay modalities. In a mouse model of TBI, we demonstrated greater sensitivity of the nanosensor with the addition of targeting ligands to hyaluronic acid. In evaluation of mice with mild or severe injuries, our nanosensor identified mild TBI with a higher sensitivity than the clinical biomarker GFAP. This nanosensor technology allows for measurement of TBI-associated proteases without the need to directly access brain tissue, and has the potential to complement existing TBI diagnostic tools.",

    "abstract": "Partial liver resections are routinely performed in living donor liver transplantation and to debulk tumors in liver malignancies, but surgical decisions on vessel reconstruction for adequate inflow and outflow are challenging. Pre-operative evaluation is often limited to radiological imaging, which fails to account for post-resection hemodynamic alterations. Substantial evidence suggests post-surgical increase in local volume flow rate enhances shear stress, signaling hepatic regeneration, but excessive shear stress has been postulated to result in small for size syndrome and liver failure. Predicting hemodynamic alterations throughout the liver is particularly challenging due to the dendritic architecture the vasculature, spanning several orders of magnitude in diameter. Therefore, we developed a mathematical lumped parameter model with realistic heterogeneities capturing inflow/outflow of the human liver to simulate acute perfusion alterations following surgical resection. Our model is parameterized using clinical measurements, relies on a single free parameter, and accurately captures established perfusion characteristics. We quantify acute changes in volume flow rate, flow speed, and wall shear stress following variable, realistic liver resections and make comparisons to the intact liver. Our numerical model runs in minutes and can be adapted to patient-specific anatomy, providing a novel computational tool aimed at assisting pre- and intra-operative surgical decisions for liver resections.",

Existing web tools supporting online survival analysis are gradually failing to meet the increasing demands of researchers in terms of the dataset size, richness of survival analysis methods, and diversity of customization features. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a large-scale, one-stop pan-cancer survival analysis web server. We developed PanCanSurvPlot (https://smuonco.shinyapps.io/PanCanSurvPlot/), a Shiny web tool that has incorporated a total of 215 cancer-related datasets from the GEO and TCGA databases, covering nearly 100,000 genes (mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs), approximately 45,000 samples, 51 different cancer types, and 13 different survival outcomes. The website also provides two cutoff methods based on median and optimal cutpoints. All survival analysis results from the log-rank test and univariate Cox regression are presented in a clear and straightforward summary table. Finally, users can customize color schemes and cutpoint levels to quickly obtain high-quality Kaplan-Meier survival plots that meet publication requirements.",

    "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) increases lifespan in many organisms, but its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Mitochondria play a central role in metabolic regulation and are known to undergo changes in structure and function in response to DR. Mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m) is the driving force for ATP production and mitochondrial outputs that integrate many cellular signals. One such signal regulated by {Delta}{psi}m is nutrient-status sensing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that DR promotes longevity through preserved {Delta}{psi}m during adulthood. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that {Delta}{psi}m declines with age relatively early in the lifespan, and this decline is attenuated by DR. Pharmacologic depletion of {Delta}{psi}m blocked the longevity and health benefits of DR. Genetic perturbation of {Delta}{psi}m and mitochondrial ATP availability similarly prevented lifespan extension from DR. Taken together, this study provides further evidence that appropriate regulation of {Delta}{psi}m is a critical factor for health and longevity in response to DR.",

    "abstract": "A low potassium (K+) intake is a common situation in the population of the Westernized countries where processed food is prevalent in the diet. Here, we show that expression of GDF15, a TGF{beta}-related growth factor, is increased in renal tubular segments and gut parts of mice in response to low-K+ diet leading to a systemic elevation of its plasma and urine concentration. In human, under mild dietary K+ restriction, we observed that urine GDF15 excretion is correlated with plasma K+ level. Conversely to WT mice, adaptation to K+ restriction of GDF15-KO mice is not optimal, they do not increase their number of type A intercalated cell, responsible for K+ retention, and have a delayed renal K+ retention, leading to early development of hypokalemia. This renal effect of GDF15 depends on ErBb2 receptor, whose expression is increased in the kidney collecting ducts. We also observe that, in the absence of GDF15, the release of K+ by the muscles is blunted which is compensated by a loss of muscle mass. Thus, in this study, we showed that GDF15 plays a central role in the response to K+ restriction by orchestrating the modification of the cell composition of the collecting duct.",

Therefore, we examined muscle and muscle-tendon unit behaviour during diagonal style roller skiing at three speed and incline conditions.\n\nWe assessed lower leg muscle and muscle-tendon unit mechanics and muscle activity in thirteen high-level skiers during treadmill roller skiing using synchronised ultrasound, motion capture, electromyography and ski-binding force measurements. Participants skied using diagonal style at 2.5 and 3.5 m{middle dot}s-1 at 5{degrees}, and at 2.5 m{middle dot}s-1 at 10{degrees}.\n\nWe found an uncoupling of muscle and joint behaviour during most parts of the propulsive kick phase in all conditions (P<0.01). Gastrocnemius muscle fascicles actively shortened ~9 mm during the kick phase, while the muscle-tendon unit went through a stretch-shortening cycle. Peak muscle-tendon unit shortening velocity was five times higher than fascicle velocity (375 vs 74 mm{middle dot}s-1, P<0.01). Increased incline was met by greater muscle activity (24%, P=0.04) and slower fascicle shortening velocities (34 vs. 45 mm{middle dot}s-1, P<0.01). Increased speed was met by greater peak muscle activity (23%, P<0.01) and no change in fascicle shortening velocity.\n\nOur data show that muscle behaviour was uncoupled from the joint movement, which enables beneficial contractile conditions and energy utilisation during diagonal style at different slopes and speeds. Active preloading in the end of the glide phase may benefit the mechanisms.\n\nSummary statementWe examined muscle function during diagonal style cross country skiing in competitive cross-country skiers.

    "abstract": "The brainstem and hypothalamic structures implementing the daily cycles of wake, REM and NREM sleep have now been identified in remarkable detail. However, sleep structure dynamically adapts to environmental stressors, likely requiring top-down cortical feedback that is as yet unidentified. Here, we investigate the role of projections from prefrontal cortex (PFC), a key hub in stress regulation, to the ventro-lateral preoptic areas (VLPO), a master regulator of sleep states. Using ex vivo optogenetics, we demonstrate that activation of PFC terminals induces monosynaptic excitatory glutamatergic currents in VLPO NREM-promoting neurons. In vivo, activation of PFC-VLPO projections interrupts ongoing REM in favour of NREM, leading to fragmented REM bouts. Remarkably, chemogenetic inhibition of PFC-VLPO projections has no effect in baseline conditions but it blocks the REM fragmentation induced by Social Defeat Stress. Therefore, the PFC-VLPO pathway provides a top-down regulation specifically recruited in stressful conditions to induce short, fragmented REM bouts and favor NREM sleep.",

    "abstract": "Cortical slow waves and delta waves are hallmarks of NREM sleep and key elements in physiological processes such as memory consolidation and sleep homeostasis. However, no clear distinction has been made between the two types of electrophysiological events. We introduce a new distinction between slow waves, large amplitude waves on filtered LFP cortical signals, and delta waves, characterized by an inversion between deep and superficial layers and the co-occurrence with a cortical down state. Detection of slow waves, as large amplitude waves during NREM sleep, reveals that a large portion of them does not share the properties of delta waves and does not co-occur with cortical down states. Therefore, we distinguish type-1 slow waves, that are associated to a down state, from type-2 slow waves. We show that 1) only type-1 slow waves undergo strong homeostatic regulations and 2) type-2 slow waves create confusion about the temporal link with hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. Thus, we confirm that delta waves detected with our new method can be used as a proxy for down state. Altogether, this confirms the importance of a robust and accurate definition of delta waves to understand the fine neurophysiological mechanisms at stake during NREM sleep.",

    "abstract": "The learning of new motor skills constitutes an inseparable part of our lives. Motor consolidation refers to the offline processing of motor memories following the acquisition of new motor skills. The animal literature suggests that the primary motor cortex (M1) plays a key role in motor memory consolidation, and structural and functional plasticity in M1 following motor consolidation have been demonstrated. However, the mechanisms supporting motor memory consolidation and plasticity in the human M1 are not well understood. Initial human neuroimaging studies show that the initial stages of motor learning in humans are accompanied by short-term temporal dynamics of the brains main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters - Glutamate (Glu) and GABA - in M1, but it remains unclear how these relate to the question of motor memory consolidation.\n\nHere, we show that early Glu and GABA modifications in M1 following motor skill learning may play vital roles in supporting motor memory consolidation and neural plasticity that take place over longer time scales. Using a multimodal magnetic resonance approach implemented on ultra-high field 7T scanner in healthy young adults (n=36), we found increased Glu and decreased GABA in M1 during the initial offline period following learning to support consolidation-related local and inter-regional functions of M1, such as motor memory reactivation and increased functional connectivity with the striatum. These neurochemical changes also correlated with overnight structural and functional plasticity expressed as increased M1 grey matter volume and functional connectivity, while Glu modifications also correlated with adaptive behavior, as reflected by improvements in skill performance.\n\nOur results provide intriguing microscale mechanistic evidence to the potential distinctive roles of Glu and GABA in promoting motor memory consolidation and plasticity in the human M1. They also highlight a role for early neurochemical modifications to memory consolidation and plasticity in the human brain and may hold important clinical implications in rehabilitative settings such as in stroke and brain injury.",

    "abstract": "For an organ to maintain proper architecture and function, its different component cell-types must coordinate their cell-shapes with each other through life. While cell-intrinsic developmental mechanisms driving homotypic cell-cell coordination are known, how heterotypic cells collectively regulate cell-shape is less-clear. We report that, in a sense-organ, epithelial cells delimit and maintain polarity domains of contacting glia, and thereby, associated neuron shapes throughout life. Briefly, Hsp co-chaperone UNC-23/BAG2 keeps epithelial apical domains from deforming with animal movement. Epithelial apical domains stretch aberrantly and progressively in adult unc-23 mutant animals, which in an FGFR-dependent manner, dislocates glial apical cytoskeleton proteins SMA-1/{beta}H-Spectrin and actin. This alters glial apical polarity and cell shape, and concomitantly, associated neuron-ending shape. Notably, UNC-23 acts temporally at a developmental critical period to maintain glia-neuron shape in adults, and spatially within a defined anatomical zone. Lastly, intervention in either epithelia, glia or neuron ameliorate or phenocopy unc-23 neural defects. Epi/endothelia resist mechanical stress and contact glia-neuron units across central/peripheral nervous systems and species, and all components of the identified molecular pathway are conserved and disease-relevant. Thus, we posit that analogous epithelia-glia mechanobiological coupling may broadly regulate glia-neuron shapes through animal life.",
