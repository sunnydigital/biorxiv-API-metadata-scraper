    "abstract": "Plasmids are mobile genetic elements found across all domains of life. As plasmids often encode determinants of fitness, their evolution is intertwined with their hosts. However, naturally occurring plasmids remain far less understood than their hosts due to the lack of frameworks to recognize plasmids and to classify them into evolutionary groups. Here we trained a machine learning model that recognizes plasmids based on genetic architecture with state-of-the-art accuracy. We applied this model to a global collection of human gut metagenomes to identify 68,350 unique plasmids, 13,280 of which had a very high model confidence and represent more than an order of magnitude increase over the number of known plasmids that we detected in this environment. To understand the evolution of these plasmids, we developed a generalizable approach that enabled us to define 1,169  plasmid systems. Each system consists of plasmids that share a backbone sequence containing core plasmid functions, such as replication and conjugation, but vary in cargo genes that are often critical to the host, such as antibiotic resistance, amino acid biosynthesis, and tRNA modification. Members of the same system are often found in geographically distinct human populations, revealing cargo genes that likely respond to environmental selection. The ecological patterns of plasmids we observed could not be explained by microbial taxonomy. This work uncovers the tremendous diversity of plasmids and demonstrates the need to characterize them as a separate component of microbiomes distinct from their hosts.",

    "abstract": "Identification and characterisation of novel targets for treatment is a priority in the field of psychiatry. FKBP5 is a gene with decades of evidence suggesting its pathogenic role in a subset of psychiatric patients, with potential to be leveraged as a therapeutic target for these individuals. While it is widely reported that FKBP5/FKBP51 mRNA/protein (FKBP5/1) expression is impacted by psychiatric disease state, risk genotype and age, it is not known in which cell-types and sub-anatomical areas of the human brain this occurs. This knowledge is critical to propel FKBP5/1-targeted treatment development. Here, we performed an extensive, large-scale postmortem study (n=1024) of FKBP5/1 examining prefrontal cortex (BA9, BA11, BA24) derived from subjects that lived with schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder. With an extensive battery of RNA (bulk RNA sequencing, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, microarray, qPCR, RNAscope) and protein (immunoblot, immunohistochemistry) analysis approaches, we thoroughly investigated the effects of disease-state, aging and genotype on cortical FKBP5/1 expression including in a cell-type specific manner. We identified consistently heightened FKBP5/1 levels in psychopathology and with age, but not genotype, with these effects strongest in schizophrenia. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and targeted histology, we established that these disease- and aging-effects on FKBP5/1 expression were most pronounced in excitatory supragranular neurons. We then found that this increase in FKBP5 levels likely impacts on synaptic plasticity, as FKBP5 gex levels strongly and inversely correlated with dendritic mushroom spine density and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in supragranular neurons. These findings pinpoint a novel cellular and molecular mechanism that has significant potential to open a new avenue of FKBP51 drug development to treat cognitive symptoms in psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "In insects and mammals, olfactory experience in early life alters olfactory behavior and function in later life. In the vinegar fly Drosophila, flies chronically exposed to a high concentration of a monomolecular odor exhibit reduced behavioral aversion to the familiar odor when it is re- encountered. This change in olfactory behavior has been attributed to selective decreases in the sensitivity of second-order olfactory projection neurons (PNs) in the antennal lobe that respond to the overrepresented odor. However, since odorant compounds do not occur at similarly high concentrations in natural sources, the role of odor experience-dependent plasticity in natural environments is unclear. Here, we investigated olfactory plasticity in the antennal lobe of flies chronically exposed to odors at concentrations that are typically encountered in natural odor sources. These stimuli were chosen to each strongly and selectively excite a single PN type to saturating firing rates, facilitating a rigorous assessment of the selectivity of olfactory plasticity for PNs directly excited by overrepresented stimuli. Unexpectedly, we found that chronic exposure to three such odors did not result in decreased PN sensitivity, but rather mildly increased responses to weak stimuli in most PN types. Odor-evoked PN activity in response to stronger stimuli was mostly unaffected by odor experience. When present, plasticity was observed broadly in multiple PN types and thus was not selective for PNs receiving direct input from the chronically active ORNs. We further investigated the DL5 olfactory coding channel and found that chronic odor-mediated excitation of its input ORNs did not affect PN intrinsic properties, local inhibitory innervation, ORN responses, or ORN-PN synaptic strength; however, broad-acting lateral excitation evoked by some odors was increased. These results show that PN odor coding is only mildly affected by strong persistent activation of a single olfactory input, highlighting the stability of early stages of insect olfactory processing to significant perturbations in the sensory environment.",

    "abstract": "Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs/Timps) are an endogenous family of widely expressed matrisome-associated proteins that were initially identified as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase activity (Metzincin family proteases). Consequently, TIMPs are often considered simply as protease inhibitors by many investigators. However, an evolving list of new metalloproteinase-independent functions for TIMP family members suggests that this concept is outdated. These novel TIMP functions include direct agonism/antagonism of multiple transmembrane receptors, as well as functional interactions with matrisome targets. While the family was fully identified over two decades ago, there has yet to be an in-depth study describing the expression of TIMPs in normal tissues of adult mammals. An understanding of the tissues and cell-types that express TIMPs 1 through 4, in both normal and disease states are important to contextualize the growing functional capabilities of TIMP proteins, which are often dismissed as non-canonical. Using publicly available single cell RNA sequencing data from the Tabula Muris Consortium, we analyzed approximately 100,000 murine cells across eighteen tissues from non-diseased organs, representing seventy-three annotated cell types, to define the diversity in Timp gene expression across healthy tissues. We describe the unique expression profiles across tissues and organ-specific cell types that all four Timp genes display. Within annotated cell-types, we identify clear and discrete cluster-specific patterns of Timp expression, particularly in cells of stromal and endothelial origins. RNA in-situ hybridization across four organs expands on the scRNA sequencing analysis, revealing novel compartments associated with individual Timp expression. These analyses provide evidence of the biological significance of Timp expression in the identified cell sub-types, which are consistent with novel roles in normal tissue homeostasis and changing roles in disease progression. This understanding of the tissues, specific cell types and microenvironment conditions in which Timp genes are expressed adds important physiological context to the growing array of novel functions for TIMP proteins.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes are hypothesized to have evolved from more primitive protocells. Unlike present-day cells, protocells are thought to have been devoid of complex molecular biological processes. They are believed to have mediated reproduction entirely by biophysical forces under favorable environmental conditions. Despite this proposition, little is known about the actual mechanism of their reproduction. To understand the reproduction process of protocells in their native habitat, here we used a top-down approach to transform bacterial cells into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state. Given that environmental conditions are thought to have played an essential role in mediating protocell reproduction, we then studied these cells under the presumed environmental conditions of Archaean Eon Earth. Even in the absence of functioning biological processes, cells in our study reproduced in a defined sequence of steps, always leading to the formation of viable daughter cells. Their reproduction mechanism can be explained by the interaction between intracellular metabolism, physicochemical properties of cell constituents, and, most importantly, environmental conditions. Given the simplicity of this reproduction mechanism and its suitability to environmental conditions of early Earth, we propose that protocells reproduced by this process. Moreover, this method of reproduction is also in tune with the earlier theoretical propositions on protocells, the results of the top- down approach of building a minimal cell, and the paleontological record of the Achaean Eon. Our study is the first to bridge the gap between non-living systems like lipid vesicles, living cells, and the paleontology of the Archaean Eon.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMitochondria are maternally inherited cell organelles with their own genome, and perform various functions in eukaryotic cells such as energy production and cellular homeostasis. Due to their inheritance and manifold biological roles in health and disease, mitochondrial genetics serves a dual purpose of tracing the history as well as disease susceptibility of human populations across the globe. This work requires a comprehensive catalogue of commonly observed genetic variations in the mitochondrial DNAs for all regions throughout the world. So far, however, certain regions, such as North and East Africa have been understudied.\n\nObjectivesTo address this shortcoming, we have created the most comprehensive quality-controlled North and East African mitochondrial dataset to date and use it for characterizing mitochondrial genetic variation in this region.\n\nMethodsWe compiled 11 published cohorts with novel data for mitochondrial genomes from 159 Sudanese individuals. We combined these 641 mitochondrial sequences with sequences from the 1000 Genomes (n=2,504) and the Human Genome Diversity Project (n=828) and used the tool haplocheck for extensive quality control and detection of in-sample contamination, as well as Nanopore long read sequencing for haplogroup validation of 18 samples.\n\nResultsUsing a subset of high-coverage mitochondrial sequences, we predict 15 potentially novel haplogroups in North and East African subjects and observe likely phylogenetic deviations from the established PhyloTree reference for haplogroups L0a1 and L2a1.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate common hitherto unexplored variants in mitochondrial genomes of North and East Africa that lead to novel phylogenetic relationships between haplogroups present in these regions. These observations call for further in-depth population genetic studies in that region to enable the prospective use of mitochondrial genetic variation for precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "The spatial extent to which elastic deformations of cross-linked filaments persist in noisy active environments and the associated decay length plays a fundamental role in many biological settings. Here, we study the mechanical response of an active ordered composite comprised of elastic filaments sheared by active motors. We compare results from Brownian multi-particle collision dynamics-based numerical simulations for actively driven deformations of noisy and moderately soft composites with theoretical predictions from a mean-field theory valid in the noiseless and weakly elastic limit. Surprisingly, several qualitative features predicted by the noise-less mean field model are seen even in strongly noisy simulations. We find, from both theory and simulations, that even when extensibility is negligible locally, it cannot be ignored when considering global deformation fields. This is because the length scale over which extensional deformations persist is controlled by the competition between passive elasticity of the filament and active effective shear stiffening due to attached motors and other crosslinks. Specifically, for fixed motor kinetics and properties, the decay length of extensional deformations is controlled by the ratio of the passive elastic modulus of the composite to an effective active, motor generated shear modulus. For steady strains, the length scale is surprisingly independent of motor activity except when motors are in a state of rigor. For oscillatory strains, the persistence length may be varied strongly by changing the frequency of forcing. When the effect of noise is dominant, the strain fields on the filament becomes uncorrelated. Our study demonstrates how correlated activity in natural ordered active matter possesses a finite range of influence with testable experimental implications.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders are on the rise worldwide, with diagnoses that detect derailment from typical milestones by 3-4.5 years of age. By then, the circuitry in the brain has already reached some level of maturation that inevitably takes neurodevelopment through a different course. There is a critical need then to develop analytical methods that detect problems much earlier and identify targets for treatment. We integrate data from multiple sources, including neonatal auditory brainstem responses (ABR), clinical criteria detecting autism years later in those neonates, and similar ABR information for young infants and children who also received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders, to produce the earliest known digital screening biomarker to flag neurodevelopmental derailment in neonates. This work also defines concrete targets for treatment and offers a new statistical approach to aid in guiding a personalized course of maturation in line with the highly nonlinear, accelerated neurodevelopmental rates of change in early infancy.\n\nSignificance StatementAutism is currently detected on average after 4.5 years of age, based on differences in social interactions. Yet basic building blocks that develop to scaffold social interactions are present at birth and quantifiable at clinics. Auditory Brainstem Response tests, routinely given to neonates, infants, and young children, contain information about delays in signal transmission important for sensory integration. Although currently discarded as gross data under traditional statistical approaches, new analytics reveal unambiguous differences in ABR signals fluctuations between typically developing neonates and those who received an autism diagnosis. With very little effort and cost, these new analytics could be added to the clinical routine testing of neonates to create a universal screening tool for neurodevelopmental derailment and prodrome of autism.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic architecture of complex traits is important to many geneticists, including those interested in human disease, plant and animal breeding, and evolutionary genetics. Advances in sequencing technology and statistical methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have allowed for the identification of more variants with smaller effect sizes, however, many of these identified polymorphisms fail to be replicated in subsequent studies. In addition to sampling variation, this failure to replicate reflects the complexities introduced by factors including environmental variation, genetic background, and differences in allele frequencies among populations. Using Drosophila melanogaster wing shape, we ask if we can replicate allelic effects of polymorphisms first identified in a GWAS (Pitchers et al. 2019) in three genes: dachsous (ds), extra-macrochaete (emc) and neuralized (neur), using artificial selection in the lab, and bulk segregant mapping in natural populations. We demonstrate that multivariate wing shape changes associated with these genes are aligned with major axes of phenotypic and genetic variation in natural populations. Following seven generations of artificial selection along the ds shape change vector, we observe genetic differentiation of variants in ds and genomic regions containing other genes in the hippo signaling pathway. This suggests a shared direction of effects within a developmental network. We also performed artificial selection with the emc shape change vector, which is not a part of the hippo signaling network, but showed a largely shared direction of effects. The response to selection along the emc vector was similar to that of ds, suggesting that the available genetic diversity of a population, summarized by the genetic (co)variance matrix (G), influenced alleles captured by selection. Despite the success with artificial selection, bulk segregant analysis using natural populations did not detect these same variants, likely due to the contribution of environmental variation and low minor allele frequencies, coupled with small effect sizes of the contributing variants.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence have paved the way for leveraging hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tumor slides for precision oncology. We present ENLIGHT-DeepPT, an approach for predicting response to multiple targeted and immunotherapies from H&E-slides. In difference from existing approaches that aim to predict treatment response directly from the slides, ENLIGHT-DeepPT is an indirect two-step approach consisting of (1) DeepPT, a new deep-learning framework that predicts genome-wide tumor mRNA expression from slides, and (2) ENLIGHT, which predicts response based on the DeepPT inferred expression values. DeepPT successfully predicts transcriptomics in all 16 TCGA cohorts tested and generalizes well to two independent datasets. Importantly, ENLIGHT-DeepPT successfully predicts true responders in five independent patients cohorts involving four different treatments spanning six cancer types with an overall odds ratio of 2.44, increasing the baseline response rate by 43.47% among predicted responders, without the need for any treatment data for training. Furthermore, its prediction accuracy on these datasets is comparable to a supervised approach predicting the response directly from the images, trained and tested on the same cohort in cross validation. Its future application could provide clinicians with rapid treatment recommendations to an array of different therapies and importantly, may contribute to advancing precision oncology in developing countries.\n\nStatement of SignificanceENLIGHT-DeepPT is the first approach shown to successfully predict response to multiple targeted and immune cancer therapies from H&E slides. In distinction from all previous H&E slides prediction approaches, it does not require supervised training on a specific cohort for each drug/indication treatment but is trained to predict expression on the TCGA cohort and then can predict response to an array of treatments without any further training. ENLIGHT-DeepPT can provide rapid treatment recommendations to oncologists and help advance precision oncology in underserved regions and low-income countries.",

Here, we characterize LRPPRC as an mRNA delivery factor and report its cryo-EM structure in complex with SLIRP, mRNA and the mitoribosome. The structure shows that LRPPRC associates with the mitoribosomal proteins mS39 and the N-terminus of mS31 through recognition of the LRPPRC helical repeats. Together, the proteins form a corridor for hand-off the mRNA. The mRNA is directly bound to SLIRP, which also has a stabilizing function for LRPPRC. To delineate the effect of LRPPRC on individual mitochondrial transcripts, we used an RNAseq approach, metabolic labeling and mitoribosome profiling that showed a major influence on ND1, ND2, ATP6, COX1, COX2, and COX3 mRNA translation efficiency. Our data suggest that LRPPRC-SLIRP acts in recruitment of mitochondrial mRNAs to modulate their translation.

    "abstract": "We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the cortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using prediction errors. As a result, lower levels form representations that encode sequences at shorter timescales (e.g., a single step) while higher levels form representations that encode sequences at longer timescales (e.g., an entire sequence). We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation is implemented as a low-dimensional mixture of possible temporal dynamics. When trained on natural videos, the lower-level model neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those of simple cells in the primary visual cortex while the higher-level responses spanned longer timescales, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. Additionally, the networks hierarchical sequence representation exhibited both predictive and postdictive effects resembling those observed in visual motion processing in humans (e.g., the flash-lag illusion). When coupled with an associative memory mimicking the role of the hippocampus, the model allowed episodic memories to be stored and retrieved, supporting cue-triggered recall of an input sequence similar to activity recall in the visual cortex. Taken together, our results suggest that cortical processing and learning of sequences can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical spatiotemporal generative model of the visual world.",

    "abstract": "Molecular genetic analyses in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana have demonstrated the major roles of different CAM-BINDING PROTEIN 60 (CBP60) proteins in growth, stress signaling, and immune responses. Prominently, CBP60g and SARD1 are paralogous CBP60 transcription factors that regulate numerous components of the immune system, such as cell surface and intracellular immune receptors, MAP kinases, WRKY transcription factors, and biosynthetic enzymes for immunity-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). However, their function, regulation and diversification in most species remain unclear. Here we have created CBP60-DB, a structural and bioinformatic database that comprehensively characterized 1052 CBP60 gene homologs (encoding 2376 unique transcripts and 1996 unique proteins) across 62 phylogenetically diverse genomes in the plant kingdom. We have employed deep learning-predicted structural analyses using AlphaFold2 and then generated dedicated web pages for all plant CBP60 proteins. Importantly, we have generated a novel clustering visualization algorithm to interrogate kingdom-wide structural similarities for more efficient inference of conserved functions across various plant taxa. Because well-characterized CBP60 proteins in Arabidopsis are known to be transcription factors with putative calmodulin-binding domains, we have integrated external bioinformatic resources to analyze protein domains and motifs. Collectively, we present a plant kingdom-wide identification of this important protein family in a user-friendly AlphaFold-anchored database, representing a novel and significant resource for the broader plant biology community.",

    "abstract": "In the 1940s, the Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC) started a grapevine breeding program to develop new cultivars adapted to the tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil. More than 2,000 crosses were carried out over 50 years, using 850 varieties as parents. However, among the thousands of hybrids developed by the program, only 130 are still maintained in the IAC grapevine germplasm collection. Little is known about their genetic makeup and usefulness for current breeding programs. In this study, we genotyped 130 Brazilian grape hybrids at 21 polymorphic microsatellite markers to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of the hybrids and verified their disclosed pedigrees. The results showed that the hybrid collection is highly diverse, with an expected heterozygosity (HE) of 0.80 and an observed heterozygosity (Ho) of 0.78. Strong structure in three subgroups based mainly on the usage and combination of parental groups was revealed by STRUCTURE software and confirmed by discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). Through molecular profiling analysis, fourteen synonyms, one homonym and one duplicate were identified. Parentage analysis confirmed 24 full parentages, as well as 33 half-kinships. In addition, 18 pedigrees were invalidated, and seven mislabeling events were identified. No compatible parent was identified for 33% of the IAC hybrids, highlighting severe genetic erosion in the IAC germplasm. The molecular characterization of the breeding hybrid bank collection contributes to our understanding of the genetic basis of the varieties, guiding the efficient utilization of available genetic diversity. Together, our results could be applied to other breeding programs and assist in the selection of parents, management of the breeding collection, and conservation of grapevine genetic resources.",

    "abstract": "The placenta is an organ with extraordinary phenotypic diversity in eutherian mammals. Recent evidence suggests that numerous human placental enhancers are evolved from lineage-specific insertions of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), yet the transcription factors (TFs) underlying their regulation remain largely elusive. Here, by first focusing on MER41, a primate-specific ERV family previously linked to placenta and innate immunity, we uncover the binding motifs of multiple crucial trophoblast TFs (GATA2/3, MSX2, GRHL2) in addition to innate immunity TFs STAT1 and IRF1. Integration of ChIP-Seq data confirms the binding of GATA2/3, MSX2 and their related factors on the majority of MER41-derived enhancers in human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Notably, MER41-derived enhancers that are constitutively active in human TSCs are distinct from those activated upon interferon stimulation, which is determined by the binding of relevant TFs and their sub-family compositions. We further demonstrate that GATA2/3 and MSX2 have prevalent binding on numerous other ERV families - indicating their broad impact on ERV-derived enhancers. Functionally, the derepression of many syncytiotrophoblast genes after disruption of MSX2 is likely to be mediated by regulatory elements derived from ERVs - suggesting ERVs are also important for mediating transcriptional repression. Overall, this study characterized the prevalent regulation of GATA2/3, MSX2 and their co-factors on ERV-derived regulatory elements in human TSCs and provided mechanistic insights into the importance of ERVs in human trophoblast regulatory network.",

Conventional humanization approaches graft the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the animal antibody onto several homologous human frameworks. This process, however, often drastically lowers stability and antigen binding, demanding iterative mutational fine-tuning to recover the original antibody properties. Here, we present Computational hUMan AntiBody design (CUMAb), a web-accessible method that starts from an experimental or model antibody structure, systematically grafts the animal CDRs on thousands of human frameworks, and uses Rosetta atomistic simulations to rank the designs by energy and structural integrity (http://CUMAb.weizmann.ac.il). CUMAb designs of five independent antibodies exhibit similar affinities to the parental animal antibody, and some designs show marked improvement in stability. Surprisingly, nonhomologous frameworks are often preferred to the highest-homology ones, and several CUMAb designs that use different human frameworks and differ by dozens of mutations are functionally equivalent. Thus, CUMAb presents a general and streamlined approach to optimizing antibody stability and expressibility while increasing humanness.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules in cells consist of functionally diverse subpopulations carrying distinct post-translational modifications (PTMs). Akin to the histone code, the tubulin code regulates a myriad of microtubule functions ranging from intracellular transport to chromosome segregation. Yet, how individual PTMs only occur on subsets of microtubules to contribute to microtubule specialization is not well understood. In particular, microtubule detyrosination, which is the removal of the C-terminal tyrosine on -tubulin subunits, marks the stable population of microtubules and modifies how microtubules interact with other microtubule-associated proteins to regulate a wide range of cellular processes. Previously, we found that, in certain cell types, only a small subpopulation of microtubules is highly enriched with the detyrosination mark ([~]30%) and that detyrosination spans most of the length of a microtubule, often adjacent to a completely tyrosinated microtubule. How the activity of a cytosolic detyrosinase, Vasohibin (VASH) leads to only a small subpopulation of highly detyrosinated microtubules is unclear. Here, using quantitative super-resolution microscopy, we visualized nascent microtubule detyrosination events in cells consisting of 1-3 detyrosinated -tubulin subunits after Nocodazole washout. Microtubule detyrosination accumulates slowly and in a disperse pattern across the microtubule length. By visualizing single molecules of VASH in live cells, we found that VASH engages with microtubules stochastically on a short time scale suggesting limited removal of tyrosine per interaction, consistent with the super-resolution results. Combining these quantitative imaging results with simulations incorporating parameters from our experiments, we propose a stochastic model for cells to establish a subset of detyrosinated microtubules via a detyrosination-stabilization feedback mechanism.",

Tissue fibrocytes interaction with CD8+ T cells and its consequences were investigated using a combination of in situ, in vitro experiments and mathematical modeling. We show that fibrocytes and CD8+ T cells are found in vicinity in distal airways and that potential interactions are more frequent in tissues from COPD patients compared to those of control subjects. Increased proximity and clusterization between CD8+ T cells and fibrocytes are associated with altered lung function. Tissular CD8+ T cells from COPD patients promote fibrocyte chemotaxis via the CXCL8-CXCR1/2 axis. Live imaging shows that CD8+ T cells establish short-term interactions with fibrocytes, that trigger CD8+ T cell proliferation in a CD54- and CD86-dependent manner, pro-inflammatory cytokines production, CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity against bronchial epithelial cells and fibrocyte immunomodulatory properties. We defined a computational model describing these intercellular interactions and calibrated the parameters based on our experimental measurements. We show the models ability to reproduce histological ex vivo characteristics, and observe an important contribution of fibrocyte-mediated CD8+ T cell proliferation in COPD development. Using the model to test therapeutic scenarios, we predict a recovery time of several years, and the failure of targeting chemotaxis or interacting processes. Altogether, our study reveals that local interactions between fibrocytes and CD8+ T cells could jeopardize the balance between protective immunity and chronic inflammation in bronchi of COPD patients.",

Cells have the capability of modeling matrix in distance, however, the biophysical mechanism is largely unknown. We investigated underlying mechanism of large collagen I (COL) fibrillary modeling by cell mechanics with designed arrays of cell clusters. By incorporating dynamic contractions, Molecular Dynamics simulations yielded highly matching isotropic outcomes with observed COL clustering in experiments from variable geometrical arrays without spatial limitation. Further designed single polygons from triangles to hexagons resulted in predicted structural assembly which showed maintained spatial balance. Cell cytoskeletal integrity (actin filaments, microtubules), actomyosin contractions, and endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels were essential for remote fiber inductions, while membrane mechanosensitive integrin and Piezo showed coordinative role in regulating the fiber assembly. The study provides new insights on cell mechanics-induced isotropic matrix modeling with dynamic large-spatial scales and the associated cellular mechanism. The assembled biomechanical scaffolds with pre-designs may lead to applications in micro-tissue engineering.

However, the genes that regulate the reproductive division of labor across all or multiple eusocial species have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis using publicly available RNA-sequencing data from four major groups of social insects. In this meta-analysis, we collected 258 pairs (queen vs. worker) of RNA-sequencing data from 34 eusocial species. The meta-analysis identified a total of 20 genes that were differentially expressed in queens or workers. Out of these, 12 genes have not previously been reported to be involved in the reproductive division of labor. Functional annotation of these 20 genes in other organisms revealed that they could be regulators of behaviors and physiological states related to the reproductive division of labor.

    "abstract": "Cellular signalling generates calcium (Ca2+) ions, which are ubiquitous secondary messengers decoded by calcium-dependent protein kinases, calcineurins, calreticulin, calmodulins (CAMs) and CAM-binding proteins. Previous studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have shown the critical roles of the CAM-BINDING PROTEIN 60 (CBP60) protein family in plant growth, stress responses and immunity. Certain CBP60 factors can regulate plant immune responses, like pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity, and synthesis of major plant immune-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). Although homologous CBP60 sequences have been identified in the plant kingdom, their function and regulation in most species remain unclear. In this paper, we specifically characterized 11 members of the CBP60 family in the agriculturally important crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Protein sequence analyses revealed that three CBP60 homologs have the closest amino acid identity to Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1, master transcription factors involved in plant immunity. Strikingly, AlphaFold deep learning-assisted prediction of protein structures highlighted close structural similarity between these tomato and Arabidopsis CBP60 homologs. Conserved domain analyses revealed that they possess CAM-binding domains and DNA-binding domains, reflecting their potential involvement in linking Ca2+ signalling and transcriptional regulation in tomato plants. In terms of their gene expression profiles under biotic (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 pathogen infection) and/or abiotic stress (warming temperatures), five tomato CBP60 genes were pathogen-responsive and temperature-sensitive, reminiscent of Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1. Overall, we present a genome-wide identification of the CBP60 gene/protein family in tomato plants, and we provide evidence on their regulation and potential function as Ca2+-sensing transcriptional regulators.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system has the extraordinary ability to produce a broad range of immunoglobulins that can bind a wide variety of antigens. During adaptive immune responses, activated B cells duplicate and undergo somatic hypermutation in their B-cell receptor (BCR) genes, resulting in clonal families of diversified B-cells that can be related back to a common ancestor. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the high-throughput characterization of B-cell repertoires, however, the accurate identification of clonally related BCR sequences remains a major challenge. In this study, we compare three different clone identification methods on both simulated and experimental data, and investigate their impact on the characterization of B-cell diversity. We find that different methods may lead to different clonal definitions, which in turn can affect the quantification of clonal diversity in repertoire data. Interestingly, we find the Shannon entropy to be overall the most robust diversity index in regard to different clonal identification. Our analysis also suggests that the traditional germline gene alignment-based method for clonal identification remains the most accurate when the complete information about the sequence is known, but that alignment-free methods may be preferred for shorter read length.

    "abstract": "The abundant macrophage population of the intestinal lamina propria turns over rapidly and is replaced by blood monocytes. The differentiation and survival of resident intestinal macrophages depends upon signals from the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R). The response of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) grown in macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been proposed as a model for the differentiation and adaptation of monocytes entering the intestinal lamina propria. We hypothesized that dysregulation of this response leads to susceptibility to chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To address this hypothesis we analyzed transcriptomic variation in MDM from affected and unaffected sib pairs/trios from 22 IBD families and 6 healthy controls. There was no overall or inter-sib distinction between affected and unaffected individuals in basal gene expression or the stereotypical time course of the response to LPS. However, the basal or LPS-inducible expression of individual genes including inflammatory cytokines and many associated with IBD susceptibility in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) varied by as much as 100-fold between subjects. Extreme independent variation in the expression of pairs of HLA-associated transcripts (HLA-B/C, HLA-A/F and HLA-DRB1/DRB5) was associated with HLA genotype providing a novel explanation for the HLA association with disease susceptibility. The relationship between single nucleotide variant (SNV) genotype and gene expression at other loci was weaker and inconsistent suggesting that much of the variation arises from the integration of multiple trans-acting effects. For example, expression of IL1B at 2 hrs of LPS treatment was significantly associated with local SNV genotype and with peak expression of IL23A at 7 hrs. By contrast, there was no evidence of association between peak IL6 mRNA at 7hrs, IL6-associated SNV genotype or IL1B at 2 hrs. Our results support the view that gene-specific dysregulation in macrophage adaptation to the intestinal milieu provides a plausible explanation for genetic susceptibility to IBD. The analysis also suggests that the molecular basis of susceptibility is unique to each individual which may contribute to variation in the precise environmental trigger, the consequent pathology and response to treatment.\n\nAuthor summaryCells of the innate immune system called macrophages are abundant in the wall of the gut, providing a first line of defense against potential pathogens. These cells must also avoid an inappropriate or excessive response to the abundant microbial population (the microbiome) of the intestine. We have previously proposed that genetic differences between individuals in macrophage adaptation to the unique environment of the intestine underlie genetic susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study we developed a model of the adaptation of macrophages and used that model to identify surprisingly extreme variation in the response amongst a cohort of affected and unaffected siblings in families with IBD. The response did not distinguish affected individuals from their unaffected siblings. Our results support the view that each individual within IBD-susceptible families carries a unique set of genetic variants of large effect that together predispose to uncontrolled gut inflammation in the face of an environmental trigger.",

    "abstract": "Vocal learning, the ability to modify vocal behavior based on experience, is a convergently evolved trait in birds and mammals. To identify genomic elements associated with vocal learning, we integrated new experiments conducted in the brain of the Egyptian fruit bat with analyses of the genomes of 222 placental mammals. We first identified an anatomically specialized region of the bat motor cortex containing direct monosynaptic projections to laryngeal motoneurons. Using wireless neural recordings of this brain region in freely vocalizing bats, we verified that single neuron activity in this region relates to vocal production. We profiled the open chromatin of this vocal-motor region, which we used to train machine learning models to identify enhancers associated with vocal learning across mammals. We found 201 proteins and 45 candidate enhancers that display convergent evolution associated with vocal learning, many of which overlapped loci associated with human speech disability. One such locus contains the neurodevelopmental transcription factors TSHZ3 and ZNF536 and multiple candidate vocal learning-associated enhancers, suggesting the co-evolution of protein and regulatory sequences underlying vocal learning.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAnalyses of bat neural activity and epigenomic data in a brain region involved in vocal behavior were used to identify proteins and regulatory elements associated with vocal learning in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Small molecule modulators are important tools to study both basic biology and the complex signaling of protein kinases. The cdc2-like kinases (CLK) are a family of four kinases that have garnered recent interest for their involvement in a diverse set of diseases such as neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, and many cancers. Targeted medicinal chemistry around a CLK inhibitor hit identified through screening of a kinase inhibitor set against a large panel of kinases allowed us to identify a potent and selective inhibitor of CLK1, 2 and 4. Here, we present the synthesis, selectivity, and potential binding site of this compound - SGC-CLK-1. We further show CLK2 has the highest binding affinity, and high CLK2 expression correlates with a lower IC50 in a screen of multiple cancer cell lines. Finally, we show that SGC-CLK-1 not only reduces serine arginine rich (SR) protein phosphorylation, but also alters SR protein and CLK2 subcellular localization in a reversible way. Therefore, we anticipate that this compound will be a valuable tool for increasing our understanding of CLKs and their targets, SR proteins, at the level of phosphorylation and subcellular localization.",

    "abstract": "Cells maintain optimal levels of lysosome degradative activity to protect against pathogens, clear waste and generate nutrients. Here we show that LRRK2, a protein that is tightly linked to Parkinsons disease, negatively regulates lysosome degradative activity in macrophages and microglia via a transcriptional mechanism. Depletion of LRRK2 and inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity enhanced lysosomal proteolytic activity and increased the expression of multiple lysosomal hydrolases. Conversely, the kinase hyperactive LRRK2 G2019S Parkinsons disease mutant suppressed lysosomal degradative activity and gene expression. We identified MiT-TFE transcription factors (TFE3, TFEB and MITF) as mediators of LRRK2-dependent control of lysosomal gene expression. LRRK2 negatively regulated the abundance and nuclear localization of these transcription factors and their depletion prevented LRRK2-dependent changes in lysosome protein levels. These discoveries define a role for LRRK2 in controlling lysosome degradative activity and support a model wherein LRRK2 hyperactivity may increase Parkinsons disease risk by suppressing lysosome degradative activity.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study defines a homeostatic mechanism that allows macrophages and microglia to match the degradative activity of their lysosomes to ongoing changes in cellular demand. It shows that the leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein suppresses lysosome degradative activity by inhibiting the expression and nuclear localization of the MiT-TFE family of transcription factors that control the expression of multiple genes that encode lysosome proteins. It further demonstrates that a Parkinsons disease mutation that hyperactivates LRRK2 kinase activity limits the degradative activity of lysosomes more strongly. These findings support a model wherein LRRK2 protects cells from excessive lysosome degradative activity and suggest that overactivation of this pathway may increase Parkinsons disease risk by limiting the degradative activity of lysosomes.",

    "abstract": "A new area of focus in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) biotechnology is the role of small (exosomes) and large (microvesicles or microparticles) extracellular vesicles (EVs). CHO cells in culture exchange large quantities of proteins and RNA through these EVs, yet the content and role of these EVs remain elusive. MicroRNAs (miRs) are central to adaptive responses to stress and more broadly to changes in culture conditions. Given that EVs are highly enriched in miRs, and that EVs release large quantities of miRs both in vivo and in vitro, EVs and their miR content likely play an important role in adaptive responses. Here we report the miRNA landscape of CHO cells and their EVs under normal culture conditions and under ammonia and osmotic stress. We show that both cells and EVs are highly enriched in five miRs (among over 600 miRs) that make up about half of their total miR content, and that these highly enriched miRs differ significantly between normal and stress culture conditions. Notable is the high enrichment in mir-92a and miR-23a under normal culture conditions, in contrast to the high enrichment in let-7 family miRs (let-7c, let-7b and let-7a) under both stress conditions. The latter suggests a preserved stress-responsive function of the let-7 miR family, one of the most highly preserved miR families across species, where among other functions, let-7 miRs regulate core oncogenes, which, depending on the biological context, may tip the balance between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. While the expected -based on their profound enrichment - important role of these highly enriched miRs remains to be dissected, our data and analysis constitute an important resource for exploring the role of miRs in cell adaptation as well as for synthetic applications.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of genome integrity is essential for cell viability and depends on complete and accurate DNA replication. However, G4/R-loops may provide significant obstacles for DNA replication, as they can cause collisions between replication fork and the transcription machinery. Hence, cells require mechanisms to counteract the presence of persistent G4/R-loops, most of which remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an involvement of the Werner helicase-interacting protein 1 (WRNIP1) in preventing DNA damage induced by G4/R-loop-associated transcription-replication conflicts. We discovered that the ubiquitin-binding domain of WRNIP1 is required to efficiently avoid pathological persistence of G4/R-loops upon replication stress. Also, we observed that G4s reside within R-loops and that WRNIP1 colocalises with these structures. Furthermore, WRNIP1 plays a role in restarting replication from transcription-induced fork stalling. More importantly, we characterized the interplay between WRNIP1 and the DNA helicase FANCJ in counteracting R-loop-dependent G4 formation in response to replication stress. Collectively, our findings propose a mechanisms whereby WRNIP1, contributing to stabilise FANCJ to G4 sites, mitigates the G4/R-loop-mediated transcription-replication conflicts and protects against DNA damage accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Plant cytokinesis, which fundamentally differs from that in animals, involves de novo assembly of a plasma membrane precursor named the cell plate. How the transition from the cell plate to a plasma membrane occurs at the end of the plant cytokinesis remains poorly understood. Here, we describe with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision, the acquisition of plasma membrane identity upon cytokinesis through the lateral patterning of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PI(4,5)P2 at the newly formed cell plate membrane. We show that during late cytokinesis, opposing polarity domains are formed along the cell plate. Exclusion of PI(4,5)P2 from the leading edge of the cell plate is controlled by SAC9, a putative phosphoinositide phosphatase. SAC9 colocalizes with MAP65-3, a key regulator of the cytokinesis, at the cell plate leading zone and regulates its function. In the sac9-3 mutant, the polar distribution of PI(4,5)P2 at the cell plate is altered, leading to de-novo recruitment of the cytokinesis apparatus and to formation of an additional, ectopic cell plate insertion site. We proposed that PI(4,5)P2 acts as a polar cue to spatially separate the expansion and maturation domains of the forming cell plate during the final steps of cytokinesis.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 acts as an hallmark to guide the final step of plant cell division.",

    "abstract": "COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide, but current therapies for COPD are only effective at treating the symptoms of the disease rather than targeting the underlying pathways that are driving the pathogenic changes. The lack of targeted therapies for COPD is in part due to a lack of knowledge about drivers of disease progression and the difficulty in building relevant and high throughput models that can recapitulate the phenotypic and transcriptomic changes associated with pathogenesis of COPD. To identify these drivers, we have developed a cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated bronchosphere assay in 384-well plate format that exhibits CSE-induced decreases in size and increase in luminal secretion of MUC5AC. Transcriptomic changes in CSE-treated bronchospheres resemble changes that occur in human smokers both with and without COPD compared to healthy groups, indicating that this model can capture human smoking signature. To identify new targets, we ran a small molecule compound deck screening with diversity in target mechanisms of action and identified hit compounds that attenuated CSE induced changes, either decreasing spheroid size or increasing secreted mucus. This work provides insight into the utility of this bronchosphere model in examining human respiratory diseases, the pathways implicated by CSE, and compounds with known mechanisms of action for therapeutic development.",

Tools to manipulate the compositionally intricate and dynamic FAs are currently limited, rendering many fundamental hypotheses untestable. Although protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been tied to the organization and dynamics of FAs, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we experimentally tune the LLPS of PXN/Paxillin, an essential scaffold protein of FAs, by utilizing light-inducible Cry2 system. In addition to nucleating FA components, light-triggered PXN LLPS potently activates integrin signaling and subsequently accelerates cell spreading. PXN favors homotypic interaction-driven LLPS in vitro. In cells, PXN condensates are associated with plasma membrane, and modulated by actomyosin contraction and client proteins of FAs. Interestingly, non-specific weak inter-molecular interactions, together with specific molecular interactions, underlie the multicomponent condensation of PXN, and are efficient to promote FA assembly and integrin signaling. Thus, our data establish an active role of PXN phase transition into a condensed membrane-associated compartment in promoting assembly/maturation of FAs.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila is a powerful model to study how lipids affect spermatogenesis. Yet, the contribution of neutral lipids, a major lipid group which resides in organelles called lipid droplets (LD), to normal sperm development is largely unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that LD are present in the testis and that loss of neutral lipid-and LD-associated genes causes subfertility; however, key regulators of testis neutral lipids and LD remain unclear. Here, we show that LD are present in early-stage somatic and germline cells within the Drosophila testis. We identified a role for triglyceride lipase brummer (bmm) in regulating testis LD, and found that whole-body loss of bmm leads to defects in sperm development. Importantly, these represent cell-autonomous roles for bmm in regulating testis LD and spermatogenesis. Because lipidomic analysis of bmm mutants revealed excess triglyceride accumulation, and spermatogenic defects in bmm mutants were rescued by genetically blocking triglyceride synthesis, our data suggest that bmm-mediated regulation of triglyceride influences sperm development. This identifies triglyceride as an important neutral lipid that contributes to Drosophila sperm development, and reveals a key role for bmm in regulating testis triglyceride levels during spermatogenesis.",

Here we turn to the dissection of one common motif, the 11nt receptor (11ntR), using quantitative analysis of RNA on a massively parallel array (RNA-MaP) to measure the binding of all single and double 11ntR mutants to GAAA and GUAA tetraloops, thereby probing the energetic architecture of the motif. While the 11ntR behaves as a motif, its cooperativity is not absolute. Instead, we uncovered a gradient from high cooperativity amongst base paired and neighboring residues to additivity between distant residues. As expected, substitutions at residues in direct contact with the GAAA tetraloop resulted in the largest decreases to binding, and energetic penalties of mutations were substantially smaller for binding to the alternate GUAA tetraloop, which lacks tertiary contacts present with the canonical GAAA tetraloop. However, we found that the energetic consequences of base partner substitutions are not, in general, simply described by base pair type or isostericity. We also found exceptions to the previously established stability-abundance relationship for 11ntR sequence variants. These findings of \"exceptions to the rule\" highlight the power of systematic high-throughput approaches to uncover novel variants for future study in addition to providing an energetic map of a functional RNA.\n\nSignificance StatementProperly folded RNAs perform essential biological processes. Many RNAs contain tertiary contact \"motifs\" whose structural and energetic properties are conserved across different RNAs. This study delves into the nature of an RNA motif. We determined the effects of mutations on the energetic properties of a common tertiary contact motif, referred to as the 11-nucleotide receptor. As deep study of the energetic architecture of this and other RNAs requires thermodynamic measurements for many sequence variants, we used RNA-MaP, a quantitative, high-throughput method, to obtain binding free energies for all single and double mutants of the motif. Our results revealed the energetic architecture of this motif and identified rare variants with unexpected properties.",

    "abstract": "Root hair (RH) cells are important for the growth and survival of seedlings. They favor plant-microbe interactions, nutrients, and water uptake. RH cells increase drastically the surface of exchange of the root system with the surrounding environment. To be able to invade the soil, RH cells have to penetrate a dense and porous medium exhibiting a variety of physical properties. The soils physical properties, such as mechanical resistance, impact the growth and survival of plants. Consequently, studying the effect of soil resistance on the growth of RH is essential to improve our understanding of plant growth. Here we investigate the effect of the mechanical resistance of the culture medium on RH-physical and phenotypical parameters such as length, time, and speed of growth. We also analyze the impact of the environment on the positioning, and movement of the nucleus inside the growing cells. To do so, Arabidopsis Thaliana seedlings were cultured in a custom-made microfluidic-like system, in solid media with agar concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 1.25%. We show that the time of growth of RH cells is independent of the mechanical resistance of the surrounding environment, while the RH speed decreases when the mechanical resistance increases. As a consequence, the RH cells are shorter in stiffer environments. Moreover, we show that the speed of the nucleus adapts to the mechanical resistance of the environment and follows the same trend as the average speed of the RH tip. Eventually, during RH growth, the nucleus-to-tip distance was found to decrease when the stiffness of the environment was increased, indicating mechanotransduction from the cell surface to the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "The root microbiome structure ensures optimal plant-host health and fitness, and it is, at least in part, defined by the plant genotype. It is well-documented that root-secreted amino acids promote microbial chemotaxis and growth in the rhizosphere. However, whether the plant-mediated re-uptake of amino acids contributes to maintaining optimal levels of amino acids in the root exudates, and in turn, microbial growth and metabolism, remains to be established. Here we show that LHT1, an amino acid inward transporter expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, limits the growth of the plant-growth-promoting bacteria Pseudomonas simiae WCS417r (Ps WCS417r). Amino acid profiling of the lht1 mutant root exudates showed increased levels of glutamine, among other amino acids. Interestingly, lht1 exudates or Gln-supplemented wild-type exudates enhance Ps WCS417r growth. However, despite promoting bacterial growth and robust root colonization, lht1 exudates and Gln-supplemented wild-type exudates inhibited plant growth in a Ps WCS417r-dependent manner. Transcriptional analysis of defense and growth marker genes revealed that plant growth inhibition was not linked to the elicitation of plant defense, but likely to the impact of Ps WCS417r amino acids metabolism on auxin signaling. These data suggest that an excess of amino acids in the rhizosphere impacts Ps WCS417r metabolism which in turn inhibits plant growth. Together, these results unveil that LHT1 regulates the amino acid-mediated interaction between plants and Ps WCS417r and suggest a complex relationship between root-exuded amino acids, root colonization by beneficial bacteria, bacterial metabolism, and plant growth promotion.",

    "abstract": "To better incentivize the collection of plastic wastes, new chemical transformations must be developed that add value to plastic deconstruction products. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a common plastic whose deconstruction through chemical or biological means has received much attention. However, a limited number of alternative products have been formed from PET deconstruction, and only a small share could serve as building blocks for alternative materials or therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate the production of useful mono-amine and diamine building blocks from known PET deconstruction products. We achieve this by designing one-pot biocatalytic transformations that are informed by the substrate specificity of an {omega}-transaminase and diverse carboxylic acid reductases (CAR) towards PET deconstruction products. We first establish that an {omega}-transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum (cvTA) can efficiently catalyze amine transfer to potential PET-derived aldehydes to form the mono-amine para-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid (pAMBA) or the diamine para-xylylenediamine (pXYL). We then identified CAR orthologs that could perform the bifunctional reduction of TPA to terephthalaldehyde (TPAL) or the reduction of mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) to its corresponding aldehyde. After characterizing 17 CARs in vitro, we show that the CAR from Segniliparus rotundus (srCAR) had the highest observed activity on TPA. Given these newly elucidated substrate specificity results, we designed modular enzyme cascades based on coupling srCAR and cvTA in one-pot with enzymatic co-factor regeneration. When we supply TPA, we achieve a 69 {+/-} 1% yield of pXYL, which is useful as a building block for materials. When we instead supply MHET and subsequently perform base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis, we achieve 70 {+/-} 8% yield of pAMBA, which is useful for therapeutic applications and as a pharmaceutical building block. This work expands the breadth of products derived from PET deconstruction and lays the groundwork for eventual valorization of waste PET to higher-value chemicals and materials.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=117 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/520786v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bb7386org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19d8c55org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68569eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ed398_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Resistance to multiple drugs is one of the significant barriers in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Knowledge of mechanisms of resistance is important to design effective treatment strategies. While mutations in genes coding for drug targets are thought to be the primary source of drug resistance, absence of mutations in these genes in many clinical strains suggests additional mechanisms of resistance. In this study, we employ adaptive laboratory evolution of Mycobacterium smegmatis to understand alternate mechanisms of drug resistance to norfloxacin, a fluoroquinolone (FQ). Results show that, in addition to fluoroquinolones, the evolved strain, Norr, is resistant to first-line drugs, rifampicin and isoniazid, and a second-line drug (amikacin), exhibiting extreme drug resistance phenotype. However, mutations were absent in any of the drug target genes. Drug uptake studies revealed that resistance is an attribute of decreased intracellular accumulation, primarily due to increased efflux. Further, drug transport kinetics demonstrate the involvement of efflux mediated resistance, which was found to be reversed in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs). Gene transcript analysis suggests differential upregulation of multiple efflux pumps across the genome of the mutant. Overexpression of one of the upregulated efflux pumps Msmeg_5659-5661, partially explains the XDR phenotype of the mutant, while also suggesting that the contribution of other efflux pumps is significant. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Norr reveals that a mutation in soxR, a transcriptional regulator, could be responsible for the upregulation of the Msmeg_5659-5661 efflux pump by direct regulation, and other efflux pumps via indirect regulation. Thus, the present work demonstrates that high resistance to multiple drugs can arise even when the Mycobacterium was subjected to a single selection pressure. Further, alterations in drug transport is an important mechanism that leads to resistance to multiple drugs simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Usage of Virtual reality (VR) has been growing in many fields of research and therapy thanks to its immersive and gamified nature. Detection of the subjective experience of the users is thus essential for effective personalization of content. Eye-tracking (ET) data and specifically gaze, in two-dimensional tasks has been linked to value-based choices and emotional states. Therefore, here we aimed to develop a method for passive identification of subjective preferences based on ET data collected during a VR experience. For this purpose, we developed a naturalistic dynamic VR task where participants searched and looked at complex objects of pets and control shapes that appeared in pre-defined locations in random order. At the end of the task, participants ranked their preference, valence, and arousal of the items they saw during the task. ET data was recorded using a built-in binocular eye-tracker within the VR headset. We found that the median distance of gaze from the center of objects and the median gaze scan speed showed a significant interaction with object type (pets/shapes), as well as a significant positive relation to preference and valence rankings of pets. Our results suggest that ET could be used as a passive biomarker for detecting individual preferences and pleasantness, and in the future may enable successful personalization of VR content in real time for various applications.",

    "abstract": "Oomycetes were recently discovered as natural pathogens of Caenorhabditis elegans and pathogen recognition alone was shown to be sufficient to activate a protective transcriptional program in the host characterised by the expression of multiple chitinase-like (chil) genes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying oomycete recognition in animals remain fully unknown. We performed here a forward genetic screen to uncover regulators of chil gene induction and found several independent loss-of-function alleles of old-1 and flor-1, which encode receptor tyrosine kinases belonging to the C. elegans-specific KIN-16 family. We present evidence that OLD-1 is an active kinase mounting the immune response, and FLOR-1 a pseudokinase that is also required for the response and regulates the distribution of OLD-1 at the epidermal membrane. Interestingly, the old-1 locus is adjacent to the chil genes in the nematode genome, thereby revealing a genetic cluster important for oomycete-resistance. Furthermore, we identify the VAB-3/PAX-6 transcription factor known for its role in visual system development to regulate old-1 expression, and consequently the spatial pattern of the response to oomycete recognition. Taken together, our study reveals both conserved and species-specific factors shaping the response to oomycete recognition.",

    "abstract": "CD8 memory T cells are generated during primary infection with intracellular pathogens, such as viruses. These cells play an important role in the protection of the host upon re-infection with the same pathogen. In this study, we compare CD8 memory T cell receptor (TCR) BV repertoires directly ex vivo for two common human viruses, influenza A virus (IAV), an RNA virus that frequently re-infects due to a high rate of genetic mutation, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a DNA virus, which persists in B cells for life, in the 95% of people that become infected. In cross- sectional and longitudinal studies of EBV seropositive, HLA-A2+, young (18-22 years), middle age (25-59 years), and older (>60 years) donors, we demonstrate that CD8 memory TCR repertoires to three immunodominant epitopes, known to have cross-reactive responses, IAV- M158-66 (M1), EBV-BMLF1280-288 (BM), and EBV-BRLF109-117 (BR) co-evolve as individuals age. Cross-sectional studies showed that IAV-M1- and both EBV-specific repertoires narrowed their TRBV usage with increasing age manifesting to different degrees for each epitope. In fact, narrowing of EBV-BM and EBV-BR-specific TRBV usage correlated with increasing age. IAV- M1-specific TRBV usage was significantly narrowed by middle-age. There was evidence that TRBV usage was changing with increasing age. For instance, IAV-M1-specific dominant BV19 usage appeared to become bimodal showing either high or low frequency of usage in the older age group, while BV30 usage frequency directly correlated with age. For the EBV epitope-specific responses there was preferential usage of particular TRBV and changes in the hierarchy of BV family usage in the different age groups. There appeared to be focusing of the TRBV repertoire by all 3 epitopes to three common BV in the older donors, which would be consistent with retention of crossreactive TCR suggesting co-evolution. Longitudinal studies tracking two donors over 14- 15 years (middle age to older) showed that there were continuous modulations in the TCR repertoire of IAV-M1, EBV-BM and EBV-BR-specific responses over time. There was evidence that acute IAV infection could contribute to these changes in TCR repertoire. This could be occurring by the TCR cross-reactivity that is known to exist between these 3 epitopes, and which appeared to be enhanced during acute IAV infection based on increased usage of common shared TRBV. These studies suggest that virus-specific TCR repertoires change over time as individuals age leading to narrowing of the repertoire favoring retention of potentially crossreactive TCR.",

While cells could be initially infected by both viruses, the rg224RSV-{Delta}G virus exhibited severely impaired localised virus transmission in the multiple cycle infection assay. Collectively these data provide evidence that the F and G proteins interact within the envelope of RSV particles, and suggests that this interaction may promote virus transmission.

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 activity has intensified globally since 2021, replacing the dominant clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 virus. H5N1 viruses have spread rapidly to four continents, causing increasing reports of mass mortality in wild birds and poultry. The ecological and virological properties required for future mitigation strategies are unclear. Using epidemiological, spatial and genomic approaches, we demonstrate changes in the source of resurgent H5 HPAI and reveal significant shifts in virus ecology and evolution. Outbreak data indicates key resurgent events in 2016/17 and 2020/21 that contributed to the panzootic spread of H5N1 in 2021/22, including an increase in virus diffusion velocity and persistence in wild birds. Genomic analysis reveals that the 2016/17 epizootics originated in Asia, where HPAI H5 reservoirs are documented as persistent. However, in 2020/21, 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses emerged in domestic poultry in Africa, featuring several novel mutations altering the HA structure, receptor binding, and antigenicity. The new H5N1 virus emerged from H5N8 through reassortment in wild birds along the Adriatic flyway around the Mediterranean Sea. It was characterized by extensive reassortment with low pathogenic avian influenza in domestic and wild birds as it spread globally. In contrast, earlier outbreaks of H5N8 were caused by a more stable genetic constellation, highlighting dynamic changes in HPAI H5 genomic evolution. These results suggest a shift in the epicenter of HPAI H5 beyond Asia to new regions in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North and South America. The persistence of HPAI H5 with resurgence potential in domestic birds indicates that elimination strategies remain a high priority.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn increasing burden of invasive group A streptococcal infections is reported in multiple countries, notably England, where scarlet fever cases are also abundant. In England, increased scarlet fever and invasive infections have been associated with emergence of a sublineage of emm1 Streptococcus pyogenes that expresses increased SpeA scarlet fever erythrogenic toxin. Wider surveillance for toxigenic Streptococcus pyogenes lineage M1UK is much needed however, to date, lineage assignment has required genome sequencing limiting surveillance to those centres with access to such facilities.\n\nMethodsTo circumvent the requirement for genome sequencing, an allele-specific PCR was developed to distinguish M1UK from other emm1 strains. Additional PCR assays were developed to distinguish M1UK from two intermediate lineages that were detected previously. The assay was evaluated using DNA from genome-sequenced upper respiratory tract emm1 S. pyogenes strains and a further set of 16 genome-sequenced invasive S. pyogenes isolates that included the two intermediate lineages. The assay was then applied to DNA from all 305 invasive emm1 isolates that had been submitted to the reference laboratory in the one pear period Jan 1-Dec 31 2020, in order to assign lineage.\n\nResultsThe allele specific PCR was 100% accurate when compared with genome sequencing, correctly identifying M1UK, two intermediate sublineages, and other emm1 strains. The assay demonstrated the M1UK lineage to be dominant among emm1 invasive isolates in England, representing 278/305 (91%) of invasive emm1 isolates by end of 2020.\n\nImplicationsEmm1 S. pyogenes have a prominent role in invasive infections; any emm1 lineage that demonstrates enhanced fitness within the population is of public health concern. The allele specific PCR provides a readily available method to subtype emm1 isolates and does not require access to complex sequencing facilities. The data confirm that the M1UK lineage has persisted and further expanded in England underlining the importance of wider global surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disorder causing abnormal vessel formation and characterized by autosomal dominant transmission. The associated considerable variability in symptoms and clinical severity complicate the management of the disease. In clinical routine, 3 main genes, ACVRL1 (also known as ALK1), ENG and SMAD4 are screened for pathogenic variants at the origin of HHT. About 80% of HHT cases are caused by pathogenic coding variants in ACVRL1 and ENG. However, at least 15% remain with no molecular explanations in the 3 main genes. We here report the identification of 2 never reported variants, c.-79C>T and c.-68G>A, in the 5UTR of ENG in 2 unrelated HHT patients. These 2 variants are predicted to create upstream AUGs (uAUGs) in the 5UTR, which are in frame with a stop codon located within the CoDing Sequence (CDS), thus generating Overlapping upstream Open reading frames (uoORFs). In other cases, uAUGs can lead to fully upstream ORFs (uORFs) when associated with stop codons located within the 5UTR or to elongated CDS (eCDS) when in frame with the CDS and associated with the main stop codon.\n\nIn order to assess the pathogenicity of these ENG variants, we performed in vitro functional assays based on the expression of wild-type and mutant constructs in human cells. We found that these 5UTR ENG variants were associated with a decrease of protein levels in HeLa and HUVEC cells. They were also associated with a decreased ability to activate BMP9-stimulated ALK1 receptor in a BMP-response element (BRE) assay. This assay is a mandatory element before providing a definitive molecular diagnosis and has been so far applied only on coding ENG variants. We applied the same experimental workflow on 3 additional uoORF-creating variants (c.-142A>T, c.-127C>T and c.-10C>T) and one eCDS-creating variant (c.-9G>A) in the 5UTR of ENG previously reported in HHT patients. We found that all the analysed uoORF-creating variants alter endoglin levels and function. A comparison of our experimental results with patients clinical characteristics suggests that uoORF-creating variants leading to ENG protein levels [&le;] 40% in vitro would be associated with HHT. Additional experiments relying on an artificial deletion in our mutated constructs show that created uAUGs predicted to create uoORFs are able to initiate the translation indicating that the associated effect is likely caused by an alteration of the translation mechanism.\n\nOverall, we here identified two never reported 5UTR ENG variations in HHT patients and shed new lights on the role of upstream ORFs on ENG regulation. Our findings contribute to the amelioration of molecular diagnosis in HHT.",

However, no study exists on the molecular properties of cell types within human leptomeninges. Here, we provide the first single nuclei profiling of dissected postmortem leptomeninges from aged individuals. We detect diverse cell types, including unique meningeal endothelial, mural, and fibroblast subtypes. For immune cells, we show that most T cells express CD8 and bear characteristics of tissue-resident memory T cells. We also identify distinct subtypes of border-associated macrophages (BAMs) that display differential gene expressions from microglia and express risk genes for Alzheimers Disease (AD), as nominated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We discover cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes in individuals with Alzheimers dementia, particularly in fibroblasts and BAMs. Indeed, when cultured, leptomeningeal cells display the signature of ex vivo AD fibroblasts upon amyloid-{beta} treatment. We further explore ligand-receptor interactions within the leptomeningeal niche and computationally infer intercellular communications in AD. Thus, our study establishes a molecular map of human leptomeningeal cell types, providing significant insight into the border immune and fibrotic responses in AD.",

Genomic sequence data for this species is limited. Here, we report a high-quality assembly and annotation of the D. eleginoides genome, generated using a combination of Illumina, PacBio and Omni-C sequencing technologies. To aid the genome annotation, the transcriptome derived from a variety of toothfish tissues was also generated using both short and long read sequencing methods. The final genome assembly was 797.8 Mb with a N50 scaffold length of 3.5 Mb. Approximately 31.7% of the genome consisted of repetitive elements. A total of 35,543 putative protein-coding regions were identified, of which 50% have been functionally annotated. Transcriptomics analysis showed that approximately 64% of the predicted genes (22,617 genes) were found to be expressed in the tissues sampled. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that the anti-freeze glycoprotein (AFGP) locus of D. eleginoides does not contain any AFGP proteins compared to the same locus in the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni). This is in agreement with previously published results looking at hybridization signals and confirms that Patagonian toothfish do not possess AFGP coding sequences in their genome. The high-quality genome assembly of the Patagonian toothfish will provide a valuable genetic resource for ecological and evolutionary studies on this and other closely related species.",

Here, in a comprehensive radiogenomics study of 358 GBMs, we investigated the associations between the imaging and spatial characteristics of the tumors with their cancer gene mutation status, as well as with the cross-sectionally inferred likely order of mutational events. We show that cross-validated machine learning analysis of multi-parametric MRI scans results in distinctive in vivo imaging signatures of several mutations, which are relatively more distinctive in homogeneous tumors which harbor only one of these mutations. These imaging signatures offer mechanistic insights into how various mutations influence the phenotype of the tumor and its surrounding infiltrated brain tissue via neovascularization and vascular leakage, increased cell density, invasion and migration, and other characteristics captured by respective imaging features. Furthermore, we found that spatial location and tumor distribution vary, depending on the GBMs molecular characteristics. Finally, distinct imaging and spatial characteristics were associated with cross-sectionally estimated evolutionary trajectories of the tumors. Collectively, our study establishes a panel of in vivo and clinically accessible imaging-AI biomarkers of GBM that reflect their molecular composition and oncogenic drivers.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing combined with single-cell sequencing enables the tracing of the history of cell divisions, or cellular lineage, in tissues and whole organisms. While standard phylogenetic approaches may be applied to reconstruct cellular lineage trees from this data, the unique features of the CRISPR-Cas9 editing process motivate the development of specialized models that describe the evolution of CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutations. Here, we introduce the star homoplasy model, a novel evolutionary model that constrains a phylogenetic character to mutate at most once along a lineage, capturing the non-modifiability property of CRISPR-Cas9 mutations. We derive a combinatorial characterization of star homoplasy phylogenies by identifying a relationship between the star homoplasy model and the binary perfect phylogeny model. We use this characterization to develop an algorithm, Startle (Star tree lineage estimator), that computes a maximum parsimony star homoplasy phylogeny. We demonstrate that Startle infers more accurate phylogenies on simulated CRISPR-based lineage tracing data compared to existing methods; particularly on data with high amounts of dropout and homoplasy. Startle also infers more parsimonious phylogenies with fewer metastatic migrations on a lineage tracing dataset from mouse metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nCode availabilitySoftware is available at https://github.com/raphael-group/startle",

    "abstract": "BK channels are high-conductance potassium channels that are activated by voltage and Ca2+. The pore-forming -subunits form homotetramers including a membrane-spanning domain and a cytosolic domain with a tandem of RCK-like domains (RCK1 and RCK2) per subunit. The eight RCKs compose high affinity Ca2+-binding sites that drive channel activation. Full-length Cryo-EM structures revealed intersubunit interactions between the RCK domains. Asparagine 449 (N449, human BK channel) is located at the RCK1 domain and coordinates Ca2+ in the RCK2 of the adjacent subunit. In addition, two Arginines (R786 and R790) of one RCK2 and Glutamate 955 of the adjacent subunit constitute an additional interaction interface. Functional studies on these residues showed that these two interfaces are crucial in Ca2+ sensitivity. To detect structural rearrangements induced by Ca2+ during channel activation, we took advantage of the photoactivatable unnatural amino acid p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (BzF). Functional channels were obtained with this amino acid inserted at 11 positions. N449 and R786 positions (N449BzF and R786BzF respectively). UV-induced photocrosslinking led to Ca2+ dependent and voltage-independent effects in both mutants. N449BzF showed a steady-state current reduction at saturating Ca2+ concentrations. Our data shows that this effect mainly relies on full occupancy of the RCK1 Ca2+ binding site, since mutation of this site abolished the effect. The R786BzF construct showed a substantial potentiation of the current in the absence of Ca2+. In this case, photocrosslinking seems to favor the activation of the channel by voltage. Overall, these results suggest mobile interfaces between RCK domains are key to BK channel activation.",

    "abstract": "Otopetrin proteins (OTOPs) form proton-selective ion channels that are expressed in diverse cell types where they may mediate detection of acids or regulation of pH. In vertebrates there are three family members: OTOP1 is required for formation of otoconia in the vesibular system and it forms the receptor for sour taste, while the functions of OTOP2, and OTOP3 are not yet known. Importantly, the gating mechanisms of any of the OTOP channels are not well-understood, and until recently, it was not even known if the channels were gated. Here we show that Zn2+, as well as other transition metals including copper (Cu2+), potently activate murine OTOP3. Zn2+ pre-exposure increases the magnitude of OTOP3 currents to a subsequent acid stimulus by as much as 10-fold. In contrast, OTOP2 currents are insensitive to potentiation by Zn2+. Swapping the extracellular tm 11-12 linker between OTOP3 and OTOP2 was sufficient to eliminate Zn2+ potentiation of OTOP3 and confer Zn2+ potentiation on OTOP2. We also show that H531 within the tm 11-12 linker is essential for potentiation of OTOP3 by Zn2+, likely by forming part of its binding site. Kinetic modeling of the data is consistent with Zn2+ stabilizing the open state of the channel, possibly competing with H+ for activation of the channels. These results establish the tm 11-12 linker as part of the gating apparatus of OTOP channels and a target for drug discovery. Zinc is an essential micronutrient and its regulation of OTOP channels will undoubtedly have important physiological sequelae.\n\nSignificance StatementA family of proton-activated H+ ion channels was recently identified that includes the sour receptor OTOP1. Here we show that members of the OTOP channel family are differentially sensitive to Zn2+, which strongly activates OTOP3 but not OTOP2. By studying chimeric channels, we identify structural elements in the extracellular linker between transmembrane domains 11-12 that are necessary and sufficient for Zn2+ activation of OTOP channels. In addition to the taste system, OTOP channels play important roles in biomineralization in both vertebrate and invertebrates and are expressed in the digestive tract where their expression is a predictor of cancer prognosis. Our identification of the tm 11-12 linker as part of the gating apparatus makes it a promising target for pharmaceutical discovery.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas effector complexes enable the defense against foreign nucleic acids and have recently been exploited as molecular tools for precise genome editing at a target locus. To bind and cleave their target, the CRISPR-Cas effectors first have to interrogate the entire genome for the presence of a matching sequence. Matching is achieved by base-pairing between the crRNA of the complexes and the DNA target strand such that an R-loop is formed. R-loop formation starts at a specific PAM motif and progresses reversibly in single base-pair steps until mismatches stop further progression or until the full target is recognized and destroyed. The reversible nature of this process entails that even a fully matching target should only become recognized with a low probability per target encounter. The details of this process, which directly affect the effectiveness of the target search, remain unresolved.\n\nHere we dissect the target search process of the Type I CRISPR-Cas complex Cascade by simultaneously monitoring DNA binding and R-loop formation by the complex. We directly quantify the low target recognition probabilities and show that they increase with increasing negative supercoiling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cascade uses a combination of three-dimensional and limited one-dimensional diffusion along the DNA contour for its target search. The latter allows for rapidly scanning the PAM sequences in a given region and, importantly, significantly increasing the overall efficiency of the target search by repeatedly revisiting the sites. Overall we show that target search and target recognition are tightly linked and that DNA supercoiling and limited 1D diffusion need to be considered when understanding target recognition and target search by CRISPR-Cas enzymes and engineering more efficient and precise variants.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites with limited proteomes that heavily rely on the cell molecular machinery for their multiplication and spread. Plant viruses frequently cause symptoms through interference with host developmental programs. Despite the agricultural relevance of symptom development in virus-infected crops, the molecular mechanisms underlying these viral effects remain elusive. Here, we show that the symptoms triggered by tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) depend on the physical interaction between the host-mimicking domain of a virus-encoded protein, C4, and a plant-specific family of RCC1-like domain-containing (RLD) proteins. C4 outcompetes endogenous interactors of RLDs, disrupting RLD function in the regulation of endomembrane trafficking and polar auxin transport, ultimately leading to the developmental alterations recognized as symptoms of the viral infection. Importantly, symptoms do not have a detectable effect on the performance of the virus in the plant host, but they serve as attractants for the viral insect vector, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, hence promoting pathogen spread. Our work uncovers the molecular underpinnings of the viral manipulation that leads to symptom development in the TYLCV-tomato pathosystem, and suggests that symptoms have evolved as a strategy to promote viral transmission by the insect vector. Given that most plant viruses are insect-transmitted, the principles described here might have broad applicability to crop-virus interactions.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry bioactive molecules associated with various biological processes, including miRNAs. In both Huntingtons disease (HD) models and human samples, altered expression of miRNAs involved in synapse regulation were reported. Recently, the use of EV cargo to reverse phenotypic alterations in disease models with synaptopathy as the end-result of the pathophysiological cascade has become an interesting possibility. Here, we assessed the contribution of EVs to GABAergic synaptic alterations using a human HD model and studied the miRNA content of isolated EVs. After differentiating HD human induced-pluripotent stem cells into electrophysiologically active striatal-like GABAergic neurons, we found that HD-derived neurons displayed reduced density of inhibitory synapse markers and of GABA receptor-mediated ionotropic signaling. Treatment with EVs secreted by control (CTR) fibroblasts reversed the deficits in GABAergic synaptic transmission and increased the density of inhibitory synapses on HD-neuron cultures, while EVs from HD-derived fibroblasts had the opposite effects on CTR-neurons.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aggressive interstitial lung disease associated with progressive and irreversible deterioration of respiratory functions that lacks curative therapies. Despite IPF being associated with a dysregulated immune response, current antifibrotics aim only at limiting fibroproliferation. We show here that the P2RX7/IL-18/IFNG axis is downregulated in IPF patients and that P2RX7 has immunoregulatory functions. Using our positive modulator of P2RX7, we show that activation of the P2RX7/IL-18 axis in immune cells limits lung fibrosis progression in a mouse model by favoring an anti-fibrotic immune environment, with notably an enhanced IL-18-dependent IFN-{gamma} production by lung T cells leading to a decreased production of IL-17 and TGF{beta}. Overall, we show the ability of the immune system to limit lung fibrosis progression by targeting the immunomodulator P2RX7. Hence, treatment with a small activator of P2RX7 may represent a promising strategy for patients with lung fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and fungi poses a threat for healthcare worldwide. The development of novel effective small molecule therapeutic strategies in this space has remained challenging. An orthogonal approach, therefore, is to explore biomaterials with physical modes of action which have the potential to generate antimicrobial activity and in some cases even prevent antimicrobial resistance. Here, to this effect, we describe an approach for forming silk-based films that contain embedded selenium nanoparticles. We show that these materials exhibit both antibacterial and antifungal properties while crucially also remaining highly biocompatible and non-cytotoxic towards mammalian cells. By incorporating the nanoparticles into silk films, the protein scaffold acts in a two-fold manner; it protects the mammalian cells from the cytotoxic effects of the bare nanoparticles, while also providing a template for bacterial and fungal eradication. A range of hybrid inorganic/organic films were produced and an optimum concentration was found, which allowed for both high bacterial and fungal death while also exhibiting low mammalian cell cytotoxicity. Such films can thus pave the way for next generation antimicrobial materials for applications such as wound healing and as agents against topical infections, with the added benefit that bacteria and fungi are unlikely to develop antimicrobial resistance to these hybrid materials.",

Replete workers swell the crop and gaster to store liquid food, which can be accessed by other colony members through trophallaxis. This storage ability, known as repletism, has independently evolved across several ant lineages, but the temporal history of this trait has not yet been investigated. Here, we describe the first fossil replete in the extinct species Leptomyrmex neotropicus Baroni Urbani, 1980 preserved in Miocene-age Dominican amber. Together with new evidence of repletism in L. neotropicus extant sister species, L. relictus Boudinot et al., 2016, we reconstruct the pattern of acquisition and descent in this storage-linked trait. Our ancestral state reconstruction suggests that Leptomyrmex acquired replete workers in the Eocene and may therefore represent the earliest instance of so-called \"honeypot\" ants among all known ants, both living and extinct.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the evolutionary significance of ectoparasites in natural communities is limited by a paucity of information concerning the mechanisms and heritability of resistance to this ubiquitous and diverse assemblage of organisms. Here, we report the results of artificial selection for increasing ectoparasite resistance in replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster derived from a field-fresh population. Resistance, as ability to avoid infestation by naturally occurring Gamasodes queenslandicus mites, increased significantly in response to selection, and realized heritability (s.e.) was estimated to be 0.11 (0.0090). Ability to deploy energetically expensive bursts of flight from the substrate was a main mechanism of resistance that responded to selection, aligning with previously documented metabolic costs of fly behavioral defenses. Host body size, which affects parasitism rate in some fly-mite systems, was not shifted by selection. In contrast, resistant lines expressed significant reductions in larva-to-adult survivorship with increasing toxic (ammonia) stress, identifying an environmentally modulated pre-adult cost of resistance. Flies resistant to G. queenslandicus were also more resistant to a different mite, Macrocheles subbadius, suggesting that we documented genetic variation and a pleiotropic cost of broad-spectrum behavioral immunity against ectoparasites. This study demonstrates significant evolutionary potential of an ecologically important trait.",

We study here the properties of PSDs and in particular how they can be generated by polymers. We show that increasing the number of cross-linkers generate a polymer condensation, preventing the access of diffusing molecules. To investigate how the PSDs restrict the motion of diffusing molecules, we estimate the mean residence and first escaping times. Finally, by computing the mean square displacement of single particle trajectories, we can reconstruct the properties of PSDs in term of a continuum range of anomalous exponents. To conclude, PSDs can result from a condensed chromatin, where the number of cross-linkers control the molecular access.",

    "abstract": "The present study expands the versatility of cationic poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) copolymers as a PEG-free platform for gene delivery to immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages. Several block copolymers are developed by varying non-ionic hydrophilic blocks (poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (pMeOx) or poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (pEtOx), cationic blocks, and an optional hydrophobic block (poly(2-isopropyl-2-oxazoline) (iPrOx). The cationic blocks are produced by side chain modification of 2-methoxy-carboxyethyl-2-oxazoline (MestOx) block precursor with diethylenetriamine (DET) or tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN). For the attachment of a targeting ligand, mannose, we employed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry methods. Of the two cationic side chains, polyplexes made with DET-containing copolymers transfect macrophages significantly better than those made with TREN-based copolymer. Likewise, non-targeted pEtOx-based diblock copolymer is more active in cell transfection than pMeOx-based copolymer. The triblock copolymer with hydrophobic block iPrOx performs poorly compared to the diblock copolymer which lacks this additional block. Surprisingly, attachment of a mannose ligand to either of these copolymers is inhibitory for transfection. Despite similarities in size and design, mannosylated polyplexes result in lower cell internalization compared to non-mannosylated polyplexes. Thus, PEG-free, non-targeted DET- and pEtOx-based diblock copolymer outperforms other studied structures in the transfection of macrophages and displays transfection levels comparable to GeneJuice, a commercial non-lipid transfection reagent.",

    "abstract": "Somatic loss-of-function mutations of the dioxygenase Ten-eleven translocation-2 (TET2) occur frequently in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These common hematopoietic disorders can be recapitulated in mouse models. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the deficiency in TET2 promotes these disorders remain largely unknown. Here we show that the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is activated to mediate the effect of TET2 deficiency in leukemogenesis in mouse models. DNA damage arising in Tet2-deficient hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) leads to activation of the cGAS-STING pathway which in turn induces the development of CH and myeloid transformation. Notably, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of STING suppresses Tet2 mutation-induced aberrant myelopoiesis. In patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, STING inhibition specifically attenuates the proliferation of leukemia cells from TET2-mutated individuals. These observations suggest that the hematopoietic transformation associated with TET2 mutations is powered through sterile inflammation dependent on the activated cGAS-STING pathway, and that STING may represent a potential target for intervention of relevant hematopoietic malignancies.\n\nKey pointsO_LITet2 deficiency leads to DNA damage which in turn activates the cGAS-STING pathway to induce an inflammatory response\nC_LIO_LIBlocking STING in TET2-mutated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells suppresses clonal hematopoiesis in mice and leukemogenesis in patient-derived xenograft models\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammation, and goblet cell hyperplasia. Both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, including IFN-{gamma}, IL-4, and IL-13 have been shown to induce asthma; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We observed a significant increase in the expression of IL-31RA, but not its cognate ligand IL-31 during house dust mite- and Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen-induced allergic asthma. In support of this, IFN-{gamma} and Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, upregulated IL-31RA but not IL-31 in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC). Importantly, the loss of IL-31RA attenuated AHR but had no effects on inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in allergic asthma or mice treated with IL-13 or IFN{gamma}. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that IL-31RA functions as a positive regulator of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (CHRM3) expression and calcium signaling involved in the contractility of ASMC. Together, these results identified a novel role for IL-31RA in ASMC contractility and AHR distinct from airway inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in asthma.\n\nSummaryThe study identified an important role for the IL-31RA-CHRM3 axis in inducing airway hyperresponsiveness with limited changes in inflammation in allergic asthma.

    "abstract": "1Microbial communities are increasingly recognized as key drivers in animal health, agricultural productivity, industrial operations, and ecological systems. The abundance of chemical interactions in these complex communities, however, can complicate or evade experimental studies, which hinders basic understanding and limits efforts to rationally design communities for applications in the aforementioned fields. Numerous computational approaches have been proposed to deduce these metabolic interactions - notably including flux balance analysis (FBA) and systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) - yet, these methods either fail to capture the dynamic phenotype expression of community members or lack the abstractions required to fit or explain the diverse experimental omics data that can be acquired today.\n\nWe therefore developed a dynamic model (CommPhitting) that deduces phenotype abundances and growth kinetics for each community member, concurrent with metabolic concentrations, by coupling flux profiles for each phenotype with experimental growth and -omics data of the community. These data are captured as variables and coefficients within a mixed integer linear optimization problem (MILP) designed to represent the associated biological processes. This problem finds the globally optimized fit to all experimental data of a trial, thereby most accurately computing aspects of the community: (1) species and phenotype abundances over time; (2) a linearized growth kinetic constant for each phenotype; and (3) metabolite concentrations over time. We exemplify CommPhitting by applying it to study batch growth of an idealized two-member community of the model organisms (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas flourescens) that exhibits cross-feeding in maltose media. Measurements of this community from our accompanying experimental studies - including total biomass, species biomass, and metabolite abundances over time - were parameterized into a CommPhitting simulation. The resultant kinetics constants and biomass proportions for each member phenotype would be difficult to ascertain experimentally, yet are important for understanding community responses to environmental perturbations and therefore engineering applications: e.g. for bioproduction. We believe that CommPhitting - which is generalized for a diversity of data types and formats, and is further available and amply documented as a Python API - will augment basic understanding of microbial communities and will accelerate the engineering of synthetic communities for diverse applications in medicine, agriculture, industry, and ecology.",

    "abstract": "Drugs enhancing the availability of noradrenaline are gaining prominence in the therapy of chronic neuropathic pain. However, underlying mechanisms are not well understood, and research has thus far focused on 2-adrenergic receptors and neuronal excitability. Adrenergic receptors are also expressed on glial cells, but their roles toward antinociception are not well deciphered. This study addresses the contribution of {beta}2-adrenergic receptors ({beta}2-ARs) to the therapeutic modulation of neuropathic pain in mice. We report that selective activation of {beta}2-ARs with Formoterol inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling in microglia ex-vivo and nerve injury-induced structural remodeling and functional activation of microglia in vivo. Systemic delivery of Formoterol inhibits behaviors related to neuropathic pain, such as mechanical hypersensitivity, cold allodynia and the aversive component of pain, and reverses chronically established neuropathic pain. Using conditional gene targeting for microglia-specific deletion of {beta}2-ARs, we demonstrate that the anti-allodynic effects of Formoterol are primarily mediated by microglia. Although Formoterol also reduces astrogliosis at late stages of neuropathic pain, these functions are unrelated to {beta}2-AR signaling in microglia. Our results underline the value of developing microglial {beta}2-AR agonists for relief from neuropathic pain and clarify mechanistic underpinnings.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/520924v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@166c767org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad3be9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1383f5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c852b1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

How PGRP3 mediates these immunomodulatory effects remains unknown. Identifying the proteins that interact with PGRP3 will help begin to address this important knowledge gap. Therefore, in this study our objective was to identify and validate novel PGRP3-protein interactions.\n\nMethodsPGRP3-protein interactions were identified using a yeast two-hybrid system. PGRP3 cloned into a pGBKT7 DNA-BD vector and transformed into a Y2HGold yeast strain served as the bait. A normalized universal human cDNA library cloned in a pGADT7 AD vector and pre-transformed into an Y187 yeast strain served as the prey. Y2HGold and Y187 yeast strains were mated and diploids were plated on selective media. True positive clones were sent in for DNA sequencing and corresponding proteins were identified through NCBI Blast. Two proteins were selected for validation. His-tagged PGRP3 expressing 293T cells were then co-transfected with expression vectors containing the identified proteins tagged with c-Myc. Lysates from co-transfected cells were subjected to anti-His and anti-Myc co-immunoprecipitation and analyzed with western blots.\n\nResultsFour unique proteins-- MBNL3, RBP5, ATXN2, and GPATCH8--were identified from our yeast two-hybrid screen.
