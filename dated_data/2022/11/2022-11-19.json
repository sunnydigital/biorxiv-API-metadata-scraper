    "abstract": "The link between fitness and reproduction rate is a central tenet in microbial genetics: mutants reproducing faster than the dominant wild-type are favoured by selection, otherwise the mutation is lost. This link is given by Fishers theorem under the assumption that fitness can only change through mutations. Here I show that fitness, as formalised by Fisher, changes through time without invoking new mutations--allowing the co-maintenance of fast- and slow-growing genotypes. The theorem does not account for changes in population growth that naturally occur due to resource depletion, but it is key to this unforeseen co-maintenance of growth strategies. To demonstrate that fitness is not constant, as Fishers theorem predicates, I co-maintained a construct of Escherichia coli harbouring pGW155B, a non-transmissible plasmid that protects against tetracycline, in competition assays without using antibiotics. Despite growing 40% slower than its drug-sensitive counterpart, the construct with pGW155B persisted throughout the competition without tetracycline--maintaining the plasmid. Thus, predicting the selection of microbial genotypes may be more difficult than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Performing a secondary task while driving causes a decline in driving performance. This phenomenon, called dual-task interference, can have lethal consequences. Previous fMRI studies have looked at the changes in the average brain activity to uncover the neural correlates of dual-task interference. From these results, it is unclear whether the overall modulations in brain activity result from general effects such as task difficulty, attentional modulations, and mental effort or whether it is caused by a change in the responses specific to each condition due to dual-task interference. To overcome this limitation, here, we used multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to interrogate the change in the information content in multiple brain regions during dual-task interference in simulated driving. Participants performed a lane change task in a simulated driving environment, along with a tone discrimination task with either short or long-time onset difference (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony, SOA) between the two tasks. Behavioral results indicated a robust dual-task effect on driving RT. MVPA revealed regions that carry information about the driving direction, including the superior parietal lobe (SPL), visual, and motor regions. Comparing the decoding accuracies across short and long SOA conditions, we showed lower accuracies in the SPL region in short than long SPA conditions. This change in accuracy was not observed in the visual and motor regions. In addition, the classification accuracy in the SPL was inversely correlated with participants reaction time in the driving task. These findings suggest that the dual-task interference in driving may be related to the disturbance of information processing in the SPL region.\n\nSignificance StatementDuring real-world driving, when a driver wants to make a turn at an intersection and simultaneously respond to a cell phone call, his reaction time slows down. This effect is called dual-task interference. Here, we aimed to examine its neural mechanisms using a paradigm that consisted of a driving turn task and a tone discrimination task in a simulated environment. Results showed that the information for the driving turn was disturbed in the superior parietal lobe (SPL) during dual-task interference. We suggest that the driving performance decline in the presence of the secondary task might be related to the disturbance of information in the SPL.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing of adaptive immune receptor repertoires is a valuable tool for receiving insights in adaptive immunity studies. Several powerful TCR/BCR repertoire reconstruction and analysis methods have been developed in the past decade. However, detecting and correcting the discrepancy between real and experimentally observed lymphocyte clone frequencies is still challenging. Here we discovered a hallmark anomaly in the ratio between read count and clone count-based frequencies of non-functional clonotypes in multiplex PCR-based immune repertoires. Calculating this anomaly, we formulated a quantitative measure of V- and J-genes frequency bias driven by multiplex PCR during library preparation called Over Amplification Rate (OAR). Based on the OAR concept, we developed an original software for multiplex PCR-specific bias evaluation and correction named iROAR: Immune Repertoire Over Amplification Removal (https://github.com/smiranast/iROAR). The iROAR algorithm was successfully tested on previously published TCR repertoires obtained using both 5 RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends)-based and multiplex PCR-based approaches and compared with a biological spike-in-based method for PCR bias evaluation. The developed approach can increase the accuracy and consistency of repertoires reconstructed by different methods making them more applicable for comparative analysis.",

    "abstract": "Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) promotes the intracellular assembly of protein complexes formed through phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain linkages. These interactions are weak and reversible, and the dephosphorylation of uncomplexed phosphorylated proteins can be rapid enough to reduce the time and length scales of protein complex persistence distal from the receptor. This limitation may be overcome by cytosolic kinases that rephosphorylate constituent complex proteins as they diffuse. To develop quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of these processes, we generated a reaction-diffusion model describing how membrane-bound epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activates the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 by assembling SHP2 complexes with the adaptor GRB2-associated binder 1 (GAB1). Src family kinases (SFKs) were included as a diffusible EGFR-activated intermediary kinase for GAB1. Contrary to the textbook picture of EGFR-mediated SHP2 activation, the model predicts that GAB1-SHP2 complexes can remain intact distal from membrane-retained EGFR at [~]80% of their plasma membrane concentration over the entire intracellular length scale. Parameter sensitivity analysis identified SFK inactivation as one of the most important kinetic processes controlling GAB1-SHP2 spatial persistence, revealing the key role of repeated adaptor phosphorylation in maintaining SHP2 activity. A simple order of magnitude analysis of the controlling rate processes supports the predictions of the coupled differential equation model. Furthermore, proximity ligation assays and immunofluorescence microscopy in carcinoma cells demonstrate that GAB1-SHP2 complexes are increasingly cytoplasmic and distal from EGFR as time proceeds after acute EGFR activation, consistent with model predictions. These results provide quantitative insight into a mechanism that may be alternately tuned for different receptors and downstream effector complexes to enable receptor control of signaling at a distance.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe textbook understanding of receptor-mediated signaling involves the assembly of protein complexes at the receptor cytosolic tail and complex movement within the cell by protein trafficking. However, reaction-diffusion processes can also play an important role in distributing signaling proteins throughout the cell, potentially quite distal from signal-initiating receptors. Indeed, receptors can activate cytosolic kinases that may maintain the phosphorylation-dependent complexation of downstream effector complexes through many rounds of complex dissociation and protein dephosphorylation. Here, we develop quantitative understanding of this mode of signal regulation through development of a mechanistic computational model and demonstrate, with experimental validation, that membrane-bound receptors can regulate signaling through downstream effector complexes over the entire intracellular length scale.",

As such, flow cytometry gating strategies and markers, such as CD90, to identify ILC have been applied. Here, we report that most non-NK intestinal ILC have a high expression of CD90 as expected, but surprisingly a sub-population of cells exhibit low or even no expression of this marker. CD90-negative and CD90-low CD127+ ILC were present amongst all ILC subsets in the gut. The frequency of CD90-negative and CD90-low CD127+ ILC was dependent on stimulatory cues in vitro and enhanced due to dysbiosis in vivo. CD90-negative and CD90-low CD127+ ILC played a functional role as a source of IL-13, IFN{gamma} and IL-17A at steady state and upon dysbiosis- and dextran sulphate sodium-elicited colitis. Hence, this study reveals that, contrary to expectations, CD90 is not constitutively expressed by functional ILC in the gut.",

    "abstract": "Indirect wildlife population surveying largely depends upon counts of artefacts of behavior (e.g., nests or dung). Likelihood to encounter these artefacts is derived from both artefact production and decay, and variability in production behavior is considered to contribute minimally to inaccuracy in wildlife estimation. Here, we demonstrate how ignoring behavioral variability contributes to significant population misestimation, using an example of an endangered ape, the bonobo (Pan paniscus). Until now, a single estimate of nest construction rate has been used to extrapolate bonobo densities, assumed to be broadly representative of bonobo sign production behavior. We estimated nest construction rates across seasons and social groups at the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve, DRC, and find nest construction rates in bonobos to be highly variable across populations as well as seasonal. Failure to account for this variability led to degradation in the accuracy of bonobo population estimates of abundance, accounting for a likely overestimation of bonobo numbers by 34%, and at worst as high as 80%. With this example, we demonstrate that failure to account for inter- and intra-population behavioral variation compromises the ability to estimate both relative and absolute wildlife abundances. We argue that variation in sign production is but one of several potential ways that behavioral variability can affect conservation monitoring, should be measured across contexts whenever possible, and must be considered in population estimation confidence intervals. With increasing attention to be-havioral variability as a potential tool for conservation, conservationists must also account for the impact that behavioral variability can play upon wildlife population estimation. Our results underline the importance of observational research to wildlife monitoring schemes as a critical component of conservation management. We discuss the avenues through which behavioral variability is likely to impact wildlife monitoring accuracy and precision and propose potential approaches for accounting for behavioral variability in wildlife monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Psilocybin, and its active metabolite psilocin, have been shown to elicit rapid and long-lasting symptom improvements in a variety of affective psychiatric illnesses. However, the region-specific alterations underlying these therapeutic effects remain relatively unknown. The central amygdala (CeA) is a primary output region within the extended amygdala that is dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders. Here, we measured CeA activity using the activity marker c-Fos and CeA reactivity using fiber photometry paired with an aversive air-puff stimulus. We found that psilocin administration acutely increased CeA activity in both males and females and increased stimulus specific CeA reactivity in females, but not males. In contrast, psilocin produced time-dependent decreases in reactivity in males, but not females as early as 2-days and lasting to 28-days post administration. We also measured behavioral responses to the air-puff stimulus and found sex-dependent changes in threat responding but not exploratory behavior or general locomotion. Repeated presentations of the auditory component of the air-puff were also performed and sex-specific effects of psilocin on CeA reactivity to the auditory-alone stimulus were also observed. This study provides new evidence that a single dose of psilocin produces sex-specific, time-dependent, and enduring changes in CeA reactivity and behavioral responding to specific components of an aversive stimulus.",

The delivered biomaterial provides mechanical support and attenuates wall thinning and elevated wall stress in the infarct region. This study aimed at developing a biventricular finite element model of an infarcted rat heart with a microstructural representation of an in situ biomaterial injectate, and a parametric investigation of the effect of the injectate stiffness on the cardiac mechanics.\n\nA three-dimensional subject-specific biventricular finite element model of a rat heart with left ventricular infarct and microstructurally dispersed biomaterial delivered one week after infarct induction was developed from ex vivo microcomputed tomography data. The volumetric mesh density varied between 303 mm-3 in the myocardium and 3,852 mm-3 in the injectate region due to the microstructural intramyocardial dispersion. Parametric simulations were conducted with the injectates elastic modulus varying from 4.1 to 405,900 kPa, and myocardial and injectate strains were recorded.\n\nWith increasing injectate stiffness, the end-diastolic median myocardial fibre and cross-fibre strain decreased in magnitude from 3.6% to 1.1% and from -6.0% to -2.9%, respectively. At end-systole, the myocardial fibre and cross-fibre strain decreased in magnitude from -20.4% to -11.8% and from 6.5% to 4.6%, respectively.

Unexpectedly LDHC enters nuclei and concentrates in centromeres. LDHC-generated L-2HG controls centromere condensation and pericentromeric heterochromatin organization through multiple effects including clustering of chromocenters, centromere and chromocenter condensation and expression of satellite RNAs. These effects are rapid and specific to L but not D-2HG. In vivo depletion of L-2HG causes centromere malfunction and activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint.

    "abstract": "Genome variation is the direct cause of cancer and driver of its clonal evolution. While the impact of many point mutations can be evaluated through their modification of individual genomic elements, even a single copy number aberration (CNA) may encompass hundreds of genes and therefore pose challenges to untangle potentially complex functional effects. However, consistent, recurring and disease-specific patterns in the genome-wide CNA landscape imply that particular CNA may promote cancer-type-specific characteristics. Discerning essential cancer-promoting alterations from the inherent co-dependency in CNA would improve the understanding of mechanisms of CNA and provide new insights into cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets. Here we implement a model using segmental breakpoints to discover non-random gene coverage by copy number deletion (CND). With a diverse set of cancer types from multiple resources, this model identified common and cancer-type-specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as cancer-promoting functional pathways. Confirmed by differential expression analysis of data from corresponding cancer types, the results show that for most cancer types, despite dissimilarity of their CND landscapes, similar canonical pathways are affected. In 25 analyses of 17 cancer types, we have identified 19 to 169 significant genes by copy deletion, including RB1, PTEN and CDKN2A as the most significantly deleted genes among all cancer types. We have also shown a shared dependence on core pathways for cancer progression in different cancers as well as cancer type separation by genome-wide significance scores. While this work provides a reference for gene specific significance in many cancers, it chiefly contributes a general framework to derive genomewide significance and molecular insights in CND profiles with a potential for the analysis of rare cancer types as well as non-coding regions.",

    "abstract": "The genome sequence of Wenzhou shrimp virus 8 (WzSV8) (GenBank record KX883984.1) was described in 2015 from wide screening for RNA viruses in aquatic animals. A closely related sequence (GenBank record OK662577.1) from the whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei was deposited in 2021 under the name Penaeus vannamei picornavirus (PvPV). In 2022 another closely related sequence (GenBank accession: OP265432) was submitted under the name Penaeus vannamei solinvivirus (PvSV). In 2021, prior to the publication of PvPV and PvSV, we used an RT-PCR method devised from the sequence of KX883984.1 (described herein) to screen for WzSV8 in specimens of cultivated shrimp. Samples that gave positive RT-PCR results were subsequently tested by in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis to identify virus target tissues. Several tissues gave positive ISH results within morphologically normal nuclei. Thus, these tissues were of no use for diagnosis of WzSV8 by normal histological analysis. However, unique basophilic, cytoplasmic inclusions within vacuoles in the hepatopancreatic E-cells were also found in the same WzSV8-positive shrimp specimens, sometimes accompanied by a smaller eosinophilic inclusion. We call these Lightner double Inclusions (LDI) that can be considered pathognomonic for diagnosis of WzSV8 infection when detected using the light microscope. Although no current proof of WzSV8 is the cause of disease, it is important to investigate new viruses and related tissue anomalies, even from normal cultivated shrimp, to determine whether they may have any relationship to significant negative effects on the production of cultivated shrimp.",

    "abstract": "Accurate genomic predisposition assessment is essential for the prevention and early detection of diseases. Polygenic scores and machine learning models have been developed for disease prediction based on genetic variants and other risk factors. However, over 80% of existing genomic data were acquired from individuals of European descent. As a result, clinico-genomic risk prediction is less accurate for non-European populations. Here we employ a transfer learning strategy to improve the clinico-genomic prediction of disease occurrence for the data-disadvantaged populations. Our multi-ancestral machine learning experiments on clinico-genomic datasets of cancers and Alzheimers disease and synthetic datasets with built-in data inequality and subpopulation shift show that transfer learning can significantly improve disease prediction accuracy for data-disadvantaged populations. Under the transfer learning scheme, the prediction accuracy for the data-disadvantaged populations can be improved without compromising the prediction accuracy for other populations. Therefore, transfer learning provides a Pareto improvement toward equitable machine learning for genomic medicine.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites uniquely depend on protein secretion for their obligate intracellular lifestyle but approaches for dissecting Plasmodium secreted protein functions are limited. We report knockER, a novel DiCre-mediated knock-sideways approach to sequester secreted proteins in the ER by inducible fusion with a KDEL ER-retrieval sequence. We show conditional ER sequestration of diverse proteins is not generally toxic, enabling loss-of-function studies. We employed knockER in multiple Plasmodium species to interrogate the trafficking, topology and function of an assortment of proteins that traverse the secretory pathway to diverse compartments including the apicoplast (ClpB1), rhoptries (RON6), dense granules and parasitophorous vacuole (EXP2, PTEX150, HSP101). Taking advantage of the unique ability to redistribute secreted proteins from their terminal destination to the ER, we reveal vacuolar levels of the PTEX translocon component HSP101 but not PTEX150 are maintained in excess of what is required to sustain effector protein export into the erythrocyte. Intriguingly, vacuole depletion of HSP101 hypersensitized parasites to a destabilization tag that inhibits HSP101-PTEX complex formation but not to translational knockdown of the entire HSP101 pool, illustrating how redistribution of a target protein by knockER can be used to query function in a compartment-specific manner. Collectively, our results establish knockER as a novel tool for dissecting secreted protein function with sub-compartmental resolution that should be widely amenable to genetically tractable eukaryotes.\n\nSignificanceProtein trafficking and secretion through the endomembrane system is a defining feature of eukaryotes. The secretory pathway is central to the unique biology and pathology of the obligate intracellular malaria parasite, however tools for studying secreted protein function are limited. Knock-sideways is a powerful mutagenesis strategy that conditionally sequesters a protein away from its site of function but is generally not applicable to secreted proteins. We developed a simple approach to conditionally sequester Plasmodium secreted proteins in the ER by inducible C-terminal fusion with a KDEL ER-retrieval sequence that can be used for trafficking, topology and loss-of-function studies. The knockER strategy is broadly applicable to functional dissection of proteins that traverse the eukaryotic secretory pathway.",

    "abstract": "Walking balance is central to independent mobility, and falls due to loss of balance are a leading cause of death for people 65 years of age and older. Bipedal gait is typically unstable, but healthy humans use corrective torques to counteract perturbations and stabilize gait. Exoskeleton assistance could benefit people with neuromuscular deficits by providing stabilizing torques at lower-limb joints to replace lost muscle strength and sensorimotor control. However, it is unclear how applied exoskeleton torques translate to changes in walking kinematics. This study used musculoskeletal simulation to investigate how exoskeleton torques applied to the ankle and subtalar joints alter center of mass kinematics during walking. We first created muscle-driven walking simulations using OpenSim Moco by tracking experimental kinematics and ground reaction forces recorded from five healthy adults. We then used forward integration to simulate the effect of exoskeleton torques applied to the ankle and subtalar joints while keeping muscle excitations fixed based on our previous tracking simulation results. Exoskeleton torque lasted for 15% of the gait cycle and was applied between foot-flat and toe-off during the stance phase, and changes in center of mass kinematics were recorded when the torque application ended. We found that changes in center of mass kinematics were dependent on both the type and timing of exoskeleton torques. Plantarflexion torques produced upward and backward changes in velocity of the center of mass in mid-stance and upward and forward velocity changes near toe-off. Eversion and inversion torques primarily produced lateral and medial changes in velocity in mid-stance, respectively. Intrinsic muscle properties reduced kinematic changes from exoskeleton torques. Our results provide mappings between ankle plantarflexion and inversion-eversion torques and changes in center of mass kinematics which can inform designers building exoskeletons aimed at stabilizing balance during walking. Our simulations and software are freely available and allow researchers to explore the effects of applied torques on balance and gait.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent network models are instrumental in investigating how behaviorally-relevant computations emerge from collective neural dynamics. A recently developed class of models based on low-rank connectivity provides an analytically tractable framework for understanding of how connectivity structure determines the geometry of low-dimensional dynamics and the ensuing computations. Such models however lack some fundamental biological constraints, and in particular represent individual neurons in terms of abstract units that communicate through continuous firing rates rather than discrete action potentials. Here we examine how far the theoretical insights obtained from low-rank rate networks transfer to more biologically plausible networks of spiking neurons. Adding a low-rank structure on top of random excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, we systematically compare the geometry of activity in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons to rate networks with statistically equivalent low-rank connectivity. We show that the mean-field predictions of rate networks allow us to identify low-dimensional dynamics at constant population-average activity in spiking networks, as well as novel non-linear regimes of activity such as out-of-phase oscillations and slow manifolds. We finally exploit these results to directly build spiking networks that perform nonlinear computations.\n\nAuthor summaryBehaviorally relevant information processing is believed to emerge from interactions among neurons forming networks in the brain, and computational modeling is an important approach for understanding this process. Models of neuronal networks have been developed at different levels of detail, with typically a trade off between analytic tractability and biological realism. The relation between network connectivity, dynamics and computations is best understood in abstract models where individual neurons are represented as simplified units with continuous firing activity. Here we examine how far the results obtained in a specific, analytically-tractable class of rate models extend to more biologically realistic spiking networks where neurons interact through discrete action potentials. Our results show that abstract rate models provide accurate predictions for the collective dynamics and the resulting computations in more biologically faithful spiking networks.",

    "abstract": "Colistin resistance is caused by different lipopolysaccharide (LPS) modifications, and we propose to evaluate the effect on the innate immune response of in vivo and in vitro colistin resistance acquisition. We used 2 pairs of isogenic strains: (1) Escherichia coli ATCC25922, susceptible to colistin and its isogenic transconjugant-carrying mcr-1 gene; and (2) OXA-48, CTX-M-15 K. pneumoniae susceptible to colistin (CS-Kp) isolated from a urinary infection and its colistin-resistant variant (CR-Kp) from the same patient after prolonged treatment with colistin. No mutation of described genes for colistin resistance (pmrA, pmrB, mgrB. phoP/Q and crrAB) were found in the CR-Kp genome; however, LPS modifications were characterized by negative-ion MALDI-TOF. The strains were co-cultured with human monocytes to determine their survival after phagocytosis and induction to apoptosis. Also, monocytes were stimulated with bacterial LPS to study cytokine and immunecheckpoint production. The addition of 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (Ara4N) to lipid A of CR-Kp accounted for the colistin resistance. CR-Kp survived significantly longer inside human monocytes after being phagocytosed compared with the CS-Kp strain, whereas no significant differences were observed for the E. coli isogenic strains. In addition, LPS from CR-Kp induced both higher apoptosis in monocytes and higher levels of cytokine and immune checkpoint production than LPS from CS-Kp. This effect was strictly the opposite for E. coli. Our data reveal a variable impact of colistin resistance on the innate immune system, depending on the responsible mechanism. Adding Ara4N to LPS increases bacterial survival after phagocytosis and elicits a higher inflammatory response than its colistin-susceptible counterpart.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter cinaedi infects the human gut and causes invasive infections such as bacteremia and cellulitis through bacterial translocation. However, the mechanism by which H. cinaedi attaches to host cells and establishes infection remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between a novel putative autotransporter protein, H. cinaedi autotransporter protein A (HcaA), and its role in pathogenicity. The cytotoxicity of H. cinaedi infection in colon epithelial cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) was assessed using a lactate dehydrogenase assay, and it was found that cytotoxicity significantly decreased by HcaA knockout. Adhesion assays further revealed that the HcaA-knockout strain showed significantly reduced attachment to the human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) compared to that of the wild-type strain. Moreover, the recombinant HcaA protein demonstrated strong adhesion properties to the human monocytic cell line (U937). The adhesive activity was diminished when the RGD motif in HcaA was replaced with RAD, indicating that the RGD motif in HcaA is crucial for host cell adhesion. To determine the role of HcaA in H. cinaedi infection in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were orally infected with wild-type and HcaA-knockout H. cinaedi strains. Bacterial colonization was assesed 7, 14, and 28 days post-infection. At 7 days post-infection, colonization was significantly lower in mice infected with the HcaA-knockout strain compared to those infected with the wild-type strain. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HcaA, a novel putative autotransporter protein in H. cinaedi, plays a significant role as an adhesin in establishing colonization.\n\nIMPORTANCEHelicobacter species are classified as gastric or enterohepatic according to their habitat. Among enterohepatic Helicobacter species, which inhabit the intestine, colon and liver, H. cinaedi has been most frequently isolated from humans. H. cinaedi often causes bacteremia and cellulitis in immunocompromised hosts. Here, we focused on the H. cinaedi autotransporter protein A (HcaA), a novel virulence factor in H. cinaedi. We discovered that HcaA contributes to cell adhesion via its RGD motif. Furthermore, in animal experiments, bacterial colonization was reduced in mice infected with HcaA-knockout strains, supporting the hypothesis that HcaA contributes to H. cinaedi adhesion to host cells. Our study provides a novel mechanism for the establishment of H. cinaedi infections and provides new insights into the role of autotransporter proteins in the establishment of Helicobacter infection.",

However, our understanding of their origin, evolution and ecological functions remains poorly constrained. Based on the phylogeny of the present largest dataset of Bathyarchaeia metagenome assembled genome (MAG), we reclassified Bathyarchaeia into eight order-level units and corresponded to the former subgroup system. Highly diversified and versatile carbon metabolisms were discovered among different orders, particularly atypical C1 metabolic pathways, indicating that Bathyarchaeia represent overlooked important methylotrophs. Molecular dating results indicate that Bathyarchaeia diverged at [~]3.3 Ga, followed by three major diversifications at [~]3.0 Ga, [~]2.5 Ga and [~]1.8-1.7 Ga, likely driven by continental emergence, growth and intensive submarine volcanism, respectively. The lignin-degrading Bathyarchaeia clade emerged at [~]300 Ma and perhaps contributed to the sharply decreased carbon sequestration rate during the Late Carboniferous period. The evolutionary pathway of Bathyarchaeia potentially have been shaped by geological forces, which in turn impacted the Earths surface environment.\n\nTeaserThe origin and divergence of Bathyarchaeia linked to the early Earth tectonics and surface environment changes",

Pairs of Pex1/Pex6(D2) subdomains engage the substrate via a staircase of pore-1 loops with distinct properties. The first ring (D1) is catalytically inactive but undergoes significant conformational changes resulting in alternate widening and narrowing of its pore. These events are fueled by ATP hydrolysis in the D2 ring and disengagement of a \"twin-seam\" Pex1/Pex6(D2) heterodimer from the staircase. Mechanical forces are propagated in a unique manner along Pex1/Pex6 interfaces that are not available in homo-oligomeric AAA-ATPases.

DPYSL2 has multiple RNA and protein isoforms, but few studies have differentiated between them or explored their individual functions. We previously demonstrated in HEK293 cells that a schizophrenia -associated variant in the DPYSL2 B isoform (DPYSL2-B) reduced the length of cellular projections, created a transcriptomic disturbance that captured schizophrenia etiology, and was acted upon by the mTOR pathway. In the present study, we follow up on these results by creating, to our knowledge, the first models of endogenous DPYSL2-B knockout in human induced pluripotent stem cells and excitatory glutamatergic neurons. We use CRISPR/Cas9 to specifically knock out DPYSL2-B and observe corresponding reduction of its RNA and protein. The average length of dendrites in knockout neurons was reduced up to 58% compared to controls. Transcriptome analysis reveals disruptions in pathways highly relevant to psychiatric disease including mTOR signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, immune function, calcium signaling, and cholesterol biosynthesis.

    "abstract": "Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is an essential epigenetic regulator that mainly controls histone H2A Lys119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub). BMI1 and RING1B are PRC1 core components and play critical roles in the development of various cancers. However, therapeutic agents targeting PRC1 are very limited, and small-molecule inhibitors of PRC1 displayed limited effectiveness in killing cancer cells. In this study, MS147, the first degrader of PRC1 core components, BMI1 and RING1B, was discovered via a novel protein complex degradation strategy that utilizes the target proteins interacting partner protein (EED) to degrade BMI1 and RING1B. MS147, which comprises an EED small-molecule binder linked to a ligand of the E3 ligase VHL, degrades BMI1 and RING1B in an EED-, VHL-, ubiquitination- and time-dependent manner. MS147 is selective and preferentially degrades BMI1 and RING1B over PRC2 core components: EED, EZH2 and SUZ12. Consequently, MS147 effectively reduces H2AK119ub, but not H3K27me3, which is catalyzed by PRC2. Furthermore, MS147, but not the parent EED binder or known PRC2 degraders, effectively inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines that are insensitive to EZH2 knockout or PRC2 degraders. Overall, this study provides a novel degrader targeting BMI1 and RING1B, which is a useful chemical tool to further investigate the roles of PRC1 in cancer, and a novel protein complex degradation strategy, which could potentially expand the degradable human proteome.",

    "abstract": "Trauma, surgery, and infection can cause severe inflammation. Both dysregulated inflammation intensity and duration can lead to significant tissue injuries, organ dysfunction, mortality, and morbidity. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids and immunosuppressants can dampen inflammation intensity, but they derail inflammation resolution, compromise normal immunity, and have significant adverse effects. The natural inflammation regulator mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have high therapeutic potential because of their unique capabilities to mitigate inflammation intensity, enhance normal immunity, and accelerate inflammation resolution and tissue healing. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown that MSCs are safe and effective. However, they are not potent enough, alone, to completely resolve severe inflammation and injuries. One approach to boost the potency of MSCs is to combine them with synergistic agents. We hypothesized that alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), a plasma protein used clinically and having an excellent safety profile, was a promising candidate for synergism. This investigation examined the efficacy and synergy of MSCs and A1AT to mitigate inflammation and to promote resolution, using in vitro cell cultures and a mouse acute lung injury and inflammation model. We found that the combination of MSCs and A1AT was much more effective than each component alone in i) modulating cytokine releases and inflammatory pathways, ii) inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) production by neutrophils, iii) enhancing phagocytosis and, iv) promoting inflammation resolution, tissue healing, and animal survival. Our results support the combined use of MSCs and A1AT for managing severe, acute inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Reducing disparities is critical to promote equity of access to precision treatments for all patients with cancer. While socioenvironmental factors are a major driver behind such disparities, biological differences also are likely to contribute. The prioritization of cancer drug targets is foundational for drug discovery, yet whether ancestry-related signals in target discovery pipelines exist has not been systematically explored due to the absence of data at the appropriate scale. Here, we analyzed data from 611 genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 viability experiments in human cell line models as part of the Cancer Dependency Map to identify ancestry-associated genetic dependencies. Surprisingly, we found that most putative associations between ancestry and dependency arose from artifacts related to germline variants that are present at different frequencies across ancestry groups. In 2-5% of genes profiled in each cellular model, germline variants in sgRNA targeting sequences likely reduced cutting by the CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease. Unfortunately, this bias disproportionately affected cell models derived from individuals of recent African descent because their genomes tended to diverge more from the consensus genome typically used for CRISPR/Cas9 guide design. To help the scientific community begin to resolve this source of bias, we report three complementary methods for ancestry-agnostic CRISPR experiments. This report adds to a growing body of literature describing ways in which ancestry bias impacts cancer research in underappreciated ways.",

    "abstract": "Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology1, with broad impact2 in pharmaceutical formulation3, drug delivery4, biosensing5, and biocatalysis6,7. Despite this importance, the process of protein crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical8-10, with largely unpredictable crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements, and space group preferences, and the programming of protein crystallization through precisely engineered sidechain-sidechain interactions across multiple protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach to designing three-dimensional (3D) protein crystals with pre-specified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall degree of freedoms (DOFs) of the system. We use the approach to design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into large 3D crystals (>100 m). Small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray crystallography show these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, with the design target F4132 and I432 space groups and closely corresponding overall architectures and protein-protein interfaces. The crystal unit cell dimensions can be systematically redesigned while retaining space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are both extremely porous and highly stable, enabling the robust scaffolding of inorganic nanoparticle arrays. Our approach thus enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and since both structure and assembly are encoded in the primary sequence, provides a powerful new platform for biological material engineering.",

However, they regulate context-specific genes and occupy distinct genomic regions in different cell types. Here, we show that dynamic Runx binding shifts in early T-cell development are mostly not restricted by local chromatin state but regulated by Runx dosage and functional partners. Runx co-factors compete to recruit a limited pool of Runx factors in early T-progenitors, and a modest increase in Runx protein availability at pre-commitment stages causes premature Runx occupancy at post-commitment binding sites. This results in striking T-lineage developmental acceleration by selectively activating T-identity and innate lymphoid cell programs. These are collectively regulated by Runx together with other, Runx-induced transcription factors that co-occupy Runx target genes and propagate gene network changes.",

However, it remains unclear how these population-level responses emerge from collective single-cell responses. During beta-lactam treatment, it is well recognized that individual cells often exhibit varying degrees of filamentation before lysis. We show that the probability of cell lysis increases with the extent of filamentation and that this dependence is characterized by unique parameters that are specific to bacterial strain, antibiotic dose, and growth condition. Modeling demonstrates how the single-cell lysis probabilities can give rise to population-level biomass dynamics, which were experimentally validated. This mapping provides insights into how the population biomass time-kill curve emerges from single cells and allows the representation of both single-and population-level responses with universal parameters.",

    "abstract": "Environmental microbiomes are constantly exposed to invasion events through foreign, antibiotic resistant bacteria that were enriched in the anthropic sphere. However, the biotic and abiotic factors, as well as the natural barriers that determine the invasion success of these invader bacteria into the environmental microbiomes are poorly understood. A great example of such invasion events are river microbial communities constantly exposed to resistant bacteria originating from wastewater effluents. Here, we aim at gaining comprehensive insights into the key factors that determine their invasion success with a particular focus on the effects of environmental stressors, regularly co-released in wastewater effluents. Understanding invasion dynamics of resistant bacteria is crucial for limiting the environmental spread of antibiotic resistance. To achieve this, we grew natural microbial biofilms on glass slides in rivers for one month. The biofilms were then transferred to laboratory, recirculating flume systems and exposed to a single pulse of a model resistant invader bacterium (E. coli) either in presence or absence of stress induced by Cu2+. The invasion dynamics of E. coli into the biofilms were then monitored for 14 days. Despite an initially successful introduction of E. coli into the biofilms, independent of the imposed stress, over time the invader perished in absence of stress. However, under stress c the invading strain successfully established and proliferated in the biofilms. Noteworthy, the increased establishment success of the invader coincided with a loss in microbial community diversity under stress conditions, likely due to additional niche space becoming available for the invader.",

    "abstract": "Many insects contain endosymbiotic bacteria within their bodies. In multiple endosymbiotic systems comprising two or more symbionts, each of the symbionts is generally localized in a different host cell or tissue. Bemisia tabaci (Sweet potato whitefly)possesses a unique endosymbiotic system where co-obligate symbionts are localized in the same bacteriocytes. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that endosymbionts in B. tabaci MEAM1 occupy distinct subcellular habitats, or niches, within a single bacteriocyte. Hamiltonella was located adjacent to the nucleus of the bacteriocyte, while Portiera was present in the cytoplasm surrounding Hamiltonella. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum separates the two symbionts. Habitat segregation was maintained for longer durations in female bacteriocytes. The same segregation was observed in three genetically distinct B. tabaci groups (MEAM1, MED Q1, and Asia II 6) and Trialeurodes vaporariorum, which shared a common ancestor with Bemisia over 80 million years ago, even though the coexisting symbionts and the size of bacteriocytes were different. These results suggest that the habitat segregation system existed in the common ancestor and was conserved in both lineages, despite different bacterial partners coexisting with Portiera. Our findings provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of complex endosymbiotic systems and highlight the importance of organelles for the construction of separate niches for endosymbionts.\n\nImportanceCo-obligate endosymbionts in B. tabaci are exceptionally localized within the same bacteriocyte (a specialized cell for endosymbiosis), but the underlying mechanism for their coexistence remains largely unknown. This study provides evidence for niche segregation at the subcellular level between the two symbionts. We showed that the endoplasmic reticulum is a physical barrier separating the two species. Despite differences in co-obligate partners, this subcellular niche segregation was conserved across various whitefly species. The physical proximity of symbionts may enable the efficient biosynthesis of essential nutrients via shared metabolic pathways. The expression \"Good fences make good neighbors\" appears to be true for insect endosymbiotic systems.",

Studying plant-associated fungal biofilms can enhance understanding of fungal biology and knowledge of the links between fungal diseases and plants. However, only a few plant-associated fungi are reported to form biofilms. This study aimed to examine the ability of a mycotoxigenic fungus of maize, Fusarium verticillioides, to form biofilms under laboratory conditions. During our investigation, F. verticillioides stationary phase cultures incubated in liquid media developed a biofilm-like pellicle with a hyphal assemblage that appears in the form of a cloudy and thin slime material. Under the microscope, the biofilms exhibited a highly heterogeneous architecture made of dense, entangled, and compact hyphae, which were accompanied by a quantifiable EPS and extracellular DNA (eDNA). The biofilm was also found to respond to different abiotic conditions including pH and temperature, suggesting their relevance in a field setting. We further demonstrate the biofilm structural maintenance role of eDNA through treatment with DNase, which was only marginally effective during late biofilm stages, suggesting that it forms complex interactions with the EPS during biofilm maturation. Based on these results, we propose that F. verticillioides forms a  true biofilm that may act as a potential virulence factor.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is one of the most essential and energy-consuming cellular functions. It takes place mainly in the nucleolus. For cancer cells, the nucleolar function is especially important due to the high demand for ribosomes to support continuous proliferation. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of existing chemotherapy drugs on the nucleolar state. For this, we conducted an imaging-based screen for anticancer drugs that induce morphological re-organization consistent with nucleolar stress. For a readout, we developed a novel parameter termed \"nucleolar normality score\", which measures ratios of dense fibrillar center and granular component in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. We show that multiple classes of drugs cause nucleolar stress, including DNA intercalators, inhibitors of mTOR/PI3K, heat shock proteins, proteasome, and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Different classes of drugs induced morphologically and molecularly distinct states of nucleolar stress. By applying phospho-proteomics and live imaging strategies, we characterized in detail the nucleolar stress induced by inhibition of transcriptional CDKs, particularly CDK9, the main CDK that targets RNA Pol II. Inhibition of CDK9 dramatically reduced rRNA production, caused dissociation of RNA Polymerase I catalytic subunit POLR1A from ribosomal DNA and dispersal of the nucleolar granular component, a stress we refer to as the \"bare scaffold\" state. We identified multiple nucleolar CDK phosphorylation substrates, including RNA Pol I - associated protein Treacle, and demonstrated that CDK9 can phosphorylate Treacle in vitro. This implies that transcriptional CDKs coordinate the action of RNA pol I and RNA pol II. Furthermore, molecular dynamics analysis of the endogenous nucleolar protein NPM1 demonstrated that CDK inhibition vastly increased its mobility, consistent with the loss of nucleolar integrity. We conclude that many classes of chemotherapy compounds directly or indirectly target nucleolar structure and function, and recommend considering this in anticancer drug development.",

Here we introduce two relevant advances: a) we demonstrate the utility of multi-color super-resolution radial fluctuation light microscopy under cryogenic conditions (cryo-SRRF), and b) we extend the use of deconvolution processing for dual-axis CSTET data. We show that cryo-SRRF nanoscopy is able to reach resolutions in the range of 100 nm, using commonly available fluorophores and a conventional widefield microscope for cryo-correlative light-electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM). Such resolution aids in precisely identifying regions of interest before tomographic acquisition and enhances precision in localizing features of interest within the 3D reconstruction. Dual-axis CSTET tilt series data and application of entropy regularized deconvolution during post-processing results in close-to isotropic resolution in the reconstruction without averaging. We show individual protein densities in a mitochondrion-ER contact in a cell region 850 nm thick.

However, generating hPSC-derived HSPCs has been elusive, necessitating a better understanding of the native developmental mechanisms that trigger HSPC specification. Here, we revealed in vivo an intrinsic inflammatory mechanism triggered by Nod1 that drives early hemogenic endothelium (HE) patterning to specify HSPCs. Our genetic and chemical experiments showed that HSPCs failed to specify in the absence of Nod1 and its downstream kinase Ripk2.

Urine proteomes before-after smoking of each rat were compared individually, while the control group was set up to rule out differences caused by rat growth and development. After smoking, the differential proteins produced by rats shows strong individual variation. Fetuin-B, a biomarker of COPD, and annexin A2, which is recognized as a multiple tumor marker, were identified as the differential proteins in five out of six smoking rats on day 3. To our surprise, odorant-binding proteins expressed in the olfactory epithelium were also found and were significantly upregulated, which may help explain olfactory adaptation. Pathways enriched by the differential proteins shows the evidence that smoking e-cigarettes affects the immune system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, etc., which provides clues for further exploration of the mechanism of e-cigarettes on the human body.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrug-resistant focal epilepsy, defined by failure of two antiepileptic drugs, affects about 30% of patients with epilepsy. Epilepsy surgery may represent an alternative options for this population. However, defining the epileptogenic zone to be surgically removed requires highly specialised medical expertise as well as advanced technologies. The aim of this work is building a cost-effective support system based on text, in particular based on the semiological descriptions of the seizures (temporal vs extratemporal lobe; right vs left hemisphere), in order to predict the localization of seizure origin.\n\nMethodsAmong a population of 121 surgically treated and seizure-free drug-resistant patients suffering with focal epilepsy, recruited at the Niguarda Hospital in Milan, we extracted a total number of 509 descriptions of seizures. After a data pre-processing phase, we used natural language processing tools to build numerical representations of the seizures descriptions, both using embedding and countbased methods. We then used machine learning models performing a binary classification into right/left and temporal/extra-temporal.\n\nResultsAll predictive models show a better performance when using the representations relying on embedding models respect to count-based ones. Between all the combinations of representations and classifiers, the best performance obtained in terms of F1-score is 84.7% {+/-} 0.6.\n\nDiscussionThis preliminary work reached encouraging results considering both localization tasks. The main advantage is that no specific knowledge about epilepsy is used to build the models, rendering our pipeline applicable also in other scenarios. The major limitation lies in the fact that the text is highly specific to the writer.",

It is an allohexaploid composed of three homeologous sub-genomes (AA, BB, and DD), which is a constraint in determining the complete genome sequence. Several transcription factors have been implicated in both abiotic and biotic stress. WRKY transcription factors are among the best characterised in the context of pathogen defence mechanisms. Different members of the WRKY transcription factors have been shown to confer resistance to stress. But very little is known about the wheat WRKY transcription factors. In silico analysis of the TaWRKY45 protein was performed in the present study using several bioinformatics tools like motif scan, CD search, Netphos, NGlycos, GRAVY, and the SWISS MODEL. The study revealed that TaWRKY45 belongs to the group III family and contains hydrophilic proteins with 19 potential phosphorylation sites. TaWRKY45 protein was found to be orthologous to rice OsWRKY45 by phylogenetic analysis. The catalytic domain was analysed by motif scan which showed that TaWRKY45 has one WRKY domain and a C2-HC zinc finger motif. TaWRKY45s structure was determined to be more stable, more constrained, more compact, and have greater potential to interact with other molecules than OsWRKY45, according to MD simulation analysis. Thus, in silico analysis of transcription factors helps study protein function, interaction, and regulatory pathways.",

Belonging to a metabolic pathway converging on the citric acid cycle, it is present in most forms of life and irregularities in its assembly lead to serious illness in humans, known as propionic acidemia. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures and assembly of different oligomeric isomers of endogenous PCC from the parasitic protozoan Leishmania tarentolae (LtPCC). These structures and their statistical distribution reveal the mechanics of PCC assembly and disassembly at equilibrium. We show that, in solution, endogenous LtPCC {beta}-subunits form stable homohexamers, to which different numbers of -subunits attach. Sorting LtPCC particles into seven classes (i.e., oligomeric formulas 0{beta}6, 1{beta}6, 2{beta}6, 3{beta}6, 4{beta}6, 5{beta}6, 6{beta}6) enables formulation of a model for PCC assembly. Our results suggest how multimerization regulates PCC enzymatic activity and showcase the utility of cryoEM in revealing the statistical mechanics of reaction pathways.",

We performed scRNA-seq on 15 VS samples, with paired scATAC-seq in six samples. We identified diverse Schwann cell (SC), stromal, and immune populations in the VS TME and found that repair-like and MHC-II antigen presenting subtype SCs are associated with increased myeloid cell infiltrate, implicating a nerve injury-like process. Deconvolution analysis of RNA-expression data from 175 tumors revealed Injury-like tumors are associated with larger tumor size, and scATAC-seq identified transcription factors associated with nerve repair among SCs from Injury-like tumors. Ligand-receptor analysis and functional in vitro experiments suggested that SCs recruit monocytes.

The outcome of these pathways determine the capacity of the organism to survive under challenging conditions. Both extracellular ATP (eATP) and Adenosine (eAdo) act as secondary messengers in mammals, essential for immunosuppressive responses. Despite the clear role of eATP as a plant damage-associated molecular pattern, the function of its nucleoside, eAdo, and of the eAdo/eATP balance in plant stress response remain to be fully elucidated. This is particularly relevant in the context of plant/microbe interaction, where the intruder manipulates the extracellular matrix. Here, we identify Ado as a main elicitor secreted by the vascular fungus Fusarium oxysporum. We show that eAdo modulates the plants susceptibility to fungal colonization by altering eATP-mediated physiological immune responses, such as apoplastic pH and calcium homeostasis. Our work indicates that plant pathogens actively imbalance the eAdo/eATP levels as a virulence mechanism.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe apoplastic Adenosine/ATP balance is a messenger for plant defense and can be manipulated by the fungal pathogen F. oxysporum.",

    "abstract": "Use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl increased [~]300% in the last decade, including among women of reproductive ages. Adverse neonatal outcomes and long-term behavioral disruptions are associated with perinatal opioid exposure. Our previous work demonstrated that perinatal fentanyl exposed mice displayed enhanced negative affect and somatosensory circuit and behavioral disruptions during adolescence. However, little is known about molecular adaptations across brain regions that underlie these outcomes. We performed RNA-sequencing across three reward and two sensory brain areas to study transcriptional programs in perinatal fentanyl exposed juvenile mice. Pregnant dams received 10g/ml fentanyl in the drinking water from embryonic day 0 (E0) through gestational periods until weaning at postnatal day 21 (P21). RNA was extracted from nucleus accumbens (NAc), prelimbic cortex (PrL), ventral tegmental area (VTA), somatosensory cortex (S1) and ventrobasal thalamus (VBT) from perinatal fentanyl exposed mice of both sexes at P35. RNA-sequencing was performed, followed by analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene co-expression networks. Transcriptome analysis revealed DEGs and gene modules significantly associated with exposure to perinatal fentanyl in a sex-wise manner. The VTA had the most DEGs, while robust gene enrichment occurred in NAc. Genes enriched in mitochondrial respiration were pronounced in NAc and VTA of perinatal fentanyl exposed males, extracellular matrix (ECM) and neuronal migration enrichment were pronounced in NAc and VTA of perinatal fentanyl exposed males, while genes associated with vesicular cycling and synaptic signaling were markedly altered in NAc of perinatal fentanyl exposed female mice. In sensory areas from perinatal fentanyl exposed females, we found alterations in mitochondrial respiration, synaptic and ciliary organization processes. Our findings demonstrate distinct transcriptomes across reward and sensory brain regions, with some showing discordance between sexes. These transcriptome adaptations may underlie structural, functional, and behavioral changes observed in perinatal fentanyl exposed mice.",

    "abstract": "Scientific AbstractNovel genes are essential for evolutionary innovations and differ substantially even between closely related species. Recently, multiple studies across many taxa have suggested that some novel genes arise de novo, i.e. from previously non-coding DNA. In order to characterise the underlying mutations that allowed de novo gene emergence and their order of occurrence, homologous regions must be detected within non-coding sequences in closely related sister genomes. So far, most studies do not detect non-coding homologs of de novo genes due to inconsistent data and long evolutionary distances separating genomes. Here we overcome these issues by searching for proto-genes, the not-yet fixed precursors of de novo genes that emerged within a single species. We sequenced and assembled genomes with long-read technology and the corresponding transcriptomes from inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster, derived from seven geographically diverse populations. We found line-specific proto-genes in abundance but few proto-genes shared by lines, suggesting a rapid turnover. Gain and loss of transcription is more frequent than the creation of Open Reading Frames (ORFs), e.g. by forming new START- and STOP-codons. Consequently, the gain of ORFs becomes rate limiting and is frequently the initial step in proto-gene emergence. Furthermore, Transposable Elements (TEs) are major drivers for intra genomic duplications of proto-genes, yet TE insertions are less important for the emergence of proto-genes. However, highly mutable genomic regions around TEs provide new features that enable gene birth. In conclusion, proto-genes have a high birth-death rate, are rapidly purged, but surviving proto-genes spread neutrally through populations and within genomes.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is an established factor contributing to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, implicating the possible detrimental effects of inflammatory cytokines on motor neurons. The RNA/DNA-binding protein TDP-43 has emerged as a pivotal actor in ALS, because TDP-43 mutations cause familial ALS and loss of nuclear TDP-43, associated with its redistribution into cytoplasmic aggregates (TDP-43 proteinopathy) in motor neurons occurs in 97% of ALS cases. However, mechanisms linking neuroinflammation to TDP-43 mislocalization have not been described. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune-modulatory protein, highly expressed on cell surfaces following acute inflammatory stress. To determine which inflammatory cytokines might impact motor neuron function, seven cytokines known to be elevated in ALS patients cerebrospinal fluid were tested for their effects on PD-L1 expression in human iPSC-derived motor neurons. Among the tested cytokines, only interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) was found to strongly promote PD-L1 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that excessive exposure to IFN-{gamma} may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. We observed that neuronal populations exposed to IFN-{gamma} exhibited severe TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation and excitotoxic behavior correlated with impaired neural firing activity, hallmarks of ALS pathology, in both normal and ALS mutant (TARDB1K+/-) neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed possible mechanisms for these effects. Motor neurons exposed to IFN-{gamma} exhibited an extensive shift of their gene expression profile toward a neurodegenerative phenotype. Notably, IFN-{gamma} treatment induced aberrant expression levels for 70 genes that are listed in the recent literature as being dysregulated in various ALS subtypes. Additionally, we found that genes related to neuronal electrophysiology, protein aggregation, and TDP-43 misregulation were abnormally expressed in IFN-{gamma} treated cells. Moreover, IFN-{gamma} induced a significant reduction in the expression of genes that encode indispensable proteins for neuromuscular synapse development and maintenance, implying that the continuous cytokine exposure could directly impair signal transmission between motor axons and muscle membranes. Our findings suggest that IFN-{gamma} could be a potent upstream pathogenic driver of ALS and provide potential candidates for future therapeutic targets to treat sporadic forms of ALS, which account for roughly 90% of reported cases.",
