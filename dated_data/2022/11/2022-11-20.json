    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPreserving microbial diversity in food systems is one of the many challenges to be met to achieve food security and quality. Although industrialization led to the selection and spread of specific fermenting microbial strains, there are still ongoing artisanal processes that may allow the conservation of a wider species diversity and genetic diversity. We examined whether the diversity of artisanal practices could lead to an increased level in fungal species diversity for bread making. We used an interdisciplinary participatory research approach including bakers, psycho-sociologists and microbiologists to analyze French bread making practices and describe fungal communities in naturally fermented sourdough of 27 bakers and 12 farmer bakers. Bread making practices were classified in two groups: the farmer-like practice group and the artisanal-like practice group. The well-known bakery yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was dominant (i.e. with a relative abundance over 50%) in only 24% of sourdoughs while other yeast species, belonging to the Kazachstania genus, were dominant in 54% of sourdoughs. Bread making practices were found to drive the distribution of fungal species across sourdoughs. The most striking bread making practice effect was the occurrence of Kazachstania humilis in sourdoughs made with artisanal-like practices and the occurrence of Kazachstania bulderi in sourdoughs made with farmer-like practices. Phenotypic divergences between sourdough and nonsourdough strains were found for K. humilis but not for K. bulderi. Overall, our results showed that preserving bread making practice diversity allows the preservation of a higher species and phenotypic diversity in microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive plasticity allows populations to cope with environmental variation but is expected to fail as conditions become unfamiliar. In novel conditions, populations may instead rely on rapid adaptation to increase fitness and avoid extinction. Adaptation should be fastest when both plasticity and selection occur in directions of the multivariate phenotype that contain abundant genetic variation. However, tests of this prediction from field experiments are rare. Here, we quantify how additive genetic variance in a multivariate phenotype changes across an elevational gradient, and test whether plasticity and selection align with genetic variation. We do so using two closely related, but ecologically distinct, sister species of Sicilian daisy (Senecio, Asteraceae) adapted to high and low elevations on Mount Etna. Using a paternal half-sibling breeding design, we generated and then reciprocally planted c.19,000 seeds of both species, across an elevational gradient spanning each species native elevation, and then quantified mortality and five leaf traits of emergent seedlings. We found that genetic variance in leaf traits changed more across elevations than between species. The high-elevation species at novel lower elevations showed changes in the distribution of genetic variance among the leaf traits, which reduced the amount of genetic variance in the directions of selection and the native phenotype. By contrast, the low-elevation species mainly showed changes in the amount of genetic variance at the novel high elevation, and genetic variance was concentrated in the direction of the native phenotype. For both species, leaf trait plasticity across elevations was in a direction of the multivariate phenotype that contained a moderate amount of genetic variance. Together, these data suggest that where plasticity is adaptive, selection on genetic variance for an initially plastic response could promote adaptation. However, large environmental effects on genetic variance are likely to reduce adaptive potential in novel environments.",

    "abstract": "The brain actively reshapes our understanding of past events in light of new incoming information. In the current study, we ask how the brain supports this updating process during the encoding and recall of naturalistic stimuli. One group of participants watched a movie (\"The Sixth Sense\") with a cinematic \"twist\" at the end that dramatically changed the interpretation of previous events. Next, participants were asked to verbally recall the movie events, taking into account the new \"twist\" information. Most participants updated their recall to incorporate the twist. Two additional groups recalled the movie without having to update their memories during recall: one group never saw the twist; another group was exposed to the twist prior to the beginning of the movie, and thus the twist information was incorporated both during encoding and recall. We found that providing participants with information about the twist beforehand altered neural response patterns during movie-viewing in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, presenting participants with the twist at the end of the movie changed the neural representation of the previously-encoded information during recall in a subset of DMN regions. Further evidence for this transformation was obtained by comparing the neural activation patterns during encoding and recall and correlating them with behavioral signatures of memory updating. Our results demonstrate that neural representations of past events encoded in the DMN are dynamically integrated with new information that reshapes our understanding in natural contexts.",

    "abstract": "Cancer and highly proliferating normal cells have high demand for energy but paradoxically switch energy production from the highly efficient mitochondrial respiration to the low efficient cytosolic glycolysis. This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect, but the reason for which is not fully understood. This study found that low intracellular pH (pHi) induced apoptosis, whereas high pHi enhanced proliferation, of normal lymphocytes. In tumor cells, low pHi also induced apoptosis whereas high pHi maintained high rates of proliferation. In the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) of mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin, lymphocytes had dramatically higher and more heterogeneous pHi values than lymphocytes in the non-draining lymph nodes. The pHi values of the lymphocytes were inversely related to mitochondrial energetic activities, and the rise of the lymphocyte pHi in the MLNs was accompanied by the reduction of mitochondrial energetic activities. Furthermore, high lymphocyte proliferation in the MLNs powered by strong mitochondrial energy led to low pHi thereby predestined the lymphocytes to death by apoptosis, thus prevented such cells from accumulating in the MLNs. Since unlike mitochondrial respiration, the Warburg effect does not increase protons in the cells, these findings support a proposed explanation for the Warburg effect as a substitution for mitochondrial respiration that allows the highly proliferating cells to avoid low pHi-induced apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Salt taste sensation is multifaceted: NaCl at low or high concentrations is preferably or aversively perceived through distinct pathways. Cl- is thought to participate in taste sensation through an unknown mechanism. Here we describe Cl- ion binding and the response of taste receptor type 1 (T1r), a receptor family composing sweet/umami receptors. The T1r2a/T1r3 heterodimer from the medaka fish, currently the sole T1r amenable to structural analyses, exhibited a specific Cl- binding in the vicinity of the amino-acid-binding site in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of T1r3, which is likely conserved across species, including human T1r3. The Cl- binding induced a conformational change in T1r2a/T1r3LBD at sub-to low-mM concentrations similar to canonical taste substances. Furthermore, oral Cl- application to mice increased impulse frequencies of taste nerves connected to T1r-expressing taste cells and promoted their behavioral preferences attenuated by a T1r-specific blocker or T1r3 knock-out. These results suggest that the Cl- evokes taste sensations by binding to T1r, thereby serving as another preferred salt taste pathway at a low concentration.",

Mutations in two genes encoding synaptically enriched clathrin-uncoating factors, synaptojanin 1 (SJ1) and auxilin, have been implicated in atypical Parkinsonism. SJ1 knock-in (SJ1-KIRQ) mice carrying a disease-linked mutation display neurological manifestations reminiscent of Parkinsonism. Here we report that auxilin knockout (Aux-KO) mice display dystrophic changes of a subset of nigrostriatal DAergic terminals similar to those of SJ1-KIRQ mice. Furthermore, Aux-KO/SJ1-KIRQ double mutant mice have shorter lifespan and more severe synaptic defects than single mutant mice. These include increase in dystrophic striatal nerve terminals positive for DAergic markers and for the PD risk protein SV2C, as well as adaptive changes in striatal interneurons. The synergistic effect of the two mutations demonstrates a special lability of DAergic neurons to defects in clathrin uncoating, with implications for PD pathogenesis in at least some forms of this condition.",

They thus open the possibility for generating novel sequences belonging to protein families. Protein language models trained on multiple sequence alignments, such as MSA Transformer, are highly attractive candidates to this end. We propose and test an iterative method that directly employs the masked language modeling objective to generate sequences using MSA Transformer. We demonstrate that the resulting sequences score as well as natural sequences, for homology, coevolution and structure-based measures. For large protein families, our synthetic sequences have similar or better properties compared to sequences generated by Potts models, including experimentally-validated ones. Moreover, for small protein families, our generation method based on MSA Transformer outperforms Potts models. Our method also more accurately reproduces the higher-order statistics and the distribution of sequences in sequence space of natural data than Potts models. MSA Transformer is thus a strong candidate for protein sequence generation and protein design.",

We performed deep mutational scanning on three essential E. coli proteins (FabZ, LpxC and MurA) involved in cell envelope synthesis using high-throughput CRISPR genome editing. This allowed us to study the effect of the introduced mutations in their original genomic context. Using more than 17,000 variants of FabZ, LpxC and MurA from the saturation editing libraries constructed here, we have interrogated protein function and the importance of individual amino acids in supporting viability. Additionally, we have exploited these libraries to study resistance development against antimicrobial compounds that target the selected proteins. Our results show that, among the three proteins studied, MurA is the superior antimicrobial target due to its low mutational flexibility which decreases the chance of acquiring resistance-conferring mutations that simultaneously preserve MurA function. Additionally, we were able to rank anti-LpxC lead compounds for further development guided by the number of resistance-conferring mutations against each compound. Our results show that deep mutational scanning studies can be used to guide drug development, which we hope will contribute towards the development of urgently needed novel antimicrobial therapies.",

We previously showed that male knock-in mice carrying the mouse Methionine homolog (Met68BDNF) exhibit excessive and compulsive alcohol drinking behaviors as compared to the wild-type Val68BDNF mice. Here, we set out to determine the potential mechanism for the heightened and compulsive alcohol drinking phenotypes detected in Met68BDNF mice. We found that male, but not female Met68BDNF mice exhibit social anxiety-like behaviors. We further show that male Met68BDNF mice exhibit a preference for alcohol over social interaction. In contrast, alcohol place preference without an alternative social reward, is similar in male Met68BDNF and Val68BDNF mice. Since the Met68BDNF mice show social anxiety phenotypes, we tested whether alcohol reliefs anxiety similarly in Met68BDNF and Val68BDNF mice and found that male, but not female Met68BDNF mice are insensitive to the acute anxiolytic action of alcohol. Finally, we show that this acute tolerance to alcohol-dependent anxiolysis can be restored by overexpressing wild-type Val68BDNF in the ventral hippocampus (vHC) of Met68BDNF mice. Together, our results suggest that excessive alcohol drinking in the Met68BDNF may be attributed, in part, to heighted social anxiety and a lack of alcohol-dependent anxiolysis, a phenotype that is associated with malfunction of BDNF signaling in the vHC of male Met68BDNF mice.",

    "abstract": "Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate marked behavioral improvements during febrile episodes, in what is perhaps the only present-day means of modulating the core ASD phenotype. Understanding the nature of this so-called fever effect is therefore essential for leveraging this natural temporary relief of symptoms to a sustained efficacious intervention. Towards this goal, we used machine learning to analyze the rich clinical data of the Simons Simplex Collection, in which 1 out of every 6 children with ASD was reported to improve during febrile episodes, across multiple ASD domains. Reported behavioral improvements during febrile episodes were associated with maternal infection in pregnancy (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = [1.42, 2.03], P = 4.24x10-4) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction (OR=1.46, 95% CI = [1.15, 1.81], P = 1.94x10-3). Family members of children reported to improve when febrile have an increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders (OR=1.43, 95% CI = [1.23, 1.67], P = 3.0x10-6), language disorders (OR=1.63, 95% CI = [1.29, 2.04], P = 2.5x10-5), and neuropsychiatric disorders (OR=1.59, 95% CI = [1.34, 1.89], P < 1x10-6). Since both GI abnormalities and maternal immune activation have been linked to ASD via proinflammatory cytokines, these results might suggest a possible involvement of immune dysregulation in the fever effect, consistent with findings in mouse models. This work advances our understanding of the fever-responsive ASD subtype and motivates future studies to directly test the link between proinflammatory cytokines and behavioral modifications in individuals with ASD.\n\nLay summarySome individuals with ASD demonstrate marked behavioral improvements when they have a fever. However, the magnitude, scope, nature, and underlying neurobiological basis of the so-called fever effect remain unknown. This large-scale biomedical data analysis found that children with ASD reported to improve when febrile tend to be those with worse gastrointestinal symptoms and whose mothers reported an infection during pregnancy. These and other findings point to the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines in this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Frontiers of disease biology started recognizing the importance of systems and network medicine approach for managing chronic disease like diabetes. Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors are one such class of anti-diabetic drugs recognized for their systemic biological actions. Polyherbal preparations like Ayurveda formulations are ideal for identifying novel DPP4 inhibitors having greater efficacy and safety profile. Additionally, expanding the research on the multitargeted mode of action of these polyherbal formulations can render novel insights into the complex biology of disease manifestations. The current study aims at identifying DPP4 inhibitory potential of a clinically established Ayurveda anti-diabetic formulation Nisakathakadi Kashaya (NK) using in vitro and in silico methods as well as the modulation of diabetes associated gene network by NK. a. Standard enzyme inhibition assay was used to study the DPP4 inhibitory potential of NK, followed by bioinformatics and computational biology tools for identifying the potential bioactives and their molecular interactions involved in DPP4 inhibition. STITCH, CHEMBL and BindingDB databases were used for target mapping and depicting the multi-targeted network pharmacology interaction of NK and the formulation. EnrichR was used to depict a sub-network of diabetes proteins and their relationship with diabetes associated comorbidities. NK demonstrated a dose dependent DPP4 inhibition with an IC50 of 2.06 g GAE/mL. Molecular docking identified three compounds namely Terchebin, Locaracemoside B and 1,2,4,6 Tetra o Galloyl Beta D Glucose showing stable interactions with DPP4 similar to the standard drug Vildagliptin. The network pharmacology analysis of NK identified a number of targets like TNF, TGF{beta}1, SOD1, SOD2, AKT1, DPP4 and GLP1R in its protein-protein interaction network which are vital to diabetic progression and complications. The present work demonstrated that the polyherbal formulation NK has DPP4 inhibition potential and modulates a large number of diabetes related proteins and pathways. The approach adopted in the current study by combining in vitro and in silico methods allowed us to understand the mechanism of DPP4 inhibition by the formulation and also the possible pharmacological networking through which the formulation exert its systemic effect in diabetes management.",

A total of 854 operational taxonomic units were identified. In each fish species, between 2 and 18 OTUs dominated with cumulative relative abundance [&ge;]70%. Most of the dominating bacterial taxa have been reported to occur both in wild and farmed fish populations. The midgut bacterial communities were different among the 12 fish, except for Pagrus pagrus and Pagellus erythrinus, which belong to the Sparidae family. No differentiation of the midgut bacterial microbiota was found based on feeding habits, i.e., omnivorous vs. carnivorous. Comparing wild and farmed P. pagrus midgut bacterial microbiota revealed considerable variation between them. Our results expand the gut microbiota of wild fish and support the host species effect as the more likely factor shaping intestinal bacterial microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual sensitivity often improves with training, a phenomenon known as  perceptual learning. Another important perceptual dimension is appearance, the subjective sense of stimulus magnitude. Are training-induced improvements in sensitivity accompanied by more accurate appearance? Here, we examine this question by measuring both discrimination and estimation capabilities for nearhorizontal motion perception, before and after training. Observers trained on either discrimination or estimation exhibited improved sensitivity, along with increases in already-large estimation biases away from horizontal. To explain this counterintuitive finding, we developed a computational observer model in which perceptual learning arises from changes in the precision of underlying neural representations. For each observer, the fitted model accounted for both discrimination performance and the distribution of estimates, and their changes after training. Our empirical findings and modeling suggest that learning enhances distinctions between categories, a potentially important aspect of real-world perception and perceptual learning.",

    "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopamine system is an evolutionarily conserved set of brain circuits that plays a role in attention, appetitive behavior, and reward processing. In this circuitry, ascending dopaminergic projections from the ventral midbrain innervate targets throughout the limbic forebrain, such as the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dopaminergic signaling in the NAc has been widely studied for its role in behavioral reinforcement, reward prediction error encoding, and motivational salience. Less well characterized is the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the response to surprising or alerting sensory events. To address this, we used the genetically encoded dopamine sensor dLight1 and fiber photometry to explore the ability of striatal dopamine release in to encode the properties of salient sensory stimuli in mice, such as threatening looming discs. Here, we report that NAc lateral shell (LNAc) dopamine release encodes the rate and magnitude of environmental luminance changes rather than visual stimulus threat level. This encoding is highly sensitive, as LNAc dopamine could be evoked by light intensities that were imperceptible to human experimenters. We also found that light-evoked dopamine responses are wavelength-dependent at low irradiances, independent of the circadian cycle, robust to previous exposure history, and involve multiple phototransduction pathways. Thus, we have further elaborated the mesolimbic dopamine systems ability to encode visual information in mice, which is likely relevant to a wide body of scientists employing light sources or optical methods in behavioral research involving rodents.",

Polygenic scores and machine learning models have been developed for disease prediction based on genetic variants and other risk factors. However, over 80% of existing genomic data were acquired from individuals of European descent. As a result, clinico-genomic risk prediction is less accurate for non-European populations. Here we employ a transfer learning strategy to improve the clinico-genomic prediction of disease occurrence for the data-disadvantaged populations. Our multi-ancestral machine learning experiments on clinico-genomic datasets of cancers and Alzheimers disease and synthetic datasets with built-in data inequality and subpopulation shift show that transfer learning can significantly improve disease prediction accuracy for data-disadvantaged populations. Under the transfer learning scheme, the prediction accuracy for the data-disadvantaged populations can be improved without compromising the prediction accuracy for other populations. Therefore, transfer learning provides a Pareto improvement toward equitable machine learning for genomic medicine.",

Then we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) PPLMs on 2279 protein variants across 20 cancer-related genes. Our empirical results show that the PPLMs outperform the SOTA baseline, EVE [1], trained on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data.

The neural origins of these impairments are thought to reside in cortical circuits4-6, affecting perception and decision-making3. Here we demonstrate that efficient and timely responses to visual threats are disrupted across ASD mouse models, despite differences in their underlying molecular mechanisms. These delays in perceptual decision-making (PDM) to visual threats are due to cognitive, not sensory or motor impairments and are linked to reduced fear memory. Optogenetic perturbation and electrophysiological experiments revealed a potassium-channel mediated hypoexcitability phenotype in a subcortical node, the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG). In vivo pharmacological rescue of dPAG hypoexcitability reverses both delayed PDM and fear memory, emphasising the role of timely perception in ASDs and learning in general. Our work underscores the significance of perception and subcortical pathways in ASD, providing a behavioural biomarker to bridge molecules, circuits and behaviour.",

Empirical methods have been developed to direct the evolution of phages to attack new strains, but the methods have not been evaluated or compared for their consequences. In particular, how do different methods favor generalist (broad host range) phages over specialist phages? All methods involve exposing phages to two or more novel bacterial strains, but the methods differ in the order in which those hosts are presented through time: Parallel presentation, Sequential presentation, and Mixed presentation.\n\nMethodsWe use a combination of simple analytical methods and numerical analyses to study the effect of these different protocols on the selection of generalist versus specialist phages.\n\nResultsThe three presentation protocols have profoundly different consequences for the evolution of generalist versus specialist phages. Sequential presentation favors generalist almost to the exclusion of specialists, whereas Parallel presentation does the least so. However, other protocol attributes (e.g. the nature of dilution between transfers of phages to new cultures) also have effects on selection and phage maintenance. It is also noted that protocols can be designed to enhance recombination to augment evolution and to reduce stochastic loss of newly-arisen mutants.",

    "abstract": "SummaryMitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles that serve as hubs for aerobic energy metabolism. The biogenesis of the respiratory (OXPHOS) system relies on nuclear-encoded factors, which regulate the transcription, processing and translation of mitochondrial (mt)RNAs. These include proteins of primordial origin, as well as eukaryotic-type RNA-binding families recruited from the host genomes to function in mitogenome expression. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins constitute a major gene-family in angiosperms that is pivotal in many aspects of mtRNA metabolism, such as editing, splicing or stability. Here, we report the analysis of MITOCHONDRIA STABILITY/PROCESSING PPR FACTOR1 (MSP1, At4g20090), a canonical mitochondria-localized PPR protein that is necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis and embryo-development. Functional complementation confirmed that the phenotypes result from a disruption of the MSP1 gene. As a loss-of-function allele of Arabidopsis MSP1 leads to seed abortion, we employed an embryo-rescue method for the molecular characterization of msp1 mutants. Our data show that msp1 embryo-development fails to proceed beyond the heart-torpedo transition stage as a consequence of a severe nad1 pre-RNA processing-defect, resulting in the loss of respiratory complex I (CI) activity. The maturation of nad1 involves the processing of three RNA-fragments, nad1.1, nad1.2 and nad1.3. Based on biochemical analyses and the mtRNA profiles in wild-type and msp1 plants, we concluded that through its association with a specific site in nad1.1, MSP1 facilitates the generation of its 3-terminus and stabilizes it -a prerequisite for nad1 exons a-b splicing. Our data substantiate the importance of mtRNA metabolism for the biogenesis of the respiratory machinery during early-plant development.",

    "abstract": "Anuran metamorphosis is characterized by profound morphological changes including remodeling of tissues and organs. This transition is initiated by thyroid hormones (THs). However, the current knowledge of changing levels of THs during metamorphosis relies on pooled samples using methods known for high variability with sparse reporting of measured variation. Moreover, establishing a clear linkage between key gene expression bioindicators and TH levels throughout the metamorphic process is needed. Using state-of-the-art ultra-high performance liquid chromatography isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry, we targeted 12 THs and metabolites in the serum of Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana (n=5-10) across seven distinct postembryonic stages beginning with premetamorphic tadpoles (Gosner stage 31-33) and continuing through metamorphosis to a juvenile frog (Gosner stage 46). TH levels were related to TH-relevant gene transcripts (thra, thrb, and thibz) in back skin of the same individual animals. Significant increases from basal levels were observed for thyroxine (T4) and 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3) at Gosner stage 41, reaching maximal levels at Gosner stage 44 (28{+/-}10 and 2.3{+/-}0.5 ng/mL, respectively), and decreasing to basal levels in juvenile frogs. In contrast, 3,5-diiodothyronine (T2) increased significantly at Gosner stage 40 and was maintained elevated until stage 44. While thra transcript levels remained constant and then decreased at the end of metamorphic climax, thrb and thibz were induced to maximal levels at Gosner stage 41, followed by a decrease to basal levels in the froglet. This exemplifies the exquisite timing of events during metamorphosis as classic early response genes are transcribed in anticipation of peak TH concentrations. The distinct T2 concentration profile suggests a biological role of this biomolecule in anuran postembryonic development and an additional aspect that may be a target of anthropogenic chemicals that can disrupt anuran metamorphosis and TH signalling. Hence, as a second aim of the study, we set out to find additional bioindicators of metamorphosis, which can aid future investigations of developmental disruption. Using a sensitive nanoLC-Orbitrap system an untargeted analysis workflow was applied. Among 6,062 endogenous metabolites, 421 showed metamorphosis-dependent concentration dynamics. These potential bioindicators included several carnitines, prostaglandins and some steroid hormones.",

    "abstract": "Despite the breakthrough achievements in understanding structural and functional connectivity alterations that underlie autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the exact nature and type of such alterations are not yet clear due to conflicting reports of hyper-connectivity, hypo-connectivity, and -in some cases- combinations of both. In this work, we approach the debate about hyper- vs hypoconnectivity in ASD using a novel network comparison technique designed to capture mesoscopic-scale differential structures. In particular, we build on recent algorithmic advances in the sparsification of functional connectivity matrices, in the extraction of contrast subgraphs, and in the computation of statistically significant maximal frequent itemsets, and develop a method to identify mesoscale structural subgraphs that are maximally dense and different in terms of connectivity levels between the different sets of networks.\n\nWe apply our method to analyse brain networks of typically developed individuals and ASD patients across different developmental phases and find a set of altered cortical-subcortical circuits between healthy subjects and patients affected by ASD. Specifically, our analysis highlights in ASD patients a significantly larger number of functional connections among regions of the occipital cortex and between the left precuneus and the superior parietal gyrus. At the same time, reduced connectivity characterised the superior frontal gyrus and the temporal lobe regions. More importantly, we can simultaneously detect regions of the brain that show hyper and hypo-connectivity in ASD in children and adolescents, recapitulating within a single framework multiple previous separate observations.",

    "abstract": "Remote enhancers are thought to interact with their target promoters via physical proximity, yet the importance of this proximity for enhancer function remains unclear. Although some enhancer-promoter loops are cell-type-specific, others are stable across tissues or even display reduced physical proximity upon activation. A major challenge is that relatively few enhancers are functionally characterized in vivo, making it difficult to draw generalized conclusions about enhancer-promoter looping during developmental gene activation. Here, we investigate the 3D conformation of enhancers during mammalian development by generating high-resolution tissue-resolved contact maps for nearly a thousand mammalian enhancers with known in vivo activities in ten murine embryonic tissues. We performed enhancer knockouts in mice, which validated newly identified enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. The majority of enhancers display tissue-specific 3D conformations, and both enhancer-promoter and enhancer-enhancer interactions are significantly stronger upon enhancer activation in vivo. Less than 14% of enhancer-promoter interactions form stably across tissues; however, corresponding enhancers still display highly-tissue-specific activities indicating that their activity is uncoupled from a chromatin interaction with promoters. We find that these invariant interactions form in the absence of the enhancer and are mediated by adjacent CTCF binding. We also identified putative in vivo target genes for enhancers linked to congenital malformations, neurodevelopmental disorders, and autism, demonstrating the utility of our dataset for understanding human congenital disorders. Our results highlight the general significance of enhancer-promoter physical proximity for developmental gene activation in mammals.",

However, our knowledge about marmoset vocalisations predominantly originates from playback studies or vocal interactions between dyads, and there is a need to move towards studying group-level communication dynamics. Efficient source identification from marmoset vocalisations is essential for this challenge, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can aid it. Here we built a pipeline capable of plentiful feature extraction, meaningful feature selection, and supervised classification of vocalisations of up to 18 marmosets. We optimised the classifier by building a hierarchical MLA that first learned to determine the sex of the source, narrowed down the possible source individuals based on their sex, and then determined the source identity. We were able to correctly identify the source individual with high precisions (87.21% - 94.42%, depending on call type, and up to 97.79% after the removal of twins from the dataset). We also examine the robustness of identification across varying sample sizes. Our pipeline is a promising tool not only for source identification from marmoset vocalisations but also for analysing vocalisations and tracking vocal learning trajectories of other species.",

Using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, Co2+ can act as both stimulator and inhibitor of K+-phosphatase activity. Without Mg2+, Co2+ stimulates K+-phosphatase activity similarly but with a {approx}4.5-fold greater affinity than with Mg2+. With Mg2+, K+-phosphatase activity is almost completely inhibited by Co2+. Substitution of Mg2+ by Co2+ slightly increases enzyme affinity for K+ and NH4+. Independently of Mg2+, ouabain inhibition is unaffected by Co2+. Mg2+ displaces bound Co2+ from the Mg2+-binding site in a concentration dependent mechanism.

Saturation by Co2+ of the Mg2+ binding site does not affect pNPP recognition by the enzyme.

    "abstract": "Plants use light energy to produce ATP and redox equivalents for metabolism. Since during the course of a day plants are exposed to constantly fluctuating light, the supply of ATP and redox equivalents is also fluctuating. Further, if the metabolism cannot use all of the supplied energy, the excess absorbed energy can damage the plant in the form of reactive oxygen species. It is thus reasonable to assume that the metabolism downstream of the energy supply is dynamic and as being capable of dampening sudden spikes in supply is advantageous, it is further reasonable to assume that the immediate downstream metabolism is flexible as well. A flexible metabolism exposed to a fluctuating input is unlikely to be in metabolic steady-state, yet a lot of mathematical models for carbon fixation assume one for the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Here we present an analysis of the validity of this assumption by progressively simplifying an existing model of photosynthesis and carbon fixation.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) is characterized by compulsion-like alcohol drinking (CLAD), and this intake despite negative consequences can be a major clinical obstacle. With the quite limited treatment options available for AUD, there is a significant and critical unmet need for novel therapies. The noradrenergic system is an important hub for the stress response as well as maladaptive drives for alcohol, and pre-clinical (including our own) and clinical studies have shown that drugs targeting the 1 adrenenergic receptors (ARs) may represent a pharmacological treatment for pathological drinking. However, the involvement of {beta} ARs for treating human drinking AUD has received somewhat scant investigation, and we sought to provide pre-clinical validation for possible AR utility for CLAD. Thus, we first examined whether {beta} AR antagonist propranolol, betaxolol ({beta}1), and ICI, 118 551 ({beta}2) impacted compulsion-like intake and alcohol-only drinking (AOD) in male Wistar rats through systemic injections. The systemic highest dose of propranolol (10mg/kg) reduced both AOD and CLAD. 5mg/kg propranolol affected CLAD more than AOD, with no effects of 2.5mg/kg. Similar to propranolol, betaxolol also only decreased CLAD at the lower dose (2.5mg/kg). ICI 118.551 had no effects, suggesting propranolol regulates alcohol intake through {beta}1. Also, while AR compounds might have utility for AUD, these compounds can also lead to undesirable cardiovascular system side effects; thus, any strategy incorporating lower doses of these compounds to reduce drinking could have broad utility. Importantly, here we found that a combination of ineffective doses of propranolol and prazosin administrated together did reduce both CLAD and AOD. Finally, we investigated the effect of propranolol and betaxolol into two brain areas related to pathological drinking, the anterior insula (aINS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Surprisingly, propranolol (1-10g) in aINS or mPFC did not affect CLAD or AOD (although with a trend for aINS betaxolol to impact CLAD), suggesting propranolol regulation of alcohol drinking through a target other than aINS and mPFC. Together, our findings provide new pharmacological insights into noradrenergic regulation of alcohol consumption, which may inform AUD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy, a clinical diagnosis characterized by paroxysmal episodes known as seizures, affects 1% of people worldwide. Safe and patient-specific treatment is vital and can be achieved by the development of rapid pre-clinical models of for identified epilepsy genes. Epilepsy can result from either brain injury or gene mutations, and can also be induced chemically. Xenopus laevis tadpoles could be a useful model for confirmation of variants of unknown significance found in epilepsy patients, and for drug re-purposing screens that could eventually lead to benefits for patients. Here, we characterise and quantify seizure-related behaviours in X. laevis tadpoles arrayed in 24-well plates. To provoke acute seizure behaviours, tadpoles were chemically induced with either pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). To test the capacity to adapt this method for drug testing, we also exposed induced tadpoles to the anti-seizure drug valproate (VPA). Four induced seizure-like behaviours were described and manually quantified, and two of these (darting, circling) could be accurately detected automatically, using the video analysis software TopScan. Additionally, we recorded swimming trajectories and mean swimming velocity. Automatic detection showed that either PTZ or 4-AP induced darting behaviour and increased mean swimming velocity compared to untreated controls. Both parameters were significantly reduced in the presence of VPA. In particular, darting behaviour was a shown to be a sensitive measure of epileptic seizure activity. While we could not automatically detect the full range of seizure behaviours, this method shows promise for future studies, since X. laevis is a well-characterised and genetically tractable model organism.",

    "abstract": "Clinical studies have revealed a high comorbidity between autoimmune and psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the mechanisms connecting autoimmunity and depression remain unclear. Here, we aim to identify the processes linking adaptive immune abnormalities and depression. To examine this relationship, we analyzed antibody responses and autoimmunity in the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model in mice, and in clinical samples from patients with MDD. We show that socially stressed mice have elevated serum antibody concentrations. Activation of social stress-induced antibody responses were confirmed by detecting expansion of specific T and B cell populations particularly in the cervical lymph nodes, where brain-derived antigens are preferentially delivered. IgG antibody concentrations in the brain were significantly higher in stress-susceptible mice than in unstressed mice, and positively correlated with social avoidance. IgG antibodies accumulated around the blood vessels in brain sections from stress-susceptible mice. Moreover, sera from stress-susceptible mice exhibited high reactivity against brain tissue, and brain-reactive IgG antibody levels positively correlated with depression-like behavior. Similarly, in humans, increased peripheral levels of brain-reactive IgG antibodies were associated with increased anhedonia. Furthermore, high stress-resilience was observed in B cell-depleted mice, confirming a causal link between antibody-producing cells and depression-like behavior. This study provides novel mechanistic insights connecting stress-induced autoimmune reactions against the brain and stress susceptibility. Therapeutic strategies targeting autoimmune responses can therefore be devised to treat patients with MDD featuring immune abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "The Type VI secretion System (T6SS) is a versatile weapon used by bacteria for virulence, resistance to grazing and competition with other bacteria. We previously demonstrated that the role of the T6SS in interbacterial competition and in resistance to grazing is enhanced in Vibrio cholerae in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of polymyxin B (PmB). In this study, we performed a global quantitative proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and a transcriptomic analysis by quantitative PCR of the T6SS known regulators in V. cholerae grown with and without PmB. The proteome of V. cholerae is greatly modified in the presence of PmB at subinhibitory concentrations with more than 39 % of the identified cellular proteins displaying a difference in their abundance, including T6SS-related proteins (Hcp, VasC, TsaB and ClpV). We identified a regulator whose abundance and expression are increased in the presence of PmB, vxrB, the response regulator of the two-component system VxrAB. In a vxrAB deficient mutant, the expression of hcp measured by quantitative PCR, although globally reduced, was not modified in the presence of PmB, confirming its role in hcp upregulation with PmB. The upregulation of the T6SS in the presence of PmB appears to be, at least in part, due to the two-component system VxrAB.\n\nImportanceThe type VI secretion system is important for bacterial competition, virulence and resistance to grazing by predators. In this study, we investigated the regulation leading to the type VI secretion system activation in the presence of polymyxin B (PmB), an antimicrobial used in veterinary and human health to treat infection caused by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, in V. cholerae. In addition to making an overall portrait of the modifications to the proteome, we identified the VxrAB two-component system as the main regulator responsible for this activation. Our results provide evidence that subinhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials are responsible for important modifications of the proteome of pathogenic bacteria, inducing the production of proteins involved in virulence, host colonisation, resistance and environmental survival.",

Here, using high content data describing features of cell migration and morphology, we determine the sources of variability across different scales, including between laboratories, persons, experiments, technical repeats, cells and time points. Significant technical variability occurred between laboratories, providing low value to direct meta-analysis on the data from different laboratories.

Most studies tend to assess the recovery of one component of the community at a time but here we use DNA metabarcoding to simultaneously monitor soil bacteria, fungi, and arthropods along an 85-year chronosequence following wildfire in jack pine-dominated ecosites. We describe soil successional and community assembly processes to better inform sustainable forest management practices. Soil taxa showed different recovery trajectories following wildfire. Bacteria shared a large core community across stand development stages (~ 95-97% of their unique sequences) and appeared to recover relatively quickly by crown closure. By comparison fungi and arthropods shared smaller core communities (64-77% and 68-69%, respectively) and each stage appeared to support unique biodiversity. We show the importance of maintaining a mosaic ecosystem that represents each stand development stage to maintain the full suite of biodiversity in soils following wildfire, especially for fungi and arthropods. These results will provide a useful baseline for comparison when assessing the effects of human disturbance such as harvest or for assessing the effects of more frequent wildfire events due to climate change.",

Then a specific SWTU prototype was designed and built from this kinetic model. A 370-day experiment demonstrated that SWTU maintained normal operation with robust stability and desired dynamic behaviors, and effectively disposed the solid waste. Therefore, this kinetic model was highly valid due to its high structural and behavioral similarity with the prototype. This research could lay a strong theoretical foundation for further closed-loop control and optimization of SWTU, and provide scientific guidance to environmental management and sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic diversification and speciation are classically associated with genetic differentiation and gene expression variation. However, increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation may contribute to species divergence due to their effects on transcription and phenotype. Methylation can also increase mutagenesis and could lead to genetic assimilation of plastic phenotypes into genetic variants when the environment remains stable over many generations, though there has been minimal empirical research on assimilation. Whitefish are excellent systems to study speciation and genetic assimilation due to the repeated independent divergence of benthic-limnetic species pairs that have coexisted in lakes for ~12 000 years serving as natural replicates. Here we investigate whole genome genetic and epigenetic differentiation between benthic-limnetic species pairs in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and European whitefish (C. lavaretus) from four lakes (N=64). We found considerable, albeit variable, genetic and epigenetic differences between benthic and limnetic species in all four lakes. Polymorphism was enriched at CpG sites confirming the mutagenic nature of DNA methylation; all SNP types were enriched in all lakes, though C > T SNPs were most common. We also identified a surplus of potential sites undergoing genetic assimilation putatively associated with speciation, defined as sites harbouring both a differentially methylated site and a highly divergent SNP. Our results support the hypothesis that DNA methylation contributes to phenotypic divergence, influences mutagenesis, and drives genetic assimilation of phenotypes that are ultimately associated with ecological speciation in whitefish species complexes.",

For NS, R2 varied from 0.08 (LT) to 0.70 (DPM). Overall, 68 significant (p < 10-03) marker-trait associations (MTAs) and 22 putative candidate genes were identified across DS and NS conditions. Most of the identified genes had known biological functions related to regulating the response to moisture stress. The findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of moisture stress tolerance in common bean. The findings also provide potential candidate SNPs and putative genes that can be utilized in gene discovery and marker-assisted breeding for drought tolerance after validation.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing recognition that cells may activate apoptotic caspases but not die, instead displaying various physiologically relevant consequences. We know very little, however, of the mechanisms that underlie the life/death decision in a cell that has activated apoptotic caspases. By optimizing a published reporter for past caspase activity, we were able to visualize cells that survived caspase activation specifically after exposure to ionizing radiation in Drosophila larval wing discs. We found that cells with X-ray-induced past active caspases (XPAC) do not arise at random but are born at specific locations within the developing wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae. We found also that the apoptotic signaling pathway is needed to induce XPAC cells. Yet, XPAC cells appear in stereotypical patterns that do not follow the pattern of IR-induced apoptosis, suggesting additional controls at play. Functional testing identified the contribution of wingless (Drosophila Wnt1) and Ras signaling to the prevalence of XPAC cells. By following irradiated larvae into adulthood, we found that XPAC cells contribute to the adult wing. To address the relationship between XPAC and genome stability, we combined a reporter for past caspase activity with mwh, an adult marker for Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). We found a lower incidence of LOH among XPAC compared to cells that did not activate the reporter for past caspase activity. In addition, at time points when wing disc cells are finishing DNA repair, XPAC cells show an anti-correlation with cells with unrepaired IR-induced double-stranded breaks. Our data suggest that non-lethal caspase activity safeguards the genome by facilitating DNA repair and reducing LOH after transient exposure to X-rays. These results identify a physiological role for non-lethal caspase activity during recovery from radiation damage.",

    "abstract": "We are working toward a complete functional and genomic characterization of the cannabinoid synthase family in Cannabis (itself part of the larger Berberine Bridge Enzyme family). This clade, which is unique to Cannabis, includes four main subclades that appear to have arisen by a series of gene duplications. We have functionally characterized three cannabinoid synthases, in addition to the three already characterized, so that now all four subclades contain at least one characterized enzyme. The previously uncharacterized Clade C enzymes have relatively low activity and produce CBCA as their primary product. In addition, we report genomic characterization to better understand the structure and high level of copy number variation in this family. We report a pattern of shared regions immediately upstream of the cannabinoid synthase genes that suggests a specific sequence of breakpoints, and hence gene duplication events. We present a model of gene family expansion to account for the observed data, along with evidence that this expansion occurred under selective pressure. This work adds to our understanding of both the high level of variability in this family and the origin of THCA in type III plants lacking a functional THCAS gene.",

    "abstract": "Healing wounds and cancers present remarkable cellular and molecular parallels, but the specific roles of the healing phases are largely unknown. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify genes and pathways that define distinct phases across the time course of healing. Their comparison to cancer transcriptomes revealed that a resolution-phase wound signature is associated with increased severity in skin cancer and enriches for extracellular matrix-related pathways. Comparisons of transcriptomes of early- and late-phase wound fibroblasts vs skin cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) identified an \"early-wound\" CAF subtype, which localizes to the inner tumor stroma and expresses collagen-related genes that are controlled by the RUNX2 transcription factor. A \"late-wound\" CAF subtype localizes to the outer tumor stroma and expresses elastin-related genes. Matrix imaging of primary melanoma tissue microarrays validated these matrix signatures and identified collagen- vs elastin-rich niches within the tumor microenvironment, whose spatial organization predicts survival and recurrence. These results identify wound-regulated genes and matrix patterns with prognostic potential in skin cancer.",

    "abstract": "Sclera collagen fiber microstructure and mechanical behavior are central to eye physiology and pathology. They are also complex, and are therefore often studied using modeling. Most models of sclera, however, have been built within a conventional continuum framework. In this framework, collagen fibers are incorporated as statistical distributions of fiber characteristics such as the orientation of a family of fibers. The conventional continuum approach, while proven successful for describing the macroscale behavior of the sclera, does not account for the sclera fibers are long, interwoven and interact with one another. Hence, by not considering these potentially crucial characteristics, the conventional approach has only a limited ability to capture and describe sclera structure and mechanics at smaller, fiber-level, scales. Recent advances in the tools for characterizing sclera microarchitecture and mechanics bring to the forefront the need to develop more advanced modeling techniques that can incorporate and take advantage of the newly available highly detailed information. Our goal was to create a new computational modeling approach that can represent the sclera fibrous microstructure more accurately than with the conventional continuum approach, while still capturing its macroscale behavior. In this manuscript we introduce the new modeling approach, that we call direct fiber modeling, in which the collagen architecture is built explicitly by long, continuous, interwoven fibers. The fibers are embedded in a continuum matrix representing the non-fibrous tissue components. We demonstrate the approach by doing direct fiber modeling of a rectangular patch of posterior sclera. The model integrated fiber orientations obtained by polarized light microscopy from coronal and sagittal cryosections of pig and sheep. The fibers were modeled using a Mooney- Rivlin model, and the matrix using a Neo-Hookean model. The fiber parameters were determined by inversely matching experimental equi-biaxial tensile data from the literature. After reconstruction, the direct fiber model orientations agreed well with the microscopy data both in the coronal plane (adjusted R2=0.8234) and in the sagittal plane (adjusted R2=0.8495) of the sclera. With the estimated fiber properties (C10=5746.9 MPa; C01=-5002.6MPa, matrix shear modulus 200kPa), the models stress-strain curves simultaneously fit the experimental data in radial and circumferential directions (adjusted R2s 0.9971 and 0.9508, respectively). The estimated fiber elastic modulus at 2.16% strain was 5.45GPa, in reasonable agreement with the literature. During stretch, the model exhibited stresses and strains at sub-fiber level, with interactions among individual fibers which are not accounted for by the conventional continuum methods. Our results demonstrate that direct fiber models can simultaneously describe the macroscale mechanics and microarchitecture of the sclera, and therefore that the approach can provide unique insight into tissue behavior questions inaccessible with continuum approaches.\n\nHighlightsCollagen fibers are the main load-bearing component of eye tissues.\n\nConventional sclera modeling ignores that fibers are long, interwoven and interact.\n\nWe demonstrate a direct fiber model with long, interwoven and interacting fibers.\n\nCollagen fiber mechanical properties were estimated using inverse fitting.\n\nThe model captures simultaneously sclera fiber structure and macroscale mechanics.",

In this work, we have developed a dual-camera structured light imaging (SLI) breast shape acquisition system tailored for a mammography-like compression setting. Illumination pattern intensity is dynamically adjusted to account for skin tone differences while thickness-informed pattern masking reduces artifacts due to specular reflections. This compact system is affixed to a rigid mount that can be installed into existing mammography or parallel-plate DOT systems without the need for camera-projector re-calibration. Our SLI system produces sub-millimeter resolution with a mean surface error of 0.26 mm. This breast shape acquisition system results in more accurate surface recovery, with an average 1.6-fold reduction in surface estimation errors over a reference method via contour extrusion. Such improvement translates to 25% to 50% reduction in mean squared error in the recovered absorption coefficient for a series of simulated tumors 1-2 cm below the skin.",

Furthermore, bioinformatically predicted emulsifier peptides from abundant potato proteins and a hydrolysate, obtained through targeted proteolysis of the extract, were investigated. During 28 days of storage at 25{degrees}C, peptides and hydrolysate exhibited better emulsifying properties and higher encapsulation efficiencies compared to native proteins and sodium caseinate. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the peroxide value (PV) and secondary volatile oxidation products between the microcapsules produced with peptides and native proteins. Microcapsules produced with peptides and hydrolysate showed the highest oxidative stability, not exceeding a PV of 10 meq/kg oil, and with concentrations of volatiles below the odor threshold in oil for five of the six studied compounds.

    "abstract": "BackgroundShotgun metagenome sequencing data obtained from a host environment will usually be contaminated with sequences from the host organism. Host sequences should be removed before further analysis to avoid biases, to reduce downstream computational load, or for privacy reasons in case of a human host. The tools that we identified as designed specifically to perform host contamination sequence removal were either outdated, not maintained or complicated to use. We have therefore created HoCoRT, a fast and user friendly tool that implements several methods for optimised host sequence removal, and evaluated the speed and accuracy of these methods.\n\nResultsHoCoRT is an open-source command-line tool for host contamination removal. It is designed to be simple to install and use, including a one-step option for genome indexing. HoCoRT uses a range of well-known mapping, classification and alignment methods for the classification of reads. The underlying classification method to be used and its parameters are selectable by the user, enabling adaptation to different circumstances. Based on our investigation of the performance of a range of methods and parameters on artificial human gut and oral microbiomes, recommendations are provided for typical data sets with short and long reads.\n\nConclusionsTo decontaminate a human microbiome with HoCoRT, the best combination of speed and accuracy was found with BioBloom, Bowtie2 in end-to-end mode, or HISAT2 for short reads, while BioBloom performed best for long reads. For the oral microbiome, Bowtie2 was slightly more accurate than the other two, at the expense of speed. HoCoRT using Bowtie2 in end-to-end mode was found to be much faster and slightly more accurate than the dedicated DeconSeq tool. HoCoRT is distributed as a Bioconda package.

    "abstract": "High-throughput \"omics\" data, including genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic data, have become increasingly produced and have contributed in recent years to the advances in cancer research. In particular, multi-modal omics data get now employed in addition to clinical data to stratify patients according to their clinical outcomes. Despite some recent work on benchmarking multi-modal integration strategies for cancer survival prediction, there is still a need for the standardization of the results of model performances and for the consecutive exploration of the relative performance of statistical and deep learning models. Here, we propose a unique benchmark, SurvBoard, which standardizes several important experimental design choices to enable comparability between cancer survival models that incorporate multi-omics data. By designing several benchmarking scenarios, SurvBoard allows for the comparison of single-cancer models and models trained on pan-cancer data; SurvBoard also makes it possible to investigate the added value of using patient data with missing modalities. Additionally, in this work, we point out several potential pitfalls that might arise during the preprocessing and validation of multi-omics cancer survival models and address them in our benchmark. We compare statistical and deep learning models revealing that statistical models often outperform deep learning models, particularly in terms of model calibration. Finally, we offer a web service that enables quick model evaluation against our benchmark (https://www.survboard.science/).

Here, we present a new software package (CAGEE) for inferring patterns of increases and decreases in gene expression across a phylogenetic tree, as well as the rate at which these changes occur. In contrast to previous methods that treat each gene independently, CAGEE can calculate genome-wide rates of gene expression, along with ancestral states for each gene. The statistical approach developed here makes it possible to infer lineage-specific shifts in rates of evolution across the genome, in addition to possible differences in rates among multiple tissues sampled from the same species. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method on simulated data, and apply it to a dataset of ovule gene expression collected from multiple self-compatible and self-incompatible species in the genus Solanum to test hypotheses about the evolutionary forces acting during mating system shifts.

    "abstract": "Prediction of tumor suppressors and oncogenes, also called driver genes, is an essential step in understanding cancer development and discovering potential novel treatments. We recently proposed Moonlight as a bioinformatics framework to predict driver genes and analyze them in a system-biology-oriented manner based on -omics integration. Moonlight uses gene expression as a primary data source and combines it with patterns related to cancer hallmarks and regulatory networks to identify oncogenic mediators. Once the oncogenic mediators are identified, it is important to include extra levels of evidence, called mechanistic indicators, to identify driver genes and to link the observed changes in gene expression to the underlying alteration that promotes them. Such a mechanistic indicator could be for example a mutation in the regulatory regions for the candidate gene or mutations in the regulator itself. In this work, we developed new functionalities and release Moonlight2, to provide the user with the mutation-based mechanistic indicator to streamline the analyses of this second layer of evidence. The function analyzes mutation information in a cancer cohort to classify them into driver and passenger mutations. Moreover, the function estimates the potential effect of a mutation on the transcriptional, translational, or protein structure/function level. Those oncogenic mediators with at least one driver mutation are retained as the final set of driver genes. We applied Moonlight2 and the newly developed function to a case study on Basal-like breast cancer subtype using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found six oncogenes (SF3B4, EBNA1BP2, KRTCAP2, ZBTB8OS, RUNX2, and POLR2J) and ten tumor suppressor genes (KIF26B, NR5A2, ARHGAP25, EMCN, ARL15, PCOLCE, TPK1, TEK, KIR2DL4, and GMFG) containing a driver mutation in their promoter region, possibly explaining their deregulation.

We find that reconstitution of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC), Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC), in different nanodisc scaffolds (MSP1E3D1, SMA, saposin, spMSP1D1) produces distinct apo and agonist-bound structures. In the presence of agonist, different nanodiscs scaffolds produce concerted conformational changes associated with activation in ELIC, with larger nanodiscs showing more activated conformations. The effect of different nanodisc scaffolds on ELIC structure extends to the extracellular domain and agonist binding site. Molecular dynamic simulations of ELIC in small and large nanodiscs suggest that the impact of the nanodisc on ELIC structure is influenced by nanodisc size. Overall, the results indicate that the nanodisc profoundly affects the structure of a pLGIC, and suggest that larger circularized nanodiscs may be advantageous to approximate a lipid membrane environment.",

    "abstract": "Methyl cellulose (MC) is a widely used material in various microfluidic applications in biology. Due to its biocompatibility, it has become a popular crowding agent for microfluidic cell deformability measurements, which usually operate at high shear rates (> 10,000 s-1). However, a full rheological characterization of methyl cellulose solutions under these conditions has not yet been reported. With this study, we provide a full shear-rheological description for solutions of up to 1% MC dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) that are commonly used in real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC). We characterized three different MC-PBS solutions used for cell mechanical measurements in RT-DC with three different shear rheometer setups to cover a range of shear rates from 0.1 - 150,000 s-1. We report viscosities and normal stress differences in this regime. Viscosity functions can be well described using a Carreau-Yasuda model. Furthermore, we present the temperature dependency of shear viscosity and first normal stress difference of these solutions. Our results show that methyl cellulose solutions behave like power-law liquids in viscosity and first normal stress difference at shear rates between 5,000 - 150,000 s-1. We construct a general viscosity equation for each MC solution at a certain shear rate and temperature. Furthermore, we investigated how MC concentration influences the rheology of the solutions and found the entanglement concentration at around 0.64 w/w%. Our results help to better understand the viscoelastic behavior of MC solutions, which can now be considered when modelling stresses in microfluidic channels.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations are associated with the activation of key pathways necessary for the initiation, progression and treatment-evasion of tumors. While large genomic studies provide the opportunity of identifying these mutations, the vast majority of variants have unclear functional roles presenting a challenge for the use of genomic studies in the clinical/therapeutic setting. Recent developments in predicting protein structures enable the systematic large-scale characterization of structures providing a link from genomic data to functional impact. Here, we observed that most oncogenic mutations tend to occur in protein regions that undergo conformation changes in the presence of the activating mutation or when interacting with a protein partner. By combining evolutionary information and protein structure prediction, we introduce the Evolutionary and Structure (ES) score, a computational approach that enables the systematic identification of hotspot somatic mutations in cancer. The predicted sites tend to occur in Short Linear Motifs and protein-protein interfaces. We test the use of ES-scores in genomic studies in pediatric leukemias that easily recapitulates the main mechanisms of resistance to targeted and chemotherapy drugs. To experimentally test the functional role of the predictions, we performed saturated mutagenesis in NT5C2, a protein commonly mutated in relapsed pediatric lymphocytic leukemias. The approach was able to capture both commonly mutated sites and identify previously uncharacterized functionally relevant regions that are not frequently mutated in these cancers. This work shows that the characterization of protein structures provides a link between large genomic studies, with mostly variants of unknown significance, to functional systematic characterization, prioritizing variants of interest in the therapeutic setting and informing on their possible mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with several genetic alterations which play an important role in the disease heterogeneity and clinical outcome including gene fusion between TMPRSS2 and members of the ETS family of transcription factors specially ERG. The expanding wealth of pathology whole slide images (WSIs) and the increasing adoption of deep learning (DL) approaches offer a unique opportunity for pathologists to streamline the detection of ERG:TMPRSS2 fusion status. Here, we used two large cohorts of digitized H&E-stained slides from radical prostatectomy specimens to train and evaluate a DL system capable of detecting the ERG fusion status and also detecting tissue regions of high diagnostic and prognostic relevance. Slides from the PCa TCGA dataset were split into training (n=318), validation (n=59), and testing sets (n=59) with the training and validation sets being used for training the model and optimizing its hyperparameters, respectively while the testing set was used for evaluating the performance. Additionally, we used an internal testing cohort consisting of 314 WSIs for independent assessment of the models performance. The ERG prediction model achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.73 in the TCGA testing set and the internal testing cohort, respectively. In addition to slide-level classification, we also identified highly attended patches for the cases predicted as either ERG-positive or negative which had distinct morphological features associated with ERG status. We subsequently characterized the cellular composition of these patches using HoVer-Net model trained on the PanNuke dataset to segment and classify the nuclei into five main categories. Notably, a high ratio of neoplastic cells in the highly-attended regions was significantly associated with shorter overall and progression-free survival while high ratios of immune, stromal and stromal to neoplastic cells were all associated with longer overall and metastases-free survival. Our work highlights the utility of deploying deep learning systems on digitized histopathology slides to predict key molecular alteration in cancer together with their associated morphological features which would streamline the diagnostic process.",

Based on this finding a correlation between rat and human Kp,uu,brain was expected. However, no correlation between rat and human Kp,uu,brain was found (R^2=0.01; n=13). There was no (as also anticipated) correlation between passive Pe and human Kp,uu,brain (R^2=0.04; n=16) and compounds with measured or predicted efflux did not have lower Kp,uu,brain than compounds without efflux. The compound with highest Kp,uu,brain in man (2.8) is effluxed and predicted to have high passive Pe and has no apparent efflux at the rat BBB. The MDR-1 substrate with highest Kp,uu,brain in rat (2.4) has very low Kp,uu,brain in man (0.15) is predicted to have high passive Pe.\n\nConclusionResults indicate that available human Kp,uu,brain-data are too uncertain to be applicable for validation of predictions and understanding of clinical brain uptake of drugs and drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "Venlafaxine (VFX), a commonly prescribed antidepressant often detected in wastewater effluent, and acute temperature elevations from climate change and increased urbanization, are two environmental stressors currently placing freshwater ecosystems at risk. This study focused on understanding if exposure to VFX impacts the agitation temperature (Tag) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Additionally, we examined the interactive effects of VFX and acute thermal stress on zebrafish heat shock and inflammatory immune responses. A 96 hour 1.0 g/L VFX exposure experiment was conducted, followed by assessment of thermal tolerance via CTmax challenge. Heat shock proteins and pro-inflammatory immune cytokines were quantified through gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR (qPCR) on hsp 70, hsp 90, hsp 47, il-8, tnf, and il-1{beta} within gill and liver tissue. No significant changes in agitation temperature between control and exposed fish were observed, nor were there any differences in CTmax based on treatment. Unsurprisingly, hsp 47, 70, and 90 were all upregulated in groups exposed solely to CTmax, while only hsp 47 within gill tissue showed signs of interactive effects, which was significantly decreased in fish exposed to both VFX and CTmax. No induction of an inflammatory response occurred. This study demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of VFX have no impact on thermal tolerance performance in zebrafish. However, VFX is capable of causing diminished function of protective heat shock mechanisms, which could be detrimental to freshwater fish populations and aquatic ecosystems as temperature spikes become more frequent from climate change and urbanization near watersheds.\n\nSummary StatementThis study predicts the effects that climate change and anthropogenic pollutants may have on fish ability to tolerate elevated temperatures, and examines the physiologic challenges these stressors may introduce.",

    "abstract": "SGLT2 inhibitors are widely prescribed drugs for type 2 diabetes and heart failure. It seems that their beneficial health effects are multifaceted and not only limited to the amelioration of glycemic profile. It is suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors-induced glycosuria causes a metabolic shift that mimics the fasting response. It is also known that calorie restriction leads to enhanced longevity in mice. Thus, we hypothesized that long-term treatment of mice with SGLT2 inhibitors might extend their life span. To this end male C57BL6 mice at the age of 4 months were put on a normal chow diet or on a diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg canagliflozin. The canagliflozin-treated mice showed lower body weight gain over time and increased life span. The median survival of control mice was 107.5 weeks, while that of the canagliflozin-treated group was 112.5 weeks (p=0.011). No difference was seen in the presence or severity of cataracts. This study showed for the first time an enhanced median survival of canagliflozin-treated male mice with a homogeneous genetic background (C57BL6).

Only 10 metabolites were present in both fruits and axenic cultures while 19 were found exclusively on olives and 16 exclusively in axenic cultures. The 45 identified metabolites comprised fatty acid, phenolics, pyrones, sterols, terpenes and miscellaneous compounds. Each Colletotrichum species produced a different spectrum of metabolites depending of the type of matrices. On artificially inoculated olives the severity of symptoms, the amount of fungal secondary metabolites and their number peaked 7 dpi irrespective of the cultivar susceptibility and the virulence of the Colletotrichum species.

    "abstract": "The star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) is well known for its unique star-like rostrum ( star) which is formed by 22 nasal appendages highly specialised for tactile sensation. As a northerly distributed insectivorous mammal occupying both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, this sensory appendage is regularly exposed to cold water and thermally conductive soil, leading us to ask whether the surface temperature, a proxy for blood flow to the star, conforms to the local ambient temperature to conserve body heat. Alternatively, given the high functioning and sensory nature of the star, we posited it was possible that the rays may be kept continually warm when foraging, with augmented peripheral blood flow serving the metabolic needs of this tactile sensory organ. To test these ideas, we remotely monitored the surface temperatures of the star and other uninsulated appendages in response to changes in local water or ground temperature in captive, wild-caught star-nosed moles. While the tail responded to increasing heat load through vasodilation, the surface temperature of the star consistently thermoconformed, varying passively in surface temperature, suggesting little evidence for thermoregulatory vasomotion. This thermoconforming response may have evolved as a compensatory response related to the high costs of heat dissipation to water or soil in this actively foraging insectivore.\n\nSummary Statement (for JEB Submission)The highly mechanosensitive nasal rays of the star-nosed mole conform closely with ambient temperature thereby minimizing heat loss without apparent changes in sensory performance.",

This study investigated the effect of familial AD-linked App mutations on hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity and function. To enable calcium imaging of neuronal activity, AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in (APPki) mice were crossed with Thy1-GCaMP6s+/- (C-TG) mice to generate AppNL-G-F/NL-G-FxThy1-GCaMP6s+/- (A-TG) mice, which were characterized at 12 months of age. A-TG mice exhibited A{beta} pathology in the hippocampus. In several configurations of an air-induced running task, A-TG mice and C-TG mice were equally successful in learning to run or to stay immobile. In the Morris water place test, A-TG mice were impaired, but learned the task. Comparisons of hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity in the air-induced running task showed that A-TG mice displayed neuronal hypoactivity both during movement and immobility. A-TG mice and C-TG CA1 neuronal encoding of distance or time in the air induced running task were not different. These results suggest that knock-in of familial AD-linked mutations in A-TG mice results in A{beta} pathology, neuronal hypoactivity, and cognitive impairment without severely affecting CA1 neuronal encoding. In comparison to APPki mice, A-TG mice had less severe AD-like memory impairments at 12 months of age (Saito et al., 2014; Mehla et al., 2019), suggesting that the disease onset was delayed in A-TG mice. The effect of APP mutations may have been mitigated through genetic mechanisms when APPKi mice were crossed with C-TG mice.",

    "abstract": "Linear parametric state-space models are a ubiquitous tool for analyzing neural time series data, providing a way to characterize the underlying brain dynamics with much greater statistical efficiency than non-parametric data analysis approaches. However, neural time series data are frequently time-varying, exhibiting rapid changes in dynamics, with transient activity that is often the key feature of interest in the data. Stationary methods can be adapted to time-varying scenarios by employing fixed-duration windows under an assumption of quasi-stationarity. But time-varying dynamics can be explicitly modeled by switching state-space models, i.e., by using a pool of state-space models with different dynamics selected by a probabilistic switching process. Unfortunately, exact solutions for state inference and parameter learning with switching state-space models are intractable. Here we revisit a switching state-space model inference approach first proposed by Ghahramani and Hinton. We provide explicit derivations for solving the inference problem iteratively after applying variational approximation on the joint posterior of the hidden states and the switching process. We introduce a novel initialization procedure using an efficient leave-one-out strategy to compare among candidate models, which significantly improves performance compared to the existing method that relies on deterministic annealing. We then utilize this state-inference solution within a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate model parameters of the switching process and the linear state-space models with dynamics potentially shared among candidate models. We perform extensive simulations under different settings to benchmark performance against existing switching inference methods and further validate the robustness of our switching inference solution outside the generative switching model class. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method for sleep spindle detection in real recordings, showing how switching state-space models can be used to detect and extract transient spindles from human sleep electroencephalograms in an unsupervised manner.\n\nAuthor summaryAn inherent aspect of brain activity is that it changes over time, but existing methods for analyzing neuroscience data typically assume that the underlying activity is strictly stationary, i.e., the properties of that activity do not change over time. One way of handling time-varying data is to break the data into smaller segments that one assumes to be quasi-stationary, but this approach only works if signals vary gradually, and tends to perform poorly when changes are rapid or the target activity is transient in nature. A class of models called linear switching state-space models can explicitly represent time-varying activity, but they pose another set of challenges: exact solutions for such models are intractable, and existing approximate solutions can be highly inaccurate. In this work we present a solution for linear switching state-space models that is able to recover the underlying hidden states and model parameters for time-varying dynamics in a way that is robust to model mis-specification and that outperforms previously proposed methods. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying it to the problem of sleep spindle detection and show that switching state-space models can automatically detect transient spindle activity from human sleep electroencephalograms.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which aging of the central auditory pathway impairs auditory perception in the elderly independent of peripheral cochlear decline is debated. To cause auditory deficits in normal hearing elderly, central aging needs to degrade neural sound representations at some point along the auditory pathway. However, inaccessible to psychophysical methods, the level of the auditory pathway at which aging starts to effectively degrade neural sound representations remains poorly differentiated. Here we tested how potential age-related changes in the auditory brainstem affect the stability of spatiotemporal multiunit complex speech-like sound representations in the auditory midbrain of old normal hearing CBA/J mice. Although brainstem conduction speed slowed down in old mice, the change was limited to the sub-millisecond range and only minimally affected temporal processing in the midbrain (i.e. gaps-in-noise sensitivity). Importantly, besides the small delay, multiunit complex temporal sound representations in the auditory midbrain did not differ between young and old mice. This shows that although small age-related neural effects in simple sound parameters in the lower brainstem may be present in aging they do not effectively deteriorate complex neural population representations at the level of the auditory midbrain when peripheral hearing remains normal. This result challenges the widespread belief of  pure central auditory decline as an automatic consequence of aging. However, the stability of midbrain processing in aging emphasizes the role of undetected  hidden peripheral damage and accumulating effects in higher cortical auditory-cognitive processing explaining perception deficits in  normal hearing elderly.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model estimation enables assessment of causal interactions in brain networks. However, accurately estimating MVAR models for high-dimensional electrophysiological recordings is challenging due to the extensive data requirements. Hence, the applicability of MVAR models for study of brain behavior over hundreds of recording sites has been very limited. Prior work has focused on different strategies for selecting a subset of important MVAR coefficients in the model and is motivated by the potential of MVAR models and the data requirements of conventional least-squares estimation algorithms. Here we propose incorporating prior information, such as fMRI, into MVAR model estimation using a weighted group LASSO regularization strategy. The proposed approach is shown to reduce data requirements by a factor of two relative to the recently proposed group LASSO method of Endemann et al. (2022) while resulting in models that are both more parsimonious and have higher fidelity to the ground truth. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using simulation studies of physiologically realistic MVAR models derived from iEEG data. The robustness of the approach to deviations between the conditions under which the prior information and iEEG data is obtained is illustrated using models from data collected in different sleep stages. This approach will allow accurate effective connectivity analyses over short time scales, facilitating investigations of causal interactions in the brain underlying perception and cognition during rapid transitions in behavioral state.",

    "abstract": "The harmful consequences of heat stress (HS) on physiology are well documented, but the molecular aspects of changing thermal conditions are poorly understood. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of this stress on the morphology, phenotype, proliferative capacity, and fate decision of MSCs is required. Our thorough characterization of MSCs transcriptome showed a major effect of HS on the transcriptional landscape. Specifically, examining the effect after three days of moderate HS shows changes in many cell processes, such as immune response, cell cycle, and differentiation. Surprisingly, we detected a long-term effect on cell identity even after short stress, possibly through the activation of bivalent genes related to cell lineage decisions. Finally, comparing the differentially expressed genes following short HS with their transcriptional state after three days of recovery, we find transient upregulation of many members of the MLL family and other histone modifiers; a finding which offers a potential mechanistic account for the stable bivalent genes activation. This could be used to predict and modify the long-term effect of HS on cell identity.\n\nSummary blurbHeat shock alters mesenchymal stem cells transcriptional programs, resulting in stable activation of lineage commitment genes, thus explaining the shift in the identity and fate of the cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=98 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517224v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@91f54dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7fa0e2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b6f54org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a2180_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Shape is a conspicuous and fundamental property of biological systems entailing the function of organs and tissues. While much emphasis has been put on how tissue tension and mechanical properties drive shape changes, whether and how a given tissue geometry influences subsequent morphogenesis remains poorly characterized. Here, we explored how curvature, a key descriptor of tissue geometry, impinges on the dynamics of epithelial tissue invagination. We found that the morphogenesis of the fold separating the adult Drosophila head and thorax segments is driven by the invagination of the Deformed (Dfd) homeotic compartment. Dfd controls invagination by modulating actomyosin organization and in-plane epithelial tension via the Tollo and Dystroglycan receptors. By experimentally introducing curvature heterogeneity within the homeotic compartment, we established that a curved tissue geometry converts the Dfd-dependent in-plane tension into an inward force driving folding. Accordingly, the interplay between in-plane tension and tissue curvature quantitatively explains the spatiotemporal folding dynamics. Collectively, our work highlights how genetic patterning and tissue geometry provide a simple design principle driving folding morphogenesis during development.",

Using a novel hierarchical optimization approach, we identified priority areas for expanding the global protected area system to explicitly account for such risks whilst maximizing protection of all known terrestrial vertebrate species. We illustrate how reducing exposure to these risks requires expanding the area of the global protected area system by 1.6% while still meeting conservation targets. Incorporating risks from weak governance drove the greatest changes in spatial priorities for protection, while incorporating risks from climate change required the largest increase in global protected area. Conserving wide-ranging species required countries with relatively strong governance to protect more land when bordering nations with comparatively weak governance. Our results underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional coordination and demonstrate how risk can be efficiently incorporated into conservation planning.\n\nArticle Impact StatementAccounting for governance, land use and climate risks will result in more resilient and effective conservation effort for biodiversity.",

KDM5 proteins can regulate transcription through their histone demethylase activity in addition to demethylase-independent gene regulatory functions that remain less characterized. To expand our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to KDM5-mediated transcription regulation, we used TurboID proximity labeling to identify KDM5-interacting proteins.\n\nResultsUsing Drosophila melanogaster, we enriched for biotinylated proteins from KDM5-TurboID-expressing adult heads using a newly generated control for DNA-adjacent background in the form of dCas9:TurboID. Mass spectrometry analyses of biotinylated proteins identified both known and novel candidate KDM5 interactors, including members of the SWI/SNF and NURF chromatin remodeling complexes, the NSL complex, Mediator, and several insulator proteins.\n\nConclusionsCombined, our data shed new light on potential demethylase-independent activities of KDM5.

In this study, we developed a simple and cost-effective method - multiple genetic abnormality sequencing (MGA-Seq) - to simultaneously detect SNPs, CNVs, SVs, ecDNA and HSRs in a single tube. This method has been successfully applied in both cancer cell lines and clinical tumour samples and revealed that focal amplification in tumour tissue is substantially heterogeneous. Notably, we delineated the architecture of focal amplification and the ecDNA network by MGA-Seq, which facilitated the exploration of the regulation of gene expression in ecDNA.

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic causes of trait variation is a primary goal of genetic research. One way that individuals can vary genetically is through the existence of variable pangenomic genes - genes that are only present in some individuals in a population. The presence or absence of entire genes could have large effects on trait variation. However, variable pangenomic genes can be missed in standard genotyping workflows, due to reliance on aligning short-read sequencing to reference genomes. A popular method for studying the genetic basis of trait variation is linkage mapping, which identifies quantitative trait loci (QTLs), regions of the genome that harbor causative genetic variants. Large-scale linkage mapping in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has found thousands of QTLs affecting myriad yeast phenotypes. To enable the resolution of QTLs caused by variable pangenomic genes, we used long-read sequencing to generate highly complete de novo assemblies of 16 diverse yeast isolates. With these assemblies we resolved growth QTLs to specific genes that are absent from the reference genome but present in the broader yeast population at appreciable frequency. Copies of genes also recombine onto chromosomes where they are absent in the reference genome, and we found that these copies generate additional QTLs whose resolution requires pangenome characterization. Our findings demonstrate the power of long-read sequencing to identify the genetic basis of trait variation.",

We investigated the inhibitory effects of dihydroartemisinin (DHA), methoxyamino chalcone (C3), and iron chelators including deferiprone (DFP), 1-(N-acety1-6-aminohexyl)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridin-4-one (CM1) and deferiprone-resveratrol hybrid (DFP-RVT) against the growth of wild-type (WT) P. falciparum parasites and those with k13 and fd mutations. C3 showed antimalarial potency similar to the iron chelators. Surprisingly, combined treatments of DHA with the C3 or iron chelators showed moderately antagonistic effects against P. falciparum growth. No differences were observed among the mutant parasites with respect to their sensitivity to C3 and the chelators, or the interactions of these compounds with DHA.

We report a hybrid deep learning-based tool, CircSite, to predict RBP binding sites at single-nucleotide resolution and detect key contributed nucleotides on circRNA transcripts. CircSite takes advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer for learning local and global representations of circRNAs binding to RBPs, respectively.

    "abstract": "Cells mediate interactions with the extracellular environment through a crowded assembly of transmembrane proteins, glycoproteins and glycolipids on their plasma membrane. The extent to which surface crowding modulates the biophysical interactions of ligands, receptors, and other macromolecules is poorly understood due to the lack of methods to quantify surface crowding on native cell membranes. In this work, we demonstrate that physical crowding on reconstituted membranes and live cell surfaces attenuates the effective binding affinity of macromolecules such as IgG antibodies in a surface crowding-dependent manner. We combine experiment and simulation to design a crowding sensor based on this principle that provides a quantitative readout of cell surface crowding. Our measurements reveal that surface crowding decreases IgG antibody binding by 2-20 fold in live cells compared to a bare membrane surface, resulting in a cell surface osmotic pressure opposing binding of 1 - 4 kPa. Our sensors show that sialic acid, a negatively charged monosaccharide, contributes disproportionately to red blood cell surface crowding via electrostatic repulsion, despite occupying only ~1% of the total cell membrane by mass. We also observe significant differences in surface crowding for different cell types and find that expression of single oncogenes can both increase and decrease crowding, suggesting that surface crowding may be an indicator of both cell type and state. Our high-throughput, single-cell measurement of cell surface osmotic pressure may be combined with functional assays to enable further biophysical dissection of the cell surfaceome.\n\nSignificance StatementCells interact with each other and the extracellular environment through a crowded assembly of polymers on their plasma membranes. The high density of these surface polymers can generate physical crowding that impacts cell function. However, tools to quantify the extent and effect of surface crowding on live cell membranes are lacking. In this work, we design macromolecular sensors that act as direct reporters of cell surface crowding. We combine experiments on reconstituted and live cell surfaces with molecular dynamics simulations to provide a mechanistic understanding of how cell surface crowding reduces binding of soluble molecules, and we show that crowding varies significantly with cell type and is affected by oncogene expression.",

As the largest protein, Tic214 traverses the inner membrane, the intermembrane space and the outer membrane, connecting the TOC complex with the TIC proteins. An inositol hexaphosphate (InsP6 or I6P) molecule is located at the Tic214-Toc90 interface and stabilizes their assembly. Moreover, four lipid molecules are located within or above an inner-membrane funnel formed by Tic214, Tic20, Simp1 and Ctap5.

    "abstract": "The protein SAS-6 forms dimers, which then self-assemble into rings that are critical for the nine-fold symmetry of the centriole organelle. It has recently been shown experimentally that the self-assembly of SAS-6 rings is strongly facilitated on a surface, shifting the reaction equilibrium by four orders of magnitude compared to the bulk. Moreover, a fraction of non-canonical symmetries (i.e., different from nine) was observed. In order to understand which aspects of the system are relevant to ensure efficient self-assembly and selection of the nine-fold symmetry, we have performed Brownian dynamics computer simulation with patchy particles and then compared our results with experimental ones. Adsorption onto the surface was simulated by a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo procedure and Random Sequential Adsorption kinetics. Furthermore, self-assembly was described by Langevin equations with hydrodynamic mobility matrices. We find that as long as the interaction energies are weak, the assembly kinetics can be described well by the coagulation-fragmentation equations in the reaction-limited approximation. By contrast, larger interaction energies lead to kinetic trapping and diffusion-limited assembly. We find that selection of nine-fold symmetry requires a small value for the angular interaction range. These predictions are confirmed by the experimentally observed reaction constant and angle fluctuations. Overall, our simulations suggest that the SAS-6 system works at the crossover between a relatively weak binding energy that avoids kinetic trapping and a small angular range that favors the nine-fold symmetry.",

    "abstract": "The biological and clinical impact of neoplastic and immune cell type ratios in the glioblastoma (GBM) tumour microenvironment is being realised. Characterising and quantifying cell types within GBMs at scale will facilitate a better understanding of the association between the cellular landscape and tumour phenotypes or clinical correlates. This study aimed to develop a tool that can deconvolute immune and neoplastic cells within the GBM tumour microenvironment from bulk RNA sequencing data. We developed an IDH wild-type (IDHwt) GBM specific single immune cell reference dataset, from four independent studies, consisting of B cells, T cells, NK cells, microglia, tumour associated macrophages, monocytes, mast and DC cells. We used this alongside an existing neoplastic single cell-type dataset consisting of astrocyte-like, oligodendrocyte- and neuronal-progenitor like and mesenchymal GBM cancer cells to create both marker and gene signature matrix-based deconvolution tools. We then applied single-cell resolution imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to ten IDHwt GBM samples, five paired primary and recurrent tumours, in parallel with these tools to determine which performed best. Marker based gene expression deconvolution using GBM tissue specific markers, which we have packaged as GBMdeconvoluteR, gave the most accurate results. The correlation between immune cell quantification by IMC and by GBMdeconvoluteR for primary IDHwt GBM samples was 0.52 (Pearsons P=7.8x10-3) and between neoplastic cell quantification by IMC and by GBMdeconvoluteR was 0.75 (Pearsons P=1.2x10-3). We applied GBMdeconvoluteR to bulk GBM RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and were able to recapitulate recent findings from multi-omics single cell studies with regards associations between mesenchymal GBM cancer cells and both lymphoid and myeloid cells. Furthermore, we were able to expand upon this to show that these associations are stronger in patients with worse prognosis. GBMdeconvoluteR is accessible online at https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk.\n\nKey pointsGBMdeconvoluteR is a glioblastoma-specific cellular deconvolution tool.

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the diversification of the Neotropical mangrove flora from the Miocene to the present, using a fairly comprehensive database of 110 pollen records distributed across the whole Caribbean region. A Neogene-Quaternary diversification trend (NQDT) has been identified, characterized by an increase of 25 genera (~78%) with respect to the 7 already existing Paleogene representatives. Only two genera appeared during the Miocene and the maximum increases were observed in the Pliocene-Quaternary transition and the modernliving record. Half of the true-mangrove genera (Rhizophora, Pelliciera, Acrostichum) were already present before the Neogene and the others appeared gradually in the Oligo-Miocene (Crenea), the Early-Middle Miocene (Avicennia) and the Mio-Pliocene (Laguncularia). None of the extant associate mangrove genera were present during the Paleogene and all appeared in the Miocene (23 genera) or the Oligo-Miocene transition (3 genera), being the main responsible for the NQDT, in absolute numbers. No regional extinctions were recorded since the Miocene in the Caribbean mangroves, at the generic level. These observations should be complemented with further high-resolution quantitative studies aimed at finding potential causal relationships with climatic, eustatic and paleogeographical shifts.",

    "abstract": "The proper balance and transition between cellular quiescence and proliferation are critical to tissue homeostasis, repair, and regeneration. The likelihood of quiescence-to-proliferation transition is inversely correlated with quiescence depth, and deep quiescent cells are less likely to exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle than shallow quiescent cells. The regulatory mechanisms of quiescence depth are poorly understood but essential for developing strategies against hypo- or hyper-proliferation diseases such as aging and cancer. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that the activation threshold of the bistable Rb-E2F gene network switch (ThE2F) controls quiescence depth. We have also identified coarse- and fine-tuning ThE2F modulators in rat embryonic fibroblasts. To examine whether other quiescent cells (including most adult stem and progenitor cells) under different environmental conditions use the same or different modulators of quiescence depth, here we studied the behaviors of 30,000 theoretical quiescent cell models that each support a functional Rb-E2F bistable switch with a unique parameter set. We found that although the vastly heterogeneous quiescent cell models exhibited no apparent parameter patterns, they converged at two alternative groups of strong quiescence-depth modulators (G1 cyclin/cdk-related and Rb/E2F complex-related). Our further machine learning (decision tree) analysis suggested that the Rb protein level and dephosphorylation rate in quiescent cells determine which modulator group to use to regulate quiescence depth.",

    "abstract": "The multivariate evolution of populations is the result of the interactions between natural selection, drift, and the underlying genetic structure of the traits involved. Covariances among traits bias responses to selection, and the multivariate axis which describes the greatest genetic variation is expected to be aligned with patterns of divergence across populations. An exception to this expectation is when selection acts on trait combinations lacking genetic variance, which limits evolutionary change. Here we used a common garden field experiment of individuals from 57 populations of Ipomoea hederacea to characterize linear and nonlinear selection on five quantitative traits in the field. We then formally compare patterns of selection to previous estimates of within population genetic covariance structure (the G-matrix) and population divergence in these traits. We found that selection is poorly aligned with previous estimates of genetic covariance structure and population divergence. In addition, the trait combinations favoured by selection were generally lacking genetic variation, possessing approximately 15- 30% as much genetic variation as the most variable combination of traits. Our results suggest that patterns of population divergence are likely the result of the interplay between adaptive responses, correlated response, and selection favoring traits lacking genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most widely studied organisms in biology due to its small size, rapid life cycle, and manipulable genetics. Research with C. elegans depends on labor-intensive and time-consuming manual procedures, imposing a major bottleneck for many studies, especially those involving large numbers of animals. Here we describe the first general-purpose tool, WormPicker, a robotic system capable of performing complex genetic manipulations and other tasks by imaging, phenotyping, and transferring C. elegans on standard agar media. Our system uses a motorized stage to move an imaging system and a robotic arm over an array of plates. Machine vision tools identify animals and assay developmental stage, morphology, sex, expression of fluorescent reporters, and other phenotypes. Based on the results of these assays the robotic arm selectively transfers individual animals using an electrically self-sterilized wire loop, with the aid of machine vision and electrical capacitance sensing. Automated C. elegans manipulation shows reliability and throughput comparable to standard manual methods. We developed software to enable the system to autonomously carry out complex protocols. To validate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods we used the system to perform a collection of common C. elegans procedures, including genetic crossing, genetic mapping, and genomic integration of a transgene. Our robotic system will accelerate C. elegans research and opens possibilities for performing genetic and pharmacological screens that would be impractical using manual methods.\n\nSignificance StatementThe nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful genetic model organism in life sciences due to its compact anatomy, short life cycle, and optical transparency.

    "abstract": "The acute traumatic or surgical loss of skeletal muscle, known as volumetric muscle loss (VML), is a devastating type of injury that results in exacerbated and persistent inflammation followed by fibrosis. The mechanisms that mediate the magnitude and duration of the inflammatory response and ensuing fibrosis after VML remain understudied and as such, the development of regenerative therapies has been limited. To address this need, we profiled how lipid mediators, which are potent regulators of the immune response after injury, varied with VML injuries that heal or result in fibrosis. We observed that non-healing VML injuries displayed increased pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and a lack of pro-resolving lipid mediators. Treatment of VML with a pro-resolving lipid mediator synthesized from docosahexaenoic acid, called Maresin 1, ameliorated fibrosis through reduction of neutrophils and macrophages and improved myogenesis, leading to enhanced recovery of muscle strength. These results expand our knowledge of the dysregulated immune response that develops after VML and identify a novel immuno-regenerative therapeutic modality in Maresin 1.",

Here, we used hydrodynamic modelling to identify ecologically connected networks of marine reserves (MRs) and evaluated these networks with socio-economic indicators. Most of the networks are homogenous with similar levels of development, shared languages, and other cultural values. However, we found that 17% (11/66) of the largest networks (>20 MRs) span multiple countries. These heterogenous networks are composed of countries with different economic, political, and cultural views. Countries that control more, larger marine reserves also have a more even ratio of source reserves to sinks. We discuss that, while such economic and cultural homogeneity might lead to more efficient ecological management in the short term, heterogeneous networks may prove to be more resilient in the longer term, when climate change will modify marine connectivity.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput immunoglobulin sequencing (IgSeq) has been developed and applied to study the adaptive immune response extensively for more than a decade. However, generating large-scale, high-fidelity sequencing data is still challenging, and furthermore, not much has been done to characterize adjuvants effects at the repertoire level. Thus, we developed an improved library prep protocol and standardized the data analysis pipeline for accurate repertoire profiling. In addition, two metrics were implemented to assess repertoire clone properties. We then studied systemically the effects of two adjuvants, CpG and Alum, on the Ig heavy chain repertoire using the ovalbumin (OVA) challenged mouse model. Ig repertoires of different tissues (spleen and bone marrow) and isotypes (IgG and IgM) were examined and compared in terms of sequence mutation frequency, IGHV gene usage, CDR3 length, rescaled Hill numbers for clonal diversity, and clone selection strength. As a result, Ig repertoires of different tissues or isotypes exhibited distinguishable profiles at the non-immunized steady state. Adjuvanted immunizations further resulted in statistically significant alterations in Ig repertoire compared with PBS or OVA alone immunized groups. Lastly, we applied unsupervised machine learning techniques - multiple factor analysis and clustering - to identify Ig repertoire signatures in different compartments and under varying immunizations. We found that the IGH repertoires of distinct tissue-isotype compartments or under varying immunizations differed in unique sets of properties. Notably, Alum and CpG effects on the Ig repertoire exhibited different tissue and isotype preferences. The former led to increased diversity of abundant clones of both isotypes in BM only, and the latter promoted the selection of IgG clones only but in both tissues. The patterns of Ig repertoire changes likely reflected possible action mechanisms of these two adjuvants.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of cell signaling in chondrocytes and in bone cells, such as osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and an elevated burden of senescent cells in cartilage and bone, are implicated in osteoarthritis (OA). Mass spectrometric analyses provides a crucial molecular tool-kit to understand complex signaling relationships in age-related diseases, such as OA. Here we introduce a novel mass spectrometric workflow to promote proteomic studies of bone and cartilage. This workflow uses highly specialized steps, including extensive overnight demineralization, pulverization, and incubation for 72 h in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and EDTA, followed by proteolytic digestion. Analysis on a high-resolution Orbitrap Eclipse and Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer using Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) provides deep coverage of the bone proteome, and preserves post-translational modifications, such as hydroxyproline. A spectral library-free quantification strategy, directDIA, identified and quantified over 2,000 protein groups (with [&ge;] 2 unique peptides) from calcium-rich bone matrices. Key components identified were proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM), bone-specific proteins (e.g., secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich, SPARC, and bone sialoprotein 2, IBSP), and signaling proteins (e.g., transforming growth factor beta-2, TGFB2), and lysyl oxidase homolog 2 (LOXL2), an important protein in collagen crosslinking. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) were identified without the need for specific enrichment. This includes collagen hydroxyproline modifications, chemical modifications for collagen self-assembly and network formation. Multiple senescence factors were identified, such as complement component 3 (C3) protein of the complement system and many matrix metalloproteinases, that might be monitored during age-related bone disease progression. Our innovative workflow yields in-depth protein coverage and quantification strategies to discover underlying biological mechanisms of bone aging and to provide tools to monitor therapeutic interventions. These novel tools to monitor the bone proteome open novel horizons to investigate bone-specific diseases, many of which are age-related.",

For example, parabiosis and partial reprogramming through overexpressing four stem cell transcription factors (Yamanaka factors) both rejuvenate organisms and cells1-5. We hypothesize there are many other genetic solutions to human cell rejuvenation, and some solutions may be safer and more potent than current gene targets. We set out to develop a systematic approach to identify novel genes that, when overexpressed or repressed, reprogram the global gene expression of a cell back to a younger state. Using the Hayflick model of human cell replicative aging, we performed a Perturb-seq screen of 200 transcription factors (TFs) selected through a combination of bioinformatic analysis and literature search. We identified dozens of potentially rejuvenating TFs--those that when overexpressed or repressed in late passage cells reprogrammed global gene expression patterns back to an earlier passage state. We further validated four top TF perturbations through molecular phenotyping of various aging hallmarks. Late passage cells either overexpressing EZH2 or E2F3 or repressing STAT3 or ZFX had more cell division, less senescence, improved proteostasis, and enhanced mitochondrial function. These TF perturbations led to similar downstream gene expression programs. In addition, the rejuvenating effects of these TFs were independent of telomeres. We believe our general approach for identifying rejuvenating factors can be applied to other model systems, and some of the top TF perturbations we discovered will lead to future research in novel, safer rejuvenation therapies.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of super-resolution imaging techniques is benefited from the ongoing competition for optimal rhodamine fluorophores. Yet, it seems blinded to select the best one among different rhodamine derivatives for specific labeling and imaging, without the knowledge on imaging impact of even the minimum structural transform. Herein, we have designed a pair of self-blinking sulforhodamines (STMR, SRhB) with the bare distinction of methyl or ethyl substituents, and engineered them with Halo protein ligands. Although the two present similar spectral properties ({lambda}ab, {lambda}fl, {square}, etc.), they demonstrated unique single-molecule characteristics preferring to individual imaging applications. Experimentally, STMR with high emissive rates was qualified for imaging structures with rapid dynamics (endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria), and SRhB with prolonged on-times and photostability was suited for relatively \"static\" nuclei and microtubules. Utilized this new knowledge, the mitochondrial morphology during apoptosis and ferroptosis was first super-resolved by STMR. Our study highlights the significance of even the smallest structural modification to the modulation of super-resolution imaging performance, and would provide insight for future fluorophore design.",

    "abstract": "Here we demonstrate a method to estimate the errors of free energy differences calculated by molecular simulations. The widths of the confidence intervals can be calculated solely from temperature and the number of transitions between states. Accuracy better than {+/-} 4.184 kJ/mol (1 kcal/mol) can be achieved by a simulation at 300 K with four forward and four reverse transitions. Markovianity of the process is a pre-requisite. For a two-state Markovian system, the confidence interval suggested below is exact (not only asymptotic or approximative), regardless the number of transitions.\n\nTOC Graphic O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Defective endometrial stromal cell decidualization is a major cause of recurrent implantation failure (RIF), a condition with a prevalence of [~]15%. To treat RIF, a stronger understanding of the endometrial factors that regulate decidualization is required. Here we studied the role of the kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) in regulating human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. Our data revealed KISS1R inhibits HESC decidualization in vitro in a manner associated with a striking reduction in ESR1 protein levels. To determine whether KISSR inhibition of decidualization results from reduced ESR1 levels we expressed the dominant negative ESR1-46 isoform in decidualizing HESCs. We found that expression of ESR1-46 in decidualizing HESCs ablated the expression of ESR1-66 and ESR1-54 isomers, and blocked decidualization. Interestingly, when ESR1-64 was co-expressed with ESR1-46, ESR1-66 and ESR1-54 expression was restored and decidualization was rescued. Taken together, these results suggest that KISS1R inhibits HESC decidualization by downregulating ESR1 levels. Based on our findings, we suggest that by inhibiting HESC decidualization, KISS1R regulates the depth of embryo invasion of the stroma, a requirement for a successful pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Humans co-existed and interbred with other hominins which later became extinct. These archaic hominins are known to us only through fossil records and for two cases, genome sequences. Here we engineer Neanderthal and Denisovan sequences into thousands of artificial genes to reconstruct the pre-mRNA processing patterns of these extinct populations. Of the 5,224 alleles tested in this massively parallel splicing reporter assay (MaPSy), we report 969 exonic splicing mutations (ESMs) that correspond to differences in exon recognition between extant and extinct hominins. Using MaPSy splicing variants, predicted splicing variants, and splicing quantitative trait loci, we show that splice-disrupting variants experienced greater purifying selection in anatomically modern humans than in Neanderthals. Adaptively introgressed variants were enriched for moderate effect splicing variants, consistent with positive selection for alternative spliced alleles following introgression. As particularly compelling examples, we characterized a novel tissue-specific alternative splicing variant at the adaptively introgressed innate immunity gene TLR1, as well as a novel Neanderthal introgressed alternative splicing variant in the gene HSPG2 that encodes perlecan. We further identified potentially pathogenic splicing variants found only in Neanderthals and Denisovans in genes related to sperm maturation and immunity. Finally, we found splicing variants that may contribute to variation among modern humans in total bilirubin, balding, hemoglobin levels, and lung capacity. Our findings provide novel insights into natural selection acting on splicing in human evolution and demonstrate how functional assays can be used to identify candidate causal variants underlying differences in gene regulation and phenotype.",
