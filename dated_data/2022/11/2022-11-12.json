    "abstract": "Organoids development relies on the self-organizing properties of adult stem cells to create structures which recapitulate the architecture, functionality, and genetic signature observed in original tissues. Little is known about of the exact nature of the intrinsic cell properties at the origin of organoid generation, and of the signaling pathways governing their plasticity and differentiation. Herein, we carried out a microRNA screen to functionally track adult stem cell from human mammary organoids epithelial cell culture. We uncover miR-106a-3p that enrich adult stem cell-like lineage, defined by CD44 and CD24 expression, and promotes organoids expansion. Transcriptomic analysis reveal that this miRNA acts through the regulation of a set of regulators of transcription REST, CBFB and NF-YA, and thus strengthening the adult stem cell maintenance of human epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that organoids can be directly generated from human epithelial cells by only one miRNA: miR-106a-3p. Hence, we reveal that a transcriptional program is clearly in place to elicit adult stem cells maintenance during organoids development.",

    "abstract": "The brain should be best able to associate distinct behavioral responses to sensory stimuli if these stimuli evoke population firing patterns that are close to orthogonal. To investigate whether task training orthogonalizes population codes in primary visual cortex (V1), we measured the orientation tuning of 4,000-neuron populations in mouse V1 before and after training on a visuomotor task. The effect of task training on population codes could be captured by a simple mathematical transformation of firing rates, which suppressed responses to motor-associated stimuli, but only in cells responding to them at intermediate levels. This transformation orthogonalized the representations of the task orientations by sparsening the population responses to these stimuli. The strength of response transformation varied from trial to trial, suggesting a dynamic circuit mechanism rather than static synaptic plasticity. These results indicate a simple process by which visuomotor associations orthogonalize population codes as early as in primary visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "The count table, a numeric matrix of genes x cells, is the basic input data structure in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state, and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties. However, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives.\n\nSoftwareThe R package transformGamPoi implementing the delta method- and residuals-based variance-stabilizing transformations is available via Bioconductor.

    "abstract": "As the neuroimaging field moves towards detecting smaller effects at higher spatial resolutions, and faster sampling rates, there is increased attention given to the deleterious contribution of unstructured, thermal noise. Here, we critically evaluate the performance of a recently developed reconstruction method, termed NORDIC, for suppressing thermal noise using datasets acquired with various field strengths, voxel sizes, sampling rates, and task designs.\n\nFollowing minimal preprocessing, statistical activation (t-values) of NORDIC processed data was compared to the results obtained with alternative denoising methods. Additionally, we examined the consistency of the estimates of task responses at the single-voxel, single run level, using a finite impulse response (FIR) model. To examine the potential impact on effective image resolution, the overall smoothness of the data processed with different methods was estimated. Finally, to determine if NORDIC alters or removes important temporal information, we employed an exhaustive leave-p-out cross validation approach, using FIR task responses to predict held out timeseries, quantified using R2.\n\nAfter NORDIC, the t-values are increased, an improvement comparable to what could be achieved by 1.5 voxels smoothing, and task events are clearly visible and have less cross-run error. These advantages are achieved in the absence of large changes in estimates of spatial smoothness. Cross-validated R2s based on the FIR models show that NORDIC is not measurably distorting the temporal structure of the data and is the best predictor of non-denoised time courses. The results demonstrate that analyzing 1 run of data after NORDIC produces results equivalent to using 2 to 3 original runs and that NORDIC performs equally well across a diverse array of functional imaging protocols.\n\nSignificance StatementFor functional neuroimaging, the increasing availability of higher field strengths and ever higher spatiotemporal resolutions has led to concomitant increase in concerns about the deleterious effects of thermal noise. Historically this noise source was suppressed using methods that reduce spatial precision such as image blurring or averaging over a large number of trials or sessions, which necessitates large data collection efforts. Here, we critically evaluate the performance of a recently developed reconstruction method, termed NORDIC. Across datasets varying in field strength, voxel sizes, sampling rates, and task designs, NORDIC produces substantial gains in data quality. Both conventional t-statistics derived from general linear models and coefficients of determination for predicting unseen data are improved, while avoiding meaningful increases in typical estimates of image smoothness or substantial losses of temporal information.",

    "abstract": "Central to T cell biology, the T cell receptor (TCR) integrates forces in its triggering process upon interaction with peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)1-3. Phenotypically, forces elicit TCR catch-slip bonds with strong pMHCs but slip-only bonds with weak pMHCs4-10. While such correlation is commonly observed, the quantitative bond pattern and degree of \"catchiness\" vary. We developed two models based on the structure, elastic properties, and force-induced conformational changes of the TCR-pMHC-I/II complexes to derive from their bond characteristics more intrinsic parameters that underlie structural mechanisms, predict T cell signaling, and discriminate antigens. Applying the models to 55 datasets of 12 {beta}TCRs and their mutants interacting with corresponding pMHCs without coreceptor engagement demonstrated the ability for structural and physical parameters to quantitatively integrate and classify a broad range of bond behaviors and biological activities. Comparing to the generic two-state model for catch-slip bond that also fits the data, our models can distinguish class I from class II MHC systems and their best-fit parameters correlate with the TCR/pMHC potency to trigger T cell activation, which the generic model cannot. The models were tested by mutagenesis using structural analysis, bond profile measurement, and functional assay of a MHC and a TCR mutated to alter conformation changes. The extensive comparisons between theory and experiment provided strong validation of the models and testable hypothesis regarding specific conformational changes that control bond profiles, thereby suggesting structural mechanisms for the inner workings of the TCR mechanosensing machinery and plausible explanation of why and how force may amplify TCR signaling and antigen discrimination.",

Under equilibrium conditions, coevolution of this patch selection can result in ideal-free distributions where per-capita growth rates are zero in occupied patches and negative in unoccupied patches. These ideal-free distributions, however, dont explain why species occupy sink patches, competitors have overlapping spatial ranges, or why predators avoid highly productive patches. To understand these patterns, we analyze multi-species Lotka-Volterra models accounting for spatial heterogeneity and environmental stochasticity. In occupied patches at the coESS, we show that the differences between the local contributions to the mean and the variance of the long-term population growth rate are equalized. Applying this characterization to models of antagonistic interactions reveals that environmental stochasticity can partially exorcize the ghost of competition past, select for new forms of enemy-free and victimless space, and generate Hydra effects over evolutionary time scales. Viewing our results through the economic lens of Modern Portfolio Theory highlights why the coESS for patch selection is often a bet-hedging strategy coupling stochastic sink populations. Our results highlight how environmental stochasticity can reverse or amplify evolutionary outcomes due to species interactions or spatial heterogeneity.",

By studying Notch signaling in CBF:H2B-Venus Notch-reporter mice, we show that most B cells receive a Notch signal, which is highest in MZB cells. However, surprisingly, around one-third of MZB cells seem to lose their Notch signal with time. Conditional deletion or constitutive activation of Notch2 in mice upon T-cell-dependent (TD) immunization unraveled an interplay between antigen-induced activation and Notch2 signaling, in which FoB cells that turn off the Notch pathway enter germinal centers, whereas FoB cells with high Notch signals undergo MZB cell or plasmablast differentiation. Input of experimental data into a mathematical modeling framework reveals that MZB cells regularly emerge from antigen-activated FoB cells in a Notch2-dependent manner upon TD immunization.",

    "abstract": "We present a hierarchical and empirical Bayesian framework for testing hypotheses about synaptic neurotransmission, based on the integration of ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (7T-MRS) and magnetoencephalography data (MEG). A first level dynamic causal modelling of cortical microcircuits is used to infer the connectivity parameters of a generative model of individuals neurophysiological observations. At the second level, individuals 7T-MRS estimates of regional neurotransmitter concentration supply empirical priors on synaptic connectivity. We compare the group-wise evidence for alternative empirical priors, defined by monotonic functions of spectroscopic estimates, on subsets of synaptic connections. For efficiency and reproducibility, we used Bayesian model reduction (BMR), parametric empirical Bayes and variational Bayesian inversion. In particular, we used Bayesian model reduction to compare models of how spectroscopic neurotransmitter measures inform estimates of synaptic connectivity. This identifies the subset of synaptic connections that are influenced by neurotransmitter levels, as measured by 7T-MRS. We demonstrate the method using resting-state MEG (i.e., task-free recording) and 7T-MRS data from healthy adults. We perform cross-validation using split-sampling of the MEG dataset. Our results confirm the hypotheses that GABA concentration influences local recurrent inhibitory intrinsic connectivity in deep and superficial cortical layers, while glutamate influences the excitatory connections between superficial and deep layers and connections from superficial to inhibitory interneurons. The method is suitable for applications with magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography, and is well-suited to reveal the mechanisms of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including responses to psychopharmacological interventions.",

Predicting future risks requires monitoring tools to identify changes in the genetic composition of pathogen populations. Here we report the design of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to multiplex 798 loci targeting virulence and fungicide resistance genes, and randomly selected genome-wide markers for the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. The fungus causes one of the most devastating diseases on wheat showing rapid adaptation to fungicides and host resistance. We optimized the primer design by integrating polymorphism data from 632 genomes of the same species. To test the performance of the assay, we genotyped 192 samples in two replicates. Analysis of the short-read sequence data generated by the assay showed a fairly stable success rate across samples to amplify a large number of loci. The performance was consistent between samples originating from pure genomic DNA as well as material extracted directly from infected wheat leaves. In samples with mixed genotypes, we found that the assay recovers variations in allele frequencies. We also explored the potential of the amplicon assay to recover transposable element insertion polymorphism relevant for fungicide resistance. As a proof-of-concept, we show that the assay recovers the pathogen population structure across French wheat fields.

    "abstract": "The multiple-demand (MD) network is sensitive to many aspects of cognitive demand, showing increased activation with more difficult tasks. However, it is currently unknown whether the MD network is modulated by the context in which task difficulty is experienced. Using fMRI, we examined MD network responses to low, medium, and high difficulty arithmetic problems within two cued contexts, an easy versus a hard set. The results showed that MD activity varied reliably with the absolute difficulty of a problem, independent of the context in which the problem was presented. Similarly, MD activity during task execution was independent of the difficulty of the previous trial. Representational similarity analysis further supported that representational distances in the MD network were consistent with a context-independent code. Finally, we identified several regions outside the MD network that showed context-dependent coding, including the inferior parietal lobule, paracentral lobule, posterior insula, and large areas of the visual cortex. In sum, cognitive effort is processed by the MD network in a context-independent manner. We suggest that this absolute coding of cognitive demand in the MD network reflects the limited range of task difficulty that can be supported by the cognitive apparatus.",

Previous research found both that mucilage volume - and the correlated attachment strength - are higher in species from hot, dry, areas suggesting an environmental component of this traits function.\nC_LIO_LIHere we (1) quantified the effect of temperature on attachment across many species in a lab setting, (2) tested the potential mechanism behind this correlation by accelerating desiccation speed without changing temperature, and (3) tested whether these relationships introduce context dependency of the defensive function of mucilage in the field, using field trials with harvester ants.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that (1) increasing temperature during mucilage drying strongly reduced the force needed to dislodge seeds for most species, (2) drying time was likely the driving mechanism behind the loss of attachment strength at higher temperatures, not temperature per se, (3) seeds attached to substrate during higher temperatures or under accelerated drying conditions were far more susceptible to granivory.\nC_LIO_LI Synthesis These results show not only the mechanism behind an abiotic modification of a functional trait of seeds, but that this change majorly alters a key interaction contributing to seed survival.

    "abstract": "KIF1A is an essential neuronal transport motor protein in the kinesin-3 family, known for its superprocessive motility. We determined that superprocessivity of KIF1A dimers originates from a unique structural domain, the lysine rich insertion in loop-12 termed the  K-Loop, which enhances electrostatic interactions between the motor and the microtubule. In 80 mM PIPES buffer, replacing the native loop-12 of KIF1A with that of kinesin-1, resulted in a 6-fold decrease in run length, and adding additional positive charge to loop-12 enhanced the run length. Interestingly, swapping the KIF1A loop-12 into kinesin-1 did not enhance its run length, consistent with the two motor families using different mechanochemical tuning to achieve persistent transport. To investigate the mechanism by which the KIF1A K-loop enhances processivity, we used microtubule pelleting and single-molecule dwell times assays in ATP and ADP. First, the microtubule affinity was similar in ATP and in ADP, consistent with the motor spending the majority of its cycle in a weakly-bound state. Second, the microtubule affinity and single-molecule dwell time in ADP were 6-fold lower in the loop-swap mutant compared to wild type. Thus, the positive charge in loop-12 of KIF1A enhances the run length by stabilizing the motor binding in its vulnerable one-head-bound state. Finally, through a series of mutants with varying positive charge in the K-loop, we found that the KIF1A processivity is linearly dependent on the charge of loop-12.",

    "abstract": "Acute activation of innate immune response in the brain, or neuroinflammation, protects this vital organ from a range of external pathogens and promotes healing after traumatic brain injury. However, chronic neuroinflammation leads to the activation of immune cells like microglia and astrocytes causes damage to the nervous tissue, and is causally linked to a range of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers diseases (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinsons diseases (PD), and many others. While neuroinflammation is a key target for a range of neuropathological diseases, there is a lack of effective countermeasures to tackle it, and existing experimental therapies require fairly invasive intracerebral and intrathecal delivery due to difficulty associated with the therapeutic crossover between the blood-brain barrier (BBB), making such treatments impractical to treat neuroinflammation long-term. Here, we present the development of an optimal neurotherapeutic using our Nanoligomer discovery engine, by screening downregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., Interleukin-1{beta} or IL-1{beta}, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNF-, TNF receptor 1 or TNFR1, Interleukin 6 or IL-6), inflammasomes (e.g., NLRP1), key transcription factors (e.g., nuclear factor kappa-B or NF-{kappa}{beta}) and their combinations, as upstream regulators and canonical pathway targets, to identify and validate the best-in-class treatment. Using our high-throughput drug discovery, target validation, and lead molecule identification via a bioinformatics and AI-based ranking method to design sequence-specific peptide molecules to up-or down-regulate gene expression of the targeted gene at will, we used our discovery engine to perturb and identify most effective upstream regulators and canonical pathways for therapeutic intervention to reverse neuroinflammation. The lead neurotherapeutic was a combination of Nanoligomers targeted to NF-{kappa}{beta} (SB.201.17D.8_ NF-{kappa}{beta}1) and TNFR1 (SB.201.18D.6_TNFR1), which were identified using in vitro cell-based screening in donor-derived human astrocytes, and further validated in vivo using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. The combination treatment SB_NI_111 was delivered without any special formulation using a simple intraperitoneal injection of low-dose (5mg/kg) and was found to significantly suppress the expression of LPS-induced neuroinflammation in mouse hippocampus. These results point to the broader applicability of this approach towards the development of therapies for chronic neuroinflammation-linked neurodegenerative diseases, sleep countermeasures, and others, and the potential for further investigation of the lead neurotherapeutic molecule as reversible gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Co2+ induces the increase of the labile-Fe pool (LIP) by Fe-S cluster damage, heme synthesis inhibition and \"free\" iron import, which affects cell viability. The N2-fixing bacteria, Sinorhizobium meliloti, is a suitable model to determine the roles of Co2+-transporting Cation diffusion facilitator exporters (Co-eCDF) in Fe2+ homeostasis because it has a putative member of this sub-family, AitP, and two specific Fe2+-export systems. An insertional mutant of AitP showed Co2+ sensitivity and accumulation, Fe accumulation and hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, but not Fe2+ sensitivity, despite AitP being a bona fide low affinity Fe2+ exporter as demonstrated by the kinetic analyses of Fe2+ uptake into everted membrane vesicles. Suggesting concomitant Fe2+-dependent induced stress, Co2+ sensitivity was increased in strains carrying mutations in AitP and Fe2+ exporters which did not correlate with the Co2+ accumulation. Growth in the presence of sub-lethal Fe2+ and Co2+ concentrations suggested that free Fe-import might contribute to Co2+ toxicity. Supporting this, Co2+ induced transcription of Fe-import system and genes associated with Fe homeostasis. Analyses of total protoporphyrin content indicates Fe-S cluster attack as the major source for LIP. AitP-mediated Fe2+-export is likely counterbalanced via a non-futile Fe2+-import pathway. Two lines of evidence support this: i) an increased hemin uptake in presence of Co2+ was observed in WT vs. AitP mutant, and ii) hemin reversed the Co2+ sensitivity in the AitP mutant. Thus, the simultaneous detoxification mediated by AitP aids cells to orchestrate an Fe-S cluster salvage response, avoiding the increase in the LIP caused by the disassembly of Fe-S clusters or free iron uptake.\n\nImportanceCross-talk between iron and cobalt has been long recognized in biological systems. This is due to the capacity of cobalt to interfere with proper iron utilization. Cells can detoxify cobalt by exporting mechanisms involving membrane proteins known as exporters. Highlighting the cross-talk, the capacity of several cobalt exporters to also export iron is emerging. Although biologically less important than Fe2+, Co2+ induces toxicity by promoting intracellular Fe release, which ultimately causes additional toxic effects. In this work, we describe how the N2-fixating rhizobial cells solve this perturbation by clearing Fe through a Co2+-exporter, in order to reestablish intracellular Fe-levels by importing non-free Fe, heme. This piggyback-ride type of transport may aid bacterial cells to survive in free-living conditions where high anthropogenic Co2+ content may be encountered.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic data measured across distinct samples has led to a surge in computational methods for data integration. Few studies have explicitly examined the common case of cell-type imbalance between datasets to be integrated, and none have characterized its impact on downstream analyses. To address this gap, we developed the Iniquitate pipeline for assessing the stability of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) integration results after perturbing the degree of imbalance between datasets. Through benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art scRNA-seq integration techniques in 1600 perturbed integration scenarios for a multi-sample peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) dataset, our results indicate that sample imbalance has significant impacts on downstream analyses and the biological interpretation of integration results. We observed significant variation in clustering, cell-type classification, marker gene-based annotation, and query-to-reference mapping in imbalanced settings. Two key factors were found to lead to quantitation differences after scRNA-seq integration - the cell-type imbalance within and between samples (relative cell-type support) and the relatedness of cell-types across samples (minimum cell-type center distance). To account for evaluation gaps in imbalanced contexts, we developed novel clustering metrics robust to sample imbalance, including the balanced Adjusted Rand Index (bARI) and balanced Adjusted Mutual Information (bAMI). Our analysis quantifies biologically-relevant effects of dataset imbalance in integration scenarios and introduces guidelines and novel metrics for integration of disparate datasets. The Iniquitate pipeline and balanced clustering metrics are available at https://github.com/hsmaan/Iniquitate and https://github.com/hsmaan/balanced-clustering, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly prevalent in the aging population, yet currently no disease-modifying treatments are available. Increasing the expression of the cold-shock protein, RBM3, through therapeutic hypothermia is remarkably neuroprotective, but cooling poses a health risk itself, strongly limiting its clinical application. Selective upregulation of RBM3 at normothermia thus holds immense therapeutic potential. Here we identify a poison exon within the RBM3 gene that is solely responsible for cold-induced RBM3 expression. Genetic removal or ASO-mediated manipulation of this exon yields high RBM3 levels independent of cooling. Notably, a single administration of ASO to exclude the poison exon, using FDA-approved chemistry, results in long-lasting increase of RBM3 expression in mouse brains. In prion-diseased mice, this treatment leads to remarkable neuroprotection, with prevention of neuronal loss and spongiosis despite high levels of prion protein. RBM3-inducing ASOs could thus broadly deliver protection in humans in conditions ranging from acute brain injury to Alzheimers disease.\n\nOne sentence summaryInducing cold shock protein RBM3 by modulating its alternative splicing at normothermia is neuroprotective in vivo",

We still do not have clear evidence for the presence of triacylglycerol. If present, the maximum triacylglycerol level, must be at most 10% of acyl plastoquinol or less. The Synechocystis Slr2103 protein was suggested to synthesize triacylglycerol, but the product could be acyl plastoquinol.

    "abstract": "Social behavioral changes are a hallmark of several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, nevertheless the underlying neural substrates of such dysfunction remain poorly understood. Building evidence points to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as one of the key brain regions that orchestrates social behavior. We used this concept with the aim to develop a translational rat model of social-circuit dysfunction, the chronic PFC activation model (CPA). Chemogenetic designer receptor hM3Dq was used to induce chronic activation of the PFC over 10 days, and the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of prolonged PFC hyperactivity were evaluated. To test the sensitivity of this model to pharmacological interventions on longer timescales, and validate its translational potential, the rats were treated with our novel highly selective oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist RO6958375, which has a significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile over oxytocin. CPA rats showed reduced sociability in the three-chamber sociability test, and a concomitant decrease in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission within the PFC as measured by electrophysiological recordings in acute slice preparation. Sub-chronic treatment with a low dose of the novel OXTR agonist following CPA interferes with the emergence of PFC circuit dysfunction, abnormal social behavior and specific transcriptomic changes. These results demonstrate that sustained PFC hyperactivity modifies circuit characteristics and social behaviors in ways that can be modulated by selective OXTR activation and that this model may be used to understand the circuit recruitment of prosocial therapies in drug discovery.",

They play a central role in generating an effective immune response against infectious pathogens, and failures in their regulating mechanisms can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer. While previous works study experimental systems of the immune response with mouse models that are immunized with specific antigens, our study focuses on a real life situation, with an ongoing GC response in a human lymph node (LN) involving multiple asynchronized GCs reacting simultaneously to unknown antigens. We combined laser capture microdissection (LCM) of individual GCs from human LN with next-generation repertoire sequencing (Rep-seq) to characterize individual GCs as distinct evolutionary spaces. In line with well-characterized GC responses in mice, elicited by immunization with model antigens such as NP-CGG, we observe a relatively low sequence similarity, as well as heterogeneous clonal diversity across individual GCs from the same human LN. Still, we identify shared clones in several individual GCs, and phylogenetic tree analysis combined with paratope modeling suggest the re-engagement and rediversification of B-cell clones across GCs as well as expanded clones exhibiting shared antigen responses across distinct GCs, indicating convergent evolution of the GCs. Finally, our study allows for the characterization of non-functional clones, where frequencies of V(D)J or SHM induced stop codons are quantified.",

    "abstract": "14-3-3 proteins are central hub regulators of hundreds of phosphorylated \"client\" proteins. They are subject to over 60 post-translational modifications (PTMs), yet little is known how these PTMs alter 14-3-3 function and its ability to regulate downstream signaling pathways. An often neglected, but well documented 14-3-3 PTM found under physiological and immune-stimulatory conditions is the conversion of tyrosine to 3-nitro-tyrosine at several Tyr sites, two of which are located at sites considered important for 14-3-3 function: Y130 ({beta}-isoform numbering) is located in the primary phospho-client peptide binding groove, while Y213 is found on a secondary binding site that engages with clients for full 14-3-3/client complex formation and client regulation. By genetically encoding 3-nitro-tyrosine, we sought to understand if nitration at Y130 and Y213 effectively modulated 14-3-3 structure, function, and client complexation. The 1.5 [A] resolution crystal structure of 14-3-3 nitrated at Y130 showed the nitro group altered the conformation of key residues in the primary binding site, while functional studies confirmed client proteins failed to bind this variant of 14-3-3. But, in contrast to other client-binding deficient variants, it did not localize to the nucleus. The 1.9 [A] resolution structure of 14-3-3 nitrated at Y213 revealed unusual flexibility of its C-terminal -helix resulting in domain swapping, suggesting additional structural plasticity though its relevance is not clear as this nitrated form retained its ability to bind clients. Collectively, our data suggest nitration of 14-3-3 will alter downstream signaling systems, and if uncontrolled could result in global dysregulation of the 14-3-3 interactome.",

Compared to the FDA-approved PARP (olaparib) and HDAC (vorinostat) inhibitors, kt-3283 displayed enhanced cytotoxicity in Ewing sarcoma models. The kt-3283-induced cytotoxicity was associated with a strong S and G2/M cell cycle arrest in the nanomolar concentration range and elevated DNA damage as assessed by {gamma}H2AX tracking and comet assays. In three-dimensional spheroid models of Ewing sarcoma, kt-3283 showed efficacy in lower concentrations than olaparib and vorinostat and kt-3283 inhibited colonization of Ewing sarcoma cells in an ex vivo lung metastasis model.

The alveolar architecture is disrupted in IPF, yet the effect of IL-11 on dysregulated alveolar repair associated with IPF remains to be elucidated.\n\nWe hypothesized that epithelial-fibroblast communication associated with lung repair is disrupted by IL-11. Thus, we studied whether IL-11 affects the repair responses of alveolar lung epithelium using mouse lung organoids and precision cut lung slices (PCLS). Additionally, we assessed the anatomical distribution of IL-11 and IL-11 receptor in human control and IPF lungs using immunohistochemistry.\n\nIL-11 protein was observed in human control lungs in airway epithelium, macrophages and in IPF lungs, in areas of AT2 cell hyperplasia. IL-11R staining was predominantly present in smooth muscle and macrophages. In mouse organoid co-cultures of epithelial cells with lung fibroblasts, IL-11 decreased organoid number and reduced the fraction of pro-SPC expressing organoids, indicating dysfunctional regeneration initiated by epithelial progenitors. In mouse PCLS alveolar marker gene expression declined, whereas airway markers were increased. The response of primary human fibroblasts to IL-11 on gene expression level was minimal, though bulk RNA-sequencing revealed IL-11 modulated a number of processes which may play a role in IPF, including unfolded protein response, glycolysis and Notch signaling.\n\nIn conclusion, IL-11 disrupts alveolar epithelial regeneration by inhibiting progenitor activation and suppressing the formation of mature alveolar epithelial cells.

The neuro-repellent, SLIT2, potently inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis, and might therefore be expected to impair antibacterial responses. We report here that, unexpectedly, neutrophils exposed to the N-terminal SLIT2 (N-SLIT2) fragment kill extracellular S. aureus more efficiently. N-SLIT2 amplifies reactive oxygen species production in response to the bacteria by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase that in turn phosphorylates NCF1, an essential subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. N-SLIT2 also enhances exocytosis of secondary granules. In a murine model of S. aureus skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), local SLIT2 levels fall initially but increase subsequently, peaking {approx} 3 days after infection. Of note, neutralization of endogenous SLIT2 worsens SSTI. Temporal fluctuations in tissue SLIT2 levels may promote neutrophil recruitment and retention at the infection site and hasten bacterial clearance by augmenting neutrophil oxidative burst and degranulation.

Here via a mitochondria-targeted screen, we found that knockout (KO) of FBXL4, a mitochondrial disease gene, hyperactivates mitophagy at basal conditions.

We determined that FBXL4 functions as an integral outer-membrane protein that forms an SCF-FBXL4 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. SCF-FBXL4 ubiquitinates BNIP3 and NIX to target them for degradation. Pathogenic FBXL4 mutations disrupt SCF-FBXL4 assembly and impair substrate degradation. Fbxl4-/- mice exhibit elevated BNIP3 and NIX proteins, hyperactive mitophagy, and perinatal lethality. Importantly, knockout of either Bnip3 or Nix rescues metabolic derangements and viability of the Fbxl4-/- mice.

    "abstract": "Katanin microtubule severing enzymes are potent M-phase regulators in oocytes and somatic cells. How the complex, and evolutionarily critical, male mammalian meiotic spindle is sculpted remains unknown. Here, using multiple single and double gene knockout mice, we reveal that the canonical katanin A-subunit, KATNA1, and its close paralogue, KATNAL1, together execute multiple aspects of meiosis. We show KATNA1 and KATNAL1 collectively regulate the male meiotic spindle, cytokinesis and midbody abscission, in addition to diverse spermatid remodelling events, including Golgi organisation, and acrosome and manchette formation. We also define KATNAL1-specific roles in sperm flagella development, manchette regulation, and sperm-epithelial disengagement. Finally, using proteomic approaches we define the KATNA1, KATNAL1, and KATNB1 mammalian testis interactome, which includes a network of cytoskeletal and vesicle trafficking proteins. Collectively, we reveal the presence of multiple katanin A-subunit paralogs in mammalian spermatogenesis allows for  customized cutting via neofunctionalization and protective buffering via gene redundancy.",

    "abstract": "Outer arm dynein (OAD) is the main force generator of ciliary beating. Although OAD loss is the most frequent cause of human primary ciliary dyskinesia, the docking mechanism of OAD onto the ciliary doublet microtubule (DMT) remains elusive in vertebrates. Here, we analyzed the functions of Calaxin/Efcab1 and Armc4, the components of vertebrate OAD-DC (docking complex), using zebrafish spermatozoa and cryo-electron tomography. Mutation of armc4 caused complete loss of OAD, whereas mutation of calaxin caused only partial loss of OAD. Detailed structural analysis revealed that calaxin-/- OADs are tethered to DMT through DC components other than Calaxin, and that recombinant Calaxin can autonomously rescue the deficient DC structure and the OAD instability. Our data demonstrate the discrete roles of Calaxin and Armc4 in the OAD-DMT interaction, suggesting the stabilizing process of OAD docking onto DMT in vertebrates.",

This suggests that the developing limb is plastic yet has a bias towards proximo-distal patterning. Here we use a minor spliceosome-deficient (U11-null) mouse forelimb, which has severe micromelia yet maintains proximo-distal segmentation, to decipher the mechanism(s) underlying this form of developmental robustness. We show that U11 loss triggers transcriptomic stalling upon spatially heterogenous mis-splicing of minor intron-containing genes. Through spatial transcriptomics, we detected a failure of the U11-null forelimb to separate its distal patterning program from its proximal differentiation program, which was supported by single-cell RNAseq-determined developmental delay of U11-null chondroprogenitors. Ultimately, these molecular and cellular deficits culminated in perturbed chondrogenesis, myogenesis, and axonogenesis. Taken together, we suggest that, upon sensing depletion of progenitors, the limb halts its transcriptional networks to pause its cellular trajectory, affording time to restructure its developmental program.",

    "abstract": "Secreted morphogen signals play a key role in the determination of cell fates during embryonic development. BMP signaling is essential for mammalian gastrulation, as it initiates a cascade of signals that controls the self-organized patterning of the three germ layers. Although morphogen signals are typically thought to induce cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner, development is a highly dynamic process, so it is crucial to understand how time-dependent signaling affects cellular differentiation. Here we show that varying the duration of BMP signaling in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) leads to either cells remaining pluripotent, or differentiating to mesodermal or extraembryonic states, while varying the concentration does not cause efficient mesodermal differentiation at any dose. Thus, there is a morphogen effect in time but not in concentration, and an appropriately timed pulse of BMP induces hPSCs to a mesodermal fate more efficiently than sustained signaling at any concentration. Using live cell imaging of signaling and cell fate reporters together with a simple mathematical model, we show that this effect is due to a combinatorial interpretation of the applied BMP signal and induced endogenous WNT signaling. Our findings have implications for how signaling pathways control the landscape of early human development.",

The pathophysiology of lung defects in CDH is poorly understood.\n\nObjectivesTo establish a translational model of human airway epithelium in CDH for pathogenic investigation and therapeutic testing.\n\nMethodsWe developed a robust methodology of epithelial progenitor derivation from tracheal aspirates of newborns. Basal stem cells (BSCs) from CDH patients and preterm and term, non-CDH controls were derived and analyzed by bulk RNA-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and air-liquidinterface differentiation. Lung sections from fetal human CDH samples and the nitrofen rat model of CDH were subjected to histological assessment of epithelial defects. Therapeutics to restore epithelial differentiation were evaluated in human epithelial cell culture and the nitrofen rat model of CDH.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsTranscriptomic and epigenetic profiling of CDH and non-CDH basal stem cells reveals a disease-specific, proinflammatory signature independent of severity or hernia size. In addition, CDH basal stem cells exhibit defective epithelial differentiation in vitro that recapitulates epithelial phenotypes found in fetal human CDH lung samples and fetal tracheas of the nitrofen rat model of CDH. Furthermore, steroid treatment normalizes epithelial differentiation phenotypes of human CDH basal stem cells in vitro and in nitrofen rat tracheas in vivo.\n\nConclusionsOur findings have identified an underlying proinflammatory signature and BSC differentiation defects as a potential therapeutic target for airway epithelial defects in CDH.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, the embryonic olfactory epithelium contains progenitors that will give rise to distinct classes of neurons, including olfactory sensory neurons (OSN, involved in odor detection), vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSN, responsible for pheromone sensing) and GnRH neurons that control the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Currently, these three neuronal lineages are usually believed to emerge from uniform pools of progenitors. Here we found that the homeodomain transcription factor Dbx1 is expressed by neurogenic progenitors in the developing and adult mouse olfactory epithelium. We demonstrate that Dbx1 itself is dispensable for neuronal fate specification and global organization of the olfactory sensory system. Using lineage tracing we characterize the contribution of Dbx1 lineages to OSN, VSN and GnRH neuron populations and reveal an unexpected degree of diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dbx1-expressing progenitors remain neurogenic in the absence of the proneural gene Ascl1. Our work therefore points to the existence of distinct neurogenic programs in Dbx1-derived and other olfactory lineages.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) are critical for the regulation of vascular barrier integrity and undergo dis-assembly during inflammatory injury, thus causing vascular leakiness. AJ re-assembly is thus necessary for restoration of the endothelial barrier following the initial injury. Here we examine the metabolic underpinnings that drive restoration of vascular integrity. In response to inflammatory stimuli, the glycolysis regulatory enzyme PFKFB3 is activated, resulting in a rapid and sustained increase of intracellular glycolytic ATP, especially in the proximity of AJs at the plasma membrane. We engineered a novel chemo-genetic construct (RapT) which allowed for precise temporal control of PFKFB3 recruitment to the plasma membrane. Activation of RapT by rapamycin during the barrier restoration phase increased regional ATP and accelerated AJ re-assembly. Mechanistically, we observed that PFKFB3 is activated through two modes. Src-mediated post-translational phosphorylation rapidly increases PFKFB3 activity. Using another chemo-genetic approach to temporally control Src activity, we found that Src activates PFKFB3 by binding to and phosphorylating it at residues Y175, Y334, and Y363. Tyrosine-phospho-deficient mutants of PFKFB3 at these residues block the glycolytic activation upon inflammatory stimuli. In parallel, elevated reactive oxygen species generated during inflammatory stimulation create pockets of regional hypoxia and allow for increased Hif1-mediated transcription of PFKFB3, leading to sustained glycolytic activation. Moreover, inhibition of PFKFB3 delays AJ reassembly and restoration of vascular integrity both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we show that while inflammatory activation acutely compromises the endothelial barrier, inflammatory signaling also concomitantly generates a metabolic milieu in anticipation of the subsequent re-assembly of AJs and restoration of the vascular barrier.",

    "abstract": "The protective and absorptive functions of the intestinal epithelium rely on differentiated enterocytes in the villi. The differentiation of enterocytes is orchestrated by sub-epithelial mesenchymal cells producing distinct ligands along the villus axis, in particular Bmps and Tgf{beta}. Here we show that individual Bmp ligands and Tgf{beta} drive distinct enterocytic programs specific to villus zonation. Bmp4 is expressed mainly from the center to the upper part of the villus, and it activates preferentially genes connected to lipid uptake and metabolism. In contrast, Bmp2 is produced by villus-tip mesenchymal cells, and it influences the adhesive properties of villus-tip epithelial cells and the expression of immunomodulators. Hence, Bmp2 promotes the terminal enterocytic differentiation at the villus-tip. Additionally, Tgf{beta} induces epithelial gene expression programs similar to that triggered by Bmp2. The inhibition of Bmp receptor type I in vivo and using intestinal organoids lacking Smad4 revealed that Bmp2-driven villus-tip program is activated by a canonical Smad-dependent mechanism. Finally, we established an organoid cultivation system that enriches for villus-tip enterocytes and thereby better mimics the cellular composition of the intestinal epithelium. Altogether our data suggest that not only Bmp gradient, but also the activity of individual Bmp drives specific enterocytic programs.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of both human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) were first sequenced over 20 years ago. Similar to HCMV, the MCMV genome had initially been proposed to harbor {approx}170 open reading frames (ORFs). More recently, omics approaches revealed HCMV gene expression to be substantially more complex comprising several hundreds of translated ORFs. Here, we provide a state-of-the art reannotation of lytic MCMV gene expression based on integrative analysis of a large set of omics data. Our data reveal 363 viral transcription start sites (TiSS) that give rise to 380 and 454 viral transcripts and ORFs, respectively. The latter include >200 small ORFs, some of which represented the most highly expressed viral gene products. By combining TiSS profiling with metabolic RNA labelling and chemical nucleotide conversion sequencing (dSLAM-seq), we provide a detailed picture of the expression kinetics of viral transcription. This not only resulted in the identification of a novel MCMV immediate early transcript encoding the m166.5 ORF, which we termed ie4, but also revealed a group of well-expressed viral transcripts that are induced later than canonical true late genes and contain an initiator element (Inr) but no TATA- or TATT-box in their core promoters. We show that viral uORFs tune gene expression of longer viral ORFs expressed in cis at translational level. Finally, we identify a truncated isoform of the viral NK-cell immune evasin m145 arising from a viral TiSS downstream of the canonical m145 mRNA. Despite being {approx}5-fold more abundantly expressed than the canonical m145 protein it was not required for downregulating the NK cell ligand, MULT-I. In summary, our work will pave the way for future mechanistic studies on previously unknown cytomegalovirus gene products in an important virus animal model.\n\nAuthor summaryWe conducted a comprehensive characterization and reannotation of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) gene expression during lytic infection in murine fibroblasts using an integrative multi-omics approach. This unveiled hundreds of novel transcripts that explained the expression of close to 300 so far unknown viral open reading frames (ORFs). Interestingly, small viral ORFs (sORFs) were amongst the most highly expressed viral gene products and thus presumably encode for important viral microproteins of unknown function. However, we also show that sORFs located upstream of larger ORFs tune the expression of the downstream ORFs at the level of translation. We classified viral transcription start sites (TiSS) based on their expression kinetics obtained by a new combination of metabolic RNA labelling with transcription start sites profiling. This not only identified a so far unknown viral immediate-early transcript (ie4, m166.5 RNA) but also revealed a novel class of viral late transcripts that are expressed later than canonical true late genes and lack TATA box-like motifs. We exemplify for the m145 locus how so far unknown TiSS give rise to abundantly expressed truncated viral proteins. In summary, we provide a state-of-the-art annotation of an important model virus, which will be instrumental for future studies on CMV biology, immunology and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, either chromosome duplication is coupled to cell division with only one replication round per cell cycle or DNA is replicated faster than the cells divide thus both processes are uncoupled. Here, we show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa switches from fast uncoupled to sustained coupled growth when cultivated under standard laboratory conditions. The transition was characterized by fast-paced, sequential changes in transcriptional activity along the ori-ter axis of the chromosome reflecting adaptation to the metabolic needs during both growth phases. Quorum sensing (QS) activity was highest at the onset of the coupled growth phase during which only a quarter of the cells keeps replicating. RNA sequencing of subpopulations of these cultures sorted based on their DNA content, revealed a strong gene dosage effect as well as specific expression patterns for replicating and non-replicating cells. Expression of flagella and mexE, involved in multi drug efflux was restricted to cells that did not replicate, while those that did showed a high activity of the cell division locus and recombination genes. A possible role of QS in the formation of these subpopulations upon switching to coupled growth could be a subject of further research.\n\nSignificance statementThe coordination of gene expression with the cell cycle has so far been studied only in a handful of bacteria, the bottleneck being the need for synchronized cultures. Here, we determined replication-associated effects on transcription by comparing Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures that differ in their growth mode and number of replicating chromosomes. We further show that cell cycle-specific gene regulation can be principally identified by RNA sequencing of subpopulations from cultures that replicate only once per cell division and that are sorted according to their DNA content. Our approach opens the possibility to study asynchronously growing bacteria from a wide phylogenetic range and thereby enhance our understanding of the evolution of cell-cycle control on the transcriptional level.",

    "abstract": "For anaerobic mixed cultures performing microbial chain elongation, it is unclear how pH alterations affect the abundance of key players, microbial interactions and community functioning in terms of medium-chain carboxylate yields. We explored pH effects on mixed cultures enriched in continuous anaerobic bioreactors representing closed model ecosystems. Increasing the pH from 5.5 to 6.0 caused fluctuations in community composition and yields of n-butyrate, n-caproate and n-caprylate. Further pH increase to 6.5 restored previous yield values while the community entered a new state characterized by lower diversity and evenness but apparently higher richness, indicating the presence of species below the detection threshold in the previous state. We applied Aitchison PCA clustering, linear mixed-effects models and random forest classification on our datasets. Different pH preferences of two key chain elongation species - one Clostridium IV species related to Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6, and one Clostridium sensu stricto species related to Clostridium luticellarii - were determined. Based on relative abundances measured by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, network analysis revealed positive correlations of Clostridium IV with lactic acid bacteria, which switched from Olsenella to Lactobacillus along the pH increase, illustrating the plasticity of the food web in chain elongation communities. The pH increase induced dramatic shifts in community composition whereas process performance (in terms of product range and yields) returned to the previous state. Despite long-term cultivation in closed systems over the pH shift experiment, the communities retained functional redundancy in fermentation pathways, reflected by the emergence of rare species and concomitant recovery of chain elongation functions.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have to persist in low iron conditions in order to adapt to hosts nutritional immunity. Since the knowledge of iron stimulon of Bacteroidetes is sparse, we examined oral (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) and gut (Bacteroides thataiotaomicron) representatives for their ability to adapt to iron deplete and iron replete conditions. Our transcriptomics and comparative genomics analysis shows that many iron-regulated mechanisms are conserved within the phylum. Those include genes upregulated in low iron: fldA (flavodoxin), hmu (hemin uptake operon) and loci encoding ABC transporters. Downregulated were: frd (ferredoxin), rbr (rubrerythrin), sdh (succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase), vor (oxoglutarate oxidoreductase/dehydrogenase), and pfor (pyruvate:ferredoxin/ flavodoxin oxidoreductase). Some genus-specific mechanisms, such as the B. thetaiotaomicrons sus coding for carbohydrate metabolism and the xusABC coding for xenosiderophore utilization, were also identified. While all bacteria tested in our study had the nrfAH operon coding for nitrite reduction and were able to reduce nitrite levels present in culture media, the expression of the operon was iron dependent only in B. thetaiotaomicron. It is noteworthy that we identified a significant overlap between regulated genes found in our study and the B. thetaiotaomicron colitis study (Zhu et al; Cell Host Microbe 27: 376-388). Many of those commonly regulated genes were also iron regulated in the oral bacterial genera. Overall, this work points to iron being the master regulator enabling bacterial persistence in the host and paves the way for more generalized investigation of the molecular mechanisms of iron homeostasis in Bacteroidetes.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces spp. are well-known producers of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) that serve as pharmaceutical agents. In addition to their ability to produce SMs, Streptomyces spp. have evolved diverse membrane transport systems to protect cells against antibiotics produced by itself or other microorganisms. We previously screened mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor that show a phenotype of reduced undecylprodigiosin (RED) production in a combined-culture with Tsukamurella pulmonis. Here, we identified a point mutation, which reduced RED production, by performing genome resequencing and genetic complementation. We found that inactivation of the sco1718 gene encoding the TetR family transcriptional regulator (TFR) produced a deficient phenotype for several SMs in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR experiments demonstrated that SCO1718 repressed the expression of adjacent two-component ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes (sco1719-20) by binding to the operator sequence in the 5'-UTR. Notably, the {Delta}sco1718 mutant showed increased resistance to several antibiotics of other actinomycete origin. In the genome of S. coelicolor A3(2), two other sets of TFR and two-component ABC transporter genes (sco4358-4360 and sco5384-5382) were found, which had similar effects on the phenotype for both secondary metabolism and antibiotic resistance. Our results imply the switching of cell metabolism to direct offence (antibiotic production) or defense (efflux pump activation) using costly and limited quantities of cell energy sources (e.g., ATP) in the soil ecosystem.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe bacterial metabolic potential to synthesize diverse secondary metabolites (SMs) in the environment has been revealed by recent (meta-)genomics of both unculturable and culturable bacteria. These studies imply that bacteria are continuously exposed to harmful chemical compounds in the environment. Streptomyces spp. contain antibiotic efflux pumps and SM biosynthetic gene clusters. However, the mechanism by which soil bacteria, including Streptomyces, survive against toxic compounds in the environment remains unclear. Here, we identified three sets of TFR-ABC transporter genes in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). We found that each TFR controlled the expression of a respective ABC transporter, and the expression of all ABC transporters negatively impacted SM production and increased antibiotic resistance. Notably, bioinformatic analysis indicated that these TFR-ABC transporter gene sets are highly conserved and widely distributed in the genome of Streptomyces species, indicating the importance of systematic regulation that directs antibiotic production and xenobiotic excretion.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a leading risk factor for progression and metastasis of many cancers1,2, yet can also promote improved survival for some cancers3-5 and enhance responses to some immune checkpoint blockade therapies6-8. The role of the immune system in the obesity-cancer connection and how obesity influences immunotherapy, however, remain unclear. While PD-1 expression by macrophages has been described9-12, we found that obesity selectively induced PD-1 on macrophages and that PD-1 directly impaired macrophage function. Single cell RNA sequencing of murine colorectal carcinoma tumors showed obesity remodeled myeloid and T cell populations, with fewer clonally expanded effector T cells and increased abundance of PD-1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Cytokines and molecules associated with obesity, including IL-6, leptin, and insulin, and the unsaturated fatty acid palmitate, induced PD-1 expression on macrophages in a glycolysis-dependent manner. PD-1+ TAMs had increased mitochondrial respiration and expression of genes regulating oxidative phosphorylation, lipid uptake and cell cycle while PD-1- TAMs showed greater signatures of phagocytosis and antigen presentation to T cells. These patterns were directly regulated by PD-1, as recombinant PD-L1 reduced macrophage glycolysis and phagocytic capacity, and this was reversed with blocking PD-1 antibody. Conversely, PD-1-deficient Pdcd1-/- TAMs had high rates of glycolysis, phagocytosis, and expression of MHC-II. Myeloid-specific PD-1 deficiency correlated with slower tumor growth, enhanced TAM antigen presentation capability, and increased CD8 T cell activation together with reduced markers of exhaustion. These findings show metabolic signaling in obesity induces PD-1-mediated suppression of TAM function and reveal a unique macrophage-specific mechanism to modulate immune tumor surveillance and checkpoint blockade. This may contribute to increased cancer risk yet improved response to PD-1 blockade in TAM-enriched tumors and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Since the first human case in 2013, H7N9 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have caused more than 1500 human infections with a mortality rate of approximately 40%. Despite large-scale poultry vaccination regimes across China, the H7N9 AIVs continue to persist and evolve rapidly in poultry. Recently, several strains of H7N9 AIVs have been isolated and shown the ability to escape vaccine-induced immunity. To assess the zoonotic risk of the recent H7N9 AIV isolates, we rescued viruses with hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from these H7N9 AIVs and six internal segments from PR8 virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 [H1N1]) and characterized their receptor binding, pH of fusion, thermal stability, plaque morphology and in ovo virus replication. We also assessed the cross-reactivity of the viruses with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against H7N9 HA and ferret antisera against H7N9 AIV candidate vaccines. The H7N9 AIVs from the early epidemic waves had dual sialic acid receptor binding characteristics, whereas the more recent H7N9 AIVs completely lost or retained only weak human sialic acid receptor binding. Compared with the H7N9 AIVs from early epidemic waves (2013-2016), the recent (2020/21) viruses formed larger plaques and increased replication titres in ovo, demonstrating increased acid stability but reduced thermal stability. Further analysis showed that these recent H7N9 AIVs had poor cross-reactivity with the human mAbs and ferret antisera, highlighting the need to update the vaccine candidates. To conclude, the newly emerged H7N9 AIVs showed characteristics of typical AIVs, posing reduced zoonotic risk but a heightened threat for poultry.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are known to co-opt host machinery for translation initiation, but less is known about which host factors are required for the formation of ribosomes used to synthesize viral proteins. Using a loss of function CRISPR screen, we show that synthesis of a flavivirus encoded reporter depends on multiple host factors, including several 60S ribosome biogenesis proteins. Viral phenotyping revealed that two of these factors, SBDS, a known ribosome biogenesis factor, and the relatively uncharacterized protein SPATA5, were broadly required for replication of flaviviruses, coronaviruses, alphaviruses, paramyxoviruses, an enterovirus, and a poxvirus. Mechanistic studies revealed that loss of SPATA5 caused defects in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly, suggesting that this human protein may be a functional ortholog of yeast Drg1. These studies implicate specific ribosome biogenesis proteins as viral host dependency factors that are required for synthesis of virally encoded protein and accordingly, optimal viral replication.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria accumulate compatible solutes, to maintain cellular turgor pressure when exposed to high salinity. In the marine halophile Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the compatible solute ectoine is biosynthesized de novo, which is energetically more costly than uptake; therefore, tight regulation is required. To uncover novel regulators of the ectoine biosynthesis ectABC-asp_ect operon, a DNA affinity pulldown of proteins interacting with the ectABC-asp_ect regulatory region was performed. Mass spectrometry analysis identified, amongst others, three regulators: LeuO, NhaR, and the nucleoid associated protein H-NS. In-frame non-polar deletions were made for each gene and PectA-gfp promoter reporter assays were performed in exponential and stationary phase cells. PectA-gfp expression was significantly repressed in the {Delta}leuO mutant and significantly induced in the {Delta}nhaR mutant compared to wild type, suggesting positive and negative regulation, respectively. In the {Delta}hns mutant, PectA-gfp showed increased expression in exponential phase cells, but no change compared to wild type in stationary phase cells. To examine whether H-NS interacts with LeuO or NhaR at the ectoine regulatory region, double deletion mutants were created. In a {Delta}leuO/{Delta}hns mutant, PectA-gfp showed reduced expression, but significantly more than {Delta}leuO suggesting H-NS and LeuO interact to regulate ectoine expression. Whereas {Delta}nhaR/{Delta}hns had no additional effect as compared to {Delta}nhaR suggesting NhaR regulation is independent of H-NS. To examine leuO regulation further, a PleuO-gfp reporter analysis was examined that showed significantly increased expression in the {Delta}leuO, {Delta}hns and {Delta}leuO/{Delta}hns mutants as compared to wild type, indicating both are repressors. Growth pattern analysis of the mutants in M9G 6%NaCl, showed growth defects compared to wild type, indicating that these regulators play an important physiological role in salinity stress tolerance.\n\nImportanceEctoine is a commercially used compatible solute that acts as a biomolecule stabilizer because of its additional role as a chemical chaperone. A better understanding of how the ectoine biosynthetic pathway is regulated in natural bacterial producers can be used to increase efficient industrial production. The de novo biosynthesis of ectoine is essential for bacteria to survive osmotic stress when exogenous compatible solutes are absent. This study identified LeuO as a positive regulator and NhaR as a negative regulator of ectoine biosynthesis and also showed that similar to enteric species, LeuO is an anti-silencer of H-NS. In addition, defects in growth in high salinity among all the mutants suggest that these regulators play a broader role in the osmotic stress response beyond ectoine biosynthesis regulation.",

    "abstract": "Several genera of desert ants have adapted to endure prolonged exposure to high temperatures. The study of these ants is essential to unravel how species respond and adapt to thermal stress. We investigated the thermal tolerance and the transcriptomic heat stress response of three desert ant genera (Cataglyphis, Melophorus and Ocymyrmex) and two temperate genera (Formica and Myrmica) to explore convergent and specific adaptations. We found a variable transcriptomic response among desert species exposed to similar levels of physiological heat-stress: Cataglyphis holgerseni and Melophorus bagoti differentially regulated very few transcripts, 0.12% (54/44,525) and 0.14% (53/38,726) respectively, while Cataglyphis bombycina and Ocymyrmex robustior showed greater expression alterations affecting 0.6% (253/41,912) and 1.53% (698/45,701) of their transcriptomes, respectively. These two responsive mechanisms - reactive and constitutive - were related to desert species thermal tolerance survival pattern and convergently evolved in distinct desert ant genera. By comparison, the two temperate species differentially expressed thousands of transcripts more than desert ants in response to heat stress (affecting 8% and 12,71% of F. fusca and Myr. sabuleti transcriptomes), suggesting that keeping restrained gene expression is an important adaptation in heat adapted species. Finally, we found a significant overlap of the molecular pathways activated in response to heat-stress in temperate and desert species, and our data revealed that larger gene expression responses also affected a greater number of taxonomically restricted genes. These results suggest that the molecular processes involved in heat-stress response are mostly evolutionary conserved in ants, but new genes may also play a role.",

That means a local biofilm site with specific characteristics can attract barnacle larva to the maximum. If this is true, a barnacle already growing up shall still press down a chunk of biofilm area where it settles when it was a crypid. The chunk of biofilm should be at the center of barnacle footprint and may still contain most of the microbes at the attachment site. By this consideration, a group of such chunks of barnacle cement (with about 2mm diameter) was collected from the center of barnacle footprints, followed by genomic DNA extraction, PCR amplification with primers representing prokaryotes, eukaryotes, archaea and fungus, DNA sequencing and species determination. The most abundant 13 species were preliminarily determined (mainly fungi). Whether they are really wanted target microbes largely depends on future investigations on whether they possess some common features that can attract barnacle crypids.",

To investigate the possible role of SETD2 in IBD, we generated and genotyped epithelium-specific deletion of Setd2 (Setd2Vil-KO) progeny mice to establish mice IBD pathology model and then studied molecular expression differences at mRNA and protein levels in the intestinal epithelial tissue of Setd2Vil-KO mice. Compared with Setd2F/F mice, the tissue of Setd2Vil-KO mice showed increases in oxidative stress and cell apoptosis level via RT-qPCR, while TUNEL assay and immunofluorescence showed significantly enhanced apoptotic signaling and FasL expression. Together, our findings highlight that SETD2 regulates oxidative stress and FasL-induced apoptosis in Setd2Vil-KO mice intestinal epithelial cells through epigenetics mechanisms, which plays an essential role in IBD pathogenesis. Therefore, our study provides new insights into the prevention and therapy of IBD from the perspective of epigenetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "The soil-dwelling plant symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti is a major model organism of Alphaproteobacteria. Despite numerous detailed OMICS studies, information about small open reading frame (sORF)-encoded proteins (SEPs) is largely missing, because sORFs are poorly annotated, and SEPs are hard to detect experimentally. However, given that SEPs can fulfill important functions, cataloging the full complement of translated sORFs is critical for analyzing their roles in bacterial physiology. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) can detect translated sORFs with high sensitivity, but is not yet routinely applied to bacteria because it must be adapted for each species. Here, we established a Ribo-seq procedure for S. meliloti 2011 based on RNase I digestion and detected translation for 60% of the annotated coding sequences during growth in minimal medium. Using ORF prediction tools based on Ribo-seq data, subsequent filtering, and manual curation, the translation of 37 non-annotated sORFs with [&le;] 70 amino acids was predicted with high confidence. The Ribo-seq data were supplemented by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses from three sample preparation approaches and two integrated proteogenomic search databases (iPtgxDBs). Searches against a standard and a 20-fold smaller Ribo-seq data-informed custom iPtgxDB confirmed many annotated SEPs and identified 11 additional novel SEPs. Epitope tagging and Western blot analysis confirmed the translation of 15 out of 20 SEPs selected from the translatome map. Overall, by applying MS and Ribo-seq as complementary approaches, the small proteome of S. meliloti was substantially expanded by 48 novel SEPs. Several of them are conserved from Rhizobiaceae to Bacteria, suggesting important physiological functions.",

Here we elucidate the contribution of pathogen clade and host species in disease hotspots of Ophidiomyces ophidiicola, the pathogen that causes snake fungal disease, in 21 species of snakes infected with multiple pathogen strains across 10 countries in Europe.\n\n3. We found isolated areas of disease hotspots in a landscape where infections were otherwise low. O. ophidiicola clade had important effects on transmission, and areas with multiple pathogen clades had higher host infection prevalence. Snake species identity further influenced infection, with most positive detections coming from the Natrix genus. Most species present in the community only experienced increased levels of infection when multiple strains were present. However, one species, N. tessellata, appeared highly susceptible, having increased infection prevalence regardless of pathogen strain, indicating that this species may be important in pathogen maintenance.\n\n4. Our results suggest that both host and pathogen identity are essential components contributing to increased pathogen prevalence. More broadly, our findings indicate that coevolutionary relationships between hosts and pathogens may be key mechanisms explaining variation in landscape patterns of disease.",

    "abstract": "Strong sexual selection frequently leads to sexual conflict and ensuing male harm, whereby males increase their reproductive success at the expense of harming females. Male harm is a widespread evolutionary phenomenon with a strong bearing on population viability. Thus, understanding how it unfolds in the wild is a current priority. Here, we sampled a wild Drosophila melanogaster population and studied male harm across the normal range of temperatures under which it reproduces optimally in nature by comparing female lifetime reproductive success and underlying male harm mechanisms under monogamy (i.e., low male competition/harm) vs. polyandry (i.e., high male competition/harm). While females had equal lifetime reproductive success across temperatures under monogamy, polyandry resulted in a maximum decrease of female fitness at 24{degrees}C (35%), reducing its impact at both 20{degrees}C (22%), and 28{degrees}C (10%). Furthermore, female fitness components and pre- (i.e., harassment) and post-copulatory (i.e., ejaculate toxicity) mechanisms of male harm were asymmetrically affected by temperature. At 20{degrees}C, male harassment of females was reduced, and polyandry accelerated female actuarial ageing. In contrast, the effect of mating on female receptivity (a component of ejaculate toxicity) was affected at 28{degrees}C, where the mating costs for females decreased and polyandry mostly resulted in accelerated reproductive ageing. We thus show that, across a natural thermal range, sexual conflict processes and their effects on female fitness components are plastic and complex. As a result, the net effect of male harm on overall population viability is likely to be lower than previously surmised. We discuss how such plasticity may affect selection, adaptation and, ultimately, evolutionary rescue under a warming climate.",

While many vocal behaviors are highly conserved, heritable features of specific vocalization types can vary both within and between species, raising the questions of why and how some vocal behaviors evolve. Here, using new computational tools to automatically detect and cluster vocalizations into distinct acoustic categories, we compare pup isolation calls across neonatal development in eight taxa of deer mice (genus Peromyscus) and compare them to laboratory mice (C57Bl6/j strain) and free-living, wild house mice (Mus musculus musculus). Whereas both Peromyscus and Mus pups produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), Peromyscus pups also produce a second call type with acoustic features, temporal rhythms, and developmental trajectories that are distinct from those of USVs. In deer mice, these tonal and low frequency \"cries\" are predominantly emitted in postnatal days one through nine, while USVs are primarily made after day nine. Using playback assays, we show that cries result in a more rapid approach by Peromyscus mothers than USVs, suggesting a role for cries in eliciting parental care early in neonatal development. Using genetic crosses between two sister species of deer mice exhibiting large, innate differences in the acoustic structure of cries and USVs, we find that variation in vocalization rate, duration, and pitch display different degrees of genetic dominance and that cry and USV features can be uncoupled in second-generation hybrids. Taken together, this work shows that vocal behavior can evolve quickly between closely related rodent species in which vocalization types, likely serving distinct functions in communication, are controlled by distinct genetic loci.",

    "abstract": "Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, 90% of which is caused by loss of function of the endoplasmic reticular membrane protein Wolframin or WFS 1. Wolfram syndrome results in Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy, and Deafness (DIDMOAD) in humans. In mammalian cells WFS1 interacts with the ER-localised intracellular Ca2+ release channel, Inositol Trisphosphate Receptor 1 (IP3R1) required for IP3 mediated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nHere, we tested functional interactions between IP3R and WFS1 mutants in the context of organismal behaviour and neuronal mitochondrial morphology and physiology in a subset of central dopaminergic neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. We show strong genetic interactions between trans-heterozygotes of wfs1 and itpr (IP3R) mutants by measuring flight deficits. Over-expression of wild-type cDNAs of either interacting partner, wfs1+ or itpr+ rescued the flight deficits. Cellular studies demonstrate changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ entry accompanied by enlarged or swollen mitochondria and decreased mitochondrial content in genotypes that are flight defective. In wfs1 mutant as well as wfs1 knockdown conditions a reduction in the number of dopaminergic neurons was observed.\n\nThus, WFS1 interaction with the IP3R is required in flight regulating central dopaminergic neurons of Drosophila, for optimal mitochondrial Ca2+ entry and maintaining mitochondrial morphology. Our study demonstrates that Drosophila can be a good model system to understand the cellular and molecular basis of Wolfram syndrome, its impact on systemic physiology and suggests its use in testing putative pharmaceutical interventions.",

However, AFM images are distorted by the shape of the tip used. These distortions can be corrected if the tip shape can be determined by scanning a sample with features sharper than the tip and higher than the object of interest. Here we present a 3D DNA origami structure as fiducial for tip reconstruction and image correction. Our fiducial is stable under a broad range of conditions and has sharp steps at different heights that enable reliable tip reconstruction from as few as ten fiducials. The DNA origami is readily co-deposited with biological and non-biological samples, achieves higher precision for the tip apex than polycrystalline samples, and dramatically improves the accuracy of the lateral dimensions determined from the images. Our fiducial thus enables accurate and precise AFM imaging for a broad range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Janus kinases (JAK) are a group of proteins in the non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTKs) family that play a crucial role in growth, survival, and angiogenesis. They are activated by cytokines through the Janus kinase - signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway. JAK-STAT signaling pathways have significant roles in the regulation of cell division, apoptosis, and immunity. Identification of the V617F mutation in the Janus homology 2 (JH2) domain of JAK2 leading to myeloproliferative disorders has stimulated great interest in the drug discovery community to develop JAK2-specific inhibitors. However, such inhibitors should be selective towards JAK2 over other JAKs and display an extended residence time. Recently, novel JAK2/STAT5 axis inhibitors (N-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amino derivatives) have displayed extended residence times (hours or longer) on target and adequate selectivity excluding JAK3. To facilitate a deeper understanding of the kinase-inhibitor interactions and advance the development of such inhibitors, we utilize a multiscale Markovian milestoning with Voronoi tessellations (MMVT) approach within the Simulation-Enabled Estimation of Kinetic Rates v.2 (SEEKR2) program to rank-order these inhibitors based on their kinetic properties and further explain the selectivity of JAK2 inhibitors over JAK3. Our approach investigates the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of JAK-inhibitor complexes in a user-friendly, fast, efficient, and accurate manner compared to other brute force and hybrid enhanced sampling approaches.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly gaining interest as biomarkers and therapeutics. Accurate sizing and quantification of EVs remain problematic, given their nanometer size range and small scattering cross-sections. This is compounded by the fact that common EV isolation methods result in co-isolation of particles with comparable features. Especially in blood plasma, similarly-sized lipoproteins outnumber EVs to a great extent. Recently, interferometric nanoparticle tracking analysis (iNTA) was introduced as a particle analysis method that enables determining the size and refractive index of nanoparticles with high sensitivity and precision. In this work, we apply iNTA to differentiate between EVs and lipoproteins, and compare its performance to conventional nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). We show that iNTA can accurately quantify EVs in artificial EV-lipoprotein mixtures and in plasma-derived EV samples of varying complexity. Conventional NTA could not report on EV numbers, as it was not able to distinguish between EVs and lipoproteins. iNTA has the potential to become a new standard for label-free EV characterization in suspension.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype for which no effective targeted therapies are available. Growing evidence suggests that chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells with stem-like properties (CSC) may repopulate the tumor. Androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in up to 50% of TNBC, and AR inhibition decreases CSC and tumor initiation. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) correlates with poor prognosis in TNBC and is regulated by AR in prostate cancer. Our group has shown that RUNX1 promotes TNBC cell migration and regulates tumor gene expression. We hypothesized that RUNX1 is regulated by AR and that both may work together in TNBC CSC to promote disease recurrence following chemotherapy. Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments in MDA-MB-453 revealed AR binding to RUNX1 regulatory regions. RUNX1 expression is upregulated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in MDA-MB-453 and in HCI-009 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors (p<0.05). RUNX1 is increased in a CSC-like experimental model in MDA-MB-453 and SUM-159PT cells (p<0.05). Inhibition of RUNX1 transcriptional activity reduced the expression of CSC markers. Interestingly, RUNX1 inhibition reduced cell viability and enhanced paclitaxel and enzalutamide sensitivity. Targeting RUNX1 may be an attractive strategy to potentiate the anti-tumor effects of AR inhibition, specifically in the slow growing CSC-like populations that resist chemotherapy leading to metastatic disease.",

    "abstract": "The small molecule inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), elimusertib, is currently being tested clinically in various cancer entities in adults and children. Its preclinical anti-tumor activity in pediatric malignancies, however, is largely unknown. We here assessed the preclinical activity of elimusertib in >40 cell lines and >30 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models derived from common pediatric solid tumor entities. Detailed in vitro and in vivo molecular characterization of the treated models enabled the evaluation of response biomarkers. Pronounced objective response rates were observed for elimusertib monotherapy in PDX, when treated with a regimen currently used in clinical trials. Strikingly, elimusertib outperformed standard of care chemotherapies, particularly in alveolar rhabdomysarcoma PDX. Thus, elimusertib has strong preclinical anti-tumor activity in pediatric solid tumor models, which may translate to clinically meaningful responses in patients.\n\nStatement of translational relevanceElimusertib is a small molecule inhibitor of ATR. ATR inhibitors have shown promising results as anticancer agents in adult cancers, but there is limited information on their effectiveness in pediatric solid tumors. Using a cohort of 32 patient-derived xenografts from pediatric solid tumors, we here evaluated the therapeutic potential of elimusertib in vivo. Elimusertib reduced tumor volume growth in all samples. Elimusertib had very limited toxicity and was potent even in tumors with preexisting chemoresistance. Our preclinical data indicates that elimusertib is a safe and potent therapeutic option for pediatric solid tumors. This data may serve as a rationale for the development of pediatric clinical trials for ATR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytoplasmic complex that senses molecular patterns from pathogens or damaged cells to trigger an innate immune defense response marked by the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta} and IL-18 and an inflammatory death called pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in the urinary tract by a variety of infectious and non-infectious insults. In this study, we investigated the role of NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ascending UTI in WT and Nlrp3-/- mice. At 24 and 72 hpi, compared to the WT, the MRSA-infected Nlrp3-/- showed [~]100-fold lower median CFUs, although this reduction was not statistically significant. The ablation of NLRP3 did not affect MRSA-induced urinary immune defenses as indicated by the similar levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the similar numbers of granulocytes in the bladder and the kidneys of WT and Nlrp3-/- mice at 24 h after MRSA infection. However, MRSA-infected Nlrp3-/- bladders, but not kidneys, showed significantly higher monocyte infiltration. The histopathological analysis of bladder and kidney sections showed similar inflammation in MRSA-infected Nlrp3-/- and WT mice. Overall, these results suggest that MRSA-induced urinary NLRP3 activity is dispensable to the host.\n\nImportanceIndwelling urinary catheter usage increased susceptibility to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) urinary tract infections (UTI) which can be difficult to treat and can result in potentially fatal complications such as bacteremia, urosepsis, and shock. In this work, we examined the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in MRSA uropathogenesis. In comparison to the WT, mice deficient in NLRP3 activity showed similar MRSA burden and similar inflammation in the bladder and kidney tissues at 24 h after the experimental induction of ascending UTI. These results suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome is not involved in shaping urinary immune defenses during acute MRSA-UTI.",

UTI healthcare costs are increasing due to the rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, necessitating alternative approaches for infection control. Here, we investigated whether host adaptive immune responses can influence infection outcomes. We employed a mouse model in which wild-type C57BL/6J mice were transurethrally inoculated with an MDR UTI strain of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Firstly, we noted that rag1-/- C57BL/6J mice harboured larger bacterial burdens than wild-type counterparts, consistent with a role for T and/or B cells in optimal control of UTI. Consistent with this, UTI triggered in the bladders of wild-type mice early increases of myeloid cells, including CD11chi conventional dendritic cells, suggesting possible involvement of these professional antigen-presenting cells. Importantly, germinal centre (GC) B cell responses developed by 4 weeks post-infection in bladder-draining lymph nodes of wild-type mice, and although modest in magnitude and transient in nature, could not be boosted with a second UTI. Thus, our data reveal for the first time in a mouse model, that Gram-negative bacterial UTI induces local B cell immune responses in bladder-draining lymph nodes, which could potentially serve to control infection.",

Here, we describe key drivers by combining viral genome sequences with epidemiological data and possible factors of spread into phylodynamic models. WNV in Europe has greater lineage diversity than other regions of the world, suggesting repeated introductions and local amplification. Among the six lineages found in Europe, WNV-2a is predominant, has spread to at least 14 countries and evolved into two major co-circulating clusters (A and B). Both of these seem to originate from regions of Central Europe. Viruses of Cluster A emerged earlier and have spread towards the west of Europe with higher genetic diversity. Amongst multiple drivers, high agriculture activities were associated with both spread direction and velocity. Our study suggests future surveillance activities should be strengthened in Central Europe and Southeast European countries, and enhanced monitoring should be targeted to areas with high agriculture activities.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical emergency characterized by severe muscle damage resulting in the release of intracellular muscle components leading to myoglobinuria and in severe cases, acute kidney failure. Rhabdomyolysis is caused by genetic factors that are linked to increased disease susceptibility in response to extrinsic triggers. Recessive mutations in TANGO2 result in episodic rhabdomyolysis, metabolic crises, encephalopathy and cardiac arrhythmia, the underlying mechanism contributing to disease onset in response to specific triggers remains unclear. To address these challenges, we created a zebrafish model of Tango2 deficiency. Here we show that loss of Tango2 in zebrafish results in growth defects, early lethality and increased susceptibility of muscle defects similar to TANGO2 patients. Detailed analyses of skeletal muscle revealed defects in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria at the onset of disease development. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) constitutes the primary lipid biosynthesis site and regulates calcium handling in skeletal muscle to control excitation-contraction coupling. Tango2 deficient SR exhibits increased sensitivity to calcium release that was partly restored by inhibition of Ryr1-mediated Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle. Using lipidomics, we identified alterations in the glycerolipid state of tango2 mutants which is critical for membrane stability and energy balance. Therefore, these studies provide insight into key disease processes in Tango2 deficiency and increased our understanding of how specific defects can predispose to environmental triggers in TANGO2-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental multi-step cellular process in all domains of life that involves the production, processing, folding, and modification of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and ribosomal proteins. To obtain insights into the still unexplored early assembly phase of the bacterial 50S subunit, we exploited a minimal in vitro reconstitution system using purified ribosomal components and scalable reaction conditions. Time-limited assembly assays combined with cryo-EM analysis visualizes the structurally complex assembly pathway starting with a particle consisting of ordered density for only [~]500 nucleotides of 23S rRNA domain I and three ribosomal proteins. In addition, our structural analysis reveals that early 50S assembly occurs in a domain-wise fashion, while late 50S assembly proceeds incrementally. Furthermore, we find that both ribosomal proteins and folded rRNA helices, occupying surface exposed regions on pre-50S particles, induce, or stabilize rRNA folds within adjacent regions, thereby creating cooperativity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe prevalence of thrombus and use of anticoagulants is routine in clinical cardiology practice. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and/or Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are used for resolution of the thrombus. Despite similar anticoagulation efficacy, use of DOAC is preferred due to their superior safety margin and reduced risk of bleeding. Currently the following DOAC are available for the prevention of thrombosis, i.e., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban. This study evaluates the comparative pharmacology of these DOAC and VKA to assess clinical preference.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe human specific targets of DOAC and VKA (Warfarin) were identified from the SwissTargetPrediction server and analysed for their affinity. The targets were subclassified into functional categories and the relative proportion of each of the functional categories among the total number of targets was estimated. A novel concentration affinity (CA) ratio system was developed for the drugs to assess their safety margin and compared.\n\nResultsThe following targets were identified has high affinity targets of DOAC or VKA i.e., coagulation factor X, hERG, matriptase, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1, plasminogen, quinone reductase 1 & 2, serine protease hepsin, solute carrier family 22 member 2 and thrombin. Apixaban and rivaroxaban were observed to have superior anticoagulation pharmacology compared to the other DOAC or VKA. Edoxaban and betrixaban were observed to have affinity against hERG, which carries the risk of prolonging QT interval and triggering ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\n\nConclusionThis study shows the comparative pharmacology of DOAC and VKA and suggests preferential use of apixaban or rivaroxaban due to their superior pharmacodynamic effects and wider safety margin.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian male germ cell differentiation relies on complex RNA biogenesis events, many of which occur in RNA binding protein (RBP) rich non-membrane bound organelles termed RNA germ cell granules. Though known to be required for male germ cell differentiation, little is understood of the relationships between and functions of the numerous granule subtypes. ADAD2, a testis specific RBP, is required for normal male fertility and forms a poorly characterized granule in meiotic male germ cells. This work aimed to define the role of ADAD2 granules in male germ cell differentiation and their relationship to other granules. Biochemical analyses identified RNF17, a testis specific RBP that forms meiotic male germ cell granules, as an ADAD2-interacting protein. Phenotypic analysis of Adad2 and Rnf17 mutant mice defined a shared and rare post-meiotic chromatin defect, suggesting shared biological roles. We further demonstrated ADAD2 and RNF17 are dependent on one another for granularization and together form a previously unstudied set of germ cell granules. Based on co-localization studies with well-characterized granule RBPs including DDX4 and PIWIL1, a subset of the ADAD2-RNF17 granules are likely components of the piRNA pathway. In contrast, a second, morphologically distinct population of ADAD2-RNF17 co-localize with the translation regulator NANOS1 and form a unique cup-shaped structure with distinct protein subdomains. This cup shape appears to be driven, in part, by association with the endoplasmic reticulum. Lastly, a double Adad2-Rnf17 mutant model demonstrated loss of ADAD2-RNF17 granules themselves, as opposed to loss of either ADAD2 or RNF17, is the likely driver of the Adad2 and Rnf17 mutant phenotypes. Together, this work identified a set of novel germ cell granules required for male fertility and sheds light on the relationship between germ cell granule pools. The example described here defines a new genetic approach to germ cell granule study.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTo differentiate successfully, male germ cells tightly regulate their RNA pools. As such, they rely on RNA binding proteins, which often localize to cytoplasmic granules. The majority of studies have focused on a single granule type which regulates small-RNA biogenesis. Although additional granules have been identified, there is limited knowledge about their relationship to each other and exact functions. Here, we identify an interaction between two RNA binding proteins, ADAD2 and RNF17, and demonstrate mutants share a rare germ cell phenotype. Further, ADAD2 and RNF17 colocalize to the same germ cell granule, which displays two morphologically unique types. The first subset of ADAD2-RNF17 granules have similar morphologies to other characterized granules and likely play a role in the small-RNA pathway. The second granule type forms a unique shape with distinct protein subdomains. This second population appears to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Genetic models further demonstrate the granules themselves, as opposed to the resident proteins, likely drive the mutant phenotypes. These findings not only identify a novel population of germ cell granules but reveal a new genetic approach to defining their formation and function during germ cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic sensing is a crucial prerequisite for cells to adjust their physiology to rapidly changing environments. In bacteria, the response to intra- and extra-cellular ligands is primarily controlled by transcriptional regulators, which activate or repress gene expression to ensure metabolic acclimation. Translational control, such as ribosomal stalling can also contribute to cellular acclimation and has been shown to mediate responses to changing intracellular molecules. In the current study, we demonstrate that co-translational export of the protein CutF regulates translation of the down-stream cutO-encoded multi-copper oxidase CutO in response to extracellular copper (Cu). Our data show that CutF, acting as a Cu sensor, is co-translationally exported by the signal recognition particle pathway. Binding of Cu to the periplasmically exposed Cu-binding motif of CutF delays its co-translational export via its C-terminal ribosome stalling-like motif. This allows the unfolding of an mRNA stem-loop sequence that shields the ribosome-binding site of cutO, which favors its subsequent translation. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that CutF-like proteins are widely distributed in bacteria and often, are located upstream of genes involved in transition metal homeostasis. Our overall findings illustrate a highly conserved control mechanism using co-translational export of a protein acting as a sensor to integrate the changing availability of extracellular nutrients into metabolic acclimation.\n\nImportanceMetabolite sensing is a fundamental biological process, and the perception of dynamic changes in the extracellular environment is of paramount importance for the survival of organisms. Bacteria usually adjust their metabolism to changing environments by transcriptional regulation. Here, we describe an alternative translational mechanism that controls the bacterial response to the presence of copper, a toxic micronutrient. This mechanism involves a co-translationally secreted protein that, in the presence of copper, undergoes a process resembling ribosomal stalling. This allows the unfolding of a downstream mRNA stem-loop and enables translation of the adjacent Cu-detoxifying multicopper oxidase. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that such proteins are widespread, suggesting that metabolic sensing using ribosome-arrested nascent secreted proteins acting as sensors may be a common strategy for integrating environmental signals into metabolic adaptation.",
