    "abstract": "Despite their involvement in many cognitive functions, beta oscillations are among the least understood brain rhythms. Reports on whether the functional role of beta is primarily inhibitory or excitatory have been contradictory. Our framework attempts to reconcile these findings and proposes that several beta rhythms co-exist at different frequencies. Beta frequency shifts and their potential influence on behavior have thus far received little attention. In this magnetoencephalography experiment, we asked whether changes in beta power or frequency in auditory cortex and motor cortex influence behavior (reaction times) during an auditory sweep discrimination task. We found that in motor cortex, increased beta power slowed down responses, while in auditory cortex, increased beta frequency slowed down responses. We further characterized beta as transient burst events with distinct spectro-temporal profiles influencing reaction times. Finally, we found that increased motor-to-auditory beta connectivity also slowed down responses. In sum, beta power, frequency, bursting properties, cortical focus, and connectivity profile all influenced behavioral outcomes. Our results imply that the study of beta oscillations requires caution as beta dynamics are multifaceted phenomena, and that several dynamics must be taken into account to reconcile mixed findings in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive processes and neurocognitive disorders are regulated by astrocytes and have prominent sex differences. However, the contribution of astrocytes to sex differences is not known. We leveraged astrocyte-targeted gene editing and chemogenetics in adult mice to reveal that astrocytic glutamate receptors and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in a sexually dimorphic manner. In females, spatial memory was improved by increasing metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3) in astrocytes or stimulating astrocytic Gi/o-coupled signaling, whereas stimulating Gs-coupled signaling impaired memory. However, in males, memory was improved by reducing mGluR3 or stimulating Gs-coupled signaling, whereas stimulating Gi/o-coupled signaling impaired memory. Thus, memory requires a sex-specific balance of astrocytic Gs-coupled and Gi/o-coupled receptor activities, and disease-associated alterations or therapeutic targeting of these pathways may cause opposing sex-dependent effects on cognitive function.\n\nSummaryGlia cause sex-specific changes in cognition",

    "abstract": "Human brain size increases dynamically through early development, peaks in adolescence, and varies up to two-fold among adults. Although previous studies have elucidated changes in brain size across evolution, development, traits, and diseases, the molecular underpinnings of interindividual variation in brain size remain unknown. Here, we leverage postmortem brain RNA sequencing and estimates of brain weight (BW) in 2,531 individuals across three independent datasets, to identify 928 genes that show genome-wide significant associations with either higher or lower BW (BW+, BW-, respectively). These BW gene sets showed distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories and spatial patterns that mapped onto developmental, functional and cellular axes of brain organization. Expression differences among evolutionarily conserved BW genes were predictive of interspecies differences in brain size, and functional annotation of BW genes revealed enrichment for neurogenesis and cell-cell communication. Genome-wide, transcriptome-wide, and phenome-wide association analyses of in vivo neuroimaging phenotypes confirmed that the genetic regulation of BW-transcripts influences cortical surface area and volume, as well as behavioral traits related to brain function and disease. Cumulatively, our study represents a major step towards the goal of delineating the causal mechanisms of human brain size variation in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "When making decisions, humans can evaluate how likely they are to be correct. If this subjective confidence could be reliably decoded from brain activity, it would be possible to build a brain-computer interface (BCI) that improves decision performance by automatically providing more information to the user if needed based on their confidence. But this possibility depends on whether confidence can be decoded right after stimulus presentation and before the response so that a corrective action can be taken in time. Although prior work has shown that decision confidence is represented in brain signals, it is unclear if the representation is stimulus-locked or response-locked, and whether stimulus-locked pre-response decoding is sufficiently accurate for enabling such a BCI. We investigate the neural correlates of confidence by collecting high-density EEG during a perceptual decision task with realistic stimuli. Importantly, we design our task to include a post-stimulus gap that prevents the confounding of stimulus-locked activity by response-locked activity and vice versa, and then compare with a task without this gap. We perform event-related potential (ERP) and source-localization analyses. Our analyses suggest that the neural correlates of confidence are stimulus-locked, and that an absence of a post-stimulus gap could cause these correlates to incorrectly appear as response-locked. By preventing response-related activity to confound stimulus-locked activity, we then show that confidence can be reliably decoded from single-trial stimulus-locked pre-response EEG alone. We also identify a high-performance classification algorithm by comparing a battery of algorithms. Lastly, we design a simulated BCI framework to show that the EEG classification is accurate enough to build a BCI and that the decoded confidence could be used to improve decision making performance particularly when the task difficulty and cost of errors are high. Our results show feasibility of non-invasive EEG-based BCIs to improve human decision making.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning frameworks utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have frequently been used for brain age prediction and have achieved outstanding performance. Nevertheless, deep learning remains a black box as it is hard to interpret which brain parts contribute significantly to the predictions. To tackle this challenge, we first trained a lightweight, fully CNN model for brain age estimation on a large sample data set (N = 3054, age range = [8,80 years]) and tested it on an independent data set (N = 555, mean absolute error (MAE) = 4.45 years, r = 0.96). We then developed an interpretable scheme combining network occlusion sensitivity analysis (NOSA) with a fine-grained human brain atlas to uncover the learned invariance of the model. Our findings show that the dorsolateral, dorsomedial frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus had the highest contributions to age prediction across the lifespan. More interestingly, we observed that different regions showed divergent patterns in their predictions for specific age groups and that the bilateral hemispheres contributed differently to the predictions. Regions in the frontal lobe were essential predictors in both the developmental and aging stages with the thalamus remaining relatively stable and saliently correlated with other regional changes throughout the lifespan. The lateral and medial temporal brain regions gradually became involved during the aging phase. At the network level, the frontoparietal and the default mode networks show an inverted U-shape contribution from the developmental to the aging stages. The framework could identify regional contributions to the brain age prediction model, which could help increase the model interpretability when serving as an aging biomarker.",

Simultaneous EEG/fMRI data were acquired from 17 healthy individuals listening to pleasurable music, and used to construct a one-class regression model for predicting the reward-related VS-BOLD signal using spectro-temporal features from the EEG. Validation analyses, applied on EEG/fMRI data from a different group (N=14), revealed that the EEG model predicted VS-BOLD activation from the simultaneous EEG to a greater extent than a model derived from another anatomical region. The VS-EEG-model was also modulated by musical pleasure and predictive of the VS-BOLD during a monetary reward task, further indicating it functional relevance. These findings provide compelling evidence for the use of a scalable yet precise EEG-only probe of VS-originated reward processing, which could serve for process specific neruo-monitoring and -modulation.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the progressive loss of both upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Currently, there are only two drugs, Riluzole (Rilutek) and Edaravone (Radicava), approved by FDA for ALS treatment. These two drugs are very expensive with only a few months of life extension. So far, there is no cure for ALS. Aberrant protein aggregation in motor neurons is an intracellular hallmark of ALS. The disturbance in protein homeostasis may contribute to the onset and progression of ALS. Autophagy plays an important role in degrading misfolded proteins, thereby preventing their aggregation. Pharmacological manipulation of autophagy has been proposed as a new therapeutic approach for treating ALS. IADB, a novel indole alkaloid derivative, has been reported to exert mitochondrial protection and cardioprotection through its autophagy-modulating potential. Our present study attempted to examine whether IADB has therapeutic potential in SOD1G93A-associated experimental models of ALS. We found that IADB could promote the clearance of SOD1G93A aggregates and reduce the overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells transfected with SOD1G93A. We further examined the IADB in a SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. Administration of IADB started at the age of 55 days until the end stage of the disease. IADB treatment significantly increased LC3-II levels and decreased human SOD1 levels and p62 expression in the spinal cords of SOD1G93A mice, suggesting that IADB treatment could induce autophagy activation and promote clearance of mutant SOD1 aggregates in this mouse model of ALS. Moreover, IADB treatment could alleviate the activation of microglia and astrocytes and reduce mitochondrial oxidative damage in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice. Finally, we demonstrated that IADB treatment could improve motor performance and delay the onset and progression of the disease in a mouse model of ALS. The neuroprotective effects of IADB may mainly originate from its autophagy-promoting property.",

    "abstract": "Brain functional network (BFN) analysis has become a popular technique for identifying neurological/mental diseases. Due to the fact that BFN is a graph, graph convolutional network (GCN) can be naturally used in the classification of BFN. Different from traditional methods that directly use the adjacency matrices of BFNs to train a classifier, GCN requires an additional input -- node features. To our best knowledge, however, there is no systematic study to analyze their influence on the performance of GCN-based brain disorder classification. Therefore, in this per, we conduct an empirical study on various node feature measures, including 1) original fMRI signals, 2) one-hot encoding, 3) node statistics, 4) node correlation, and 5) their combination. Experimental results on two benchmark databases show that different node feature inputs to GCN significantly affect the brain disease classification performance, and node correlation usually contributes higher accuracy compared to original signals and manually extracted statistical features.",

    "abstract": "Riluzole is the only treatment known to improve survival in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, oral riluzole efficacy is modest at best, further it is known to have large inter-individual variability of serum concentration and clearance, is formulated as an oral drug in a patient population plagued with dysphagia, and has known systemic side-effects like asthenia (limiting patient compliance) and elevated liver enzymes. In this context, we postulated that continuous intrathecal (IT) infusion of low doses of riluzole could provide consistent elevations of the drug spinal cord (SC) concentrations at or above those achieved with oral dosing, without increasing the risk for adverse events associated with systemic drug exposure or off-target side effects in the brain. We developed a formulation of riluzole for IT delivery and conducted our studies in purpose-bred hound dogs. Our non-GLP studies revealed that IT infusion alone was able to increase SC concentrations above those provided by oral administration, without increasing plasma concentrations. We then conducted two GLP studies that combined IT infusion with oral administration at human equivalent dose, to evaluate SC and brain concentrations of riluzole along with assessments of safety and tolerability. In the 6-week study, the highest IT dose (0.2 mg/hr) was well tolerated by the animals and increased SC concentrations above those achieved with oral riluzole alone, without increasing brain concentrations. In the 6-month study, the highest dose tested (0.4 mg/hr) was not tolerated and yielded SC significantly above those achieved in all previous studies. Our data show the feasibility and safety profile of continuous IT riluzole delivery to the spinal cord, without concurrent elevated liver enzymes, and minimal brain concentrations creating another potential therapeutic route of delivery to be used in isolation or in combination with other therapeutics.\"",

    "abstract": "Spaceflight has numerous untoward effects on human physiology. Various countermeasures are under investigation including artificial gravity (AG). Here, we investigated whether AG alters resting-state brain functional connectivity changes during head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR), a spaceflight analog. Participants underwent 60 days of HDBR. Two groups received daily AG administered either continuously (cAG) or intermittently (iAG). A control group received no AG. We assessed resting-state functional connectivity before, during, and after HDBR. We also measured balance and mobility changes from pre-to post-HDBR. We examined how functional connectivity changes throughout HDBR and whether AG is associated with differential effects. We found differential connectivity changes by group between posterior parietal cortex and multiple somatosensory regions. The control group exhibited increased functional connectivity between these regions throughout HDBR whereas the cAG group showed decreased functional connectivity. This finding suggests that AG alters somatosensory reweighting during HDBR. We also observed brain-behavioral correlations that differed significantly by group. Control group participants who showed increased connectivity between the putamen and somatosensory cortex exhibited greater mobility declines post-HDBR. For the cAG group, increased connectivity between these regions was associated with little to no mobility declines post-HDBR. This suggests that when somatosensory stimulation is provided via AG, functional connectivity increases between the putamen and somatosensory cortex are compensatory in nature, resulting in reduced mobility declines. Given these findings, AG may be an effective countermeasure for the reduced somatosensory stimulation that occurs in both microgravity and HDBR.",

However, no study so far has investigated the direct influence of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples on mPFC activity during spatial alternation learning. Long Evans rats were trained on a three-arm radial maze to perform a sequence of alternations. Three different alternation sequences needed to be learnt, and while learning a new sequence, the activity in the mPFC was inhibited either directly following sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus (on-time condition) or with a randomized delay (delayed condition). In the on-time condition the behavioral performance was significantly worse compared to the same animals in the delayed inhibition condition, as measured by a lower correct alternation performance and more perseverative behavior. This indicates that the activity in the mPFC directly following hippocampal sharp-wave ripples is necessary for spatial rule switching.",

    "abstract": "Certain ciliary transmembrane and membrane-tethered signaling proteins migrate from the ciliary tip to base via retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT), essential for maintaining their ciliary dynamics to enable cells to sense and transduce extracellular stimuli inside the cell. During this process, the BBSome functions as an adaptor between retrograde IFT trains and these signaling protein cargoes. The Arf-like 13 (ARL13) small GTPase resembles ARL6/BBS3 in facilitating these signaling cargoes to couple with the BBSome at the ciliary tip prior to loading onto retrograde IFT trains for transporting towards the ciliary base, while the molecular basis for how this intricate coupling event happens remains elusive. Here, we report that Chlamydomonas ARL13 only in a GTP-bound form (ARL13GTP) anchors to the membrane for diffusing into cilia. Upon entering cilia, ARL13 undergoes GTPase cycle for shuttling between the ciliary membrane (ARL13GTP) and matrix (ARL13GDP). To achieve this goal, the ciliary membrane-anchored BBS3GTP binds and activates the ciliary matrix-residing ARL13GDP as an ARL13 guanine nucleotide exchange factor. At the ciliary tip, ARL13GTP binds and recruits the ciliary matrix-residing and post-remodeled BBSome as an ARL13 effector to anchor to the ciliary membrane. This makes the BBSome spatiotemporally become available for the ciliary membrane-tethered phospholipase D (PLD) to couple with. Afterward, ARL13GTP hydrolyzes GTP for releasing the PLD-laden BBSome to load onto retrograde IFT trains. According to this model, hedgehog signaling defects associated with ARL13b and BBS3 mutations in humans could be satisfactorily explained, providing us a mechanistic understanding behind BBSome-cargo coupling required for proper ciliary signaling.\n\nSignificance statementCertain signaling proteins export in a BBSome-dependent manner from cilia via retrograde IFT. As IFT cargoes, their coupling with the BBSome is mediated by ARL13 and BBS3. Here, we report that ARL13 in a GTP-bound state binds the membrane for diffusing into cilia followed by running GTPase cycle with BBS3 acting as an ARL13-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. ARL13GTP recruits the IFT-shed BBSome as its effector to anchor to the membrane of the ciliary tip, making it spatiotemporally available for the ciliary membrane-tethered PLD to bind. Afterward, ARL13 GTP hydrolysis releases the PLD-laden BBSome for retrograde IFT train loading. ARL13 and BBS3 facilitate the cargo-BBSome coupling in such a way providing a regulatory mechanism for signaling protein export from cilia.",

However, a comprehensive multi-omic map of the developing secondary palate at single-cell resolution is lacking. In this study, we performed single-cell multiome sequencing and profiled chromatin accessibility and gene expression simultaneously within the same cells (n = 36,154) isolated from mouse secondary palate across embryonic days (E) 12.5, E13.5, E14.0, and E14.5. Application of optimal transport reconstructed five trajectories, representing continuous differentiation of multipotent cells into different subpopulations in later stages. By linking open chromatin signals to gene expression changes, we discovered a list of lineage-determining transcription factors, such as Shox2 for the anterior and Dlx1/2 for the posterior palatal mesenchymal trajectories.

    "abstract": "Genetic recombination is a key molecular mechanism that has profound implications on both micro- and macro-evolutionary processes. However, the determinants of recombination rate variation in holocentric organisms are poorly understood, in particular in Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). The wood white butterfly (Leptidea sinapis) shows considerable intraspecific variation in chromosome numbers and is a suitable system for studying regional recombination rate variation and its potential molecular underpinnings. Here, we developed a large wholegenome resequencing data set from a population of wood whites to obtain high-resolution recombination maps using linkage disequilibrium information. The analyses revealed that larger chromosomes had a bimodal recombination landscape, potentially due to interference between simultaneous chiasmata. The recombination rate was significantly lower in subtelomeric regions, with exceptions associated with segregating chromosome rearrangements, showing that fissions and fusions can have considerable effects on the recombination landscape. There was no association between the inferred recombination rate and base composition, supporting a negligible influence of GC-biased gene conversion in butterflies. We found significant but variable associations between the recombination rate and the density of different classes of transposable elements (TEs), most notably a significant enrichment of SINEs in genomic regions with higher recombination rate. Finally, the analyses unveiled significant enrichment of genes involved in farnesyltranstransferase activity in recombination cold-spots, potentially indicating that expression of transferases can inhibit formation of chiasmata during meiotic division. Our results provide novel information about recombination rate variation in holocentric organisms and has particular implications for forthcoming research in population genetics, molecular/genome evolution and speciation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCognitive dysfunction is a frequent stroke sequela but its pathogenesis and treatment remain unresolved. Involvement of aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis and maladaptive circuitry remodelling has been proposed but their mechanisms are unknown. Our aim was to evaluate potential underlying molecular/cellular events implicated.\n\nMethodsStroke was induced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in 2-month-old C57BL/6 male mice. Hippocampal metabolites/neurotransmitters were analysed longitudinally by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Cognitive function was evaluated with the contextual fear conditioning test. Microglia, astrocytes, neuroblasts and interneurons were analysed by immunofluorescence.\n\nResultsApproximately 50% of mice exhibited progressive post-MCAO cognitive impairment. Notably, immature hippocampal neurons in the impaired group displayed more severe aberrant phenotypes than those from the non-impaired group. Using MRS, significant bilateral changes in hippocampal metabolites such as myo-Inositol (mIns) or N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) were found that correlated, respectively, with numbers of glia and immature neuroblasts in the ischemic group. Importantly, some metabolites were specifically altered in the ipsilateral hippocampus suggesting its involvement in aberrant neurogenesis and remodelling processes. Specifically, MCAO animals with higher hippocampal GABA levels displayed worse cognitive outcome. Implication of GABA in this setting was supported by the amelioration of ischemia-induced memory deficits and aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis after blocking pharmacologically GABAergic neurotransmission. These data suggest that GABA exerts its detrimental effect, at least partly, by affecting morphology and integration of newborn neurons into the hippocampal circuits.\n\nConclusionsHippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission could be considered a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for post-stroke cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy has become an indispensable tool for revealing the dynamic regulations of cells and organelles in high resolution noninvasively. However, stochastic noise inherently restricts the upper bonds of optical interrogation quality and exacerbates the observation fidelity in encountering joint demand of high frame rate, long-term, and low photobleaching and phototoxicity. Here, we propose DeepSeMi, a self-supervised-learning-based denoising framework capable of increasing SNR by over 12 dB across various conditions. With the introduction of newly designed eccentric blind-spot convolution filters, DeepSeMi accomplished efficacious denoising requiring no clean data as references and no compromise of spatiotemporal resolution on diverse imaging systems. The computationally 15-fold multiplied photon budget in a standard confocal microscope by DeepSeMi allows for recording organelle interactions in four colors and high-frame-rate across tens of thousands of frames, monitoring migrasomes and retractosomes over a half day, and imaging ultra-phototoxicity-sensitive Dictyostelium cells over thousands of frames, all faithfully and sample-friendly. Through comprehensive validations across various cells and species over various instruments, we prove DeepSeMi is a versatile tool for reliably and bio-friendly breaking the shot-noise limit, facilitating automated analysis of massive data about cell migrations and organelle interactions.",

    "abstract": "Formate is a promising energy carrier that could be used to transport renewable electricity. Some acetogenic bacteria, such as Eubacterium limosum, have the native ability to utilise formate as a sole substrate for growth, which has sparked interest in the biotechnology industry. However, formatotrophic metabolism in acetogens is poorly understood, and a systems-level characterization in continuous cultures is yet to be reported. Here we present the first steady-state dataset for E. limosum formatotrophic growth. At a defined dilution rate of 0.4 d-1, there was a high specific uptake rate of formate (280{+/-}56 mmol/gDCW/d), however, most carbon went to CO2 (150{+/-}11 mmol/gDCW/d). Compared to methylotrophic growth, protein differential expression data and intracellular metabolomics revealed several key features of formate metabolism. Upregulation of pta appears to be a futile attempt of cells to produce acetate as the major product. Instead, a cellular energy limitation resulted in the accumulation of intracellular pyruvate and upregulation of Pfl to convert formate to pyruvate. Therefore, metabolism is controlled, at least partially, at the protein expression level, an unusual feature for an acetogen. We anticipate that formate could be an important one-carbon substrate for acetogens to produce chemicals rich in pyruvate, a metabolite generally in low abundance during syngas growth.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has gained increased popularity in recent years and has revolutionized the study of cell populations; however, this technology presents several caveats regarding specific gene expression measurement. Here we examine the expression levels of several immune checkpoint genes, which are currently assessed in clinical studies. We find that unlike in most bulk sequencing studies, PVRIG, a novel immune-modulatory receptor in the DNAM-1 axis, suffers from poor detection in 10x Chromium scRNA-seq and other types of assays that utilize the GENCODE transcriptomic reference (gene model). We show that the default GENCODE gene model, typically used in the analysis of such data, is incorrect in the PVRIG genomic region and demonstrate that fixing the gene model recovers genuine PVRIG expression levels. We explore computational strategies for resolving multi-gene mapped reads, such as those implemented in RSEM and STARsolo and find that they provide a partial solution to the problem. Our study provides means to better interrogate the expression of PVRIG in scRNA-seq and emphasizes the importance of optimizing gene models and alignment algorithms to enable accurate gene expression measurement in scRNA-seq and bulk sequencing. The methodology applied here for PVRIG can be applied to other genes with similar issues.",

    "abstract": "Beta diversity, which quantifies the compositional variation among communities, is one of the fundamental partitions of biodiversity and is associated with abiotic and biotic drivers. Unveiling these drivers is essential for understanding various ecological processes in past and recent faunal communities. Although the quantification of measures of beta diversity has improved over the years, the potential dependence of beta diversity on methodological choices are relatively understudied. Here, we investigate the effect of the variable scale of sampling on different measures of beta diversity at a regional scale. The west coast of India bordering the eastern margin of the Arabian sea, presents a coastal stretch of approximately 6100km from 8-21{degrees}N. We used marine bivalve distribution data, consisting of live occurrence data from literature reports and abundance data from death assemblages collected from localities representing latitude bins. We tested if the observed variation in beta diversity is explained by variable sampling scales due to differences in bin sizes and unequal coastline length. We developed a null model to generate a beta diversity pattern with an increase in spatial scale of sampling by increasing the spatial grain size along the 14 latitude bins progressively. Our null model demonstrates that for the both live and dead dataset, the total beta diversity measured by Bray-Curtis, Whittaker and Sorenson indices decreases with increasing sampling scale. The species replacement (turnover) evaluated by Simpson index decreases and the species loss (nestedness) measured by Sorenson index increases with increasing sampling scale. A comparison between the simulated and observed beta diversity distribution using K-S test demonstrated that the observed pattern of beta diversity is significantly different from the pattern generated from the null model in both live and death assemblages. This implies that sampling alone does not generate the spatial variation in beta diversity in this region. The results show that environmental parameters such as salinity, productivity, and cyclones play a significant role in shaping the regional beta diversity along the west coast. Our study provides an approach for evaluating the effect of variable sampling scale on comparing regional beta diversity. It also highlights the importance of spatial standardization while inferring about processes driving spatial diversity changes.",

    "abstract": "Qionggui Power (QP), a classic prescription in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has shown potential in the treatment of atherosclerosis during the past decades. However, the mechanism that mediates these cardiovascular benefits remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of QP against atherosclerosis with network pharmacology approaches and in vitro model. The active ingredients and related targets of QP were collected from public databases. The hub targets and signaling pathways of QP against AS were defined by extensive application of bioinformatics approaches, including the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The predicted major targets were validated in LPS-stimulated murine macrophages RAW264.7. The anti-inflammatory properties of QP were also evaluated in this model. In silico investigation of QP resulted in the identification of 18 active ingredients and 49 chemical targets intersecting with AS-related genes. And KEGG pathway analysis revealed a high enrichment in the Lipid and Atherosclerosis pathway of these chemical targets. Biochemical analysis showed marked effects of QP on the expression of predicted chemical targets (PPARr, CAT, PTGS2) and LPS-induced inflammatory genes (IL1, IL6, and TNF). And these inhibitory effects were linked to the suppression of the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway, which was activated by the LPS stimulus. Our findings revealed the therapeutic potential of QP in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "When covered by a layer of soil, seedling development follows a dark-specific program (skoto-morphogenesis) consisting of small, non-green cotyledons, a long hypocotyl and an apical hook to protect meristematic cells. We recently highlighted the role played by mitochondria in the high energy-consuming reprogramming of Arabidopsis skoto-morphogenesis. Here, the role played by plastids, another energy supplying organelle, in skoto-morphogenesis is investigated. This study was conducted in dark conditions to exclude light signals so as to better focus on those produced by plastids. It was found that limitation of plastid gene-expression (PGE) induced an exaggerated apical hook bending. Inhibition of PGE was obtained at the level of transcription and translation using the antibiotics rifampicin and spectinomycin, respectively, as well as plastid RPOTP RNA polymerase mutants. Rifampicin-treated seedlings also showed expression induction of marker nuclear genes for mitochondrial stress, perturbation of the mitochondrial metabolism, increase of ROS levels and an augmented capacity of oxygen consumption by mitochondrial alternative oxidases (AOX). AOX enzymes act to prevent over-reduction of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Previously, we reported that AOX1A, the main AOX isoform, was a key component in the developmental response to mitochondrial respiration deficiency. In this work, we suggest the involvement of AOX1A in the response to PGE dysfunction and propose the importance of signalling between plastids and mitochondria. Finally, it was found that seedling architecture reprogramming in response to rifampicin was independent of canonical organelle retrograde pathways and the ethylene signaling pathway.\n\nSignificance statementIn underground germination conditions, seedling development follows a dark-specific program (skoto-morphogenesis) consisting of small and non-green cotyledons, a long hypocotyl and an apical hook to protect meristematic cells. We show that skoto-morphogenesis is reprogrammed when plastid gene expression is perturbed leading to an exaggeration of apical hook bending. We propose the involvement of the cooperation between plastids and mitochondria, the energy-supplying organelles of the cell.",

Here we performed a gain of function screen for proteins that could silence a target gene when fused to an artificial zinc finger. We uncovered many proteins that suppressed gene expression either through the establishment of DNA methylation, or via DNA methylation-independent processes including histone H3K27me3 deposition, H3K4me3 demethylation, H3K9, H3K14, H3K27, and H4K16 deacetylation, inhibition of RNA Polymerase II transcription elongation or Ser-5 dephosphorylation. The silencing fusion proteins also silenced many other genes with different efficacy, and a machine learning model could accurately predict the efficacy of each silencer based on various chromatin features of the target loci. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of epigenetic regulatory pathways and provide an armament of tools for targeted manipulation of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Engineering the utilization of non-native substrates, or synthetic heterotrophy, in proven industrial microbes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae represents an opportunity to valorize plentiful and renewable sources of carbon and energy as potential inputs to biotechnological processes. We previously demonstrated that activation of the galactose (GAL) regulon, a regulatory structure used by this yeast to coordinate substrate utilization with biomass formation during growth on galactose, during growth on the non-native substrate xylose results in a vastly altered gene expression profile and faster growth compared with constitutive overexpression of the same heterologous catabolic pathway. However, this effort involved the creation of a xylose-inducible variant of Gal3p (Gal3pS25144.1), the sensor protein of the GAL regulon, preventing this semi-synthetic regulon approach from being easily adapted to additional non-native substrates. Here, we report the construction of a variant Gal3pMC (metabolic coordinator) that exhibits robust GAL regulon activation in the presence of structurally diverse substrates and recapitulates the dynamics of the native system. Multiple molecular modeling studies confirm that Gal3pMC occupies conformational states corresponding to galactose-bound Gal3p in an inducer-independent manner. Using Gal3pMC to test a regulon approach to the assimilation of the non-native lignocellulosic sugars xylose, arabinose, and cellobiose yields higher growth rates and final cell densities when compared with a constitutive overexpression of the same set of catabolic genes. The subsequent demonstration of rapid and complete co-utilization of all three non-native substrates suggests that Gal3pMC-mediated dynamic global gene expression changes by GAL regulon activation may be universally beneficial for engineering synthetic heterotrophy.",

    "abstract": "Various laboratory-developed metabolomic methods lead to big challenges in inter-laboratory comparability and effective integration of diverse datasets. As part of the Quartet Project, we established a publicly available suite of four metabolite reference materials derived from B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from a family quartet of parents and monozygotic twin daughters. We generated comprehensive LC-MS based metabolomic data from the Quartet reference materials using targeted and untargeted strategies in different laboratories. High variabilities in the qualitative and quantitative metabolomic measurements were observed across laboratories. Moreover, the Quartet multi-sample-based quality metrics were developed for objectively assessing the reliability of metabolomic profiling in detecting intrinsic biological differences among difference groups of samples. Importantly, the ratio-based metabolomic profiling, by scaling the absolute values of a study sample relative to those of a universal reference sample, enables data integration in long-term measurements across difference laboratories or platforms. Thus, we constructed the ratio-based high-confidence reference datasets between two reference samples, providing \"ground truth\" for inter-laboratory proficiency test, which enables objective assessment of various metabolomic methods. Our study provided the community with rich resources and best practice for objective assessment of inter-laboratory measurements and data integration, ensuring reliable large-scale and longitudinal metabolomic profiling.",

Here we describe the sponges (phylum Porifera) from the Carmel Pinnacles State Marine Reserve, as assessed by a SCUBA-based survey in shallow waters. Of the 29 sponge species documented, 12 (41%) of them were previously unknown. Using a combination of underwater photography, DNA sequencing, and morphological taxonomy, we greatly improve our understanding of the status and distribution of previously described species and formally describe the new species as Hymedesmia promina sp. nov., Phorbas nebulosus sp. nov., Clathria unoriginalis sp. nov., Clathria rumsena sp. nov., Megaciella sanctuarium sp. nov., Mycale lobos sp. nov., Xestospongia ursa sp. nov., Haliclona melissae sp. nov., Halichondria loma sp. nov., Hymeniacidon fusiformis sp. nov., Scopalina carmela sp. nov., and Obruta collector gen. nov., sp. nov. An additional species, Lissodendoryx topsenti (de Laubenfels 1930), is moved to Hemimycale, and H. polyboletus comb. nov., nom. nov. is created due to preoccupation by H. topsenti (Burton, 1929). Several of the new species appear to be rare and/or have very restricted distributions, as they were not found at comparative survey sites outside of Carmel Bay. These results illustrate the potential of qualitative presence/absence systematic surveys of understudied taxa to discover and document substantial novel diversity.",

The cellular heterogeneity of the airway wall has only recently been recognized by single-cell analyses. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing of primary human bronchial epithelial cells growing in air-liquid interface to determine cell-specific changes evoked by flagellin, a protein driving the motility of many mucosal pathogens. We detected seven cell clusters in the human epithelium, including ciliated cells, ionocytes and several states of basal and secretory cells, of which only inflammatory basal cells and inflammatory secretory cells showed a proportional increase in response to flagellin. Only inflammatory secretory cells showed evidence of metabolic reprogramming toward aerobic glycolysis, and inhibition of the mTOR pathway specifically reduced this subset, prevented this metabolic shift, and reduced inflammatory gene transcription in these cells. This study expands our knowledge of the airways immune response to flagellated pathogens to single cell resolution and defines a novel target to modulate mucosal immunity during bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "The Ikaros zinc finger transcription factor Eos has been commonly implicated in regulatory T cells to promote their immunosuppressive functions. Paradoxically, a new role is emerging for Eos in promoting pro-inflammatory responses of conventional CD4+ T cells in the dysregulated setting of autoimmunity. Even so, the precise role of Eos in regulating the differentiation and function of healthy effector CD4+ T cell subsets remains unclear. Here, we find that Eos is a positive regulator of CD4+ T helper 2 (TH2) cells--effector T cells implicated in the induction of allergic asthma. Using murine in vitro TH2 cells and an in vivo house dust mite asthma model, we found that Eos-deficient T cells had reduced expression of key TH2 transcription factors, effector cytokines, and differentiation receptors. Mechanistically, among various TH2-polarizing pathways, the IL-2/STAT5 axis and its downstream TH2 gene targets emerged as one of the most significantly downregulated networks in Eos deficiency. Using in vitro TH2 cells and overexpression of Eos zinc-finger-domain mutants, we discovered that Eos forms a novel complex with and supports the tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling activity of STAT5. Overall, these data define a novel regulatory mechanism whereby Eos promotes IL-2/STAT5 activity to facilitate TH2 differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Adhesins (adhesive proteins) help bacteria stick to and colonize diverse surfaces and often contribute to virulence. The genome of the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) encodes dozens of putative adhesins, some of which are upregulated during plant pathogenesis. Little is known about the role of these proteins in bacterial wilt disease. During tomato colonization, three putative Rs adhesin genes were upregulated in a {Delta}phcA quorum sensing mutant that cannot respond to high cell densities: radA (Ralstonia adhesin), rcpA (Ralstonia collagen-like protein), and rcpB. Based on this differential gene expression, we hypothesized that adhesins repressed by PhcA contribute to early disease stages when Rs experiences a low cell density. During root colonization Rs upregulated rcpA and rcpB, but not radA, relative to bacteria in the stem at mid-disease. Root attachment assays and confocal microscopy with {Delta}rcpA/B and {Delta}radA revealed that all three adhesins help Rs attach to tomato seedling roots. Biofilm assays on abiotic surfaces found that Rs does not require RadA, RcpA, or RcpB for interbacterial attachment (cohesion), but these proteins are essential for anchoring aggregates to a surface (adhesion). However, Rs did not require the adhesins for later disease stages in planta, including colonization of the root endosphere and stems. Interestingly, all three adhesins were essential for full competitive fitness in planta. Together, these infection stage-specific assays identified three proteins that contribute to adhesion and the critical first host-pathogen interaction in bacterial wilt disease.\n\nImportanceEvery microbe must balance its need to attach to surfaces with the biological imperative to move and spread. The high-impact plant pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum can stick to biotic and abiotic substrates, presumably using some of the dozens of putative adhesins encoded in its genome. We confirmed the functions and identified the biological roles of several afimbrial adhesins. By assaying the competitive fitness and the success of adhesin mutants in three individual plant compartments, we identified the specific disease stages and host tissues where three previously cryptic adhesins contribute to bacterial success. Combined with tissue-specific regulatory data, this work indicates that R. solanacearum deploys distinct adhesins that help it succeed at different stages of plant pathogenesis.\n\nResearch AreasPlant Microbiology, Host-Microbial Interactions, Microbial Pathogenesis",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCandida albicans is a commensal yeast that may cause life-threatening infections. Studies have shown that the cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 7 gene (QCR7) of C. albicans encodes a protein that forms a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III, making it an important target for studying the virulence of this yeast. However, to the best of our knowledge, the functions of QCR7 have not yet been characterized.\n\nMethodsA QCR7 knockout strain was constructed using SN152, and BALb/c mice were used as model animals to determine the role of QCR7 in the virulence of C. albicans. Subsequently, the effects of QCR7 on mitochondrial functions and use of carbon sources were investigated. Next, its mutant biofilm formation and hyphal growth maintenance were compared with those of the wild type. Furthermore, the transcriptome of the qcr7{Delta}/{Delta} mutant was compared with that of the WT strain to explore pathogenic mechanisms.\n\nResultsDefective QCR7 attenuated the virulence of C. albicans infection in vivo. Furthermore, the mutant influenced the use of multiple alternative carbon sources that exist in several host niches. Moreover, it led to mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the QCR7 knockout strain showed defects in biofilm formation or the maintenance of filamentous growth. The overexpression of cell-surface-associated genes (HWP1, YWP1, XOG1, and SAP6) can restore defective virulence phenotypes and the carbon-source utilization of qcr7{Delta}/{Delta}.\n\nConclusionThis study provides new insights into the mitochondria-based metabolism of C. albicans, accounting for its virulence and the use of variable carbon sources that promote C. albicans to colonize host niches.",

    "abstract": "Phage-plasmids are extra-chromosomal elements that act both as plasmids and as phages, whose eco-evolutionary dynamics remain poorly constrained. Here, we show segregational drift and loss- of-function mutations play key roles in the infection dynamics of a cosmopolitan phage-plasmid, allowing it to create continuous productive infections in a population of marine Roseobacter. Recurrent loss-of-function mutations in the phage repressor that controls prophage induction led to constitutively lytic phage-plasmids that spread rapidly throughout the population. The entire phage-plasmid genome was packaged into virions, which were horizontally transferred by re-infecting lysogenized cells, leading to an increase in phage-plasmid copy number and to a heterozygous phage repressor locus within re-infected cells. While wild-type repressor variants prevented induction of phage-plasmids in a cell, the uneven apportionment of phage-plasmids after cell division (i.e., segregational drift) led to the production of offspring carrying only the constitutively lytic phage-plasmid, thus restarting the lysis-reinfection-segregation life-cycle. Mathematical models and experiments showed that these dynamics lead to a continuous productive infection of the bacterial population in which lytic and lysogenic phage-plasmids coexist. An analysis of marine bacterial genomes shows that the same plasmid backbone here described carries different phages in the environment and disseminates trans-continentally, suggesting that the phage-plasmid strategy is relevant and widespread in nature. Together, our study describes how the interplay between phage infection and plasmid genetics provide a unique eco-evolutionary strategy for phage-plasmids.",

    "abstract": "Management of widespread plant pathogens is challenging as climatic differences among crop growing regions may alter key aspects of pathogen spread and disease severity. Xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterial pathogen that is transmitted by xylem sap feeding insects. Geographic distribution of X. fastidiosa is limited by winter climate and vines infected with X. fastidiosa can recover from infection when held at cold temperatures. California has a long history of research on Pierces disease, and significant geographic and climatic diversity among grape-growing regions. This background in combination with experimental disease studies under controlled temperature conditions can inform risk assessment for X. fastidiosa spread and epidemic severity across different regions and under changing climate conditions. Californias grape growing regions have considerable differences in summer and winter climate. In northern and coastal regions, summers are mild and winters cool, conditions favoring winter recovery of infected vines. In contrast, in inland and southern areas summers are hot and winters mild, reducing likelihood of winter recovery. Here, winter recovery of three table grape cultivars (Flame, Scarlet Royal, and Thompson seedless) and three wine grape cultivars (Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Zinfandel) were evaluated under temperature conditions representative of the San Joaquin Valley, an area with hot summers and mild winters that has been severely impacted by Pierces disease, and contains a large portion of California grape production. Mechanically inoculated vines were held in the greenhouse under one of three warming treatments to represent different seasonal inoculation dates prior to being moved into a cold chamber. Winter recovery under all treatments was generally limited, but with some cultivar variation. Given hot summer temperatures of many grape-growing regions worldwide, as well as increasing global temperatures overall, winter recovery of grapevines should not be considered a key factor affecting X. fastidiosa spread and epidemic severity in the majority of cases.",

We have recently shown that POGZ maintains mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a chromatin regulator and a transcription factor. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that POGZ plays important role in the maintenance of ESCs by silencing the Dux gene and certain endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). POGZ directly binds to the Dux gene and ERVs, and its depletion leads to up-regulation of 2C genes and the repetitive elements such as RLTR9E and IAP (the intracisternal A-type particles), resulting in transition to a 2C-like (2CLC) state and genome instability. POGZ regulates ESC heterochromatin state by association and recruiting TRIM28 and SETDB1, and its loss leads to increased H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and decreased H3K9me3 at local chromatin. Activation of POGZ-bound ERVs is associated with up-regulation of nearby neural genes. Chimeric transcripts that are initiated within ERVs and spliced to genic exons are highly expressed in Pogz-/- ESCs. Our findings establish that POGZ is required for the maintenance of ESCs by repressing Dux and silencing ERVs, which may provide important insights into the disease pathology caused by POGZ dysfunction.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPOGZ depletion leads to activation of 2C genes\nC_LIO_LIPOGZ depletion leads to deregulation of ERVs\nC_LIO_LIPOGZ directly binds and represses Dux\nC_LIO_LIPOGZ associates with TRIM28/SETDB1 to maintain heterochromatin state to silence ERVs\nC_LIO_LIActivation of POGZ-bound ERVs is associated with up-regulation of nearby neural genes\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Regulation by the small modifier SUMO is heavily dependent on spatial control of enzymes that mediate the attachment and removal of SUMO on substrate proteins. Here we show that in fission yeast, delocalisation of the SUMO protease Ulp1 from the nuclear envelope results in centromeric defects that can be attributed to hyper-SUMOylation at the nuclear periphery. Unexpectedly, we find that while this localised hyper-SUMOylation impairs centromeric silencing, it can also enhance centromere clustering. Moreover, both effects are at least partially dependent on SUMOylation of the inner nuclear membrane protein Lem2. Lem2 has previously been implicated in diverse biological processes, including the promotion of both centromere clustering and silencing, but how these distinct activities are coordinated was unclear; our observations suggest a model whereby SUMOylation may serve as a regulatory switch, modulating Lem2 interactions with competing partner proteins to balance its roles in alternative pathways. Our findings also reveal a previously unappreciated role for SUMOylation in promoting centromere clustering.",

    "abstract": "A functional network of blood vessels is essential for organ growth and homeostasis. Yet, how the vasculature matures and maintains adult homeostasis remains elusive in live mice. By longitudinally tracking the same neonatal endothelial cells (ECs) over days to weeks, we found that capillary plexus expansion is driven by network-wide vessel regression and transient angiogenesis. A fixed number of neonatal ECs rearrange their positions to evenly distribute throughout the developing plexus and become positionally stable in adulthood. Upon injury, while neonatal ECs are predisposed to die, adult ECs survive through a plasmalemmal self-repair response. Furthermore, adult neighboring ECs reactivate migration to assist vessel repair. Lastly, neonatal vessel regression and adult vascular maintenance are orchestrated by temporally restricted VEGFR2 dependent signaling. Our work sheds light on fundamental cellular mechanisms that underlie both vascular maturation and adult homeostasis in vivo.",

    "abstract": "In the face of rapid global change and an uncertain fate for biodiversity, it is vital to quantify trends in wild populations. These trends are typically estimated from abundance time series for suites of species across large geographic and temporal scales. Such data implicitly contain phylogenetic, spatial, and temporal structure which, if not properly accounted for, may obscure the true magnitude and direction of biodiversity change. Here, using a novel statistical framework to simultaneously account for all three of these structures, we show that the majority of current abundance trends estimates among 10 high-profile datasets, representing millions of abundance observations, are likely unreliable or incorrect. Our new approach suggests that previous models are too simplistic, incorrectly estimating global abundance trends and often dramatically underestimating uncertainty, an aspect that is critical when translating global assessments into policy outcomes. Further, our approach also results in substantial improvements in abundance forecasting accuracy. Whilst our results do not improve the outlook for biodiversity, our framework does allow us to make more robust estimates of global wildlife abundance trends, which is critical for developing policy to protect our biosphere.",

Moreover, it has been discovered that pheromone analogs can disturb or inhibit mating communication in some species of moths. Ectropis grisescens Warren (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), is the most severe tea defoliator in China. Thus, in our study, an analog of the pest sex pheromone component, (Z, Z, Z)-3,6,9-nonadecadiene (Z3Z6Z9-19:Hy), was selected to determine its potential activity in controlling the pest. Electroantennogram (EAG), Y-tube olfactometer, and wind tunnel experiments separately showed potential inhibition of Z3Z6Z9-19:Hy. The response elicited by Z3Z6Z9-19:Hy displayed a dose-dependent way in EAG test. Furthermore, in Y-tube olfactometer, percentage of positive response of E. grisescens males was significantly (P<0.01) reduced by Z3Z6Z9-19:Hy up to 70%. In wind tunnel, all types of behavioral response were significantly (P<0.01) inhibited by Z3Z6Z9-19:Hy, percentage of contacting source was utterly inhibited at the lowest dose tested. Based on these results, the combination of the analog and SNMP1 protein was also studied. Our study revealed the potential of Z3Z6Z9-19:Hy as a sex pheromone inhibitor, which would provide new perspectives in monitoring and mating disruption of E. grisescens in pest-control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Coevolution of competitors can lead to niche partitioning promoting coexistence or to heightened conflicts promoting competitive exclusion. If both are possible, when should coevolution favor coexistence versus exclusion? We investigated this question with a general eco-evolutionary model in which species can reduce the interspecific competition they experience through evolutionary investments in two types of competitive traits: partitioning traits that promote coexistence and conflict traits that promote exclusion. We found that communities were generally mixed, consisting of species investing in both trait types or mixtures of species specializing in one type. For each species, its competitors abundances and investments determined its experienced competition, and stronger competition begot greater competitive trait investment. Species investing in conflict traits strengthened competition for other species both directly and indirectly, whereas partitioning traits only weakened competition via direct effects. Conflict traits were therefore the stronger driver of community-wide investments in all traits. However, species investing most in conflict traits experienced less competition, so they ultimately evolved least investment, making them most likely to be excluded by the next invader. Thus, coevolution may provide an open door for species that play nice and a revolving door of exclusion for those that do not.",

Often, interest is in obtaining the averages of these measures across all possible selection gradients, but explicit formulae for most of these average measures have not been known. Previous authors relied either on approximations by the delta method, whose accuracy is generally unknown, or Monte Carlo evaluations (including the random skewers analysis), which necessarily involve random fluctuations. This study presents new, exact expressions for the average conditional evolvability, average autonomy, average respondability, average flexibility, average response difference, and average response correlation, utilizing their mathematical structures as ratios of quadratic forms. The new expressions are infinite series involving top-order zonal and invariant polynomials of matrix arguments, and can be numerically evaluated as their partial sums with, for some measures, known error bounds. Whenever these partial sums numerically converge within reasonable computational time and memory, they will replace the previous approximate methods. In addition, new expressions are derived for the average measures under a general normal distribution for the selection gradient, extending the applicability of these measures into a substantially broader class of selection regimes.",

In a recent analysis, duplicate gene copies that had evolved higher expression in liver following the salmonid WGD ~100 million years ago were associated with higher numbers of predicted TE-derived cis-regulatory elements (TE-CREs). Yet, the ability of these TE-CREs to recruit transcription factors (TFs) in vivo and impact gene expression remains unknown.\n\nResultsHere, we evaluated the gene regulatory functions of 11 TEs using luciferase promoter reporter assays in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) primary liver cells. Canonical Tc1-Mariner elements from intronic regions showed no or small repressive effects on transcription. However, other TE-derived cis-regulatory elements upstream of transcriptional start sites increased expression significantly.\n\nConclusionOur results question the hypothesis that TEs in the Tc1-Mariner superfamily, which were extremely active following WGD in salmonids, had a major impact on regulatory rewiring of gene duplicates, but highlights the potential of other TEs in post-WGD rewiring of gene regulation in the Atlantic salmon genome.",

    "abstract": "Transitions from sexual to asexual reproduction have occurred in numerous lineages across the tree of life, but it remains unclear why asexual populations rarely persist. In facultatively parthenogenetic animals, all-female populations can arise when males are absent or become extinct, and such populations can give rise to obligately asexual species. Facultative parthenogens could therefore shed light on the initial stages of transitions to asexuality, and the factors that determine the success or failure of asexual populations. Here, we describe a novel spatial mosaic of mixed-sex and all-female populations of the facultatively parthenogenetic Australian phasmid Megacrania batesii, and use this system to investigate the consequences of reproductive mode variation in the wild. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicated multiple, independent transitions between reproductive modes. As expected, all-female populations had drastically reduced heterozygosity and genetic diversity relative to mixed-sex populations. However, we found few consistent differences in fitness-related traits between population types. All-female populations exhibited more frequent and severe (non-functional) wing deformities, but did not show higher rates of appendage loss. All-female populations also harbored more parasites, but only in certain habitats. Reproductive mode explained little variation in female body size, fecundity, or egg hatch-rate. Our results confirm that transitions to parthenogenetic reproduction can lead to dramatic reductions in genetic diversity and heterozygosity. However, our findings also suggest that asexual M. batesii populations consist of high-fitness genotypes that might be able to thrive for many generations, perhaps until they encounter a drastic environmental change to which they are unable to adapt.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between mutations (epistasis) can add substantial complexity to genotype-phenotype maps, hampering our ability to predict evolution. Yet, recent studies have shown that the fitness effect of a mutation can often be predicted from the fitness of its genetic background using simple, linear relationships. This phenomenon, termed global epistasis, has been leveraged to reconstruct fitness landscapes and infer adaptive trajectories in a wide variety of contexts. However, little attention has been paid to how patterns of global epistasis may be affected by environmental variation -- both from external sources or induced by the population itself through eco-evolutionary feedbacks -- despite this variation frequently being a major driver of evolution. By analyzing a four-mutation fitness landscape, here we show that patterns of global epistasis can be strongly modulated by the concentration of a drug in the environment. Using previous theoretical results, we demonstrate that this modulation can be explained by how specific gene-by-gene interactions are modified by drug dose. Importantly, our results highlight the need to incorporate potential environmental variation into the global epistasis framework in order to predict adaptation in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the leading cause of death among individuals over 65. Despite many AD genetic variants detected by large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) a limited number of causal genes have been confirmed. Conventional machine learning techniques integrate functional annotation data and GWAS signals to assign variants functional relevance probabilities. Yet, a large proportion of genetic variation lies in the non-coding genome, where unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques have demonstrated a greater advantage. Furthermore, cell-type specific approaches are needed to better understand disease etiology. Studying AD from a microglia-specific lens is more likely to reveal causal variants involved in immune pathways. Therefore, in this study, we developed a semi-supervised ensemble approach using microglia-specific data to prioritize non-coding variants and their target genes that play roles in immune-related AD mechanisms. We designed a transductive positive-unlabeled and negative-unlabeled learning model that employs a bagging technique to learn from unlabeled variants, generating multiple predicted probabilities of variant risk. Using a combined homogeneous-heterogeneous ensemble framework, we aggregated the predictions. We applied our model to AD variant data, identifying 11 risk variants acting in well-known AD genes, such as TSPAN14, INPP5D, and MS4A2. These results validated our models performance and demonstrated a need to study these genes in the context of microglial pathways. We also proposed further experimental study for 37 potential causal variants associated with less-known genes. Our work has utility in predicting AD relevant genes and variants functioning in microglia and can be generalized for application to other complex diseases.",

We then constructed neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees of the INK4 and p53 protein families and analyzed sequence conservation using sequence logos of the rBH3 locus. This showed the rBH3 motif is conserved throughout jawed vertebrates p63 and p73 sequences and in chondrichthyans, amphibians, mammals, and some reptiles in p18. Finally, a potential rBH3 motif was identified in mammalian and osteichthyan p19INK4d (p19, cyclin dependent kinase 4 inhibitor d).

Circumventing the challenges stemming from such undesirable non-degradability on disposal, here we present an eco-friendly, robust, yet inexpensive and equipment-free method of growing biodegradable PPE fabrics by the fermentation of locally-sourced organic feed stocks in a rural livelihood. Using a pre-acclimatized symbiotic culture, we report the production of a high yield (up to 3.2 g fabric/g substrate) of bacterial cellulose, a biopolymer matrix, obtained by bacterial weaving. This membrane has an intricate, self-assembled, nano-porous 3D architecture formed by randomly oriented cellulose fibres. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the pore size of the membrane turns out to be in the tune of 140 nanometers on the average, indicating that it can filter out viruses effectively. In-vitro results demonstrate assured breathability through the membrane for a filter thickness of approximately 5 microns. When subjected to soil degradation, the fabrics are seen to disintegrate rapidly and fully decompose within 15 days. With a favourable cost proposition of less than 1 US$ per meter square of the developed fabric unit, our approach stands out in providing a unique sustainable, and production-ready alternative to synthetic PPE fabrics, solving community healthcare and environmental crisis, and opening up new avenues sustainable under-served livelihood at the same time.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=90 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/514716v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bfa2forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5649a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fc99a4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cae297_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Also, little is known about the performance of UAV-based image texture features in crop nitrogen and NUE monitoring. In this study, eight flying missions were carried out throughout different stages of winter wheat (from the jointing stage to the stage 25 days after flowering) to acquire multispectral images. Forty-three multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and forty texture features (TFs) were calculated from images and fed into the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) regression models for predicting nitrogen-related indicators. Our main purposes were to (1) evaluate the potential of UAV-based images to predict NC in different organs of winter wheat and nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE); (2) compare the performances of VIs, TFs and the combination of them for nitrogen monitoring. The results showed that the correlation between different features (VIs and TFs) and NC in different organs varied between the vegetative and reproductive phases. Most of VIs were found to be positively correlated with NC, while most of the TFs were negatively correlated with NC. PLSR latent variables extracted from VIs and TFs explained 80% of the variations in NAE. However, no significant differences were found between VIs and TFs in their performance in predicting NC in different organs. This study demonstrated the promise of applying UAV-based imaging to estimate NC and NAE in different organs of winter wheat.",

Compared with conventional anticoagulant or thrombolytic drugs, sonothrombolysis has the potential to remarkably shorten the required treatment time owing to the direct clot targeting with acoustic waves. However, previously reported strategies for sonothrombolysis have not demonstrated clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g., recanalization within 30 minutes) in treating large, completely occluded veins or arteries. In this paper, we demonstrated a new vortex ultrasound technique for endovascular sonothrombolysis utilizing wave-matter interaction-induced shear stress to enhance the lytic rate substantially. Our in vitro experiment showed that the lytic rate was increased by at least 64.3 % compared with the nonvortex endovascular ultrasound treatment. A 3.1 g, 7.5 cm long, completely occluded in vitro 3D model of acute CVST was fully recanalized within 8 minutes with a record-high lytic rate of 237.5 mg/min for acute bovine clot in vitro. Furthermore, we confirmed that the vortex ultrasound causes no vessel wall damage over ex vivo bovine veins. This vortex ultrasound thrombolysis technique potentially presents a new life-saving tool for severe CVST cases that cannot be efficaciously treated using existing therapies.",

    "abstract": "Epicardial delivery of human follistatin-like 1 protein (FSTL1) induces significant cardiac benefit following a myocardial infarction (MI). However, the optimal dosing regimen for maximal therapeutic benefit has not yet been elucidated. To investigate the impact of multiple FSTL1 doses, without the confounding effects of multiple surgical procedures for multidose delivery, alternative delivery strategies are needed. Here, we use an epicardial reservoir that allows non-invasive delivery of additional doses after implantation to investigate the impact of single, double, and triple FSTL1 dose regimens in a rat model of MI. Multidose delivery of FSTL1 improves ejection fraction (3 doses), fractional shortening (1, 2 and 3 doses), and chamber stiffness (2 doses) 28 days after MI. Histologically, multiple FSTL1 doses increase ventricular wall thickness (2 and 3 doses) and reduce infarct size (1, 2, and 3 doses). We also demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in blood vessel number and density in the infarct zone, with three FSTL1 doses leading to the highest improvements. This study shows that multidose delivery of FSTL1 improves cardiac function, healing, and angiogenesis following MI. The epicardial delivery platform used here may be essential in optimizing dosing regimens of various bioagent combinations for a range of clinical indications.",

    "abstract": "The movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) is a low-frequency component of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal recorded from the motor cortex and its neighboring cortical areas. Since the MRCP encodes motor intention and execution, it may be utilized as an interface between patients and neurorehabilitation technologies. This study investigates the EEG signal recorded from the Cz electrode to discriminate between four levels of rate of force development (RFD) of the tibialis anterior muscle. For classification, three feature sets were evaluated to describe the EEG traces. These were (i) MRCP morphological characteristics in the{delta} -band such as amplitude and timing, (ii) MRCP statistical characteristics in the{delta} -band such as mean, standard deviation, and kurtosis, and (iii) wideband time-frequency features in the 0.5-90 Hz range. Using a support vector machine for classification, the four levels of RFD were classified with a mean (SD) accuracy of 82% (7%) accuracy when using the time-frequency feature space, and with an accuracy of 75% (12%) when using the MRCP statistical characteristics. It was also observed that some of the key features from the statistical and morphological sets responded monotonically to the intensity of the RFD. Examples are slope and standard deviation in the (0, 1)s window for the statistical, and min1 and minn for the morphological sets. This monotonical response of features explains the observed performance of the{delta} -band MRCP and corresponding high discriminative power. Results from temporal analysis considering the pre-movement phase ((-3, 0)s) and three windows of the post-movement phase ((0, 1)s, (1, 2)s, and (2, 3)s)) suggest that the complete MRCP waveform represents high information content regarding the planning, execution, duration, and ending of the isometric dorsiflexion task using the tibialis anterior muscle. Results shed light on the role of{delta} -band in translating to motor command, with potential applications in neural engineering systems.",

    "abstract": "Supervised machine learning (SML) is an approach that learns from training data with known category membership to predict the unlabeled test data. There are many SML approaches in the literature and most of them use a linear score to learn its classifier. However, these approaches fail to elucidate biodiversity from heterogeneous biomedical data. Therefore, their prediction accuracies become low. Partial Least Square Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLS-LDA) is widely used in gene expression (GE) and metabolomics datasets for predicting unlabelled test data. Nevertheless, it also does not consider the non-linearity and heterogeneity pattern of the datasets. Hence, in this study, an improved PLS-LDA (IPLS-LDA) was developed by capturing the heterogeneity of datasets through an unsupervised hierarchical clustering approach. In our approach a non-linear score was calculated by combining all the linear scores obtained from the clustering method. The performance of IPLS-LDA was investigated in a comparison with six frequently used SML methods (SVM, LDA, KNN, Naive Bayes, RF, PLS-LDA) using one simulation data, one colon cancer gene expression data (GED) and one lung cancer metabolomics datasets. The resultant IPLS-LDA predictor achieved accuracy 0.841 using 10-fold cross validation in colon cancer data and accuracy 0.727 from two independent metabolomics data analysis. In both the cases IPLS-LDA outperformed other SML predictors. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in an R package, Uplsda was given in the https://github.com/snotjanu/UplsLda.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy and robustness of many types of analyses performed using RNA-seq data are directly impacted by the quality of the transcript and gene abundance estimates inferred from this data. However, a certain degree of uncertainty is always associated with the transcript abundance estimates. This uncertainty may make many downstream analyses, such as differential testing, difficult for certain transcripts. Conversely, gene-level analysis, though less ambiguous, is often too coarse-grained. To circumvent this problem, methods have proposed grouping transcripts together into distinct inferential units that should be used as a base unit for analysis. However, these methods dont take downstream analysis into account.\n\nWe introduce TreeTerminus, a data-driven approach for grouping transcripts into a tree structure where leaves represent individual transcripts and internal nodes represent an aggregation of a transcript set. TreeTerminus constructs trees such that, on average, the inferential uncertainty decreases as we ascend the tree topology. The tree provides the flexibility to analyze data at nodes that are at different levels of resolution in the tree and can be tuned depending on the analysis of interest. To obtain fixed groups for the downstream analysis, we provide a dynamic programming (DP) approach that can be used to find a cut through the tree that optimizes one of several different objectives.\n\nWe evaluated TreeTerminus on two simulated and two experimental datasets, and observed an improved performance compared to transcripts (leaves) and other methods under several different metrics.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive transcription of eukaryotic genomes requires intricate mechanisms to delineate boundaries for each transcriptional unit. How transcription is efficiently terminated before invading neighboring genes remains an open question. Here, after dissecting the cleavage and polyadenylation landscape using a hybrid approach, we observed thousands of bidirectional termination zones in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These zones are [~]120 bp wide and terminate transcription from both sense and antisense strands in yeast. They are ubiquitously used as termination sites for both coding and non-coding genes. We suggest that the known transcription termination efficiency element, UAUAUA motifs, serves as the central elements in these zones. Notably, bidirectional termination zones are specifically nucleosome depleted, suggesting chromatin structure plays a key role in the formation of bidirectional termination zones in yeast. Finally, we provide evidence for transcriptional interference in these bidirectional termination zones, and expression level of each cleavage site is influenced by sequence contexts both upstream and downstream. We provide the first global fine-scale picture of transcription termination in a eukaryotic genome.",

    "abstract": "Data integration of single-cell data describes the task of embedding datasets obtained from different sources into a common space, so that cells with similar cell type or state end up close from one another in this representation independently from their dataset of origin. Data integration is a crucial early step in most data analysis pipelines involving multiple batches and allows informative data visualization, batch effect reduction, high resolution clustering, accurate label transfer and cell type inference. Many tools have been proposed over the last decade to tackle data integration, and some of them are routinely used today within data analysis workflows. Despite constant endeavors to conduct exhaustive benchmarking studies, a recent surge in the number of these methods has made it difficult to choose one objectively for a given use case. Furthermore, these tools are generally provided as rigid pieces of software allowing little to no user agency on their internal parameters and algorithms, which makes it hard to adapt them to a variety of use cases. In an attempt to address both of these issues at once we introduce transmorph, an ambitious unifying framework for data integration. It allows building complex data integration pipelines by combining existing and original algorithmic modules, and is supported by a rich software ecosystem to easily benchmark modules, analyze and report results. We demonstrate transmorph capabilities and the value of its expressiveness by solving a variety of practical single-cell applications including supervised and unsupervised joint datasets embedding, RNA-seq integration in gene space and label transfer of cell cycle phase within cell cycle genes space. We provide transmorph as a free, open source and computationally efficient python library, with a particular effort to make it compatible with the other state-of-the-art tools and workflows.",

It can be quantified by the classical coefficient of coincidence (CoC) `but this characteristic is highly variable and specific to the pair of chromosomal intervals considered. Several models were proposed to characterize COI on a chromosome-wise level. In the gamma model, the strength of interference is characterized by a shape parameter{nu} , while the gamma-sprinkled two-pathway model (GS) accounts for both interference-dependent and independent crossover (CO) events by fitting a mixture of gamma distributions with v>1 and v=1, correspondingly, and mixture proportions 1-p and p. In reality, COI can vary along chromosomes resulting in low compliance of the fitted model to real data. Additional inconsistency can be caused by common neglecting of possible negative COI in the model, earlier reported for several organisms. In this work, we propose an extension of the GS-model to take possible negative COI into account. We propose a way for data simulation and parameter estimation for such situations.",

Ironically, no direct measure of the influence of membrane hydration level on Laurdan spectra has been available. To address this, we investigated the fluorescence spectrum of Laurdan embedded in solid-supported lipid bilayers as a function of hydration and compared it with the effect of cholesterol - a major membrane fluidity regulator. The effects are illusively similar, hence the results obtained with this probe should be interpreted with caution. The dominant phenomenon governing the changes in the spectrum is the hindrance of the lipid internal dynamics. Furthermore, we unveiled the intriguing mechanism of dehydration-induced redistribution of cholesterol between domains in the phase-separated membrane which reflects yet another regulatory function of cholesterol.",

    "abstract": "Although they account for many thousands of the worlds flowering plants, little is known about the physical/chemical properties of leaf succulents. Eight species in the Namib Desert, South Africa were assessed for leaf area (A) and thickness (z), saturated (Q) and dry mass, relative volume of air (Fa), intrinsic water-us efficiency ({delta}13C), and N, P and (Na+K) contents. As water-storage capacity is a function of Qv and z, this means Q/A (= Qv *z) is an ideal index of succulence compared with specific-leaf-area and other indices that highlight mass rather than volume. Specific gravities have a different relationship with Fa of sclerophyll-mesophylls: rising succulence infers decreasing air content replaced by water rather than dry matter. The trend among succulent species from Argentina/Spain added to our data was characterized by Q/A exceeding 1 mg water/mm2 leaf whose overall slope was ten times that for co-occurring sclerophyll-mesophyll species. (Na+K), N and P concentrations varied on a dry-matter, but not water-volume, basis. Wi relationships were essentially functions of variations in z (transpiration-resistance) and increased metabolic efficiency. We conclude that z and Qv are keys to the special physiological properties of succulent leaves. Including succulents would force many current monotonic relationships to dichotomize.\n\nHighlightThe key to understanding leaf succulents is their high volumetric water content and thick leaves.

Herein, we describe the development of PCM in a murine model of inducible bcr/abl oncogene-driven chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in which metaplasia is causally and temporally linked to the development of leukemia. Mechanistically, CML induced a proinflammatory state within the GI tract that resulted in the production of epithelial-derived IL-33. Binding of IL-33 to ST2 led to the production of IL-9 by type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) which was directly responsible for the induction of PCM in the colon and Paneth cell hyperplasia in the ileum. In addition, IL-9 directed remodeling of the small intestines characterized by goblet and tuft cell hyperplasia along with the expansion of mucosal mast cells. Thus, we identify that an extra intestinal disease can trigger an ILC2/IL-9 immune circuit which induces PCM and regulates epithelial cell fate decisions in the GI tract.",

    "abstract": "Cell differentiation requires the integration of two opposite processes, a stabilizing cellular memory, especially at the transcriptional scale, and a burst of gene expression variability which follows the differentiation induction. Therefore, the actual capacity of a cell to undergo phenotypic change during a differentiation process relies upon a modification in this balance which favors change-inducing gene expression variability. However, there are no experimental data providing insight on how fast the transcriptomes of identical cells would diverge on the scale of the very first two cell divisions during the differentiation process.\n\nIn order to quantitatively address this question, we developed different experimental methods to recover the transcriptomes of related cells, after one and two divisions, while preserving the information about their lineage at the scale of a single cell division. We analyzed the transcriptomes of related cells from two differentiation biological systems (human CD34+ cells and T2EC chicken primary erythrocytic progenitors) using two different single-cell transcriptomics technologies (sc-RT-qPCR and scRNA-seq).\n\nWe identified that the gene transcription profiles of differentiating sister-cells are more similar to each-other than to those of non related cells of the same type, sharing the same environment and undergoing similar biological processes. More importantly, we observed greater discrepancies between differentiating sister-cells than between self-renewing sister-cells. Furthermore, a continuous increase in this divergence from first generation to second generation was observed when comparing differentiating cousin-cells to self renewing cousin-cells.\n\nOur results are in favor of a continuous and gradual erasure of transcriptional memory during the differentiation process.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of human trophoblast stem cells (hTSC) and techniques allowing for trophoblast organoid (TOrg) culture have established promising approaches for studying human trophoblast development. To validate the accuracy of these models at single-cell resolution, we directly compared in vitro TOrg cultures derived from primary progenitor cytotrophoblasts (CTB) or commercially available hTSC lines to in vivo human trophoblasts using a scRNA-seq approach. While patient-derived (PD)- and hTSC-derived TOrgs overall reflect cell differentiation trajectories with accuracy, specific features related to trophoblast state make-up, distinct sub-paths of differentiation, and predicted transcriptional drivers regulating stem cell maintenance were shown to be misaligned in the in vitro platforms. This is best exemplified by the identification of a distinct progenitor state in hTSC-derived TOrgs that showed characteristics of CTB- and extravillous-like cell states. Together, this work provides a comprehensive resource that identifies underlying strengths and limitations of current TOrg platforms.\n\nSummary StatementSingle-cell transcriptomics provides comprehensive comparison between trophoblast organoids derived from commercially available trophoblast stem cells and first-trimester primary human cytotrophoblasts.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIAn integrated single cell transcriptomic atlas of placental and organoid trophoblasts establishes a comprehensive and public web-based resource\nC_LIO_LIDirect comparison of trophoblasts from placental/decidual tissue to trophoblasts extracted from two distinct organoid platforms highlights both conserved and divergent features\nC_LIO_LIComputational modeling describes novel trophoblast states and routes of cell differentiation in human trophoblast organoids\nC_LI\n\nIN BRIEFWhile the merits and utility of current trophoblast organoid cultures have been established, high-resolution assessment and comparison of conserved and divergent features of these systems to cell states and differentiation trajectories of trophoblasts in situ or in vitro has not been performed.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring mouse embryonic development, definitive hematopoiesis is first detected around embryonic day (E) 10.5 in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) arise in the dorsal aortas intra-aortic hematopoietic cell clusters (IAHCs). We have previously reported that a transcription factor Sox17, is expressed in IAHCs, and that, among them, CD45lowc-Kithigh cells have high hematopoietic activity. Furthermore, forced expression of Sox17 in this population of cells can maintain the formation of hematopoietic cell clusters. However, how Sox17 does so, particularly downstream signaling involved, remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to search for new Sox17 targets which contribute to cluster formation with hematopoietic activity.\n\nMethodsRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was done to identify genes that are up- regulated in Sox17-expressing IAHCs as compared with Sox17-negative ones. Among the top 7 highly expressed genes, Rasip1 which had been reported to be a vascular-specific regulator was focused on in this study and firstly the whole-mount immunostaining was done. We conducted a luciferase reporter assay to identify the Sox17 binding site for Rasip1 gene induction. We also analyzed the cluster formation and the multi-lineage colony forming ability of Rasip1-transduced cells and Rasip1-knockdown Sox17-transduced cells.\n\nResultsThe increase of the Rasip1 expression level was observed in Sox17-positive CD45lowc-Kithigh cells as compared with the Sox17-nonexpressing control. Also, the expression level of the Rasip1 gene was increased by the Sox17-nuclear translocation. Rasip1 was expressed on the membrane of IAHCs, overlapping with the endothelial cell marker, CD31, and hematopoietic stem/progenitor marker (HSPC), c-Kit. Overexpression of Rasip1 in CD45lowc-Kithigh cells led to a significant but transient increase in hematopoietic activity, while Rasip1 knock-down in Sox17-transduced cells decreased the cluster formation and diminished the colony-forming ability.\n\nConclusionsRasip1 knockdown in Sox17-transduced CD45lowc-Kithigh cells displayed a significant decrease in the multi-lineage colony forming ability and the cluster size. Rasip1 overexpression in Sox17-untransduced CD45lowc-Kithigh cells led to a significant but transient increase in the multi-lineage colony forming ability, suggesting the presence of a cooperating factor for sustained hematopoietic activity.",

    "abstract": "Multisensory integration (MSI) combines information from more than one sensory modality to elicit behaviors distinct from unisensory behaviors. MSI is best understood in animals with complex brains and specialized centers for parsing sensory information, but the dispersive larvae of sessile marine invertebrates utilize multimodal environmental sensory stimuli to base irreversible settlement decisions on, and most lack complex brains. Here, we examined the sensory determinants of settlement in actinula larvae of the hydrozoan Ectopleura crocea (Cnidaria), which possess a diffuse nerve net. A factorial settlement study revealed that photo-, chemo-, and mechano-sensory cues each influence the settlement response, which was complex and dependent on specific combinations of cues, therefore indicating MSI. Mechanosensory cues either inhibited or enhanced settlement rates depending on the presence or absence of chemical and light cues in the environment. Sensory gene expression over development peaked with developmental competence to settle, which in actinulae, requires cnidocyte discharge. Transcriptome analyses also highlighted several deep homological links between cnidarian and bilaterian mechano- chemo- and photo-sensory pathways. Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies of candidate transcripts suggested cellular partitioning of sensory function among the few cell types that comprise the actinula nervous system, where ubiquitous polymodal sensory neurons with putative chemo- and photo-sensitivity interface with mechanoreceptive cnidocytes. We propose that a simple multisensory processing circuit, involving polymodal chemo/photosensory neurons and mechanoreceptive cnidocytes, is sufficient to explain MSI in actinulae settlement. Our study demonstrates that MSI is not exclusive to complex brains, but likely predated and contextualized their evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe host ranges of individual phages tend to be narrow, yet many applications of phages would benefit from expanded host ranges. Empirical methods have been developed to direct the evolution of phages to attack new strains, but the methods have not been evaluated or compared for their consequences. In particular, how do different methods favor generalist (broad host range) phages over specialist phages? All methods involve exposing phages to two or more novel bacterial strains, but the methods differ in the order in which those hosts are presented through time: Parallel presentation, Sequential presentation, and Mixed presentation.\n\nMethodsWe use a combination of simple analytical methods and numerical analyses to study the effect of these different protocols on the selection of generalist versus specialist phages.\n\nResultsThe three presentation protocols have profoundly different consequences for the evolution of generalist versus specialist phages. Sequential presentation favors generalist almost to the exclusion of specialists, whereas Parallel presentation does the least so. However, other protocol attributes (e.g. the nature of dilution between transfers of phages to new cultures) also have effects on selection and phage maintenance. It is also noted that protocols can be designed to enhance recombination to augment evolution and to reduce stochastic loss of newly-arisen mutants.",

    "abstract": "RIT1 belongs to the family of Ras guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) that regulate many aspects of signal transduction and are drivers of cancer and congenital disorders. RIT1 gain-of-function mutations are found in lung cancer, leukemia, and in the germline of Noonan syndrome individuals with an increased prevalence of cardiac hypertrophy and other congenital heart defects. Pathogenic RIT1 proteins evade proteasomal degradation and promote MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) hyperactivation, yet the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we show that RAF kinases are putative mutant RIT1 effectors necessary for MAPK activation and characterize RIT1 association with plasma membrane lipids and interaction with RAF kinases. We identify critical residues present in the RIT1 hypervariable region that facilitate interaction with negatively charged membrane lipids and show that these are necessary for association with RAF kinases. Although mutant RIT1 binds to RAF kinases directly, it fails to activate RAF-MAPK signaling in the absence of classical Ras proteins. Consistent with aberrant RAF/MEK/ERK activation as a driver of disease, we show that MEK inhibition alleviates cardiac hypertrophy in a mouse model of RIT1-mutant Noonan syndrome. These data shed light on pathogenic RIT1 function and identify avenues for therapeutic intervention.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryElectrostatic plasma membrane association facilitates RIT1-mediated Ras-dependent RAF kinase activation to promote pathogenic MAPK signaling.",
