    "abstract": "SummaryThe integration of vestibular, visual and body cues is a fundamental process in the perception of self-motion and is commonly experienced in an upright posture. However, when the body is tilted in an off-vertical orientation these signals are no longer aligned relative to the influence of gravity. In this study, sensory conflict with the vestibular signal was introduced by manipulating the orientation of the body, generating a mismatch between body and vestibular cues due to gravity in the perception of upright and creating an ambiguous vestibular signal of either head tilt or translation. In a series of temporal-order judgment tasks, participants reported the perceived onset of a visual scene simulating rotation around the yaw axis presented in virtual reality with a paired auditory tone while in an upright, supine and side recumbent body positions. The results revealed that the perceived onset of visual motion was further delayed from zero (i.e., true simultaneity between visual onset and a reference auditory tone) by approximately an additional 30ms when viewed in a supine or side recumbent orientation compared to an upright posture. There were also no significant differences in the timing estimates of the visual motion between all the non-upright orientations. This indicates that the perceived timing of visual motion is negatively impacted by the presence of conflict in the vestibular and body signals due to the direction of gravity and body orientation, even when the mismatch is not in the direct plane of the axis of rotation.",

    "abstract": "People often have good intentions but fail to adhere to them. Implementation intentions, a form of strategic planning, can help people to close this intention-behavior gap. Their effectiveness has been proposed to depend on the mental formation of a stimulus-response association between a trigger and target behavior, thereby creating an  instant habit. If implementation intentions do indeed lead to reliance on habitual control, then this may come at the cost of reduced behavioral flexibility. Furthermore, we would expect a shift from recruitment of corticostriatal brain regions implicated in goal-directed control towards habit regions. To test these ideas, we performed a functional MRI study in which participants received instrumental training supported by either implementation or goal intentions, followed by an outcome-revaluation to test reliance on habitual versus goal-directed control. We found that implementation intentions led to increased efficiency during training, as reflected in higher accuracy, faster reaction times, and decreased engagement of the anterior caudate. However, implementation intentions did not reduce behavioral flexibility when goals changed during the test phase, nor did it affect the underlying corticostriatal pathways. Additionally, this study showed that  slips of action towards devalued outcomes are associated with reduced activity in brain regions implicated in goal-directed control. In conclusion, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings suggest that strategic if-then planning does not lead to a shift from goal-directed towards habitual control.",

    "abstract": "Although stroke is the main cause of brain damage worldwide, stroke therapies are based on blood reperfusion and do not target cerebral parenchyma. Ischemic stroke (representing 87% of all strokes) causes cerebral damage due to oxygen and tissue energy depletion, which lead to acidosis, inflammation, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous gasotransmitter produced by heme oxygenase cleavage of the heme group. CO promotes cytoprotection by limiting inflammation and preventing cell death in several tissues including the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated the protective role of CO in the mouse ischemic stroke model, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by histological analysis when CO is when applied before ischemia. Herein, there are two main novelties. First CO is administrated following stroke, which better mimics its potential future use as therapeutic drug. Secondly, imaging techniques were used to elucidate the effect of this gasotransmitter at the metabolic, vascular and anatomic levels.\n\nThe putative neuroprotective effects of CO following MCAo were assessed by 3 i.p. injections of the CO-releasing molecule CORM-A1 (3 mg/kg), administered 6, 24 and 48h after reperfusion. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed 1 day and 7 days after reperfusion using T2-weighted, diffusion weighted images, proton spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and perfusion (dynamic contrast enhanced images). 1H-MRS also allowed the comparison between metabolite signatures at day 1 versus 7 day following MCAo. Furthermore, CORM-A1 limited the loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity as it reduced the edema formation. Furthermore, the CO donor minimized the metabolite load loss at an early stage after MCAo, both in striatum and cortex.\n\nIn conclusion and based on MRI analysis, CO has a protective role in the recovery from stroke injury, mainly by acting on BBB integrity and brain metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric disease characterized by restricted eating, fear of gaining weight, as well as excessive exercise, and also is often comorbid with emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression. However, the etiology of AN is unknown and the neural mechanism that leads to AN remains to be determined. Here, we show that a specific subpopulation of neurons, marked by the expression of protein kinase C-delta (PKC-{delta}), in two nuclei of the central extended amygdala (EAc)-- central nucleus (CeA) and oval region of bed nucleus of stria terminalis (ovBNST)--regulates development of activity-based anorexia (ABA), the current best animal model of AN. Specifically, simultaneous dual ablation of CeAPKC-{delta} and ovBNSTPKC-{delta} neurons prevents the key phenotypes of ABA: increases in wheel activity, decreases in food intake, and life-threatening body weight loss. However, ablating PKC-{delta} neurons in CeA or ovBNST alone is not sufficient to prevent ABA. Correspondingly, activation of PKC-{delta} neurons in one type of nuclei continues to suppress food intake even when PKC-{delta} neurons in the other nuclei are silenced. Consistent with their role in suppressing food intake when activated, these PKC-{delta} neurons show increased activity with ABA development. Together, our study illuminates how neurons in the amygdala regulate ABA development and supports the complex and heterogenous etiology of AN.",

    "abstract": "The blood flow response to a vasoactive stimulus demonstrates regional heterogeneity across both the healthy brain and in cerebrovascular pathology. The timing of a regional hemodynamic response is emerging as an important biomarker of cerebrovascular dysfunction, as well as a confound within fMRI analyses. Previous research demonstrated that hemodynamic timing is more robustly characterized when a larger systemic vascular response is evoked by a breathing challenge, compared to when only spontaneous fluctuations in vascular physiology are present (i.e., in resting-state data). However, it is not clear whether hemodynamic delays in these two conditions are physiologically interchangeable, and how methodological signal-to-noise factors may limit their agreement. To address this, we generated whole-brain maps of hemodynamic delays in nine healthy adults. We assessed the agreement of voxel-wise gray matter (GM) hemodynamic delays between two conditions: resting-state and breath-holding. We found that delay values demonstrated poor agreement when considering all GM voxels, but increasingly greater agreement when limiting analyses to voxels showing strong correlation with the GM mean time-series. Voxels showing the strongest agreement with the GM mean time-series were primarily located near large venous vessels, however these voxels explain some, but not all, of the observed agreement in timing. Increasing the degree of spatial smoothing of the fMRI data enhanced the correlation between individual voxel time-series and the GM mean time-series. These results suggest that signal-to-noise factors may be limiting the accuracy of voxel-wise timing estimates and hence their agreement between the two data segments. In conclusion, caution must be taken when using voxel-wise delay estimates from resting-state and breathing-task data interchangeably, and additional work is needed to evaluate their relative sensitivity and specificity to aspects of vascular physiology and pathology.",

    "abstract": "Humans exhibit lateralization such that most individuals typically show a preference for using one arm over the other for a range of movement tasks. The computational aspects of movement control leading to these differences in skill are not yet understood. It has been hypothesized that the dominant and non-dominant arms differ in terms of the use of predictive or impedance control mechanisms. However, previous studies present confounding factors that prevented clear conclusions: either the performances were compared across two different groups, or in a design in which asymmetrical transfer between limbs could take place. To address these concerns, we studied a reach adaptation task during which healthy volunteers performed movements with their right and left arms in random order. We performed two experiments. Experiment 1 (18 participants) focused on adaptation to the presence of a perturbing force field and Experiment 2 (12 participants) focused on rapid adaptations in feedback responses. The randomization of the left and right arm led to simultaneous adaptation, allowing us to study lateralization in single individuals with symmetrical and minimal transfer between limbs. This design revealed that participants were able to adapt control of both arms, and that adaptation was greater in the dominant arm than in the non-dominant. We also observed that the non-dominant arm showed a different control strategy compatible with robust control when adapting to the force field perturbation. EMG data showed that these differences in control were not caused by differences in co-contraction across the arms. Thus, instead of assuming differences in predictive or reactive control schemes, our data show that in the context of optimal control, both arms can adapt, and that the non-dominant arm uses a more robust, model-free strategy likely to compensate for less accurate internal representations of movement dynamics.\n\nSignificance statementWe studied a reach adaptation task during which volunteers performed the task with their right and left arm randomly. The randomization of the arms allowed us to study lateralization in single individuals with symmetrical and minimal transfer between limbs. We observed a slightly greater adaptation of the dominant arm in the force applied to counter the perturbation. Moreover, the non-dominant arm showed a more robust control strategy when adapting to the force field perturbation, which enabled similar deviations despite faster movements. These interlimb differences were not caused by differences in co-contraction across the two arms. Our results suggest that both arms can adapt to the presence of a force field but the non-dominant arm uses a more robust, model-free strategy.",

    "abstract": "The neural mechanisms of motor planning have been extensively studied in rodents. Frontal cortical areas seem to encode upcoming choice, but limitations of typical tasks make it challenging to determine whether activity represents a planned movement direction in a self-centered reference frame or a goal position in a world-centered reference frame. Here, we trained rats to make delayed visually-guided orienting movements to six different directions, with four different target positions for each direction, which allowed us to disentangle position versus direction tuning in neural activity. We recorded single unit activity from the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) in secondary motor cortex, a region involved in planning orienting movements. We found neurons in the FOF that were tuned for specific directions of movement and also neurons that fired while animals were at specific port positions. Interestingly, after the visual cue onset, movement direction tuning emerged earlier than target position tuning. At the level of individual neurons, the current head position modulated the planned movement direction as a gain field. These results suggest the FOF participates not only in the motoric processes of sensorimotor behavior, which could happen strictly in egocentric coordinates, but in more complex aspects like reference frame transformation or maintaining a stable model of the world during movements.",

    "abstract": "Psychotic disorders are conceptualized as brain-network diseases and both the cerebellum (CB) and basal ganglia (BG) are implicated in widely used conceptual models. Previous research has focused on these structures and their respective circuits as distinct, however, both are functionally and anatomically connected to each other and to cortical networks via domain-specific, topographically organized thalamo-cortical loops. Currently, it is unclear how CB-BG network dysfunction may play a mechanistic role in the course of psychosis; however, network global efficiency (GE), a measure of functional integration, is a novel approach that aims to represent cognitive and motor CB-BG network (CCBN, MCBN, respectively) connectivity in cross- sectional groups of healthy control (HC), clinical high-risk (CHR), early course psychosis (ECP), and chronic psychosis (CP) participants. We compared network GE between groups and inspected individual differences in CCBN- and MCBN-GE as it relates to group membership and to psychosis symptoms. We also associated CB-BG network GE with cortical network GE. Results indicated that CCBN-GE was associated with cognitive dysfunction and lower in CHR individuals, compared to HC and CP; while MCBN was associated with negative psychosis symptoms. Last, we detailed CB-BG associations with sensory, motor, default mode, and salience networks across groups, with group effects demonstrating complex differences within the ECP group. Findings indicating that CB-BG network dysfunction may play an important role in early pathogenesis and authors argue for CB-BG dysfunction to be analyzed from a network perspective. Future work is needed however to incorporate this approach into our understanding of psychosis.",

    "abstract": "During development, retinal axons create broad and imprecise connections in the thalamus. This topology, very different from adults, supplies developing thalamic neurons with locally homogeneous synaptic currents and should cause spike correlation between thalamocortical neurons on a millisecond timescale. Such correlations have not been observed in vivo, at these ages, and would likely be maladaptive. Here, we use a biophysical model of the visual thalamus with the membrane and synaptic properties of 7-10 day-old mice to show that the developmentally appropriate dominance of NMDA-receptor currents and absence of strong recurrent inhibitory and excitatory connections prevents precise correlation and preserves topographic information in thalamic spikes. We illustrate possible reasons for this desynchronization using a phenomenological cortical model, which shows impaired network diversity when driven with precisely correlated inputs. Our results suggest that developing synapses and circuits evolved mechanisms to compensate for detrimental, \"parasitic\" correlation arising from the unrefined and immature circuit.",

We hypothesized that the low-dimensional latent neural representations of motor behavior, known to be preserved across time, might also be preserved across individuals, and allow us to circumvent this problem. We trained a decoder to predict the electromyographic (EMG) activity for a \"source\" monkey from the latent signals of motor cortex. We then used Canonical Correlation Analysis to align the latent signals of a \"target\" monkey to those of the source. These decoders were as accurate across monkeys as they were across sessions for a given monkey. Remarkably, the same process with latent signals from a human participant with tetraplegia was within 90% of the with-monkey decoding across session accuracy. Our findings suggest that consistent representations of motor activity exist across animals and even species. Discovering this common representation is a crucial first step in designing iBCI decoders that perform well without large amounts of data and supervised subject-specific tuning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is an emerging approach to restore sensation to people with neurological injury or disease. Biomimetic microstimulation, or stimulus trains that mimic neural activity in the brain through encoding of onset and offset transients, could improve the utility of ICMS for BCI applications, but how biomimetic microstimulation affects neural activation is not understood. Stimulus induced depression of neural activity (decreases in evoked intensity over time) is also a potential barrier to clinical implementation of sensory feedback, and biomimetic microstimulation may reduce this effect.\n\nObjectiveWe evaluated how biomimetic trains change the calcium response, spatial distribution, and depression of neurons in the somatosensory and visual cortices.\n\nMethodsCalcium responses of neurons were measured in Layer 2/3 of visual and somatosensory cortices of anesthetized GCaMP6s mice in response to ICMS trains with fixed amplitude and frequency (Fixed) and three biomimetic ICMS trains that increased the stimulation intensity during the onset and offset of stimulation by modulating the amplitude (BioAmp), frequency (BioFreq), or amplitude and frequency (BioBoth). ICMS was provided for either 1-s with 4-s breaks (Short) or for 30-s with 15-s breaks (Long).\n\nResultsBioAmp and BioBoth trains evoked distinct onset and offset transients in recruited neural populations, while BioFreq trains evoked population activity similar to Fixed trains. Individual neurons had heterogeneous responses primarily based on how quickly they depressed to ICMS, where neurons farther from the electrode depressed faster and a small subpopulation (1-5%) were modulated by BioFreq trains. Neurons that depressed to Short trains were also more likely to depress to Long trains, but Long trains induced more depression overall due to the increased stimulation length. Increasing the amplitude during the hold phase resulted in an increase in recruitment and intensity which resulted in more depression and reduced offset responses. Biomimetic amplitude modulation reduced stimulation induced depression by 14.6{+/-}0.3% for Short and 36.1{+/-}0.6% for Long trains. Ideal observers were 0.031{+/-}0.009 s faster for onset detection and 1.33{+/-}0.21 s faster for offset detection with biomimetic amplitude encoding.\n\nConclusionsBiomimetic amplitude modulation evokes distinct onset and offset transients, reduces depression of neural calcium activity, and decreases total charge injection for sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces by lowering recruitment of neurons during long maintained periods of ICMS. In contrast, biomimetic frequency modulation evokes distinct onset and offset transients in a small subpopulation of neurons but also reduces depression in recruited neurons by reducing the rate of activation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of misfolded -synuclein in the form of Lewy pathology. While most cases are sporadic, there are rare genetic mutations that cause disease and more common variants that increase incidence of disease. The most prominent genetic mutations for PD and DLB are in the GBA1 and LRRK2 genes. GBA1 mutations are associated with decreased glucocerebrosidase activity and lysosomal accumulation of its lipid substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Previous studies have shown a link between this enzyme and lipids even in sporadic PD. However, it is unclear how the protein pathologies of disease are related to enzyme activity and glycosphingolipid levels. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined quantitative protein pathology, glucocerebrosidase activity and lipid substrates in parallel from 4 regions of 91 brains with no neurological disease, idiopathic, GBA1-linked, or LRRK2-linked PD and DLB. We find that several biomarkers are altered with respect to mutation and disease severity. We found mild association of glucocerebrosidase activity with disease, but a strong association of glucosylsphingosine with -synuclein pathology, irrespective of genetic mutation. This association suggests that Lewy pathology precipitates changes in lipid levels related to disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are used in a wide array of experimental situations for driving expression of biosensors, recombinases and opto/chemo-genetic actuators in the brain. However, conventional approaches for minimally invasive, spatially precise and ultra-sparse AAV mediated transduction of cells during imaging experiments, has remained a significant challenge. Here we show that intravenous injection of commercially available AAVs at different doses, combined with laser based perforation of single cortical capillaries through a cranial widow, allows for ultra-sparse, titrate-able, and micron level precision for delivery of viral vectors with relatively little inflammation or tissue damage. Further, we show the utility of this approach for eliciting sparse expression of GCaMP6, channel-rhodopsin or fluorescent reporters in neurons and astrocytes within specific functional domains in normal and stroke damaged cortex. This technique represents a facile approach for targeted delivery of viral vectors that should assist in the study of cell types and circuits in the cerebral cortex.",

    "abstract": "In motor cortex, behaviorally-relevant neural responses are entangled with irrelevant signals, which complicates the study of encoding and decoding mechanisms. It remains unclear whether behaviorally-irrelevant signals could conceal some critical truth. One solution is to accurately separate behaviorally-relevant and irrelevant signals, but this approach remains elusive due to the unknown ground truth of behaviorally-relevant signals. Therefore, we propose a framework to define, extract, and validate behaviorally-relevant signals. Analyzing separated signals in three monkeys performing different reaching tasks, we found neural responses previously considered useless encode rich behavioral information in complex nonlinear ways. These responses are critical for neuronal redundancy and reveal movement behaviors occupy a higher-dimensional neural space than previously expected. Surprisingly, when incorporating often-ignored neural dimensions, behavioral information can be decoded linearly as accurately as nonlinear decoding, suggesting linear readout is performed in motor cortex. Our findings prompt that separating behaviorally-relevant signals may help uncover more hidden cortical mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The optimization of mental practice (MP) protocols matters for sport and motor rehabilitation. In this study, we were interested in the benefits of moderate-intensity exercise in MP, given its positive effects on the acquisition and consolidation of motor skills induced by physical practice (PP). Four experimental groups were tested: i) physical practice without exercise (PP-Rest), ii) mental practice without exercise (MP-Rest), iii) mental practice preceded by Exercise (Exe-MP), and iv) mental practice followed by Exercise (MP-Exe). We hypothesized that exercise before MP would further increase speed and accuracy at a finger-sequence task measured right after MP (potentiation of motor acquisition), whereas exercise after MP would further increase speed and accuracy the day after MP (promotion of motor consolidation). Motor performance (movement speed and accuracy) was measured during a sequential finger tapping task before (Pre-Test), immediately after (Post-Test 0h, acquisition), and one day after practice (Post-Test 24h, consolidation). Results suggest that exercise before MP did not additionally improve motor acquisition in comparison to the MP-Rest group (both for accuracy and speed, ps>0.05). Interestingly, moderate-intensity exercise after MP further increased performance during motor consolidation (speed, p=0.051; accuracy, p=0.028), at the level of the PP-Rest group. This novel finding represents a promising advance in the optimization of mental practice protocols in sport-related and rehabilitation settings.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal intracellular accumulation of Tau aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and other Tauopathies, such as Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which can be caused by mutations of Tau. Mutated and pathological Tau can undergo a range of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that might trigger or modulate disease pathology. Recent studies indicate that modification of wild type Tau by Small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO isoform 1 (SUMO1) controls Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, suggesting that SUMOylation acts as a central regulator of Taus biochemical properties. Besides SUMO1, Tau is modified by SUMO2/3, however the consequences of this modification have not been investigated. Here, using viral approaches on primary hippocampal neurons, transgenic mice expressing mutant Tau and SUMO2, and iPSC-derived neurons from FTD patients, we evaluated whether SUMO2/3 conjugation modifies the neurodegenerative disease pathology associated with the aggregation-prone mutant Tau P301L, P301S, and R406W variants. We found that mutant forms of Tau are targets of SUMO2/3, and SUMO2/3 conjugation is neuroprotective. Importantly, expression of mutant Tau is accompanied by a significant reduction of SUMO2/3 conjugation levels, and restoring levels of SUMO2 reduces mutant Tau aggregation and phosphorylation in all model systems Furthermore, overexpression of SUMO2 restores levels of pre- and post-synaptic markers, associated with a complete rescue of the LTP and memory deficits in transgenic mice expressing mutant Tau. These findings bring to light the potential therapeutic implication of manipulating SUMO conjugation to detoxify Tau through PTM-based approaches.",

Our approach combines a flow cytometry (FC) antibody panel targeting brain cells with a computational pipeline called CelltypeR, which has scripts for aligning and transforming datasets, optimizing unsupervised clustering, annotating, and quantifying cell types, and comparing cells across different conditions. We applied this workflow to human iPSC-derived midbrain organoids and identified the expected brain cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, radial glia and oligodendrocytes. By defining gates based on the expression levels of our protein markers, we were able to perform Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) astrocytes, radial glia, and neurons, cell types were then confirmed by scRNAseq. Among the sorted neurons, we identified three subgroups of dopamine (DA) neurons, including one which was similar to substantia nigra DA neurons, the cell type most vulnerable in Parkinsons disease. Overall, our adaptable analysis framework provides a generalizable method for reproducibly identifying cell types across FC datasets.",

[18F]-NT160 displayed excellent pharmacokinetic and imaging characteristics: brain uptake is high in gray matter regions, leading to high-quality PET images; tissue kinetics are appropriate for an 18F tracer and specific binding for class-IIa HDACs is demonstrated by self-blockade. Higher uptake with [18F]-NT160 was observed in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex while there was relatively lower uptake in the cerebellum and striatum. Overall, our current studies with [18F]-NT160 will likely facilitate the development and clinical translation of class-IIa HDACs of the next generation of PET tracers for imaging and targeted therapy of cancer and the diseases of the central nervous system (CNS).",

However, the throughput in recordings is limited because of the manual replacement of patch-pipettes after each attempt which are often also unsuccessful. This has been overcome by automated cleaning the tips in detergent solutions, allowing to reuse the pipette for further recordings. Here, we developed a novel method of automated cleaning by sonicating the tips within the bath solution wherein the cells are placed, reducing the risk of contaminating the bath solution or internal solution of the recording pipette by any detergent and avoiding the necessity of a separate chamber for cleaning. We showed that the patch-pipettes can be used consecutively at least 10 times and that the cleaning process does not negatively impact neither the brain slices nor other patched neurons. This method, combined with automated patch-clamp, highly improves the throughput for single and especially multiple recordings.",

    "abstract": "Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can be transformative for people living with chronic paralysis. BMIs translate brain signals into computer commands, bypassing neurological impairments and enabling people with neurological injury or disease to control computers, robots, and more with nothing but thought. State-of-the-art BMIs have already made this future a reality in limited clinical trials. However, high performance BMIs currently require highly invasive electrodes in the brain. Device degradation limits longevity to about 5 years. Their field of view is small, restricting the number, and type, of applications possible. The next generation of BMI technology should include being longer lasting, less invasive, and scalable to sense activity from large regions of the brain. Functional ultrasound neuroimaging is a recently developed technique that meets these criteria. In this present study, we demonstrate the first online, closed-loop ultrasonic brain-machine interface. We used 2 Hz real-time functional ultrasound to measure the neurovascular activity of the posterior parietal cortex in two nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed memory-guided movements. We streamed neural signals into a classifier to predict the intended movement direction. These predictions controlled a behavioral task in real-time while the NHP did not produce overt movements. Both NHPs quickly succeeded in controlling up to eight independent directions using the BMI. Furthermore, we present a simple method to \"pretrain\" the BMI using data from previous sessions. This enables the BMI to work immediately from the start of a session without acquiring extensive additional training data. This work establishes, for the first time, the feasibility of an ultrasonic BMI and prepares for future work on a next generation of minimally invasive BMIs that can restore function to patients with neurological, physical, or even psychiatric impairments.",

    "abstract": "Retinal dystrophies of genetic origin are often associated with mutations in the genes involved in the phototransduction cascade in photoreceptors, a paradigmatic signaling pathway mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. Photoreceptor viability is strictly dependent on the levels of the second messengers cGMP and Ca2+. Here we explored the possibility of modulating the phototransduction cascade in mouse rods using direct or liposome-mediated administration of a recombinant protein crucial for regulating the interplay of the second messengers in photoreceptor outer segments. The effects of administration of the free and liposome-encapsulated human guanylate cyclase-activating protein (GCAP1) were compared in biological systems of increasing complexity (in cyto, ex vivo, and in vivo). Analysis of protein biodistribution and direct measurement of functional alteration in rod photoresponses show that the exogenous GCAP1 protein is fully incorporated into the mouse retina and photoreceptor outer segments. Furthermore, only in the presence of a point mutation associated with cone-rod dystrophy in humans p.(E111V), protein delivery induces a disease-like electrophysiological phenotype, consistent with constitutive activation of the retinal guanylate cyclase. Our study demonstrates that both direct and liposome-mediated protein delivery are powerful tools for targeting signaling cascades in neuronal cells, which could be particularly important for the treatment of autosomal dominant genetic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The entorhinal cortex (EC) is central to the brains navigation system. Its subregions are conventionally thought to compute dichotomous representations for spatial processing: medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) provides a global spatial map, while lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) encodes specific sensory details of experience. While local recordings of EC circuits have amassed a vast catalogue of specialized cell types that could support navigation computations in the brain, we have little direct evidence for how these signals are actually transmitted outside of the EC to its primary downstream reader, the hippocampus, which itself is critical for the formation of spatial and episodic memories. Here we exploit in vivo sub-cellular imaging to directly record from EC axon terminals as they locally innervate hippocampal area CA1, while mice performed navigational and spatial learning tasks in virtual reality. We find both distinct and overlapping representations of task, location, and context in both MEC and LEC axons. While MEC transmitted a highly location- and context-specific code, LEC inputs were strongly biased by ongoing navigational goals and reward. Surprisingly, the position of the animal could be accurately decoded from either entorhinal subregion. Our results challenge prevailing dogma on the routing of spatial and non-spatial information from the cortex to the hippocampus, indicating that cortical interactions upstream of the hippocampus are critical for combining these processing streams to support navigation and memory.",

Besides connectivity and boundaries, sensory or functional similarities of landmarks have been shown to influence construction of regions. In natural spaces, regions and places are usually named and these names provide additional cues for the cognitive construction of regions. In this study we investigate the role of semantic similarities of place names in the formation of regions in a virtual environment with homogeneous connectivity. Place names were selected and distributed in a way that two alternative semantic categorizations were possible which corresponded to two equally valid regionalisations of the same environment. Region perception was assessed by having subjects choose between two equidistant routes crossing different numbers of region boundaries (classification consistent route choice). In a priming phase, subjects were biased to sort the landmark names in one or the other categorization scheme. In the test phase, subjects preferably selected routes with a lower number of region crossings according to the categorization previously discovered. The results show that perceived semantic similarity of place names does affect route choice and the formation of spatial regions.",

    "abstract": "Axons must project to particular brain regions, contact adjacent neurons, and choose appropriate synaptic targets to form a nervous system. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain synaptic partnership choice. In a  lock-and-key mechanism, first proposed by Sperrys chemoaffinity model1, a neuron selectively chooses a synaptic partner among several different, adjacent target cells, based on a specific molecular recognition code2. Alternatively, Peters rule posits that neurons indiscriminately form connections with other neuron types in their proximity; hence, neighborhood choice, dictated by initial neuronal process outgrowth and position, is the sole predictor of connectivity3,4. However, whether Peters rule plays an important role in synaptic wiring remains unresolved5. To assess the nanoscale relationship between neuronal adjacency and connectivity, we evaluate the expansive set of C. elegans connectomes. We find that synaptic connectivity can be accurately modeled as a path-length-dependent process of neuronal adjacency and brain strata, offering strong support for Peters rule as an organizational principle of C. elegans brain wiring.",
