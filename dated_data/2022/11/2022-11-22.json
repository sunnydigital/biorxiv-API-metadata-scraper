    "abstract": "Evidence for positivity and optimism bias abounds in high-level belief updates. However, no consensus has been reached regarding whether learning asymmetries exists in more elementary forms of updates such as reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, the learning asymmetry concerns the sensitivity difference in incorporating positive and negative prediction errors (PE) into value estimation, namely the asymmetry of learning rates associated with positive and negative PEs. Although RL has been established as a canonical framework in interpreting agent and environment interactions, the direction of the learning rate asymmetry remains controversial. Here, we propose that part of the controversy stems from the fact that people may have different value expectations before entering the learning environment. Such default value expectation influences how PEs are calculated and consequently biases subjects choices. We test this hypothesis in two learning experiments with stable or varying reinforcement probabilities, across monetary gains, losses and gain-loss mixtures environments. Our results consistently support the model incorporating asymmetric learning rates and initial value expectation, highlighting the role of initial expectation in value update and choice preference. Further simulation and model parameter recovery analyses confirm the unique contribution of initial value expectation in accessing learning rate asymmetry.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhile RL model has long been applied in modeling learning behavior, where value update stands in the core of the learning process, it remains controversial whether and how learning is biased when updating from positive and negative PEs. Here, through model comparison, simulation and recovery analyses, we show that accurate identification of learning asymmetry is contingent on taking into account of subjects default value expectation in both monetary gain and loss environments. Our results stress the importance of initial expectation specification, especially in studies investigating learning asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition after central nervous system (CNS) injury leads to inhibitory scarring in mammals, whereas it facilitates axon regeneration in the zebrafish. However, the molecular basis of these different fates is not understood. Here, we identify small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) as a causal factor in regeneration failure. We demonstrate that the SLRPs Chondroadherin, Fibromodulin, Lumican, and Prolargin are enriched in human, but not zebrafish, CNS lesions. Targeting SLRPs to the zebrafish injury ECM inhibits axon regeneration and functional recovery. Mechanistically, we find that SLRPs confer structural and mechanical properties to the lesion environment that are adverse to axon growth. Our study reveals SLRPs as previously unknown inhibitory ECM factors in the human CNS that impair axon regeneration by modifying tissue mechanics and structure.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYComposition, structural organization, and mechanical properties of the injury ECM direct central nervous system regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an essential modulator for neuroplasticity in sensory and emotional domains. Here, we investigated the role of CCK in motor learning using a single pellet reaching task in mice. Mice with a knockout of cck gene (CCK-/-) or blockade of CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) showed defective motor learning ability; the success rate of retrieving reward remained at the baseline level compared to the wildtype mice with significantly increased success rate. We observed no long-term potentiation (LTP) upon high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in the motor cortex of CCK-/- mice, indicating a possible association between motor learning deficiency and neuronal plasticity in the motor cortex. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated that the deficiency of CCK signalling disrupted the refinement of population neuronal activity in the motor cortex during motor skill training. Anatomical tracing revealed direct projections from CCK-expressing neurons in the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Inactivating the CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex using chemogenetic methods significantly suppressed motor learning, and intraperitoneal application of CCK4, a tetrapeptide CCK agonist, rescued the motor learning deficits of CCK-/- mice. In summary, our results suggest that CCK, which could be provided from the rhinal cortex, enables neuroplasticity in the motor cortex leading to motor skill learning.",

    "abstract": "Anopheles mosquitoes, as vectors for the malaria parasite, are a global threat to human health. To find and bite a human, they utilize neurons within their sensory appendages. However, the identity and quantification of sensory appendage neurons are lacking. Here we use a neurogenetic approach to label all neurons in Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. We utilize the Homology Assisted CRISPR Knock-in (HACK) approach to generate a T2A-QF2w knock-in of the synaptic gene bruchpilot. We use a membrane-targeted GFP reporter to visualize the neurons in the brain and to quantify neurons in all major chemosensory appendages (antenna, maxillary palp, labella, tarsi). By comparing labeling of brp>GFP and Orco>GFP mosquitoes, we predict the extent of neurons expressing Ionotropic Receptors or other chemosensory receptors. This work introduces a valuable genetic tool for the functional analysis of Anopheles mosquito neurobiology and initiates characterization of the sensory neurons that guide mosquito behavior.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=178 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517370v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ebbf69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@63bcd2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bab0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18799a4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A key feature of advanced brain aging includes structural defects of intracortical myelin that are associated with secondary neuroinflammation. A similar pathology is seen in specific myelin mutant mice that model  advanced brain aging and exhibit a range of behavioral abnormalities. However, the cognitive assessment of these mutants is problematic because myelin-dependent motor-sensory functions are required for quantitative behavioral readouts. To better understand the role of cortical myelin integrity for higher brain functions, we generated mice lacking Plp1, encoding the major integral myelin membrane protein, selectively in ventricular zone stem cells of the mouse forebrain. In contrast to conventional Plp1 null mutants, subtle myelin defects were restricted to the cortex, hippocampus and underlying callosal tracts. Moreover, forebrain-specific Plp1 mutants exhibited no defect of basic motor-sensory performance at any age tested. Surprisingly, several behavioral alterations reported for conventional Plp1 null mice (Gould et al., 2018) were absent and even social interactions appeared normal. However, with novel behavioral paradigms, we determined catatonia-like symptoms and isolated executive dysfunction in both genders. This suggests that loss of myelin integrity has an impact on cortical connectivity and underlies specific defects of executive function. These observations are likewise relevant for human neuropsychiatric conditions and other myelin-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Speech comprehension is a complex neural process on which relies on activation and integration of multiple brain regions. In the current study, we evaluated whether speech comprehension can be investigated by neural tracking. Neural tracking is the phenomenon in which the brain responses time-lock to the rhythm of specific features in continuous speech. These features can be acoustic, i.e., acoustic tracking, or derived from the content of the speech using language properties, i.e., language tracking. We evaluated whether neural tracking of speech differs between a comprehensible story, an incomprehensible story, and a word list. We evaluated the neural responses to speech of 19 participants (6 men). No significant difference regarding acoustic tracking was found. However, significant language tracking was only found for the comprehensible story. The most prominent effect was visible to word surprisal, a language feature at the word level. The neural response to word surprisal showed a prominent negativity between 300 and 400 ms, similar to the N400 in evoked response paradigms. This N400 was significantly more negative when the story was comprehended, i.e., when words could be integrated in the context of previous words. These results show that language tracking can capture the effect of speech comprehension.\n\nSignificance statementMost neural tracking studies focus on how the brain tracks acoustic speech features. However, whether acoustic tracking reflects speech comprehension is unclear. Therefore, in the pursuit of finding a neural marker for speech comprehension, language tracking might be a more suitable candidate. The results of this study showed that, indeed, language tracking can capture the effect of speech comprehension. This indicates that language tracking is a potential neural marker of speech comprehension. Such a neural marker would allow testing speech comprehension in populations that are currently difficult to test with behavioral tests, such as young children and persons with cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "We can sense an objects shape by vision or touch. Previous studies suggested that the inferolateral occipitotemporal cortex (ILOTC) implements supramodal shape representations as it responds more to seeing or touching objects than shapeless textures. However, such activation in the anterior portion of the ventral visual pathway could be due to the conceptual representation of an object or visual imagery triggered by touching an object. We addressed these possibilities by directly comparing shape and conceptual representations in early blind (who lack visual experience/imagery) and sighted participants. We found that bilateral ILOTC in both groups showed stronger activation during a shape verification task than during a conceptual verification task made on the names of the same manmade objects. Moreover, the distributed activity in the ILOTC encoded shape similarity but not conceptual association among objects. Besides the ILOTC, we also found shape representation in both groups bilateral ventral premotor cortices and intraparietal sulcus, a frontoparietal circuit relating to object grasping and haptic processing. In contrast, the conceptual verification task activated both groups left perisylvian brain network relating to language processing, and, interestingly, the cuneus in early blind participants only. The ILOTC had stronger functional connectivity to frontoparietal circuit than to the left perisylvian network, forming a modular structure specialized in shape representation. Our results conclusively support that the ILOTC selectively implements shape representation independently of visual experience, and this unique functionality likely comes from its privileged connection to the frontoparietal haptic circuit.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a powerful multimodal technique for imaging the brain, but its use in neurofeedback experiments has been limited by EEG noise caused by the MRI environment. Neurofeedback studies typically require analysis of EEG in real time, but EEG acquired inside the scanner is heavily contaminated with ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, a high-amplitude artifact locked to the cardiac cycle. Although techniques for removing BCG artifacts do exist, they are either not suited to real-time, low-latency applications, such as neurofeedback, or have limited efficacy. We propose and validate a new open-source BCG removal software called EEG-LLAMAS (Low Latency Artifact Mitigation Acquisition Software), which adapts and advances existing artifact removal techniques for low-latency experiments. We first used simulations to validate LLAMAS in data with known ground truth. We found that LLAMAS performed better than the best publicly-available real-time BCG removal technique, optimal basis sets (OBS), in terms of its ability to recover EEG waveforms, power spectra, and slow wave phase. To determine whether LLAMAS would be effective in practice, we then used it to conduct real-time EEG-fMRI recordings in healthy adults, using a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) task. We found that LLAMAS was able to recover the SSVEP in real time, and recovered the power spectra collected outside the scanner better than OBS. We also measured the latency of LLAMAS during live recordings, and found that it introduced a lag of less than 50ms on average. The low latency of LLAMAS, coupled with its improved artifact reduction, can thus be effectively used for EEG-fMRI neurofeedback. This platform enables closed-loop experiments which previously would have been prohibitively difficult, such as those that target short-duration EEG events, and is shared openly with the neuroscience community.",

    "abstract": "Adults with bipolar disorder or epileptic seizures are commonly prescribed sodium valproate. In utero exposure to this drug is linked to a multitude of defects in normal brain development, from neural tube defects to autism spectrum disorders. During the course of brain development, neural precursor cells (NPCs) give rise to neurons and glia, and therefore to understand the valproate-induced defects, it is crucial to understand its effect on NPCs. Two NPC lines, both derived from healthy individuals, were used for all experiments. Cells were treated with 0.7mM valproate for one week. Fresh media (+/- drug) was replenished every alternate day. RNA was extracted on day 7 of drug treatment, and transcriptomics performed. All experiments were performed in biological replicates. Genes that showed >1-fold difference (with FDR adjusted q-value [&le;] 0.05) were considered differentially expressed. We further investigated the interacting partners of the differentially expressed genes using PINOT, as well as cellular pathways using DAVID. Our primary endpoint of analysis were genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) with valproate treatment in both the NPC lines used. We found 21 such genes that were common in the two lines. PINOT revealed 504 interacting partners of the DEGs. Functional annotation analysis showed significant enrichment of four signaling pathways - Wnt, Notch, Rho-GTPase and PI3K-AKT. While the role of Rho-GTPase is a novel finding, we have replicated previously reported findings on Wnt, Notch and PI3K-Akt pathways, which further strengthens their role in mediating neurodevelopmental anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the physiological correlates of cognitive overload has implications for gauging the limits of human cognition, for developing novel methods to define cognitive overload, and for mitigating the negative outcomes associated with overload. Most previous psychophysiological studies manipulated verbal working memory load in a narrow range (an average load of 5 items). It is unclear, however, how the nervous system responds to working memory load exceeding typical capacity limits. The objective of the current study was to characterize the central and autonomic nervous system changes associated with memory overload, by means of combined recording of EEG and pupillometry. Eighty-six participants were presented with a digit span task involving the serial auditory presentation of items. Each trial consisted of sequences of either 5, 9, or 13 digits, each separated by 2 seconds. Both theta activity and pupil size, after the initial rise, expressed a pattern of a short plateau and a decrease with reaching the state of memory overload, indicating that pupil size and theta possibly have similar neural mechanisms. Based on the described above triphasic pattern of pupil size temporal dynamics, we concluded that cognitive overload causes physiological systems to reset, and to release effort. Although memory capacity limits were exceeded and effort was released (as indicated by pupil dilation), alpha continued to decrease with increasing memory load. These results suggest that associating alpha with the focus of attention and distractor suppression is not warranted.",

The idea of estimating the chronological age from (different modalities of) magnetic resonance images proved to be an interesting field of research due to the simplicity of its interpretation and its potential use as a biomarker of brain health. With the advancement of deep learning methods that are starting to dominate the field, it may seem like standard machine learning methods are not competitive anymore.\n\nHere we present our revised BrainAGE framework that combines multiple weighted BrainAGE models.

    "abstract": "Humans display vast clinical variability upon SARS-CoV-2 infection1-3, partly due to genetic and immunological factors4. However, the magnitude of population differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the mechanisms underlying such variation remain unknown. Here we report single-cell RNA-sequencing data for peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 222 healthy donors of various ancestries stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus. We show that SARS-CoV-2 induces a weaker, but more heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene activity than influenza A virus, and a unique pro-inflammatory signature in myeloid cells. We observe marked population differences in transcriptional responses to viral exposure that reflect environmentally induced cellular heterogeneity, as illustrated by higher rates of cytomegalovirus infection, affecting lymphoid cells, in African-descent individuals. Expression quantitative trait loci and mediation analyses reveal a broad effect of cell proportions on population differences in immune responses, with genetic variants having a narrower but stronger effect on specific loci. Additionally, natural selection has increased immune response differentiation across populations, particularly for variants associated with SARS-CoV-2 responses in East Asians. We document the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which Neanderthal introgression has altered immune functions, such as its impact on the myeloid response in Europeans. Finally, colocalization analyses reveal an overlap between the genetic architecture of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Collectively, these findings suggest that adaptive evolution targeting immunity has also contributed to current disparities in COVID-19 risk.",

    "abstract": "Toxicity of accumulating substrates is a significant problem in several disorders of valine and isoleucine degradation notably short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1 or crotonase) deficiency, 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) deficiency, propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic aciduria (MMA). Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD8) and short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD, ACADSB) function in the valine and isoleucine degradation pathways, respectively. Deficiencies of these acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) enzymes are considered biochemical abnormalities with limited or no clinical consequences. We investigated whether substrate reduction therapy through inhibition of ACAD8 and SBCAD can limit the accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates in disorders of valine and isoleucine metabolism. Using analysis of acylcarnitine isomers, we show that 2-methylenecyclopropaneacetic acid (MCPA) inhibited SBCAD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, but not ACAD8. MCPA treatment of wild-type and PA HEK-293 cells caused a pronounced decrease in C3-carnitine. Furthermore, deletion of ACADSB in HEK-293 cells led to an equally strong decrease in C3-carnitine when compared to wild-type cells. Deletion of ECHS1 in HEK-293 cells caused a defect in lipoylation of the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which was not rescued by ACAD8 deletion. MCPA was able to rescue lipoylation in ECHS1 KO cells, but only in cells with prior ACAD8 deletion. SBCAD was not the sole ACAD responsible for this compensation, which indicates substantial promiscuity of ACADs in HEK-293 cells for the isobutyryl-CoA substrate. Substrate promiscuity appeared less prominent for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA at least in HEK-293 cells. We suggest that pharmacological inhibition of SBCAD to treat PA should be investigated further.",

    "abstract": "Icumazoles are potent antifungal polyketides with intriguing structural features. Here, we present the polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster of icumazoles. Surprisingly, an unusual non-terminal thioesterase domain divides the PKS/NRPS assembly line. The succeeding PKS modules potentially form a rare precursor 4-methyl-2-hexenoyl-ACP thus deviating from the previously proposed polyoxypeptin pathway. The 4-methyl-2-hexenoyl-ACP is further reductive carboxylated to 2-methylbutylmalonyl-ACP essential for icumazole biosynthesis by IcuL, representing a new type of crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (CCR). We characterize IcuL and its homologs TgaD and Leu10 in vitro, suggesting a stricter substrate specificity of this new family of CCRs than found in canonical ones. Intriguingly, we also find that TgaD unprecedently utilizes both NADPH and NADH as cofactors with similar efficiency, diverging from the NADPH-specific characteristic of canonical CCRs. Furthermore, a sequence similarity network-based bioinformatic survey reveals that the IcuL-like CCRs are evolutionarily separated from canonical CCRs.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease is characterised by CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene above a critical threshold of ~35 repeats, resulting in polyglutamine expansion of the huntingtin protein (HTT). The biological role of wildtype HTT and the associated mechanisms of disease pathology caused by expanded HTT remain incompletely understood, in part, due to challenges characterising interactions between HTT and putative binding partners. Here we describe a biochemical toolkit of rationally designed, high-quality recombinant HTT subdomains; one spanning the N-terminal HEAT and bridge domains (NTD) and the second spanning the C-terminal HEAT domain (CTD). Using biophysical methods and cryo-electron microscopy, we show these smaller subdomains are natively folded and can associate to reconstitute a functional full-length HTT structure capable of forming a near native-like complex with 40 kDa HTT-associated protein (HAP40). We report biotin-tagged variants of these subdomains, as well as full-length HTT, that permit immobilisation of each protein for quantitative biophysical assays without impacting protein quality. We demonstrate the CTD alone can form a stable complex when co-expressed with HAP40, which can be structurally resolved. The CTD-HAP40 complex binds the NTD, with a dissociation constant of approximately 10 nM as measured by bio-layer interferometry. We validate the interaction between the CTD and HAP40 using a luciferase two-hybrid assay and use subdomain constructs to demonstrate their respective stabilization of HAP40 in cells. These open-source biochemical tools will enable the wider HD community to study fundamental HTT biology, discover new macromolecular or small-molecule binding partners and map interaction sites across this very large protein.",

    "abstract": "AI-based methods such as AlphaFold have revolutionized structural biology, often making it possible to predict protein structures with high accuracy. The accuracies of these predictions vary, however, and they do not include ligands, covalent modifications or other environmental factors. Here we focus on very-high-confidence parts of AlphaFold predictions, evaluating how well they can be expected to describe the structure of a protein in a particular environment. We compare predictions with experimental crystallographic maps of the same proteins for 102 crystal structures. In many cases, those parts of AlphaFold predictions that were predicted with very high confidence matched experimental maps remarkably closely. In other cases, these predictions differed from experimental maps on a global scale through distortion and domain orientation, and on a local scale in backbone and side-chain conformation. Overall, C atoms in very-high-confidence parts of AlphaFold predictions differed from corresponding crystal structures by a median of 0.6 [A], and about 10% of these differed by more than 2 [A], each about twice the values found for pairs of crystal structures containing the same components but determined in different space groups. We suggest considering AlphaFold predictions as exceptionally useful hypotheses. We further suggest that it is important to consider the confidence in prediction when interpreting AlphaFold predictions and to carry out experimental structure determination to verify structural details, particularly those that involve interactions not included in the prediction.",

    "abstract": "O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an emerging post-translation modification that couples metabolism with cellular signal transduction by crosstalking with phosphorylation and ubiquitination to orchestrate various biological processes. Herein we show that it modifies the N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-mRNA reader YTHDF1 and fine-tunes its nuclear translocation by the exportin protein Crm1. First we present evidence that YTHDF1 interacts with the sole O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Second, we verified the YTHDF1 O-GlcNAcylation sites to be Ser196/Ser197/Ser198, as described in previous numerous chemoproteomic studies. Then we constructed the O-GlcNAc-deficient YTHDF1-S196AS197FS198A (AFA) mutants, which significantly attentuated O-GlcNAc signals. Moreover, we revealed that YTHDF1 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein, whose nuclear export is mediated by Crm1. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation increases the cytosolic portion of YTHDF1 by enhancing binding with Crm1, thus upregulating the downstream target (e.g. c-Myc) expression. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that O-GlcNAcylation at S197 might promote the binding between the nuclear export signal motif and Crm1 through increasing hydrogen bonding. Mouse xenograft assays further demonstrate that YTHDF1-AFA mutants decreased the colon cancer mass and size via decreasing c-Myc expression. In sum, we found that YTHDF1 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein, whose cytosolic localization is dependent on O-GlcNAc modification. We propose that the OGT-YTHDF1-c-Myc axis might underlie colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "High-intensity femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser enable pump probe experiments for investigating electronic and nuclear changes during light-induced reactions. On time scales ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds and for a variety of biological systems, time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) has provided detailed structural data for light-induced isomerization, breakage or formation of chemical bonds and electron transfer1. However, all ultra-fast TR-SFX studies to date have employed such high pump laser energies that several photons were nominally absorbed per chromophore2-14. As multiphoton absorption may force the protein response into nonphysiological pathways, it is of great concern15 whether this experimental approach16 allows valid inferences to be drawn vis-a-vis biologically relevant single-photon-induced reactions17. Here we describe ultrafast pump-probe SFX experiments on photodissociation of carboxymyoglobin, showing that different pump laser fluences yield markedly different results. In particular, the dynamics of structural changes and observed indicators of the mechanistically important coherent oscillations of the Fe-CO bond distance (predicted by recent quantum wavepacket dynamics15) are seen to depend strongly on pump laser energy. Our results confirm both the feasibility and necessity of performing TR-SFX pump probe experiments in the linear photoexcitation regime. We consider this to be a starting point for reassessing design and interpretation of ultrafast TR-SFX pump probe experiments16 such that biologically relevant insight emerges.",

This energy supply mechanism may play a key biophysical basis for explaining how the body efficiently obtain energy, because the quantized chemical reactions could have a high energy efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity compared with the traditional thermochemistry and photochemistry.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved an extensive specialized secondary metabolism. The colorful flavonoid anthocyanins, for example, not only stimulate flower pollination and seed dispersal but also protect different tissues against high light, UV- and oxidative stress. Their biosynthesis is highly regulated by environmental and developmental cues and induced by high sucrose levels. Expression of the biosynthetic enzymes involved is controlled by a transcriptional MBW complex, comprising (R2R3) MYB- and bHLH-type transcription factors (TF) and the WD40 repeat protein TTG1. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is obviously useful but also carbon- and energy-intensive and non-vital. Consistently, the SnRK1 protein kinase, a metabolic sensor activated in carbon- and energy-depleting stress conditions, represses anthocyanin biosynthesis. Here we show that Arabidopsis SnRK1 represses MBW complex activity both at the transcriptional and post-translational level. In addition to repressing expression of the key transcription factor MYB75/PAP1, SnRK1 activity triggers MBW complex dissociation, associated with loss of target promoter binding, MYB75 protein degradation and nuclear export of TTG1. We also provide evidence for direct interaction with and phosphorylation of multiple MBW complex proteins. These results indicate that repression of expensive anthocyanin biosynthesis is an important strategy to save energy and redirect carbon flow to more essential processes for survival in metabolic stress conditions.",

Involved in a two-substrate sequential reaction, amino acids with increased concentration could elevate the reduced aminoacylation rate caused by specific tRNA modification. Here, we developed a selection system for overproducers of specific amino acids using corresponding engineered tRNAs and reporter genes. As a proof-of-concept, overproducers of five amino acids such as L-tryptophan were screened out by growth-based and/or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based screening from random mutation libraries of Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. This study provided a universal strategy that could be applied to screen overproducers of proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids in amber-stop-codon-recoded or non-recoded hosts.",

Although nerve injury is known to cause transcriptional dysregulation, how this differs across neuronal subtypes and the impact of sex is unclear. Here, we study the deep transcriptional profiles of multiple murine DRG populations in early and late pain states while considering sex. We have exploited currently available transgenics to label numerous subpopulations for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and subsequent transcriptomic analysis. Using bulk tissue samples, we are able to circumvent the issues of low transcript coverage and drop-outs seen with single cell datasets. This increases our power to detect novel and even subtle changes in gene expression within neuronal subtypes and discuss sexual dimorphism at the neuronal subtype level. We have curated this resource into an accessible database for other researchers (https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/). We see both stereotyped and unique subtype signatures in injured states after nerve injury at both an early and late timepoint. While all populations contribute to a general injury signature, subtype enrichment changes can also be seen. Within populations, there is not a strong intersection of sex and injury, but previously unknown sex differences in naive states-particularly in A{beta}-RA + A{delta}-LTMRs - still contribute to differences in injured neurons.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a range of liver conditions ranging from excess fat accumulation to liver failure. NAFLD is strongly associated with high-fat diet (HFD) consumption that constitutes a metabolic risk factor. While HFD has been elucidated concerning its several systemic effects, there is little information about its influence on the brain at the molecular level. Here, by using a high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding of adult zebrafish, we first reveal that excess fat uptake results in weight gain and fatty liver. Prolonged exposure to HFD induces a significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation markers in the liver and brain tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses of the brain tissues disclose stimulation of apoptosis and widespread activation of glial cell response. Moreover, glial activation is accompanied by an initial decrease in the number of neurons and their subsequent replacement in the olfactory bulb and the telencephalon. Long-term consumption of HFD causes activation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in the brain tissues. Finally, fish fed an HFD induces anxiety, and aggressiveness and increases locomotor activity. Thus, HFD feeding leads to a non-traumatic brain injury and stimulates a regenerative response. The activation mechanisms of a regeneration response in the brain can be exploited to fight obesity and recover from non-traumatic injuries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTherapeutic options for patients with prolonged disorder of consciousness (PDOC) are limited. PDOC patients often exhibit a dissociation between their retained level of (covert) cognitive ability and their (overt) behavioural responses (cognitive-motor dissociation; CMD). This is linked to reduced coupling between thalamus and the primary motor cortex.\n\nObjectiveTo assess whether pairing tDCS with a concurrent passive mobilisation protocol (designed to be feasible in PDOC) can influence thalamo-M1 dynamics and whether these changes are enhanced after multiple stimulation sessions.\n\nMethodsWe used Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 22 healthy participants to assess tDCS changes on effective connectivity within motor network areas during command-following.\n\nResultsWe found that a single anodal tDCS session (paired with passive mobilisation of the thumb) decreased self-inhibition in the motor cortex, with five sessions further enhancing this effect. In addition, anodal tDCS increased thalamo-M1 excitation as compared to cathodal stimulation, with the effects maintained after 5 sessions. In turn, cathodal tDCS had opposing effects on these connections after one session but became more similar to anodal after 5.\n\nConclusionsTogether, our results suggest that pairing anodal tDCS with passive mobilisation across multiple sessions may facilitate behavioural command-following in PDOC patients with CMD. More broadly, they offer a mechanistic window into the neural underpinnings of the cumulative effects of multi-session tDCS.",

    "abstract": "Patients with neurocognitive disorders often battle sleep disturbances. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a tryptophan metabolite of the kynurenine pathway implicated in the pathology of these illnesses. Modest increases in KYNA, an antagonist at glutamatergic and cholinergic receptors, result in cognitive impairments and sleep dysfunction. We explored the hypothesis that inhibition of the KYNA synthesizing enzyme, kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), may alleviate sleep disturbances. At the start of the light phase, adult male and female Wistar rats received systemic injections of either i) vehicle, ii) kynurenine (100mg/kg; i.p.), iii) the KAT II inhibitor, PF-04859989 (30 mg/kg; s.c.), or iv) PF-04859989 and kynurenine in combination. Kynurenine and KYNA levels were evaluated in the plasma and brain. Separate animals were implanted with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) telemetry devices to record polysomnography and evaluate vigilance states wake, rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REM sleep (NREMS) following each treatment. Kynurenine challenge increased brain KYNA and resulted in reduced REMS duration, NREMS delta power and sleep spindles. PF-04859989 reduced brain KYNA formation when given prior to kynurenine, prevented disturbances in REM sleep and sleep spindles, and enhanced NREM sleep. Our findings suggest that reducing KYNA in conditions where the kynurenine pathway is activated may serve as a potential strategy for improving sleep dynamics.",

We show here that haptoglobin, a major serum pro-tein with elusive immunoregulatory properties, binds and buffers serum-borne bacterial lipopolysaccharides to attenuate activation of NF{kappa}B in macrophages. Haptoglobin binds different lipopolysaccharides with low micromolar affinities. Given its abundance, haptoglobin constitutes a buffer for lipopolysaccharides, shielding them to safeguard against aberrant inflammatory reactions caused by small fluctuations. Concordantly, NF{kappa}B activation by haptoglobin-associated lipopolysaccharides was delayed relative to stimulation with pure lipopolysaccharide. Our findings warrant evaluation of therapeutic benefits of haptoglobin for inflammatory conditions and re-evaluation of purification strategies. Finally, they allow to elucidate mechanisms of enhanced immunosuppression by oncofetal haptoglobin.",

    "abstract": "Pantoea ananatis is an unusual bacterial pathogen that lacks typical virulence determinants yet causes extensive necrosis in onion foliage and bulb tissues. The onion necrosis phenotype is dependent on the expression of a phosphonate toxin, pantaphos that is catalyzed by putative enzymes encoded by the HiVir gene cluster. The genetic contributions of individual hvr genes in HiVir-mediated onion necrosis remain largely unknown except for the first gene hvrA (phosphoenolpyruvate mutase, pepM) whose deletion resulted in the loss of onion pathogenicity. In this study, using gene deletion mutation and complementation, we report that of the ten remaining genes, hvrB-hvrF are also strictly required for the HiVir-mediated onion necrosis and in planta bacterial growth whereas hvrG-hvrJ partially contributed to these phenotypes. As the HiVir gene cluster is a common genetic feature shared among the onion-pathogenic P. ananatis strains, and as it could serve as a useful diagnostic marker of onion pathogenicity, we sought to understand the genetic basis of HiVir positive yet phenotypically deviant (non-pathogenic) strains. We identified and genetically characterized inactivating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in essential hvr genes of six phenotypically deviant P. ananatis strains. Finally, inoculation of the cell-free spent medium of Ptac-driven HiVir strain caused P. ananatis-characteristic red onion scale necrosis (RSN) as well as cell death symptoms in tobacco. The co-inoculation of the spent medium with essential hvr mutant strains restored strains in planta populations to the wild-type level, suggesting that necrosis is important for proliferation of P. ananatis in onion tissue.",

    "abstract": "Within human microbiomes, Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Saccharibacteria, members of Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), are increasingly correlated with human oral health and disease. We profiled the diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems in the genomes of these bacteria and sought phages that are capable of infecting them by comparing their spacer inventories to large phage sequence databases. Gracilibacteria and Absconditabacteria recode the typical TGA stop codon to glycine and are infected by phages that share their hosts alternate genetic code. Unexpectedly, however, other predicted phages of Gracilibacteria and Absconditabacteria do not use an alternative genetic code. Some of these phages are predicted to infect both alternatively coded CPR bacteria and standard coded bacteria. These phages rely on other stop codons besides TGA, and thus should be capable of producing viable gene products in either bacterial host type. Interestingly, we predict that phages of Saccharibacteria can replicate in Actinobacteria, which have been shown to act as episymbiotic hosts for Saccharibacteria. Overall, the broad host range of some CPR phages may be advantageous for the production of these phages for microscopic characterization or use as therapy agents, given the current difficulty of CPR cultivation. Absconditabacteria phages and Gracilibacteria phages may have avoided acquisition of in-frame stop codons to increase the diversity of bacteria in which they can replicate.",

Genome-wide insertion sequencing, luminescence-based attachment assays and proteomic analysis demonstrate primary attachment of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 to Pisum sativum (pea) roots is more complex than previously thought. In total, 115 proteins are needed for initial attachment under one or more test conditions (acid, neutral or alkaline pH), with 22 required under all conditions. These include cell-surface filamentous hemagglutinin adhesin (RL4382) and its transporter (RL4381), transmembrane protein RL2400, RL3752 (PssA, glycosyl transferase) affecting capsular polysaccharide and transcriptional regulator RL4145 (PckR). RNASeq was used to determine targets of RL4145 (PckR) and regulator RL3453. The 54 proteins required for attachment at pH 7.0 were investigated for nodulation phenotypes. Glucomannan biosynthesis protein A (GmsA) is needed at pH 6.5 and pH 7.0. Membrane proteins DgkA and ImpA are required specifically at pH 6.5, and RpoZ at pH 7.5. Sonicated cell surface fractions inhibited root attachment at alkaline pH but no overlap between proteins identified by proteomic and INseq analysis, suggests there is no single rhicadhesin needed for alkaline attachment.

Using DoTA-seq, we elucidate the highly diverse single cell ON/OFF states of the phase-variable capsule synthesis operons in the prevalent human gut species Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, we quantify the shifts in antibiotic resistance gene abundances in different species in a 25 member human gut microbial community in response to antibiotics. By sequencing tens of thousands of single-cells derived from a human fecal sample, we identify links between plasmid replicons and the taxonomic lineages of their associated hosts.

    "abstract": "A haploid of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe expresses either the P or M matingtype, determined by the active, euchromatic, mat1 cassette. Mating-type is switched by Rad51-driven gene conversion of mat1 using a heterochromatic donor cassette, mat2-P or mat3-M. The Swi2-Swi5 complex, a mating-type switching factor, is central to this process by designating a preferred donor in a cell-type-specific manner. Swi2-Swi5 selectively enables one of two cisacting recombination enhancers, SRE2 adjacent to mat2-P or SRE3 adjacent to mat3-M. Here, we identified two functionally important motifs in Swi2, a Swi6 (HP1 homolog)-binding site and two DNA-binding AT-hooks. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the AT-hooks were required for Swi2 localization at SRE3 to select the mat3-M donor in P cells, while the Swi6-binding site was required for Swi2 localization at SRE2 to select mat2-P in M cells. In addition, the Swi2-Swi5 complex promoted Rad51-driven strand exchange in vitro. Taken together, our results show how the Swi2-Swi5 complex would localize to recombination enhancers through a cell-type specific binding mechanism and stimulate Rad51-driven gene conversion at the localization site.",

Machine learning approaches to drug combination response prediction can prioritize experiments and discover new combinations, but require lots of training data in order to fit the nonlinearity of synergistic effect. Here, we propose Pisces, a novel machine learning approach for drug combination synergy prediction. The key idea of Pisces is to augment the sparse drug combination dataset by creating multiple views for each drug combination based on its different modalities. We combined eight different modalities of a single drug to create 64 augmented views for a pair of drugs, effectively expanding the size of the original data 64 times. Pisces obtained state-of-the-art results on cell-line-based drug synergy prediction, xenograft-based drug synergy prediction, and drug-drug interaction prediction. By interpreting Piscess predictions using a genetic interaction network, we further identified a breast cancer drug-sensitive pathway from BRCA cell lines in GDSC. We validated this pathway on an independent TCGA-BRCA tumor dataset and found that patients with this pathway activated had substantially longer survival time. Collectively, Pisces effectively predicts drug synergy and drug-drug interactions through augmenting the original dataset 64 times, and can be broadly applied to various biological applications that involve a pair of drugs.",

This small genome is crucial for proper functioning of mitochondria, the energy-converting organelles. In mammals, mtDNA is arranged into macromolecular complexes called nucleoids that serve as functional stations for its maintenance and expression. Here, we aimed to explore an uncharacterized protein c17orf80, which was previously detected close to the nucleoid components by proximity-labelling mass spectrometry. To investigate the subcellular localization and function of c17orf80, we took an advantage of immunofluorescence microscopy, interaction proteomics and several biochemical assays. We demonstrate that c17orf80 is a mitochondrial membrane-associated protein that interacts with nucleoids even when mtDNA replication is inhibited. In addition, we show that c17orf80 is not essential for mtDNA maintenance and mitochondrial gene expression in cultured human cells. These results provide a basis for uncovering the molecular function of c17orf80 and the nature of its association with nucleoids, possibly leading to new insights about mtDNA and its expression.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput genotyping enables the large-scale analysis of genetic diversity in population genomics and genomewide association studies that combine the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of large collections of accessions. Sequencing-based approaches for genotyping are progressively replacing traditional genotyping methods due to the lower ascertainment bias. However, genome-wide genotyping based on sequencing becomes expensive in species with large genomes and a high proportion of repetitive DNA. Here we describe the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete repetitive elements in the 3.76-Gb genome of lentil (Lens culinaris), 84% consisting of repeats, thus concentrating the sequencing data on coding and regulatory regions (single-copy regions). We designed a custom set of 566,766 gRNAs targeting 2.9 Gbp of repeats and excluding repetitive regions overlapping annotated genes and putative regulatory elements based on ATAC-Seq data. The novel depletion method removed [~]40% of reads mapping to repeats, increasing those mapping to single-copy regions by [~]2.6-fold. When analyzing 25 million fragments, this repeat-to-single-copy shift in the sequencing data increased the number of genotyped bases of [~]10-fold compared to non-depleted libraries. In the same condition, we were also able to identify [~]12-fold more genetic variants in the single-copy regions and increased the genotyping accuracy by rescuing thousands of heterozygous variants that otherwise would be missed due to low coverage. The method performed similarly regardless of the multiplexing level, type of library or genotypes, including different cultivars and a closely-related species (L. orientalis). Our results demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-driven repeat depletion focuses sequencing data on meaningful genomic regions, thus improving high-density and genome-wide genotyping in large and repetitive genomes.",

    "abstract": "While altered protein glycosylation is regarded a trait of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), its heterogeneous glycoproteome and dynamics with disease progression remain unmapped. To this end, we here employ an integrated multi-omics approach comprising unbiased and quantitative glycomics and glycoproteomics applied to a valuable cohort of resected tumour tissues from OSCC patients with (n = 19) and without (n = 12) lymph node metastasis. While all tumour tissues displayed uniform N-glycome profiles suggesting relatively stable global N-glycosylation during lymph node metastasis, glycoproteomics and advanced correlation analysis notably uncovered altered site-specific N-glycosylation and previously unknown associations with several key clinicopathological features. Importantly, focused analyses of the multi-omics data unveiled two N-glycans and three N-glycopeptides that were closely associated with patient survival. This study provides novel insight into the complex OSCC tissue N-glycoproteome forming an important resource to further explore the underpinning disease mechanisms and uncover new prognostic glyco-markers for OSCC.\n\nTeaserDeep survey of the dynamic landscape of complex sugars in oral tumours paves a way for new prognostic disease markers.",

    "abstract": "Parturition is the final step of mammalian reproduction and an essential process for the species survival. During pregnancy, the uterus is maintained quiescence which is important for fetal growth and development. However, at term, fundamental changes in myometrial contractility are initiated for efficient expulsion of the fetus. These changes involve tissue remodeling that requires changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The gelatinases subgroup of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), has only two members: MMP2 and MMP9, which are both known to participate in uterine ECM remodeling throughout the estrus cycle as well as during pregnancy, parturition and postpartum involution. Yet, no knowledge exists regarding their loss-of-function impact on the uterus. Here we investigated the effect of MMP2 and/or MMP9 genetic loss on parturition process. Single and double knockout (dKO) mice for MMP2 and/or MMP9 were used. We found high percentages of dystocia in mmp2-/-, mmp2-/-mmp9+/- and dKO females, but not in mmp9-/- females. Histological analysis of nulliparous uterine tissue of WT, mmp2-/-, mmp9-/- and dKO, at 8 weeks, 4 months and 8-9.5 months, revealed that the uterine tissue of mmp2-/- presents alterations in tissue size and structure, mainly when reaching to 8-9.5 months of age, including enlarged total tissue, myometrium, endometrium and luminal cavity. Additionally, Massons Trichrome staining suggested a mechanism of extensive fibrosis in mmp2-/- myometrium, which may lead to dystocia. Altogether, our research highlights a novel cause for dystocia pathology mediated by loss of MMP2 activity in uterine tissue during mammalian parturition.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional terminators are key players in the flow of genetic information, but are often overlooked in circuit design. In this work, we used the Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA) as a scaffold to investigate the effects of different terminators in the output of a reporter construct expressed in two bacterial species and found that replacing the conventional T1 and T0 transcriptional terminators of the SEVA vector format with a set of broad-host metagenomic terminators resulted in a significant improvement in the signal of a fluorescent device in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Interestingly, this new vector design displayed the same performance as pSEVA231 in Escherichia coli DH10B. Our results support the notion that transcriptional terminators may affect the interconnected mesh of biological processes taking place in gene expression, leading to a host-dependent output that should be heeded for optimal circuit expression in different microbial hosts.",

    "abstract": "The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is the most common RNA-binding protein domain identified in nature. However, RRM-containing proteins are only prevalent in eukaryotic phyla, in which they play central regulatory roles. Here, we engineered an orthogonal post-transcriptional control system of gene expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli with the mammalian RNA-binding protein Musashi-1, which is a stem cell marker with neurodevelopmental role that contains two canonical RRMs. In the circuit, Musashi-1 is regulated transcriptionally and works as an allosteric translation repressor thanks to a specific interaction with the N-terminal coding region of a messenger RNA and its structural plasticity to respond to fatty acids. We fully characterized the genetic system at the population and single-cell levels showing a significant fold change in reporter expression, and the underlying molecular mechanism by assessing the in vitro binding kinetics and in vivo functionality of a series of RNA mutants. The dynamic response of the system was well recapitulated by a bottom-up mathematical model. Moreover, we applied the post-transcriptional mechanism engineered with Musashi-1 to specifically regulate a gene within an operon, to implement combinatorial regulation, and to reduce protein expression noise. This work illustrates how RRM-based regulation can be adapted to simple organisms, thereby adding a new regulatory layer in prokaryotes for translation control.",

    "abstract": "The use of prior knowledge to guide perception is fundamental to human vision, especially under challenging viewing circumstances. Underpinning current theories of predictive coding, prior knowledge delivered to early sensory areas via cortical feedback connections can reshape perception of ambiguous stimuli, such as  two-tone images. Despite extensive interest and ongoing research into this process of perceptual reorganisation in the adult brain, it is not yet fully understood how or when the efficient use of prior knowledge for visual perception develops. Here we show for the first time that adult-like levels of perceptual reorganisation do not emerge until late childhood. We used a behavioural two-tone paradigm to isolate the effects of prior knowledge on visual perception in children aged 4 - 12 years and adults, and found a clear developmental progression in the perceptual benefit gained from informative cues. Whilst photo cueing reliably triggered perceptual reorganisation of two-tones for adults, 4- to 9-year-olds performed significantly poorer immediately after cueing than within-subject benchmarks of recognition. Young childens behaviour revealed perceptual biases towards local image features, as has been seen in image classification neural networks. We tested three such models (AlexNet, CorNet and NASNet) on two-tone classification, and while we found that network depth and recurrence may improve recognition, the best-performing network behaved similarly to young children. Our results reveal a prolonged development of prior-knowledge-guided vision throughout childhood, a process which may be central to other perceptual abilities that continue developing throughout childhood. This highlights the importance of effective reconciliation of signal and prediction for robust perception in both human and computational vision systems.",

    "abstract": "Viruses with large double-stranded DNA genomes appear to have captured the majority of their genes from the hosts at different stages of evolution. The origin of many virus genes is readily detected through highly significant sequence similarity with cellular homologs. This is the case, in particular, for virus enzymes, such as DNA and RNA polymerases or nucleotide kinases, that retain their catalytic activity after capture by an ancestral virus. However, a large fraction of virus genes have no readily detectable cellular homologs so that their origin remains enigmatic. We sought to explore potential origins of proteins of unknown provenance encoded in the genomes of orthopoxviruses, a thoroughly studied virus genus which includes major human pathogens. To this end, we used AlphaFold2, to predict the structures of all 214 proteins encoded by orthopoxviruses. Among the proteins of unknown provenance, structure prediction yielded a clear indication of origin for 14, along with validating several inferences previously made by sequence analysis. The major trend that emerges from these findings is the exaptation of enzymes from cellular organisms for non-enzymatic, structural roles in virus reproduction which is accompanied by disruption of catalytic sites and overall drastic divergence which precludes detection of homology at the sequence level. Among the 16 orthopoxvirus proteins found to be inactivated enzyme derivatives, are the poxvirus replication processivity factor A20, an inactivated derivative of bacterial NAD-dependent DNA ligase; major core protein A3, an inactivated deubiquitinase; F11, an inactivated prolyl hydroxylase; and more similar cases. However, for nearly one third of the orthopoxvirus virion proteins, no significantly similar structures were identified, suggesting exaptation with subsequent major structural rearrangement, yielding novel protein folds.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial gene expression is highly regulated to allow cells to grow and adapt. Much regulation occurs during transcription elongation, where RNA polymerase (RNAP) extends nascent RNA transcripts aided by global and universally-conserved elongation factor NusG. NusG modulates transcription by inhibiting pausing and backtracking; promoting anti-termination on ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons; coupling transcription with translation on mRNA genes; and stimulating Rho-dependent termination on toxic genes. Despite extensive work on NusG, its functional allocation and spatial distribution in vivo is unknown. Here, we addressed these long-standing questions using single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging of NusG in live E. coli cells. We found that, under conditions of moderate growth, NusG is mainly present as a population that associates indirectly with the chromosome via RNAP in transcription elongation complexes, and a slowly diffusing population we identified as a NusG complex with the 30S ribosomal subunit; this complex offers a \"30S-guided\" path for NusG to enter transcription elongation. Only ~10% of total NusG was fast-diffusing, with the mobility of this population suggesting that free NusG interacts non-specifically with DNA for >50% of the time. Using antibiotics and deletion mutants, we showed that most chromosome-associated NusG is involved in rrn anti-termination and in transcriptiontranslation coupling. NusG involvement in rrn anti-termination was mediated via its participation in phase-separated transcriptional condensates. Our work illuminates the diverse activities of a central regulator while offering a guide on how to dissect the roles of multi-functional machines using in vivo imaging.",

    "abstract": "The Notch signaling pathway is a cell-cell communication system with fundamental roles in embryonic development and the nervous system. The model of Notch receptor activation that is currently most accepted, involves a force-induced conformation change at the negative regulatory region of the receptor, the subsequent recruitment of ADAM metalloproteases and a cleavage cascade that releases the Notch intracellular domain. Here, we define conditions that enable force-independent Notch activation through the formation of soluble, long-lived, multivalent ligand-receptor complexes. To investigate how ligand valency affects activation of Notch receptors, we treated iPSc-derived neuroepithelial stem-like (lt-NES) cells with different spatially defined, molecularly precise ligand nanopatterns on DNA origami nanostructures. Our data indicate that Notch signaling is activated via stimulation with multivalent clusters of the ligand Jag1, and even multivalent chimeric structures where some Jag1 proteins are replaced by other binders that do not target Notch. The findings are corroborated by systematic elimination, through experimental control, of several confounding factors that potentially could generate forces, including electrostatic interactions, endocytosis and non-specific binding. Taken together, our data suggest a model where Jag1 ligands are able to activate Notch receptors upon prolonged binding, which subsequently triggers downstream signaling in a force independent manner. These findings reveal a distinct mode of activation of Notch and could lay the foundation for the development of soluble Notch agonists that currently remain elusive.",

    "abstract": "Previously we showed that the nuclear import receptor Importin-9 wraps around the H2A-H2B core to chaperone and transport it from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. However, unlike most nuclear import systems where RanGTP dissociates cargoes from their importins, RanGTP binds stably to the Importin-9*H2A-H2B complex and formation of the ternary RanGTP*Importin-9*H2A-H2B complex facilitates H2A-H2B release to the assembling nucleosome. It was unclear how RanGTP and the cargo H2A-H2B can bind simultaneously to an importin, and how interactions of the three components position H2A-H2B for nucleosome assembly. Here we show cryo-EM structures of Importin-9*RanGTP and of its yeast homolog Kap114, including Kap114*RanGTP, Kap114*H2A-H2B, and RanGTP*Kap114*H2A-H2B to explain how the conserved Kap114 binds H2A-H2B and RanGTP simultaneously and how the GTPase primes histone transfer to the nucleosome. In the ternary complex, RanGTP binds to the N-terminal repeats of Kap114 in the same manner as in the Kap114/Importin-9*RanGTP complex, and H2A-H2B binds via its acidic patch to the Kap114 C-terminal repeats much like in the Kap114/Importin-9*H2A-H2B complex. Ran binds to a different conformation of Kap114 in the ternary RanGTP*Kap114*H2A-H2B complex. Here, Kap114 no longer contacts the H2A-H2B surface proximal to the H2A docking domain that drives nucleosome assembly, positioning it for transfer to the assembling nucleosome.\n\nSignificance StatementHistones and their chaperone networks are typically conserved in eukaryotes. The yeast importin Kap114 and its human homolog Importin-9 share low sequence identity, but both are primary nuclear import receptors for the core histone heterodimer H2A-H2B. Cryo-EM structures of Kap114*H2A-H2B, Kap114*RanGTP and Importin-9*RanGTP complexes show homologous structure and function for Kap114 and Importin-9. In the nucleus, RanGTP binding to Kap114/Imp9*H2A-H2B does not release H2A-H2B, but RanGTP binds to form an atypical ternary complex. Structure of the ternary RanGTP*Kap114*H2A-H2B complex explains how the GTPase and cargo bind simultaneously to Kap114 and how the presence of Ran in the complex primes H2A-H2B transfer to assembling nucleosomes.",
