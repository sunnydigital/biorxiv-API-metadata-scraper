    "abstract": "This article develops mathematical theory for the population dynamics of microbiomes with their hosts and for holobiont evolution caused by holobiont selection. The objective is to account for the formation of microbiome-host integration.\n\nMicrobial population-dynamic parameters must mesh with the hosts for coexistence.\n\nA horizontally transmitted microbiome is a genetic system with \"collective inheritance\". The microbial source pool in the environment corresponds to the gamete pool for nuclear genes. Poisson sampling of the microbial source pool corresponds to binomial sampling of the gamete pool. However, holobiont selection on the microbiome does not lead to a counterpart of the Hardy-Weinberg Law nor to directional selection that always fixes microbial genes conferring the highest holobiont fitness.\n\nA microbe might strike an optimal fitness balance between lowering its within-host fitness while increasing holobiont fitness. Such microbes are replaced by otherwise identical microbes that contribute nothing to holobiont fitness. This replacement can be reversed by hosts that initiate immune responses to non-helpful microbes. This discrimination leads to microbial species sorting. Host-orchestrated species sorting (HOSS) followed by microbial competition, rather than co-evolution or multi-level selection, is predicted to be the cause of microbiome-host integration.",

    "abstract": "Cold stress is a critical environmental challenge that affects an organisms fitness-related traits. In Drosophila, increased resistance to specific environmental stress may lead to increased resistance to other kinds of stress. In the present study, we aimed to understand whether increased cold stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster can facilitate their ability to tolerate other environmental stresses. For the current study, we used successfully selected replicate populations of D. melanogaster against cold shock and their control population. These selected populations have evolved several reproductive traits, including increased egg viability, mating frequency, male mating ability, ability to sire progenies, and faster recovery for mating latency under cold shock conditions. In the present work, we investigated egg viability and mating frequency with and without heat and cold shock conditions in the selected and their control populations. We also examined resistance to cold shock, heat shock, desiccation, starvation, and survival post-challenge with Staphylococcus succinus subsp. succinus PK-1 in the selected and their control populations.\n\nAfter cold-shock treatment, we found a 1.25 times increase in egg viability and a 1.57 times increase in mating frequency in the selected populations compared to control populations. Moreover, more males (0.87 times) and females (1.66 times) of the selected populations survived under cold shock conditions relative to their controls. After being subjected to heat shock, the selected populations egg viability and mating frequency increased by 0.30 times and 0.57 times, respectively, compared to control populations. Additionally, more selected males (0.31 times) and females (0.98 times) survived under heat shock conditions compared to the control populations. Desiccation resistance slightly increased in the females of the selected populations relative to their control, but we observed no change in the case of males. Starvation resistance decreased in males and females of the selected populations compared to their controls.\n\nOur findings suggest that the increased resistance to cold shock correlates with increased tolerance to heat stress, but this evolved resistance comes at a cost, with decreased tolerance to starvation.",

We use an oxygen-constrained, game-theoretic food-web model to simulate diel vertical migrations and estimate global carbon fluxes and sequestration by fish and zooplankton due to respiration, fecal pellets, and deadfalls. Our model provides estimates of the carbon export and sequestration potential for a range of pelagic functional groups, despite uncertain biomass estimates of some functional groups. While the export production of metazoans and fish is modest (~20% of global total), we estimate that their contribution to carbon sequestered by the biological pump (~ 800 PgC) is conservatively more than 50% of the estimated global total (~1300 PgC) and have a significantly longer sequestration time scale (~250 years) than previously reported for other components of the biological pump. Fish and multicellular zooplankton contribute about equally to this sequestered carbon pool. This essential ecosystem service could be at risk from both unregulated fishing on the high seas and ocean deoxygenation due to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by a deterioration in the regenerative and repair potential of stem cell niches in the brain1-5. However, the mechanisms underlying this decline are largely unknown. Here we characterize genome-wide chromatin accessibility in young and old neurogenic niche cells in vivo, revealing defects in neural stem cell (NSC) adhesion and migration during aging. Interestingly, chromatin accessibility at cell adhesion and migration genes decreases with age in quiescent NSCs but increases with age in activated (proliferative) NSCs, and this is accompanied by corresponding expression changes in these genes. We experimentally validate that quiescent and activated NSCs exhibit opposing adhesion and migration behaviors with age: quiescent NSCs become less adhesive (and more migratory) whereas activated NSCs and progeny become more adhesive (and less migratory) during aging. We also show that the ability of activated NSCs and progeny to mobilize out of the niche during in vivo neurogenesis diminishes during aging. Using tension sensors with single molecule resolution, we find that one of the cellular mechanisms by which aging impairs the migration of old activated NSCs and progeny involves increased force-producing adhesions. We identify inhibition of the cytoskeletal-regulating kinase ROCK6, 7 as a way to reduce force-producing adhesions and restore migration in old activated NSCs in vitro. Interestingly, inhibition of ROCK in the neurogenic niche of old mice boosts neurogenesis to the olfactory bulb in vivo. These results have important implications for restoring the migratory potential of NSCs and progeny and for improving neurogenesis in the aged brain.",

Furthermore, the variations, relationships, and potential drivers of sex differentiation in providing care across different care stages remain largely unknown. Here, we surveyed species in birds and uncovered remarkable differences in the sex role patterns across different care forms. This result implied that parental care should not be treated as a unitary trait but as a composite of integrated features with great variations. Further analyses revealed moderate correlations of the sex roles between care forms, indicating the existence of shared intrinsic drivers. We tested the effects of sexual selection, certainty of paternity, predation risk, and offsprings life history traits in driving sex role variations. Results showed that species with strong sexual selection on males or uncertainty of paternity tend to have female-biased care.",

    "abstract": "Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has dramatically expanded in primates, but its organization and interactions with other brain regions are only partially understood. We performed high-resolution connectomic mapping of marmoset PFC and found two contrasting corticocortical and corticostriatal projection patterns: \"patchy\" projections that formed many columns of submillimeter scale in nearby and distant regions and \"diffuse\" projections that spread widely across the cortex and striatum. Parcellation-free analyses revealed representations of PFC gradients in these projections local and global distribution patterns. We also demonstrated column-scale precision of reciprocal cortico-cortical connectivity, suggesting that PFC contains a mosaic of discrete columns. Diffuse projections showed considerable diversity in the laminar patterns of axonal spread. In mice, columnar projections were much less conspicuous, underscoring the importance of the primate model. Altogether, these fine-grained analyses reveal important principles of local and long-distance PFC circuits in marmosets and provide insights into the functional organization of the primate brain.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying fitness is important to understand adaptive evolution. Reproductive values are useful for making fitness comparisons involving different categories of individuals, like males and females. By definition, the reproductive value of a category is the expected per capita contribution of the members of that category to the gene pool of future generations. Life history theory reveals how reproductive values can be determined via the estimation of life-history parameters, but this requires intricate algebraic calculations. Recently, a more intuitive, pedigree-based method has become popular, which estimates the genetic contributions of individuals to future generations by tracking their descendants down the pedigree. Here we compare both methods. We implement various life-history scenarios (for which the \"true\" reproductive values can be calculated) in individual-based simulations, use the simulation data to estimate reproductive values with both methods, and compare the results with the true target values. We show that the pedigree-based estimation of reproductive values is either systematically biased (and hence inaccurate), or very imprecise. This holds even for simple life histories and under idealized conditions. In contrast, the traditional algebraic method estimates reproductive values with high accuracy and precision.\n\nLay SummaryTo study evolution in empirical systems it is important to accurately and precisely measure fitness. Here, using simulations, we compare two methods for estimating fitness and test their accuracy and precision. One estimates life-history parameters and calculates a fitness proxy using complex algebra. The other method estimates genetic contribution to future generations by tracking descendants down the pedigree. We conclude that the pedigree method is unreliable, while the algebraic method is accurate and precise.",

Additionally, this axis is thought to guide signal propagation and integration across the cortical hierarchy. While human neuroimaging work has shown that this axis constrains local properties of the human connectome, it remains unclear whether it also shapes the asymmetric signaling that arises from higher-order connectome topology. Here, we used network control theory to examine the amount of energy required to propagate dynamics across the sensory-fugal axis. Our results revealed an asymmetry in this energy indicating that bottom-up transitions were easier to complete compared to top-down transitions. Supporting analyses demonstrated that this asymmetry was underpinned by a connectome topology that is wired to support efficient bottom-up signaling. Finally, we found that this asymmetry correlated with changes in intrinsic neuronal timescales and lessened throughout youth. Our results show that cortical variation in cytoarchitecture may guide the formation of macroscopic connectome topology.",

The understanding of phenotype-genotype relationships, the identification of driver genes and various proof-of-concepts for therapeutics have benefited from mouse models. The premier model, named Ts(1716)65Dn/J (Ts65Dn), displayed phenotypes related to the human DS features. It carries an additional minichromosome with the Mir155 to Zbtb21 region of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16), homologous to Hsa21, encompassing around 90 genes, fused to the centromeric part of mouse chromosome 17 (Mmu17) fromPisd-ps2/Scaf8 to Pde10a, containing 46 genes, not related to Hsa21. Here, we report the investigation of a new model, Ts66Yah, generated by CrispR/Cas9 without the genomic region unrelated to Hsa21 on the minichromosome. As expected, Ts66Yah replicated DS cognitive features. However, certain phenotypes related to increased activity, spatial learning and molecular signatures, were changed suggesting genetic interactions between the Mir155-Zbtb21 and the Scaf8-Pde10a interval. Thus, Ts66Yah mice have a stronger construct and face validity for mimicking consequences of DS genetic overdosage.

Here, we demonstrate that membrane curvature serves as a key regulator of the spatial distribution of Piezo1 in the plasma membrane of living cells. Piezo1 depletes from highly curved membrane protrusions such as filopodia and enriches to nanoscale membrane invaginations. Quantification of the curvaturedependent sorting of Piezo1 directly reveals the in situ nano-geometry of the Piezo1-membrane complex. Piezo1 density on filopodia increases upon activation, independent of Ca2+, suggesting flattening of the channel upon opening. Consequently, the expression of Piezo1 inhibits filopodia formation, an effect that diminishes with channel activation.",

We characterise functional integrity by the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of (semi-)natural habitat within any landscape.

    "abstract": "Highly acidic, D/E-rich peptides or proteins are difficult to identify by positive-ion-mode mass spectrometry (MS), and negative-ion-mode MS is an attractive but insufficiently explored alternative. Based on high-resolution and accurate-mass MS analysis of 115 synthetic peptides of 5-28 amino acids, we confirmed that higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) of deprotonated peptides induced abundant backbone or side-chain neutral losses (NL), and updated the ranking list of NLs by abundance. The most abundant fragment ion types are y- > x-, z- > c- if the NL ions are included, or c- > y- > z- > b- if not. The most frequent side-chain NLs involve amino acids C, S, T, D, E, N, Q, and R. Although NL of CO2 is common for all peptides, it is markedly enhanced in D/E-containing peptides. Long peptides and D/E-rich peptides are prone to carrying multiple negative charges. HCD spectra produced from multiply deprotonated peptides have a lower fraction of sequencing ions (i.e., a-, b-, c-, x-, y-, z- ions) than those produced from 1- ([M-H]-) and 2- ([M-2H]2-) precursors. Based on the above findings, we predict that under negative-ion HCD, D/E-rich peptides should be difficult to identify and that choosing a protease to generate peptides containing fewer D/E residues will improve identification of highly acidic proteins.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveStereotactic-EEG (SEEG) and scalp EEG recordings can be modeled using mesoscale neural mass population models (NMM). However, the relationship between those mathematical models and the physics of the measurements is unclear. In addition, it is challenging to represent SEEG data by combining NMMs and volume conductor models due to the intermediate spatial scale represented by these measurements.\n\nApproachWe provide a framework combining the multicompartmental modeling formalism and a detailed geometrical model to simulate the transmembrane currents that appear in layer 3, 5 and 6 pyramidal cells due to a synaptic input. With this approach, it is possible to realistically simulate the current source density (CSD) depth profile inside a cortical patch due to inputs localized into a single cortical layer and the induced voltage measured by two SEEG contacts using a volume conductor model. Based on this approach, we built a framework to connect the activity of a NMM with a volume conductor model and we simulated an example of SEEG signal as a proof of concept.\n\nMain resultsCSD depends strongly on the distribution of the synaptic inputs onto the different cortical layers and the equivalent current dipole strengths display substantial differences (of up to a factor of four in magnitude in our example). Thus, the inputs coming from different neural populations do not contribute equally to the electrophysiological recordings. A direct consequence of this is that the raw output of neural mass models is not a good proxy for electrical recordings. We also show that the simplest CSD model that can accurately reproduce SEEG measurements can be constructed from discrete monopolar sources (one per cortical layer).\n\nSignificanceOur results highlight the importance of including a physical model in NMMs to represent measurements. We provide a framework connecting microscale neuron models with the neural mass formalism and with physical models of the measurement process that can improve the accuracy of predicted electrophysiological recordings.",

    "abstract": "Different high temperatures adversely affect crop and algal yields with various responses in photosynthetic cells. The list of genes required for thermotolerance remains elusive. Additionally, it is unclear how carbon source availability affects heat responses in plants and algae. We utilized the insertional, indexed, genome-saturating mutant library of the unicellular, eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to perform genome-wide, quantitative, pooled screens under moderate (35{degrees}C) or acute (40{degrees}C) high temperatures with or without organic carbon sources. We identified heat-sensitive mutants based on quantitative growth rates and identified putative heat tolerance genes (HTGs). By triangulating HTGs with heat-induced transcripts or proteins in wildtype cultures and MapMan functional annotations, we present a high/medium-confidence list of 933 Chlamydomonas genes with putative roles in heat tolerance. Triangulated HTGs include those with known thermotolerance roles and novel genes with little or no functional annotation. About 50% of these high-confidence HTGs in Chlamydomonas have orthologs in green lineage organisms, including crop species. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants deficient in the ortholog of a high-confidence Chlamydomonas HTG were also heat sensitive. This work expands our knowledge of heat responses in photosynthetic cells and provides engineering targets to improve thermotolerance in algae and crops.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity is the norm in biology. The brain is no different: neuronal cell-types are myriad, reflected through their cellular morphology, type, excitability, connectivity motifs and ion channel distributions. While this biophysical diversity enriches neural systems dynamical repertoire, it remains challenging to reconcile with the robustness and persistence of brain function over time. To better understand the relationship between heterogeneity and resilience, we analyzed both analytically and numerically a non-linear sparse neural network with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections evolving over long time scales. We examined how neural diversity expressed as excitability heterogeneity in this network influences its dynamic volatility (i.e., its susceptibility to critical transitions). We exposed this network to slowly-varying modulatory fluctuations, continuously interrogating its stability and resilience. Our results show that excitability heterogeneity implements a homeostatic control mechanism tuning network stability in a context-dependent way. Such diversity was also found to enhance network resilience, quenching the volatility of its dynamics, effectively making the system independent of changes in many control parameters, such as population size, connection probability, strength and variability of synaptic weights as well as modulatory drive. Taken together, these results highlight the fundamental role played by cell-type heterogeneity in the robustness of brain function in the face of change.\n\nSignificance StatementContemporary research has identified widespread cell-to-cell intrinsic diversity in the brain, manifest through variations in biophysical features such as neuronal excitability. A natural question that arises from this phenomenon is what functional role, if any, this heterogeneity might serve. Combining computational and mathematical techniques, this interdisciplinary research shows that intrinsic cell-to-cell diversity, far from mere developmental noise, represents a homeostatic control mechanism, promoting the resilience of neuronal circuits. These results highlight the importance of diversity in the robustness and persistence of brain function over time and in the face of change.",

In this work, we use agent-based simulations of diffusion to investigate how heterogenous viscosity affects movement and concentration of diffusing particles. We propose that a nonequilibrium mode of membraneless compartmentalization arising from the convergence of diffusive trajectories into viscous sinks, which we call \"diffusive lensing,\" can occur in a wide parameter space and is thus likely to be ubiquitous in living systems. Our work highlights the phenomenon of diffusive lensing as a potentially key driver of mesoscale dynamics in the cytoplasm, with possible far-reaching implications for biochemical processes.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is characterised by varied responses to different anticancer therapies, which may provoke several different off-target effects. We hypothesise that for drugs that target cell surface receptors (CSRs), the different responses of tumours and the adverse events produced by these drugs may be attributed to variations in the transcriptional landscapes of CSRs in both breast tumours and healthy tissues. Here, we use data from various sources to compare the CSR transcriptional landscapes of breast tumours and a range of different non-diseased human tissues. We demonstrate an association between the responses to drug perturbation of breast cancer cell lines and the transcription levels of their targeted CSRs. Furthermore, we reveal important differences in the CSR transcriptional landscapes of primary breast tumour subtypes and the CSR transcriptional landscapes of breast cancer cell lines, which will likely impact the accuracy of drug response predictions. Finally, applying clinical trial data, we expose a link between the expression levels of CSR genes in healthy tissues and adverse reactions of patients to anticancer drugs. Altogether, this approach allows for the isolation of the most suitable CSR target(s) among the expressed transcripts, solely based on the measured dose-responses of cell lines to small molecules, the CSR transcriptional landscape in health patient tissues, and reported adverse responses of patients to drugs targeting CSRs.",

    "abstract": "Models that predict brain responses to stimuli provide one measure of understanding of a sensory system, and have many potential applications in science and engineering. Stimulus-computable sensory models are thus a longstanding goal of neuroscience. Deep neural networks have emerged as the leading such predictive models of the visual system, but are less explored in audition. Prior work provided examples of audio-trained neural networks that produced good predictions of auditory cortical fMRI responses and exhibited correspondence between model stages and brain regions, but left it unclear whether these results generalize to other neural network models, and thus how to further improve models in this domain. We evaluated model-brain correspondence for publicly available audio neural network models along with in-house models trained on four different tasks. Most tested models out-predicted previous filter-bank models of auditory cortex, and exhibited systematic model-brain correspondence: middle stages best predicted primary auditory cortex while deep stages best predicted non-primary cortex. However, some state-of-the-art models produced substantially worse brain predictions. Models trained on clean speech (without added background noise) produced worse brain predictions, potentially because hearing in noise imposes constraints on biological auditory representations. The training task influenced the prediction quality for specific cortical tuning properties, with best overall predictions resulting from models trained on multiple tasks. The results generally support the promise of deep neural networks as models of audition, though they also indicate that current models do not explain auditory cortical responses in their entirety.",

Here we present a novel near full-length AIRR-seq (FLAIRR-Seq) method that utilizes targeted amplification by 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), combined with single molecule, real-time sequencing to generate highly accurate (>Q40, 99.99%) IG heavy chain transcripts. FLAIRR-seq was benchmarked by comparing IG heavy chain variable (IGHV), diversity (IGHD), and joining (IGHJ) gene usage, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length, and somatic hypermutation to matched datasets generated with standard 5 RACE AIRR-seq and full-length isoform sequencing. Together these data demonstrate robust, unbiased FLAIRR-seq performance using RNA samples derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, purified B cells, and whole blood, which recapitulated results generated by commonly used methods, while additionally resolving novel IG heavy chain constant (IGHC) gene features. FLAIRR-seq data provides, for the first time, simultaneous, single-molecule characterization of IGHV, IGHD, IGHJ, and IGHC region genes and alleles, allele-resolved subisotype definition, and high-resolution identification of class-switch recombination within a clonal lineage. In conjunction with genomic sequencing and genotyping of IGHC genes, FLAIRR-seq of the IgM and IgG repertoires from 10 individuals resulted in the identification of 32 unique IGHC alleles, 28 (87%) of which were previously uncharacterized. Together, these data demonstrate the capabilities of FLAIRR-seq to characterize IGHV, IGHD, IGHJ, and IGHC gene diversity for the most comprehensive view of bulk expressed Ab repertoires to date.",

    "abstract": "Assays utilizing molecular fluorophores are common throughout life science research and diagnostic testing, although detection limits are generally limited by weak emission intensity, thus requiring many labeled target molecules to combine their output to achieve signal-to-noise greater than the background. Here, we describe how the synergistic coupling of plasmonic and photonic resonance modes can significantly boost the emission from fluorescent dye molecules without increasing the illumination intensity while utilizing a microscopy approach with a broad field of view. By optimally matching the resonant modes of a plasmonic fluor (PF) nanoparticle and a photonic crystal (PC) surface with the absorption and emission spectrum of the PFs fluorescent dye, we observe a 52-fold improvement in signal intensity, enabling individual PFs to be observed and digitally counted, using an approach in which one PF tag represents detection of one target molecule. The photonic amplification from the PF can be attributed to the strong near-field enhancement due to the cavity-induced activation of the PF, PC band structure-mediated improvement in collection efficiency of emitted photons, and increased rate of spontaneous emission. We demonstrate the applicability of the method by dose-response characterization of a sandwich immunoassay for human interleukin-6, a biomarker commonly used to assist diagnosis of cancer, inflammation, sepsis, and autoimmune disease. We achieve a limit of detection of 10 fg/ml, representing a capability three orders of magnitude lower than standard immunoassays.",

This results in rare events, which take longer to occur than the fastest processes in the model.

However, these packages frequently require expertise to get started with, making it harder for researchers to start using them.

WEBNG simplifies rare event sampling in simulations of rule-based models by taking a model specified in the BioNetGen language (BNGL) and generating a WESTPA simulation folder ready to simulate with default parameters selected to match model observables. WEBNG is written in Python with dependencies only on proven, open-source packages that are in active development, which makes WEBNG easy to install and maintain.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPCR amplification is a necessary step in many next generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation methods[1] [2]. Whilst many PCR enzymes are developed to amplify single targets efficiently, accurately and with specificity, few are developed to meet the challenges imposed by NGS PCR, namely unbiased amplification of a wide range of different sizes and GC content. As a result PCR amplification during NGS library prep often results in bias toward GC neutral and smaller fragments. As NGS has matured, optimised NGS library prep kits and polymerase formulations have emerged and in this study we have tested a wide selection of available enzymes for both short read Illumina library preparation and long fragment amplification ahead of long-read sequencing.\n\nResultsWe tested over 20 different Hi-fidelity PCR enzymes/NGS amplification mixes on a range of Illumina library templates of varying GC content and composition, and find that both yield and genome coverage uniformity characteristics of the commercially available enzymes varied dramatically. Three enzymes Quantabio RepliQa Hifi Toughmix, Watchmaker Library Amplification Hot Start Master Mix (2X) \"Equinox\" and Takara Ex Premier were found to give a consistent performance, over all genomes, that mirrored closely that observed for PCR free datasets. We also test a range of enzymes for long read sequencing by amplifying size fractionated S. cerevisiae DNA of average size 21.6 and 13.4kb respectively.\n\nConclusionThe enzymes of choice for short read (Illumina) library fragment amplification are Quantabio RepliQa Hifi Toughmix, Watchmaker Library Amplification Hot Start Master Mix (2X) \"Equinox\" and Takara Ex Premier, with RepliQa also being the best performing enzyme from the enzymes tested for long fragment amplification prior to long read sequencing.",

Over hundreds of genes and thousands of genetic variants were reported to be highly penetrant and causative of ASD. Many of these mutations cause comorbidities such as epilepsy and intellectual disabilities (ID). In this study, we measured cortical neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients with four mutations in the genes GRIN2B, SHANK3, UBTF, as well as chromosomal duplication in the 7q11.23 region and compared them to neurons derived from a first-degree relative without the mutation. Using a whole-cell patch-clamp, we observed that the mutant cortical neurons demonstrated hyperexcitability and early maturation compared to control lines. These changes were characterized by increased sodium currents, increased amplitude and rate of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), and more evoked action potentials in response to current stimulation in early-stage cell development (3-5 weeks post differentiation). These changes that appeared in all the different mutant lines, together with previously reported data, indicate that an early maturation and hyperexcitability may be a convergent phenotype of ASD cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "Septins are cytoskeletal proteins interacting with the inner plasma membrane and other cytoskeletal partners. Being key in membrane remodeling processes, they often localize at specific micrometric curvatures. To analyze the behavior of human septins at the membrane, we have used a combination of methods to assay their ultrastructural organization, their curvature sensitivity as well as their role in membrane reshaping. In contrast to budding yeast septins, on membranes, human septins systematically organize into a two-layered mesh of orthogonal filaments instead of generating parallel sheets of filaments observed for budding yeast septins. This peculiar mesh organization is curvature sensitive and drives membrane reshaping as well. The observed membrane deformations together with the filamentous organization are recapitulated in a coarsegrained computed simulation to understand their mechanisms. Our results highlight the specificity of animal septins as opposed to fungal proteins.",

However, the cost of these DNA ladders is not insignificant and, over time, impinges on the funds available for research and training in molecular biology. Here, we describe a method for the generation of \"pHAPE\", a plasmid from which a variety of DNA ladders can be generated via simple restriction enzyme digestions. The pHAPE plasmid can be generated by mutagenesis of the commonly used pBluescript II SK+ phagemid followed by insertion of a custom 7,141 bp sequence (made up of three smaller fragments).

    "abstract": "Descriptive data are rapidly expanding in biomedical research. Instead, functional validation methods with sufficient complexity remain underdeveloped. Transcriptional reporters allow experimental characterization and manipulation of developmental and disease cell states, but their design lacks flexibility. Here, we report logical design of synthetic cis-regulatory DNA(LSD), a computational framework leveraging phenotypic biomarkers and trans-regulatory networks as input to design reporters marking the activity of selected cellular states and pathways. LSD uses bulk or single-cell biomarkers and a reference genome or custom cis-regulatory DNA datasets with user-defined boundary regions. By benchmarking validated reporters, we integrated LSD with a computational classifier to rank phenotypic specificity of putative cis-regulatory DNA. Experimentally, LSD-designed reporters targeting a wide range of cell states are functional without minimal promoters. In silico, an LSD-unsupervised mesenchymal glioblastoma reporter outperformed previously validated ones. In genome-scale CRISPRa screens, it discovered known and novel bona fide cell-state-drivers. Thus, LSD captures core principles of cis-regulation and is broadly applicable to studying complex cell states and mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women has become an epidemic in the United States. Pharmacological interventions for OUD involve methadone, a synthetic opioid analgesic that attenuates withdrawal symptoms and behaviors linked with maternal drug abuse. However, methadones ability to readily accumulate in neural tissue, and cause long-term neurocognitive sequelae, has led to concerns regarding its effect on prenatal brain development. We took advantage of human cortical organoid (hCO) technology to probe how this drug impacts the earliest mechanisms giving rise to the cerebral cortex. To this end, we conducted bulk mRNA sequencing of 2-month-old hCOs derived from two cell lines that were chronically treated with a clinically relevant dose of 1M methadone for 50 days. Differential expression and gene ontology analyses revealed a robust transcriptional response to methadone associated with functional components of the synapse, the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and cilia. Further unsupervised co-expression network and predictive protein-protein interaction analyses demonstrated that these changes occurred in concert, centered around a regulatory axis consisting of growth factors, developmental signaling pathways, and matricellular proteins. Our results demonstrate that exposure to methadone during early cortico-genesis fundamentally alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation, and that these changes arise by modulating extra-synaptic molecular mechanisms in the ECM and cilia. These findings provide novel insight into methadones putative effect on cognitive and behavioral development and a basis for improving interventions for maternal opioid addiction.",

Its expression is dysregulated with an overexpression in tumors and a connection with tumors of adverse prognosis.\n\nMethodsWe developed C57BL/6 mouse models co-expressing human huBTLA and huHVEM as well as antagonistic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that completely prevent the interactions of HVEM with its ligands.\n\nResultsHere, we show that the anti-HVEM18-10 mAb increases primary human {beta}-T cells activity alone (CIS-activity) or in the presence of HVEM-expressing lung or colorectal cancer cells in vitro (TRANS-activity). Anti-HVEM18-10 synergizes with anti-PD-L1 mAb to activate T cells in the presence of PDL-1 positive tumors, but is sufficient to trigger T cell activation in the presence of PD-L1 negative cells. In order to better understand HVEM18-10 effect in vivo and especially disentangle its CIS and TRANS effects, we developed a knock-in (KI) mouse model expressing human BTLA (huBTLA+/+) and a KI mouse model expressing both human BTLA and human HVEM (huBTLA+/+ /huHVEM+/+ (DKI)). In vivo pre-clinical experiments performed in both mouse models showed that HVEM18-10 treatment was efficient to decrease human HVEM+ tumor growth. In the DKI model, anti-HVEM 18-10 treatment induces a decrease of exhausted CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells and an increase of Effector memory CD4+ T cells within the tumor. Interestingly, mice which completely rejected tumors ({+/-} 20%) did not develop tumors upon re-challenge in both settings, therefore showing a marked T cell-memory phenotype effect.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, our preclinical models validate anti-HVEM18-10 as a promising therapeutic antibody to use in clinics as a monotherapy or in combination with existing immunotherapies (anti-PD1/anti-PDL-1/anti-CTLA-4).",

This lesion is deeply buried within the double-helix and its detection requires careful inspection of the bases by OGG1 via a mechanism that remains only partially understood. By analyzing OGG1 dynamics in the nucleus of living human cells, we demonstrate that the glycosylase constantly scans the DNA by rapidly alternating between diffusion within the nucleoplasm and short transits on the DNA. This scanning process, that we find to be tightly regulated by the conserved residue G245, is crucial for the rapid recruitment of OGG1 at oxidative lesions induced by laser micro-irradiation. Furthermore, we show that residues Y203, N149 and N150, while being all involved in early stages of 8-oxoG probing by OGG1 based on previous structural data, differentially regulate the scanning of the DNA and recruitment to oxidative lesions.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is an important agricultural crop around the world, and previous studies suggest that honey bees can be a component for optimizing soybean production through pollination. Determining when bees are present in soybean fields is critical for assessing pollination activity and identifying periods when bees are absent so that bee-toxic pesticides may be applied. There are currently several methods for detecting pollinator activity, but these existing methods have substantial limitations, including the bias of pan trappings against large bees and the limited duration of observation possible using manual techniques. This study aimed to develop a new method for detecting honey bees in soybean fields using bioacoustics monitoring. Microphones were placed in soybean fields to record the audible wingbeats of foraging bees. Foraging activity was identified using the wingbeat frequency of honey bees (234{+/-}13.9 Hz) through a combination of algorithmic and manual approaches. A total of 243 honey bees were detected over ten days of recording in four soybean fields. Bee activity was significantly greater in blooming fields than in non-blooming fields. Temperature had no significant effect on bee activity, but bee activity differed significantly between soybean varieties, suggesting that soybean attractiveness to honey bees is heavily dependent on varietal characteristics. Refinement of bioacoustics methods, particularly through incorporation of machine learning, could provide a practical tool for measuring activity of honey bees and other flying insects in soybeans as well as other crops and ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The amount of data stored in genomic sequence databases is growing exponentially, far exceeding traditional indexing strategies processing capabilities. Many recent indexing methods organize sequence data into a sequence graph to succinctly represent large genomic data sets from reference genome and sequencing read set databases. These methods typically use De Bruijn graphs as the graph model or the underlying index model, with auxiliary graph annotation data structures to associate graph nodes with various metadata. Examples of metadata can include a nodes source samples (called labels), genomic coordinates, expression levels, etc.\n\nAn important property of these graphs is that the set of sequences spelled by graph walks is a superset of the set of input sequences. Thus, when aligning to graphs indexing samples derived from low-coverage sequencing sets, sequence information present in many target samples can compensate for missing information resulting from a lack of sequence coverage. Aligning a query against an entire sequence graph (as in traditional sequence-to-graph alignment) using state-of-the-art algorithms can be computationally intractable for graphs constructed from thousands of samples, potentially searching through many non-biological combinations of samples before converging on the best alignment.\n\nTo address this problem, we propose a novel alignment strategy called multi-label alignment (MLA) and an algorithm implementing this strategy using annotated De Bruijn graphs within the MetaGraph framework, called MetaGraph-MLA. MLA extends current sequence alignment scoring models with additional label change operations for incorporating mixtures of samples into an alignment, penalizing mixtures that are dissimilar in their sequence content. To overcome disconnects in the graph that result from a lack of sequencing coverage, we further extend our graph index to utilize a variable-order De Bruijn graph and introduce node length change as an operation. In this model, traversal between nodes that share a suffix of length < k - 1 acts as a proxy for inserting nodes into the graph.\n\nMetaGraph-MLA constructs an MLA of a query by chaining single-label alignments using sparse dynamic programming. We evaluate MetaGraph-MLA on simulated data against state-of-the-art sequence-to-graph aligners. We demonstrate increases in alignment lengths for simulated viral Illumina-type (by 6.5%), PacBio CLR-type (by 6.2%), and PacBio CCS-type (by 6.7%) sequencing reads, respectively, and show that the graph walks incorporated into our MLAs originate predominantly from samples of the same strain as the reads ground-truth samples. We envision MetaGraph-MLA as a step towards establishing sequence graph tools for sequence search against a wide variety of target sequence types.",

    "abstract": "The current dogma about the heartbeat origin is based on \"the pacemaker cell\", a specialized cell residing in the sinoatrial node (SAN) that exhibits spontaneous diastolic depolarization triggering rhythmic action potentials (APs). Recent high-resolution imaging, however, demonstrated that Ca signals and APs in the SAN are heterogeneous, with many cells generating APs of different rates and rhythms or even remaining non-firing (dormant cells), i.e. generating only subthreshold signals. Here we numerically tested a hypothesis that a community of dormant cells can generate normal automaticity, i.e. \"the pacemaker cell\" is not required to initiate rhythmic cardiac impulses. Our model includes (i) non-excitable cells generating oscillatory local Ca releases and (ii) an excitable cell lacking automaticity. While each cell in isolation was not \"the pacemaker cell\", the cell system generated rhythmic APs: the subthreshold signals of non-excitable cells were transformed into respective membrane potential oscillations via electrogenic Na/Ca exchange and further transferred and integrated (computed) by the excitable cells to reach its AP threshold, generating rhythmic pacemaking. Conclusions: Cardiac impulse is an emergent property of the SAN cellular network and can be initiated by cells lacking intrinsic automaticity. Cell heterogeneity, weak coupling, subthreshold signals, and their summation are critical properties of the new pacemaker mechanism, i.e cardiac pacemaker can operate via a signaling process basically similar to that of \"temporal summation\" happening in a neuron with input from multiple presynaptic cells. The new mechanism, however, does not refute the classical pacemaker cell-based mechanism: both mechanisms can co-exist and interact within SAN tissue.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a promising class of compounds to fight antibiotic-resistant infections. In most cases, they kill bacteria by making their membrane permeable and therefore exhibit low propensity to induce bacterial resistance. In addition, they are often selective, killing bacteria at concentrations lower than those at which they are toxic to the host. However, clinical applications of AMPs are hindered by a limited understanding of their interactions with bacteria and human cells. Standard susceptibility testing methods are based on the analysis of the growth of a bacterial population and therefore require several hours. Moreover, different assays are required to assess the toxicity to host cells. In this work, we propose the use of microfluidic impedance cytometry to explore the action of AMPs on both bacteria and host cells, in a rapid manner and with single-cell resolution. We show that the electrical signatures of Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium) cells and human red blood cells (RBCs) reflect the action of a representative antimicrobial peptide, DNS-PMAP23. In particular, the impedance phase at high frequency (e.g., 11 or 20 MHz) is a reliable label-free metric for monitoring DNS-PMAP23 bactericidal activity and toxicity to RBCs. The impedance-based characterization is validated by comparison with standard antibacterial activity assays and absorbance-based hemolytic activity assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of the technique to a mixed sample of B. megaterium cells and RBCs, which paves the way to study AMP selectivity for bacterial versus eukaryotic cells in presence of both cell types.",

    "abstract": "Halophytes are salt-tolerant plants that grow in soil or waters of high salinity. Schrenkiella parvula is one of the halophyte plants that grow around Tuz (Salt) Lake, TURKEY that can survive at 600 mM NaCl. Intriguingly, S. parvula belongs to the same Brassicaceae family as the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and its genome is 90% homologous to the Arabidopsis genome. Here, we performed proteomic analysis and physiological studies on the roots of S. parvula seedlings cultivated under a moderate salt condition at 100 mM NaCl. Surprisingly, under 100 mM NaCl conditions, the primary roots elongated much faster than under NaCl-free conditions, although up to 200 mM those were reduced. On the other hand, iso-osmotic mannitol did not promote primary root elongation, suggesting a specific response to NaCl. Epidermal cell elongation was promoted in the elongation zone, but meristem size and DNA replication were decreased. In addition, root hair formation and lateral root elongation were suppressed at moderate salinity. Compared with A. thaliana, the cell death and ROS increase of root tip meristem cells under 100 mM NaCl condition were significantly lower in S. parvula seedlings. The size and starch content of sedimentary amyloplasts/statoliths in columella cells decreased, and gravitropism of primary roots was partially reduced. Gene expression analyses showed that the expression of auxin response and biosynthesis genes IAA1, IAA2, TAA1 and YUC8 were repressed and the SOS1 gene was upregulated two-fold in roots grown under moderate salt conditions. Proteomic analysis showed that co-chaperone and activator of HSPs such as Hop2 and Aha1 domain-containing protein orthologs were upregulated. Moreover, several secondary metabolic process-related proteins, antioxidant proteins, stress response proteins and proline catabolic process-related proteins were also increased. In contrast, enzymes associated with root hair elongation and nucleotide and protein syntheses were downregulated. These changes in auxin-related physiological responses, root architecture, lower ROS signaling, and stress-related protein expression promote primary root penetration into lower-salinity deeper soils as an adaptation of S. parvula.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulatory nuclei that are part of the ascending arousal system (AAS) play a crucial role in regulating cortical state and optimizing task performance. Pupil diameter, under constant luminance conditions, is increasingly used as an index of activity of these AAS nuclei. Indeed, task-based functional imaging studies in humans have begun to provide evidence of stimulus-driven pupil-AAS coupling. However, whether there is such a tight pupil-AAS coupling during rest is not clear. To address this question, we examined simultaneously acquired resting-state fMRI and pupil-size data from 74 participants, focusing on six AAS nuclei: the locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and cholinergic basal forebrain. Activation in all six AAS nuclei was optimally correlated with pupil size at 0-to 2-second lags, suggesting that spontaneous pupil changes were almost immediately followed by corresponding BOLD-signal changes in the AAS. These results suggest that spontaneous changes in pupil size that occur during states of rest can be used as a noninvasive general index of activity in AAS nuclei. Importantly, the nature of pupil-AAS coupling during rest appears to be vastly different from the relatively slow canonical hemodynamic response function that has been used to characterize task-related pupil-AAS coupling.",

    "abstract": "Individuals within both moving and stationary groups arrange themselves in a predictable manner; for example, some individuals are consistently found at the front of the group or in the periphery and others in the center. Each position may be associated with various costs, such as greater exposure to predators, and benefits, such as preferential access to food. In social bats, we would expect a similar consistent arrangement for groups at roost-sites, which is where these mammals spend the largest portion of their lives. Here we study the relative position of individuals within a roost-site and establish if sex, age, and vocal behavior are associated with a given position. We focus on the highly cohesive and mobile social groups found in Spixs disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor) given this species use of a tubular roosting structure that forces individuals to be arranged linearly within its internal space. We obtained high scores for linearity measures, particularly for the top and bottom positions, indicating that bats position themselves in a predictable way despite constant roost-switching. We also found that sex and age were associated with the use of certain positions within the roost; for example, males and subadults tend to occupy the top part (near the roosts entrance) more often than expected by chance. Previous studies have shown that communally-roosting species often scramble to gain access to central positions, which are typically occupied by dominant individuals; thus, we speculate that our findings could also indicate some form of dominance hierarchy in our study species.\n\nLAY SUMMARYSelecting an ideal position may be a critical decision for bats that roost inside developing tubular leaves. By tracking the position of disc-winged bats within their vertical roosts, we show that individuals are arranged linearly in a consistent manner. Our results suggest that dominance hierarchies might influence individual positions and hint at the existence of differential costs/benefits associated to each position.",

    "abstract": "Principles of social evolution have long been used retrospectively to interpret social interactions, but have less commonly been applied predictively to inform conservation and animal husbandry strategies. We investigate whether past social selection can predict resilience to environmental change. Upon exposure to harsh novel environments, populations that previously experienced more benign social environments are predicted either to suffer fitness losses (the \"mutation load hypothesis\" and \"selection filter hypothesis\") or maintain fitness (the \"beneficial mutation hypothesis\"). We tested these contrasting predictions using populations of burying beetles Nicrophorus vespilloides evolved experimentally for 48 generations under harsh versus benign social environments through manipulation of parental care. We exposed sexually immature adults from each population to varying heat stress and measured the effect on survival and reproduction. The more benign the social environment previously experienced by a population, the better its survival under heat stress during sexual maturation. Although consistent with the \"beneficial mutation hypothesis\", it is also possible that populations evolved under the harsher social environment were more prone to dying during maturation, regardless of their thermal environment. Overall, stochastic genetic variation, probably due to founder effects, was a better predictor of resilience. We discuss the implications for translocation and captive breeding programmes.",

    "abstract": "Both the identity and the amount of a carbon source present in laboratory or industrial cultivation media have major impacts on the growth and physiology of a microbial species. In the case of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sucrose is arguably the most important sugar used in industrial biotechnology, whereas glucose is the most common carbon and energy source used in research, with many well-known and described regulatory effects, e.g. glucose repression. Here we compared the label-free proteomes of exponentially growing S. cerevisiae cells in a defined medium containing either sucrose or glucose as the sole carbon source. For this purpose, bioreactor cultivations were employed, and three different strains were investigated, namely: CEN.PK113-7D (a common laboratory strain), UFMG-CM-Y259 (a wild isolate), and JP1 (an industrial bioethanol strain). These strains present different physiologies during growth on sucrose; some of them reach higher specific growth rates on this carbon source, when compared to growth on glucose, whereas others display the opposite behavior. It was not possible to identify proteins that commonly presented either higher or lower levels during growth on sucrose, when compared to growth on glucose, considering the three strains investigated here, except for one protein, named Mnp1 - a mitochondrial ribosomal protein of the large subunit, which had higher levels on sucrose than on glucose, for all three strains. Interestingly, following a Gene Ontology overrepresentation and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses, an inverse pattern of enriched biological functions and pathways was observed for the strains CEN.PK113-7D and UFMG-CM-Y259, which is in line with the fact that whereas the CEN.PK113-7D strain grows faster on glucose than on sucrose, the opposite is observed for the UFMG-CM-Y259 strain.",

    "abstract": "Microbial genomes encode functional repertoire of microbes. However, microbes rely on various proteins to be expressed to carry out specific functions, and the expression of those proteins can be affected by the environment. It remains elusive how the selective expression of a protein depends on whether it is metabolically essential to the microbes growth, or it can claim resources as an ecological niche. Here we show that by pairing metagenomics and metaproteomics data we can reveal whether a protein is relevant for occupying ecological niches or is essential for microbial metabolism. In particular, we developed a computational pipeline based on the quantification of the gene-level (or protein-level) functional redundancy of each protein, which measures the degree to which phylogenetically unrelated taxa can express (or have already expressed) the same protein, respectively. We validated this pipeline using both simulated data of a consumer-resource model and real data of human gut microbiome samples. Furthermore, for the real data, we showed that the metabolic and ecological roles of ABC-type transporters and ribosomal proteins predicted by our pipeline agree well with prior knowledge. Finally, we performed in vitro culture of a human gut microbiome sample and investigated how oversupplying various sugars involved in ecological niches influences the community structure and protein expression. The presented results help us identify metabolic and ecological roles of proteins, which will inform the design of nutrient interventions to modulate the human microbiome.",

However, little is known about how NPs shape the gut immune landscape after entering the body. The objective of the study was to explore indirect effects caused by the interaction of NPs with the mammalian gut and whole immune system after entering the body.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we fabricated NPs ([~]500 nm) and microplastics (MPs) ([~]2 m) and aimed to evaluate their in vivo effects by feeding them in mice. The mechanism was then investigated by various technology including single-cell RNA sequencing of gut and brain tissue.\n\nResultsThe results suggested that NPs showed a better ability to induce gut macrophage activation than did MPs. In addition, NPs triggered gut interleukin 1 beta (IL-1{beta})-producing macrophage reprogramming via inducing lysosomal damage after phagocytosis. More importantly, IL-1{beta} released from the intestine could affect brain immunity, leading to microglial activation and Th17 differentiation, all of which correlated with a decline in cognitive and short-term memory in NPs-fed mice\n\nConclusionsThus, this study provides new insight into the mechanism of action of the gut-brain axis and delineates the way NPs reduce brain function, highlights the importance to fix the plastic pollution problem worldwide.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). With current sequencing methods, it is difficult to assign ARGs to their microbial hosts, particularly if these ARGs are located on plasmids. Metagenomic chromosome conformation capture approaches (meta3C and Hi-C), have recently been developed to link bacterial genes to phylogenetic markers, thus potentially allowing the assignment of ARGs to their hosts on a microbiome-wide scale.\n\nHere, we generated a meta3C dataset of a human stool sample and used previously published meta3C and Hi-C datasets to investigate bacterial hosts of ARGs in the human gut microbiome. Sequence reads mapping to repetitive elements were found to cause problematic noise in, and may importantly skew interpretation of, meta3C and Hi-C data. We provide a strategy to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by discarding reads that map to repetitive elements and to the end of contigs. We also show the importance of using spike-in controls to quantify whether the cross-linking step in meta3C and Hi-C protocols has been successful.\n\nAfter filtering for spurious links, 87 ARGs were linked to their bacterial hosts across all datasets, including 27 ARGs in the meta3C dataset we generated. We show that commensal gut bacteria are an important reservoir for ARGs, with genes encoding for aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance being widespread in anaerobic commensals of the human gut.",

Evaluation of lipids in HepG2 cells lacking TANGO2 revealed an increase in the size of lipid droplets and reactive oxygen species production. There is also a marked increase lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and a concomitant decrease in its biosynthetic precursor phosphatidic acid (PA). These changes are exacerbated in nutrient starved cells. Based on our data, we suggest that the principle function of TANGO2 is in acyl-CoA metabolism, which is necessary for the acylation of LPA to generate PA. This defect subsequently affects metabolism of many other fatty acids. These data help explain the physiological consequence of TANGO2 that induce acute metabolic crisis including rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias often leading to fatality upon starvation and stress.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis for complex, heterogeneous disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a persistent challenge in human medicine. Owing to their phenotypic complexity, the genetic mechanisms underlying these disorders may be highly variable across individual patients. Furthermore, much of their heritability is unexplained by known regulatory or coding variants. Indeed, there is evidence that much of the causal genetic variation stems from rare and de novo variants arising from ongoing mutation. These variants occur mostly in noncoding regions, likely affecting regulatory processes for genes linked to the phenotype of interest. However, because there is no uniform code for assessing regulatory function, it is difficult to separate these mutations into likely functional and nonfunctional subsets. This makes finding associations between complex diseases and potentially causal de novo single-nucleotide variants (dnSNVs) a difficult task. To date, all but one published study in this area has failed to find any significant associations between dnSNVs from ASD patients and any class of known regulatory elements. We sought to identify the underlying reasons for this and present strategies for overcoming these challenges. We show that, contrary to previous claims, the main reason for failure to find robust statistical enrichments is not the number of families sampled, but the quality and relevance to ASD of the annotations used to prioritize dnSNVs, and the reliability of the set of dnSNVs itself. We present a list of recommendations for designing future studies of this sort that will help researchers avoid common pitfalls.",

We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the whole genome of M. nigrescens using nanopore long-reads and 10X chromium link-reads. The assembly is 524 Mb in size consisting of 867 scaffolds. The N50 value is 2.42 Mb, and half of the assembly is in the 30 longest scaffolds. The assembly BUSCO score from the eukaryotic database (eukaryota_odb10) indicates that the genome is 86.7% complete and 5.1% partial. The genome has a high level of heterozygosity (6.6%) with a repeat content of 78.7%. mRNA-seq reads from different sized nematodes ([&le;]2 cm, 3.5-7 cm, and >7 cm body length) representing different developmental stages were also generated and used for the genome annotation. Using ab initio and evidence-based gene model predictions, 12,313 protein-coding genes and 24,186 mRNAs were annotated.

As proof of its broad applicability, we implement liCHi-C to study normal and malignant human hematopoietic hierarchy in clinical samples. We demonstrate that the dynamic promoter architecture identifies developmental trajectories and orchestrates transcriptional transitions during cell-state commitment. Moreover, liCHi-C enables the identification of new disease-relevant cell types, genes and pathways potentially deregulated by non-coding alterations at distal regulatory elements. Finally, we show that liCHi-C can be harnessed to uncover genome-wide structural variants, resolve their breakpoints and infer their pathogenic effects.

Future studies, integrating the socioecology and cognitive ethology of penguins, may provide insights into whether our experimental paradigms could provide evidence to confirm the presence of self-awareness and even of self-recognition in this species and examine whether the observed social awareness may have evolved due to the social needs of individual penguins to engage in cooperative behaviour with conspecific individuals, while maintaining their independent decision-making capacities, throughout their communal lives.",

Specifically, TCTP binds Bcl-xL and inhibits the Bax-dependent Bcl-xL-induced cytochrome c release and TCTP reduces Mcl-1 turnover by inhibiting its ubiquitinylation, thus resulting in decreased Mcl-1 mediated apoptosis. TCTP owns a BH3-like motif forming a {beta}-strand buried in the globular domain of the protein. The crystal structure of TCTP BH3-like peptide in complex with Bcl-xL highlighted the -helical conformation of TCTP BH3-like motif, suggesting major changes in TCTP structure upon complex formation. However, the structural impact of the interaction on the full-length TCTP and the structural description of TCTP/Mcl-1 interaction are still lacking. Here using biophysical/biochemical methods (NMR, SAXS, circular dichroism, limited proteolysis), we provide an in-depth description of the TCTP/Mcl-1 complex. We demonstrate that full length TCTP binds to the BH3 binding groove of Mcl-1 via its BH3-like motif which interconverts between different binding modes at the micro- to milli-second timescale. As a consequence of the engagement of the BH3-like motif in the interface, the TCTP globular domain is destabilized into a molten-globule state. We also establish that the residue D16 in TCTP BH3-like motif is crucial for the stability and dynamics of the intermolecular interface. As a conclusion, we reveal here in details the structural plasticity of TCTP and discuss its implications for TCTP biology and for future anticancer drug design strategies aiming at targeting TCTP complexes.\n\nContactEwen Lescop, ewen.lescop@cnrs.fr.\n\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary figures, tables and files.",

    "abstract": "The stereoselective reduction of alkenes conjugated to electron-withdrawing groups by ene-reductases has been extensively applied to the commercial preparation of fine chemicals. Although several different enzyme families are known to possess ene-reductase activity, the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family has been the most thoroughly investigated. Recently, it was shown that a subset of ene-reductases belonging to the flavin/deazaflavin oxidoreductase (FDOR) superfamily exhibit enantioselectivity that is generally complementary to that seen in the OYE family. These enzymes belong to one of several FDOR subgroups that use the unusual deazaflavin cofactor F420. Here, we explore several enzymes of the FDOR-A subgroup, characterizing their substrate range and enantioselectivity, including the complete conversion of both isomers of citral to (R)-citronellel with 99% ee. Protein crystallography combined with computational docking has allowed the observed stereoselectivity to be mechanistically rationalized for two enzymes. These findings add further support for the FDOR and OYE families of ene-reductases being generally stereocomplementary to each other and highlight their potential value in asymmetric ene-reduction.",

    "abstract": "It is crucial to monitor the antibiotic levels in the environment like water, food products in the current scenario as the antibiotic concentration above threshold is harmful for the human health. Excess consumption of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance that hinders the control and cure of microbial diseases. So, these challenges motivated to devise an optical nano-senor which can sense the ultra-low concentration of antibiotics. In this proposed research work, emphasis is to develop a method which is simple and selective to analyze the detection and presence of antibiotics in various samples like tape water milk etc. using fluorescent ZnO QDs based nano-sensor. For this, fluorescent and different polymers (polyvinylalcohol - PVA and polyvinylpyrrolidine - PVP) capped ZnO QDs were synthesized using modified sol-gel technique. These were used as fluorescent probe to monitor the presence of antibiotics. The optical characterizations of synthesized QDs were performed using UV-Visible absorption & fluorescence spectroscopic methods while structural characteristics were analyzed by using FTIR, XRD and EDX. Charge on the synthesized QDs were obtained with the help of ZETA potential. Here ten different antibiotics were targeted among, Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin have shown excellent sensing and specificity with PVA-ZnO QDs and PVP-ZnO QDs respectively.",

    "abstract": "The nucleolus is a multilayered structure. Each layer is thought to be a compositionally distinct phase, although how these phases form and interface with one another remains unclear. Using computational, proteomics, in vitro, and in vivo studies, we uncover distinct molecular grammars within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of nucleolar proteins that localize to fibrillar centers (FCs) and dense fibrillar components (DFCs). FC and DFC proteins feature two distinct types of IDRs namely those with long tracts of acidic residues and those with blocks of lysines interspersed by acid-rich-regions. We find that phase separation driven by complex coacervation in mixtures of nucleolar proteins, with their distinctive IDRs, and ribosomal DNA and RNA molecules is sufficient to drive the formation of structural facsimiles of FCs and DFCs.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryFacsimiles of core nucleolar substructures were reconstituted via phase separation of key protein and nucleic acid mixtures.",

    "abstract": "A novel tobamovirus was identified in a fruit of Solanum macrocarpon imported into the Netherlands in 2018. This virus was further characterized in terms of host range, pathotype and genomic properties, because many tobamoviruses have the potential to cause severe damage in important crops. In the original fruit, two different genotypes of the novel virus were present. The virus was able to infect multiple plant species from the Solanaceae family after mechanical inoculation, as well as a member of the Apiaceae family. These species included economically important crops such as tomato and pepper, as well as eggplant and petunia. Both tomato and pepper germplasm were shown to harbor resistance against the novel virus. Since most commercial tomato and pepper varieties grown in European greenhouses harbor these relevant resistances, the risk of infection and subsequent impact on these crops is likely to be low in Europe. Assessment of the potential threat to eggplant, petunia, and other susceptible species needs further work. In conclusion, this study provides a first assessment of the potential phytosanitary risks of a newly discovered tobamovirus, which was tentatively named African eggplant-associated virus.",

We characterized a Zea mays ics1 mutant for impacts on metabolism, photosynthesis, and immune signaling. Phylloquinone was reduced in the mutant resulting in low electron transfer rates and high electron backflow rates. SA accumulation induced by autoactive alleles of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene Resistance to Puccinia sorgi1 (Rp1) required ics1. Induced accumulation of SA was not required for lesion formation by the autoactive Rp1-D21#4 allele. Metabolomic analyses and SA supplementation of Rp1-D21#4 mutants, ics1-1 mutants and Rp1-D21#4; ics1-1 double mutants demonstrated that most hypersensitive response-induced metabolism required ics1 but this was independent of SA accumulation. Both the PAL and ICS pathways contributed to SA biosynthesis in maize as labeled phenylalanine was incorporated into SA glucoside. Maize ics1-1 mutants had low PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA LYASE activity, accumulated phenylalanine, and decreased abundance of phenylalanine derived metabolites. This demonstrates that the ICS and PAL pathways interact by a yet unknown mechanism complicating the interpretation of SA biosynthesis in plants from genetics alone.",

    "abstract": "Accurate protein quantification is key to identifying protein markers, regulatory relationships between proteins, and pathophysiological mechanisms. Realizing this potential requires sensitive and deep protein analysis of a large number of samples. Toward this goal, proteomics throughput can be increased by parallelizing the analysis of both precursors and samples using multiplexed data independent acquisition (DIA) implemented by the plexDIA framework: https://plexDIA.slavovlab.net. Here we demonstrate the improved precisions of RT estimates within plexDIA and how this enables more accurate protein quantification. plexDIA has demonstrated multiplicative gains in throughput, and these gains may be substantially amplified by improving the multiplexing reagents, data acquisition and interpretation. We discuss future directions for advancing plexDIA, which include engineering optimized mass-tags for high-plexDIA, introducing isotopologous carriers, and developing algorithms that utilize the regular structures of plexDIA data to improve sensitivity, proteome coverage and quantitative accuracy. These advances in plexDIA will increase the throughput of functional proteomic assays, including quantifying protein conformations, turnover dynamics, modifications states and activities. The sensitivity of these assays will extend to single-cell analysis, thus enabling functional single-cell protein analysis.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/515287v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14d73f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7f008org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afd392org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16b20da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition with several major hallmarks, including loss of substantia nigra neurons, reduction in striatal dopaminergic function, and formation of -synuclein-rich Lewy bodies. Mutations in SNCA, encoding for -synuclein, are a known cause of familial PD, and the G51D mutation causes a particularly aggressive form of the condition. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to introduce the G51D mutation into the endogenous rat SNCA gene. SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats were born in Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit any severe behavourial defects. L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluorophenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was used to investigate this novel rat model. Wild-type (WT), SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats were characterised over the course of ageing (5, 11, and 16 months old) using 18F-DOPA PET imaging and kinetic modelling. We measured the influx rate constant (Ki) and effective distribution volume ratio (EDVR) of 18F-DOPA in the striatum relative to the cerebellum in WT, SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats. A significant reduction in EDVR was observed in SNCAG51D/G51D rats at 16 months of age indicative of increased dopamine turnover. Furthermore, we observed a significant asymmetry in EDVR between the left and right striatum in aged SNCAG51D/G51D rats. The increased and asymmetric dopamine turnover observed in the striatum of aged SNCAG51D/G51D rats is similar to prodromal PD, which suggests the presence of compensatory mechanisms. SNCAG51D rats represent a novel genetic model of PD, and kinetic modelling of 18F-DOPA PET data has identified a highly relevant early disease phenotype.",

This can be achieved by adjusting the properties of motor neurons, which form the final common pathway for all motor output from the central nervous system. Here we identify novel roles for a neuropeptide, Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript (CART), in the control of movement vigour. We reveal distinct, but parallel mechanisms by which CART and acetylcholine, both released at C bouton synapses on motor neurons, selectively amplify the output of subtypes of motor neurons that are recruited during intense movement. We find that mice with broad genetic deletion of CART or selective elimination of acetylcholine from C boutons exhibit deficits in behavioral tasks that require higher levels of motor output. Overall, these data uncover novel spinal modulatory mechanisms that control movement vigour to support movements that require a high degree of muscle force.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most serious global public health threats affecting lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) due to lack of awareness, inadequate healthcare and sanitation infrastructure, plus other environmental factors. In this study, we aimed to link microbial assembly and covariates (body mass index, smoking, use of antibiotics) to gut microbiome structure and correlate AMR gene prevalence.\n\nMethodsWe examined the gastrointestinal and oral microbial profiles of healthy adults in Pakistan through 16S rRNA gene sequencing with a focus on different ethnicities, antibiotic usage, drinking water type, smoking, and other demographic measures. We then utilised a suite of innovative statistical tools, driven by numerical ecology and machine learning, to address the above aims.\n\nResultsWe observed tap water as the main contributor for development of AMR in the Pakistani cohort. In addition, microbial niche breadth analysis based on null modelling procedures highlighted an aberrant gut microbial signature of smokers with increased age.\n\nConclusionsDrinking water plays a more important role in AMR spread in Pakistan rather than other factors considered. Moreover, covariates such as smoking, and age impact the human microbial community structure in this Pakistani cohort. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that provide a snapshot of the microbiomes of healthy individuals in Pakistan and considers AMR profiles with an emphasis on potential sources of AMR prevalence.\n\nBackground and ContextPakistan is categorized as a low-and-middle-income country by the World Bank where misuse of antibiotics is widespread, and multidrug resistance is prevalent. Thus, it is imperative that we understand antimicrobial resistance and the drivers of human microbiomes in Pakistan.\n\nNew FindingsIn a healthy Pakistani cohort, individuals that consumed Tap Water had almost 6-fold more associations with AMRs. Therefore, drinking water source could be a strong driver in the spread of AMR.\n\nLimitationsA limitation is the use of predictive functional profiles. However, shotgun metagenomics may be prohibitively costly for LMICs given the urgent need for AMR surveillance.\n\nClinical Research RelevanceOur research shows strong associations of key microbial taxa with covariates such as age, BMI, and gender. Additionally, we show correlations between specific outlier taxa that are present both in the gut and oral communities, highlighting potential future feasibility for use of the oral microbiome as a proxy to gut dysbiosis in some cases.\n\nBasic Research RelevanceWe have applied recent advancements in analytical tools to link both AMR prevalence and human microbiome composition with factors such as age, BMI, gender, ethnicity, smoking status, use of antibiotics, and drinking water source. Additionally, we use null modelling to show that the microbial communities are subject to strong environmental pressure and dispersal limitation.\n\nLay SummaryWe analysed gut and oral microbes from healthy individuals in Pakistan and found that the potential for antibiotic resistance was increased in those who drank tap water.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are one of the most detrimental species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria worldwide. Phage therapy has emerged as an effective strategy for the treatment of infections caused by CPE pathogens. In west Japan, the increasing occurrence of Klebsiella pneumoniae harboring the pKPI-6 plasmid, which encodes blaIMP-6, is a growing concern. To manage such major antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, we isolated 29 novel phages from sewage in Japan, targeting 31 strains of K. pneumoniae and one strain of Escherichia coli harboring the pKPI-6 plasmid. Electron microscopy analysis indicated that of the 29 isolated phages, 21 (72.4%), 5 (17.2%), and 3 (10.3%) belonged to Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Podoviridae, respectively. Host range analysis revealed that 20 Myoviridae members in isolated phages infected 25-26 strains of K. pneumoniae, indicating that most of the isolated phages have a broad host range. The K. pneumoniae Kp21 can only be infected by phage oKp_21, while Kp22 can be infected by more than 20 phages. We applied a phage cocktail, which consists of 10 phages, against Kp21 and Kp22 and found that the phage cocktail delayed the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria for Kp21 strain but not for the Kp22 strain. Furthermore, phage-resistant Kp21 (Kp21r) became prone to be infected from other bacteriophages as a \"trade-off\" of resistance to phage oKp_21. Our proposed phage set has an adequate number of phages to combat the K. pneumoniae strain isolated in Japan. Notably, our work demonstrates how a suitable phage cocktail diminishes the occurrence of phage-resistant bacteria.\n\nImportanceKlebsiella pneumoniae harboring the plasmid carrying blaIMP-6 is becoming an increasingly hazardous species in Japan. We collected and characterized 29 novel bacteriophages that infect K. pneumoniae carrying the pKPI-6 plasmid, isolated in clinical settings of west Japan. Our phages showed broad host ranges. We applied a phage cocktail treatment constructed from 10 phages against two host strains, Kp21 and Kp22, which show different phage susceptibility patterns each other. Although the phage cocktail delayed phage-resistant Kp21 emergence, the emergence of phage-resistant Kp22 could not be delayed. Moreover, phage-resistant Kp21 became sensitive to other phages, which did not originally infect wild-type Kp21. Our study demonstrates how a suitable phage cocktail can diminish the occurrence of phage-resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Among the unfavorable conditions bacteria encounter within the host is restricted access to essential trace metals such as iron. To overcome iron deficiency, bacteria deploy multiple strategies to scavenge iron from host tissues with abundant examples of iron acquisition systems being implicated in bacterial pathogenesis. Yet, the mechanisms utilized by the major nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecalis to maintain intracellular iron balance are poorly understood. In this report, we conducted a systematic investigation to identify and characterize the iron acquisition mechanisms of E. faecalis and to determine their contribution to virulence. Bioinformatic analysis and literature surveys revealed that E. faecalis possesses three conserved iron uptake systems. Through transcriptomics, we discovered two novel ABC-type transporters that mediate iron uptake. While inactivation of a single transporter had minimal impact on the ability of E. faecalis to maintain iron homeostasis, inactivation of all five systems ({Delta}5Fe strain) disrupted intracellular iron homeostasis and considerably impaired cell growth under iron-deficiency. Virulence of the {Delta}5Fe strain was generally impaired in different animal models but showed niche-specific variations in mouse models, leading us to suspect that heme can serve as an iron source to E. faecalis during mammalian infections. Indeed, heme supplementation restored growth of {Delta}5Fe under iron-depletion and virulence in an invertebrate infection model. Collectively, this study reveals that the collective contribution of five iron transporters promotes E. faecalis virulence and that the ability to acquire and utilize heme as an iron source is critical to the systemic dissemination of E. faecalis.",

    "abstract": "The 3D chromatin architecture establishes a complex network of genes and regulatory elements necessary for transcriptomic regulation in development and disease. This network can be modeled by cis-regulatory hubs (CRH) which underscore the local functional interactions between enhancers and promoter regions and differ from other higher order chromatin structures such as topological associated domains (TAD). The Activity-by-contact (ABC) model of enhancer-promoter regulation has been recently used in the identification of these CRHs, but little is known about the role of CTCF on the ABC scores and the consequent impact on CRHs. Here we show that the loss of CTCF leads to a reorganization of the enhancer-promoter interactions resulting in a re-distribution of ABC scores of the putative enhancers in C57/bl6 mouse hearts. The loss of CTCF also leads to a global reduction of the total number of CRHs, and an increase in the size of the CRHs due to increase in the number of elements within each hub. In addition, CTCF loss led to more CRHs that cross TAD boundaries. These results provide another layer of evidence to support the importance of CTCF in the formation of regulatory networks necessary for gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "While experimental studies have demonstrated within-population variation in host tolerance to parasitism, theoretical studies rarely predict for polymorphism to arise. However, most theoretical models do not consider the crucial distinction between tolerance to the effects of infection-induced deaths (mortality tolerance) and tolerance to the parasite-induced reduction in the reproduction of infected hosts (sterility tolerance). While some studies have examined trade-offs between host tolerance and resistance mechanisms, none has considered a correlation within different tolerance mechanisms. We assume that sterility tolerance and mortality tolerance are directly traded-off in a host population subjected to a pathogen and use adaptive dynamics to study their evolutionary behaviour. We find that such a trade-off between the two tolerance strategies can drive the host population to branch into dimorphic strains, leading to coexistence of strains with sterile hosts that have low mortality and fully fertile with high mortality rates. Further, we find a wider range of trade-off shapes allows branching at intermediate or high infected population size. Our other significant finding is that sterility tolerance is maximised (and mortality tolerance minimised) at an intermediate disease-induced mortality rate. Additionally, evolution entirely reverses the disease prevalence pattern corresponding to the recovery rate, compared to when no strategies evolve. We provide novel predictions on the evolutionary behaviour of two tolerance strategies concerning such a trade-off.",

Analysis of STRs has many clinical uses, but is limited by technology mainly due to STRs surpassing the used read length. Nanopore sequencing, as one of long read sequencing technologies, produces very long reads, thus offering more possibilities to study and analyze STRs. Basecalling of nanopore reads is however particularly unreliable in repeating regions, and therefore direct analysis from raw nanopore data is required.\n\nResultsHere we present WarpSTR, a novel method for characterizing both simple and complex tandem repeats directly from raw nanopore signals using a finite-state automaton and a search algorithm analogous to dynamic time warping. By applying this approach to determine the lengths of 241 STRs, we demonstrate that our approach decreases the mean absolute error of the STR length estimate compared to basecalling and STRique.\n\nAvailabilityWarpSTR is freely available at https://github.com/fmfi-compbio/warpstr\n\nContactjozef.sitarcik@uniba.sk",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSequence logos can effectively visualize position specific base preferences evident in a collection of binding sites of some transcription factor. But those preferences usually fall far short of fully explaining binding specificity. Interestingly, some transcription factors bind sites of potentially methylated DNA. For example, MYC binds CpG sites. This may increase binding specificity as such sites are 1) highly under-represented in the genome, and 2) offer additional, tissue specific information in the form of hypo- or hyper-methylation. Fortunately, bisulfite sequencing data suitable to investigate this possibility is readily available.\n\nMethodWe developed MethylSeqLogo, an extension of sequence logos which adds DNA methylation information to sequence logos. MethylSeqLogo includes new elements to indicate DNA methylation and under-represented dimers in each position of a set of aligned binding sites. Our method displays information from both DNA strands, and takes into account the sequence context (CpG or other) and genome region (promoter versus whole genome) appropriate to properly assess the expected background dimer frequency and level of methylation.\n\nWhen designing MethylSeqLogo, we took care to preserve the usual sequence logo meaning of heights; in which the relative height of nucleotides within a column represents their proportion in the binding sites, while the absolute height of each column represents information (relative entropy) and the height of all columns added together represents total information.\n\nResultsWe present several figures illustrating the utility of using MethylSeqLogo to summarize data from CpG binding transcription factors. The logos show that unmethylated CpG binding sites are a feature of transcription factors such as MYC and ZBTB33, while some other CpG binding transcription factors, such as CEBPB, appear methylation neutral. We also compare MethylSeqLogo with two previously reported ways to create methylation aware sequence logos.\n\nConclusionsOur freely available software enables users to explore large-scale bisulfite and ChIP sequencing data sets -- and in the process obtain publication quality figures.",

    "abstract": "The prognosis and treatment of the patients suffering from Alzheimers disease (AD) have been one of the most important and challenging problems over the last few decades. To better understand the mechanism of AD, it is of great interest to identify genetic variants associated with brain atrophy. Commonly in these analyses, neuroimaging features are extracted based on one of many possible brain atlases with FreeSurf and other popular softwares, which however may lose important information due to our incomplete knowledge about brain function embedded in these suboptimal atlases. To address the issue, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) models applied to three-dimensional MRI data for the whole brain or multiple divided brain regions to perform completely data-driven and automatic feature extraction. These image-derived features are then used as endophenotypes in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to identify associated genetic variants. When applied to the ADNI data, we identified several associated SNPs which have been previously shown to be related to several neurodegenerative/mental disorders such as AD, depression and schizophrenia.

    "abstract": "Annotation of the mass signals is still the biggest bottleneck for the untargeted mass spectrometry analysis of complex mixtures. Molecular networks are being increasingly adopted by the mass spectrometry community as a tool to annotate large scale experiments. We have previously shown that the process of propagating annotations from spectral library matches on molecular networks can be automated using Network Annotation Propagation (NAP). One of the limitations of NAP is that the information for the spectral matches is only propagated locally, to the first neighbor of a spectral match. Here we show that annotation propagation can be expanded to nodes not directly connected to spectral matches using random walks on graphs, introducing the ChemWalker python library. Similarly to NAP, ChemWalker relies on combinatorial in silico fragmentation results, performed by MetFrag, searching biologically relevant databases. Departing from the combination of a spectral network and the structural similarity among candidate structures, we have used MetFusion Scoring function to create a weight function, producing a weighted graph. This graph was subsequently used by the random walk to calculate the probability of  walking through a set of candidates, departing from seed nodes (represented by spectral library matches). This approach allowed the information propagation to nodes not directly connected to the spectral library match. Compared to NAP, ChemWalker has a series of improvements, on running time, scalability and maintainability and is available as a stand alone python package.

While targeting mitochondrial {beta}-oxidation in prostate cancer (PCa) has gained significant attention in recent years, the contribution of peroxisomal {beta}-oxidation (perFAO) to PCa tumorigenesis is comparatively unexplored. Herein, we explored the therapeutic efficacy of targeting perFAO in PCa cells and clinical prostate tumours, and subsequently identified peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase 2 (DECR2), as a key therapeutic target. DECR2 is markedly upregulated in clinical PCa, most notably in metastatic castrate-resistant PCa. Depletion of DECR2 significantly suppressed proliferation, migration, and 3D growth of a range of CRPC and enzalutamide-resistant PCa cell lines, and inhibited LNCaP tumour growth and proliferation in vivo. Using transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses, we determined that DECR2 influences cell cycle progression and lipid metabolism to enable tumour cell proliferation. We further demonstrated a novel role for perFAO in driving resistance to standard-of-care androgen receptor pathway inhibition, using genetic and pharmacological approaches to alter DECR2/perFAO in treatment-resistant PCa cells. Our findings highlight a need to focus on peroxisomes to suppress tumour cell proliferation and reveal new therapeutic targets for advanced, treatment-resistant PCa.",

Exogenous application of 0.1 mM GHB to pop2 x ssadh, a double mutant incapable of catabolizing GABA, increased the endogenous GHB level by 13-fold compared to the wild type. The GHB dynamic studies by feeding and relieving from treatments showed that GHB is rapidly metabolized in wild type plants compared to the pop2 x ssadh double mutant. Although regarded as a short chain fatty acid, GHB level was not altered in mutants of the beta oxidation pathway following exogenous feeding. Therefore, the metabolism back to SSA and then TCA cycle appears to be the major route for GHB degradation.

Successful treatment of OCD is restricted by the limited knowledge about its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of OCD using electroencephalographic (EEG) event related potentials (ERP), elicited from multiple tasks to characterise disorder-related differences in underlying brain activity across multiple neural processes.\n\nMethodsERP data were obtained from 25 OCD patients and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) by recording EEG during Flanker and Go/Nogo tasks. Error-related negativity (ERN) was elicited by the Flanker task, while N200 and P300 were generated using the Go/Nogo task. Primary comparisons of the neural response amplitudes and the topographical distribution of neural activity were conducted using scalp field differences across all time points and electrodes.\n\nResultsCompared to HC, the OCD group showed altered ERP distributions. Contrasting with the previous literature on ERN and N200 topographies in OCD where fronto-central negative voltages were reported, we detected positive voltages. Additionally, the P300 was found to be less negative in the frontal regions. None of these ERP findings were associated with OCD symptom severity.\n\nConclusionsThese results indicate that individuals with OCD show altered frontal neural activity across multiple executive function related processes, supporting the frontal dysfunction theory of OCD. Furthermore, due to the lack of association between altered ERPs and OCD symptom severity, they may be considered potential candidate endophenotypes for OCD.",

Grounded cognition theories propose that concepts consist of perceptual-motor features represented in modality-specific perceptual-motor cortices. However, it is unclear whether conceptual processing consistently engages modality-specific areas. Here, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis across 212 neuroimaging experiments on conceptual processing related to 7 perceptual-motor modalities (action, sound, visual shape, motion, color, olfaction-gustation, and emotion). We found that conceptual processing consistently engages brain regions also activated during real perceptual-motor experience of the same modalities. In addition, we identified multimodal convergence zones that are recruited for multiple modalities. In particular, the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) are engaged for three modalities: action, motion, and sound. These \"trimodal\" regions are surrounded by \"bimodal\" regions engaged for two modalities. Our findings support a novel model of the conceptual system, according to which conceptual processing relies on a hierarchical neural architecture from modality-specific to multimodal areas up to an amodal hub.",

    "abstract": "Species and morphological diversity may be complementary but need not be linked. The evolution of sexual dimorphisms and polymorphisms may promote morphological diversification but not speciation. We tested this hypothesis in Papilio swallowtail butterflies (subgenus Menelaides) using a species-level molecular phylogeny, trait mapping, and diversification analyses. These butterflies show exceptional diversity in wing colour patterns with many sexually monomorphic, dimorphic, and polymorphic species. Ancestral trait mapping and trait evolution pathway analysis showed that non-mimetic monomorphism was ancestral, from which wing colour patterns had diversified following very few trait transitions among a large set of evolutionary paths. These evolutionary outcomes showed a degree of directional evolution from simpler sexually monomorphic wing patterns towards more complex sex-limited and sex-limited polymorphic mimicry, further enhancing morphological diversification. However, diversification analyses revealed that mimetic and non-mimetic clades had similar speciation and net diversification rates. Thus, mimicry has promoted morphological but not species diversification in Papilio, where the evolution of sexual dimorphism and polymorphism may have dampened the species diversification rates.",

The low-dimensional latent subspace that underlies large-scale neural dynamics and the relationships of these dynamics to cognitive and attentional states, however, are unknown. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging as human participants performed attention tasks, watched comedy sitcom episodes and an educational documentary, and rested. Whole-brain dynamics traversed a common set of latent states that spanned canonical gradients of functional brain organization, with global synchrony among functional networks modulating state transitions. Neural state dynamics were synchronized across people during engaging movie watching and aligned to narrative event structures. Neural state dynamics reflected attention fluctuations such that different states indicated engaged attention in task and naturalistic contexts whereas a common state indicated attention lapses in both contexts. Together, these results demonstrate that traversals along large-scale gradients of human brain organization reflect cognitive and attentional dynamics.",

    "abstract": "To navigate real-world listening conditions, the auditory system relies on the integration of multiple sources of information. However, to avoid inappropriate cross-talk between inputs, highly connected neural systems need to strike a balance between integration and segregation. Here, we develop a novel approach to examine how repeated neurochemical modules in the mouse inferior colliculus lateral cortex (LC) allow controlled integration of its multimodal inputs. The LC had been impossible to study via imaging because it is buried in a sulcus. Therefore we coupled two-photon microscopy with the use of a microprism to reveal the first-ever sagittal views of the LC to examine neuronal responses with respect to its neurochemical motifs under anesthetized and awake conditions. This approach revealed marked differences in the acoustic response properties of LC and neighboring nonlemniscal portions of the inferior colliculus. In addition, we observed that the module and matrix cellular motifs of the LC displayed distinct somatosensory and auditory responses. Specifically, neurons in modules demonstrated primarily offset responses to acoustic stimuli with enhancement in responses to bimodal stimuli, whereas matrix neurons showed onset response to acoustic stimuli and suppressed responses to bimodal stimulation. Thus, this new approach revealed that the repeated structural motifs of the LC permit functional integration of multimodal inputs while retaining distinct response properties.",

    "abstract": "Musical training can offset age-related decline in speech-in-noise perception. However, how lifelong musical expertise affects the functional reorganization of older brain in speech-in-noise perception has not yet been systematically investigated. Here, we address this issue by analyzing fMRI responses of older musicians, older non-musicians and, young non-musicians identifying noise-masked audiovisual syllables. First, we confirmed that older musicians outperformed older non-musicians and even equaled young non-musicians. Then, we showed that both older groups showed decreased auditory activation and increased visual activation compared to young non-musicians, while older musicians showed higher activation in speech motor regions and greater deactivation of default mode network (DMN) regions than older non-musicians. Next, we revealed that musical expertise counteracted the age-related neural dedifferentiation of speech representation, making older musicians exhibit higher neural alignment-to-young in bilateral sensorimotor areas. Finally, we disentangled that greater activation in speech motor areas and stronger deactivation in DMN regions were correlated with higher neural alignment in sensorimotor areas, which strongly predicted better performance in older adults. Together, long-term musical expertise mitigates age-related deficits in audiovisual speech-in-noise processing through enhanced compensatory scaffolding that reserves youth-like representation in sensorimotor areas. Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective on understanding age- and experience-related brain reorganization during speech perception.",

Considering the balance of costs and the detected number of novel viruses, an additional 3.89e+05 samples are required to capture 84% of the total genetic diversity. When analyzing the viral genetic diversity by taxonomy and ecosystem, the estimated viral genetic diversity were consistent with those mentioned above.\n\nConclusionsThis study for the first time explored the virus genome and protein space and estimated the total number of vOTUs and vPCs on earth when the virus genetic space was saturated.

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei, an etiological agent of African trypanosomiasis, colonizes the interstitial spaces of the adipose tissue in disproportionately high numbers, inducing a robust local immune response. Loss of body weight, including loss of adipose mass, is a hallmark symptom of African trypanosomiasis. Nevertheless, it is unclear which molecular mechanisms drive this loss of adipose mass and in turn whether it contributes to pathology. Here we show that lipolysis is activated early in infection in adipose tissue of T. brucei-infected mice. This activation is dependent on immune activation, as mice deficient for both B and T lymphocytes failed to upregulated adipocyte lipolysis upon infection and retained higher fat mass. Genetic ablation of the rate limiting adipose triglyceride lipase specifically from adipocytes in mice (AdipoqCre/+-Atglfl/fl) prevented the upregulation of adipocyte lipolysis during infection, leading to reduced loss of fat mass and adipocyte volume. Surprisingly infected AdipoqCre/+-Atglfl/fl mice succumbed earlier to infection and presented a higher parasite burden in the gonadal adipose tissue, indicating that lipolysis limits the growth of the parasite population. Collectively, this work provides molecular mechanistic insight into the loss of fat mass in African trypanosomiasis and identifies adipocyte lipolysis as a host-protective mechanism during a T. brucei infection.",

    "abstract": "Myofiber size regulation is critical in health, disease, and aging. MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) is a BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) co-receptor that promotes and shapes BMP signaling. MuSK is expressed at all neuromuscular junctions and is also present extrasynaptically in the slow soleus muscle. To investigate the role of the MuSK-BMP pathway in vivo we generated mice lacking the BMP-binding MuSK Ig3 domain. These {Delta}Ig3-MuSK mice are viable and fertile with innervation levels comparable to wild type. In 3-month-old mice myofibers are smaller in the slow soleus, but not in the fast tibialis anterior (TA). Transcriptomic analysis revealed soleus-selective decreases in RNA metabolism and protein synthesis pathways as well as dysregulation of IGF1-Akt-mTOR pathway components. Biochemical analysis showed that Akt-mTOR signaling is reduced in soleus but not TA. We propose that the MuSK-BMP pathway acts extrasynaptically to maintain myofiber size in slow muscle by promoting protein synthetic pathways including IGF1-Akt-mTOR signaling. These results reveal a novel mechanism for regulating myofiber size in slow muscle and introduce the MuSK-BMP pathway as a target for promoting muscle growth and combatting atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Organoid technology has provided us with a unique opportunity to study early human development and decipher various steps involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases. The technology is already used in clinics to improve human patient outcomes. However, limited knowledge of the methodologies required to establish organoid culture systems in domestic animals has slowed the advancement and application of organoid technology in veterinary medicine. Here, we have developed a platform to grow organoids from animal tissue samples and characterized oviductal organoids from five domestic animal species. Organoids were grown progressively from single cells derived from the enzymatic digestion of freshly collected equine, bovine, feline, canine, and porcine oviducts. The addition of WNT, TGFB, BMP, Rock, and Notch signalling pathway activators or inhibitors in the culture medium suggested remarkable conservation of the molecular signals involved in oviductal epithelial development and differentiation across species. The gross morphology of organoids from all the domestic species was initially similar. However, some differences in size, complexity, and growth rate were observed and described. Well-defined and synchronised motile ciliated cells were observed in differentiated organoids in mature populations. Histopathologically, oviductal organoids mimicked their respective native tissue. In summary, we have developed a detailed cross-species comparison of oviductal organoid models, which will be valuable for advancing assisted reproductive technologies and fertility studies in these animal species in the future.\n\nSummary sentenceOrganoids can be derived from the oviductal epithelium of cow, cat, dog, horse, and pig to advance assisted reproductive technologies in animals.",

    "abstract": "Animals alter their behavior in manners that depend on environmental conditions as well as their developmental and metabolic states. For example, C. elegans is quiescent during larval molts or during conditions of satiety. By contrast, worms enter an exploration state when removed from food. Sensory perception influences movement quiescence (defined as a lack of body movement), as well as the expression of additional locomotor states in C. elegans that are associated with increased or reduced locomotion activity, such as roaming (exploration behavior) and dwelling (local search). Here we find that movement quiescence is enhanced, and exploration behavior is reduced in G protein-coupled receptor kinase grk-2 mutant animals. grk-2 was previously shown to act in chemosensation, locomotion, and egg-laying behaviors. Using neuron-specific rescuing experiments, we show that GRK-2 acts in multiple ciliated chemosensory neurons to control exploration behavior. grk-2 acts in opposite ways from the cGMP-dependent protein kinase gene egl-4 to control movement quiescence and exploration behavior. Analysis of mutants with defects in ciliated sensory neurons indicates that grk-2 and the cilium-structure mutants act in the same pathway to control exploration behavior. We find that GRK-2 controls exploration behavior in an opposite manner from the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 and the neuropeptides FLP-1 and FLP-18. Finally, we show that secretion of the FLP-1 neuropeptide is negatively regulated by GRK-2 and that overexpression of FLP-1 reduces exploration behavior. These results define neurons and molecular pathways that modulate movement quiescence and exploration behavior.\n\nAuthor summaryMany modulatory neurotransmitters affect behavior by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and initiating signals that modify neuronal activity. GPCRs are regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRKs phosphorylate and promote the inactivation of GPCRs. Here we identify GRK-2 as a regulator of distinct locomotor states in C. elegans. We find that GRK-2 acts in olfactory sensory neurons to promote exploration and suppress movement quiescence. Additionally, we show that GRK-2 acts in opposition to a neuropeptide signaling pathway that acts in interneurons. Thus, this study demonstrates critical roles for GRK-2 in regulating neuromodulatory signaling and locomotor behavior.",

Endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) can directly repair damaged blood vessels and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of PAH. However, poor retention of ECFCs in the lungs following intravenous delivery greatly limits their therapeutic application. Therefore, we studied whether cellular microencapsulation could enhance ECFCs viability and retention in the lung after systemic delivery and improve therapeutic efficacy of ECFCs in a rat monocrotaline (MCT) PAH model.\n\nMethodsECFCs were encapsulated by vortex-emulsion using various concentrations of agarose, and capsule size and initial cell viability were assessed. Encapsulated and free ECFCs were transduced with luciferase and administered to Sprague-Dawley rats three days after injection of MCT. ECFCs were tracked in vivo by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to assess cell persistence and bio-distribution. At end-study, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and right ventricular hypertrophy were assessed for therapeutic efficacy.\n\nResultsMicrogel encapsulation using 3.5% agarose improved cells survival and supported cell migration from capsules. At 15 minutes after delivery, BLI radiance were similar for free and microencapsulated ECFCs; however, only encapsulated cells could be detected by BLI at 4 and 24 hours. Transplantation of microencapsulated ECFCs led to significant improvement in RVSP three weeks after delivery compared to non-encapsulated ECFCs.\n\nConclusionTogether, microencapsulation increased retention of ECFCs within the lungs. Furthermore, even a modest increase in ECFCs persistence over 24 hours can provide an important therapeutic benefit in the rat MCT model of PAH.",

Here, we demonstrate that clemastine, an over-the-counter drug for treating hay fever and allergy symptoms, effectively attenuated the stemness and suppressed the propagation of primary BTIC cultures bearing PDGFRA amplification. These effects on BTICs were accompanied by altered gene expression profiling indicative of their more differentiated states, resonating with the activity of clemastine in promoting the differentiation of normal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes. Functional assays for pharmacological targets of clemastine revealed that Emopamil binding protein (EBP), an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, is essential for BTIC propagation and a target that mediates the suppressive effects of clemastine. Finally, we showed that a neural stem cell-derived mouse glioma model displaying predominantly proneural features was similarly susceptible to clemastine treatment. Collectively, these results identify pathways essential for maintaining the stemness and progenitor features of GBMs, uncover BTIC dependency on EBP, and suggest that non-oncology, low-toxicity drugs with OPC differentiation-promoting activity can be repurposed to target GBM stemness and aid in their treatment.",

This study aimed to evaluate the mental demand and related-cortical activation patterns to eccentric and concentric cycling at matched perceived effort and torque.

The conditions 2-4 were randomised. After each condition, mental demand was monitored using the NASA Task Load Index scale. Changes in oxy-(O2Hb) and deoxy-(HHb) haemoglobin during exercise were measured over both prefrontal cortices and the right parietal lobe from a 15-probe layout using a continuous-wave NIRS system. Mental demand was significantly higher during eccentric compared to concentric cycling (+52%, p = .012) and when the exercise intensity was fixed by the torque rather than the perceived effort (+70%, p .001). For both torque- or perceived effort-matched exercises, O2Hb increased significantly (p < .001) in both prefrontal cortices and right parietal lobe, and HHb decreased in the left and right prefrontal cortices during eccentric compared to concentric cycling. The current study supports that acute eccentric cycling, compared to concentric cycling, involves a higher mental demand and frontoparietal network activation.",

    "abstract": "To divide, bacteria must synthesize and remodel their peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, a protective meshwork that maintains cell shape. FtsZ, a tubulin homolog, dynamically assembles into a midcell band, recruiting division proteins including the PG synthases FtsW and FtsI. FtsWI are activated to synthesize PG and drive constriction at the appropriate time and place, however their activation pathway remains unresolved. In Caulobacter crescentus, FtsWI activity requires FzlA, an essential FtsZ-binding protein. Through time-lapse imaging and single-molecule tracking of C. crescentus FtsW and FzlA in perturbed genetic backgrounds, we demonstrate that FzlA is a limiting constriction activation factor that converts inactive, fast-moving FtsW to an active, slow-moving state. We find that FzlA interacts with the DNA translocase FtsK, and place FtsK genetically in a pathway with FzlA and FtsWI. Misregulation of the FzlA-FtsK-FtsWI pathway leads to heightened DNA damage and cell death. We propose that FzlA integrates the FtsZ ring, chromosome segregation, and PG synthesis to ensure robust and timely constriction during Caulobacter division.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases disproportionately affect females more than males. The XX sex chromosome complement is strongly associated with susceptibility to autoimmunity. Xist long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is expressed only in females to randomly inactivate one of the two X chromosomes to achieve gene dosage compensation. Here, we show that the Xist ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, comprised of numerous autoantigenic components, is an important driver of sex-biased autoimmunity. Inducible transgenic expression of a non-silencing form of Xist in male mice introduced Xist RNP complexes and sufficed to produce autoantibodies. Male SJL/J mice expressing transgenic Xist developed more severe multiorgan pathology in pristane-induced model of lupus than wild-type males. Xist expression in males reprogrammed T and B cell population and chromatin states to more resemble wild type females. Human patients with autoimmune diseases displayed significant autoantibodies to multiple components of XIST RNP. Thus, a sex-specific lncRNA scaffolds ubiquitous RNP components to drive sex-biased immunity.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LITransgenic mouse models inducibly express Xist in male animals.\nC_LIO_LIXist expression in males induce autoantibodies and autoimmune pathology.\nC_LIO_LIXist in males reprograms T and B cell populations to female-like patterns.\nC_LIO_LIAutoantibodies to Xist RNP characterize female-biased autoimmune diseases.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Maintaining mitochondrial function is critical to an improved health span and lifespan. Introducing mild stress by inhibiting mitochondrial translation invokes the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and increases lifespan in several animal models. Notably, lower mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRP) expression also correlates with increased lifespan in a reference population of mice. In this study, we tested whether partially reducing the expression of a critical MRP, Mrpl54, reduced mitochondrial DNA-encoded protein content, induced the UPRmt, and affected lifespan or metabolic health using germline heterozygous Mrpl54 mice. Despite reduced Mrpl54 expression in multiple organs and a reduction in mitochondrial-encoded protein expression in myoblasts, we identified few significant differences between male or female Mrpl54+/- and wild type mice in initial body composition, respiratory parameters, energy intake and expenditure, or ambulatory motion. We also observed no differences in glucose or insulin tolerance, treadmill endurance, cold tolerance, heart rate, or blood pressure. There were no differences in median life expectancy or maximum lifespan. Overall, we demonstrate that genetic manipulation of Mrpl54 expression reduces mitochondrial-encoded protein content but is not sufficient to improve healthspan in otherwise healthy and unstressed mice.",

    "abstract": "Cell mechanics is determined by an intracellular biopolymer network, including intermediate filaments that are expressed in a cell-type specific manner. A prominent pair of intermediate filaments are keratin and vimentin as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is associated with a switch from keratin to vimentin. The transition coincides with a change in cellular mechanics, and thus dynamic properties of the cells. This observation raises the question of how the mechanical properties already differ on the single filament level. Here we use optical tweezers and a computational model to compare the stretching and dissipation behavior of the two filament types. We find that keratin and vimentin filaments behave in opposite ways: keratin filaments elongate, but retain their stiffness, whereas vimentin filaments soften, but retain their length. This finding is explained by fundamentally different ways to dissipate energy: viscous subunits sliding within keratin filaments and non-equilibrium  helix unfolding in vimentin filaments.",
