    "abstract": "A key function of the brain is to learn about the statistical relationships between events in the world. A mechanism of this learning is associative neural plasticity, controlled by the timing between neural events. Here, we show that experience can dramatically alter the timing rules governing associative plasticity to match the constraints of a particular circuit and behavior, thereby improving learning. In normal mice, the timing requirements for associative plasticity in the oculomotor cerebellum are precisely matched to the 120 ms delay for visual feedback about behavioral errors.1 This task-specific specialization of the timing rules for plasticity is acquired through experience; in dark-reared mice that had never experienced visual feedback about oculomotor errors, plasticity defaulted to a coincidence-based rule. Computational modeling suggests two broad strategies for implementing this Adaptive Tuning of the Timing Rules for Associative Plasticity (ATTRAP), which tune plasticity to different features of the statistics of neural activity. The modeling predicts a critical role of this process in optimizing the accuracy of temporal credit assignment during learning; consistent with this, behavioral experiments revealed a delay in the timing of learned eye movements in mice lacking experience-dependent tuning of the timing rules for plasticity. ATTRAP provides a powerful mechanism for matching the timing contingencies for associative plasticity to the functional requirements of a particular circuit and learning task, thereby providing a candidate neural mechanism for meta-learning.",

    "abstract": "SummaryHigh-throughput analysis of behaviour is a pivotal instrument in modern neuroscience, allowing researchers to combine modern genetics breakthrough to unbiased, objective, reproducible experimental approaches. To this extent, we recently created an open-source hardware platform (ethoscope (Geissmann et al., 2017)) that allows for inexpensive, accessible, high-throughput analysis of behaviour in Drosophila or other animal models. Here we equip ethoscopes with a Python framework for data analysis, ethoscopy, designed to be a user-friendly yet powerful platform, meeting the requirements of researchers with limited coding expertise as well as experienced data scientists. Ethoscopy is best consumed in a prebaked Jupyter-based docker container, ethoscope-lab, to improve accessibility and to encourage the use of notebooks as a natural platform to share post-publication data analysis.\n\nAvailability and implementationEthoscopy is a Python package available on GitHub and PyPi. Ethoscope-lab is a docker container available on DockerHub. A landing page aggregating all the code and documentation is available at https://lab.gilest.ro/ethoscopy.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors are enriched in immune-suppressive myeloid cells and are refractory to immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). Targeting epigenetic pathways to reprogram the functional phenotype of immune-suppressive myeloid cells to overcome resistance to ICT remains unexplored. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses of human GBM tumors demonstrated high expression of an epigenetic enzyme - histone 3 lysine 27 demethylase (KDM6B) in intra- tumoral immune-suppressive myeloid cell subsets. Importantly, myeloid-cell specific Kdm6b deletion enhanced pro-inflammatory pathways and improved survival in GBM tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the absence of Kdm6b enhances antigen-presentation, interferon response and phagocytosis in myeloid cells by inhibiting mediators of immune suppression including Mafb, Socs3 and Sirpa. Further, pharmacological inhibition of KDM6B mirrored the functional phenotype of Kdm6b deleted myeloid cells and enhanced anti-PD1 efficacy. Thus, this study identified KDM6B as an epigenetic regulator of the functional phenotype of myeloid cell subsets and a potential therapeutic target to improve response to ICT.",

    "abstract": "Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern challenge the efficacy of approved vaccines and emphasize the need for improved antigens. Using an evolutionary-based design approach starting from the widely used engineered Spike antigen, S-2P, we sought to increase antigen production levels and the exposure of highly conserved and neutralization sensitive receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes. Thirty-six prototypes were generated in silico, of which fifteen were produced and tested in biochemical assays. Design S2D14, which contains 20 mutations within the Spike S2 domain, showed a 6-fold increase in expression while preserving similar thermal stability and antigenicity as S-2P. Cryo-EM structures indicate that the dominant populations of S2D14 particles have RBDs in exposed states, and analysis of these structures revealed how modifications within the S2 domain balance trimer stability and RBD accessibility through formation and removal of hydrogen bonds and surface charge alterations. Importantly, vaccination of mice with adjuvanted S2D14 resulted in higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than adjuvanted S-2P against SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and four variants of concern. These results can guide the design of next generation vaccines to combat current, and future coronaviruses and the approaches used may be broadly applicable to streamline the successful design of vaccine antigens.",

    "abstract": "Outer surface protein C (OspC) plays a pivotal role in mediating tick-to-host transmission and infectivity of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borreliella burgdorferi. OspC is a helical-rich homodimer that interacts with tick salivary proteins, as well as components of the mammalian immune system. Several decades ago, it was shown that the OspC-specific monoclonal antibody, B5, was able to passively protect mice from experimental tick-transmitted infection by B. burgdorferi strain B31. However, B5s epitope has never been elucidated, despite widespread interest in OspC as a possible Lyme disease vaccine antigen. Here we report the crystal structure of B5 antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) in complex with recombinant OspC type A (OspCA). Each OspC monomer within the homodimer was bound by a single B5 Fab in a side-on orientation, with contact points along OspCs -helix 1 and -helix 6, as well as interactions with the loop between a-helices 5 and 6. In addition, B5s complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3 bridged the OspC-OspC homodimer interface, revealing the quaternary nature of the protective epitope. To provide insight into the molecular basis of B5 serotype specificity, we solved the crystal structures of recombinant OspC types B and K and compared them to OspCA. This study represents the first structure of a protective B cell epitope on OspC and will aid in the rational design of OspC-based vaccines and therapeutics for Lyme disease.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe spirochete, Borreliella burgdorferi, is the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, the most common tickborne disease in the United States. The spirochete is transmitted to humans during the course of a tick taking a bloodmeal. After B. burgdorferi is deposited into the skin of a human host, it replicates locally and spreads systemically, often resulting in clinical manifestations involving the central nervous system, joints, and/or heart. Antibodies directed against B. burgdorferis outer surface protein C (OspC) are known to block tick-to-host transmission, as well as dissemination of the spirochete within a mammalian host. In this report, we reveal the first atomic structure of one such antibody in complex with OspC. Our results have implications for the design of a Lyme disease vaccine capable to interfering with multiple stages in B. burgdorferi infection.",

    "abstract": "Modifications of histones are intricately linked with the regulation of gene expression, with demonstrated roles in various physiological processes and disease pathogenesis. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), implemented by the COMPASS family, is enriched at promoters and associated cis-regulatory elements, with H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) considered a hallmark of active gene promoters. However, the relative roles of deposition and removal of H3K4 methylation, as well as the extent to which these events contribute to transcriptional regulation have so far remained unclear. Here, through rapid depletion of the transcription regulator SPT5 or either of two shared subunits of COMPASS family members, we reveal a dynamic turnover of H3K4me3 mediated by the KDM5 family of histone demethylases. Loss of H3K4me3 following COMPASS disruption does not impair the recruitment of TFIID and initiating RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Instead, H3K4me3 loss leads to reductions in the paused form of Pol II on chromatin while inducing the relative enrichment of the Integrator-PP2A (INTAC) termination complex, leading to reduced levels of elongating polymerases, thus revealing how H3K4me3 dynamics can regulate Pol II pausing to sustain or attenuate transcription.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of sensitive plant species in calcareous grasslands are threatened by agricultural intensification with nutrient addition and increased livestock densities as well as by land abandonment. In order to quantify the effect of selected environmental and land-use factors on the observed variation and changes in the vegetation of calcareous grasslands, large-scale spatial and temporal pin-point plant cover monitoring data are fitted in a structural equation model. The analyzed vegetation data come from 100 Danish sites monitored over an eight year period. The important sources of measurement- and sampling uncertainties have been included using a hierarchical model structure. Furthermore, the measurement- and sampling uncertainties are separated from the process uncertainty, which is important when generating ecological predictions that may feed into local conservation management decisions. There were significant negative effects of grazing and nitrogen deposition on the change in cover of sensitive plant species. Whereas the negative effect of nitrogen deposition on the cover of sensitive species was expected, it was surprising that the model results suggest that the class of sensitive species may be subjected to overgrazing by the grazing regimes that are currently applied at protected Danish calcareous grasslands. The standardized regression coefficients suggest that the effects of both grazing and nitrogen deposition are relatively benign compared to the effects of soil type, soil pH and precipitation. The relatively large effect of precipitation is interesting, since it is predicted that the amount of precipitation and distribution over the season will change due to climate change, and the results suggest that climate change may lead to important species compositional changes in calcareous grasslands. The fitted model may be used to quantify the uncertainties when generating ecological forecasting and local adaptive management plans.",

    "abstract": "Ontogeny plays a key role in the evolution of organisms, as changes during the complex processes of development can allow for new traits to arise. Identifying changes in ontogenetic allometry - the relationship between skull shape and size during growth - can reveal the processes underlying major evolutionary transformations. Baleen whales (Mysticeti, Cetacea) underwent major morphological changes in transitioning from their ancestral raptorial feeding mode to the three specialised filter feeding modes observed in extant taxa. Heterochronic processes have been implicated in the evolution of these feeding modes, and their associated specialised cranial morphologies, but their role has never been tested with quantitative data. Here, we quantified skull shapes ontogeny and reconstructed ancestral allometric trajectories using 3D geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods on sample representing modern mysticetes diversity. Our results demonstrate that Mysticeti, while having a common developmental trajectory, present distinct cranial shapes from early in their ontogeny corresponding to their different feeding ecologies. Size is the main driver of shape disparity across mysticetes. Disparate heterochronic processes are evident in the evolution of the group: skim feeders present accelerated growth relative to the ancestral nodes, while Balaenopteridae have overall slower growth, or paedomorphosis. The grey whale is the only taxon with a relatively faster rate of growth in this group, which might be connected to its unique benthic feeding strategy. Reconstructed ancestral allometries and related skull shapes indicate that extinct taxa used less specialized filter feeding modes, a finding broadly in line with the available fossil evidence.",

    "abstract": "Individual pain sensitivity is influenced by many factors, such as the differentiation of brain regional features and genetic variations. However, its heritability remains largely unclear. The present study conducted a brain-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the genetic bases of structural and functional neuroimage phenotypes of pain sensitivity. In total 432 normal participants were firstly divided into high and low pain sensitivity groups according to laser quantitative test threshold and related brain regions gray matter density (GMD) features were identified. Consequently, GWAS was performed on each GMD phenotype using quality-controlled genotypes. Based on the heatmap and hierarchical clustering results from GWAS, the right insula was selected for further refined analysis in terms of sub-regions GMD and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) phenotypes. The results indicate that the right insula GMD in the high sensitivity group is significantly lower than the low sensitivity group. Also, the TT/TC group at locus rs187974 may lead to a lower GMD in the right insula than the CC group. Meanwhile, loci at gene CYP2D6 may lead to a variation of rs-FC between the right insula and left putamen. In conclusion, our study suggests multiple candidate loci associated with pain sensitivity that may influence brain phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Aggression is a common behavioral response to limited environmental resources. Most research on the neural basis of aggression in vertebrates focuses on adult males, where sex steroid hormones and the ventromedial hypothalamus are important regulators of aggressive behavior. However, the young of many species also display aggression, although the neural basis of juvenile aggression is not well understood. Here we examine juvenile aggression in Mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) tadpoles, who live in small isolated pools with limited resources and display aggressive behaviors towards intruder tadpoles. We first conducted a longitudinal study of dyadic behavior and found aggressive behavior increases with tadpole age. We next evaluated which brain regions may be important for tadpole aggression by quantifying pS6-positive cells as a proxy for neural activity. We found more pS6-positive cells in the ventral hypothalamus of aggressive tadpoles compared to controls, similar to findings in adult mammals. We then quantified colocalization of pS6 with vasopressin and oxytocin cells and found no difference across behavior groups. Based on this information, we hypothesized that similar brain regions, but different neuromodulators, may promote aggression in juvenile tadpoles compared to the literature in adult animals. We then used an untargeted approach to molecularly profile pS6-positive neurons and found enrichment of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene in aggressive tadpoles. As POMC is cleaved into several signaling peptides, we used pharmacology to target each pathway and discovered that blocking opioid receptors increases aggressive behavior. Together, this work suggests that POMC-derived B-endorphin is a negative regulator of juvenile aggression through the opioid receptor signaling. More broadly, this work suggests that similar brain regions, but different signaling molecules may be used to regulate aggression in adult and juvenile animals.",

    "abstract": "The foreign body response to implanted materials often complicates the functionality of sensitive biomedical devices. For cochlear implants, this response can reduce device performance, battery life and preservation of residual acoustic hearing. As a permanent and passive solution to the foreign body response, this work investigates ultra-low-fouling poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA) thin film hydrogels that are simultaneously photo-grafted and photo-polymerized onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The cellular anti-fouling properties of these coatings are robustly maintained even after six-months subcutaneous incubation and over a broad range of cross-linker compositions. On pCBMA-coated PDMS sheets implanted subcutaneously, capsule thickness and inflammation are reduced significantly in comparison to uncoated PDMS or coatings of polymerized poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (pPEGDMA) or poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA). Further, capsule thickness is reduced over a wide range of pCBMA cross-linker compositions. On cochlear implant electrode arrays implanted subcutaneously for one year, the coating bridges over the exposed platinum electrodes and dramatically reduces the capsule thickness over the entire implant. Coated cochlear implant electrode arrays could therefore lead to persistent improved performance and reduced risk of residual hearing loss. More generally, the in vivo anti-fibrotic properties of pCBMA coatings also demonstrate potential to mitigate the fibrotic response on a variety of sensing/stimulating implants.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518125v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d92121org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e2ca3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@948783org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ce647_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The application of B-cell epitope identification for the development of therapeutic antibodies is well established but consuming in terms of time and resources. For this reason, in the last few years, the immunoinformatic community has developed several computational predictive tools.\n\nWhile relatively successful, most of these tools only use a few properties of the candidate region to determine their likelihood of being a true B-cell epitope. However, this likelihood is influenced by a wide variety of protein features, including the presence of glycosylated residues in the neighbourhood of the candidate epitope, the subcellular location of the protein region or the three-dimensional information about their surface accessibility in the parental protein.\n\nIn this study we created Brewpitopes, an integrative pipeline to curate computational predictions of B-cell epitopes by accounting for all the aforementioned features. To this end, we implemented a set of rational filters to mimic the conditions for the in vivo antibody recognition to enrich the B-cell epitope predictions in actionable candidates. To validate Brewpitopes, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. In the S protein, Brewpitopes enriched the initial predictions in 5-fold on epitopes with neutralizing potential (p-value < 2e-4). Other than S protein, 4 out of 16 proteins in the proteome contain curated B-cell epitopes and hence, have also potential interest for viral neutralization, since mutational escape mainly affects the S protein. Our results demonstrate that Brewpitopes is a powerful pipeline for the rapid prediction of refined B-cell epitopes during public health emergencies.\n\nStatement of significanceWe have created Brewpitopes, a new pipeline that integrates additional important features such as glycosylation or structural accessibility, to curate B-cell epitope more likely to be functional in vivo. We have also validated Brewpitopes against SARS-CoV-2 not only for S protein but also for the entire viral proteome demonstrating that is a rapid and reliable epitope predictive tool to be implemented in present or future public health emergencies. Brewpitopes has identified 7 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in S and epitopes allocated in 4 other proteins. Overall, offering an accurate selection of epitopes that might be scaled up to the production of new antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Drug design based on their molecular kinetic properties is growing in application. Pre-trained molecular representation based on retrosynthesis prediction model (PMRRP) was trained from 501 inhibitors of 55 proteins and successfully predicted the koff values of 38 inhibitors for HSP90 protein from an independent dataset. Our PMRRP molecular representation outperforms others such as GEM, MPG, and common molecular descriptors from RDKit. Furthermore, we optimized the accelerated molecular dynamics to calculate relative retention times for 128 inhibitors of HSP90. We observed high correlation between the simulated, predicted, and experimental -log(koff) scores. Combining machine learning (ML) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation help design a drug with specific selectivity to the target of interest. Protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (IFPs) derived from accelerated MD further expedite the design of new drugs with the desired kinetic properties. To further validate our koff ML model, from the set of potential HSP90 inhibitors obtained by similarity search of commercial databases, we identified two novel molecules with better predicted koff values and longer simulated retention time than the reference molecules. The IFPs of the novel molecules with the newly discovered interacting residues along the dissociation pathways of HSP90 shed light on the nature of the selectivity of HSP90 protein. We believe the ML model described here is transferable to predict koff of other proteins and enhance the kinetics-based drug design endeavor.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) possess very low survival rate due to poor response to chemotherapy and late detection. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regarded as a major contributor to drive metastasis during NSCLC progression. Towards this, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-{beta}1) is the key driver that endows cancer cells with increased aggressiveness. Recently, our group synthesized a series of Schiff base quercetin derivatives (QDs) and ascertained their effectiveness on EMT markers of A549 cell line. Our study evidenced that EMT process was counteracted via the partial activation of a nuclear hormone receptor, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-{gamma} through QDs. Hence, here we extended our work to investigate the interplay between PPAR-{gamma} partial activation by synthesized QDs, TGF-{beta}1-induced EMT and migration in human lung cancer A549 cells. The results revealed that TGF-{beta}1 played a critical role in suppressing PPAR-{gamma}, which was markedly reversed and increased by partial agonists; QUE2FH and QUESH at both protein and transcriptional level. Compared to full agonists, rosiglitazone could not elevate PPAR-{gamma} expression in the presence of TGF-{beta}1 and had negligible effect on translocation of PPAR-{gamma} to nucleus. The partial agonists not only stimulated PPAR-{gamma} in balanced manner but also prevented the loss of E-cadherin and acquisition of TGF-{beta}1-induced mesenchymal markers (Snail, Slug, Vimentin and Zeb-1). Subsequently, the effects were accompanied by attenuation of TGF-{beta}1-induced migratory ability of A549 cells. Together, with the balanced activation profile of PPAR-{gamma} ligands, our findings suggest that these novel partial agonists may serve as potential anti-cancer agents to impede metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Plant acclimation to low temperatures occurs through system-wide mechanisms that include proteome shifts, some of which occur at the level of protein synthesis. All proteins are synthesised by ribosomes. Rather than being monolithic, transcript-to-protein translation machines, ribosomes can be selective and cause effective proteome shifts required for successful temperature acclimation. Here, we use apical root meristems of germinating seedlings of the monocotyledonous plant barley as a model to study changes in protein abundance and synthesis rates during cold acclimation. We measure metabolic and physiological parameters that allow us to compare protein synthesis rates in different physiological states, e.g., in cold acclimation compared to the optimal temperature state. We show that ribosomal proteins are independently synthesised and assembled into ribosomal complexes in root proliferative tissue, and assess how the ribo-proteome shifts during cold may be associated with changes in synthesis and accumulation of macromolecular complexes. We demonstrate that translation initiation is the limiting step during cold acclimation and based on our data propose a model of a ribosomal code that depends on a reconfigured ribosome population, where as a mode of cold acclimation, specific ribosomal protein compositions may confer selective association capabilities between 60S subunits and 48S initiation complexes.",

    "abstract": "SummaryGraphical analysis of the molecular structure of proteins can be very complex. Full atom representations retain most of the geometric information but are generally crowded and key structural patterns can be difficult to catch. Non-full atom representations could be more instructive on physicochemical aspects but be insufficiently detailed regarding shapes (e.g., entity beans-like models in coarse grain approaches) or individualistic properties of amino acids (e.g., representation of superficial electrostatic properties). TALAIA aims at providing another layer of structural representations. It is a visual dictionary where each amino acid is represented by a unique object with differentiated shapes and colors. It makes it easier to spot important molecular information including patches of amino acids or key interactions between side chains. Most of the conventions used in TALAIA are common in chemistry and biochemistry so that experimentalists and modelers can rapidly grasp the meaning of any TALAIA depictions.\n\nMotivationThe aim of the work is to offer a visual grammar that combines simplistic representations of amino acids while retaining their general geometry and physicochemical properties.\n\nResultsWe propose a tool that renders protein structures and encodes both structure and physicochemical aspects as a simple visual grammar. The approach is fast, highly informative, and simple, allowing the identification of possible interactions, hydrophobic patches, and other characteristic structural features at a simple glance.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/insilichem/talaia\n\nContactjeandidier.marechal@uab.cat",

    "abstract": "Stand-alone life science training events and e-learning solutions are amongst the most sought-after modes of training because they address both point-of-need learning and the limited timeframes available for  upskilling. Yet, finding relevant life sciences training courses and materials is challenging because such resources are not marked up for Internet searches in a consistent way. This absence of mark-up standards to facilitate discovery, re-use and aggregation of training resources limits their usefulness and knowledge-translation potential. Through a joint effort between the Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET), the Bioschemas Training community and the ELIXIR FAIR Training Focus Group, a set of Bioschemas Training profiles has been developed, published and implemented for life sciences training courses and materials. Here, we describe our development approach and methods, which were based on the Bioschemas model, and present the results for the three Bioschemas Training profiles: TrainingMaterial, Course and CourseInstance. Several implementation challenges were encountered, which we discuss alongside potential solutions. Over time, continued implementation of these Bioschemas Training profiles by training providers will obviate the barriers to skill development, facilitating both the discovery of relevant training events to meet individuals learning needs, and the discovery and re-use of training and instructional materials.",

    "abstract": "Neuroproteasomes are a subset of 20S proteasomes that are localized to the neuronal plasma membrane and degrade newly synthesized proteins. To date, the molecular composition of neuroproteasomes is undefined, and moreover, whether neuroproteasomes can influence protein aggregation with relevance to neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. Using a Cre-dependent conditional knock-in mouse line to endogenously tag the proteasome, we find that neuroproteasomes co-purify with ApoE, the most significant risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers Disease (AD). We discover that neuroproteasome membrane localization is differentially modulated by ApoE isoforms (E4<E3<E2) in vitro, in vivo, and in human postmortem samples. We synthesized selective, neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors and discovered that neuroproteasome inhibition induces aggregation of endogenous mouse and human Tau, without the need for seeding or pathogenic mutations. Using hApoE-KI/hTau-KI crosses, we find that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the aggregation threshold for Tau. Neuroproteasome inhibition in vivo is sufficient to induce sarkosyl-insoluble and Thioflavin-S positive endogenous Tau aggregates in only three days, which are completely abrogated by co-application of cycloheximide. Newly synthesized Tau levels increase threefold after neuroproteasome inhibition, leading us to posit that newly synthesized Tau is uniquely susceptible to aggregation due to neuroproteasome dysfunction. Overall, our data define neuroproteasomes as a pivotal proteostasis mechanism underlying the formation of endogenous Tau aggregates, which is directly regulated by the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers Disease.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), defined as the cerebral blood flow response to a vasoactive stimulus, is an imaging biomarker with demonstrated utility in a range of diseases and in typical development and aging processes. A robust and widely implemented method to map CVR involves using a breath-hold task during a BOLD fMRI scan. Recording end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) changes during the breath-hold task is recommended to be used as a reference signal for modeling CVR amplitude in standard units (%BOLD/mmHg) and CVR delay in seconds. However, obtaining reliable PETCO2 recordings requires equipment and task compliance that may not be achievable in all settings. To address this challenge, we investigated two alternative reference signals to map CVR amplitude and delay in a lagged general linear model (lagged-GLM) framework: respiration volume per time (RVT) and average gray matter BOLD response (GM- BOLD). In 8 healthy adults with multiple scan sessions, we compare spatial agreement of CVR maps from RVT and GM-BOLD to those generated with PETCO2. We define a threshold to determine whether a PETCO2 recording has \"sufficient\" quality for CVR mapping and perform these comparisons in 16 datasets with sufficient PETCO2 and 6 datasets with insufficient PETCO2. When PETCO2 quality is sufficient, both RVT and GM-BOLD produce CVR amplitude maps that are nearly identical to those from PETCO2 (after accounting for differences in scale), with the caveat they are not in standard units to facilitate between-group comparisons. CVR delays are comparable to PETCO2 with an RVT regressor but may be underestimated with the average GM- BOLD regressor. Importantly, when PETCO2 quality is insufficient, RVT and GM-BOLD CVR recover reasonable CVR amplitude and delay maps, provided the participant attempted the breath-hold task. Therefore, our framework offers a solution for achieving high quality CVR maps in both retrospective and prospective studies where sufficient PETCO2 recordings are not available and especially in populations where obtaining reliable measurements is a known challenge (e.g., children). Our results have the potential to improve the accessibility of CVR mapping and to increase the prevalence of this promising metric of vascular health.",

    "abstract": "This study reports an essential improvement of the method for replication of human norovirus (hNoV) with the use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. With three globally prevalent hNoV genotypes and P-types GII.2[P16], GII.4[P16], and GII.17[P31], we demonstrated that this tool had high efficiency and robustness, and enabled continuous virus passaging. This tool is versatile in being applied in hNoV related research. In pathogenesis study, the zebrafish embryo generated hNoVs showed clear binding patterns to human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) in human saliva by a simple saliva-binding reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In disinfection study, it was shown that a dose of 6 mJ/cm2 UV254 was able induce > 2-log reduction in hNoV infectivity for all three hNoV strains tested, suggesting that hNoVs were more UV susceptible than multiple enteric viruses and commonly used hNoV surrogates as tested before.\n\nIMPORTANCEHNoVs are a leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. The zebrafish embryo tool as developed in this study serves as an efficient way to generate viruses with high titers and clean background and a straightforward platform to evaluate hNoV inactivation efficacies. It is expected that this tool will not only benefit epidemiological research of hNoV but also be used to generate hNoV inactivation parameters which are highly needed by the water treatment and food industry.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThere is widespread interest in identifying genetic variants that exhibit parent-of-origin effects (POEs) wherein the effect of an allele on phenotype expression depends on its parental origin. POEs can arise from different phenomena including genomic imprinting and have been documented for many complex traits. Traditional tests for POEs require family data to determine parental origins of transmitted alleles. As most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) instead sample unrelated individuals (where allelic parental origin is unknown), the study of POEs in such datasets requires sophisticated statistical methods that exploit genetic patterns we anticipate observing when POEs exist. We propose a method to improve discovery of POE variants in large-scale GWAS samples that leverages potential pleiotropy among multiple correlated traits often collected in such studies. Our method compares the phenotypic covariance matrix of heterozygotes to homozygotes based on a Robust Omnibus Test. We refer to our method as the Parent of Origin Inference using Robust Omnibus Test (POIROT) of multiple quantitative traits.\n\nResultsThrough simulation studies, we compared POIROT to a competing univariate variance-based method which considers separate analysis of each phenotype. We observed POIROT to be well-calibrated with improved power to detect POEs compared to univariate methods. POIROT is robust to non-normality of phenotypes and can easily adjust for population stratification and other confounders. Finally, we applied POIROT to a GWAS of quantitative anthropometric measures at birth. We identified two loci of suggestive significance for follow-up investigation.",

    "abstract": "Synaptotagmin-1 is a vesicular protein and Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Ca2+ induces synaptotagmin-1 binding to its own vesicle membrane, called the cis-interaction, thus preventing the trans-interaction of synaptotagmin-1 to the plasma membrane. However, the electrostatic regulation of the cis- and trans-membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 was poorly understood in different Ca2+-buffering conditions. Here we provide an assay to monitor the cis- and trans-membrane interactions of synaptotagmin-1 by using native purified vesicles and the plasma membrane-mimicking liposomes (PM-liposomes). Both ATP and EGTA similarly reverse the cis-membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 in free [Ca2+] of 10 to 100 M. High PIP2 concentrations in the PM-liposomes reduce the Hill coefficient of vesicle fusion and synaptotagmin-1 membrane binding; this observation suggests that local PIP2 concentrations control the Ca2+-cooperativity of synaptotagmin-1. Our data provide evidence that Ca2+ chelators, including EGTA and polyphosphate anions such as ATP, ADP, and AMP, electrostatically reverse the cis-interaction of synaptotagmin-1.",

    "abstract": "Spatial perception of our hand is closely linked to our ability to move the hand accurately. We might therefore expect that reach planning would take into account any changes in perceived hand position; in other words, that perception and action relating to the hand should depend on a common sensorimotor map. However, there is evidence to suggest that changes in perceived hand position affect a body representation that functions separately from the body representation used to control movement. Here we examined target-directed reaching before and after participants either did (Mismatch group) or did not (Veridical group) experience a cue conflict known to elicit recalibration in perceived hand position. For the reaching task, participants grasped a robotic manipulandum that positioned their unseen hand for each trial. Participants then briskly moved the handle straight ahead to a visual target, receiving no performance feedback. For the perceptual calibration task, participants estimated the locations of visual, proprioceptive, or combined cues about their unseen hand. The Mismatch group experienced a gradual 70 mm forward mismatch between visual and proprioceptive cues, resulting in forward proprioceptive recalibration. Participants made significantly shorter reaches after this manipulation, consistent with feeling their hand to be further forward than it was, but reaching performance returned to baseline levels after only 10 reaches. The Veridical group, after exposure to veridically-aligned visual and proprioceptive cues about the hand, showed no change in reach distance. These results are not fully consistent with a single common sensorimotor map, but could suggest multiple, interacting body representations.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYIf perceived hand position changes, we might assume this affects the sensorimotor map and, in turn, reaches made with that hand. However, there is evidence for separate body representations involved in perception vs. action. After a cross-sensory conflict that results in proprioceptive recalibration in the forward direction, participants made shorter reaches as predicted, but only briefly. This is not fully consistent with a single common sensorimotor map, but could suggest multiple, interacting body representations.",

Maternal vaccination is an effective mechanism to protect both mother and neonate into post-partum. However, our understanding of passive transfer of antibodies elicited by maternal SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy remains incomplete.\n\nObjectiveWe aimed to evaluate the antibody responses engendered by maternal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following initial and booster doses in maternal circulation and breastmilk to better understand passive immunization of the newborn.\n\nStudy DesignWe collected longitudinal blood samples from 121 pregnant women who received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines spanning from early gestation to delivery followed by collection of blood samples and breastmilk between delivery and 12 months post-partum. During the study, 70% of the participants also received a booster post-partum. Paired maternal plasma, breastmilk, umbilical cord plasma, and newborn plasma samples were tested via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody levels.\n\nResultsVaccine-elicited maternal antibodies were detected in both cord blood and newborn blood, albeit at lower levels than maternal circulation, demonstrating transplacental passive immunization. Booster vaccination significantly increased spike specific IgG antibody titers in maternal plasma and breastmilk. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in newborn blood correlated negatively with days post initial maternal vaccine dose.\n\nConclusionVaccine-induced maternal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were passively transferred to the offspring in utero via the placenta and after birth via breastfeeding. Maternal booster vaccination, regardless of gestational age at maternal vaccination, significantly increased antibody levels in breastmilk and maternal plasma, indicating the importance of this additional dose to maximize passive protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection for neonates and infants until vaccination eligibility.",

Implementation of additional biological features further improved performance. Analyses of network dynamics uncovered a novel, powerful computational principle and provided plausible a posteriori explanations for features of natural networks whose computational role has remained elusive for a long time.

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe role of pain as a warning system necessitates a rapid transmission of information from the periphery for the execution of appropriate motor responses. The nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) is a physiological response to protect the limb from a painful stimulus and is often considered an objective measure of spinal nociceptive excitability. The NWR is commonly defined by its latency in the presumed Ad-fiber range consistent with the canonical view that \"fast pain\" is signaled by Ad nociceptors. We recently demonstrated that human skin is equipped with ultrafast (A{beta} range) nociceptors. Here, we investigated the short-latency component of the reflex and explored the relationship between reflex latency and pain perception.\n\nMethodsWe revisited our earlier work on NWR measurements in which, following convention, only those reflex responses were selected that were in the presumed Ad range (taken to be latencies [&ge;]90 ms in that study). In our current analysis, we expanded the time window to search for shorter latency responses and compared those with pain ratings.\n\nResultsIn both cohorts, we found an abundance of recordings with short-latency reflex responses. In nearly 90% of successful recordings, only single reflex responses (not dual) were seen which allowed us to compare pain ratings to reflex latencies. We found that shorter latency reflexes were just as painful as those in the conventional latency range.\n\nDiscussionWe found a preponderance of short-latency painful reflex responses. Based on this finding, we suggest that short-latency responses must be considered in future studies. We predict these might be signaled by the ultrafast nociceptors, warranting further investigation.",

In this present study, hub genes are identified and the top ten hub genes were used to identify drugs associated with them.

Genes associated with microRNAs were identified using miRWalk. Common genes from both miRWalk and the dataset GSE21942 were identified and were subjected to STRINGdb for the creation of a protein-protein interaction network and this network was then imported to Cytoscape for identifying the top ten hub genes. The top ten hub genes were subjected to EnrichR for enrichment analysis of genes. In our study, it was found that CTNNB1 is the gene with the highest degree (116).",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction, a form of compression, can simplify representations of information to increase efficiency and reveal general patterns. Yet, this simplification also forfeits information, thereby reducing representational capacity. Hence, the brain may benefit from generating both compressed and uncompressed activity, and may do so in a heterogeneous manner across diverse neural circuits that represent low-level (sensory) or high-level (cognitive) stimuli. However, precisely how compression and representational capacity differ across the cortex remains unknown. Here we predict different levels of compression across regional circuits by using random walks on networks to model activity flow and to formulate rate-distortion functions, which are the basis of lossy compression. Using a large sample of youth (n = 1, 040), we test predictions in two ways: by measuring the dimensionality of spontaneous activity from sensorimotor to association cortex, and by assessing the representational capacity for 24 behaviors in neural circuits and 20 cognitive variables in recurrent neural networks. Our network theory of compression predicts the dimensionality of activity (t = 12.13, p < 0.001) and the representational capacity of biological (r = 0.53, p = 0.016) and artificial (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) networks. The model suggests how a basic form of compression is an emergent property of activity flow between distributed circuits that communicate with the rest of the network.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have probed perceptual performance at different times after a self-paced motor action and found frequency-specific modulations of perceptual performance phase-locked to the action. Such action-related modulation has been reported for various frequencies and modulation strengths. In an attempt to establish a basic effect at the population level, we had a relatively large number of participants (n=50) perform a self-paced button press followed by a detection task at threshold, and we applied both fixed- and random-effects tests. The combined data of all trials and participants surprisingly did not show any significant action-related modulation. However, based on previous studies, we explored the possibility that such modulation depends on the participants internal state. Indeed, when we split trials based on performance in neighboring trials, then trials in periods of low performance showed an action-related modulation at {approx}17 Hz. When we split trials based on the performance in the preceding trial, we found that trials following a \"miss\" showed an action-related modulation at {approx}17 Hz. Finally, when we split participants based on their false-alarm rate, we found that participants with no false alarms showed an action-related modulation at {approx}17 Hz. All these effects were significant in random-effects tests, supporting an inference on the population. Together, these findings indicate that action-related modulations are not always detectable. However, the results suggest that specific internal states such as lower attentional engagement and/or higher decision criterion are characterized by a modulation in the beta-frequency range.",

However, the particular role of NREM2 and NREM3 sleep spindles and the mechanisms triggering this memory consolidation process remain controversial. Here, simultaneous electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings were collected during night-time sleep following the learning of a motor sequence task. Adopting a time-based clustering approach, we provide evidence that spindles iteratively occur within clustered and temporally organized patterns during both NREM2 and NREM3 sleep. However, the clustering of spindles in trains is related to motor memory consolidation during NREM2 sleep only. Altogether, our findings suggest that spindles clustering and rhythmic occurrence during NREM2 sleep may serve as an intrinsic rhythmic sleep mechanism for the timed reactivation and subsequent consolidation of motor memories, through synchronized oscillatory activity within a subcortical-cortical network involved during learning.",

Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation, whereas adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes during BBB formation and maintenance. Here we demonstrate that epigenetic regulators histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevented Wnt/{beta}-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. Low Wnt activity during development modifies BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveDravet syndrome (Dravet) is a rare and severe form of developmental epileptic encephalopathy. First-line treatment for DS patients includes valproic acid (VA) or clobazam with or without stiripentol (CLB+STP), while sodium channel blockers like carbamazepine (CBZ) or lamotrigine (LTG) are contraindicated. As patients are rarely seizure-free, drug therapy focuses on reducing the seizure burden, as reported by caregivers. In addition to their effect on epileptic phenotypes, antiseizure medications (ASMs) were shown to modify the properties of background neuronal activity. Nevertheless, little is known about these background properties alternations in Dravet.\n\nMethodsUtilizing Dravet mice (DS, Scn1aA1783V/WT), we tested the acute effect of several ASMs on background electrocorticography (ECoG) activity and frequency of interictal spikes.\n\nResultsCompared to wild-type mice, background ECoG activity in DS had lower power and reduced phase coherence, which was not corrected by any of the tested ASMs. However, acute administration of Dravet-recommended drugs, including VA or a combination of CLB+STP, caused, in most mice, a reduction of frequency of interictal spikes, alongside an increase in the relative contribution of the beta frequency band. Conversely, CBZ and LTG increased the frequency of interictal spikes with no effect on background spectral properties. Moreover, we uncovered a correlation between the reduction in interictal spike frequency, the drug-induced effect on the power of background activity, and a spectral shift toward higher frequency bands.\n\nSignificanceThese data provide a comprehensive analysis of the effect of selected ASMs on the properties of background neuronal oscillations and highlight a possible correlation between their effect on epilepsy and background activity. Thus, examining these properties, following an acute administration, may be used as an additional tool for rapid evaluation of the therapeutic potential of ASMs.\n\nKey PointsO_LIReduced background power and phase coherence in Dravet mice\nC_LIO_LIDS-recommended medicines (VA, CLB+STP) increase the relative beta power\nC_LIO_LIDS-contraindicated drugs (CBZ, LTG) do not cause spectral changes\nC_LIO_LICorrelation between reduction in background power and interictal spike frequency\nC_LIO_LICorrelation between theta to beta bands ratio and interictal spike frequency\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Our current understanding of focal epilepsy is evolving as increasing evidence suggests that tissue abnormalities may extend beyond the focus. In adults, widespread structural changes remote from the putative epileptic focus have been demonstrated with MRI, predominantly using morphological markers. However, the underlying pathophysiology of these changes is unclear, and it is not known whether these result from ongoing disease processes or treatment-related side-effects, or whether they emerge earlier. Few studies have focused on children, who typically have shorter disease duration. Fewer still have utilised quantitative MRI, which may provide a more sensitive and interpretable measure of tissue microstructural changes.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to determine if there were common spatial modes of changes in cortical architecture in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and secondarily if changes were related to disease severity. To assess cortical microstructure, quantitative T1 and T2 relaxometry (qT1 and qT2) was measured in 89 children - 43 with drug-resistant focal epilepsy [age-range=4-18 years] and 46 healthy controls [age-range=2-18 years]. We assessed depth-dependent qT1 and qT2 values across the cortex, as well as their gradient of change across cortical depths. As a post-hoc analysis, we determined whether global changes seen in group analyses were driven by focal pathologies in individual patients. Finally, we trained a classifier using qT1 and qT2 gradient maps from patients with radiologically-defined abnormalities (MRI-positive) and healthy controls, and tested if this could classify patients without reported radiological abnormalities (MRI-negative).\n\nWe detected depth-dependent qT1 and qT2 increases in widespread cortical areas, likely representing loss of structure such as altered cortical stratification, gliosis, myelin and iron alterations, oedema-associated increases in free-water, or a combination of these. Changes did not correlate with disease severity measures, suggesting they may appear during cerebral development and represent antecedent neurobiological alterations. Using a classifier trained with MRI-positive patients and controls, sensitivity was 62% at 100% specificity on held-out MRI-negative patients and controls.\n\nOur findings suggest the presence of a potential imaging endophenotype of focal epilepsy, detectable irrespective of radiologically-identified abnormalities, and possibly evident at a pre-symptomatic disease stage.",

    "abstract": "Group decision-making is common in everyday life, whether a family is sharing a meal or a corporation is dividing profits. Research in economics on group decision-making has coalesced into a theory known as the tragedy of the commons, which states that resources are inevitably overused when shared by a group. However, even while multiple approaches to mitigating overuse of common resources have been put forward, notable counterexamples to the tragedy of the commons exist such that groups are ultimately able to avoid resource overuse. Development of a computerized paradigm amenable to behavioral modeling and simulation analyses could allow for exploration of whether resources will be overused in a given group of individuals and allow for the rapid testing of behavioral interventions designed to reduce instances of resource overuse. Using a newly developed group decision-making task, we studied how participants made decisions to utilize shared resources for the potential to receive a larger amount of money or conserve resources for a smaller amount of money. Using behavioral modeling, we found that valuation of resource overuse is most impacted only when an exceptionally small amount of resources are remaining. Using computational analyses, we were able to differentiate individual participants by both group earnings and self-reported social attitudes in ways that correlated with their willingness to utilize resources. These results signify the importance of individual differences in group composition regarding the tragedy of the commons, emphasizing the impact of the attitudes and behaviors of individual group members in predicting shared resource use.",

Here we describe the generation and characterization of IVX-411, a computationally designed, two-component virus-like particle (VLP) displaying the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) on its surface. Immunization of mice with IVX-411 generates neutralizing antibodies against the ancestral strain as well as three variants of concern. Neutralizing antibody titers elicited by IVX-411 are durable and significantly higher than those elicited by immunization with soluble RBD and spike antigens. Furthermore, immunization with IVX-411 is shown to be protective in a Syrian Golden hamster challenge model using two different strains of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these studies demonstrate that IVX-411 is highly immunogenic and capable of eliciting broad, protective immunity.",

    "abstract": "The biogeography of eukaryotes in drinking water systems is poorly understood relative to prokaryotes or viruses. A common challenge with studying complex eukaryotic communities from natural and engineered systems is that the metagenomic analysis workflows are currently not as mature as those that focus on prokaryotes or even viruses. In this study, we benchmarked different strategies to recover eukaryotic sequences and genomes from metagenomic data and applied the best-performing workflow to explore eukaryotic communities present in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs). We developed an ensemble approach that exploits k-mer and reference-based strategies to improve eukaryotic sequence identification from metagenomes and identified MetaBAT2 as the best performing binning approach for clustering of eukaryotic sequences. Applying this workflow on the DWDSs metagenomes showed that eukaryotic sequences typically constituted a small proportion (i.e., <1%) of the overall metagenomic data. Eukaryotic sequences showed higher relative abundances in surface water-fed and chlorine disinfected systems. Further, the alpha and beta-diversity of eukaryotes were correlated with prokaryotic and viral communities. Finally, a co-occurrence analysis highlighted clusters of eukaryotes whose presence and abundance in DWDSs is affected by disinfection strategies, climate conditions, and source water types.\n\nSynopsisAfter benchmarking tools and developing a dedicated consensus workflow for eukaryotic sequence detection in metagenomes, the experimental, environmental, and engineering factors affecting their biogeography in drinking water distribution systems were investigated\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518372v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae8423org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@653471org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5606b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d30cde_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

If the End TB 2030 strategy is to be achieved, additional drugs need to be identified and made available to supplement the current treatment regimen. In addition, drug resistance is a growing issue, leading to significantly lower treatment success rates, necessitating further drug development. Vanoxerine (GBR12909), a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, was recently identified as having anti-mycobacterial activity. Repurposing vanoxerine or its analogues to treat tuberculosis infections may allow a faster route to clinical use than novel drug discovery. However, its effects on Mycobacteria were not well characterised. Herein, we report vanoxerine as a disruptor of the membrane potential, inhibiting mycobacterial efflux and survival, with an undetectable level of resistance.

Here, we investigated the potential of adaptive sampling to enrich for Plasmodium DNA while sequencing unenriched patient blood samples on a minION device.\n\nResultsTo compare adaptive sampling versus regular sequencing, a dilution series consisting of 0% up to 100% P. falciparum DNA in human DNA was sequenced. Half of the flowcell channels were run in adaptive sampling mode, enriching for the P. falciparum reference genome, resulting in a 3.2 fold enrichment of P. falciparum bases on average. Samples with a lower concentration of parasite DNA had a higher enrichment potential. We confirmed these findings by sequencing two P. falciparum patient blood samples with common levels of parasitaemia (0.1% and 0.2%). The estimated enrichment was 3.9 and 5.8, which was sufficient to cover at least 97% of the P. falciparum reference genome at a median depth of 20 (highest parasitaemia) or 5 (lowest parasitaemia). A comparison of 38 drug resistance variants (WHO) obtained via adaptive sequencing or Sanger sequencing showed a high concordance between the two methods, suggesting that the obtained sequencing data is of sufficient quality to address common clinical research questions for patients with parasitaemias of 0.1% and higher.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that adaptive Nanopore sequencing has the potential to replace more time-consuming Plasmodium-enrichment protocols and sequence directly from patient blood, given further improvements in cost-efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, much effort has been dedicated to identifying effective antivirals against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A number of calpain inhibitors show excellent antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the viral main protease (Mpro), which plays an essential role in processing viral polyproteins. In this study, we found that calpain inhibitors potently inhibited the infection of a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but not Mpro. In contrast, calpain inhibitors did not exhibit antiviral activities towards the wild-type VSV with its native glycoprotein. Genetic knockout of calpain-2 by CRISPR/Cas9 conferred resistance of the host cells to the chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2 virus and a clinical isolate of wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, calpain-2 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell attachment by positively regulating the cell surface levels of ACE2. These results highlight an Mpro-independent pathway targeted by calpain inhibitors for efficient viral inhibition. We also identify calpain-2 as a novel host factor and a potential therapeutic target responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the entry step.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryThe eukaryotic genome is organized to enable the precise regulation of gene expression required for development. This organization is established during early development when the embryo transitions from a fertilized germ cell to the totipotent zygote. To understand the factors and processes that drive genomic organization, we focused on the pioneer factor GAGA factor (GAF) that is required for early embryonic development in Drosophila. GAF transcriptionally activates the zygotic genome and is localized to subnuclear foci. We show that this non-uniform distribution is driven by binding to the highly abundant GA-satellite repeats. At GA-repeats, GAF is necessary to form heterochromatin and silence transcription. Thus, GAF is required to establish both active and silent regions. We propose that foci formation enables GAF to have opposing transcriptional roles within a single nucleus. Our data support a model in which modulation of the subnuclear concentration of transcription factors acts to organize the nucleus into functionally distinct domains that are essential for the robust regulation of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles, the membrane of which fuses with the plasma membrane upon calcium influx. This membrane fusion reaction is driven by the formation of a tight complex comprising the plasma membrane SNARE proteins syntaxin-1a and SNAP-25 with the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin. The neuronal protein Munc18-1 forms a stable complex with syntaxin-1a. Biochemically, syntaxin-1a cannot escape the tight grip of Munc18-1, so formation of the SNARE complex is inhibited. However, Munc18-1 is essential for the release of neurotransmitters in vivo. It has therefore been assumed that Munc18-1 makes the bound syntaxin-1a available for SNARE complex formation. Exactly how this occurs is still unclear, but it is assumed that structural rearrangements occur. Here, we used a series of mutations to specifically weaken the complex at different critical positions in order to induce these rearrangements biochemically. Our approach was guided through sequence and structural analysis and supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequently, we created a homology model showing the complex in an altered conformation. This conformation presumably represents a more open arrangement of syntaxin-1a that permits the formation of SNARE complex to be initiated while still bound to Munc18-1. In the future, research should investigate how this central reaction for neuronal communication is controlled by other proteins.",

Here, we introduce a family of designed Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) pairs with near quantitative FRET efficiencies based on the reversible interaction of fluorescent proteins with a fluorescently labeled HaloTag. These FRET pairs enabled the straightforward design of biosensors for calcium, ATP and NAD+ with unprecedented dynamic ranges. The color of each of these biosensors can be readily tuned by either changing the fluorescent protein or the synthetic fluorophore, which enabled to monitor simultaneously free NAD+ in different subcellular compartments upon genotoxic stress. Minimal modifications furthermore allow the readout of these biosensors to be switched to fluorescence intensity, lifetime or bioluminescence. These FRET pairs thus establish a new concept for the development of highly sensitive and tunable biosensors.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518186v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ae8b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@250477org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@482d03org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@833397_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Our results indicate that both CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins undergo conformational transitions along pathways unique to each protein. We have identified a number of key residues that form various inter-domain saltbridges, suggesting a multi-stage conformational change along the pathways. We have also constructed the free energy profiles along the transition pathways for both CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins. The CoV-2 spike protein must overcome larger free energy barriers to undergo conformational changes towards protein activation or deactivation, when compared to CoV-1.",

Our work proposes using Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, as a historiographical source for contemporary science. We chose the high-profile field of gene editing as our test case, performing a historical analysis of the English-language Wikipedia articles on CRISPR. Using a mixed method approach, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed its text, sections and references, alongside 50 affiliated articles. These, we found, documented CRISPRs maturation from a fundamental scientific discovery to a biotechnological revolution with vast social and cultural implications. We developed automated tools to support such research generically and demonstrated its applicability on two other scientific fields we have previously studied - COVID-19 and Circadian clocks. This method makes use of Wikipedia as a digital and free archive, documenting the incremental growth of knowledge and the manner scientific research accumulates and translates into public discourse. Using Wikipedia in this manner compliments and overcomes some issues with contemporary histories and can also augment existing bibliometric research.",

    "abstract": "The ability to regulate circuits and pathways is central to cellular control. The existing toolkit is predominantly comprised of local transcription regulators that are unsuitable for exerting control at a global genome-wide scale. Bacterial sigma factors are ideal global regulators as they direct the RNA polymerase to thousands of transcription sites. Here, we redesigned the promoter specificity of the E. coli housekeeping sigma factor, sigma-70, toward five orthogonal promoter targets not recognized by the native sigma-70. These orthogonal sigma-70s were engineered by screening a pooled library of computationally-guided designs customized toward each promoter target. A combination of conserved interactions with the DNA backbone and target-specific interactions facilitate new promoter recognition. Activity of the top performing redesigned sigma-70s varied across the promoter targets and ranged from 17% to 77% of native sigma-70 on its canonical active promoter. These orthogonal sigma factors represent a new suite of regulators for global transcriptional control.",

    "abstract": "RationalePatients with constitutive activation of DNA sensing pathway through stimulator of interferon genes (STING), such as those with STING-Associated Vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI), frequently have complications related to pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, the role of STING-signaling in adult PH patients is heretofore undescribed.\n\nObjectiveTo investigate the role of STING in PH development.\n\nMethods and ResultsPH was induced in global STING deficient or cell-specific STING deficient mice using either bleomycin or chronic hypoxia exposure. PH development was evaluated with right ventricular systolic pressure, Fulton index, histological and flow cytometric measurements. STING expression in patient lungs were examined using both immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Herein, we describe how STING overactivation in a SAVI mouse model results in a baseline elevation in pulmonary pressures, while global STING deficiency protects mice from PH development. Furthermore, STING-associated PH appears to be independent of type I Interferon (IFN) signaling. We further demonstrate a cellular dichotomous role of STING in PH development with STING expression by smooth muscle cells contributing to PH, and its activation on myeloid cells being pivotal in severe disease prevention. Finally, we demonstrate a STING-PD-L1 axis as necessary for disease progression, suggesting future potential therapeutic applications.\n\nConclusionsOverall, these data provide concrete evidence of STING involvement in PH, establishing biologic plausibility for STING-related therapies in PH treatment.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518422v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f5b50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143e485org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4fe1a4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66fe26_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Recent investigations reported induction of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, however, the molecular regulation and impact of NETosis on Mtb pathogenesis is unknown. We find that in response to Mtb infection in neutrophils, PAD4 citrullinates histones to decondense chromatin that gets packaged into vesicles for release as NETs in a manner that can maintain neutrophil viability and promote Mtb replication. Type I interferon, which has been associated with NETosis in numerous contexts but without a known mechanism, promotes formation of chromatin-containing vesicles and NET release. Analysis of nonhuman primate granulomas supports a model where neutrophils are exposed to type I interferon from macrophages as they migrate into the granuloma, where they release NETs that contribute to necrosis and caseation. Our data reveals NETosis as a promising target to inhibit Mtb replication and granuloma caseation.",

    "abstract": "Replication stress has been suggested to be an ultimate trigger of carcinogenesis. Oncogenic signal, such as overexpression of CyclinE, has been shown to induce replication stress. Here, we show that various biological stresses, including heat, oxidative stress, osmotic stress, LPS, hypoxia, and arsenate induce activation of Chk1, a key effector kinase for replication checkpoint. Some of these stresses indeed reduce the fork rate, inhibiting DNA replication. Analyses of Chk1 activation in the cell population with western analyses showed that Chk1 activation by these stresses is largely dependent on Claspin. On the other hand, single cell analyses with Fucci cells indicated that while Chk1 activation during S phase is dependent on Claspin, that in G1 is mostly independent of Claspin. We propose that various biological stresses activate Chk1 either directly by stalling DNA replication fork or by some other mechanism that does not involve replication inhibition. The former pathway predominantly occurs in S phase and depends on Claspin, while the latter pathway, which may occur throughout the cell cycle, is largely independent of Claspin.\n\nOur findings provide evidence for novel links between replication stress checkpoint and other biological stresses and points to the presence of unknown mechanisms of Chk1 activation in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "The Myc proto-oncogene contributes to the pathogenesis of more than half of human cancers. Malignant transformation by Myc transcriptionally upregulates the core pre-mRNA splicing machinery and causes mis-regulation of alternative splicing. However, our understanding of how splicing changes are directed by Myc is limited. We performed a signaling pathway-guided splicing analysis to identify Myc dependent splicing events. These included an HRAS cassette exon repressed by Myc across multiple tumor types. To molecularly dissect the regulation of this HRAS exon, we used antisense oligonucleotide tiling to identify splicing enhancers and silencers in its flanking introns. RNA binding motif prediction indicated multiple binding sites for hnRNP H and hnRNP F within these cis-regulatory elements. Using siRNA knockdown and cDNA expression, we found that both hnRNP H and F activate the HRAS cassette exon.\n\nMutagenesis and targeted RNA immunoprecipitation implicate two downstream G-rich elements in this splicing activation. Analyses of ENCODE RNA-seq datasets confirmed hnRNP H regulation of HRAS splicing. Analyses of RNA-seq datasets across multiple cancers showed a negative correlation of hnRNP H gene expression with Myc hallmark enrichment, consistent with the effect of hnRNP H on HRAS splicing. Interestingly, hnRNP F expression showed a positive correlation with Myc hallmarks and thus was not consistent with the observed effects of hnRNP F. Loss of hnRNP H/F altered cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Collectively, our results reveal new mechanisms for Myc-dependent regulation of splicing, and point to new possible therapeutic targets in prostate cancers.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATMENTMyc Transformation by the proto-oncogene c-Myc causes dysregulation of the pre-mRNA splicing reaction in cancer, but it is not known how mRNA isoform changes are directed by Myc. Here, we use bioinformatics to identify a splicing event in another proto-oncogene, HRAS, that is regulated by Myc across multiple tumor types. We identify new splicing regulators, hnRNPs H and F, that control this HRAS exon by binding to enhancer elements within its downstream intron. Additional pan-cancer bioinformatic analyses show hnRNP H expression to be anti- correlated with Myc hallmarks, consistent with the reduced splicing of the HRAS exon in Myc driven cancer. These findings uncover new mechanisms by which Myc can alter splicing in cancer cells and provide new molecular targets for potential therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "WRKY transcription factors are involved in plant defense responses against pathogens. However, no WRKYs have been reported yet in resistance of Nicotiana species to Alternaria alternata, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing brown spot disease. Here, we found that silencing NaWRKY3 lead to wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata highly susceptible to A. alternata. Combination of transcriptome, electrophoretic mobility shift, ChIP-qPCR and dual-LUC analyses, we uncovered that NaWRKY3 bound to many defense genes promoter and activated their expression. Target genes included: 1) lipoxygenases 3, ACC synthase 1 and ACC oxidase 1, three key enzyme genes for JA and ethylene biosynthesis which were critical for A. alternata resistance; 2) feruloyl-CoA 6-hydroxylase 1 (NaF6H1), the key enzyme gene for phytoalexins against A. alternata, scopoletin and scopolin; and 3) three A. alternata resistance genes, long non-coding RNA (LncRNA L2), NADPH oxidase (NaRboh D) and berberine bridge-like (NaBBL28). Silencing LncRNA L2 reduced A. alternata-induced levels of JA and NaF6H1 expression. NaRboh D-silenced plants were strongly impaired in ROS production and stomata closure responses. NaBBL28 was the first A. alternata resistance BBLs identified and was involved in HGL-DTGs hydroxylation. Finally, NaWRKY3 could bind to its own promoter but acted as a transcriptional repressor. Thus we demonstrated that NaWRKY3 is a fine-tuned master regulator of defense network against A. alternata in N. attenuata by regulating different signaling pathways and defense metabolites. For the first time, such an important WRKY was identified in Nicotiana species, providing new insight into defense mechanism of Nicotiana plants to A. alternata.",

It was better to identify the adulteration that has been added either inadvertently or deliberately during the process by designing single primers on housekeeping genes. In this paper, the fox meat was used as the experimental materials and the relationship between sample quality and copy number was established by extracting DNA and using DNA concentration as an intermediary. The results of ddPCR showed that both the relationships between meat weight and DNA concentration and between DNA concentration and DNA copy number (C) were nearly linear within the dynamic range. The DNA concentration was utilized as an intermediate value to establish the formulae about the relationship between the original meat weight and DNA copy number: Mfox=0.05C+2.7. The methods feasibility was validated using artificial adulteration of different proportions The establishment of this method provides technical support for relevant regulatory authorities to monitor the adulteration of fox meat.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancers represent a significant portion of cancer diagnoses, with head and neck cancer incidence increasing in some parts of the world. Typical treatment of early-stage head and neck cancers includes either surgery or radiotherapy; however, advanced cases often require surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Salivary gland damage following radiotherapy leads to severe and chronic hypofunction with decreased salivary output, xerostomia, impaired ability to chew and swallow, increased risk of developing oral mucositis, and malnutrition. There is currently no standard of care for radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction and treatment is often limited to palliative treatment that provides only temporary relief. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme that activates catabolic processes and has been shown to influence the cell cycle, proliferation, and autophagy. In the present study, we found that radiation (IR) treatment decreases tissue levels of phosphorylated AMPK following radiation and decreases intracellular NAD+ and AMP while increasing intracellular ATP. Further, expression of Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) were lower five days following IR. Treatment with AMPK activators, AICAR and metformin, attenuated compensatory proliferation (days 6, 7 and 30) following IR, and reversed chronic (day 30) salivary gland dysfunction post-IR. Additionally, treatment with metformin or AICAR increased markers of apical/basolateral polarity (phosphorylated aPKC{zeta}T560 positive area) and differentiation (amylase positive area) within irradiated parotid glands to levels similar to untreated controls. Taken together, these data suggest that AMPK may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment of radiation-induced salivary damage.",

NIPBL activates cohesins ATPase and is essential for loop extrusion, but its requirement for cohesin loading is currently unclear. Here we have examined the effect of reducing NIPBL levels on the behavior of the two cohesin variants carrying STAG1 or STAG2 by combining a flow cytometry assay to measure chromatin-bound cohesin with analyses of its genome-wide distribution and genome contacts. We show that NIPBL depletion results in increased cohesin-STAG1 on chromatin that further accumulates at CTCF positions while cohesin-STAG2 diminishes genome-wide. Our data support a model in which NIPBL is not required for initial association of cohesin with chromatin but it is for loop extrusion, which in turn facilitates stabilization of cohesin-STAG2 at CTCF positions after being loaded elsewhere. In contrast, cohesin-STAG1 is loaded and stabilized at CTCF sites even under low NIPBL levels, but genome folding is severely impaired.",

    "abstract": "Determining the identities, frequencies, and memberships of ecotypes in Prochlorococcus and other superabundant microbes (SAMs) is essential to studies of their evolution and ecology. This is challenging, however, because the extremely large population sizes of SAMs likely cause violations of foundational assumptions made by standard methods used in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. Here we present a tree-free likelihood method to identify ecotypes, which we define as populations with genome sequences whose high similarity is maintained by purifying selection. We applied the method to 96 genomes of the superabundant marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus and find that this sample is comprised of about 24 ecotypes, substantially more than the five major ecotypes that are generally recognized. The method presented here may prove useful with other superabundant microbes.",

Here with NanoTrans, we present an integrated computational framework that comprehensively covers all major DRS-based application scopes, including isoform clustering and quantification, poly(A) tail length estimation, RNA modification profiling, and fusion gene detection. In addition to its merit in providing such a streamlined one-stop solution, NanoTrans also shines in its workflow-orientated modular design, batch processing capability, rich tabular and graphic report outputs, as well as automatic installation and configuration support. Finally, by applying NanoTrans to real DRS datasets of yeast, Arabidopsis, as well as human embryonic kidney and cancer cell lines, we further demonstrated its utility, effectiveness, and efficacy across a wide range of DRS-based application settings.\n\nAvailability and implementationNanoTrans is written in bash, Perl, and R.

    "abstract": "Monocytes in the blood torrent, when activated by pro-inflammatory signals, adhere to the vascular endothelium and migrate into the tissue for ultimately differentiate into macrophages. Mechanics and adhesion play a crucial role in macrophage functions, such as migration and phagocytosis. However, how monocytes change their adhesion and mechanical properties upon differentiation into macrophages is still not well understood.\n\nIn this work, we combined atomic force microscopy (AFM) viscoelastic mapping with interference contrast microscopy (ICM) to simultaneously probe, at the single-cell level, viscoelasticity and adhesion during monocyte differentiation. THP-1 monocytic cells were differentiated into macrophages through phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Morphological quantification was achieved using holographic tomography imaging and the expression of integrin subunit CD11b was tracked as a marker of differentiation.\n\nHolographic tomography proved to be a quantitative in vivo technique, revealing a dramatic increase in macrophage volume and surface area and two subpopulations, spread and round macrophages. AFM viscoelastic mapping revealed an increased stiffness and more solid-like behavior of differentiated macrophages, especially in the lamellipodia and microvilli regions. Differentiated cells revealed an important increase of the apparent Youngs modulus (E0) and a decrease of cell fluidity ({beta}) on differentiated cells, which correlated with an increase in adhesion area. Macrophages with a spreading phenotype enhanced these changes. Remarkably, when adhesion was eliminated, differentiated macrophages remained stiffer and more solid-like than monocytes, suggesting a permanent reorganization of the cytoskeleton. We speculate that the more solid-like microvilli and lamellipodia might help macrophages to minimize energy dissipation during mechanosensitive activity, such as phagocytosis, making it more efficient. Our proposed approach revealed viscoelastic and adhesion hallmarks of monocyte differentiation that may be important for biological function.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is a common occurrence in ovarian carcinomas. Loss of the tumour suppressor PTEN in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is associated with a patient subgroup with poor prognosis. The cellular mechanisms of how PTEN loss contributes to HGSOC are largely unknown. We utilise long-term time-lapse imaging of HGSOC spheroids coupled to a machine learning approach to classify the phenotype of PTEN loss. PTEN deficiency does not affect proliferation but rather induces PI(3,4,5)P3-rich and -dependent membrane protrusions into the extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in a collective invasion phenotype. We identify the small GTPase ARF6 as a crucial vulnerability upon PTEN loss. Through a functional proteomic CRISPR screen of ARF6 interactors, we identify the ARF GTPase-activating protein (GAP) AGAP1 and the ECM receptor {beta}1-integrin (ITGB1) as key ARF6 interactors regulating the PTEN loss-associated invasion phenotype. ARF6 functions to promote invasion by controlling the recycling of internalised, active {beta}1-integrin complexes to maintain invasive activity into the ECM. The expression of the ARF6-centred complex in HGSOC patients is inversely associated with outcome, allowing identification of patient groups with improved versus poor outcome. ARF6 may represent a new therapeutic vulnerability in PTEN- depleted HGSOC tumours.",

The military and police force require ballistic armour to ensure the safety of their personnel, while the aerospace industry requires materials that enable the capture, preservation and study of hypervelocity projectiles. However, current industry standards display at least one inherent limitation. To resolve these limitations we have turned to nature, utilising proteins that have evolved over millennia to enable effective energy dissipation. Specifically, a recombinant form of the mechanosensitive protein talin was incorporated into a monomeric unit and crosslinked, resulting in the production of the first reported example of a talin shock absorbing material (TSAM). When subjected to 1.5 km/s supersonic shots, TSAMs were shown not only to absorb the impact, but to capture/preserve the projectile, making TSAMs the first reported protein material to achieve this.",

    "abstract": "The ability of bacterial pathogens to establish recurrent and persistent infections is frequently associated with their ability to form biofilms. Clostridioides difficile infections have a high rate of recurrence and relapses and it is hypothesised that biofilms are involved in its pathogenicity and persistence. Biofilm formation by C. difficile is still poorly understood. It has been shown that specific molecules such as deoxycholate (DCA) or metronidazole induce biofilm formation, but the mechanisms involved remain elusive. In this study, we describe the role of the C. difficile lipoprotein CD1687 during DCA-induced biofilm formation. We showed that the expression of CD1687, which is part of an operon within the CD1685-CD1689 gene cluster, is controlled by multiple transcription starting sites and some are induced in response to DCA. Only CD1687 is required for biofilm formation and the overexpression of CD1687 is sufficient to induce biofilm formation. Using RNAseq analysis, we showed that CD1687 affects the expression of transporters and metabolic pathways and we identified several potential binding partners by pull-down assay, including transport-associated extracellular proteins. We then demonstrated that CD1687 is surface exposed in C. difficile, and that this localization is required for DCA-induced biofilm formation. Given this localization and the fact that C. difficile forms eDNA-rich biofilms, we confirmed that CD1687 binds DNA in a non-specific manner. We thus hypothesize that CD1687 is a component of the downstream response to DCA leading to biofilm formation by promoting interaction between the cells and the biofilm matrix by binding eDNA.",

Here, we demonstrate a simple method for rapidly detecting bacteria and simultaneously determining their antibiotic susceptibility status. We demonstrate the method with E. coli, a high-impact pathogen, and meropenem, a member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics which is usually reserved for multi-drug resistant infections. Inclusion of a fluorogenic oligonucleotide substrate for endonuclease I, a well-conserved nuclease of the Enterobacteriaceae family, in a tryptic soy agar-based media enabled fluorescence-based detection of E. coli growth within 9 hours. Plating established carbapenem-resistant and -susceptible E. coli strains on this media with and without inclusion of meropenem, followed by fluorescent imaging yielded a clear phenotypic measure of the antibiotic susceptibility status of the strains in 9 hours. In addition to its simplicity and fast turnaround time, advantages of this approach include its ability to provide a measure of the bacterial load of the tested samples, and its easy integration into current microbiology laboratory workflows.",

To address this issue, we performed transcriptional profiling of fission yeast vtc4{Delta} cells, which lack the catalytic subunit of the Vtc4/Vtc2 polyphosphate polymerase complex and thus have no detectable intracellular PolyP. Deleting Vtc4 elicited the de-repression of four protein-coding genes - SPAC186.04c, gdt1/SPAC186.05, SPAC186.06, and SPAC750.01 - located within a sub-telomeric region of the right arm of chromosome I that is known to be transcriptionally silenced by the TORC2 complex.

Here, we report the early responses of murine lungs to nanoparticle-delivered PAMPs, specifically the RIG-I agonist poly-U/UC (PUUC), with or without the TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). Using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), we characterized the responses at 4 and 24 hours after intranasal administration. Within 4 hours, ribosome-associated transcripts decreased in both stromal and immune cells, followed by widespread interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Using RNA velocity, we show that lung-neutrophils dynamically regulate the synthesis of cytokines like CXCL-10, IL-1, and IL-1{beta}. Co-delivery of MPLA and PUUC increased chemokine synthesis and upregulated antimicrobial binding proteins targeting iron, manganese, and zinc in many cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Overall, our results elucidate the early PAMP-induced cellular responses in the lung and demonstrate that stimulation of the RIG-I pathway, with or without TLR4 agonists, induces a ubiquitous microbial defense state in lung stromal and immune cells.
