    "abstract": "Mapping the complex and dense arrangement of cells and their connectivity in brain tissue demands nanoscale spatial resolution imaging. Super-resolution optical microscopy excels at visualizing specific molecules and individual cells but fails to provide tissue context. Here we developed Comprehensive Analysis of Tissues across Scales (CATS), a technology to densely map brain tissue architecture from millimeter regional to nanoscopic synaptic scales in diverse chemically fixed brain preparations, including rodent and human. CATS leverages fixation-compatible extracellular labeling and advanced optical readout, in particular stimulated-emission depletion and expansion microscopy, to comprehensively delineate cellular structures. It enables 3D-reconstructing single synapses and mapping synaptic connectivity by identification and tailored analysis of putative synaptic cleft regions. Applying CATS to the hippocampal mossy fiber circuitry, we demonstrate its power to reveal the systems molecularly informed ultrastructure across spatial scales and assess local connectivity by reconstructing and quantifying the synaptic input and output structure of identified neurons.",

    "abstract": "Most human killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are expressed by Natural Killer (NK) cells and recognize HLA class I molecules as ligands. Uniquely, KIR3DL3 is a conserved but polymorphic inhibitory KIR recognizing a B7 family ligand, HHLA2, and is implicated for immune checkpoint targeting. Because the expression profile and biological function of KIR3DL3 remained elusive, we searched extensively for KIR3DL3 transcripts, revealing expression is highly enriched in {gamma}{delta} and CD8+ T cells rather than NK cells. These KIR3DL3 expressing cells are rare in the blood and thymus, but more common in the lungs and digestive tract. High resolution flow cytometry and single cell transcriptomics showed that peripheral blood KIR3DL3+ T cells have an activated transitional memory phenotype and are hypofunctional. The TCR usage is biased towards genes from early rearranged TCR- variable segments or V{delta}1 chains. Whereas we detected no impact of KIR3DL3 polymorphism on ligand binding, variants in the proximal promoter and at residue 86 can reduce expression. Together, we demonstrate that KIR3DL3 is upregulated in response to unconventional T cell stimulation and that individuals may vary in their ability to express KIR3DL3. These results have implications for the personalized targeting of KIR3DL3/HHLA2 checkpoint inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Marine symbioses are predominantly established through horizontal acquisition of microbial symbionts from the environment. However, genetic and functional comparisons of free-living populations of symbionts to their host-associated counterparts are sparse. Here, we assembled the first genomes of the chemoautotrophic gammaproteobacterial symbionts affiliated with the deep-sea snail Alviniconcha hessleri from two separate hydrothermal vent fields of the Mariana Back-Arc Basin. We used phylogenomic and population genomic methods to assess sequence and gene content variation between free-living and host-associated symbionts. Our phylogenomic analyses show that the free-living and host-associated symbionts of A. hessleri from both vent fields are populations of monophyletic strains from a single species. Furthermore, genetic structure and gene content analyses indicate that these symbiont populations are differentiated by vent field rather than by lifestyle. Together, this work suggests that, despite the potential influence of host-mediated acquisition and release processes on horizontally transmitted symbionts, geographic isolation and/or adaptation to local habitat conditions are important determinants of symbiont population structure and intra-host composition.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacteria diverge in a basic way from other bacterial and eukaryotic cells based on their distinct membrane structures. Here we report genome-wide transposon sequencing to discover the controllers of membrane compartmentalization in Mycobacterium smegmatis. cfa, a gene that encodes a putative cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase, shows the most significant effect on recovery from a membrane destabilizer, dibucaine. Lipidomic analysis of cfa deletion mutants demonstrates an essential role of Cfa in the synthesis of specific membrane lipids containing a C19:0 monomethyl-branched stearic acid. This molecule, also known as tuberculostearic acid (TBSA), has been intensively studied for decades due to its high level and genus-specific expression in mycobacteria. The proposed Cfa-mediated conversion of an unsaturation to a methylation matched well with its proposed role in lateral membrane organization, so we used new tools to determine the non-redundant effects of Cfa and TBSA in mycobacterial cells. cfa expression regulated major classes of membrane lipids including phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. Cfa localized within the intracellular membrane domain (IMD), where it controls both cellular growth and recovery from membrane fluidization by facilitating subpolar localization of the IMD. Overall, cfa controls lateral membrane partitioning but does not detectably alter orthogonal transmembrane permeability. More generally, these results support the proposed role of the subpolar IMD as a subcellular site of mycobacterial control of membrane function.\n\nSignificanceMycobacteria remain major causes of disease worldwide based in part on their unusual membrane structures, which interface with the host. Here we discover the long sought biosynthetic origin of tuberculostearic acid (TBSA), a major fatty acid found selectively in mycobacteria, as well as its role in mycobacterial cells. The lipid is produced by an enzyme called Cfa, whose loss causes a growth defect and slow reformation of a membrane domain near the pole of the rod-shaped cell. Thus, our study offers mechanistic insights to the intrinsic molecular factors critical for mycobacterial plasma membrane partitioning.",

    "abstract": "Cell competition is a developmental phenomenon that allows the selection of healthier cells in a developing tissue. In this process, cells with reduced fitness, conceivably due to harmful mutations, acquire the  loser status and are eliminated by the fitter (winner) neighboring cells via juxtacrine cell-cell interactions. How various mutations trigger cell competition is an extensively studied question. However, the mechanism of cell competition remains largely elusive. In this study, we reveal previously unknown functions of an ER and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in the regulation of cell competition in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Our data show that loss of Rer1 leads to the proteotoxic stress marked by the increased phosphorylation of eIF2. The increased proteotoxic stress in the rer1 mutant cells led to their elimination via cell competition. Interestingly, we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc overexpression, which generates super-competitive cells that overgrow at the expense of the normal neighboring cells. Loss of Rer1 also restricts the growth of Myc-induced super-competitive cells. Moreover, consistent with its known function as a negative regulator of the Notch pathway, our results show that the increased levels of Rer1 in Myc-overexpression led to the downregulation of Notch activity. In summary, these observations provide the first characterization of Rer1 in Drosophila and reveal its role in triggering cell competition via the regulation of proteotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary anthropogenic changes in climate and landscape form a complex set of selective pressures acting on natural systems, yet, in many systems, we lack information about both whether and how organisms may adapt to these changes. In plants, research has focused on climate-induced changes in phenology and the resultant potential for disruption of plant-pollinator interactions, however there remains a paucity of knowledge regarding how other pollinator-mediated traits may be involved in adaptive response. Here, we use resurrection experiments to investigate the phenotypic basis of adaptation in a mixed-mating system plant, the common morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea). Specifically, we measure temporal and spatial changes in traits grouped into three categories relevant to plant-pollinator interactions - floral morphology, floral rewards, and floral phenology. We show a significant temporal increase in corolla size and shift to earlier flowering times, as well as a potential for increased investment in floral rewards, all of which are driven primarily by populations at more northern latitudes. Additionally, we find evidence for directional selection on floral morphology and phenology, and evidence of balancing selection acting on anther-stigma distance. Overall, these results show an adaptive response in line with greater investment in pollinator attraction rather than self-pollination and fine-scale spatial differences in adaptive potential.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical research on mammals has traditionally neglected females, raising the concern that some scientific findings may generalize poorly to half the population. Although this lack of sex inclusion has been broadly documented, its extent within circadian genomics remains undescribed. To address this gap, we examined sex inclusion practices in a comprehensive collection of publicly available transcriptome studies on daily rhythms. Among 148 studies having samples from mammals in vivo, we found strong underrepresentation of females across organisms and tissues. Overall, only 23 of 123 studies in mice, 0 of 10 studies in rats, and 9 of 15 studies in humans included samples from females. In addition, studies having samples from both sexes tended to have more samples from males than from females. These trends appear to have changed little over time, including since 2016, when the US NIH began requiring investigators to consider sex as a biological variable. Our findings highlight an opportunity to dramatically improve representation of females in circadian research and to explore sex differences in daily rhythms at the genome level.",

    "abstract": "Empathy is an innate ability to understand the emotional states of others along with the motivation to improve it. It has evolved over time into highly complex behaviors, the basis of which can be described using the Perception Action Model (PAM), where shared affect promotes an action that eliminates the distress of both the passive \"Target\" and, by extension, the active \"Observer.\" There are myriad biological variables that may modulate empathic behavior, including sex, sensory modalities, and neural activity. In the following studies, using our labs model of social contact-independent targeted helping, we first tested whether sex differences exist in helping behavior. Next, we explored sex differences in sensory and affective signaling, including the impact of direct visualization of a distressed conspecific and the type of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) made between animal pairs during the task. Finally, we examined the neural activity of multiple cortical and subcortical regions of interest across time during targeted helping between males and females. We show both sexes exhibit similar helping behavior, but sensory and affective signaling differs between sexes. Further, changes in neural activity exhibited distinct sex-specific patterns across time. Our results indicate sex differences are not a ubiquitous presence in targeted helping. Instead, it is likely sex differences may be a convergent phenomenon in which the behavior is similar, but the underlying biological mechanisms are distinct. These results lay the groundwork for future studies to explore the similarities and differences that drive empathic behavior in both males and females.",

While we find some preliminary studies addressing the usage of these models in virtual screening, none of them focus on the prospect of hit-finding in a real-world virtual screen with a target with low sequence identity. In order to address this, we have developed an AlphaFiold2 version where we exclude all structural templates with more than 30% sequence identity. In a previous study, we used those models in conjunction with state of the art free energy perturbation methods. In this work we focus on using them in rigid receptor ligand docking. Our results indicate that using out-of-the-box Alphafold2 models is not an ideal scenario; one might think in including some post processing modeling to drive the binding site into a more realistic holo target model.",

By using the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database, we explored 79 complete genomes from 24 species of rickettsiae for putative antibiotic-resistant loci. There were 244 unique antibiotic-resistant genes in rickettsiae. Both the total and unique antibiotic-resistant genes in O. tsutsugamushi were significantly less compared to other members of rickettsiae.

    "abstract": "Most plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria harbor transcription activator-like effector (TALE) genes, which function as transcriptional activators of host plant genes and support infection. The entire repertoire of up to 29 TALE genes of a Xanthomonas strain is also referred to as TALome. The DNA-binding domain of TALEs is comprised of highly conserved repeats and TALE genes often occur in gene clusters, which precludes the assembly of TALE-carrying Xanthomonas genomes based on standard sequencing approaches. Here, we report the successful assembly of the 5 Mbp genomes of five Xanthomonas strains from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing data. For one of these strains, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) PXO35, we illustrate why Illumina short reads and longer PacBio reads are insufficient to fully resolve the genome. While ONT reads are perfectly suited to yield highly contiguous genomes, they suffer from a specific error profile within homopolymers. To still yield complete and correct TALomes from ONT assemblies, we present a computational correction pipeline specifically tailored to TALE genes, which yields at least comparable accuracy as Illumina-based polishing. We further systematically assess the ONT-based pipeline for its multiplexing capacity and find that, combined with computational correction, the complete TALome of Xoo PXO35 could have been reconstructed from less than 20,000 ONT reads. Our results indicate that multiplexed ONT sequencing combined with a computational correction of TALE genes constitutes a highly capable tool for characterizing the TALomes of huge collections of Xanthomonas strains in the future.",

    "abstract": "EmrE, a small multidrug resistance (SMR) transporter from E. coli, confers broad-spectrum resistance to polyaromatic cations and quaternary ammonium compounds. Previous transport assays demonstrate that EmrE transports a +1 and a +2 substrate with the same stoichiometry of 2 protons:1 cationic substrate. This suggests that EmrE substrate binding capacity is limited to neutralization of the two essential glutamates, E14A and E14B (one from each subunit in the antiparallel homodimer), in the primary binding site. Here we explicitly test this hypothesis, since EmrE has repeatedly broken expectations for membrane protein structure and transport mechanism. We previously showed that EmrE can bind a +1 cationic substrate and proton simultaneously, with cationic substrate strongly associated with one E14 residue while the other remains accessible to bind and transport a proton. Here we demonstrate that EmrE can bind a +2 cation substrate and a proton simultaneously using NMR pH titrations of EmrE saturated with divalent substrates, for a net +1 charge in the transport pore. Further, we find that EmrE can alternate access and transport a +2 substrate and proton at the same time. Together, these results lead us to conclude that E14 charge neutralization does not limit the binding and transport capacity of EmrE.",

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas and the primary cause of mortality in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). MPNSTs develop within pre-existing benign plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). PNs are driven solely by biallelic NF1 loss eliciting RAS pathway activation and respond favorably to MEK inhibitor therapy. Our analysis of genetically engineered and orthotopic patient-derived xenograft MPNST indicates that MEK inhibition has poor anti-tumor efficacy. By contrast, upstream inhibition of RAS through the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 reduced downstream signaling and suppressed NF1 MPNST growth, although resistance eventually emerged. To investigate possible mechanisms of acquired resistance, kinomic analyses of resistant tumors was performed, and data analysis identified enrichment of activated autophagy pathway protein kinases. Combining pharmacological blockade of autophagy and SHP2 inhibition resulted in durable responses in NF1 MPNSTs in both genetic and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Our studies can be rapidly translated into a clinical trial to evaluate SHP2 inhibition in conjunction with autophagy inhibitors as a novel treatment approach for NF1 MPNSTs.\n\nStatement of significanceCurrently, no effective therapies exist for MPNST. We demonstrate intrinsic MPNST resistance to MEKi monotherapy and identify SHP2 inhibition as an actionable vulnerability upstream of RAS. Furthermore, anti-tumor effects are extended and enhanced by dual exposure to autophagy pathway inhibition. Validation of these results as the most effective therapy to date in multiple genetically engineered models and in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts justify a clinical trial to evaluate SHP2i in conjunction with autophagy inhibitors as a novel treatment approach for NF1 MPNSTs.",

    "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) is an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan, with important roles in chronic inflammation, cancer and autoimmunity. 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a small molecule inhibitor of HA synthases, is widely used to study HAs interactions with the surrounding tissues and the immune cells. There is substantial experimental and therapeutic interest in using oral 4-MU to inhibit HA synthesis, but pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on treatment routes have been lacking. Moreover, it recently became clear that the main metabolite of 4-MU, 4-methlyumbelliferyl glucuronide (4-MUG), is bioactive. We therefore sought to define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 4-MU and its active metabolite 4-MUG in mice. Single dose mouse studies showed that 4-MU administered intravenously (i.v.) resulted in 100-fold higher 4-MU exposure compared to oral (p.o.) administration. The 4-MU ratio AUC i.v./AUC p.o. was 96/1. 4-MUG exposures were much higher than 4-MU exposures after both 4-MU i.v. and p.o. administration, but only small differences in 4-MUG exposure were seen after 4-MU i.v. versus p.o. administration. The 4-MUG metabolite was also administered as a single dose both i.v. and p.o. and showed a 25.9% bioavailability. Compared to 4-MUG p.o. dosing, 1.14 higher 4-MUG exposures were seen after 4-MU p.o. dosing. 4-MU exposure after 4-MUG p.o. administration was minimal but similar to 4-MU exposure after 4-MU p.o. administration. In mice treated for several weeks with 4-MU in chow, the 4-MU concentration immediately drops after treatment was stopped, whereas the 4-MUG concentration showed a peak 1 hour after treatment stop. In a build-up study, 4-MU and 4-MUG treatment in mice lead to a plateau of 4-MU concentration starting at 4 days post treatment start. These 4-MU and 4-MUG concentration findings in vivo will inform future clinical studies and experimental work with 4-MU.",

    "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs, including leucine, isoleucine, and valine) have emerged as major players in metabolic health and diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we report that BCAA catabolism drives adipogenesis via an intermediate metabolite of leucine and promotes subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) expansion during obesity. Genetic analyses of humans and mice reveal that the BCAA catabolic pathway in WAT is strongly correlated with adipose physiology and obesity traits. Altering BCAA catabolism in mature adipocytes exerts minor effects on adiposity in mice. However, enhancing adipose BCAA catabolism via FABP4-Cre-mediated Bckdk deletion promotes diet-induced obesity while blocking adipose BCAA catabolism through Bckdha ablation does the opposite. Intriguingly, the catabolism of BCAAs elicits fat depot-specific responses and promotes sWAT extension and adipogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, BCAA catabolism drives adipocyte differentiation via an intermediate metabolite of leucine, which activates mTORC1 and polyamine synthesis from methionine to promote the expression of adipogenic master regulators. Together, these results demonstrate that BCAA catabolism promotes adipogenesis and sWAT expansion during obesity. The crosstalk between leucine and methionine metabolism driven by the catabolic intermediate highlights an unexpected regulatory role of amino acids in metabolic health and diseases.",

Saccades are controlled by visuo-oculomotor regions and are known to impact medial temporal lobe processing, but the circuit dynamics in humans are unclear. Here, we asked which of the functional routes between the visual cortex, frontal eye fields, and the hippocampus facilitates memory encoding during visual exploration and whether saccades affect neural representations. Forty-eight human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and continuous monitoring of eye gaze while studying scenes and performing a recognition memory test thereafter. We discovered saccade-related excitatory coupling from the visual cortex and frontal eye fields towards the hippocampus, independent of memory. This was complemented by hippocampal inhibition of the visual cortex that determined whether participants would later remember or forget. Moreover, saccades were associated with overall stable but distinct hippocampal voxel patterns during memory formation and the degree of pattern distinctiveness positively scaled with inhibition along the hippocampus-to-visual cortex route. This suggests that eye movements are timed to the orchestration of circuit connectivity and neural representations, setting the stage for memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memory often involves high overlap between the actors, locations, and objects of everyday events. Under some circumstances, it may be beneficial to distinguish, or differentiate, neural representations of similar events to avoid interference at recall. Alternatively, forming overlapping representations of similar events, or integration, may aid recall by linking shared information between memories. It is currently unclear how the brain supports these seemingly conflicting functions of differentiation and integration. We used multivoxel pattern similarity analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data and neural-network analysis of visual similarity to examine how highly overlapping naturalistic events are encoded in patterns of cortical activity, and how the degree of differentiation versus integration at encoding affects later retrieval. Participants performed an episodic memory task in which they learned and recalled naturalistic video stimuli with high feature overlap. Visually similar videos were encoded in overlapping patterns of neural activity in temporal, parietal, and occipital regions, suggesting integration. We further found that encoding processes differentially predicted later reinstatement across the cortex. In visual processing regions in occipital cortex, greater differentiation at encoding predicted later reinstatement. Higher-level sensory processing regions in temporal and parietal lobes showed the opposite pattern, whereby highly integrated stimuli showed greater reinstatement. Moreover, integration in high-level sensory processing regions during encoding predicted greater accuracy and vividness at recall. These findings provide novel evidence that encoding-related differentiation and integration processes across the cortex have divergent effects on later recall of highly similar naturalistic events.",

    "abstract": "The CNS may produce the same endpoint trajectory or torque profile with different muscle activation patterns. What differentiates these patterns is the presence of co-contraction, which does not contribute to joint torque generation but allows to modulate mechanical impedance. Whether co-contraction is controlled through the same synaptic input to motor neurons involved in generating joint torque is still unclear. We hypothesized that co-contraction is controlled through a specific synaptic input, independent from that underlying the control of torque. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to concurrently generate multi-directional isometric forces at the hand and to modulate the co-contraction of arm muscles to displace and stabilize a virtual end-effector. The firings of motor units were identified through decomposition of High-Density EMGs collected from two antagonist muscles, Biceps Brachii and Triceps Brachii. We found significant peaks in the coherence between the neural drive to the two muscles, suggesting the existence of a common input modulating co-contraction across different exerted forces. Moreover, the within-muscle coherence computed after removing the component synchronized with the drive to the antagonist muscle or with the exerted force revealed two subsets of motor neurons that were selectively recruited to generate joint torque or modulate co-contraction. This study is the first to directly investigate the extent of shared versus independent control of antagonist muscles at the motor neuron level in a task involving concurrent force generation and modulation of co-contraction.\n\nSignificance StatementHow the CNS coordinates the activity of antagonist muscles to modulate limb mechanical impedance is still unclear. We hypothesized that a common synaptic input, shared by the motor neurons pools of antagonist muscles, and independent from the inputs underlying force generation, regulates co-contraction. We then analyzed the coherence between the firing trains of motor neurons to assess whether a common input drives antagonist muscles only during tasks requiring co-activation for impedance but not for force generation. Results highlighted the existence of separate neural pathways underlying the control of joint torque or impedance. Scientifically, this study addressed an important gap in understanding how neural drive is delivered to antagonist muscles, disentangling the control of muscles for joint torque or impedance modulation.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has associated alpha-band [8-12Hz] oscillations with inhibitory functions (Klimesch et al., 2007; Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010): for instance, several studies showed that visual attention increases alpha-band power in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the attended location (Thut et al., 2006; Handel et al., 2011). However, other studies demonstrated that alpha oscillations positively correlate with visual perception (Busch et al., 2009; Vanrullen and MacDonald, 2012), hinting at different processes underlying their dynamics. Here, using an approach based on traveling waves, we demonstrate that there are two functionally distinct alpha-band oscillations propagating in different directions. We analyzed EEG recordings from two datasets of human participants (N=32, both genders) performing a covert visual attention task. Participants were instructed to detect a brief target by covertly attending to the screens left or right side. Our analysis reveals two distinct processes: allocating attention to one hemifield increases top-down alpha-band waves propagating from frontal to occipital regions ipsilateral to the attended location, both with or without visual stimulation. These top-down oscillatory waves correlate positively with alpha-band power in frontal and occipital regions. Yet, different alpha-band waves propagate from occipital to frontal regions and contralateral to the attended location. Crucially, these forward waves were present only during visual stimulation, suggesting a separate mechanism related to visual processing. Together, these results reveal two distinct processes reflected by different propagation directions, demonstrating the importance of considering oscillations as traveling waves when characterizing their functional role.",

    "abstract": "Animals employ a neural system to map physical environmental position to neural activity and encode allocentric location. Grid cells, proposedly a vital component of this system, form a population code of space by firing in characteristic tessellated triangles of locations. This population code remaps across environments and behavioural states, independently of specific sensory inputs, pointing to a substrate of standard computation across environments, which many speculate to be path integration. However, testing whether these cells are crucial for path integration is outside the scope of current experiments and calls for complementary methods, possibly given by computational models. Recently, normative artificial neural network models have shown that path integration and grid-cell-like activity can be found in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to navigate in a simulated two-dimensional environment. Remarkably, the emergent spatial profile of these grid-like cells is similar to biological cell responses in that they set up a toroidal structure. Here, we extend the RNN normative model to multiple environments and show that cells that form the toroidal structure are crucial for path integration. However, cells selected through the grid cell score, a common defining property of grid cells, are much less important and comparable to randomly selected cells. Moreover, we show that the model can navigate multiple environments and that toroidal cells remap across environments in a biologically plausible way. Results demonstrate a causal relation between toroidal cells and path integration in virtual agents and propose a mechanism of remapping in grid cells based on remapping in place cells. The work is anticipated to impact both experimental and computational neuroscience and machine learning due to the methods employed and the evaluation of results. For example, we propose explicit experiments that can evaluate both the models validity and the role of grid cells in navigation. Moreover, the model may elucidate how high-dimensional data is mapped to low-dimensional structures, possibly providing a substrate for interpolation.",

    "abstract": "Both declarative and procedural memories are easier to reacquire than learn from scratch. This advantage, known as savings, has been widely assumed to result from the reemergence of stable long-term memories. In fact, the presence of savings has often been used as a marker for whether a memory had been consolidated. However, recent findings have demonstrated that motor learning rates can be systematically controlled, providing a mechanistic alternative to the reemergence of a stable long-term memory, and recent work has reported conflicting results about whether implicit contributions to savings in motor learning are present, absent, or inverted, suggesting a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In order to elucidate the mechanism responsible for savings in motor learning, we investigate the relationship between savings and long-term memory by determining how they depend on different components of motor learning. To accomplish this, we experimentally dissect motor adaptation based on short-term (1-minute) temporal persistence. Surprisingly, we find that a temporally-volatile component of implicit learning leads to savings whereas temporally-persistent learning does not, but that temporally-persistent learning leads to long-term memory at 24 hours whereas temporally-volatile learning does not. Moreover, we find that temporally-persistent implicit learning not only fails to contribute to savings, but that it produces an anti-savings which acts to reduce the net savings, and we show that the balance between temporally-volatile and temporally-persistent components can explain seemingly inconsistent reports about implicit savings. The clear double dissociation between the mechanisms for savings and long-term memory formation challenges widespread assumptions about the connection between savings and memory consolidation, and provides new insight into the mechanisms for motor learning.",

The mechanisms supporting working memory coding in the primate brain remain controversial. Here we demonstrate that microcircuits in layers 2/3 of the primate lateral prefrontal cortex dynamically represent memory content in a naturalistic task through sequential activation of single neurons. We simultaneously recorded the activity of hundreds of neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys during a naturalistic visuospatial working memory task set in a virtual environment. We found that the sequential activation of single neurons encoded trajectories to target locations held in working memory. Neural sequences were not a mere successive activation of cells with memory fields at specific spatial locations, but an abstract representation of the subjects trajectory to the target. Neural sequences were less correlated to target trajectories during perception and were not found during working memory tasks lacking the spatiotemporal structure of the naturalistic task. Finally, ketamine administration distorted neural sequences, selectively decreasing working memory performance. Our results indicate that neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex causally encode working memory in naturalistic conditions via complex and temporally precise activation patterns.",

    "abstract": "Although there is a plethora of modelling literature dedicated to the object recognition processes of the ventral (\"what\") pathway of primate visual systems, modelling studies on the motion sensitive regions like the Medial superior temporal area (MST) of the dorsal (\"where\") pathway are relatively scarce. Neurons in the MST area of the macaque monkey respond selectively to different types of optic flow sequences such as radial and rotational flows. We present three models that are designed to simulate the computation of optic flow performed by the MST neurons in primates. The first two models are each composed of 3 stages: the first stage comprises the Direction Selective Mosaic Network (DSMN), the second stage comprises the Cell Plane Network (CPNW) or the Hebbian Network (HBNW) and the third stage comprises the optic flow network (OF). The three stages roughly correspond to V1-MT-MST areas respectively in the primate motion pathway. Both these models are trained stage by stage using a biologically plausible variation of Hebbian learning. On the other hand, model-3 consists of the Velocity Selective Mosaic Network (VSMN) followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is trained using supervised backpropagation algorithm. We created various dot configurations that can move in translational, radial, and rotational trajectories to make training and test set. The simulation results show that, while neurons in model-1 and model-2 could account for MSTd cell properties found neurobiologically, model-3 neuron responses are consistent with the idea of functional hierarchy in the macaque motion pathway. These results also suggest that the deep learning models could offer a computationally elegant and biologically plausible solution to simulate the development of cortical responses of the primate motion pathway.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial decline is a key feature of ageing. The retina has more mitochondria than any other tissue and ages rapidly. To understand human retinal ageing it is critical to examine old world primates that have similar visual systems to humans, and do so across central and peripheral regions, as there is evidence for early central decline. Hence, we examine mitochondrial metrics in young and ageing Macaca fascicularis retinae. In spite of reduced ATP with age, primate mitochondrial complex activity did not decline. But mitochondrial membrane potentials were reduced significantly, and concomitantly, mitochondrial membrane permeability increased. The mitochondrial marker Tom20 declined significantly, consistent with reduced mitochondria number, while VDAC, a voltage dependent anion channel and diffusion pore associated with apoptosis increased significantly. In spite of these clear age-related changes, there was almost no evidence for regional differences between the centre and the periphery.\n\nPrimate cones do not die with age, but many showed marked structural decline with vacuous spaces in proximal inner segments normally occupied by endoplasmic reticulum (ER), that regulate mitochondrial autophagy. In many peripheral cones, ER was displaced by the nucleus that transposed across the outer limiting membrane and could become embedded in mitochondrial populations. These data are consistent with significant changes in retinal mitochondria in old world primate ageing but provide little if any evidence that aged central mitochondria suffer more than those in the periphery.",

We show here an analysis of structural determinants that likely underlie these differential effects on specific a-ketoglutarate (aKG)-dependent enzymes. Treatment of CD8+ T cells with exogenous S-2HG, but not R-2HG, increased CD8+ T cell fitness in vivo, and enhanced anti-tumour activity.

    "abstract": "As part of the first line of defense against pathogens, macrophages possess the ability to differentiate into divergent phenotypes with varying functions. The process by which these cells change their characteristics, commonly referred to as macrophage polarization, allows them to change into broadly pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) subtypes, and depends on the polarizing stimuli. Deregulation of macrophage phenotypes can result in different pathologies or affect the nature of some diseases, such as cancer and atherosclerosis. For this reason, it is necessary to better understand macrophage phenotype conversion in relevant models. However, there are few existing probes to track macrophage changes in multicellular environments. In this study, we generated an eGFP reporter cell line based on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNos) promoter activity in RAW264.7 cells (RAW:iNos-eGFP). iNos is associated with macrophage activation to pro-inflammatory states, and decreases in immune-suppressing ones. We validated the fidelity of the reporter for iNos, including following cytokine-mediated polarization, and confirmed that reporter and parental cells behaved similarly. RAW:iNos-eGFP cells were then used to track macrophage responses in different in vitro breast cancer models, and their re-education from anti- to pro-inflammatory phenotypes via a previously reported pyrimido(5,4-b)indole small molecule, PBI1. Using two mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines, 4T1 and EMT6, effects on macrophages were assessed via conditioned media, two-dimensional/monolayer co-culture, and three-dimensional spheroid models. While conditioned media derived from 4T1 or EMT6 cells and monolayer co-cultures of each with RAW:iNos-eGFP cells all resulted in decreased fluorescence, the trends and extents of effects differed. We also observed decreases in iNos-eGFP signal in the macrophages in co-culture assays with 4T1- or EMT6-based spheroids. We then showed that we are able to enhance iNos production in the context of these cancer models using PBI1, tracking increased fluorescence. Taken together, we demonstrate that this reporter-based approach provides a facile means to study macrophage responses in complex, multicomponent environments. Beyond the initial studies presented here, this platform can be used with a variety of in vitro models and extended to in vivo applications with intravital imaging.",

We hypothesise that the heterogeneous prevalence of pathobionts [e.g., adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC)], might explain this inconsistent NSAIDs/IBD correlation. Using IL10 -/- mice, we show aggravation of colitis in AIEC-colonised animals fed NSAID. This is accompanied by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, Caspase-8, apoptosis and pyroptosis; features not seen in mice exposed to AIEC or NSAID alone, revealing an AIEC/NSAID synergistic effect. Inhibition of NLRP3 or Caspase-8 activity ameliorated colitis, with reduction in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, cell death markers and activated T-cells and macrophages, improved histology and increased abundance of Clostridium cluster XIVa species. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how NSAID and an opportunistic gut-pathobiont can synergise to worsen IBD symptoms. Thus, targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome and Caspase-8 could be a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with NSAID-worsened inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Bi-specific T-cell engager antibodies (BITEs) are synthetic soluble molecules derived from antibodies that induce active contact between T-cells and other target cells in the body. BITE therapeutics have shown great promise for the treatment of various forms of cancer; however, the current development process for BITEs is time consuming and costly. BITE development requires empirical testing and characterization of the individual antigen binding domains, followed by extensive engineering and optimization in bi-specific molecular format to generate a molecule with strong biological activity and appropriate characteristics for clinical development. Here, we sought to create a cost efficient high-throughput method for creating and evaluating BITEs using a simplified function first approach to identify bioactive molecules without purification. Using a plasmid with a modular structure to allow high efficiency exchange of either binder arm, we established a simple method to combine many novel tumour-targeting single chain variable (scFv) domains with the well-characterized OKT3 scFv CD3-targeting domain. After generating these novel plasmids, we demonstrate two systems for high throughput functional screening of BITE molecules based on Jurkat T cells (referred to as BITE-J). Using BITE-J we evaluate four EGFRvIII BITEs, identifying two constructs with superior activity. We then confirmed this activity in primary T cells, where novel EGFRvIII-BITEs induced T cell activation and antigen selective tumor killing. We also demonstrate that we can similarly exchange the CD3-interacting element of our bi-modular plasmid. By testing several novel CD3-targeting scFv elements for activity in EGFRvIII-targeted BITEs, we were able to identify highly active BITE molecules with desirable properties for downstream development. In summary, BITE-J presents a low cost, high-throughput method for the rapid assessment of novel BITE molecules without the need for purification and quantification.",

    "abstract": "By consuming ammonium and nitrite, anammox bacteria form an important functional guild in nitrogen cycling in many environments including marine sediments. Recent studies have shown that anammox bacteria can consume most of the upwardly diffusing ammonium from deep anoxic sediments; however, their impact on the other important substrate nitrite has not been well characterized. Here we show niche partitioning of two anammox families emerges in a 2.4-m long mostly anoxic sediment core retrieved from the Nordic Seas. We document high abundances (~106 cells g-1) of anammox bacteria in most investigated sediment layers, with two distinct anammox abundance maxima in two nitrite consumption zones. Between the two anammox abundance maxima, nitrite accumulates as observed in other marine sediment sites and aquatic environments, indicating anammox bacteria play a fundamental role in modulating the nitrite distribution. Anammox bacteria in the upper nitrite consumption zone are dominated by the Candidatus Bathyanammoxibiaceae family, while Ca. Scalinduaceae family dominate at the lower zone. A high-quality representative Ca. Bathyanammoxibiaceae genome is recovered, which, comparing to Ca. Scalindua sediminis, the representative of Scalinduaceae in marine sediments, has fewer high-affinity ammonium transporters and lacks the capacity to access alternative substrates or energy sources such as urea and cyanate. These features may restrict Ca. Bathyanammoxibiaceae to conditions of higher ammonium concentrations or fluxes, and therefore drive the observed niche partitioning. These findings improve our understanding about nitrogen cycling in marine sediments by revealing the association between nitrite accumulation and niche partitioning of anammox bacteria.",

Our results follow from the statistical independence of low-count mutations, which we show to hold for the standard neutral coalescent or diffusion model of population genetics as well as for more general coalescent trees. For populations of constant size, these counts are given by the Ewens sampling formula. We develop a Poisson sampling model for populations of varying size, and illustrate it using new results for site-frequency spectra in an exponentially growing population. We apply our model to a large data set of human SNPs and use it to explain dramatic differences in site-frequency spectra across the range of mutation rates in the human genome.",

Determining the relative contributions of acclimation and adaptation is of central importance to understanding animal responses to change. Rates of evolution have traditionally been considered slow relative to ecological processes that shape biodiversity. Many organisms nonetheless show patterns of spatial genetic variation suggestive of adaptation and some evidence is emerging that adaptation can act sufficiently fast to allow phenotypic tracking in response to environmental change ( adaptive tracking). In Drosophila, both plastic and evolved differences in chill tolerance are associated with ionoregulation. Here we combine acclimation, latitudinal field collections, and a replicated field experiment to assess the effects of acclimation and adaptation on chill coma recovery and elemental (Na and K) stoichiometry in both sexes of Drosophila melanogaster. Acclimation and spatial adaptation both shape chill coma recovery, with acclimation producing the greatest magnitude response. Leveraging knowledge on the physiological mechanisms that underlie variation in chill tolerance traits, we find that the relationship between K content and chill tolerance differs among flies acclimated vs. adapted to cold. Taken together, these data reinforce the importance of acclimation in responses to abiotic challenges and illustrate that the mechanisms of phenotypic change can differ between acclimation and basal tolerance adaptation.",

The previous genome is of draft quality and partly based on the chicken (Gallus gallus) genome. A high-quality reference genome of Meleagris gallopavo is essential for turkey genomics and genetics research and the breeding industry.\n\nResultsBy adopting the trio-binning approach, we were able to assemble a high-quality chromosome-level F1 assembly and two parental haplotype assemblies, leveraging long-read technologies and genomewide chromatin interaction data (Hi-C). These assemblies cover 35 chromosomes in a single scaffold and show improved genome completeness and continuity. The three assemblies are of higher quality than the previous draft quality assembly and comparable to the current chicken assemblies (GRCg6a and GRCg7). Comparative analyses reveal a large inversion of around 19 Mbp on the Z chromosome not found in other Galliformes. Structural variation between the parent haplotypes were identified in genes involved in growth providing new target genes for breeding.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, we present a new high quality chromosome level turkey genome, which will significantly contribute to turkey and avian genomics research and benefit the turkey breeding industry.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells hold potential in repairing damaged tissue through paracrine effects. Their delivery though injectable biodegradable microbeads can improve cell retention and survival at the infusion site. A stirred emulsion process was previously implemented to immobilize these cells in injectable chitosan microbeads for cell therapy applications, but this process leads to broad bead size distribution (coefficient of variation > 40 %). Polydisperse beads may negatively affect the viability of the entrapped cells through oxygen limitations, damage to larger beads during injection, and reduced control over the cell payload and treatment reproducibility. The objective of this work was to modify a microchannel emulsification system initially designed for alginate-based encapsulation to immobilize mesenchymal stromal/stem cells in monodisperse chitosan microbeads. The main factors (e.g., microchannel geometry, chitosan solution viscosity, interfacial tension and flow rate) affecting droplet generation and diameter were investigated. The adapted process enabled the production of monodisperse chitosan microbeads with controlled sizes ranging from 600 {micro}m - 1500 {micro}m in diameter at a coefficient of variation less than 10 %. In a single pass through a 21 G syringe needle (ID: 513 {micro}m), the fraction of ruptured beads was significantly reduced for microchannel-generated vs stirred emulsion-generated beads with matching volume-weighed bead diameter (D[4,3]). The viability of the immobilized cells immediately after the process was 95 % {+/-} 2 % and no significant difference in cell survival and growth factor secretion was observed between microchannel and stirred emulsion-generated beads over 3 days of culture. Future directions include channel multiplexing to increase throughput for clinical applications. Although the device was developed for cell encapsulation, this process could be implemented for encapsulation of other biomolecules, bioactive or living cell agents for applications in the food and drug industry.",

    "abstract": "The RHO guanine exchange factor ARHGEF2 has exchange activity toward RHOA, which is essential for the development of cancers such as liver cancer. However, the potential functions and mechanisms of ARHGEF2 in the progression of liver cancer are largely unknown. In this study, we identified the transcriptional landscapes of hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with ARHGEF2 shRNAs. The gene enrichment assays such as KEGG and GO were used to further analyze the potential signaling pathways. Moreover, the PPI network and Reactome map were used to further identify the biological processes. The results showed that Alzheimers disease disease (AD) and Cushing syndrome (CS) are the major signaling pathways involved in the ARHGEF2-shRNAs treated hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We identified the top ten interactive genes including ICAM1, APOE, LDLR, NAT10, HSPA1A, EDN1, CACNA1C, KCNMA1, SNAI1, and ELN. Our study may provide novel mechanisms for the treatment of liver cancer by inhibiting ARHGEF2.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genetic variants associated with a particular phenotype. However, many complex phenotypes are influenced by multiple genetic variants with small effects. Detecting the genetic pleiotropy can provide insights into biological mechanisms influencing complex human phenotypes. The recently developed Multivariate Omnibus Statistical Test (MOSTest) has proven to be efficient and powerful, suited for complex large-scale data. The method substantially increased discovery of genetic variants associated with brain MRI phenotypes in the UK Biobank compared to conventionally use multivariate approach. Here we extend the MOSTest to meta-analysis (Meta-MOSTest), facilitating data analysis of multiple phenotypes across multiple cohorts. We evaluated our updated approach in the UK Biobank using brain MRI phenotypes, by comparing the discovery yield of the single-cohort MOSTest versus Meta-MOSTest through simulating sub-cohorts of different sample sizes from 265 to 26501 subjects.\n\nResultsOur method works efficiently on large-scale cohorts with a large number of MRI phenotypes. We found that lower per-cohort sample sizes resulted in a reduced discovery yield indicating a loss of statistical power. However, with a minimum sample size of 250 subjects across cohorts, Meta-MOSTest was equivalent to MOSTest on discovery yield while maintaining a well-calibrated type I error and equivalent statistical power. We conclude that Meta-MOSTest is a useful tool for multivariate analysis across separate brain imaging genetics cohorts.\n\nAvailability and implementationAll codes are freely available on GitHub: MOSTest and Meta-MOSTest.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most common malignancies, esophageal cancer has two subtypes, squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC), arising from distinct cells-of-origin. However, distinguishing cell-type-specific molecular features from cancer-specific characteristics has been challenging. Here, we analyze whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data on 45 esophageal tumor and nonmalignant samples from both subtypes. We develop a novel sequence-aware method to identify large partially methylated domains (PMDs), revealing profound heterogeneity at both the methylation level (depth) and genomic distribution (breadth) of PMDs across tumor samples. We identify subtype-specific PMDs, which are associated with repressive transcription, chromatin B compartments and high somatic mutation rate. While the genomic locations of these PMDs are pre-established in normal cells, the degree of loss is significantly higher in tumors. We find that cell-type-specific deposition of H3K36me2 may underlie the genomic distribution PMDs. At a smaller genomic scale, both cell-type- and cancer-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are identified for each subtype. Using binding motif analysis within these DMRs, we show that a cell-type-specific transcription factor such as HNF4A can maintain the binding sites that it establishes in normal cells, while being recruited to new binding sites with novel partners such as FOSL1 in cancer. Finally, leveraging pan-tissue single-cell and pan-cancer epigenomic datasets, we demonstrate that a substantial fraction of the cell-type-specific PMDs and DMRs identified here in esophageal cancer, are actually markers that co-occur in other cancers originating from related cell types. These findings advance our understanding of the DNA methylation dynamics at various genomic scales in normal and malignant states, providing novel mechanistic insights into cell-type- and cancer-specific epigenetic regulations.",

    "abstract": "We know little about mammalian anemotaxis, wind-sensing. Recently, however, Hartmann and colleagues showed whisker-based anemotaxis in rats. To investigate how whiskers sense airflow, we tracked whisker tips in anesthetized or cadaver rats under no airflow, low airflow and high (fan-blowing) airflow. Whisker tips showed little movement under no airflow conditions and all whisker tips moved during high airflow. Low airflow conditions - most similar to naturally occurring wind stimuli - engaged whisker tips differentially. Most whiskers moved little, the long supraorbital whisker showed maximal displacement and , A1, {beta}, and {gamma} whiskers also showed movements. The long supraorbital whisker differs from other whiskers in its exposed dorsal position, upward bending, length and thin diameter. Ex vivo extracted long supraorbital whiskers also showed exceptional airflow displacement, suggesting whisker-intrinsic biomechanics mediate the unique airflow-sensitivity. Micro computed tomography revealed that the ring-wulst - the follicle structure receiving the most sensitive afferents - was more complete/ closed in supraorbital and other wind-sensitive whiskers than in non-wind-sensitive whiskers, suggesting specialization of the supraorbital for omni-directional sensing. We localized and targeted the cortical supraorbital whisker representation in simultaneous Neuropixels recordings with D/E-row whisker barrels. Responses to wind-stimuli were stronger in the supraorbital whisker representation than in D/E-row barrel cortex. We assessed the behavioral significance of whiskers in an airflow-sensing paradigm. We observed that rats spontaneously turn towards airflow stimuli in complete darkness. Selective trimming of wind-responsive whiskers diminished airflow turning responses more than trimming of non-wind-responsive whiskers. Lidocaine injections targeted to supraorbital whisker follicles also diminished airflow turning responses compared to control injections. We conclude that supraorbital whiskers act as wind antennae.\n\nNew and NoteworthyAnimals rely on sensory processing of airflow (anemotaxis) to guide navigation and survival. We examined mechanisms of rat anemotaxis by combining whisker tracking, biomechanical analysis, micro computed tomography of follicle structure, Neuropixels recordings in the barrel field, behavior of airflow turning and whisker interference by trimming and lidocaine injections. This diversity of methods led to a coherent pattern of results. Whiskers greatly differ in their airflow sensitivity and strongly wind-responsive whiskers - in particular long supraorbital whiskers - determine behavioral responses to airflow stimuli in rats.",

    "abstract": "Under homeostatic conditions, epithelial cells remain non-migratory. However, during embryonic developmental and pathological processes, they become migratory. The mechanism underlying the transition between non-migratory and migratory epithelial cells is a fundamental question of cellular biology. In well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cell layers, non-migratory epithelial cells become migratory through an unjamming transition (UJT). We have previously identified the hallmarks of UJT: apical cell elongation and collective cellular migration. These indicate that UJT is driven by intercellular force modulation, but the nature of these forces in pseudostratified epithelia is unknown. Here, we identify structural characteristics of basal stem cells that are indicative of force generation. During the UJT, basal stem cells elongate and enlarge, and their stress fibers lengthen and align. These morphological changes in basal stem cells correspond to the previously defined hallmarks of the UJT. Moreover, basal cell elongation and stress fiber lengthening precedes apical cell elongation. Together, these structural changes in basal stem cells suggest that in pseudostratified airway epithelium, basal stem cells may be the origin of the traction forces through stress fiber modeling during the UJT.\n\nSummary StatementOur image analysis of pseudostratified airway epithelium reveals basal stem cells as the likely source of traction forces driving collective cellular migration during an unjamming transition.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblasts are spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells and an abundantly studied cell type that are easy to culture. Their adaptive response in culture conditions allows for use in many different cell biological experiments, including their utility in generating induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite extensive use of fibroblasts in cell and molecular biology and genetics experiments, fundamental evaluation of their resiliency and survival programs, in comparison with other cell types, is undetermined. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblasts exhibit remarkable survival capacity in post-mortem tissue decaying at room temperature and can be cultured from ear, tail tips, kidney, lung, fetal, and mammary tumor tissue after 12-hours of post-mortem tissue decay. Fibroblasts can be cultured from ear and lung tissue after 24-hours, and from ear after up to 120-hours of post-mortem tissue decay. Gene expression profiling of post-mortem lung tissue fibroblasts compared to fresh tissue cultured fibroblasts suggested a transition to a more quiescent phenotype with activation of nutrient scavenging pathways as evidenced by downregulation of genes associated with DNA replication, ribosomes, cell cycle, and spliceosomes as well as upregulation of genes associated metabolism, autophagy, and lysosomes. Measurement of light chain 3B (LC3B)-I/LC3B-II ratio and lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP)-1 indicate that autophagy is increased in post-mortem fibroblasts, with evidence for potential increase in autolysosomes and senescence program. Our study provides evidence for the ability of normal fibroblasts to overcome extreme stress conditions and offers new insights into cell survival mechanisms and aging, with potential utility in tissue regeneration and repair.",
