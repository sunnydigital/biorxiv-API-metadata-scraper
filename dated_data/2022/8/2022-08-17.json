    "abstract": "Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lentis (Fol) is the most devastating disease of lentil present worldwide and in India. Identification of multi-race fusarium wilt resistance genes and incorporation into existing cultivar will help to reduce yield loss. In the present study, a hundred lentil germplasm were screened against seven prevalent races of Fol and accession IC201561, EC714243 and EC718238 were identified resistant. The typical R gene codes for the nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRR) at the C terminal linked to either Toll/interleukin 1-like receptor (TIR) or coiled-coil (CC) at the N terminal. In the present study degenerate primers designed from the NBS region amplifying P-loop to GLPLA motif isolated forty-five resistance gene analogues (RGA) from identified resistant accessions. The sequence alignment identified both classes of RGA, TIR and non-TIR based on the presence of Aspartate (D) and Tryptophan (W) at the end of kinase motif respectively. The phylogenetic analysis grouped RGA into six classes, LRGA1 to LRGA6 determining the diversity of RGA present in the host. Grouping of RGA identified from Lens nigricans, LnRGA 2, 9, 13 with I2 reveals a probable role in Fusarium resistance. The similarity index of 27.85% to 86.98% was found among RGA and 26.83% to 49.41% between known R genes, I2, Gpa2, M and L6. Active binding sites present along the conserved motifs have grouped the RGA into 13 groups. ADP/ATP being the potential ligand determines ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis activity of RGA. The isolated RGA can be used in developing marker linked to the functional R gene. Further, expression analysis and full-length gene isolation further pave path to identifying the molecular mechanism involved in resistance.",

Largest prediction errors were found for the unbound fraction in plasma (>24-fold), clearance (178-fold) and half-life (90-fold) of UCN-01. Corresponding errors for clearance and half-life obtained with allometry were greater, 5800- and 145-fold, respectively. Extremely high affinity for alpha1-acid glycoprotein could explain these large prediction errors for this compound. A substantial amount of data and knowledge was added with the predictions.\n\nConclusionDespite challenging compounds and PK, predictions were comparably good.

    "abstract": "The liver is the major metabolic hub, ensuring appropriate nutrient supply during fasting and feeding. In obesity, accumulation of excess nutrients hampers proper liver function and is linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Understanding the signaling mechanisms that enable hepatocytes to quickly adapt to dietary cues, might help to restore balance in liver diseases. Post-translational modification by attachment of the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO), allows for a dynamic regulation of numerous processes including transcriptional reprograming. Here, we demonstrate that the specific SUMOylation of transcription factor Prox1 represents a nutrient-sensitive determinant of hepatic fasting metabolism. Prox1 was highly modified by SUMOylation on lysine 556 in the liver of ad libitum and re-fed mice, while this modification was strongly abolished upon fasting. In a context of diet-induced obesity, Prox1 SUMOylation became insensitive to fasting cues. Hepatocyte-selective knock in of a SUMOylation-deficient Prox1 mutant into mice fed a high fat/high fructose diet led to reduction of systemic cholesterol levels, associated with the induction of bile acid detoxifying pathways in mutant livers during fasting. As appropriate and controlled fasting protocols have been shown to exert beneficial effects on human health, tools to maintain the nutrient-sensitive SUMOylation switch on Prox1 may thus contribute to the development of \"fasting-based\" approaches for the maintenance of metabolic health.",

Although dopaminergic neurons (DANs) achieve this by driving associative learning, whether they contribute to assessment of sensory values outside the context of association remains largely unexplored. Here we show in Drosophila that DANs in the mushroom body encode the innate value of odors and constantly update the current value by inducing plasticity during olfactory navigation. Simulation of neuronal activity in a network based on the connectome data reproduced the characteristics of DAN responses, proposing a concrete circuit mechanism for computation. Notably, odors alone induced value- and dopamine-dependent changes in the activity of mushroom body output neurons, which store the current value of odors, as well as the behavior of flies steering in a virtual environment. Thus, the DAN circuit known for discrete, associative learning also continuously updates odor values during navigation in a non-associative manner.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is one of the major pathological events in age-related Parkinsons disease (PD) pathology, predominantly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). UPS essentially requires core component ubiquitin however, its role in PD pathology is obscure. This study aimed to investigate the role of ubiquitin encoding genes in the early phase of PD pathology. Wild-type human Myc--synuclein transfected neurons, -synuclein-PFFs treated cells, rotenone-induced sporadic models of PD and SNCA C57BL/6J-Tg (Th-SNCA*A30P*A53T)39 Eric/J transgenic mice showed downregulated level of UBA52 in conjunction with significant downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal death. In silico predictions, mass spectrometric analysis and co-immunoprecipitation findings suggested strong interaction of UBA52 with -synuclein, HSP90 and E3-ubiquitin ligase CHIP, besides its co-localization with -synuclein in the mitochondrion. Next, in vitro ubiquitylation assay indicated an imperative requirement of the lysine-63 residue of UBA52 in CHIP-mediated HSP90 ubiquitylation. Myc-UBA52 expressed neurons exhibited the downregulated -synuclein protein abundance with increased TH and restored proteasome activity during the diseased condition. Furthermore, Myc-UBA52 expression inhibited the augmented HSP90 protein level along with its various client proteins, HSP75 (homologue of HSP90 in mitochondrion) and ER stress-related markers during early PD. Taken together, data highlights the critical role of UBA52 in HSP90 ubiquitylation in parallel to its potential contribution to the modulation of various disease-related neurodegenerative signaling targets during the early phase of PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Multivalent antigen display is a well-established principle to enhance humoral immunity. Protein-based virus-like particles (VLPs) are commonly used to spatially organize antigens. However, protein-based VLPs are limited in their ability to control valency on fixed scaffold geometries and are thymus-dependent antigens that elicit neutralizing B cell memory themselves, which can distract immune responses. Here, we investigated DNA origami as an alternative material for multivalent antigen display in vivo, applied to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is the primary antigenic target of neutralizing antibody responses. Icosahedral DNA-VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a valency-dependent manner following sequential immunization in mice, quantified by pseudo-and live-virus neutralization assays. Further, induction of B cell memory against the RBD required T cell help, but the immune sera did not contain boosted, class-switched antibodies against the DNA scaffold. This contrasted with protein-based VLP display of the RBD that elicited B cell memory against both the target antigen and the scaffold. Thus, DNA-based VLPs enhance target antigen immunogenicity without generating off-target, scaffold-directed immune memory, thereby offering a potentially important alternative material for particulate vaccine design.",

Understanding the structure of the viral spike assists in determining the impact of mutations on the antigenic surface. One class of mutation impacts glycosylation attachment sites, which have the capacity to influence the antigenic structure beyond the immediate site of attachment. Here, we compare the glycosylation of a recombinant viral spike mimetic of the P.1 (Gamma) strain, which exhibits two additional N-linked glycan sites compared to the equivalent mimetic of the Wuhan strain. We determine the site-specific glycosylation of these variants and investigate the impact of these glycans by molecular dynamics. The N188 site is shown to exhibit very limited glycan maturation, consistent with limited enzyme accessibility. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics reveal that N188 is located within a cavity by the receptor binding domain, which influences the dynamics of these attachment domains. These observations suggest a mechanism whereby mutations affecting viral glycosylation sites have a structural impact across the antigenic surface.",

For parasitic diseases, VL has a mortality rate second only to malaria, and is associated with poverty-stricken areas of the world: primarily Brazil, East Africa and the Indian subcontinent (ISC). Miltefosine (MIL) and the antimonal sodium stibogluconate (SSG) are drugs used in the treatment of leishmaniasis. However, treatment efficacy is variable, and the numbers of reports of parasite resistance to both drugs have risen since their introductions, particularly in the ISC. To assess the level of parasite genotype contribution to drug resistance, we utilised the sequencing and associated drug susceptibility data from Imamura et al. (2016) to estimate heritability and GWAS using LDAK. We obtained strong heritability results, with mainly SNP/indel variations associated with SSG and copy number variants associated with MIL resistance, respectively. However, GWAS results were inconclusive, suggesting that, although the parasite genotype directly influences drug resistance, the effect might be multifactorial.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of COVID-19 disease have been extensively researched in many settings around the world, but little is known about these patterns in Africa. 6139 complete nucleotide genomes from 51 African nations were obtained and analyzed from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Global Initiative on Sharing Influenza Data (GISAID) databases to examine genetic diversity and spread dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Africa. We investigated their diversity using several clade and lineage nomenclature systems, and used maximum parsimony inference methods to recreate their evolutionary divergence and history. According to this study, only 193 of the 2050 Pango lineages discovered worldwide circulated in Africa after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, with five different lineages dominating at various points during the outbreak. We identified South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria as key sources of viral transmissions between Sub-Saharan African nations because they had the most SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled and sequenced. These results shed light on the evolutionary dynamics of the circulating viral strains in Africa. Genomic surveillance is one of the important techniques in the pandemic preparedness toolbox and to better understand the molecular, evolutionary, epidemiological, and spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, genomic surveillance activities across the continent must be expanded. The effectiveness of molecular surveillance as a method for tracking pandemics strongly depends on continuous and reliable sampling, speedy virus genome sequencing, and prompt reporting and we have to improve in all these aspects in Africa. Additionally, the pandemic breakout revealed that current land-border regulations aimed at limiting viruss international transmission are ineffective and a lot needs to be done to implement and improve our African land-borders as far as epidemiology is concerned in order to contain such outbreaks in the future.",

    "abstract": "Peritoneal metastases (PM) are one of the most common routes of dissemination for colorectal cancer (CRC) and remain a lethal disease with a poor prognosis. The compositional, mechanical and structural properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in cancer development; studying how these properties change during the progression of the disease is crucial to understand CRC-PM development.\n\nThe elastic properties of ECMs derived from human samples of normal and neoplastic PM in different pathological conditions were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM); results were correlated to patients clinical data and to the expression of ECM components related to metastatic spread.\n\nOur results show that PM progression is accompanied by stiffening of ECM as a common feature; spatially resolved mechanical analysis highlighted significant spatial heterogeneity of the elastic properties of both normal and neoplastic ECMs, which show significant overlap in the two conditions. On the micrometre scale, ECMs that are considered normal according to the pathological classification possess stiffer spatial domains, which are typically associated with cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) activity and tumour development in neoplastic matrices; on the other hand, softer regions are found in neoplastic ECMs on the same scales. Our results support the hypothesis that local changes (stiffening) in the normal ECM can create the ground for growth and spread from the tumour of invading metastatic cells.\n\nMechanical changes correlate well with the presence of CAF and an increase in collagen deposition, which are well known markers of cancer progression. Furthermore, we have found correlations between the mechanical properties of the ECM and patients clinical data like age, sex, presence of mutations in BRAF and KRAS genes and tumour grade.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that the mechanical phenotyping of the PM-ECM has the potential for predicting tumour development.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease (NTD) affecting both humans and animals. The morbidity and mortality inflicted upon livestock in sub-Saharan Africa has been largely overlooked, in part due to a lack of validated sensitive and specific tests, which do not require specialist training or equipment to deliver and interpret. Inexpensive, non-invasive, and sensitive diagnostic tests for livestock-use would also facilitate both prevalence mapping and appropriate intervention programmes. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the currently available point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen test (POC-CCA), designed for Schistosoma mansoni detection in humans, for the detection of intestinal livestock schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma bovis and Schistosoma curassoni. POC-CCA, together with the circulating anodic antigen (CAA) test, miracidial hatching technique (MHT) and organ and mesentery inspection (for animals from abattoirs only), were applied to samples collected from 195 animals (56 cattle and 139 small ruminants (goats and sheep) from abattoirs and living populations) from Senegal. POC-CCA sensitivity varied by ruminant group and by location/parasite species: sensitivity was greater in Barkedji (cattle: mean 81% (95% credible interval (CrI): 55%-98%); small ruminants: 49% (29%-87%), where livestock were primarily infected by S. curassoni, than in Richard Toll (cattle: 62% (41%-84%); small ruminants: 12% (1%-37%), where S. bovis was the main parasite species. Mean POC-CCA specificity across sites in small ruminants was 91% (77%-99%) with little variation between locations/parasites (Barkedji: 91% (73%-99%); Richard Toll: 88% (65% - 99%). Specificity could not be assessed in cattle owing to the low number of uninfected cattle surveyed. Overall, our results indicate that, whilst the current POC-CCA does represent a potential diagnostic tool for animal schistosomiasis, future work is needed to develop a livestock-specific affordable and field-applicable diagnostic tests to enable determination of the true extent of livestock schistosomiasis.\n\nAuthor summarySchistosomiasis is a debilitating neglected tropical and zoonotic disease, infecting over 230 million people and multiple millions of animals worldwide, most notably amongst the poorest regions and populations. The potential contribution of livestock schistosomiasis to disease transmission in human populations has implications for the design of effective disease management and elimination programmes. However, our understanding of the true prevalence, transmission and impact of animal schistosomiasis is severely limited, in part due to a lack of inexpensive, accessible, sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. As a point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) diagnostic test is now in widespread use to assess intestinal schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni in humans, we hypothesised that the same test could be used to detect livestock intestinal schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma bovis and Schistosoma curassoni. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the POC-CCA for the detection of intestinal livestock schistosomiasis in Senegal. POC-CCA sensitivity varied by ruminant group and by location/parasite species, while POC-CCA specificity in small ruminants, at least, did not vary across sites. We conclude that the currently-available POC-CCA does represent a potential diagnostic tool for animal schistosomiasis, but that the factors determining test performance warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "In non-clinical animal studies for drug discovery, histopathological evaluation is the most powerful tool to assess testicular toxicity. However, histological analysis is extremely invasive; many experimental animals are needed to evaluate changes in the pathology and anatomy of the testes over time. As an alternative, small animal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive methodology to examine testicular toxicity without radiation. The present study demonstrated the suitability of a new, ready-to-use compact MRI platform using a high-field permanent magnet to assist with the evaluation of testicular toxicity. To validate the utility of the MRI platform, male mice were treated with busulfan (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection). Tenty-eight days after treatment, both testes in busulfan-treated and control mice (n = 3/group) were non-invasively scanned in situ by MRI at 1 tesla. On a T1-weighted, 3D gradient-echo MRI sequences (voxel size: 0.23 x 0.23 x 0.50 mm), the total testicular volume in busulfan-treated mice was significantly smaller than in controls. On T1-weighted images, the signal intensity of the testes was significantly higher in busulfan-treated mice than in controls. The mice were sacrificed, and the testes were isolated for histopathological analysis. The weight of the testes in busulfan-treated mice significantly decreased, similar to the results of the non-invasive analysis. Additionally, periodic acid-Schiff stain-positive effusions were observed in the interstitium of the busulfan-treated mouse testes, potentially explaining T1 shortening due to a high concentration of glycoproteinaceous content. The present data demonstrated a rapid evaluation of testicular toxicity in vivo by compact MRI.",

    "abstract": "SummaryO_LIThe IUCN Red List criteria are widely used to determine extinction risks of plant and animal life. Here, we use The Red Lists criterion B, Geographic Range Size, to provide preliminary conservation assessments of the members of a large tribe of grasses, the Andropogoneae, with [~]1100 species, including maize, sorghum, and sugarcane and their wild relatives.\nC_LIO_LIWe use georeferenced occurrence data from the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) and automated individual species assessments using ConR to demonstrate efficacy and accuracy in using time-saving tools for conservation research. We validate our results with those from the IUCN-authorized assessment tool, GeoCAT.\nC_LIO_LIWe discovered a remarkably large gap in digitized information, with slightly more than 50% of the Andropogoneae lacking sufficient information for assessment. ConR and GeoCAT largely agree on which taxa are of least concern (>90%) or possibly threatened (<10%), highlighting that automating assessments with ConR is a viable strategy for preliminary conservation assessments of large plant groups. Results for crop wild relatives are similar to those for the entire data set.\nC_LIO_LIIncreasing digitization and collection needs to be a high priority. Available rapid assessment tools can then be used to identify species that warrant more comprehensive investigation.\nC_LI\n\nSocietal Impact StatementThe current rate of global biodiversity loss creates a pressing need to increase efficiency and throughput of extinction risk assessments in plants. We must assess as many plant species as possible, working with imperfect knowledge, to address the habitat loss and seemingly countless extinction threats of the Anthropocene. Large-scale, preliminary conservation assessments can play a fundamental role in setting priorities for more in-depth investigation.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization between auditory stimuli and brain rhythms is beneficial for perception. In principle, auditory perception could be improved by facilitating neural entrainment to sounds via brain stimulation. However, high inter-individual variability of brain stimulation effects questions the usefulness of this approach. Here we aimed to modulate auditory perception by modulating neural entrainment to frequency modulated (FM) sounds using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In addition, we evaluated the advantage of using tACS montages spatially optimized for each individuals anatomy and functional data compared to a standard montage applied to all participants. Across two different sessions, 2-Hz tACS was applied targeting auditory brain regions. Concurrent with tACS, participants listened to FM stimuli with modulation rate matching the tACS frequency but with different phase lags relative to the tACS, and detected silent gaps embedded in the FM sound. We observed that tACS modulated the strength of behavioral entrainment to the FM sound in a phase-lag specific manner. Both the optimal tACS lag and the magnitude of the tACS effect were variable across participants and sessions. Inter-individual variability of tACS effects was best explained by the strength of the inward electric field, depending on the field focality and proximity to the target brain region. Although additional evidence is necessary, our results also provided suggestive insights that spatially optimizing the electrode montage could be a promising tool to reduce inter-individual variability of tACS effects. This work demonstrates that tACS effectively modulates entrainment to sounds depending on the optimality of the electric field. However, the lack of reliability on optimal tACS lags calls for caution when planning tACS experiments based on separate sessions.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing number of available microbial genomes and metagenomes provide new opportunities to investigate the links between niche partitioning and genome evolution in the ocean, notably for the abundant and ubiquitous marine picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Here, by combining metagenome analyses of the Tara Oceans dataset with comparative genomics, including phyletic patterns and genomic context of individual genes from 256 reference genomes, we first showed that picocyanobacterial communities thriving in different niches possess distinct gene repertoires. We then managed to identify clusters of adjacent genes that display specific distribution patterns in the field (CAGs) and are thus potentially involved in the adaptation to particular environmental niches. Several CAGs are likely involved in the uptake or incorporation of complex organic forms of nutrients, such as guanidine, cyanate, cyanide, pyrimidine or phosphonates, which might be either directly used by cells, for e.g. the biosynthesis of proteins or DNA, or degraded into inorganic nitrogen and/or phosphorus forms. We also highlight the frequent presence of CAGs involved in polysaccharide capsule biosynthesis in Synechococcus populations thriving in both nitrogen- and phosphorus-depleted areas, which are absent in low-iron regions, suggesting that the complexes they encode may be too energy-consuming for picocyanobacteria thriving in these areas. In contrast, Prochlorococcus populations thriving in iron-depleted areas specifically possess an alternative respiratory terminal oxidase, potentially involved in the reduction of Fe(III) into Fe(II). Together, this study provides insights into how these key members of the phytoplankton community might behave in response to ongoing global change.\n\nSignificance StatementPicocyanobacteria face various environmental conditions in the ocean and numerous studies have shown that genetically distinct ecotypes colonize different niches. Yet the functional basis of their adaptation remains poorly known, essentially due to the large number of genes of yet unknown function, many of which have little or no beneficial effect on fitness. Here, by combining comparative genomics and metagenomics approaches, we have identified not only single genes but also entire gene clusters, potentially involved in niche adaptation. Although being sometimes present in only one or a few sequenced strains, they occur in a large part of the population in specific ecological niches and thus constitute precious targets for elucidating the biochemical function of yet unknown niche-related genes.",

    "abstract": "Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). PEL cell lines require expression of the cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (cFLIP) for survival, although KSHV encodes a viral homolog of this protein (vFLIP). Cellular and viral FLIP proteins have several functions, including, most importantly, the inhibition of pro-apoptotic caspase 8 and modulation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. To investigate the essential role of cFLIP and its potential redundancy with vFLIP in PEL cells, we first performed rescue experiments with human or viral FLIP proteins known to affect FLIP target pathways differently. The long and short isoforms of cFLIP and molluscum contagiosum virus MC159L, which are all strong caspase 8 inhibitors, efficiently rescued the loss of endogenous cFLIP activity in PEL cells. KSHV vFLIP was unable to fully rescue the loss of endogenous cFLIP and is therefore functionally distinct. Next, we employed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic rescue screens to identify loss of function perturbations that can compensate for cFLIP knockout. Results from these screens and our validation experiments implicate the canonical cFLIP target caspase 8 and TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1 or TNFRSF10A) in promoting constitutive death signaling in PEL cells. However, this process was independent of TRAIL receptor 2 or TRAIL, the latter of which is not detectable in PEL cell cultures. The requirement for cFLIP is also overcome by inactivation of the ER/Golgi resident chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesis and UFMylation pathways, Jagunal homolog 1 (JAGN1) or CXCR4. UFMylation and JAGN1, but not chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesis or CXCR4, contribute to TRAIL-R1 expression. In sum, our work shows that cFLIP is required in PEL cells to inhibit ligand-independent TRAIL-R1 cell death signaling downstream of a complex set of ER/Golgi-associated processes that have not previously been implicated in cFLIP or TRAIL-R1 function.",

The infection was difficult to diagnose, since the isolate and the feces sample tested negative for toxin-encoding genes using a routine commercial test. This prompted us to sequence n = 11 RT151s from various geographical regions to study their genomic characteristics and relatedness. By including whole genome sequence data from other sources, we could further place these isolates into the phylogenetic tree of C. difficile and assign them to their respective clades. These analyses revealed that 1) RT151s are polyphyletic with isolates falling into clades 1, and cryptic clades C-I and C-II 2) RT151 contains both non-toxigenic and toxigenic isolates and 3) RT151 C-II isolates contained mono-toxin pathogenicity loci (PaLoc). Additional analysis with PacBio circular consensus sequencing revealed that the isolate from our patient case report contains a novel PaLoc insertion site, lacked tcdA and a had significantly divergent tcdB sequence that might explain the failure of the diagnostic test. The study is noteworthy as 1) RT151 encompasses both typical and cryptic clades and 2) conclusive evidence for CDI due to clade C-II isolates was hitherto lacking.",

Here we use ultrasensitive mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), anti-PAR antibodies, and anti-PAR reagents to show that mammalian DNA is physiologically PARylated and to different levels in primary tissues. Inhibition of PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) increases DNA PARylation, supporting that the modification is reversible. DNA PARylation requires PARP1 and in vitro PARP1 PARylates single-stranded DNA, while PARG reverts the modification. DNA PARylation occurs at the N1-position of adenosine residues to form N1-Poly(ADP-ribosyl)-deoxyadenosine. Through partial hydrolysis of mammalian gDNA we identify PAR-DNA via the diagnostic deamination product N1-ribosyl-deoxyinosine to occur in vivo. We conclude that N1-adenosine PARylation is a novel, reversible DNA modification.",

    "abstract": "Employing the flatworm parasite Schistosoma mansoni as a model, we report the first application of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in parasitic helminths for loss-of-function targeting the SmfgfrA gene which encodes the stem cell marker, fibroblast growth factor receptor A. SmFGFRA is essential for maintaining schistosome stem cells and critical in the schistosome-host interplay. The SmfgfrA gene was targeted in S. mansoni adult worms, eggs and schistosomula using a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a transcriptional repressor KRAB. We showed that SmfgfrA repression resulted in considerable phenotypic differences in the modulated parasites compared with controls, including reduced levels of SmfgfrA transcription and decreased protein expression of SmFGFRA, a decline in EdU (thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine, which specifically stains schistosome stem cells) signal, and an increase in cell apoptosis. Notably, reduced SmfgfrA transcription was evident in miracidia hatched from SmfgfrA-repressed eggs, and resulted in a significant change in miracidial behavior, indicative of a durable repression effect caused by CRISPRi. Intravenous injection of mice with SmfgfrA-repressed eggs resulted in granulomas that were markedly reduced in size and a decline in the level of serum IgE, emphasizing the importance of SmFGFRA in regulating the host immune response induced during schistosome infection. Our findings show the feasibility of applying CRISPRi for effective, targeted transcriptional repression in schistosomes, and provide the basis for employing CRISPRi to selectively perturb gene expression in parasitic helminths on a genome-wide scale.",

We have examined its dynamics and impact during mitosis. GFP-USP31 associates with the mitotic and central spindles, its levels are increased 2-3-fold in prometaphase compared to asynchronous cells and it is dynamically phosphorylated in a CDK1 dependent manner. We find that USP31 depleted cells display altered spindle morphology and chromosomal segregation errors, whilst stable expression of a catalytically inactive form of USP31 leads to polyploidy. At prometaphase, levels of multiple CPC components are destabilised, most prominently INCENP. Under anaphase conditions, depletion of USP31 impairs the translocation of both endogenous and ectopically expressed INCENP to the spindle mid-zone, whilst expression of catalytically inactive USP31 results in multiple ectopic cleavage furrows. In summary, our data indicate a multifaceted regulatory role for USP31 during mitosis, with a profound impact on chromosomal passenger complex abundance, dynamics and function.",

    "abstract": "The p63 transcription factor is critical for epidermis formation in embryonic development, but its role in the adult epidermis is poorly understood. Here we show that acute genetic ablation of {Delta}Np63, the main p63 isoform, in adult epidermis disrupts keratinocyte proliferation and self-maintenance and, unexpectedly, triggers an inflammatory psoriasis-like condition. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed down-regulation of the cell cycle genes, up-regulation of differentiation markers, and induction of several pro-inflammatory pathways in {Delta}Np63-ablated keratinocytes. Intriguingly, {Delta}Np63-ablated cells disappear three weeks post-ablation, at the expense of the remaining non-ablated cells. This is not associated with active cell death mechanisms, but rather with reduced self-maintenance capacity. Indeed, in vivo wound healing assay, a physiological readout of the epidermal stem cell function, is severely impaired in {Delta}Np63-ablated mice. We found that the Wnt signaling pathway (Wnt10a, Fzd6, Fzd10) and the AP1 factors (JunB, Fos, FosB) are the likely {Delta}Np63 effectors responsible for keratinocyte proliferation/stemness and suppression of differentiation, respectively, while interleukins IL-1a, IL-18, IL-24, and IL-36{gamma} are the likely negative effectors responsible for the suppression of inflammation. These data establish {Delta}Np63 as a critical node that coordinates epidermal homeostasis, stemness, and suppression of inflammation in the adult epidermis, upstream of known regulatory pathways.",

While PTH can stimulate osteo-progenitor expansion and bone synthesis, how PTH-signaling intensity in progenitors is controlled is unclear. Endochondral bone osteoblasts arise from perichondrium-derived osteoprogenitors and hypertrophic chondrocytes (HC). We found, via single-cell transcriptomics, HC descendent cells activate membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) and the PTH pathway as they transition to osteoblasts in neonatal and adult mice. Unlike Mmp14 global knockouts, HC lineage-specific Mmp14 null mutants (Mmp14{Delta}HC) produce more bone. Mechanistically, MMP14 cleaves the extracellular domain of PTH1R, dampening PTH signaling and PTH signaling is enhanced in Mmp14{Delta}HC mutants. We found HC-derived osteoblasts contribute [~]50% of osteogenesis promoted by treatment with PTH 1-34 and this response was amplified in Mmp14{Delta}HC. MMP14 control of PTH signaling likely applies also to both HC- and non- HC-derived osteoblasts because their transcriptomes are highly similar. Our study identifies a novel paradigm of MMP14 activity-mediated titration of PTH signaling in the osteoblast lineage, contributing new insights into bone metabolism with therapeutic significance for bone-wasting diseases.",

We show that two pG4s on the same DNA strand (dimeric pG4s) are sufficient to induce assembly of an efficient minimal replication origin without inducing transcription. Dimeric pG4s in replication origins trigger formation of an NFR next to precisely-positioned nucleosomes enriched in H2A.Z on this minimal origin and genome-wide. Thus, our data suggest a crucial role for dimeric pG4s in the organization and duplication of vertebrate genomes. It supports the hypothesis that a nucleosome close to an NFR is a shared signal for the formation of replication origins in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent that can cause serious cardiotoxic side effects, leading to functional cardiac decline and ultimately, congestive heart failure (HF). Impaired mitochondrial function and energetics are thought to be key factors driving progression into HF. We have previously shown in a rat model of chronic intravenous DOX-administration that heart failure with reduced ejection fraction correlates with mitochondrial loss and dysfunction. Adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor, regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, including fatty acid oxidation. We hypothesized that AMPK activation could restore mitochondrial number and function and therefore be a novel cardioprotective strategy for the prevention of DOX-HF. We therefore set out to assess whether 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-{beta}-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an activator of AMPK, could prevent cardiac functional decline in this clinically relevant rat model of DOX-HF. In line with our hypothesis, AICAR improved cardiac systolic function. We show that this could be due to normalisation of substrate supply to the heart, as AICAR prevented DOX-induced dyslipidaemia. AICAR furthermore improved cardiac mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, despite no increase in mitochondrial number. In addition, we found that AICAR prevented excessive myocardial atrophy, and RNAseq analysis showed that this may be due to normalisation of protein synthesis pathways, which are impaired in DOX-treated rat hearts. Taken together, these results show promise for use of AICAR as a cardioprotective agent in DOX-HF to both preserve cardiac mass and improve cardiac function.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication, characterization, and application of a microchip-based electrokinetic biosensor which exploits streaming current for signal transduction. The sensor chips, fabricated using standard silicon fabrication techniques, are based on Si-glass microfluidics offering precision, robustness, and transparency. A custom-built chip-manifold allowing easy interfacing with standard microfluidic connections is also developed which shows leak-free integration of the microchips up to 6 bar of applied pressure. Within this range of pressure, the devices show linear and highly reproducible values for flow rates and streaming current with RMS noise below 20 pA. The microchips designed for multiplexed measurements were tested with the detection of free proteins (streptavidin) and also transmembrane proteins of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) to demonstrate the capacity of the microchips to detect various types of bio-analytes. The limit of detection (LOD) for streptavidin was estimated to be 0.5 nM while for the transmembrane protein (CD9), the LOD was found to be 1.2x106 sEVs/mL. The sensitivity (LOD) of the devices was found to be about 4 times better in targeting CD9 transmembrane protein of H1975 extracellular vesicles when compared to commercial silica capillary which was used previously. The improvement in LOD is attributed to the higher surface quality of the sensor in terms of the density of surface charges which may be further exploited for even lower LOD. In addition, optical detection of fluorophore-tagged standard proteins was done through the optical window of the chip manifold and the transparent glass cap of the microchip.",

    "abstract": "Bioemulsions are attractive platforms for the expansion of adherent cells in bioreactors. Their design relies on the self-assembly of protein nanosheets at liquid-liquid interfaces, displaying strong interfacial mechanical properties and promoting integrin-mediated cell adhesion. However, most systems developed to date have focused on fluorinated oils, which are unlikely to be accepted for direct implantation of resulting cell products for regenerative medicine, and protein nanosheets self-assembly at other interfaces has not been investigated. In this report, the composition of aliphatic pro-surfactants palmitoyl chloride and sebacoyl chloride, on the assembly kinetics of poly(L-lysine) at silicone oil interfaces and characterisation of ultimate interfacial shear mechanics and viscoelasticity is presented. The impact of the resulting nanosheets on the adhesion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is investigated via immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating the engagement of the classic focal adhesion-actin cytoskeleton machinery. The ability of MSCs to proliferate at the corresponding interfaces is quantified. In addition, expansion of MSCs at other non-fluorinated oil interfaces, based on mineral and plant-based oils is investigated. Finally, the proof-of-concept of such non-fluorinated oil systems for the formulation of bioemulsions supporting stem cell adhesion and expansion is demonstrated.",

Heteroplasmy can be detected by visual inspection of Sanger sequencing chromatograms, where it appears as multiple peaks of fluorescence at a single nucleotide position. Visual inspection of chromatograms is both consuming and highly subjective, as heteroplasmy is difficult to differentiate from background noise. Few software solutions are available to automate the detection of point heteroplasmies, and those that are available are typically proprietary, lack customization or are unsuitable for automated heteroplasmy assessment in large datasets.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we present PHFinder, a Python-based, open source tool to assist in the detection of point heteroplasmies in large numbers of Sanger chromatograms.

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in rapid muscle loss. The mechanisms of muscle atrophy have been well-described but there is limited information specific to SCI. Exogenous molecular interventions to slow muscle atrophy in severe-to-complete SCI have been relatively ineffective and the wide-ranging physiologic response to SCI requires the search for novel therapeutic targets. Connexin hemichannels (CxHC) allow non-selective passage of small molecules into and out of the cell. Boldine, a CxHC-inhibiting aporphine found in the boldo tree (Peumus boldus), has shown promising pre-clinical results in slowing atrophy during sepsis and dysferlinopathy. We administered 50 mg/kg/d of boldine to spinal cord transected mice beginning 3 d post-injury. Tissue was collected 7 and 28 d post-SCI and the gastrocnemius was used for multiomic profiling. Boldine did not prevent body or muscle mass loss but attenuated SCI-induced changes in the abundance of proline, phenylalanine, leucine and isoleucine, as well as glucose, 7 d post-SCI. SCI resulted in the differential expression of ~7,700 and ~2,000 genes at 7 and 28 d, respectively, compared to sham animals, with enrichment for pathways associated with ribosome biogenesis, translation and oxidative phosphorylation. Boldine altered the expression of ~150 genes at 7 d and ~110 genes at 28 d post-SCI. Methylation analyses highlighted distinct patterns at both 7 and 28 d following SCI both with and without boldine. Taken together, boldine is not an efficacious therapy to preserve body and muscle mass after complete SCI, though it preserved or attenuated SCI-induced changes across the metabolome, transcriptome and methylome.",

    "abstract": "Telomere attrition is considered a hallmark of ageing. Untangling the proximate causes of telomere attrition may therefore reveal important aspects about the ageing process. In a landmark paper in 2002 Thomas von Zglinicki demonstrated that oxidative stress causes telomere attrition in cell culture. In the next 20 years, oxidative stress became firmly embedded into modern theories of ageing and telomere attrition. However, a recent surge of in vivo studies reveals an inconsistent pattern questioning the unequivocal role of oxidative stress in telomere dynamics, in living organisms. Here we report the results of the first formal meta-analysis on the association between oxidative stress and telomere dynamics in vivo, representing 37 studies, 4,834 individuals, and 18,590 correlational measurements. The overall correlation between oxidative stress markers and telomere dynamics was indistinguishable from zero. This result was independent of the type of oxidative stress marker, telomere dynamic, or taxonomic group. However, telomere measurement method affected the analysis with TRF but not qPCR-based studies showing a significant overall correlation. The correlation was more pronounced in short-lived species and during the adult life phase, when ageing becomes apparent. We then performed an additional meta-analysis of interventional studies (n=7) manipulating oxidative stress. This revealed a significant effect of treatment on telomere dynamics. Our findings indicate that oxidative stress may have a profound effect on telomere dynamics in living organisms fundamentally underpinning the process of ageing.",

It is a common cause of nosocomial infections, and is particularly troublesome due to extensive intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance. Using experimental evolution, we generated Drosophila-adapted E. faecalis strains, which exhibited immune resistance, resulting in increased in vivo growth and virulence. Resistance was characterised by mutations in bacterial pathways responsive to cell envelope stress. Drosophila-adapted strains exhibited changes in sensitivity to relevant antimicrobials, including daptomycin and vancomycin. Evolved daptomycin-resistant strains harboured mutations in the same signalling systems, with some strains showing increased virulence similar to Drosophila-adapted strains. Our results show that common mechanisms provide a route to resistance to both antimicrobials and host immunity in E. faecalis and demonstrate that the selection and emergence of antibiotic resistance in vivo does not require antibiotic exposure.\n\nOne sentence summaryHost interaction can promote antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial treatment can promote virulence in E. faecalis.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor with poor prognosis, highlighting an urgent need for novel treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated epigenetic regulators of glioblastoma cell survival through CRISPR/Cas9 based genetic ablation screens using a customized sgRNA library EpiDoKOL, which targets critical functional domains of chromatin modifiers. Screens conducted in multiple cell lines revealed ASH2L, a histone lysine methyltransferase complex subunit, as a major regulator of glioblastoma cell viability. ASH2L depletion led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RNA sequencing and greenCUT&RUN together identified a set of cell cycle regulatory genes, such as TRA2B, BARD1, KIF20B, ARID4A and SMARCC1 that were downregulated upon ASH2L depletion. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the interaction partners of ASH2L in glioblastoma cell lines as SET1/MLL family members including SETD1A, SETD1B, MLL1 and MLL2. We further showed that glioblastoma cells had a differential dependency on expression of SET1/MLL family members for survival. The growth of ASH2L-depleted glioblastoma cells was markedly slower than controls in orthotopic in vivo models. TCGA analysis showed high ASH2L expression in glioblastoma compared to low grade gliomas and immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant ASH2L expression in glioblastoma tissues, attesting to its clinical relevance. Therefore, high throughput, robust and affordable screens with focused libraries, such as EpiDoKOL, holds great promise to enable rapid discovery of novel epigenetic regulators of cancer cell survival, such as ASH2L. Together, we suggest that targeting ASH2L could serve as a new therapeutic opportunity for glioblastoma.",
