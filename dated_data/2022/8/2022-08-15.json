    "abstract": "How can we best vary the application of pesticides and antibiotics to delay resistance evolution? Previous theoretical studies have focused on qualitative resistance traits, and have mostly assumed that resistance alleles are already present in a population. But many real resistance traits are quantitative, and the evolution of resistant genotypes in the field may depend on de novo mutation and recombination. Here, I use an individual-based, forward-time, quantitative-genetic simulation model to investigate the evolution of quantitative resistance. I evaluate the performance of four application strategies for delaying resistance evolution, to wit, the (1) sequential, (2) mosaic, (3) periodic, and (4) combined strategies. I find that which strategy is best depends on initial efficacy. When at the onset, xenobiotics completely prevent reproduction in treated demes, a combined strategy is best. On the other hand, when populations are partially resistant, the combined strategy is inferior to mosaic and periodic strategies, especially when resistance alleles are antagonistically pleiotropic. Thus, the optimal application strategy for managing against the rise of quantitative resistance depends on pleiotropy and whether or not partial resistance is already present in a population. This result appears robust to variation in pest reproductive mode and migration rate, direct fitness costs for resistant phenotypes, and the extend of refugial habitats.",

    "abstract": "Linking high-throughput environmental data (enviromics) into genomic prediction (GP) is a cost-effective strategy for increasing selection intensity under genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE). This study developed a data-driven approach based on Environment-Phenotype Associations (EPA) aimed at recycling important GxE information from historical breeding data. EPA was developed in two applications: (1) scanning a secondary source of genetic variation, weighted from the shared reaction-norms of past-evaluated genotypes; (2) pinpointing weights of the similarity among trial-sites (locations), given the historical impact of each envirotyping data variable for a given site. Then, the EPA outcomes were integrated into multi-environment GP models through a new single-step GBLUP. The wheat trial data used included 36 locations, 8 years and 3 target populations of environments (TPE) in India. Four prediction scenarios and 6 kernel-models within/across TPEs were tested. Our results suggest that the conventional GBLUP, without enviromic data or when omitting EPA, is inefficient in predicting the performance of wheat lines in future years. However, when EPA was introduced as an intermediary learning step to reduce the dimensionality of the GxE kernels while connecting phenotypic and environmental-wide variation, a significant enhancement of GxE prediction accuracy was evident. EPA revealed that the effect of seasonality makes strategies such as \"covariable selection\" unfeasible because GxE is year-germplasm specific. We propose that the EPA effectively serves as a \"reinforcement learner\" algorithm capable of uncovering the effect of seasonality over the reaction-norms, with the benefits of better forecasting the similarities between past and future trialing sites. EPA combines the benefits of dimensionality reduction while reducing the uncertainty of genotype-by-year predictions and increasing the resolution of GP for the genotype-specific level.",

We defined histopathological patterns in over 400 clear-cell renal cell carcinoma H&E-stained slides of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and resolved sampling and staining differences by harmonizing textural composition. By integrating multi-omic and imaging data, we profiled their clinical, immunological, genomic, and transcriptomic phenotypes. Histological grade, stage, adaptive immunity, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition signature and lower mutation burden were more common in stroma-rich samples. Histological proximity between the malignant and normal renal tissues was associated with poor survival, cellular proliferation, tumor heterogeneity, and wild-type PBRM1.

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) are enigmatic mechano- or chemosensory cells lying along the central canal of the spinal cord. Recent studies in zebrafish larvae and lampreys have shown that CSF-cNs control postures and movements via spinal connections. However, the structures, connectivity, and functions in mammals remain largely unknown. Here we developed a method to genetically target mouse CSF-cNs that highlighted structural connections and functions. We first found that intracerebroventricular injection of adeno-associated virus with a neuron-specific promoter and Pkd2l1-Cre mice specifically labeled CSF-cNs. Single-cell labeling of 71 CSF-cNs revealed rostral axon extensions of over 1800 m in unmyelinated bundles in the ventral funiculus and terminated on CSF-cNs to form a recurrent circuitry, which was further determined by serial electron microscopy and electrophysiology. CSF-cNs were also found to connect with axial motor neurons and premotor interneurons around the central canal and within the axon bundles. Chemogenetic CSF-cNs inactivation reduced speed and step frequency during treadmill locomotion. Our data revealed the basic structures and connections of mouse CSF-cNs to control spinal motor circuits for proper locomotion. The versatile methods developed in this study will contribute to further understanding of CSF-cNs functions in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens including viruses evolve in tandem with diversity in their animal and human hosts. For SARS-coV2, the focus is generally for understanding such coevolution on the virus spike protein since it demonstrates high mutation rates compared to other genome regions, particularly in the receptor-binding domain (RBD).\n\nViral sequences of the SARS-coV2 19B (S) clade and variants of concern from different continents, were investigated, with a focus on the A.29 lineage which presented with different mutational patterns within the 19B (S) lineages in order to learn more about how SARS-coV2 may have evolved and adapted to widely diverse populations globally.\n\nResults indicated that SARS-coV2 went through evolutionary constrains and intense selective pressure, particularly in Africa. This was manifested in a departure from neutrality with excess nonsynonymous mutations and a negative Tajima D consistent with rapid expansion and directional selection as well as deletion and deletion-frameshifts in the N-terminal domain (NTD region) of the spike protein.\n\nIn conclusion, viral transmission during epidemics through population of diverse genomic structure and marked complexity may be a significant factor for the virus to acquire distinct patterns of mutations within these populations in order to ensure its survival and fitness, hence in the emergence of novel variants and strains.\n\nImportanceIn this study, we justify the fact that the viruss evolution varies across continents, with each continent showing different amounts and patterns of mutations and deletions, which was manifested in the 19B (S) clade of SARS-coV2, particularly in areas with high population complexity, such as Africa, despite the low rate of sampling and data sharing. The findings show that SARS-coV2 was subject to evolutionary constraints and intense selective pressure. This study will contribute to the scanty amount of research on the SARS-coV2 coevolution and adaptation, in which the host variation is of great significance in understanding the intricacies of viral host coevolution.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized into membrane-bound organelles, allowing each organelle to maintain the specialized conditions needed for their specific functions. One of the features that change between organelles is luminal pH. In the endocytic and secretory pathways, luminal pH is controlled by isoforms and concentration of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). In the endolysosomal pathway, copies of complete V-ATPase complexes accumulate as membranes mature from early endosomes to late endosomes and lysosomes. Thus, each compartment becomes more acidic as maturation proceeds. Lysosome acidification is essential for the breakdown of macromolecules delivered from endosomes as well as cargo from different autophagic pathways, and dysregulation of this process is linked to various diseases. Thus, it is important to understand the regulation of the V-ATPase. Here we describe a high-throughput method for screening inhibitors/activators of V-ATPase activity using Acridine Orange (AO) as a fluorescent reporter for acidified yeast vacuolar lysosomes. Through this method, the acidification of purified vacuoles can be measured in real-time in half-volume 96-well plates or a larger 384-well format. This not only reduces the cost of expensive low abundance reagents, but it drastically reduces the time needed to measure individual conditions in large volume cuvettes.",

Even subtle loss of directional growth orchestration can result in a huge impact when the plant is impaired to adapt to an ever-changing environment, where it is exposed to manifold exogenous stimuli simultaneously. We present a newly designed chamber to obtain live images to track organ growth and movement differences, called RaspberyPi Dark Chambers (RaPiD-chamber). The RaPiD-chamber is easy to self-assemble and cost-efficient and allows to monitor the continuous growth of etiolated seedlings, as well as their response to light of different wavelengths and from chosen positions. We tested the advice by comparing hypocotyl elongation rate and response to unilateral white and blue light exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana Col0. Additionally, we compared the elongation rate of etiolated hypocotyls between Col0 and kin10, a mutant lacking the catalytic subunit of the cellular signaling hub SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1). kin10 is known for its diminished ability to control hypocotyl elongation. As a case study, we compared the growth dynamics of etiolated Col0 versus kin10. Without further energy source supplementation to the growth medium, the mutant cannot keep up with hypocotyl elongation. Additionally, continuous observation of the dark-grown seedlings allowed us to determine a shift in the dynamics of apical hook angle formation for the mutant.",

Yet, we are still missing a mechanistic explanation of the whole brain dynamics underlying these plasticity defining changes.\n\nMethodIn this study, we explored the effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over left primary motor cortex (L-M1) on functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) in patients with ET. Resting-state fMRI (RsfMRI) was acquired before and after a single session of rTMS in 30 patients with ET and compared with RsfMRI of 20 age and gender matched healthy controls (HCs). We have measured the effect of brain stimulation using network topological re-organization through whole brain integration and segregation, brain stability and capacity of neural propagation through metastability and intrinsic ignition.\n\nResultsPatients with ET had altered FCD measures compared to controls. After a single session rTMS, the brain connectivity measures approached normality and patients with ET revealed significantly higher integration, lower segregation with higher metastability and increased intrinsic ignition.\n\nConclusionBrain metastability and intrinsic ignition measures could be valuable tools in appreciating mechanisms of brain stimulation in ET and other neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Animal studies of neurodevelopmental plasticity have shown that intrinsic brain activity evolves from high amplitude and globally synchronized to suppressed and sparse as plasticity declines and the cortex matures. Leveraging resting-state functional MRI data from 1033 individuals (8-23 years), we reveal that this stereotyped refinement of intrinsic activity occurs during human development and provides evidence for a cortical gradient of neurodevelopmental plasticity during childhood and adolescence. Specifically, we demonstrate that declines in the amplitude of intrinsic activity are initiated heterochronously across regions, coupled to the maturation of a plasticity-restricting structural feature, and temporally staggered along a hierarchical sensorimotor-association axis from ages 8 to 18. Youth from disadvantaged environments exhibit reduced intrinsic activity in regions further up the sensorimotor-association axis, suggestive of a reduced level of plasticity in late-maturing cortices. Our results uncover a hierarchical axis of neurodevelopment and offer insight into the temporal sequence of protracted neurodevelopmental plasticity in humans.",

Here, we describe the development, optimization, and application of a novel, single-plasmid-based CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) platform for targeted genetic overexpression in C. albicans, which employs a guide RNA to target an activator complex to the promoter region of a gene of interest, thus driving transcriptional expression of that gene. Using this system, we demonstrate the ability of CRISPRa to drive high levels of gene expression in C. albicans, and we assess optimal guide RNA targeting for robust and constitutive overexpression. We further demonstrate the specificity of the system via RNA sequencing. We highlight the application of CRISPRa to overexpress genes involved in pathogenesis and drug resistance and contribute towards the identification of novel phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Many Archaea produce membrane-spanning glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGTs) lipids that serve as unique biomarkers of past environments. These lipids can contain up to eight cyclopentane rings, where an increase in ring cyclization is generally associated with growth in more acidic, higher temperature, or more energy limited conditions. Recently the genes that encode GDGT ring synthases, grsAB, were identified and characterized in model thermoacidophiles Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Saccharolobus solfataricus. However, the distribution and abundance of grs homologs across environments inhabited by these and related Archaea remains unknown. To address this, we examined the distribution of grs homologs in archaeal and bacterial cultivar genomes, single cell genomes, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes from thermal springs across the planet, where temperature, pH, and geochemical data take at time of sampling. The relative abundance of grs in these microbial communities exhibits a strong negative correlation with pH, and weak positive correlation with temperature. Genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from Archaea that encode two or more copies of grs are significantly more widespread in low pH springs. Homologs of grs were detected in MAGs from 12 archaeal classes, with the most well-represented being the Thermoproteia. Homologs of grs were also detected among several classes of uncultured Archaea, including the Korarchaeia, Bathyarchaeia, and Hadarchaeia. Several Nitrososphaeria MAGs had high copy numbers of grs (> 3), and the functional role of these copies cannot yet be explained. Notably, grs genes were also found in MAGs from the bacterial class Acidobacteria. Based on phylogenetic analyses, it is likely that Acidobacteria acquired these genes horizontally from Archaea. Broadly, our results highlight the key role of grs-catalyzed lipid cyclization in the diversification of Archaea in hot and acidic environments.",

The G446S and N460K mutations of BA.2.75 are primarily responsible for its enhanced resistance to neutralizing antibodies. The R493Q mutation, a reversion to the prototype sequence, reduces BA.2.75 neutralization resistance. The mutational impact is consistent with their locations in common neutralizing antibody epitopes. Further, the BA.2.75 variant shows enhanced cell-cell fusion over BA.2, driven largely by the N460K mutation, which enhances S processing. Structural modeling revealed a new receptor contact introduced by N460K, supporting a mechanism of potentiated receptor utilization and syncytia formation.",

    "abstract": "The link between the gut microbiome and the brain has gained increasing scientific and public interest for its potential to explain psychiatric risk. While differences in gut microbiome composition have been associated with several mental health problems, evidence to date has been largely based on animal models and human studies in small sample sizes. Here, we aimed to systematically characterize associations of the gut microbiome with overall psychiatric symptoms as well as with specific domains of emotional and behavioral problems, assessed via the maternally rated Child Behavior Checklist in 1,784 ten-year-old children from the multi-ethnic, population-based Generation R Study. While we observe lower gut microbiome diversity in case of more overall and specific mental health problems, associations were not significant. Likewise, we did not identify any taxonomic feature associated with mental health problems after multiple testing correction, although nominally significant findings indicated depletion of genera previously associated with psychiatric disorders, including Anaerotruncus, Anaeroplasma, and Hungatella. The identified compositional abundance differences were found to be similar across all mental health problems. Finally, we did not find any specific microbial functions that were enriched in relation to children with mental health problems. In conclusion, based on the largest sample examined to date, we found no clear evidence of associations between gut microbiome diversity, taxonomies or functions and mental health problems in the general pediatric population. In future, the use of longitudinal designs with repeated measurements microbiome and psychiatric outcomes will be critical to clarify any emerging associations between the gut microbiome and mental health from early life to adulthood.",

    "abstract": "The microorganisms that inhabit human skin, collectively termed the skin microbiome, must overcome numerous challenges that typically impede microbial growth, including low pH, osmotic pressure, and low nutrient availability. Yet, the skin microbiota thrive on the skin and have adapted to these stressful conditions. Limited skin nutrients are available for microbial use in this unique niche, including those from host-derived sweat, sebum, and corneocytes. Here, we have developed physiologically-relevant, skin-like growth media that is composed of compounds present in human sweat and sebum. We find that skin-associated bacterial species exhibit unique growth profiles in different concentrations of sweat and sebum. The majority of strains evaluated demonstrate a preference for high sweat concentrations, while sebum preference is highly variable, suggesting that the capacity for sebum utilization may be an important driver of skin microbial community structure. Furthermore, these findings provide experimental rationale for why different skin microenvironments harbor distinct microbiome communities. In all, our study further emphasizes the importance of studying microorganisms in an ecologically-relevant context, which is critical for our understanding of their physiology, ecology, and function on the skin.",

    "abstract": "Termites represent one of the most important insect groups worldwide due to their key role as plant decomposers and proxy of carbon recycling in the tropical rainforest ecosystems. Besides, high relevance in research has been given to these social insects due to a prominent role as urban pests. However, one of the most fascinating aspects of termites are their defence strategies that prevent the growth of detrimental microbiological strains on their nests. One success factor is the key role of the nest allied microbiome. Understanding how beneficial microbial strains aid termites in pathogen biocontrol strategies could provide us with an enhanced repertoire for fighting antimicrobial resistant strains or mine for genes for bioremediation purposes.\n\nWe carried out a multiomics approach for dissecting the nest microbiome in a wide range of termite species, covering several feeding habits and three geographical locations at two tropical sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and an African savanna. Our experimental approach included untargeted volatile metabolomics, targeted evaluation of volatile naphthalene, taxonomical profile for bacteria and fungi through amplicon sequencing, and further dive into the genetic repertoire through a metagenomic sequencing approach.\n\nVolatile naphthalene was present in species belonging to the genera Nasutitermes and Cubitermes. We further assessed the apparent differences in terms of bacterial community structure, having found a stronger influence from feeding habits and genera, rather than the geographical location. Lastly, our metagenomic analysis revealed that the gene content provides both soil feeding genera with similar functional profiles, while the wood feeding genus shows a different one. These results seem to be independent of the geographical location, indicating that the nest functional profile is heavily influenced by the diet of the termite inhabiting, building, and maintaining the nest.",

    "abstract": "Enterovirus D68 is a re-emerging enterovirus that causes acute respiratory illness in infants and has recently been linked to Acute Flaccid Myelitis. Here, we show that the histone deacetylase, SIRT-1, is essential for autophagy and EV-D68 infection. Knockdown of SIRT-1 inhibits autophagy and reduces EV-D68 extracellular titers. The proviral activity of SIRT-1 does not require its deacetylase activity or functional autophagy. SIRT-1s proviral activity is, we demonstrate, mediated through the repression of ER stress. Inducing ER stress through thapsigargin treatment or SERCA2A knockdown in SIRT-1 knockdown cells had no additional effect on EV-D68 extracellular titers. Knockdown of SIRT-1 also decreases poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 titers but not coxsackievirus B3. In non-lytic conditions, EV-D68 is primarily released in an enveloped form, and SIRT-1 is required for this process. Our data show that SIRT-1, through its translocation to the cytosol, is critical to promote the release of enveloped EV-D68 viral particles.",

    "abstract": "Genome regulation involves complex and highly regulated protein interactions that are often mediated through post-translational modifications (PTMs). SUMOylation - the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) - is a conserved PTM in eukaryotes that has been implicated in a number of essential processes such as nuclear import, DNA damage repair, transcriptional control, and chromatin organization. In Drosophila, SUMO is essential for viability and its depletion from the female germline causes infertility associated with global loss of heterochromatin, and illicit upregulation of transposons and lineage-inappropriate genes. However, the specific targets of SUMO and its mechanistic role in different cellular pathways are still poorly understood. Here, we developed a proteomics-based strategy to characterize the SUMOylated proteome in Drosophila that allowed us to identify ~1500 SUMO sites in 843 proteins in the fly ovary. A high-confidence set of SUMOylated proteins is highly enriched in factors involved in heterochromatin regulation and several different aspects of the piRNA pathway that represses transposons, including piRNA biogenesis and function. Furthermore, we show that SUMOylation of several piRNA pathway proteins occurs in a Piwi-dependent manner, indicating a functional implication of this modification in the cellular response to transposon activity. Together, these data highlight the impact of SUMOylation on epigenetic regulation and reveal an unexpectedly broad role of the SUMO pathway in the cellular defense against genomic parasites. Finally, this work provides a valuable resource and a system that can be adapted to the study of SUMOylation in other Drosophila tissues.",

We uncover previously unidentified clusters of hepatocytes characterized by either high or low srebp1 expression with unique molecular signatures of lipid synthesis. We find that NAFLD livers have elevated expression of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a gene previously associated with lipid synthesis. Furthermore, nuclear expression of CAR positively correlates with steatohepatitis in humans.

However, few tools are available to measure the activity of a specific RTK in individual living cells. Here, we present pYtags, a modular approach for monitoring the activity of a user-defined RTK by live-cell microscopy. pYtags consist of an RTK modified with a tyrosine activation motif that, when phosphorylated, recruits a fluorescently labeled tandem SH2 domain with high specificity. We show that pYtags enable the monitoring of a specific RTK on seconds-to-minutes time scales and across subcellular and multicellular length scales. Using a pYtag biosensor for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we quantitively characterize how signaling dynamics vary with the identity and dose of activating ligand. We show that orthogonal pYtags can be used to monitor the dynamics of EGFR and ErbB2 activity in the same cell, revealing distinct phases of activation for each RTK. The specificity and modularity of pYtags opens the door to robust biosensors of multiple tyrosine kinases and may enable engineering of synthetic receptors with orthogonal response programs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIpYtags report on signaling of user-defined RTKs in living cells\nC_LIO_LIEGFR signaling dynamics depend on ligand identity and dimer strength\nC_LIO_LIrthogonal pYtags enable reporter multiplexing\nC_LIO_LIpYtags can report on signaling of endogenously expressed RTKs\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (PFILDs) cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Antifibrotic agents slow progression, but most of the clinical need remains unmet. The archetypal PFILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Chronic progression is driven by transforming growth factor (TGF-){beta}1 signalling. It is punctuated by inflammatory flares known as acute exacerbations (AE-IPF), which are associated with accelerated decline and high mortality. We hypothesized that acute injury responses underlying exacerbations and the mechanisms of chronic fibrosis overlap at the molecular level, via a cell surface assembly nucleated by galectin-3 that we term the  gal-3-fibrosome. We focused upon a putative pro-inflammatory galectin-3 ligand, the CD98:integrin complex. Our data indicate CD98 and {beta}1-integrin co-localise with galectin-3 within epithelial cells in IPF lung tissue, and within 40 nm in human lung tissue treated with TGF-{beta}1 compared to controls. CD98 is required for interleukin (IL-)6 and IL-8 responses to biochemical and biophysical conditions mimicking stimuli of AE-IPF in vivo, ex vivo and in cells, and for an interstitial neutrophilic response in a mouse model. We demonstrate this pathway progresses via intracellular influx of Ca2+ mediated by TRPV4, and NF-{kappa}B activation, operating in positive feedback. Lastly we show the CD98- and galectin-3-dependence of IL-6 and IL-8 responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain and the conservation of this response pattern between lung epithelial cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. Taken together our findings identify CD98 as a key mediator of both pro-fibrotic and acute inflammatory responses in the lung with relevance to AE- and chronic progression of IPF, and the priming of fibrotic lungs for acute inflammatory responses. They similarly implicate CD98 and galectin-3 as mediators of COVID pneumonitis and worse outcomes in ILD patients with COVID.",

    "abstract": "The spine provides structure and support to the body, yet how it develops its characteristic morphology as the organism grows is little understood. This is underscored by the commonality of conditions in which the spine curves abnormally such as scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis. Understanding the origin of such spinal curves has been challenging in part due to the lack of appropriate animal models. Recently, zebrafish have emerged as promising tools with which to understand the origin of spinal curves. Using zebrafish, we demonstrate that the Urotensin II-related peptides (URPs), Urp1 and Urp2, are essential for maintaining spine morphology. Urp1 and Urp2 are 10-amino acid cyclic peptides expressed by neurons lining the central canal of the spinal cord. Upon combined genetic loss of Urp1 and Urp2, adolescent-onset planar curves manifested in the caudal region of the spine, akin to a lordosis-like condition. Highly similar curves were caused by mutation of Uts2r3, an URP receptor. Quantitative comparisons revealed that Urotensin-associated curves were distinct from other zebrafish spinal curve mutants that more closely reflected idiopathic scoliosis or kyphosis. Last, we found that the Reissner fiber, a proteinaceous thread that sits in the central canal and has been implicated in the control of spine morphology, breaks down prior to curve formation in an idiopathic scoliosis model but was unperturbed by loss of Uts2r3. This suggests a Reissner fiber-independent mechanism of curvature in Urotensin-deficient mutants. Overall, our results show that Urp1 and Urp2 control zebrafish spine morphology and establish new animal models of lordosis-like curves.",

Using fire perimeters (2000-2019), we investigated differences in fire occurrence (frequency, area burned, percent of area burned) among seed transfer zones within Cold Deserts of the US. We considered both provisional seed transfer zones (PSTZs), created using climate and stratified by ecoregion, and empirical seed transfer zones (ESTZs) for two species commonly used in restoration. Finally, we present a case study on fire occurrence within Northern Basin and Range greater sage-grouse Priority Areas for Conservation (PACs). Historic fire was effective for prioritizing seed zones: 23 of 132 PSTZs burned every year, and, within each ecoregion, two PSTZs comprised [greater double equals] 50% of the total area burned across all years. Similarly, fire disproportionately occurred in some ESTZs; in the Northern Basin and Range, one (Artemisia tridentata - 83%) or two zones (Pseudoroegneria spicata - 65%) made up a majority of total area burned. Fire occurrence within PACs largely reflected the PSTZ and ESTZ priorities found for the ecoregion, with small exceptions. Imperiled PSTZs (high proportion burned) in PACs largely reflected the patterns found across the ecoregion, while imperiled ESTZs departed from ecoregional patterns.

In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of nine different methods for estimating , using data simulated in the presence of linked selection. We find that methods that model the distribution of fitness effect (DFE) of both deleterious (as a gamma distribution) and beneficial mutations (as a gamma or exponential distribution) are the most accurate. We applied these methods to whole-genome data, finding that the most accurate methods gave average values of =0.25 in Arabidopsis thaliana, 0.5 in Drosophila melanogaster, and 0.1 in Homo sapiens. We also applied these methods to analyze subsets of tissue-specific genes in A. thaliana that are believed to be under different selective pressures and on genes found on the X vs. autosomes in D. melanogaster. We find estimates of  to be higher in the seeds than in other specialized organs, supporting inferences of conflict-driven adaptive evolution in genes expressed in the seed; we also find  to be higher on the X chromosome, supporting previous inferences of faster-X evolution.

    "abstract": "Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) are powerful model for stem cell research. However, due to the scarcity of GSCs in ovarian tissue, it is difficult to obtain the transcriptional profile of GSCs and identify novel GSC markers. In this study, we took advantage of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the germline cells and somatic cells in wild type Drosophila ovary. We then performed an in vivo RNAi screen and network analysis to identify genes that are involved in the early stages of germ cell differentiation. We identified 33 genes with limited expression during early germ cell development and identified 19 genes that potentially regulate germ cell differentiation. Among these, an uncharacterized gene, which we named eggplant (eggpl), is highly expressed in GSC and downregulated in early daughter cells. Upon RNAi knockdown of eggpl, we observed an increase in germ cell proliferation, an accumulation of cysts in the early mitotic (2- and 4-cell) stages and an increase in overall ovary size compared to control when flies were maintained on a standard diet. In flies fed a rich yeast diet, the expression of eggpl was significantly lower and the effects of eggpl RNAi were suppressed, suggesting that downregulation of eggpl may link nutritional status to germ cell proliferation and differentiation. We also found that the matrix metalloproteases, Mmp1 and Mmp2 as well as the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (Timp) are additional regulators of eggpl. Collectively, this study provides new insight into the signaling networks that regulate early germ cell development and identifies eggpl as a key player in this process.",

Inference of the population structure with such sequencing data is fundamentally important. However, the ultra-dimensionality and complicated linkage disequilibrium patterns across the whole genome make it challenging to infer population structure using traditional principal component analysis (PCA) based methods and software. We present the ERStruct Python Package, which enables the inference of population structure using whole-genome sequencing data. By leveraging parallel computing and GPU acceleration, our package achieves significant improvements in the speed of matrix operations for large-scale data. Additionally, our package features adaptive data splitting capabilities to facilitate computation on GPUs with limited memory.

    "abstract": "Many biomolecular condensates appear to form through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Individual condensate components can often undergo LLPS in vitro, capturing some features of the native structures. However, natural condensates contain dozens of components with different concentrations, dynamics, and contributions to compartment formation. Most biochemical reconstitutions of condensates have not benefitted from quantitative knowledge of these cellular features nor attempted to capture natural complexity. Here, we build on prior quantitative cellular studies to reconstitute yeast RNA processing bodies (P bodies) from purified components. Individually, five of the seven highly-concentrated P-body proteins form homotypic condensates at cellular protein and salt concentrations, using both structured domains and intrinsically disordered regions. Combining the seven proteins together at their cellular concentrations with RNA, yields phase separated droplets with partition coefficients and dynamics of most proteins in reasonable agreement with cellular values. The dynamics of most proteins in the reconstitution are also comparable to cellular values. RNA delays the maturation of proteins within, and promotes reversibility of, P bodies. Our ability to quantitatively recapitulate the composition and dynamics of a condensate from its most concentrated components suggests that simple interactions between these components carry much of the information that defines the physical properties of the cellular structure.",

    "abstract": "Metabolite concentrations shape cellular physiology and disease susceptibility, yet the general principles governing metabolome evolution are largely unknown. Here we introduce a measure of conservation of individual metabolite concentrations among related species. By analysing multispecies metabolome datasets in mammals and fruit flies, we show that conservation varies extensively across metabolites. Three major functional properties, metabolite abundance, essentiality and association with human diseases predict conservation, highlighting a striking parallel between the evolutionary forces driving metabolome and protein sequence conservation. Metabolic network simulations recapitulated these general patterns, and revealed that abundant metabolites are highly conserved due to their strong coupling to key metabolic fluxes in the network. This study uncovers simple rules governing metabolic evolution in animals and implies that most metabolome differences between species are permitted, rather than favored by selection. More broadly, our work paves the way towards using evolutionary information to discover biomarkers, as well as to detect pathogenic metabolome alterations in individual patients.",

A closely related sequence (GenBank record OK662577.1) from the whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei was deposited in 2021 under the name Penaeus vannamei picornavirus (PvPV). In 2022 another closely related sequence (GenBank accession: OP265432) was submitted under the name Penaeus vannamei solinvivirus (PvSV). In 2021, prior to the publication of PvPV and PvSV, we used an RT-PCR method devised from the sequence of KX883984.1 (described herein) to screen for WzSV8 in specimens of cultivated shrimp. Samples that gave positive RT-PCR results were subsequently tested by in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis to identify virus target tissues. Several tissues gave positive ISH results within morphologically normal nuclei. Thus, these tissues were of no use for diagnosis of WzSV8 by normal histological analysis. However, unique basophilic, cytoplasmic inclusions within vacuoles in the hepatopancreatic E-cells were also found in the same WzSV8-positive shrimp specimens, sometimes accompanied by a smaller eosinophilic inclusion. We call these Lightner double Inclusions (LDI) that can be considered pathognomonic for diagnosis of WzSV8 infection when detected using the light microscope. Although no current proof of WzSV8 is the cause of disease, it is important to investigate new viruses and related tissue anomalies, even from normal cultivated shrimp, to determine whether they may have any relationship to significant negative effects on the production of cultivated shrimp.",

    "abstract": "Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation has been shown to improve vestibular perception in healthy subjects. Here, we sought to obtain similar results using more natural stimuli consisting of small-amplitude motion perturbations of the whole body. Thirty participants were asked to report the perceived direction of antero-posterior sinusoidal motion on a MOOG platform. We compared the baseline perceptual thresholds with those obtained by applying small, stochastic perturbations at different power levels along the antero-posterior axis, symmetrically distributed around a zero-mean. At the population level, we found that the thresholds for all but the highest level of noise were significantly lower than the baseline threshold. At the individual level, the threshold was lower with at least one noise level than the threshold without noise in 87% of participants. Thus, small, stochastic oscillations of the whole body can increase the probability of detecting subthreshold vestibular signals, possibly due to stochastic resonance mechanisms. We suggest that, just as the external noise of the present experiments, also the spontaneous random oscillations of the body associated with standing posture are beneficial by enhancing vestibular thresholds with a mechanism similar to stochastic resonance. The results are also relevant from a clinical perspective, since they raise the possibility of improving motion perception in people with elevated thresholds due to aging or vestibulopathy by means of small-amplitude motion perturbations.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISmall-amplitude motion perturbations of the whole body improve vestibular perceptual thresholds of motion discrimination in young healthy people\nC_LIO_LIImprovements occur at optimal levels of noise amplitude, idiosyncratic to each subject\nC_LIO_LIThe findings are consistent with the phenomenon of stochastic resonance\nC_LIO_LIThe new method can applied to people with elevated thresholds due to aging or vestibulopathy\nC_LI",

Midbrain dopamine neurons are critical for reinforcement and their activation is sufficient for learning about cues, actions, and outcomes. Here we examine in detail the mechanisms underlying the ability of ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) dopamine neurons to support instrumental learning. By exploiting numerous behavioral tasks in combination with time-limited optogenetic manipulations, we reveal that VTA and SNc dopamine neurons generate reinforcement through separable psychological processes. VTA dopamine neurons imbue actions and their associated cues with motivational value that allows flexible and persistent pursuit whereas SNc dopamine neurons support time-limited, precise, action-specific learning that is non-scalable and inflexible. This architecture is reminiscent of actor-critic reinforcement learning models with VTA and SNc instructing the critic and actor, respectively. Our findings indicate that heterogeneous dopamine systems support unique forms of instrumental learning that ultimately result in disparate reward-seeking strategies.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that irony is one of the most challenging forms of communication, consequently, it can be a valuable indicator of communication abilities. An ironic statement transmits the opposite meaning of its literal counterpart. The cognitive processes that may support the interpretation of irony include the Theory of Mind (ToM), executive functions, and processing style. The brain areas associated with irony detection are the medial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule, among others. This study aims to analyze the cognitive processes and neural correlates involved in irony detection in Mexican adults. Forty-five participants underwent a cognitive assessment and performed a contextual discrepancy task during fMRI acquisition. The behavioral results showed that the detection of nonliteral statements (irony, unrelated, and white lies) requires ToM and verbal abilities. In addition, white lies detection seemed to involve inhibitory control. Ironic statements were the hardest intention to detect, having the lowest percentage of classification and the slowest latency of classification. Irony detection involved brain areas associated with the ToM (i.e., precuneus) and language (i.e., IFG and pSTG) as was expected based on the results of previous studies. The detection of literal and unrelated statements recruited motor areas. No differential activation pattern was found for detection of white lies. Finally, a global perceptual processing style predicted the percent change in the BOLD signal in the IFG for all the nonliteral and literal statements.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activation is essential for action potential generation in the brain. Allosteric calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonist, cinacalcet, strongly and ubiquitously inhibits VGSC currents in neocortical neurons via an unidentified, G-protein-dependent blocking molecule. The mechanisms by which VGSC characteristics influence cinacalcet-mediated inhibition are not well understood. Here, using whole-cell patch clamp methods, we investigated the voltage-dependence of cinacalcet-mediated inhibition of VGSCs and the channel state preference of cinacalcet. The rate of inhibition of VGSC currents was accelerated at more depolarized holding potentials. Cinacalcet shifted the voltage-dependence of both fast and slow inactivation of VGSCs in the hyperpolarizing direction. Utilizing a simple model, the voltage-dependence of VGSC current inhibition may be explained if the affinity of the blocking molecule to the channel states follows the sequence: fast-inactivated > slow-inactivated > resting. The state dependence of block contributes to the non-linearity of action potential block by cinacalcet. This dynamic and abundant signaling pathway by which G-proteins regulate VGSC currents provides an important voltage-dependent mechanism for modulating central neuronal excitability.\n\nKey points summaryVoltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the action potential generation and propagation that is central to physiological function in excitable cells. VGSC inhibitors are useful therapies to treat epilepsy, pain, and cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nCinacalcet inhibits VGSC currents strongly and the underlying G-protein dependent signaling pathway occurs in the vast majority of neocortical and hippocampal neurons.\n\nHere we demonstrate that cinacalcet inhibits the VGSC current by activating a downstream blocking molecule that preferentially binds to the fast-inactivated state, that the blocking molecule stabilizes the inactivated states, and that cinacalcet impacts neuronal excitability in a non-linear manner.\n\nCharacterization of the mechanism by which cinacalcet operates will facilitate the determination of its role in regulating neocortical excitability and the identification of new therapeutic targets for epilepsy, pain, and arrythmias.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to heavy metals has been shown to cause damage to a variety of different tissues and cell types including hair cells, the sensory cells of our inner ears responsible for hearing and balance. Elevated levels of one such metal, cadmium, have been associated with hearing loss and shown to cause hair cell death in multiple experimental models. While the mechanisms of cadmium-induced cell death have been extensively studied in other cell types they remain relatively unknown in hair cells. We have found that calcium signaling, which is known to play a role in cadmium-induced cell death in other cell types through calmodulin and CaMKII activation as well as IP3 receptor and mitochondrial calcium uniporter mediated calcium flow, does not appear to play a significant role in cadmium-induced hair cell death. While calmodulin inhibition can partially protect hair cells this may be due to impacts on mechanotransduction activity. Removal of extracellular calcium, and inhibiting CaMKII, the IP3 receptor and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter all failed to protect against cadmium-induced hair cell death. We also found cadmium treatment increased pAkt levels in hair cells and pERK levels in supporting cells. This activation may be protective as inhibiting these pathways enhances cadmium-induced hair cell death rather than protecting cells. Thus cadmium-induced hair cell death appears distinct from cadmium-induced cell death in other cell types where calcium, Akt and ERK signaling all promote cell death.",

    "abstract": "Flexible computation is a hallmark of intelligent behavior. Yet, little is known about how neural networks contextually reconfigure for different computations. Humans are able to perform a new task without extensive training, presumably through the composition of elementary processes that were previously learned. Cognitive scientists have long hypothesized the possibility of a compositional neural code, where complex neural computations are made up of constituent components; however, the neural substrate underlying this structure remains elusive in biological and artificial neural networks. Here we identified an algorithmic neural substrate for compositional computation through the study of multitasking artificial recurrent neural networks. Dynamical systems analyses of networks revealed learned computational strategies that mirrored the modular subtask structure of the task-set used for training. Dynamical motifs such as attractors, decision boundaries and rotations were reused across different task computations. For example, tasks that required memory of a continuous circular variable repurposed the same ring attractor. We show that dynamical motifs are implemented by clusters of units and are reused across different contexts, allowing for flexibility and generalization of previously learned computation. Lesioning these clusters resulted in modular effects on network performance: a lesion that destroyed one dynamical motif only minimally perturbed the structure of other dynamical motifs. Finally, modular dynamical motifs could be reconfigured for fast transfer learning. After slow initial learning of dynamical motifs, a subsequent faster stage of learning reconfigured motifs to perform novel tasks. This work contributes to a more fundamental understanding of compositional computation underlying flexible general intelligence in neural systems. We present a conceptual framework that establishes dynamical motifs as a fundamental unit of computation, intermediate between the neuron and the network. As more whole brain imaging studies record neural activity from multiple specialized systems simultaneously, the framework of dynamical motifs will guide questions about specialization and generalization across brain regions.",

    "abstract": "How bacterial strains within a complex human microbiota collectively shape intestinal T cell homeostasis is not well-understood. Methods that quickly identify effector strains or species that drive specific mucosal T cell phenotypes are needed to define general principles for how the microbiota modulates host immunity. We colonize germ-free mice with defined communities of cultured strains and profile antigen-specific responses directed towards individual strains ex vivo. We find that lamina propria T cells are specific to bacterial strains at the species level and can discriminate between strains of the same species. Ex vivo restimulations consistently identify the strains within complex communities that induce Th17 responses in vivo providing the potential to shape baseline immune tone via community composition. Using an adoptive transfer model of colitis, we find that lamina propria T cells respond to different bacterial strains in conditions of inflammation versus homeostasis. Collectively, our approach represents a novel method for efficiently predicting the relative impact of individual bacterial strains within a complex community and for parsing microbiota-dependent phenotypes into component fractions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDetermining the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome modulates the host immune system has translational potential for treating or preventing immune mediated disease. A key challenge is identifying the immunogenic bacterial strains in the setting of a complex microbiota. We use a combination of anaerobic culturing, in vitro T cell assays, gnotobiotic mouse models, and ex vivo T cell restimulations to explore the influence of species and strain diversity on the specificity of mucosal T cells. Our approach efficiently predicts the relative impact of individual bacterial strains within a complex community and can be used to parse microbiota-dependent phenotypes into component fractions.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater influent microorganisms are part of the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) and affect the activated sludge (AS) microbial community. Precise modeling of AS processes requires accurate quantification of influent microorganisms, which is missing in many AS models (ASMs). In this study, influent microorganisms in COD unit were determined using a fast quantification method based on DNA yield and was compared with conventional respirometry method. The actively growing influent microorganisms were identified. A mass-flow immigration model was developed to quantify the influent-to-AS immigration efficiency (mi) of specific taxon i using mass balance and 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing data. The modelled average m was 0.121-0.257 in site 1 (LaPrairie), and 0.050-0.126 in site 2 (Pincourt), which were corrected to 0.111-0.186 and 0.048-0.109 respectively using a constrain of mi [&le;] 1. The model was further developed to calculate contributions to organic substrate consumption by specific taxa. Those genera with zero or negative net growth rates were not completely immigration dependent (mi < 1) and contributed to 2.4% - 5.4% of the substrate consumption. These results suggest that influent microbiome may be important contributors to AS microbiome assembly and system performance (substrate consumption), which may help to improve future AS process modelling and design.\n\nSynopsisInfluent microbial immigration lacks detailed taxon-specific quantification. This study presents quantitative methods and models for influent biomass, mass-flow immigration model, and resource consumption in activated sludge.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=106 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/504022v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d6b43forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d3b7eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cfaef5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e75bdb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMonkeypox is a zoonotic virus which persists in animal reservoirs and periodically spills over into humans, causing outbreaks. During the current 2022 outbreak, monkeypox virus has persisted via human-human transmission, across all major continents and for longer than any previous record. This unprecedented spread creates the potential for the virus to  spillback into local susceptible animal populations. Persistent transmission amongst such animals raises the prospect of monkeypox virus becoming enzootic in new regions. However, the full and specific range of potential animal hosts and reservoirs of monkeypox remains unknown, especially in newly at-risk non-endemic areas.\n\nMethodsHere, utilising ensembles of classifiers comprising different class balancing techniques and incorporating instance weights, we identify which animal species are potentially susceptible to monkeypox virus. Subsequently, we generate spatial distribution maps to highlight high-risk geographic areas at high resolution.\n\nFindingsWe show that the number of potentially susceptible species is currently underestimated by 2.4 to 4.3-fold, and that a high density of wild susceptible species are native to Europe. We provide lists of these species, and highlight high-risk hosts for spillback and potential long-term reservoirs, which may enable monkeypox virus to become endemic.\n\nInterpretationWe highlight the European red fox and brown rat, as they have established interactions with potentially contaminated urban waste and sewage, which provides a mechanism for potential spillback. We anticipate that our results will enable targeted active surveillance of potential spillback event, to minimise risk of the virus becoming endemic in these regions. Our results also indicate the potential of domesticated cats and dogs (latter now confirmed) being susceptible to monkeypox virus, and hence support many health organisations advice for infected humans to avoid physical interaction with pets.",

    "abstract": "APOBEC3 proteins (A3s) are enzymes that catalyze deamination of cytidine to uridine in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates, thus playing a key role in innate antiviral immunity. However, APOBEC3 family has also been linked to many mutational signatures in cancer cells, which has led to intense interest to develop inhibitors of A3s catalytic activity as therapeutics as well as tools to study A3s biochemistry, structure and cellular function. Recent studies have shown that ssDNA containing 2'-deoxy-zebularine (dZ-ssDNA) is an inhibitor of A3s such as A3A, A3B and A3G, although atomic determinants of this activity remained unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we determined a 1.5 [A] resolution structure of a dZ-ssDNA inhibitor bound to active A3G. The crystal structure revealed that the activated dZ/H2O mimics the transition state by coordinating the active site Zn2+ and engaging in additional stabilizing interactions, such as the one with the catalytic residues E259. Therefore, this structure allowed us to capture the first snapshot of the A3s transition state, and suggests that developing transition-state mimicking inhibitors may provide a new opportunity to design more targeted molecules for A3s in the future.",

Studies reveal a link between BPA exposure and vascular disease in human populations, whereas the vascular effects of BPA substitutes remain largely unknown.\n\nObjectivesTo determine the effect of BPS, a commonly used BPA substitute, on redox balance, nitric oxide (NO) availability and microvascular NO-dependent dilation.\n\nMethodsIn human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO after exposure to BPS was measured using fluorescent probes for DCFDA and DAF-FM diacetate, respectively. The contribution of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling to ROS generation was determined by measuring ROS in the presence or absence of an eNOS inhibitor (L-NAME) or eNOS co-factor, BH4, while the contribution of mitochondria-derived ROS was determined by treating cells with mitochondria-specific antioxidants prior to BPS exposure. Bioenergetic profiles were assessed using Seahorse extracellular flux analysis and mitochondria membrane polarization was measured with TMRE and JC-1 assays. In a mouse model of low dose BPS exposure, NO-mediated endothelial function was assessed in pressurized microvessels by inducing endothelium-dependent dilation in the presence or absence of L-NAME.\n\nResultsBPS exposure ([&ge;] 25 nM) reduced NO and increased ROS production in HUVEC, the latter corrected by treating cells with L-NAME or BH4. BPS exposure led to a loss of mitochondria membrane potential but had no impact on bioenergetic parameters except for a decrease in the spare respiratory capacity. Treatment of HUVEC with mitochondria-specific antioxidants abolished the effect of BPS on NO and ROS. NO-mediated vasodilation was impaired in male mice exposed to BPS.\n\nDiscussionExposure to BPS may promote cardiovascular disease by perturbing NO-mediated vascular homeostasis through the induction of oxidative stress.",

Despite the fact that cognitive impairments are a common feature of ciliopathies, how cilia dysfunction affects neuronal development has not been characterized in detail. Here, we show that the primary cilium is required cell-autonomously by neurons during neural circuit formation. In particular, the primary cilium is crucial during axonal pathfinding for the switch in responsiveness of axons at a choice point, or intermediate target. Utilizing animal models and in vivo, ex vivo, as well as in vitro experiments, we provide evidence for a critical role of the primary cilium in long-range axon guidance. The primary cilium on the cell body of commissural neurons transduces long-range guidance signals sensed by growth cones navigating an intermediate target. In extension of our finding that Shh is required for the rostral turn of post-crossing commissural axons, we show here that the cilium is required for a transcriptional change of axon guidance receptors, which in turn mediate the repulsive response to floorplate-derived Shh shown by post-crossing commissural axons.",

    "abstract": "The multiple-demand (MD) network is sensitive to many aspects of cognitive demand, showing increased activation with more difficult tasks. However, it is currently unknown whether the MD network is modulated by the context in which task difficulty is experienced. Using fMRI, we examined MD network responses to low, medium, and high difficulty arithmetic problems within two cued contexts, an easy versus a hard set. The results showed that MD activity varied reliably with the absolute difficulty of a problem, independent of the context in which the problem was presented. Similarly, MD activity during task execution was independent of the difficulty of the previous trial. Representational similarity analysis further supported that representational distances in the MD network were consistent with a context-independent code. Finally, we identified several regions outside the MD network that showed context-dependent coding, including the inferior parietal lobule, paracentral lobule, posterior insula, and large areas of the visual cortex. In sum, cognitive effort is processed by the MD network in a context-independent manner. We suggest that this absolute coding of cognitive demand in the MD network reflects the limited range of task difficulty that can be supported by the cognitive apparatus.",

However, the signals required for this coordinated intercellular crosstalk remain largely unknown. Here, we describe how the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway controls the fate of fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), the cellular origin of intramuscular fat (IMAT) and fibrotic scar tissue. Using conditional mutagenesis and pharmacological Hh modulators in vivo and in vitro, we identify DHH as the key ligand that acts as a potent adipogenic brake by preventing the adipogenic differentiation of FAPs. Hh signaling also impacts muscle regeneration, albeit indirectly through induction of myogenic factors in FAPs. Our results also indicate that ectopic and sustained Hh activation forces FAPs to adopt a fibrogenic fate resulting in widespread fibrosis. In this work, we reveal novel post-developmental functions of Hh signaling in balancing tissue regeneration and fatty fibrosis. Moreover, they provide the exciting possibility that mis-regulation of the Hh pathway with age and disease could be a major driver of pathological IMAT formation.",

    "abstract": "Pesticide resistance provides one of the best examples of rapid evolution to environmental change. The Colorado potato beetle has a long and noteworthy history as a super-pest due to its ability to repeatedly develop resistance to novel insecticides and rapidly expand its geographic and host plant range. Here, we investigate regional differences in demography, recombination and selection using whole genome resequencing data from two highly resistant CPB populations in the United States (Hancock, Wisconsin and Long Island, New York). Demographic reconstruction corroborates historical records for a single pest origin during the colonization of the Midwestern and Eastern United States in the mid-to late-19th century and suggests that the effective population size might be higher in Long Island, NY than Hancock, WI despite contemporary potato acreage of Wisconsin being far greater. Population-based recombination maps show similar background recombination rates between these populations, as well as overlapping regions of low recombination that intersect with important metabolic detoxification genes. In both populations, we find compelling evidence for hard selective sweeps linked to insecticide resistance with multiple sweeps involving genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism, stress response, and defensive chemistry. Notably, only two candidate insecticide resistance genes are shared among both populations, but both appear to be independent hard selective sweep events. This suggests that repeated, rapid, and independent evolution of genes may underlie CPBs pest status among geographically distinct populations.",

They have been documented in the heart of some of the most urbanized cities, such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City. Here, we explored the genomic composition of coyotes in the New York metropolitan area to investigate if genomic demography and admixture differs from expected for urban-dwelling canids. We identified moderate-to-high estimates of relatedness among coyotes living in Queens and adjacent neighborhoods, suggestive of a relatively small population. Although we found low background levels of domestic dog ancestry across most coyotes in our sample, we identified a male suspected to be a first-generation coyote-dog hybrid, as well as his two putative backcrossed offspring that carried approximately 25% dog ancestry. The male coyote-dog hybrid and one backcrossed offspring each carried two mutations that are known to increase human-directed hypersociability in dogs and gray wolves. An additional, unrelated coyote with little dog ancestry also carries two of these mutations. These genetic patterns suggest that gene flow from domestic dogs may become an increasingly important consideration as coyotes continue to inhabit metropolitan regions.",

Given any edit to the CMP (e.g., changing cellular localization), CPSA outputs the genomic loci in the alignment corresponding to the edit. We confirm that three CMPs (single-cell gene expression distributions of the immune system and of embryogenesis, and tissue organization of the tumor microenvironment) have templates: the loci output by CPSA for therapeutically significant edits of these CMPs reveal genes, regulatory regions and active-sites whose experimental manipulation causes the edits. Our theory provides a systematic framework for genetically redesigning CMPs.",

Acute gene silencing is determined in the presence of the piRNAi extra-chromosomal array and inherited silencing after loss of the piRNA trigger. This assay has the advantage of targeting endogenous genes that are easily scored in mutant backgrounds and obviates the need for mutant validation and genetic crosses, which can influence inherited silencing. Here we show an example of the assay by testing acute and inherited piRNA-mediated him-5 silencing in ribonucleotidyltransferase rde-3 (ne3370) mutant animals. In the absence of rde-3, acute silencing was reduced but still detectable, whereas inherited silencing was abolished.",

    "abstract": "Perturbation to the redox state accompanies many diseases and its effects are viewed through oxidation of biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The thiol groups of protein cysteine residues undergo an array of redox post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are important for regulation of protein and pathway function. To better understand what proteins are redox regulated following a perturbation, it is important to be able to comprehensively profile protein thiol oxidation at the proteome level. Herein, we report a deep redox proteome profiling workflow and demonstrate its application in measuring the changes in thiol oxidation along with global protein expression in skeletal muscle from mdx mice, a model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). In depth coverage of the thiol proteome was achieved with >18,000 Cys sites from 5608 proteins in muscle being quantified. Compared to the control group, mdx mice exhibit markedly increased thiol oxidation, where ~2% shift in the median oxidation occupancy was observed. Pathway analysis for the redox data revealed that coagulation system and immune-related pathways were among the most susceptible to increased thiol oxidation in mdx mice, whereas protein abundance changes were more enriched in pathways associated with bioenergetics. This study illustrates the importance of deep redox profiling in gaining a greater insight into oxidative stress regulation and pathways/processes being perturbed in an oxidizing environment.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=190 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/504013v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (74K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1917f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1730cd0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4e4820org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1615f4c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIDeep redox profiling workflow results in stoichiometric quantification of thiol oxidation for > 18,000 Cys sites in muscle\nC_LIO_LIThiol redox changes were much more pronounced than protein abundance changes for the overlapping set of proteins\nC_LIO_LIRedox changes are most significant in coagulation and immune response pathways while abundance changes on bioenergetics pathways\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The experience of the self as an embodied agent in the world is an essential aspect of human consciousness. This experience arises from the feeling of control over ones bodily actions, termed the Sense of Agency (SoA), and the feeling that the body belongs to the self, Body Ownership (BO). Despite long-standing philosophical and scientific interest in the relationship between the body and brain, the neural systems involved in SoA and BO and especially their interactions, are not yet understood. In this preregistered study using the Moving Rubber Hand Illusion inside an MR-scanner, we aimed to uncover the relationship between BO & SoA in the human brain. Importantly, by using both visuomotor and visuotactile stimulations and measuring online trial-by-trial fluctuations in the illusion magnitude, we were able to disentangle brain systems related to objective sensory stimulation and subjective judgments of the bodily-self. Our results indicate that at both the behavioral and neural levels, BO and SoA are strongly interrelated. Multisensory regions in the occipital and fronto-parietal regions encoded convergence of sensory stimulation conditions. However, the subjective judgments of bodily-self were also related to BOLD fluctuations in regions not activated by the sensory conditions such as the insular cortex and precuneus. Our results highlight the convergence of multisensory processing in specific neural systems for both BO and SoA with partially dissociable regions for subjective judgments in regions of the default mode network.",

    "abstract": "It remains poorly understood how SARS-CoV-2 infection influences the physiological host factors important for aerosol transmission. We assessed breathing pattern, exhaled droplets, and infectious virus after infection with Alpha and Delta variants of concern (VOC) in the Syrian hamster. Both VOCs displayed a confined window of detectable airborne virus (24h - 48h), shorter than compared to oropharyngeal swabs. The loss of airborne shedding was linked to airway constriction resulting in a decrease of fine aerosols produced. Male sex was associated with increased viral replication and virus shedding in the air, including a VOC-independent particle-profile shift towards smaller droplets. Transmission efficiency varied among donors, including a superspreading event. Co-infection with VOCs only occurred when both viruses were shed by the same donor during an increased exposure timeframe. This highlights that assessment of host and virus factors resulting in a differential exhaled particle profile is critical for understanding airborne transmission.",

    "abstract": "Skin ageing is defined in part by collagen depletion and fragmentation that leads to a loss of mechanical tension. This is currently believed to reflect, in part, the accumulation of senescent cells. We compared the expression of genes and proteins for components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as their regulators and found that senescent cells produced more matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) than proliferating cells from adult and neonatal donors. This was consistent with senescent cells contributing to increased matrix degradation with age; however, cells from adult donors proved significantly less capable of producing new collagen than neonatal or senescent cells, and they showed significantly lower myofibroblast activation as determined by the marker -SMA. Functionally, adult cells also showed slower migration than neonatal cells. We concluded that while increased collagen degradation with age might reflect senescent cell accumulation, the reduced collagen production that prevents the skin from maintaining homeostasis must reflect senescence-independent processes.",

Unfortunately, the presence of pupa cuticle on many Drosophila tissues during metamorphosis prevents enzyme access to cells and has limited the use of enzymatic in situ methods for assessing chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. Here, we present a dissociation method for cuticle-bound pupal tissues that is optimized for use with ATAC-Seq and CUT&RUN to interrogate chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. We show this method provides comparable chromatin accessibility data to the non-enzymatic approach FAIRE-seq, with only a fraction of the amount of input tissue required. This approach is also compatible with CUT&RUN, which allows genome-wide mapping of histone modifications with less than 1/10th of the tissue input required for more conventional approaches such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq). Our protocol makes it possible to use newer, more sensitive enzymatic in situ approaches to interrogate gene regulatory networks during Drosophila metamorphosis.",

Like canonical P-bodies found in somatic cells, \"germline P-bodies\" contain regulators of mRNA decapping and deadenylation and, in addition, the intrinsically-disordered proteins MEG-1 and MEG-2 and the TIS11-family RNA-binding protein POS-1. Embryos lacking meg-1 and meg-2 do not stabilize P-body components, miss-regulate POS-1 targets, miss-specify the germline founder cell, and do not develop a germline.

Seed mucilage is a common, convergently-evolved trait found in thousands of plant species. When wetted, the seed coat swells into a viscid mass; when dried, the mucilage strands strongly cement the seed to whatever it is in contact with.\nC_LIO_LIThis binding to the ground has been previously shown to protect seeds from granivory. Previous research found both that mucilage volume - and the correlated attachment strength - are higher in species from hot, dry, areas suggesting an environmental component of this traits function.\nC_LIO_LIHere we (1) quantified the effect of temperature on attachment across many species in a lab setting, (2) tested the potential mechanism behind this correlation by accelerating desiccation speed without changing temperature, and (3) tested whether these relationships introduce context dependency of the defensive function of mucilage in the field, using field trials with harvester ants.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that (1) increasing temperature during mucilage drying strongly reduced the force needed to dislodge seeds for most species, (2) drying time was likely the driving mechanism behind the loss of attachment strength at higher temperatures, not temperature per se, (3) seeds attached to substrate during higher temperatures or under accelerated drying conditions were far more susceptible to granivory.\nC_LIO_LI Synthesis These results show not only the mechanism behind an abiotic modification of a functional trait of seeds, but that this change majorly alters a key interaction contributing to seed survival.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe persistent organochlorine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is banned world-wide due to its negative health effects and persistence in the environment. It is exceptionally used as an insecticide for malaria control. Exposure occurs in regions where DDT is applied, as well as in the arctic where its endocrine disrupting metabolite, p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p-DDE) accumulates in marine mammals and fish. DDT and p,p-DDE exposures are linked to birth defects, infertility, cancer, and neurodevelopmental delays. Of particular concern is the potential of DDT use to impact the health of generations to come. Generational effects of toxicant exposures have been described in animal models and implicated germline epigenetic factors. Similar generational effects have been shown in epidemiological studies. Although advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating this epigenetic inheritance have been made, there remain major knowledge gaps in how this occurs in humans. In animal and human models, DNA methylation (DNAme) has been implicated in paternal epigenetic effects. In animal models, histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) has been shown to be responsive to the paternal environment and linked with epigenetic transmission to the embryo. Our objectives were to define the associations between p,p-DDE serum levels and alterations in the sperm methylome and H3K4me3 enrichment using next generation sequencing. We aimed to compare regions of epigenomic sensitivity between geographically diverse populations with different routes and levels of exposures, and to identify interactions between altered DNAme and H3K4me3 regions. The potential for p,p-DDE to impact the health of the next generation was explored by examining the functions of the genomic regions impacted, their roles during embryo development, and in health and disease.\n\nMethodsIn the Limpopo Province of South Africa, we recruited 247 VhaVenda South African men from 12 villages that either used indoor residual spraying with DDT for malaria control or not. We selected 49 paired blood and semen samples, from men that ranged from 18 to 32 years of age (mean 25 years). Sample inclusion was based on normal sperm counts (> 15 million/ml), normal sperm DNA fragmentation index, and testing a range of p,p-DDE exposure levels (mean 10,462.228 {+/-} 1,792.298 ng/ml). From a total of 193 samples, 47 Greenlandic Inuit blood and semen paired samples were selected from the biobank of the INUENDO cohort. The subjects ranged from 20 to 44 years of age (mean 31 years), were born in Greenland, and all had proven fertility. Sample selection was based on obtaining a range of p,p-DDE exposure levels (mean 870.734 {+/-} 134.030 ng/ml). Here we determined the molecular responses at the level of the sperm epigenome to serum p,p-DDE levels using MethylC-Capture-seq (MCC-seq) and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identified genomic regions with altered DNA methylation (DNAme) and differential enrichment of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in sperm. We used in silico analyses to discover regions of differential methylation associated with p,p-DDE levels that were predicted to be transmitted and persist in the embryo.\n\nResultsAlterations in DNAme and H3K4me3 enrichment followed dose response-like trends, and we identified overlapping genomic regions with DNAme sensitivities in both populations. Altered DNAme and H3K4me3 in sperm occurred at transposable elements and regulatory regions involved in fertility, disease, development, and neurofunction. A subset of regions with altered sperm DNAme and H3K4me3 were predicted to persist in the pre-implantation embryo and were associated with embryonic gene expression.\n\nLimitationsThe samples were collected from remote areas of the world thus sample size is relatively small. The populations differed in the routes of exposure, timing of collection, mean age (mean of 25 versus 31 years of age in South African and Greenlandic populations respectively) and in the timing of p,p-DDE measurement. Moreover, the Greenlandic Inuit men were proven fertile whereas the fertility status of the South African men was unknown. Confounding factors such as other environmental exposures and selection bias cannot be ruled out.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that in men, DDT and p,p-DDE exposure impacts the sperm epigenome in a dose-responsive manner and may negatively impact the health of future generations through epigenetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The short arms of the human acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 share large homologous regions, including the ribosomal DNA repeats and extended segmental duplications (Floutsakou et al. 2013; van Sluis et al. 2019). While the complete assembly of these regions in the Telomere-to-Telomere consortiums CHM13 provided a model of their homology (Nurk et al. 2022), it remained unclear if these patterns were ancestral or maintained by ongoing recombination exchange. Here, we show that acrocentric chromosomes contain pseudo-homologous regions (PHRs) indicative of recombination between non-homologs. Considering an all-to-all comparison of the high-quality human pangenome from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) (Liao et al. 2022), we find that contigs from all of the acrocentric short arms form a community similar to those formed by single chromosomes or the sex chromosome pair. A variation graph (Garrison et al. 2018) constructed from centromere-spanning acrocentric contigs indicates the presence of regions where most contigs appear nearly identical between heterologous CHM13 acrocentrics. Except on chromosome 15, we observe faster decay of linkage disequilibrium in the PHRs than in the corresponding short and long arms, indicating higher rates of recombination (N. Li and Stephens 2003; Huttley et al. 1999). The PHRs include sequences previously shown to lie at the breakpoint of Robertsonian translocations (Jarmuz-Szymczak et al. 2014), and we show that their arrangement is compatible with crossover in inverted duplications on chromosomes 13, 14, and 21. The ubiquity of signals of recombination between heterologous chromosomes seen in the HPRC draft pangenomes acrocentric assemblies suggests that these shared sequences form the basis for recurrent Robertsonian translocations, providing sequence and population-based confirmation of hypotheses first developed cytogenetically fifty years ago (Hamerton et al. 1975).",

    "abstract": "Biobanks that collect deep phenotypic and genomic data across large numbers of individuals have emerged as a key resource for human genetic research. However, phenotypes acquired as part of Biobanks are often missing across many individuals, limiting the utility of these datasets. The ability to accurately impute or \"fill-in\" missing phenotypes is critical to harness the power of population-scale Biobank datasets. We propose AutoComplete, a deep learning-based imputation method which can accurately impute missing phenotypes in population-scale Biobank datasets. When applied to collections of phenotypes measured across {approx} 300K individuals from the UK Biobank, AutoComplete improved imputation accuracy over existing 2 methods (average improvement in r2 of 18% for all phenotypes and 42% for binary phenotypes). We explored the utility of phenotype imputation for improving the power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by applying our method to a group of five clinically relevant traits with an average missigness rate of 83% (67% to 94%) leading to an an increase in effective sample size of {approx}2-fold on average (0.5 to 3.3-fold across the phenotypes). GWAS on the resulting imputed phenotypes led to an increase in the total number of loci significantly associated to the traits from four to 129. Our results demonstrate the utility of deep-learning based imputation to increase power for genetic discoveries in existing biobank data sets.",

    "abstract": "Proteins often act through oligomeric interactions with other proteins. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy provide detailed information on the structures of biological assemblies, defined as the most likely biologically relevant structures derived from experimental data. In crystal structures, the most relevant assembly may be ambiguously determined, since multiple assemblies observed in the crystal lattice may be plausible. It is estimated that 10-15% of PDB entries may have incorrect or ambiguous assembly annotations. Accurate assemblies are required for understanding functional data and training of deep learning methods for predicting assembly structures. As with any other kind of biological data, replication via multiple independent experiments provides important validation for the determination of biological assembly structures. Here we present the Protein Common Assembly Database (ProtCAD), which presents clusters of protein assembly structures observed in independent structure determinations of homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). ProtCAD is searchable by PDB entry, UniProt identifiers, or Pfam domain designations and provides downloads of coordinate files, PyMol scripts, and publicly available assembly annotations for each cluster of assemblies. About 60% of PDB entries contain assemblies in clusters of at least 2 independent experiments. All clusters and coordinates are available on ProtCAD web site (http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/protcad).",

    "abstract": "The tricarboxylic citric acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) is a tumor suppressor. When lost in cells, its substrate fumarate accumulates to mM levels and drives oncogenic signaling and transformation. Germline alterations lead to an autosomal dominant condition known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) where patients are predisposed to various benign tumors and an aggressive form of kidney cancer. FH alterations of unclear significance are frequently observed with germline testing; thus, there is an unmet need to classify FH variants by their cancer-associated risk, allowing for screening, early diagnosis and treatment. Here we quantify catalytic efficiency of 74 FH variants of uncertain significance. Over half were enzymatically inactive which is strong evidence of pathogenicity. We generated a panel of HLRCC cell lines expressing FH variants with a range of catalytic activities, then correlated fumarate levels with metabolic features. We found that fumarate accumulation blocks purine biosynthesis, rendering FH-deficient cells reliant on purine salvage to maintain purine nucleotide pools. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the purine salvage pathway reduced HLRCC tumor growth in vivo. Together, these findings suggest pathogenicity of many patient-associated FH variants and reveal purine salvage as a targetable vulnerability in FH-deficient tumors.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThis study functionally characterizes patient-associated FH variants with unknown significance for pathogenicity. This study also reveals nucleotide salvage pathways as a targetable feature of FH-deficient cancers, which are shown to be sensitive to the purine salvage pathway inhibitor 6-mercaptopurine. This presents a new rapidly translatable treatment strategy for FH-deficient cancers.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway is common in melanoma but efforts to drug this pathway have proven largely ineffective in patients. In this study, we observed that pharmacological inhibition of AKT was ineffective whereas genetic silencing of all three AKT paralogs significantly abrogated melanoma cell growth through effects on mTORC signaling. This phenotype could be rescued by overexpression of AKT but was dependent on kinase activity. Interestingly, expression of the serine/threonine kinase SGK1 was increased following genetic suppression of AKT but only expression of activated SGK1 could rescue the lethal effect of AKT knockdown. SGK1 also increases tumor growth and decreases survival in a BRAFV600E-driven mouse model of melanoma. Pharmacological inhibition of SGK and AKT reduced cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that SGK1 can compensate for AKT loss in this context and suggest that dual targeting of SGK1 and AKT may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in this disease.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAlthough the AKT1, 2 & 3 genes encode: Bona fide oncoprotein kinases; well-validated downstream effectors of PI3-lipids and: pleiotropic regulators of numerous aberrant properties of cancer cells, their role in melanoma progression and/or maintenance is poorly understood. Here we explore the effects of genetic or pharmacological inhibitors of AKT1-3 and conclude that combined inhibition of AKT plus the related SGK protein kinases may be required to inhibit melanomagenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdverse pathophysiological and behavioral outcomes related to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic pain are common following blast exposure and contribute to decreased quality of life, but underlying mechanisms and prophylactic/treatment options remain limited. The dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system helps regulate behavioral and inflammatory responses to stress and injury; however, it has yet to be investigated as a potential mechanism in either humans or animals exposed to blast. We hypothesized that blast-induced KOR activation mediates adverse outcomes related to inflammation and affective behavioral response.\n\nMethodsC57Bl/6 adult male mice were singly or repeatedly exposed to either sham (anesthesia only) or blast delivered by a pneumatic shock tube. The selective KOR antagonist norBNI or vehicle (saline) was administered 72 hours prior to repetitive blast or sham exposure. Serum and brain were collected 10 minutes or 4 hours post-exposure for dynorphin A-like immunoreactivity and cytokine measurements, respectively. At one-month post-exposure, mice were tested in a series of behavioral assays related to adverse outcomes reported by humans with blast trauma.\n\nResultsRepetitive but not single blast exposure resulted in increased brain dynorphin A-like immunoreactivity. norBNI pretreatment blocked or significantly reduced blast-induced increase in serum and brain cytokines, including IL-6, at 4 hours post exposure and aversive/anxiety-like behavioral dysfunction at one month post exposure.\n\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate a previously unreported role for the dynorphin/KOR system as a mediator of biochemical and behavioral dysfunction following repetitive blast exposure and highlight this system as a potential prophylactic/therapeutic treatment target.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellar granule cell layer has inspired numerous theoretical models of neural representations that support learned behaviors, beginning with the work of Marr and Albus. In these models, granule cells form a sparse, combinatorial encoding of diverse sensorimotor inputs. Such sparse representations are optimal for learning to discriminate random stimuli. However, recent observations of dense, low-dimensional activity across granule cells have called into question the role of sparse coding in these neurons. Here, we generalize theories of cerebellar learning to determine the optimal granule cell representation for tasks beyond random stimulus discrimination, including continuous input-output transformations as required for smooth motor control. We show that for such tasks, the optimal granule cell representation is substantially denser than predicted by classic theories. Our results provide a general theory of learning in cerebellum-like systems and suggest that optimal cerebellar representations are task-dependent.",

    "abstract": "We have shown that excess B-cell activating factor (BAFF) in the blood of HIV-infected individuals, is concomitant with increased frequencies of precursor-like marginal zone (MZp) B-cells, early on and despite successful antiretroviral therapy (ART). We have recently reported that in HIV-uninfected individuals, MZp possess a strong B-cell regulatory (Breg) potential. As such, MZp B-cells highly express IL-10, the orphan nuclear receptors (NR)4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, the regulatory molecule CD83, as well as ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, all of which are associated with regulation of inflammation. Moreover, the Breg function of MZp B-cells involves CD83 signals. Herein, in order to address the impact of HIV infection and excessive BAFF environment on MZp B-cells and their regulatory capacities, we have performed transcriptomic analyses by RNA-seq of sorted MZp B-cells from the blood of HIV-infected progressors. The Breg profile and function of blood MZp B-cells from HIV-infected progressors were assessed by flow-cytometry and light microscopy high content screening (HCS) analyses, respectively. In addition, the effects of excess BAFF on the Breg profile of MZp B-cells from HIV-uninfected controls were investigated in vitro. We report significant downregulation of NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3 and CD83 gene transcripts in blood MZp B-cells from HIV-infected progressors when compared to HIV-uninfected controls. NR4A1, NR4A3 and CD83 protein expression levels and Breg function were also downregulated in blood MZp B-cells from HIV-infected progressors and not restored by ART. Moreover, we observe decreased expression levels of NR4A1, NR4A3, CD83 and IL-10 by blood and tonsillar MZp B-cells from HIV-uninfected individuals following treatment with excess BAFF, which significantly diminished their regulatory function. These findings suggest that excess BAFF contributes to the alteration of the Breg potential of MZp B-cells, which could lead to a loss of \"immune surveillance\", during HIV infection and possibly in other situations where BAFF is found in excess.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe precursor-like marginal zone (MZp) B-cell population, we previously described in human blood and tonsils, presents with an important regulatory \"Breg\" potential, depicted by elevated nuclear receptor (NR)4As expression levels, similarly to Tregs, and to our knowledge currently underexplored in human Breg studies. Herein, we present the impact that a chronic inflammatory context such as HIV-infection, and its excessive B-cell activating factor (BAFF) environment, may exert on the Breg capacities of MZp, both ex vivo and in vitro, significantly affecting their NR4As expression levels and Breg function. These findings are of growing significance, especially with the recently described importance of MZ B-cell NR4A1 expression in atherosclerosis immune surveillance. The finding that immune surveillance may be altered in circumstances of chronic inflammation and excessive BAFF, is of pivotal interest, as treated HIV-infected individuals often prematurely develop co-morbidities associated with aging such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Moreover, excess BAFF has been reported in several inflammatory autoimmune contexts where CVD is the leading cause of death.",

    "abstract": "Subtelomeres are dynamic genomic regions shaped by elevated rates of recombination, mutation, and gene birth/death. These processes contribute to formation of lineage-specific gene family expansions that commonly occupy subtelomeres across eukaryotes. Investigating the evolution of subtelomeric gene families is complicated by the presence of repetitive DNA and high sequence similarity among gene family members that prevents accurate assembly from whole genome sequences. Here we investigated the evolution of the telomere-associated (TLO) gene family in Candida albicans using 189 complete coding sequences retrieved from 23 genetically diverse strains across the species. TLO genes conformed to the three major structural groups ( /{beta} /{gamma}) previously defined in the genome reference strain but significantly differed in the degree of within-group diversity and positional conservation. One group, TLO{beta}, was always found at the same chromosome arm with strong sequence similarity among all strains. In contrast, diverse Tlo sequences have proliferated among chromosome arms. Tlo{gamma} genes formed seven primary clades that included each of the previously identified Tlo{gamma} genes from the genome reference strain with limited mobility among chromosome arms. Structural groups displayed regions of high conservation that resolved newly identified functional motifs, providing insight into potential regulatory mechanisms that distinguish groups. Thus, by resolving intra-species subtelomeric gene variation, it is possible to identify previously unknown gene family complexity that may underpin adaptive functional variation.",

We generated a high-quality assembly of the chia genome using circular consensus sequencing of PacBio. The assembled six chromosomes are composed of 21 contigs and have a total length of 361.7 Mb. Genome annotation revealed a 53.5% repeat content and 35,850 protein-coding genes. Chia shared a common ancestor with Salvia splendens ~6.1 million years ago. Utilizing the reference genome and two transcriptome datasets, we identified candidate fatty acid desaturases responsible for ALA biosynthesis during chia seed development. Because the seed of S. splendens contains significantly lower proportion of ALA but similar total contents of unsaturated fatty acids, we suggest that strong expression of two ShFAD3 genes are critical for the high ALA content of chia seeds. This genome assembly will serve as a valuable resource for breeding, comparative genomics, and functional genomics studies of chia.",

Electron microscopy later confirmed the doctrine and allowed the identification of synaptic connections. Here we use volume electron microscopy and 3D reconstructions to characterize the nerve net of a cydippid-phase ctenophore, belonging to one of the earliest-branching animal lineages. We found that neurons of its subepithelial nerve net do not follow Cajals neuron doctrine but instead show a continuous plasma membrane forming a syncytium. This is more similar to the reticulate theory of the nervous system put forward by Camillo Golgi. Additionally, we were able to identify new sensory cell types and describe simple neuro-sensory circuits for cydippid-phase ctenophores. Together with the ctenophore-specific synaptic architecture and the presence of an extensive repertoire of lineage-specific neuropeptides our morphological data provide substantial evidence for the independent evolution of the nervous system of ctenophores and the remaining animals.",

Because bacteriophage are often highly specific to bacterial host strains and species, we asked whether bacteriophage present in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) reflect bacterial infections in sepsis. To address this, we generated a workflow for identifying and interpreting bacteriophage sequences in cfDNA and a bacteriophage characteristic dictionary. In two independent cohorts of infected patients and asymptomatic controls, we demonstrate that all individuals, septic and healthy, have a circulating phageome. Moreover, infection associates with overrepresentation of pathogen-specific phage, allowing for the study of bacterial pathogens. We further show that phage can identify pathovariant Escherichia coli infections and distinguish between closely-related pathogenic bacterial species such as Staphylococcus aureus and frequent contaminants such as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Phage DNA may have utility in studying bacteriophage ecology in infection.",
