    "abstract": "Plantar flexor functional deficits measured using joint dynamometry are associated with poor outcomes in patients following Achilles tendon rupture. In this study, we developed a small animal dynamometer to quantify functional deficits in a rat Achilles tendon rupture model. Like our reported plantar flexor deficits in patients recovering from Achilles tendon ruptures, we found in our small animal model functional deficits across the ankle range of motion, resulting in an average 34% less positive work being done compared to the uninjured contralateral limb. These functional deficits are similar to 38% less plantar flexor work done by patients who were treated non-surgically in our prior research. Further, these deficits were greater in plantar flexion than dorsiflexion, which agree with clinical complaints of limited function during tasks like jumping and hiking. These findings highlight the impact of muscle-tendon loading during early tendon healing on long-term plantar flexor function and serve as compelling evidence that our Sprague Dawley rat model of an Achilles tendon rupture recapitulates the human disease. We provide thorough documentation for other groups to build their own dynamometers, which can be modified to meet unique experimental criteria.\n\nSIGNIFIGANCEPreclinical models are critical tools for translating knowledge discovery to clinical decision making. We developed a low-cost and flexible joint dynamometer that quantifies joint function in small animals. Here, we used a rat model to test the implications of Achilles tendon ruptures not surgically repaired on plantar flexor function. We found that Achilles tendon ruptures in a rodent model closely resemble the functional deficits our group has observed in patients.",

    "abstract": "Cancer therapy resistance and recurrence (CTRR) are the dominant causes of death in cancer patients. Recent studies have indicated that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can not only reverse the resistance to cancer therapy but also are crucial biomarkers for the evaluation and prediction of CTRR. Herein, we developed CTRR-ncRNA, a knowledgebase of CTRR-associated ncRNAs, aiming to provide an accurate and comprehensive resource for research involving association between CTRR and ncRNAs. Compared to most of the existing cancer databases, CTRR-ncRNA is focused on the clinical characterization of cancers, including cancer subtypes, as well as survival outcomes and response to personalized therapy of cancer patients. Information pertaining to biomarker ncRNAs has also been documented for the development of personalized CTRR prediction. A user-friendly interface and several functional modules have been incorporated into the database. Based on the preliminary analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships, universal ncRNAs have been found to be potential biomarkers for CTRR. The CTRR-ncRNA is a translation-oriented knowledgebase and it provides a valuable resource for mechanistic investigations and explainable artificial intelligence-based modelling. CTRR-ncRNA is freely available to the public at http://ctrr.bioinf.org.cn/.",

    "abstract": "Gene fusions are important cancer drivers and drug targets, but are difficult to reliably identify with short-read RNA-sequencing. Long-read RNA sequencing data are more likely to span a fusion breakpoint and provide more sequence context around the breakpoint. This allows for more reliable identification of gene fusions and for detecting alternative splicing in gene fusions. Notably, alternative splicing of fusions has been shown to be a mechanism for drug resistance and altered levels of oncogenicity. Here, we present FLAIR-fusion, a computational tool to identify gene fusions and their isoforms from long-read RNA-sequencing data. FLAIR-fusion can detect fusions and their isoforms with high precision and recall, even with error-prone reads. We also investigated different library preparation methods and found that direct-cDNA has a higher incidence of artifactual chimeras than direct-RNA and PCR-cDNA methods. FLAIR-fusion is able to filter these technical artifacts from all of these library prep methods and consistently identify known fusions and their isoforms across cell lines. We ran FLAIR-fusion on amplicon sequencing from multiple tumor samples and cell lines and detected alternative splicing in the previously validated fusion GUCYA2-PIWIL4, which shows that long-read sequencing can detect novel splicing events from cancer gene panels. We also detect fusion isoforms from long-read sequencing in chronic lymphocytic leukemias with the splicing factor mutation SF3B1 K700E, and find that up to 10% of gene fusions had more than one unique isoform. We also compared long-read fusion detection tools with short-read fusion detection tools on the same samples and found greater consensus in the long-read tools. Our results demonstrate that gene fusion isoforms can be effectively detected from long-read RNA-sequencing and are important in the characterization of the full complexity of cancer transcriptomes.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas, which originate from glial cells, are considered the most aggressive type of brain tumors. Currently, glioma research efforts are focused mainly on high-grade gliomas. This project aims to analyze lower-grade gliomas (LGG) in MRI and extend the understanding of LGGs. LGG segmentation, which outlines tumors in MRIs, is crucial to developing effective treatment plans. However, segmentation performed manually by radiologists is tedious, time-consuming, and often leads to inter-observer variability. Another unexplored area of LGG research is genomic subtypes. These subtypes can play a large factor in how LGGs can be treated, however there is currently no noninvasive method of identifying these subtypes. Recent studies suggest that LGG shape features have a correlation with genomic subtypes and should be investigated as a viable factor in LGG treatment options. This presents a need for additional research as most LGGs eventually develop into high-grade gliomas. The specific aims of this project include analyzing LGGs through deep learning-based segmentation, shape feature extraction, and statistical analysis to identify correlation between selected shape features and genomic subtypes. To realize these goals, programs were written and run using a publicly available LGG dataset. In terms of automatic segmentation, two models were created using different convolutional neural networks (CNN). The highest performing model used U-Net with a ResNeXt-50 backbone and yielded a 91.4% accuracy in terms of mean intersection over union (IoU) after testing. Shape feature extraction included three geometric features and 4 radiomic features which quantified tumor shape in 2D and 3D. Angular Standard Deviation (ASD), Margin Fluctuation (MF), Bounding Ellipsoid Volume Ratio (BEVR), Elongation, Major and Minor Axis Length, and Volume were tested for correlation with genomic subtype data using 49 Pearsons chi-squared tests. P-values less than or equal to 0.05 suggested correlation. Statistical analysis found 16 statistically significant associations. The strongest associations were between MF and the RNASeq cluster (p < 0.00003), ASD and the RNASeq Cluster (p < 0.0005), and volume and the RPPA cluster (p < 0.0035).",

    "abstract": "The dimensions and compositions of cells are tightly regulated by active processes. This exquisite control is embodied in the robust scaling laws relating cell size, dry mass, and nuclear size. Despite accumulating experimental evidence, a unified theoretical framework is still lacking. Here, we show that these laws and their breakdown can be explained quantitatively by three simple, yet generic, physical constraints defining altogether the Pump and Leak model (PLM). Based on estimations, we clearly map the PLM coarse-grained parameters with the dominant cellular events they stem from. We propose that dry mass density homeostasis arises from the scaling between proteins and small osmolytes, mainly amino-acids and ions. Our theory predicts this scaling to naturally fail, both at senescence when DNA and RNAs are saturated by RNA polymerases and ribosomes respectively, and at mitotic entry due to the counterion release following histone tail modifications. We further show that nuclear scaling result from osmotic balance at the nuclear envelope (NE) and a large pool of metabolites, which dilutes chromatin counterions that do not scale during growth.",

    "abstract": "Bone destruction is a hallmark of chronic inflammation, and bone-resorbing osteoclasts arising under such a condition differ from steady-state ones. However, osteoclast diversity remains poorly explored. Here, we combined transcriptomic profiling, differentiation assays and in vivo analysis in mouse to decipher specific traits for inflammatory and steady state osteoclasts. We identified and validated the pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) TLR2, Dectin-1 and Mincle, all involved in yeast recognition as major regulators of inflammatory osteoclasts. We showed that administration of the yeast probiotic Saccharomyces boulardi CNCM I-745 (Sb) in vivo reduced bone loss in OVX but not sham mice by reducing inflammatory osteoclasts. This beneficial impact of Sb is mediated by the regulation of the inflammatory environment required for the generation of inflammatory osteoclasts. We also showed that Sb derivatives as well as agonists of TLR2, Dectin-1 and Mincle specifically inhibited directly the differentiation of inflammatory but not steady state osteoclasts in vitro. These findings demonstrate a preferential use of the PRR-associated costimulatory differentiation pathway by inflammatory osteoclasts, thus enabling their specific inhibition, which opens new therapeutic perspectives for inflammatory bone loss.",

    "abstract": "PCSK9 negatively regulates low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) abundance on the cell surface, leading to decreased hepatic clearance of LDL particles and increased levels of plasma cholesterol. We previously identified SURF4 as a cargo receptor that facilitates PCSK9 secretion in HEK293T cells (Emmer et al., 2018). Here, we generated hepatic SURF4-deficient mice (Surf4fl/fl Alb-Cre+) to investigate the physiologic role of SURF4 in vivo. Surf4fl/fl Alb-Cre+ mice exhibited normal viability, gross development, and fertility. Plasma PCSK9 levels were reduced by {bsim}60% in Surf4fl/fl Alb-Cre+ mice, with a corresponding {bsim}50% increase in steady state LDLR protein abundance in the liver, consistent with SURF4 functioning as a cargo receptor for PCSK9. Surprisingly, these mice exhibited a marked reduction in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels out of proportion to the partial increase in hepatic LDLR abundance. Detailed characterization of lipoprotein metabolism in these mice instead revealed a severe defect in hepatic lipoprotein secretion, consistent with prior reports of SURF4 also promoting the secretion of apolipoprotein B. Despite a small increase in liver mass and lipid content, histologic evaluation revealed no evidence of steatohepatitis or fibrosis in Surf4fl/fl Alb-Cre+ mice. Acute depletion of hepatic SURF4 by CRISPR/Cas9 or liver-targeted siRNA in adult mice confirms these findings. Together, these data support the physiologic significance of SURF4 in the hepatic secretion of PCSK9 and APOB-containing lipoproteins and its potential as a therapeutic target in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.",

However, little is known about how adolescent alcohol consumption influences the maturation and trajectory of cortical circuit development. Here, we explore the consequences of adolescent binge drinking on somatostatin (SST) neuronal function in superficial layers of the prelimbic (PL) cortex in male and female SST-Ai9 mice. We find that adolescent drinking-in-the-dark (DID) produces sex-dependent increases in intrinsic excitability of SST neurons, with no change in overall SST cell number, persisting well into adulthood. While we did not find evidence of altered GABA release from SST neurons onto other neurons within the circuit, we found a complementary reduction in layer II/III pyramidal neuron excitability immediately after binge drinking; however, this hypoexcitability rebounded towards increased pyramidal neuron activity in adulthood in females, suggesting long-term homeostatic adaptations in this circuit. Together, this suggests that binge drinking during key developmental timepoints leads to permanent changes in PL microcircuitry function, which may have broad behavioral implications.",

    "abstract": "Morphology is a defining feature of neuronal identity. Like neurons, glia display diverse morphologies, both across and within glial classes, but are also known to be morphologically plastic. Here, we explored the relationship between glial morphology and transcriptional signature using the Drosophila central nervous system, where glia are categorized into five main classes (outer and inner surface glia, cortex glia, ensheathing glia, and astrocytes), which show within-class morphological diversity. We analysed and validated single cell RNA sequencing data of Drosophila glia in two well-characterized tissues from distinct developmental stages, containing distinct circuit types: the embryonic ventral nerve cord (motor) and the adult optic lobes (sensory). Our analysis identified a new morphologically and transcriptionally distinct surface glial population in the ventral nerve cord. However, many glial morphological categories could not be distinguished transcriptionally, and indeed, embryonic and adult astrocytes were transcriptionally analogous despite differences in developmental stage and circuit type. While we did detect extensive within-class transcriptomic diversity for optic lobe glia, this could be explained entirely by glial residence in the most superficial neuropil (lamina) and an associated enrichment for immune-related gene expression. In summary, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of glia in Drosophila, and our extensive in vivo validation revealed that glia exhibit more diversity at the morphological level than was detectable at the transcriptional level. This atlas will serve as a resource for the community to probe glial diversity and function.",

In an Amazonian landscape composed by savanna and forest, we investigated the effects of different fire regimes in a 12-ha area in three periods through 23 years. We also examined the effects of frequency and extent of fires, tree cover, and distance to forest on bird composition in twelve 3.7- ha savanna plots. Birds were surveyed with mist-nets and species were classified as to their habitat use by comparison of registers in forest and savanna plots through visual/acoustical surveys. After 13 years without fire, many forest species colonized the area and some savanna species were lost. Fire regime affected avifauna assemblages. The avifauna was sensitive to the occurrence of fires. After one fire event in a plot that had not burned for 12 years, some savanna species returned. These results highlight the effects of the fire regime on birds and indicate that many savanna bird species depend on the occurrence of regular fires.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeats (STRs), genomic regions each consisting of a sequence of 1-6 base pairs repeated in succession, represent one of the largest sources of human genetic variation. However, many STR effects are not captured well by standard genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or downstream analyses that are mostly based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To study the involvement of STRs in complex traits, we imputed genotypes for 445,735 autosomal STRs into SNP data from 408,153 White British UK Biobank participants and tested for association with 44 blood and serum biomarker phenotypes. We used two fine-mapping methods, SuSiE and FINEMAP, to identify 118 high-confidence STR-trait associations predicted as causal variants under all fine-mapping settings tested. Using these results, we estimate that STRs drive 5.2-9.7% of GWAS signals for these traits. Our high confidence STR-trait associations implicate STRs in some of the strongest hits for multiple phenotypes, including a trinucleotide STR in APOB associated with LDL cholesterol and a CGG repeat in the promoter of CBL associated with multiple platelet traits. Replication analyses in additional population groups and orthogonal expression data further support the role of a subset of the candidate STRs we identify. Together, our study suggests that polymorphic tandem repeats make widespread contributions to complex traits, provides a set of stringently selected candidate causal STRs, and demonstrates the need to routinely consider a more complete view of human genetic variation in GWAS.",

The relationship matrix included 866 individuals: a) founder SPs sampled from the wild; b) progeny GPs from founders; c) Farm-tested SPs crossed from b); and d) progeny GPs from farm-tested SPs. The complete pedigree-based relationship matrix was estimated for all individuals. A subset of founder SPs (n = 58) and GPs (n = 276) were genotyped with Diversity Array Technology and whole genome sequencing, respectively. We evaluated GS prediction accuracy via cross validation on farm-tested SPs in two years using a basic GBLUP model. We also estimated the general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) variances of parental GPs. A total of 11 yield-related and morphology traits were evaluated. The cross validation accuracies for dry weight per meter (r ranged from 0.16 to 0.35) and wet weight per meter (r ranged 0.19 to 0.35) were comparable to GS accuracy for yield traits in terrestrial crops. For morphology traits, cross validation accuracy exceeded 0.18 in all scenarios except for blade thickness in the second year. Accuracy in a third validation year for dry weight per meter over a confirmation set of 87 individuals was 0.31.",

    "abstract": "The population of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) is largely derived from settlers who migrated primarily from England and Ireland in the 1700-1800s. Previously described as an isolated founder population, based on historical and demographic studies, data on the genetic ancestry of this population remains fragmentary. Here we describe the largest investigation of patrilineal ancestry in NL. To determine the paternal genetic structure of the population, 1,110 Y chromosomes from an NL based cohort were analyzed using 5,761 Y-specific markers. We identified 160 distinct paternal haplotypes, the majority of which (71.4%) belong to the R1b haplogroup. When NL is compared with global reference populations, the haplotype composition and frequencies of the NL paternal lineages primarily resemble the English and Irish ancestral source populations. There is also evidence for genetic contributions from Basque, French, Portuguese, and Spanish fishermen and early settlers that frequented NL. The population structure shows geographical and religious clustering that can be associated with the settlement of ancestral source populations from England and Ireland. For example, the R1b-M222 haplotype, seen in people of Irish descent, is found clustered in the Irish-settled Southeast region of NL. The clustering and expansion of Y haplotypes in conjunction with the geographical and religious clusters illustrate that limited subsequent in-migration, geographic isolation and societal factors have contributed to the genetic substructure of the NL population and its designation as a founder population.",

    "abstract": "Comparative analysis of whole-genome sequences can provide valuable insights into the evolutionary patterns of diversification and adaptation of species, including the genome contents and the regions under selection. However, such studies are lacking for fishes in New Zealand. To supplement the recently sequenced genome of tarakihi (Nemadactylus macropterus), the genomes of five additional percomorph species native to New Zealand (king tarakihi (Nemadactylus n.sp.), blue moki (Latridopsis ciliaris), butterfish (Odax pullus), barracouta (Thyrsites atun), and kahawai (Arripis trutta)) were determined and assembled using Illumina sequencing. While the proportion of repeat elements was highly correlated with the genome size (R2 = 0.97, P < 0.01), most of the metrics for the genic features (e.g. number of exons or intron length) were significantly correlated with assembly contiguity (| R2| = 0.79-0.97). A phylogenomic tree including eight additional high-quality fish genomes was reconstructed from sequences of shared gene families. The radiation of Percomorpha was estimated to have occurred c. 112 mya (mid-Cretaceous), while the Latridae have diverged from true Perciformes c. 83 mya (late Cretaceous). Evidence of positive selection was found in 65 genes in tarakihi and 209 genes in Latridae: the largest portion of these are involved in the ATP binding pathway and the integral structure of membranes. These results and the de novo genome sequences can be used to (1) inform future studies on both the strength and shortcomings of scaffold-level assemblies for comparative genomics and (2) provide insights into the evolutionary patterns and processes of genome evolution in bony fishes.",

To address the declining of coral reefs, artificial reefs have been introduced to encapsulate the aglae cells in a polymer matrix but the effects of nanoscale pollutants on these engineered systems have not been fully understood. In this work, quantum dots with a size smaller than 10 nm are being used to elucidate the photosynthesis performance of the sodium alginate beads encapsulated with Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris). The fluorescent quantum dots can move into the alginate matrix and the fluorescence intensity in the algae beads is correlated with the quantum dot concentration. We further show that the photosynthesis of the algae beads are sensitive to the quantum dot concentration and are also time sensitive. In the first 48 min of quantum dot exposure, both carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen production are low, suggesting limited photosynthesis. After the initial incubation, the photosynthesis rate quickly increases even though more inhibition is still observed with higher concentration of the quantum dots.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers identification is difficult for cancer and other polygenic traits because such complicated diseases occur due to an intricate interplay of various genetic materials. Although high-throughput data from recent technolo-gies provide access to a tremendous amount of information still there is a huge gap in harnessing knowledge from the generated multi-omics data. It is evident from the availability of subject-specific multi-omics data from large consortiums that there is a growing need for appropriate tools to analyze such data. Traditional single-omics association tests more often identify strong signals but fail to explore the between-omics relationship and find moderately weak signals due to multiple testing burdens. Multi-omics data integration intuitively provides a clear advantage in understanding the genetic architecture of disease a little better by imparting complementary information. But the construction of such methods is challenging because of the diversity in the nature of multiple omics and the sample size which is much less than the number of omics variables. It is important to consider factors such as data diversity and prior biological knowledge to make meaningful and better predictions. Dimension reduction techniques such as feature selection are used to circumvent the sample size issue in general but treating all the omics variables similarly might be an oversimplification of the complex biological interactions. The lack of appropriate approaches for biomarker identification from complex multi-omics data led us to develop this method. ioSearch is a tool for integrating two omics assays with continuous measurements. Based on a two-step model, ioSearch explores the inter-relationship of the omics in a principal regression framework and selects features using sparse principal component analysis to provide easily interpretable inference in terms of p-values. Also, it uses prior biological information to reduce multiple testing burdens. Extensive simulation results show that our method is statistically powerful with a controlled type I error rate. Application of ioSearch to two publicly available breast cancer datasets identified relevant genes and proteins in important pathways.",

However, the most widely used clustering algorithms are heuristic and do not formally account for statistical uncertainty. Many popular pipelines use clustering stability methods to assess the algorithms output and decide on the number of clusters. However, we find that by not addressing known sources of variability in a statistically rigorous manner, these analyses lead to overconfidence in the discovery of novel cell-types. We extend a previous method for Gaussian data, Significance of Hierarchical Clustering (SHC), to propose a model-based hypothesis testing approach that incorporates significance analysis into the clustering algorithm and permits statistical evaluation of clusters as distinct cell populations. We also adapt this approach to permit statistical assessment on the clusters reported by any algorithm. We benchmarked our approach on real-world datasets against popular clustering workflows, demonstrating improved performance. To show its practical utility, we applied it to the Human Lung Cell Atlas and an atlas of the mouse cerebellar cortex. We identified several cases of over-clustering, leading to false discoveries, as well as under-clustering, resulting in the failure to identify new subpopulations that our method was able to detect.",

    "abstract": "Aphanomyces root rot (ARR) is a devastating disease in field pea (Pisum sativum L.) that can cause up to 100% crop failure. Assessment of ARR resistance can be a rigorous, costly, time-demanding activity that is relatively low-throughput and prone to human errors. These limits the ability to effectively and efficiently phenotype the disease symptoms arising from ARR infection, which remains a perennial bottleneck to the successful evaluation and incorporation of disease resistance into new cultivars. In this study, we developed a greenhouse-based high throughput phenotyping (HTP) platform that moves along the rails above the greenhouse benches and captures the visual symptoms caused by Aphanomyces euteiches in field pea. We pilot tested this platform alongside with conventional visual scoring in five experimental trials under greenhouse conditions, assaying over 12,600 single plants. Precision estimated through broad-sense heritability (H2) was consistently higher for the HTP-indices (H2 Exg =0.86) than the traditional visual scores (H2 DSI=0.59), potentially increasing the power of genetic mapping. We genetically dissected variation for ARR resistance using the HTP-indices, and identified a total of 260 associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through genome-wide association (GWA) mapping. The number of associated SNP for HTP-indices was consistently higher with some SNP overlapped to the associated SNP identified using the visual scores. We identified numerous small-effect QTLs, with the most significant SNP explaining about 5 to 9% of the phenotypic variance per index, and identified previously mapped genes known to be involved in the biological pathways that trigger immunity against ARR, including Psat5g280480, Psat5g282800, Psat5g282880, and Psat2g167800. We also identified a few novel QTLs with small-effect sizes that may be worthy of validation in the future. The newly identified QTLs and underlying genes, along with genotypes with promising resistance identified in this study, can be useful for improving a long-term, durable resistance to ARR.",

Each OR is activated by specific odorous ligands. Like other GPCRs, activation of ORs may be blocked through antagonism. Recent reports highlight widespread antagonisms in odor mixtures influencing olfactory neuron activities. However, it is unclear if and how these antagonisms influence perception of odor mixtures. Here we show that odorant antagonisms at the receptor level alter odor perception. Using a large-scale heterologous expression, we first identified a set of human ORs that are activated by methanethiol and hydrogen sulfide, two extremely potent volatile sulfur malodors. We then screened odorants that block activation of these ORs and identified a set of antagonists, including {beta}-ionone. Finally, human sensory evaluation revealed that odor intensity and unpleasantness of methanethiol were decreased by {beta}-ionone. Odor intensity of {beta}-ionone itself is not correlated with the degree of suppression of malodor sensation. Suppression was also not observed when methanethiol and {beta}-ionone were simultaneously introduced to different nostrils. Together, our data supports the model that odor sensation is altered through antagonistic interactions at the level of the ORs.",

    "abstract": "Neurons perform input-output operations that integrate synaptic inputs with intrinsic electrical properties, operations generally constrained by the brevity of synaptic events. Here we report that sustained firing of CA1 hippocampal fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) can be persistently interrupted for up to several hundred milliseconds following brief GABAAR-mediated inhibition in vitro and in vivo. A single presynaptic neuron could interrupt PV-INs firing, occasionally with a single action potential (AP), and reliably with AP bursts. Experiments and computational modeling revealed that the persistent interruption of firing maintains neurons in a depolarized, quiescent state through a cell-autonomous mechanism. Strikingly, interrupted PV-INs are highly responsive to Schaffer collateral inputs. The persistent interruption of firing provides a disinhibitory circuit mechanism favoring spike generation in CA1 pyramidal cells. Overall, our results demonstrate that neuronal silencing can far outlast brief synaptic inhibition owing to well-tuned interplay between neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic membrane dynamics, a phenomenon impacting microcircuit function.",

    "abstract": "The inability of mature retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to regenerate axons after optic nerve injury can be partially reversed by manipulating cell-autonomous and/or -non-autonomous factors, among which are neuroimmune interactions. We report here that preconditioning resulting from a mild lens injury (conditioning LI, cLI) prior to optic nerve damage induces far greater axon regeneration than LI or the pro-inflammatory agent zymosan after nerve injury or preconditioning with Zymosan. Unlike other instances of immune-supported regeneration, cLI is unaltered by depleting mature neutrophils, T cells or blocking receptors for identified inflammation-associated growth factors (Oncomodulin, SDF1, CCL5), and is only partially diminished by suppressing peripheral monocyte recruitment. Repeated LI leads to full-length optic nerve regeneration, and pharmacological removal of local resident macrophages with the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor PLX5622 enables some axons to re-innervate the brain in just 6 weeks. Thus, cell non-autonomous interventions not involving genetic manipulations can induce high levels of optic nerve regeneration, paving the way to uncover potent, translatable therapeutic targets for CNS repair.",

    "abstract": "Combining data collected from multiple study sites is becoming common and is advantageous to researchers to increase the generalizability and replicability of scientific discoveries. However, at the same time, unwanted inter-scanner biases are commonly observed across neuroimaging data collected from multiple study sites or scanners, rendering difficulties in integrating such data to obtain reliable findings. While several methods for handling such unwanted variations have been proposed, most of them use univariate approaches that could be too simple to capture all sources of scanner-specific variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multivariate harmonization method, called RELIEF (REmoval of Latent Inter-scanner Effects through Factorization) for estimating and removing both explicit and latent scanner effects. Our method is the first approach to introduce the simultaneous dimension reduction and factorization of interlinked matrices to a data harmonization context, which provides a new direction in methodological research for correcting inter-scanner biases. Analyzing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from the Social Processes Initiative in Neurobiology of the Schizophrenia (SPINS) study and conducting extensive simulation studies, we show that RELIEF outperforms existing harmonization methods in mitigating inter-scanner biases and retaining biological associations of interest to increase statistical power. RELIEF is publicly available as an R package.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injuries, for which there are limited effective clinical treatments, result in enduring paralysis and hypoesthesia due, in part, to the inhibitory microenvironment that develops and limits regeneration/sprouting, especially during chronic stages. Recently, we discovered that targeted enzymatic modulation of the potently inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) component of the extracellular and perineuronal net (PNN) matrix via Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) can rapidly restore robust respiratory function to the previously paralyzed hemi-diaphragm after remarkably long times post-injury (up to 1.5 years) following a cervical level 2 lateral hemi-transection. Importantly, ChABC treatment at cervical level 4 in this chronic model also elicited rapid, albeit modest, improvements in upper arm function. In the present study, we sought to further optimize and elucidate the capacity for nerve sprouting and/or regeneration to restore gross as well as fine motor control of the forearm and digits at lengthy chronic stages post injury. However, instead of using ChABC, we utilized a novel and more clinically relevant systemic, non-invasive combinatorial treatment strategy designed to both reduce and overcome inhibitory CSPGs simultaneously and spatially extensively. Following a three-month upper cervical spinal hemi-lesion using adult female Sprague Dawley rats, we show that the combined treatment has a profound effect on functional recovery of the chronically paralyzed forelimb and paw, specifically during walking as well as precision movements of the digits. Our exciting pre-clinical findings will begin to enhance our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying functionally beneficial regenerative events occurring at chronic injury stages for clinically relevant translational benefits.\n\nSignificance statementOvercoming the persistent axon inhibitory environment following a functionally debilitating incomplete spinal cord lesion has long proven to be an elusive dilemma, especially months to years after the initial spinal injury. Current therapeutic and rehabilitative techniques for patients suffering from chronic cervical spinal insults minimally, if at all, address this structural hindrance and support limited return of crucial behaviors such as voluntary use of the arms and hands. Our investigation into the behavioral and anatomical consequences of systemically perturbing the high-affinity binding interaction between the receptor PTP{sigma} and the extracellular chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans highlight an underlying barrier to the restoration of forelimb/paw walking and eating behavior 12-weeks after a cervical spinal hemi-transection.",

    "abstract": "Within the spinal cord, interneurons shape motor neuron activity. These interneurons can project over long distances in the longitudinal axis, but systematic mapping of their connectivity has been limited. In this study, using larval zebrafish, we mapped local and long-range connectivity of a cardinal spinal population, the Gata3+ V2b class. V2b neurons are inhibitory and project ipsilateral, descending axons. We show that V2b neurons are active during fictive swimming, slightly leading the motor burst. Via optogenetic mapping of output in the rostrocaudal axis, we demonstrate that V2b neurons robustly inhibit motor neurons and other major spinal interneuron classes, including V2a, V1, commissural neurons and other V2b neurons. V2b inhibition is patterned along the rostrocaudal axis, providing long-range inhibition to motor and V2a neurons but more localized innervation of the V1 class. Furthermore, these results provide the first demonstration of reciprocal V1/V2b inhibition in axial circuits, potentially representing an ancestral motif of the limb control network.",

    "abstract": "Neural network flexibility extends to changes in neuronal participation between networks. This neuronal switching can include neurons moving between single- and dual-network activity. We previously identified an example in which bursting at a second frequency occurs due to modulation of intrinsic membrane properties instead of synaptic recruitment into a second network. However, the intrinsic properties that are modulated were not determined. Here, we use small networks in the Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) to examine modulation of intrinsic properties underlying neuropeptide- (Gly1-SIFamide) elicited neuronal switching. The LPG neuron switches from exclusive participation in the fast pyloric ([~]1 Hz) network, due to electrical coupling, to dual-network activity which includes periodic escapes from the fast rhythm via intrinsically-generated oscillations at the slower gastric mill network frequency ([~]0.1 Hz). We isolated LPG from both networks using pharmacology and hyperpolarizing current injection. Gly1-SIFamide increased LPG intrinsic excitability and rebound from inhibition, and decreased spike frequency adaptation, which can all contribute to intrinsic bursting. Using ion substitution and channel blockers, we found that a hyperpolarization-activated current, a persistent sodium current, and a calcium or calcium-related current(s) appear to be primary contributors to Gly1-SIFamide-elicited LPG intrinsic bursting. However, this intrinsic bursting was more sensitive to blocking currents when LPG received rhythmic electrical coupling input from the fast network than in the isolated condition. Overall, a switch from single- to dual-network activity can involve modulation of multiple intrinsic properties, while synaptic input from a second network can shape the contributions of these properties.\n\nNew and NoteworthyNeuropeptide-elicited intrinsic bursting was recently determined to switch a neuron from single to dual-network participation. Here we identified multiple intrinsic properties modulated in the dual-network state and candidate ion channels underlying the intrinsic bursting. Bursting at the second network frequency was more sensitive to blocking currents in the dual-network state than when neurons were synaptically isolated from their home network. Thus, synaptic input can shape the contributions of modulated intrinsic properties underlying dual-network activity.",

    "abstract": "Pregnenolone (P5) is a neurosteroid produced in the brain. It improves cognitive function and protects against cannabis intoxication as well as spinal cord injury. P5 activates CLIP1, which helps microtubule polymerization at its growing end; however, the significance of P5 activation of CLIP1 in the brain is still unknown. Here we examined the roles of P5 in cultured neurons and in zebrafish cerebellum. We show that P5 promotes neurite outgrowth and facilitates axon development of cultured cerebellar granule neurons. P5 also changes the morphology of axon growth cone and promotes dynamic microtubule invasion into the distal part of filopodia at the growth cone. We have used CRISPR to disrupt clip1a in zebrafish, disrupting the ability of P5 to change microtubule dynamics and growth cone morphology, as well as to reorganize cytoskeleton. In vivo, P5 accelerated cerebellum development in WT but not clip1a mutant zebrafish, and expression of exogenous CLIP1 in clip1a mutant promoted cerebellum development in response to P5. Thus, we have delineated the pathway by which P5 promotes cerebellum development by activating CLIP1 to promote microtubule dynamics leading to increased microtubule penetration into the growth cone and accelerated neurite outgrowth. This study reveals the mechanism by which P5 and CLIP1 function to promote neural development.\n\nSignificance Statement1. We have elucidated the mechanism of pregnenolone (P5) actionP5 enhances brain functions, but its mode of action was unclear. Here we show that P5 activates CLIP1 to promote microtubule dynamics at the growth cone and to accelerate neural development.\n\n2. We have generated a zebrafish model of CLIP1 deficiencyCLIP1 deficiency causes intellectual disability and defective neural development. Our zebrafish model can be used to study mechanisms related to this disease and other microtubule defects.\n\n3.

Here, we systematically assess medium components, coatings, and growth factors required for iPSC differentiation to microglia. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, qPCR, and functional assays, with validation across two labs, we have identified several medium components from previous protocols that are redundant and do not contribute to microglial identity.

Present study investigated possible role of immunosuppressive indolamine-2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme in the alteration of neutrophil (NEUT) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) functionality of crossbred cows. Blood was collected from non-pregnant (NP) and pregnant (P) cows, followed by isolation of NEUT and PBMCs. Plasma pro-inflammatory (IFN{gamma} and TNF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were estimated by ELISA and analysis of IDO1 gene in NEUT and PBMCs by RT-qPCR. Neutrophil functionality was assessed by chemotaxis, measuring activity of myeloperoxidase and {beta}-D glucuronidase enzyme and evaluating nitric oxide production. Changes in PBMCs functionality was determined by transcriptional expression of pro-inflammatory (IFN{gamma}, TNF) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4, IL-10, TGF{beta}1) genes. Significantly elevated (P < 0.05) anti-inflammatory cytokines, increased IDO1 expression, reduced NEUT velocity, MPO activity and NO production observed only in P cows. Significantly higher (P < 0.05) expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and TNF genes were observed in PBMCs.

Among the three Drosophila robo family genes (robo1, robo2, and robo3), robo2 displays a dynamic expression pattern and regulates multiple axon guidance outcomes, including preventing midline crossing in some axons, promoting midline crossing in others, forming lateral longitudinal axon pathways, and regulating motor axon guidance. The identity and location of enhancer elements regulating robo2s complex and dynamic expression pattern in different neural cell types are unknown. Here, we characterize a set of 17 transgenic lines expressing GAL4 under the control of DNA sequences derived from noncoding regions in and around robo2, to identify enhancers controlling specific aspects of robo2 expression in the embryonic ventral nerve cord. We identify individual fragments that confer expression in specific cell types where robo2 is known to function, including early pioneer neurons, midline glia, and lateral longitudinal neurons. Our results indicate that robo2s dynamic expression pattern is specified by a combination of enhancer elements that are active in different subsets of cells. We show that robo2s expression in lateral longitudinal axons represents two genetically separable subsets of neurons, and compare their axon projections with each other and with Fasciclin II (FasII), a commonly used marker of longitudinal axon pathways. In addition, we provide a general description of each fragments expression in embryonic tissues outside of the nervous system, to serve as a resource for other researchers who may be interested in robo2 expression and its functional roles outside the CNS.",

    "abstract": "Components of immune systems face significant selective pressure to efficiently use organismal resources, mitigate infection, and resist parasitic manipulation. A theoretically optimal immune defense balances investment in constitutive and inducible immune components depending on the kinds of parasites encountered, but genetic and dynamic constraints can force deviation away from theoretical optima. One such potential constraint is pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene affects multiple phenotypes. Although pleiotropy can prevent or dramatically slow adaptive evolution, it is prevalent in the signaling networks that compose metazoan immune systems. We hypothesized that pleiotropy is maintained in immune signaling networks despite slowed adaptive evolution because it provides some other advantage, such as forcing network evolution to compensate in ways that increase host fitness during infection. To study the effects of pleiotropy on the evolution of immune signaling networks, we used an agent-based modeling approach to evolve a population of host immune systems infected by simultaneously co-evolving parasites. Four kinds of pleiotropic restrictions on evolvability were incorporated into the networks, and their evolutionary outcomes were compared to, and competed against, non-pleiotropic networks. As the networks evolved, we tracked several metrics of immune network complexity, relative investment in inducible and constitutive defenses, and features associated with the winners and losers of competitive simulations. Our results suggest non-pleiotropic networks evolve to deploy highly constitutive immune responses regardless of parasite prevalence, but some implementations of pleiotropy favor the evolution of highly inducible immunity. These inducible pleiotropic networks are no less fit than non-pleiotropic networks and can out-compete non-pleiotropic networks in competitive simulations. These provide a theoretical explanation for the prevalence of pleiotropic genes in immune systems and highlight a mechanism that could facilitate the evolution of inducible immune responses.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenes involved in immune defense are hotspots of adaptive evolution as they resist rapidly evolving parasites and pathogens. Pleiotropic genes, which affect multiple discrete traits, have been shown to evolve at a much slower rate than non-pleiotropic genes but are highly represented in the immune system. The evolutionary effects of pleiotropic signaling genes on immune evolution are poorly understood, so we developed a model of pleiotropic signaling network evolution to address this gap in knowledge. Our results show that pleiotropy may be an important genomic feature in the development of inducible immunity.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora infestans populations and lineages vary widely in host specificity from specialisation to generalism among potato and tomato. However, generalists that displace others and became dominant on both hosts are relatively uncommon. Generalists may have lower fitness compared to specialists on the host of the latter, which could explain their coexistence at many locations. Lesion size is an aggressiveness metric closely related to fitness in P. infestans. A trade-off between generalism and lesion growth rate on the original host can explain the variation among blight populations. I collated the data from cross-inoculation trials on potato and tomato isolates to test for the trade-off. In addition, other metrics related to disease symptoms were included to test whether the degree of specificity is different between populations from potato and tomato, and to explore whether specificity had changed over time. The results indicate a trade-off between generalism and lesion growth rate where higher specificity was associated with significantly faster lesion growth on the original host at the population-level, but not at the lineage-level. Potato and tomato isolates were overall not significantly different in specificity, but tomato isolates tended towards generalism with time. These findings indicate that specialists may avoid displacement on their host by generalists through faster lesion growth, and help explain the common co-occurrence of generalists and specialists. However, a few invasive generalists can rapidly displace competitors and became dominant on both hosts across a broader region. It is likely that important exceptions exist to this trade-off.",

We used a case-control study of Kenyan children and in vitro adhesion assays to test the hypothesis that \"double dose\" non-O genotypes (AA, BB, AB) are associated with increased risk of severe malaria and larger rosettes than \"single dose\" heterozygotes (AO, BO). In the case-control study, compared to OO, the double dose genotypes consistently had higher odds ratios (OR) for severe malaria than single dose genotypes, with AB (OR 1.93) and AO (OR 1.27) showing most marked difference (P=0.02, Wald test). In vitro experiments with blood group A-preferring P. falciparum parasites showed that significantly larger rosettes were formed with AA and AB host RBCs compared to OO, whereas AO genotype rosettes were indistinguishable from OO. Overall, the data show that ABO genotype influences P. falciparum rosetting and support the hypothesis that double dose non-O genotypes confer a greater risk of severe malaria than AO/BO heterozygosity.",

    "abstract": "Plant viruses account for enormous agricultural losses worldwide, and the most effective way to combat them is to identify genetic material conferring plant resistance to these pathogens. Aiming to identify genetic associations with responses to infection, we screened a large panel of Arabidopsis thaliana natural inbred lines for four disease-related traits caused by infection by A. thaliana-naive and -adapted isolates of the natural pathogen turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). We detected a strong, replicable association in a 1.5 Mb region on chromosome 2 with a 10-fold increase in relative risk of systemic necrosis. The region contains several plausible causal genes as well as abundant structural variation, including an insertion of a Copia transposon into a Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR-NBS-LRR) coding for a gene involved in defense, that could be either a driver or a consequence of the disease-resistance locus. When inoculated with TuMV, loss-of-function mutant plants of this gene exhibited different symptoms than wild-type plants, being the magnitude and sign of the difference dependent on the degree of adaptation of the viral isolate to A. thaliana. This increase in symptoms severity was specific for infections with the adapted isolate. Necrosis-associated alleles are found worldwide, and their distribution is consistent with a trade-off between resistance during viral outbreaks and a cost of resistance otherwise, leading to negative frequency-dependent selection.",

    "abstract": "Weevils are a diverse insect group that includes many economically important invasive pest species. Despite their importance and diversity, only nine weevil genomes have been sequenced, representing a tiny fraction of this heterogeneous taxon. The genus Sitona consists of over 100 species, including Sitona discoideus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae), commonly known as lucerne (or alfalfa root) weevil. Sitona discoideus is an important pest of forage crops, particularly Medicago species. Using a dual sequencing approach with Oxford Nanopore MinION long-reads and 10x Genomics linked-read sequencing, we generated a high-quality hybrid genome assembly of S. discoideus. Benchmarks derived from evolutionarily informed expectations of gene content for near-universal single-copy orthologs comparison (BUSCO) scores are above 96% for single-copy orthologs derived from eukaryotes, arthropods, and insects. With a de novo repeat library, Repeatmasker annotated 81.45% of the genome as various repeat elements, of which 22.1% were unclassified. Using the MAKER2 pipeline, we annotated 10,008 protein-coding genes and 13,611 mRNAs. Furthermore, 68.84% of total predicted mRNAs and 67.90% of predicted proteins were functionally annotated to one or more of InterPro, gene ontology, and Pfam databases. This high-quality genome assembly and annotation will enable the development of critical novel genetic pest control technologies and act as an essential reference genome for broader population genetics and weevil comparative genetic studies.",

However, current dPCR systems often require DNA templates to share partitions due to limited partitioning capacities. Here, we introduce Ultra-dPCR, a next generation dPCR system where DNA counting is performed in a single-molecule regimen through a 6-log dynamic range using a swift and parallelized workflow. Each Ultra-dPCR reaction is divided into >30 million partitions without microfluidics to achieve single template occupancy. Combined with a unique emulsion chemistry, partitions are optically clear and enable the use of a 3D imaging technique to rapidly detect DNA-positive partitions. Single molecule occupancy also allows for more straightforward multiplex assay development due to the absence of partition-specific competition. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a 222-plex Ultra-dPCR assay and demonstrated its potential use as a rapid, low-cost screening assay for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for as low as 4% trisomy fraction samples with high precision, accuracy, and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "While excipients are often overlooked as the \"inactive\" ingredients in pharmaceutical formulations, they often play a critical role in protein stability and absorption kinetics. Recent work has identified an ultrafast absorbing insulin formulation that is the result of excipient modifications. Specifically, the insulin monomer can be isolated by replacing zinc and the phenolic preservative metacresol with phenoxyethanol as an antimicrobial agent and an amphiphilic acrylamide copolymer excipient for stability. A greater understanding is needed of the interplay between excipients, insulin association state, and stability in order to optimize this formulation. Here, we formulated insulin with different preservatives and stabilizing excipient concentrations using both insulin lispro and regular human insulin and assessed the insulin association states using analytical ultracentrifugation as well as formulation stability. We determined that phenoxyethanol is required to eliminate hexamers and promote a high monomer content even in a zinc-free lispro formulation. There is also a concentration dependent relationship between the concentration of polyacrylamide-based copolymer excipient and insulin stability, where a concentration greater than 0.1 g/mL copolymer is required for a mostly monomeric zinc-free lispro formulation to achieve stability exceeding that of Humalog in a stressed aging assay. Further, we determined that under the formulation conditions tested zinc-free regular human insulin remains primarily hexameric and is not at this time a promising candidate for rapid-acting formulations.",

    "abstract": "Optimal control simulations of musculoskeletal models can be used to reconstruct motions measured with optical motion capture to estimate joint and muscle kinematics and kinetics. These simulations are mutually and dynamically consistent, in contrast to traditional inverse methods. Commonly, optimal control simulations are generated by tracking generalized coordinates in combination with ground reaction forces. The generalized coordinates are estimated from marker positions using, for example, inverse kinematics. Hence, inaccuracies in the estimated coordinates are tracked in the simulation. We developed an approach to reconstruct arbitrary motions, such as change of direction motions, using optimal control simulations of 3D full-body musculoskeletal models by directly tracking marker and ground reaction force data. For evaluation, we recorded three trials each of straight running, curved running, and a v-cut for 10 participants. We reconstructed the recordings with marker tracking simulations, coordinate tracking simulations, and inverse kinematics and dynamics. First, we analyzed the convergence of the simulations and found that the wall time increased three to four times when using marker tracking compared to coordinate tracking. Then, we compared the marker trajectories, ground reaction forces, pelvis translations, joint angles, and joint moments between the three reconstruction methods. Root mean squared deviations between measured and estimated marker positions were smallest for inverse kinematics (e.g., 7.6 {+/-} 5.1 mm for v-cut). However, measurement noise and soft tissue artifacts are likely also tracked in inverse kinematics, meaning that this approach does not reflect a gold standard. Marker tracking simulations resulted in slightly higher root mean squared marker deviations (e.g., 9.5 {+/-} 6.2 mm for v-cut) than inverse kinematics. In contrast, coordinate tracking resulted in deviations that were nearly twice as high (e.g., 16.8 {+/-} 10.5 mm for v-cut). Joint angles from coordinate tracking followed the estimated joint angles from inverse kinematics more closely than marker tracking (e.g., root mean squared deviation of 1.4 {+/-} 1.8 deg vs. 3.5 {+/-} 4.0 deg for v-cut). However, we did not have a gold standard measurement of the joint angles, so it is unknown if this larger deviation means the solution is less accurate. In conclusion, we showed that optimal control simulations of change of direction running motions can be created by tracking marker and ground reaction force data. Marker tracking considerably improved marker accuracy compared to coordinate tracking. Therefore, we recommend reconstructing movements by directly tracking marker data in the optimal control simulation when precise marker tracking is required.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHuman traits are typically represented in both the biomedical literature and large population studies as descriptive text strings. Whilst a number of ontologies exist, none of these perfectly represent the entire human phenome and exposome. Mapping trait names across large datasets is therefore time-consuming and challenging. Recent developments in language modelling have created new methods for semantic representation of words and phrases, and these methods offer new opportunities to map human trait names in the form of words and short phrases, both to ontologies and to each other. Here we present a comparison between a range of established and more recent language modelling approaches for the task of mapping trait names from UK Biobank to the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO), and also explore how they compare to each other in direct trait-to-trait mapping.\n\nResultsIn our analyses of 1191 traits from UK Biobank with manual EFO mappings, the BioSentVec model performed best at predicting these, matching 40.3% of the manual mappings correctly. The BlueBERT-EFO model (finetuned on EFO) performed nearly as well (38.8% of traits matching the manual mapping). In contrast, Levenshtein edit distance only mapped 22% of traits correctly. Pairwise mapping of traits to each other demonstrated that many of the models can accurately group similar traits based on their semantic similarity.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationOur code is available at https://github.com/MRCIEU/vectology.",

    "abstract": "Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in controlling signaling pathways within the immune cells. Recent studies reported that the higher expression levels of TNF- is associated with the progression of several diseases including cancers, cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 and autoimmune disorders. Thus, it is the need of the hour to develop immunotherapies or subunit vaccines to manage TNF- progression in various disease conditions. In the pilot study, we have proposed a host-specific in-silico tool for the prediction, designing and scanning of TNF- inducing epitopes. The prediction models were trained and validated on the experimentally validated TNF- inducing/non-inducing for human and mouse hosts. Firstly, we developed alignment free (machine learning based models using composition of peptides) methods for predicting TNF- inducing peptides and achieved maximum AUROC of 0.79 and 0.74 for human and mouse hosts, respectively. Secondly, alignment based (using BLAST) method has been used for predicting TNF- inducing epitopes. Finally, a hybrid method (combination of alignment free and alignment-based method) has been developed for predicting epitopes. Our hybrid method achieved maximum AUROC of 0.83 and 0.77 on an independent dataset for human and mouse hosts, respectively.

    "abstract": "A mechanistic understanding of the biological and technical factors that impact cell and nuclear transcript measurements is essential to designing, analyzing, and interpreting single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing experiments. RNA sampling in nuclei and cells is fundamentally different as nuclei contain the same pre-mRNA population as cells, yet contain a small subset of the largely-cytoplasmic mRNAs. Nonetheless, early studies argued that including pre-mRNA in single-nucleus analysis led to results comparable to cellular samples. However, typical bioinformatic workflows do not distinguish between pre-mRNA and mRNA when analyzing gene expression, and variation in the relative abundance of pre-mRNA and mRNA across cell types has received limited attention. These gaps are especially important given that incorporating pre-mRNA in routine gene expression analysis is now commonplace for both assays, despite known gene length bias in pre-mRNA capture. Here, we reanalyze public datasets from mouse and human to describe the mechanisms and contrasting effects of mRNA and pre-mRNA sampling in single-cell and nucleus RNA-seq. We disentangle the roles of bioinformatic processing, assay choice, and biological variability on measured gene expression and marker gene selection. We show that pre-mRNA levels vary considerably among cell types, which mediates the degree of gene length bias within and between assays and limits the generalizability of a recently-published normalization method intended to correct for this bias. As an alternative solution, we demonstrate the applicability of an existing post hoc gene length-based correction method developed for conventional RNA-seq gene set enrichment analysis. Finally, we show that the inclusion of pre-mRNA in bioinformatic processing can impart a larger effect on gene expression estimates than the choice of cell versus nuclear assay, which is pivotal to the effective reuse of existing data. Broadly, these analyses advance our understanding of the biological and technical factors underlying variation in single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq experiments to promote more informed choices in experimental design, data analysis, and data sharing and reuse.",

    "abstract": "Advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies have enabled the gene expression profiling of tissues while retaining its spatial context. Effective exploitation of this data combination requires spatially informed analysis tools to perform three key tasks, spatial clustering, multi-sample integration, and cell type deconvolution. Here, we present GraphST, a novel graph self-supervised contrastive learning method that incorporates spatial location information and gene expression profiles to accomplish all three tasks in a streamlined process while outperforming existing methods in each task. GraphST combines graph neural networks with self-supervised contrastive learning to learn informative and discriminative spot representations by minimizing the embedding distance between spatially adjacent spots and vice versa. With GraphST, we achieved 10% higher clustering accuracy on multiple datasets than competing methods, and better delineated the fine-grained structures in tissues such as the brain and embryo. Moreover, GraphST is the only method that can jointly analyze multiple tissue slices in both vertical and horizontal integration while correcting for batch effects. Lastly, compared to other methods, GraphSTs cell type deconvolution achieved higher accuracy on simulated data and better captured spatial niches such as the germinal centers of the lymph node in experimentally acquired data. We further showed that GraphST can recover the immune cell distribution in different regions of breast tumor tissue and reveal spatial niches with exhausted tumor infiltrating T cells. Through our examples, we demonstrated that GraphST is widely applicable to a broad range of tissue types and technology platforms. In summary, GraphST is a streamlined, user friendly and computationally efficient tool for characterizing tissue complexity and gaining biological insights into the spatial organization within tissues.",

    "abstract": "DNA loop extrusion by structural-maintenance-of-chromosome (SMC) complexes has emerged as a primary organizing principle for chromosomes. The mechanism by which SMC motor proteins extrude DNA loops is still unresolved and much debated. The ring-like structure of SMC complexes prompted multiple models where the extruded DNA is topologically or pseudotopologically entrapped within the ring during loop extrusion. However, recent experiments showed the passage of roadblocks much bigger than the SMC ring size, suggesting a nontopological mechanism. Recently, attempts were made to reconcile the observed passage of large roadblocks with a pseudotopological mechanism. Here we examine the predictions of these pseudotopological models, and find that they are not consistent with some experimental data on SMC roadblock encounters. Particularly, these models predict the formation of two loops and that roadblocks will reside near the stem of the loop upon encounter - both in contrast to experimental observations. Overall, the experimental data reinforce the notion of a nontopological mechanism for extrusion of DNA.",

    "abstract": "Despite its significance to reproduction, fertility, sexually transmitted infections and various pathologies, the fallopian tube (FT) is relatively understudied. Strong evidence points to the FT as the tissue-of-origin of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most fatal gynaecological malignancy. HGSOC precursor lesions arise specifically in the distal FT (fimbria) which is reported to be enriched in stem-like cells. Investigation of the role of FT stem cells in health and disease has been hampered by a lack of characterization of FT stem cells and lack of models that recapitulate stem cell renewal and differentiation in vitro. Using optimized organoid culture conditions to address these limitations, we found that FT stem cell renewal is highly dependent on WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling and engineered endogenous WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling reporter organoids to biomark, isolate and characterize putative FT stem cells. Using functional approaches as well as bulk and single cell transcriptomic analyses, we show that an endogenous hormonally-regulated WNT7A-FZD5 signaling axis is critical for self-renewal of human FT stem cells, and that WNT/{beta}-catenin pathway-activated FT cells form a distinct transcriptomic cluster of cells enriched in ECM remodelling and integrin signaling pathways. In addition, we find that the WNT7A-FZD5 signaling axis is dispensable for mouse oviduct regeneration. Overall, we provide a deep characterization of FT stem cells and their molecular requirements for self-renewal, paving the way for mechanistic work investigating the role of stem cells in FT health and disease.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=165 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/502319v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@124d8a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9f92borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c57b33org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b5bec_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "There is a lack of data on the effects of chronic exposure to common drugs and stimulants on the developing nervous system. Freshwater planarians have emerged as a useful invertebrate model amenable to high-throughput behavioral phenotyping to assay chemical safety in adult and developing brains. Here, we leverage the unique strength of the system to test in parallel for effects on the adult and developing nervous system, by screening ten common drugs and stimulants (forskolin, clenbuterol, LRE-1, MDL-12,330A, adenosine, caffeine, histamine, mianserin, fluoxetine and sertraline) using the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica. The compounds were tested up to 100 {micro}M nominal concentration for their effects on planarian morphology and behavior. Quantitative phenotypic assessments were performed on days 7 and 12 of exposure using an automated screening platform. The antidepressants sertraline and fluoxetine were the most potent to induce lethality, with significant lethality observed at 10 {micro}M. All ten compounds caused sublethal morphological and/or behavioral effects, with the most effects, in terms of potency and breadth of endpoints affected, seen with mianserin and fluoxetine. Four of the compounds (forskolin, clenbuterol, mianserin, and fluoxetine) were developmentally selective, causing effects at lower concentrations in regenerating planarians. Of these, fluoxetine showed the greatest differences between the two developmental stages, inducing many behavioral endpoints in regenerating planarians but only a few in adult planarians. While some of these behavioral effects may be due to neuroefficacy, these results substantiate the need for better evaluation of the safety of these common drugs on the developing nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Synovial Fibroblasts (SFs) are key pathogenic drivers in arthritis and their in vivo activation by TNF is sufficient to orchestrate full arthritic pathogenesis in animal models. TNF blockade has been efficacious for a large percentage of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients, although characterized by a plethora of side effects. Novel therapeutic discoveries remain however challenging, especially in optimizing drug safety, side effects, longer-term responses, costs and administration routes. Aiming to find new potent therapeutics, we applied the L1000CDS2 search engine, in order to identify compounds that could potentially reverse the pathogenic expression signature of arthritogenic SFs, derived from the human TNF transgenic mouse model (hTNFtg). We identified a neuroleptic drug, namely Amisulpride, which was validated to reduce SFs inflammatory potential while decreasing the clinical score of hTNFtg polyarthritis. Notably, we found that Amisulpride did not exert its biological activities through its known targets Dopamine receptors 2 and 3 and Serotonin Receptor 7, nor through TNF-TNFRI binding inhibition. By applying a click chemistry approach, novel potential targets of Amisulpride were identified, which were further validated to repress hTNFtg SFs inflammatory potential in vitro (Ascc3 and Sec62), while phosphoproteomics analysis revealed important fibroblast activation pathways, such as adhesion, to be altered upon treatment. Our data support that Amisulpride could provide an additive beneficial effect to patients suffering from RA and comorbid dysthymia, as it may reduce SFs pathogenicity in parallel with its anti-depressive activity. Importantly, Amisulpride may also serve as a \"lead\" compound for the development of novel, more potent therapeutics against chronic inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Under the condition of low light, the yield of summer maize decreased significantly, but the decrease of yield under low light stress was not only caused by the lack of photosynthetic assimilates in leaves, but also the transportation and utilization of assimilates by stems and grains. In this study, we investigated the effects of low light stress on leaves, stems and grains of summer maize and the relationship between them. The results showed that the synthesis ability of sucrose and export sucrose to grains ability in leaves decreased under low light. Due to dry matter transfer, the number and area of small vascular bundles in spike node and shank decreased, which restricted the translocation of photoassimilates to grains at filling stage. The activities of SUS and AGPase was decreased in grains under low light stress, which limited the availability of sucrose. The process of leaf synthesis, sucrose loading and sucrose utilization in grains was affected under low light, resulting in relatively higher sucrose concentration in grains than in leaves, forming a \"leaf low\" - \"grain high\" sugar concentration gradient, resulting in the opposite hydrostatic pressure, and then feedback inhibition of sucrose output in leaves, reducing sucrose loading and transportation rate.\n\nHightlightThe key factor of low light stress reducing summer maize yield was the decrease of leaf photosynthetic rate, resulting in insufficient grain dry matter supply. The sugar concentration gradient between leaves and grains further restricted the sucrose transport from leaves to grains.",

    "abstract": "The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruit is of major importance for the nutrition of broad populations in the worlds desert strip; yet this crop is sorely understudied. Understanding the mechanisms regulating date fruit development and ripening is essential to customise this crop to the climatic change, which elaborates yield losses due to often too early occurring wet season. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism regulating date fruit ripening. To that end, we followed the natural process of date fruit development and the effects of exogenous hormone application on fruit ripening in the elite cultivar  Medjool. The results of the current study indicate that the onset of fruit ripening occurred once the seed had reached maximum dry weight. From this point until fruit harvest, the pulp endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) turned up and its levels consistently increased. The final stage in fruit ripening, the yellow-to-brown transition, was preceded by an arrest of xylem-mediated water transport into the fruit. Exogenous ABA application enhanced fruit ripening when applied just prior to the green-to-yellow fruit color transition. Repeated ABA applications hastened all fruit ripening processes, resulting in a significantly earlier harvest. The emerging pivotal role of ABA in the regulation of date fruit ripening is thoroughly discussed.\n\nHighlightsThe plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) promotes date fruit ripening, as indicated by the enhanced change in fruit color, from green to yellow, and the enhanced rate of sugar accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplasts can respond to stress and changes in the environment by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Aside from being cytotoxic, ROS also have signaling capabilities. For example, the ROS singlet oxygen (1O2) can initiate nuclear gene expression, chloroplast degradation, and cell death. To unveil the signaling mechanisms involved, researchers have used several 1O2-producing Arabidopsis thaliana mutants as genetic model systems, including plastid ferrochelatase two (fc2), fluorescent in blue light (flu), chlorina 1 (ch1), and accelerated cell death 2 (acd2). Here, we compare these 1O2-producing mutants to elucidate if they utilize one or more signaling pathways to control cell death and nuclear gene expression. Using publicly available transcriptomic data, we demonstrate fc2, flu, and ch1 share a core response to 1O2 accumulation, but maintain unique responses, potentially tailored to respond to their specific stresses. Subsequently, we used a genetic approach to determine if these mutants share 1O2 signaling pathways by testing the ability of genetic suppressors of one 1O2 producing mutant to suppress signaling in a different 1O2 producing mutant. Our genetic analyses revealed at least two different chloroplast 1O2 signaling pathways control cellular degradation: one specific to the flu mutant and one shared by fc2, ch1, and acd2 mutants, but with life-stage-specific (seedling vs. adult) features. Overall, this work reveals chloroplast stress signaling involving 1O2 is complex and may allow cells to finely tune their physiology to environmental inputs.",

Here, we quantify the degradation rates of [~]3.2k E. coli proteins under 12 conditions by combining heavy isotope labeling with complement reporter ion quantification and find that cytoplasmic proteins are recycled when nitrogen is limited. We use knockout experiments to assign substrates to the known cytoplasmic ATP-dependent proteases. Surprisingly, none of these proteases are responsible for the observed cytoplasmic protein degradation in nitrogen limitation, suggesting that a major proteolysis pathway in E. coli remains to be discovered. Lastly, we show that protein degradation rates are generally independent of cell division rates. Thus, we introduce broadly applicable technology for protein turnover measurements and provide a rich resource for protein half-lives and protease substrates in E. coli, complementary to genomics data, that will allow researchers to decipher the control of proteostasis.",

    "abstract": "It has been postulated that information processing in the brain is based on precise temporal correlation of neural activity across populations of neurons. In a recent study we found spatio-temporal spike patterns in experimental recordings from monkey motor cortex, and here we study if those could be explained by a synfire chain (SFC) like model. The model is composed of groups of neurons connected in feed-forward manner from one group to the next with high convergence and divergence. When activated, e.g., by a current pulse to the first group, spiking activity in the SFC is synchronous within neurons of the same group and propagates from group to group. When a few neurons from different groups are recorded from such an SFC, and the SFC is repeatedly activated, we would find a spatio-temporal spike pattern repeating across trials. Here, we take the statistics of the STPs found in the experimental data from 20 sessions as a reference to compare to a simulated network. Distributions of the data we take into account include 1) the pattern sizes, i.e. the number of neurons involved in the patterns, 2) the number of patterns a single neuron is involved in, 3) the durations of the patterns, and 4) the spatial distances of the patterns across the electrode array used to record the data. For the simulations, we embed SFC(s) in an anatomical model of the respective layer of the motor cortex, defined by its height and the density of the neurons. Model parameters are the length of the SFC, the number of neurons per group, the spatial extent of each neuronal group, and the distance between subsequent groups. Given the size and reach of the Utah array electrodes, we derive the probability of recording neurons from the SFC network. An SFC is considered detected if at least two neurons from two different groups are recorded. We find that depending on the model parameters, an embedded SFC can be detected with high probability, despite the massive subsampling of the cortex by the Utah array. Furthermore, to achieve multiple membership of a neuron in different patterns, we embed multiple SFCs that overlap. The fitting of the model to the pattern data constrains the spatial SFC parameters: the chains have to be broadly distributed in space and contain many neurons per group to match the experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Self-organized criticality is a hallmark of complex dynamic systems at phase transitions. Systems that operate at or near criticality have large-scale fluctuations or \"avalanches\", the frequency and duration power of which are best fit with a power law revealing them to be scale-free and fractal, and such power laws are ubiquitous. It is an attractive concept in neuroscience since spiking avalanches are exhibited by neural tissue, and may underpin how minuscule events could scale up to circuits and provide adaptive psychobiological function. Much is yet to be understood about criticality in vivo in the healthy brain and in disorders such as addiction, as drugs may alter the critical states \"tuning\" to generate drug seeking and dysphoria. Thus, here a novel toolset was developed to use neural avalanches and their self-similarity, rather than power law fit slope exponents as is canonically done, to quantify criticality in a previously collected high-density electrophysiological in vivo corticostriatal dataset from a mouse model of early cocaine abstinence. During behavioral quiescence, in the prefrontal cortex but not ventral striatum of cocaine-dosed mice, it was found that critical tuning is enhanced compared to drug-free controls. Additionally, an empirical biological demonstration of complexitys theoretical correlation to criticality was shown in drug-free mice, was exponentially enhanced in drug-treated cortex, but was absent in the drug-treated striatum. As shown, quantifying criticality grants experimental support for the \"critical brain hypothesis\" and allows for statistical interpretation of inter-subject variability and development of further testable hypotheses in systems neuroscience.\n\nSignificance StatementThe \"critical brain hypothesis\" asserts neural networks are comparable to material in phase transitions at a critical point, their \"avalanches\" of system-wide spike bursts best seen in log-log plots of probability vs. avalanche size or duration, with slope following a scale-free or fractal power law. In discussing criticality, \"critical tuning\" is mentioned but quantification thereof left for later experimentation, despite being necessary for a scientific hypothesis. Presented are methods to quantify critical tuning through assessing similarity or fractalness among corticostriatal avalanches collected using high-density electrophysiology in cocaine-conditioned mice, along with an empirical in vivo confirmation of the mathematical concept that data complexity correlates with criticality. Interestingly, cocaine enhances critical tuning in cortex and aberrantly modifies complexity in a region-specific manner.",

However, this dogma contrasts with the phenomenon of rapid adaptation, in which the magnitude of neuronal activation drops dramatically in a rapid manner, while the visual stimulus and the conscious experience it elicits remain stable. Here we report that the profiles of multi-site activation patterns and their relational geometry -i.e. the similarity distances between activation patterns, as revealed using iEEG recordings, are sustained during extended stimulation despite the major magnitude decrease. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that conscious perceptual content is associated with the neuronal pattern profiles and their similarity distances, rather than by the overall activation magnitude, in human visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is among the most used algorithms to perform neuroimaging meta-analysis. Since its first implementation, several thresholding procedures had been proposed, all referred to the frequentist framework, returning a rejection criterion for the null hypothesis according to the critical p-value selected. However, this is not informative in terms of probabilities of the validity of the hypotheses. Here, we describe an innovative thresholding procedure based on the concept of minimum Bayes factor (mBF). The use of the Bayesian framework allows to consider different levels of probability, each of these being equally significant. In order to simplify the translation between the common ALE practice and the proposed approach, we analised six task-fMRI/VBM datasets and determined the mBF values equivalent to the currently recommended frequentist thresholds based on Family Wise Error (FWE). Sensitivity and robustness toward spurious findings were also analyzed. Results showed that the cutoff log10(mBF)=5 is equivalent to the FWE threshold, often referred as voxel-level threshold, while the cutoff log10(mBF)=2 is equivalent to the cluster-level FWE (c-FWE) threshold. However, only in the latter case voxels spatially far from the blobs of effect in the c-FWE ALE map survived. Therefore, when using the Bayesian thresholding the cutoff log10(mBF)=5 should be preferred. However, being in the Bayesian framework, lower values are all equally significant, while suggesting weaker level of force for that hypothesis. Hence, results obtained through less conservative thresholds can be legitimately discussed without losing statistical rigor. The proposed technique adds therefore a powerful tool to the human-brain-mapping field.",

    "abstract": "The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is a hub for body sensation of both innocuous and noxious signals, yet its role in somatosensation versus pain is debated. Despite known contributions of S1 to sensory gain modulation, its causal involvement in subjective sensory experiences remains elusive. Here, in mouse S1, we reveal the involvement of cortical output neurons in layers 5 (L5) and 6 (L6) in the perception of innocuous and noxious somatosensory signals. We find that L6 activation can drive aversive hypersensitivity and spontaneous nocifensive behavior. Linking behavior to neuronal mechanisms, we find that L6 enhances thalamic somatosensory responses, and in parallel, strongly suppresses L5 neurons. Directly suppressing L5 reproduced the pronociceptive phenotype induced by L6 activation, suggesting an anti-nociceptive function for L5 output. Indeed, L5 activation reduced sensory sensitivity and reversed inflammatory allodynia. Together, these findings reveal a layer-specific and bidirectional role for S1 in modulating subjective sensory experiences.",

    "abstract": "What drives us to search for creative ideas, and why does it feel good to find one? While previous studies demonstrated the positive influence of motivation on creative abilities, how reward and subjective values play a role in creativity remains unknown. This study proposes to characterize the role of individual preferences (how people value ideas) in creative ideation via behavioral experiments and computational modeling. Using the Free Generation of Associates Task coupled with rating tasks, we demonstrate the involvement of valuation processes during idea generation: preferred ideas are provided faster. We found that valuation depends on the adequacy and originality of ideas and guides response selection and creativity. Finally, our computational model correctly predicts the speed and quality of human creative responses, as well as interindividual differences in creative abilities. Altogether, this model introduces the mechanistic role of valuation in creativity. It paves the way for a neurocomputational account of creativity mechanisms.\n\nPublic Significance StatementThis study addresses the role of individual preferences in creativity. It demonstrates that preferences for ideas energize creative idea production: the more participants like their ideas, the faster they provide them. Moreover, preferences rely on an equilibrium between the adequacy and originality of ideas and vary across individuals. This study introduces a computational model which incorporates individual preferences and that correctly predicts the speed and quality of responses in a creative idea generation task, as well as inter-individual differences in creative abilities. Comparison of several versions of this model demonstrated that preferences guide the selection of creative responses.",

    "abstract": "A large body of work has identified characteristic neural signatures of value-based decision-making. A core circuit has been shown to track the values of options under consideration, and the dynamics of neural activity associated with this circuit have been found to closely resemble the ramping evidence accumulation process believed to underpin goal-directed choice, most notably in the centroparietal positivity (CPP). However, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that value-based choices trigger multiple value-related neural signatures, some of which are unrelated to decision-making per se but instead reflect reflexive affective reactions to ones options. Here, we use the temporal resolution of EEG to test whether choice-independent value signals could be dissociated from well-known temporal signatures of the choice process. We show that EEG activity during value-based choice can be decomposed into distinct spatiotemporal clusters, one stimulus-locked (associated with the affective salience of a choice set) and one response-locked (associated with the difficulty of selecting the best option). We show that neither of these clusters meet the criteria for an evidence accumulation signal. Instead, and to our surprise, we find across two studies that stimulus-locked activity can mimic an evidence accumulation process when aligned to the response (as with the CPP). We then re-analyze four previous studies that demonstrate an evidence accumulation signal in the CPP - one during value-based decision-making, the others during perceptual decision-making - and show that this signal disappears when stimulus-locked and response-locked signals are jointly accounted for. Collectively, our findings show that neural signatures of value can reflect choice-independent processes that when analyzed using standard approaches, can look deceptively like evidence accumulation.\n\nSignificance StatementTo choose, people must evaluate their options and select between them. Selection is well described by a process of accumulating evidence up to some threshold, with an electrophysiological signature in the centroparietal positivity (CPP). However, decision-making also gives rise to value signals reflecting affective reactions and other selection-unrelated processes. Measuring EEG while participants made value-based choices, we identified two spatiotemporally distinct value signals, neither reflecting evidence accumulation. Instead, we show that evidence accumulation signals found in the CPP can arise artifactually from overlapping stimulus- and response-related activity. These findings call for a significant reexamination of established links between neural and computational mechanisms of choice, while inviting deeper consideration of the array of cognitive and affective processes that occur in parallel.",

We have recently shown that microtubule severing, via the action of the meiotic AAA ATPase protein clade, plays a critical role in this process. Here, we sought to elucidate the roles of spastin, an as yet unexplored member of this clade in spermatogenesis. Using a SpastKO/KO mouse model, we reveal that spastin loss resulted in a complete loss of functional germ cells. Spastin plays a critical role in the assembly and function of the male meiotic spindle, and in its absence, apoptosis is significantly increased. Consistent with meiotic failure, round spermatid nuclei were enlarged, indicating aneuploidy, but were still able to enter spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, we observed extreme abnormalities in manchette structure, supernumerary acrosome formation, and commonly, a loss of nuclear integrity. This work defines a novel and essential role for spastin in regulating microtubule dynamics during spermatogenesis and is of potential relevance to patients carrying Spastin variants and to the medically assisted reproductive technology industry.\n\nSummary statementWe identify an essential role for the microtubule severing enzyme spastin in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Plant-associated microbial communities are key to shaping many aspects of plant biology, including their fitness, ecology, and evolution. While several studies focused on testing the effect of different factors (e.g., plant genotype, soil, biotic and abiotic stressors) on the assembly of plant microbiomes, we still know little about the possible mechanisms that drive these effects. In this study we tested whether soil microbial community and herbivory influence the microbial community of tomato plants, and whether their influence in different plant compartments is driven by active (via plant) or passive (via microbial spillover) mechanisms. We grew our plants in soils hosting three different microbial communities, we covered (or not) the soil surface to prevent (or allow) passive microbial spillover between compartments, and we exposed them (or not) to herbivory by Manduca sexta. Results suggest that, while microbiomes mainly differentiated by compartment (rhizosphere, roots, leaves, herbivore), soil microbial community followed by herbivory influenced the structure of plant-associated microbial communities. The soil-driven effect was detected regardless of soil coverage, suggesting that this effect might be mediated by the plant. On the other hand, we found that the herbivore-driven effect on the rhizosphere microbiota was detected only when the soil cover was absent, suggesting that this effect might be driven by passive microbial spillover (e.g., via frass). These results promote understanding of the drivers of plant microbiome assembly, their relative strength, and the mechanisms behind them.",

    "abstract": "The placenta is an organ with extraordinary phenotypic diversity in eutherian mammals. Recent evidence suggests that numerous human placental enhancers are evolved from lineage-specific insertions of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), yet the transcription factors (TFs) underlying their regulation remain largely elusive. Here, by first focusing on MER41, a primate-specific ERV family previously linked to placenta and innate immunity, we uncover the binding motifs of multiple crucial trophoblast TFs (GATA2/3, MSX2, GRHL2) in addition to innate immunity TFs STAT1 and IRF1. Integration of ChIP-Seq data confirms the binding of GATA2/3, MSX2 and their related factors on the majority of MER41-derived enhancers in human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Notably, MER41-derived enhancers that are constitutively active in human TSCs are distinct from those activated upon interferon stimulation, which is determined by the binding of relevant TFs and their sub-family compositions. We further demonstrate that GATA2/3 and MSX2 have prevalent binding on numerous other ERV families - indicating their broad impact on ERV-derived enhancers. Functionally, the derepression of many syncytiotrophoblast genes after disruption of MSX2 is likely to be mediated by regulatory elements derived from ERVs - suggesting ERVs are also important for mediating transcriptional repression. Overall, this study characterized the prevalent regulation of GATA2/3, MSX2 and their co-factors on ERV-derived regulatory elements in human TSCs and provided mechanistic insights into the importance of ERVs in human trophoblast regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "To ensure dosage compensation for X-linked genes between the sexes, one X chromosome is silenced during early embryonic development of female mammals. This process of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated through upregulation of the RNA Xist from one X chromosome shortly after fertilization. Xist then mediates chromosome-wide gene silencing in cis and remains expressed in all cell types except the germ line and the pluripotent state, where XCI is reversed. The factors that drive Xist upregulation and thereby initiate XCI remain however unknown. We identify GATA transcription factors as potent Xist activators and demonstrate that they are essential for the activation of Xist in mice following fertilization. Through a pooled CRISPR activation screen we find that GATA1 can drive ectopic Xist expression in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We demonstrate that all GATA factors can activate Xist directly via a GATA-responsive regulatory element (RE79) positioned 100 kb upstream of the Xist promoter. Additionally, GATA factors are essential for the induction of XCI in mouse preimplantation embryos, as simultaneous deletion of three members of the GATA family (GATA1/4/6) in mouse zygotes effectively prevents Xist upregulation. Thus, initiation of XCI and possibly its maintenance in distinct lineages of the preimplantation embryo is ensured by the combined activity of different GATA family members, and the absence of GATA factors in the pluripotent state likely contributes to X reactivation. We thus describe a form of regulation in which the combined action of numerous tissue-specific factors can achieve near-ubiquitous expression of a target gene.",

    "abstract": "1Although it is heavily relied on to study genetic contributors to health and disease, the current human reference genome (GRCh38) is incomplete in two major ways: firstly, it is missing large sections of heterochromatic sequence, and secondly, as a singular, linear reference genome it does not represent the full spectrum of genetic diversity that exists in the human species. In order to better understand and characterize gaps in GRCh38 and genetic diversity, we developed a method - ASLAN, an Algorithm for Sequence Location Approximation using Nuclear families - that identifies the region of origin of short reads that do not align to the GRCh38. Using unmapped reads and variant calls from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from nuclear families, ASLAN relies on a maximum likelihood model to identify the most likely region of the genome that a subsequence belongs to, given the phasing information of family and the distribution of the subsequence in the unmapped reads. Validating ASLAN on a synthetically generated dataset, and on true reads originating from the alternative haplotypes in the decoy genome, we show that ASLAN can localize more than 90% of 100-basepair sequences with above 92% accuracy and around 1 megabase of resolution. We then run ASLAN on 100-mers from unmapped reads from WGS from over 700 families, and compare ASLAN localizations to alignment of the 100-mers to the T2T-CHM13 assembly, recently released by the Telomere-to-telomere (T2T) consortia. We find that many unmapped reads in GRCh38 originate from telomeres and centromeres that are gaps in the GRCh38 reference. We also confirm that ASLAN localizations are in high concordance with T2T-CHM13 alignments, except in the centromeres of the acrocentric chromosomes. Comparing ASLAN localizations and T2T-CHM13 alignments, we identify sequences missing from T2T-CHM13 or sequences with high divergence from their aligned region in T2T-CHM13, thus highlighting new hotspots for genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "The correct evaluation of ligand binding free energies by computational methods is still a very challenging active area of research. The most employed methods for these calculations can be roughly classified into four groups: (i) the fastest and less accurate methods, such as molecular docking, designed to sample a large number of molecules and rapidly rank them according to the potential binding energy; (ii) the second class of methods use a thermodynamic ensemble, typically generated by molecular dynamics, to analyze the endpoints of the thermodynamic cycle for binding and extract differences, in the so-called  end-point methods; (iii) the third class of methods is based on the Zwanzig relationship and computes the free energy difference after a chemical change of the system (alchemical methods); and (iv) methods based on biased simulations, such as metadynamics, for example. These methods require increased computational power and as expected, result in increased accuracy for the determination of the strength of binding. Here, we describe an intermediate approach, based on the Monte Carlo Recursion (MCR) method first developed by Harold Scheraga. In this method, the system is sampled at increasing effective temperatures, and the free energy of the system is assessed from a series of terms W(b, T), computed from Monte Carlo (MC) averages at each iteration. We show the application of the MCR for ligand binding with datasets of guest-hosts systems (N=75) and we observed that a good correlation is obtained between experimental data and the binding energies computed with MCR. We also compared the experimental data with an end-point calculation from equilibrium Monte Carlo calculations that allowed us to conclude that the lower-energy (lower-temperature) terms in the calculation are the most relevant to the estimation of the binding energies, resulting in similar correlations between MCR and MC data and the experimental values. On the other hand, the MCR method provides a reasonable view of the binding energy funnel, with possible connections with the ligand binding kinetics, as well. The codes developed for this analysis are publicly available on GitHub as a part of the LiBELa/MCLiBELa project (https://github.com/alessandronascimento/LiBELa).",
