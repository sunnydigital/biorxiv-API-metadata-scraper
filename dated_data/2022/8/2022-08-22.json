    "abstract": "Continued evolution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 has lead to more transmissible and immune-evasive variants with profound impact on the course of the pandemic. Here I analyze the evolution of the virus over 2.5 years since its emergence and estimate rates of evolution for synonymous and non-synonymous changes separately for evolution within clades - well defined mono-phyletic groups with gradual evolution - and for the pandemic overall. The rate of synonymous mutations is found to be around 6 changes per year. Synonymous rates within variants vary little from variant to variant and are compatible with the overall rate of 7 changes per year (or 7.5 x 10-4 per year and codon). In contrast, the rate at which variants accumulate amino acid changes (non-synonymous mutation) was initially around 12-16 changes per year, but in 2021 and 2022 dropped to 6-9 changes per year. The overall rate of non-synonymous evolution, that is across variants, is estimated to be about 26 amino acid changes per year (or 2.7 x 10-3 per year and codon). This strong acceleration of the overall rate compared to within clade evolution indicates that the evolutionary process that gave rise to the different variants is qualitatively different from that in typical transmission chains and likely dominated by adaptive evolution. I further quantify the spectrum of mutations and purifying selection in different SARS-CoV-2 proteins and show that the massive global sampling of SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient to estimate site specific fitness costs across the entire genome. Many accessory proteins evolve under limited evolutionary constraint with little short term purifying selection. About half of the mutations in other proteins are strongly deleterious.",

    "abstract": "Humans are generally risk averse: they prefer options with smaller certain outcomes over those with larger uncertain ones. This risk aversion is classically explained with a concave utility function, meaning that successive increases in monetary payoffs should increase subjective valuations by progressively smaller amounts. Here, we provide neural and behavioural evidence that risk aversion may also arise from a purely perceptual bias: The noisy logarithmic coding of numerical magnitudes can lead individuals to underestimate the size of larger monetary payoffs, leading to apparent risk aversion even when subjective valuation increases linearly with the estimated amount. A formal model of this process predicts that risk aversion should systematically increase when individuals represent numerical magnitudes more noisily. We confirmed this prediction by measuring both the mental and neural acuity of magnitude representations during a purely perceptual task and relating these measures to individual risk attitudes during separate financial decisions. Computational model fitting suggested that subjects based both types of choices on similar mental magnitude representations, with correlated precision across the separate perceptual and risky choices. Increased stimulus noise due to the presentation format of risky outcomes led to increased risk aversion, just as predicted by the model. The precision of the underlying neural magnitude representations was estimated with a numerical population receptive field model fitted to the fMRI data of the perceptual task. Subjects with more precise magnitude representations in parietal cortex indeed showed less variable behaviour and less risk-aversion in the separate financial choices. Our results highlight that individual patterns of economic behaviour may, at least partially, be determined by capacity limitations in perceptual processing rather than by processes that assign subjective values to monetary rewards.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages clear invading pathogens by phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is a complex mechanism involving the local expansion of the membrane, cytoskeletal remodeling, and the delivery of phagosomal proteins to the nascent phagosomes. However, the organelle trafficking events underlying this are largely unclear. Here, we show in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages that TRPML1, a calcium channel involved in the phagocytic process, is delivered to phagosomes in Syntaxin 3-positive vesicles. Syntaxin 3 is a SNARE protein previously shown to mediate the secretion of IL-6 by macrophages. Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRF) revealed that Syntaxin 3 positive compartments carry TRPML1 to pseudopodia for focal exocytosis at the nascent phagosomes during E. coli uptake. Using siRNA knockdown, we show that both Syntaxin 3 and TRPML1 are required for E. coli uptake. Moreover, using TRPML1 agonists we show that increased TRPML1 activity leads to increased E. coli uptake, whereas calcium chelation decreased intracellular E. coli load. Understanding the membrane trafficking pathways is critical for understanding how macrophages clear invading pathogens.\n\nKey findingsO_LISyntaxin 3 positive vesicles are delivered at the plasma membrane site of phagocytosis.\nC_LIO_LISyntaxin 3-positive vesicles carry TRPML1 to pseudopodia.\nC_LIO_LIBacterial phagocytosis correlates with Syntaxin 3 and TRPML1 expression levels.\nC_LIO_LIBacterial phagocytosis depends on calcium flux through TRPML1.\nC_LIO_LISyntaxin-3 vesicles carry the cytokine interleukin-6.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposePathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is a response to cardiac stress that typically leads to heart failure. Despite being a primary contributor to pathological cardiac remodeling, the therapeutic space that targets hypertrophy is limited. Here, we apply a network model to virtually screen for FDA-approved drugs that induce or suppress cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.\n\nExperimental ApproachA logic-based differential equation model of cardiomyocyte signaling was used to predict drugs that modulate hypertrophy. These predictions were validated against curated experiments from the prior literature. The actions of midostaurin were validated in new experiments using TGF{beta}- and NE-induced hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.\n\nKey ResultsModel predictions were validated in 60 out of 70 independent experiments from the literature and identify 38 inhibitors of hypertrophy. We additionally predict that the efficacy of drugs that inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is often context dependent. We predicted that midostaurin inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by TGF{beta}, but not NE, exhibiting context dependence. We further validated this prediction by in vitro experimentation. Network analysis predicted critical roles for the PI3K and RAS pathways in the activity of celecoxib and midostaurin, respectively. We further investigated the polypharmacology and combinatorial pharmacology of drugs. Brigatinib and irbesartan in combination were predicted to synergistically inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.\n\nConclusion and ImplicationsThis study provides a well-validated platform for investigating the efficacy of drugs on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and identifies midostaurin for consideration as an antihypertrophic drug.\n\n What is already known- Cardiac hypertrophy is a leading predictor of heart failure.\n- Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is driven by intracellular signaling pathways that are not targeted by current drugs\n\n\n What this study adds- Computational model integrates 69 unique drugs to predict cardiomyocyte hypertrophy\n- Drug-induced inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is context-dependent\n- Midostaurin inhibits TGF{beta}-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy\n\n\n Clinical significance- Midostaurin is identified as a candidate antihypertrophic drug\n- Several FDA approved drugs are predicted to inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy either individually or in combination.",

    "abstract": "Flower and seed coat colour are important agronomic traits in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Cultivated chickpeas are of two types namely, desi (dark seeded, purple flower) and kabuli (light colour seeded, white flower). There has been limited information about the molecular mechanism underlying the colour variation of flower and seed coats in desi and kabuli chickpea. We profiled the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin (PA) contents in chickpea flowers and seed coats. Tissue-specific silencing of two genes encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (CabHLH) protein and a tonoplast-localized multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (CaMATE1) transporter in a desi genotype resulted in the reduction in expressions of anthocyanin and PA biosynthetic genes and anthocyanin and PA contents in the flower and seed coat and produced flowers and seeds with kabuli characteristics. Transcriptional regulation of a subset of anthocyanin and PA biosynthetic genes by a natural CabHLH variant and transport assay of a natural CaMATE1 variant explained the association of these alleles with the kabuli phenotype. We carried out a detailed molecular characterization of these genes, and provided evidences that kabuli chickpea flower and seed colour phenotype can be derived by manipulation of single genes in a desi chickpea background.\n\nHighlightIn this study, we have defined the molecular link between flower and seed color in chickpea and identified CaMATE1 and CabHLH as the regulators of both the traits.",

Our results showed that reducing connectivity decreases the neuronal synchronisation of memory neurons at slow-gamma frequencies and impairs memory recall performance. Although slow-gamma stimulation rescued memory recall and slow-gamma oscillations, the rescue with reduced connectivity caused a side effect of activating mixed memories. During the learning of a new memory, reducing connectivity caused an impairment in storing the new memory, but did not affect previously stored memories.

The participants practiced a sequence visuomotor accuracy tracking task (VATT). Online and offline effects of practice were assessed in immediate and 7-day retention tests. Participants practiced the task in seven blocks (10.6 minutes).\n\nOutcomes and ResultsThe TD-group performed better than the DS-group in all blocks (all P < 0.001). Both groups improved VATT-performance online from baseline to immediate retention (all P < 0.001). The DS-groups performance at 7-day retention was at the same level as the immediate retention tests ({Delta}DS). An offline decrease in performance was found in the TD-group ({Delta}TD, P < 0.001). A between-group difference was observed in the offline effect on the sequence task ({Delta}TD - {Delta}DS, P = 0.04).\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsThe motor performance of adults with DS is lower compared to their TD peers. However, adults with DS display significant online performance improvement during training, and offline consolidation following motor learning.\n\nWhat this paper addsLearning new motor skills is fundamental throughout our lifespan. Persons with Down syndrome have other prerequisites for learning new tasks, related to psychological, physiological, and anatomical factors imposed by the syndrome. This study is the first to investigate online and offline learning effects of a single motor skill training session in adults with DS. Our results show generally lower motor performance in DS individuals compared to the typically developed population, but with equal online learning effects. Both groups demonstrate retention, i.e., offline stabilisation but while TD demonstrate negative offline effects, this was not the case for DS. These results should be taken into consideration when planning training of motor and general life skills for adults with DS. This work lays the ground for further investigations of the trajectory of the early learning processes and the mechanisms involved when this target group acquires new skills.",

The aim of this study was to measure cognitive function in the mono-iodoacetate (MIA) rat model of chronic OA-like knee pain.\n\nWe used young adult male Lister hooded rats, which are well suited for cognitive testing. Rats received either a unilateral knee injection of MIA (3mg/50{micro}L) or saline as control. Joint pain at rest was assessed for up to 12 weeks using weight-bearing asymmetry, and referred pain at a distal site using determination of hindpaw withdrawal thresholds (PWT). The watermaze delayed-matching-to-place (DMP) test of rapid place learning, novel object recognition (NOR) memory assay and an operant response-shift and -reversal task were used to measure memory and behavioural flexibility. Open field locomotor activity, startle response, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were also measured for comparison.\n\nMIA-injected rats showed markedly reduced weight-bearing on the injured limb, as well as pronounced cartilage damage and synovitis, but interestingly no changes in PWT. Rearing was reduced, but otherwise locomotor activity was normal and no changes in startle and PPI were detected. MIA-injected rats had intact watermaze DMP performance, suggesting no substantial change in hippocampal function, and there were no changes in NOR memory or performance on the operant task of behavioural flexibility. Our finding that OA-like pain does not alter hippocampal function, unlike other chronic pain conditions, is consistent with human neuroimaging findings.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCanine heartworm is a widespread and potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease caused by infections with the parasitic nematode, Dirofilaria immitis. We have previously shown that systemic activation of the Toll immune pathway via silencing of the negative regulator Cactus in Aedes aegypti blocks parasite development in the Malpighian tubules, the mosquito renal organ. However, it was not established whether the Malpighian tubules were directly responding to Toll activation or were alternatively responding to upregulated proteins or other changes to the hemolymph driven by other tissues. Distinguishing these possibilities is crucial for developing more precise strategies to block D. immitis while potentially avoiding the fitness cost to the mosquito associated with Cactus silencing.\n\nMethodsThis study defines the transcriptional response Malpighian tubules and changes to the hemolymph proteome of Ae. aegypti after systemic Toll activation via intra-thoracic injection of dsCactus.\n\nResultsWe found Malpighian tubules significantly increase expression of Toll pathway target genes that significantly overlapped expression changes occurring in whole mosquitoes. Additionally, we identified a significant overlap between the transcriptional response of the Malpighian tubules and proteins upregulated in the hemolymph.\n\nConclusionsOur data show that Malpighian tubules are capable of RNAi-mediated gene silencing and directly respond to dsCactus treatment by upregulating canonical Toll pathway targets. Though not definitive, the strong correspondence between the Malpighian tubule transcriptional and the hemolymph proteomic responses provides evidence that the tubules may contribute to mosquito humoral immunity.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of innate immune cells that support tissue homeostasis through their involvement in tissue development and repair, and pathogen defense. Emerging data reveal that metabolism may control macrophage polarization and function and, conversely, phenotypic polarization may drive metabolic reprogramming. Here, using biochemical analysis, correlative cryogenic fluorescence microscopy and cryo-focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy, we demonstrate that growth hormone (GH) functions as a metabolic modulator to reprogram inflammatory GM-CSF-primed monocyte-derived macrophages (GM-MO). We found that exogenous treatment of GM-MO with recombinant human GH suppressed glycolysis, lactate production and non-mitochondrial respiration, and enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Likewise, GH treatment augmented mitochondrial volume and altered mitochondrial dynamics, including the remodeling of the inner membrane to increase the density of cristae. Our data demonstrate that GH likely serves a modulatory role in the metabolism of inflammatory macrophages and suggest that metabolic reprogramming of macrophages should be considered a new target to intervene in multiple inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "The expression of MHCII by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) determines the severity of intestinal immunopathological reactions. However, the function of MHCII on IEC under homeostatic conditions remains elusive. Here we report that MHCII expression on IECs is a hallmark of an adaptive wave of homeostatic intestinal immune responses to commensal segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB). Focusing on SFB-driven responses, we describe the expression pattern of MHCII and the associated antigen processing machinery among IEC subpopulations along with the cellular network that regulates MHCII induction. Furthermore, we show that SFB induce the accumulation of SFB-specific intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) that originate from conventional CD4+ T-cells. Importantly, induced IELs are dependent on the epithelial MHCII. Finally, we demonstrate that both epithelial MHCII and the IEL functionality regulate the epithelial turnover. This study describes the organization of a commensal-targeted, IEL-driven immune response that is controlled by IEC antigen presentation and ultimately regulates IEC turnover.",

    "abstract": "Latin America is one of the regions in which the COVID-19 pandemic has had a stronger impact, with more than 72 million reported infections and 1.6 million deaths until June 2022. Since this region is ecologically diverse and is affected by enormous social inequalities, efforts to identify genomic patterns of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 genotypes are necessary for the suitable management of the pandemic.\n\nTo contribute to the genomic surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 in Latin America, we extended the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available from the region by sequencing and analyzing the viral genome from COVID-19 patients from seven countries (Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Mexico, Bolivia and Peru). Subsequently, we analyzed the genomes circulating mainly during 2021 including records from GISAID database from Latin America.\n\nA total of 1534 genome sequences were generated from seven countries, demonstrating the laboratory and bioinformatics capabilities for genomic surveillance of pathogens that have been developed locally. For Latin America, patterns regarding several variants associated with multiple re-introductions, a relatively low percentage of sequenced samples, as well as an increment in the mutation frequency since the beginning of the pandemic, are in line with worldwide data. Besides, some variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) such as Gamma, Mu and Lambda, and at least 83 other lineages have predominated locally with a country-specific enrichments.\n\nThis work has contributed to the understanding of the dynamics of the pandemic in Latin America as part of the local and international efforts to achieve timely genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Archaea and bacteria use CRISPR-based adaptive immunity to limit the genome invasion by phages. Among the type-I CRISPR variant, the newly discovered type I-G exhibits unusual variation in the composition and architecture of Cas proteins. In order to understand how these structural differences, contribute to functional adaptations, we probed how the maturation of CRISPR RNA differs with respect to other well studied type I CRISPR variants. Type I-G consists of three Cas proteins, viz, Csb1, Csb2 and Csb3 that are predicted to form the ribonucleoprotein surveillance effector complex. We show that Csb2 from Bifidobacterium animalis is a metal independent endonuclease that cleaves site-specifically within the 5 region of the CRISPR repeat RNA. The catalytic activity resides within the C-terminal region that is homologous to Cas6. Interestingly, Csb2 processes the pre-CRISPR transcript both as a stand-alone enzyme and as a subunit of the Cascade/I-G complex that comprises of Csb1, Csb2 and Csb3 in association with crRNA. Surprisingly, we discovered that Csb1-which is homologous to Cas7 that is catalytically inert in other type I systems-also shows metal independent RNase activity that is functionally analogous to Csb2 in processing the pre-CRISPR RNA. The presence of dual nucleases in the Cascade/I-G complex enhances the efficiency of CRISPR-based immunity. We suggest that the Csb1 moonlighting engenders functional redundancy between Csb1 and Csb2 that in turn could compensate for the intrinsic instability of Csb2 and accelerate the maturation of crRNA.",

It is characterized by membrane permeabilization and is associated with a strong inflammatory response due to the release of intracellular components due to compromised membrane integrity. We recently showed that the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) contributes to membrane permeabilization during necroptosis. However, the mechanisms that result in the accumulation of these cytotoxic lipids remain unknown. Using comparative transcriptomics, we found that sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) is activated and that its downstream gene targets result in the accumulation of VLCFAs during necroptosis. We demonstrated that activation of SREBP1 during necroptosis exacerbates cell death. On the contrary, inactivation of SREBP1 reversed the accumulation of VLCFAs, and restored cell death and membrane permeabilization during necroptosis. Collectively, our results highlight a role for SREBP1 in regulating lipid changes during necroptosis and suggest SREBP1 as a potential target for therapeutics to reduce membrane permeabilization during necroptosis.",

We found little difference in overall transcriptional variance between the morphs but observed significant changes in chromatin openness variance. In addition, genomic divergence islands (DIs) coincided with regions of increased methylation entropy in freshwater fish. Moreover, analysis of transcription factor binding sites within DIs revealed that [C]TCF motifs around marker SNPs were significantly enriched within the region.

However, the intra-individual stability of PBL methylation in IBD has not been characterised. Here, we studied the long-term stability of all probes located on the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip array.\n\nMethodsWe followed a cohort of 46 adult IBD patients (36 Crohns disease (CD), 10 ulcerative colitis (UC), median age 44 (IQR: 27-56), 50% female) that received standard care without any intervention at the Amsterdam UMC. Paired PBL samples were collected at two time points with a median 7 (range: 2-9) years in between. Differential methylation and intra-class correlation (ICC) analyses were used to identify time-associated differences and temporally stable CpGs, respectively.\n\nResultsAround 60% of all EPIC array loci presented poor intra-individual stability (ICC <0.50); 78.114 ({approx}9%) showed good (ICC 0.75 - 0.89); and 41.274 ({approx}5%) excellent (ICC [&ge;]0.90) stability. Focusing on previously identified consistently differentially methylated positions indicated that 22 CD-, 11 UC-, and 24 IBD-associated loci demonstrated high stability (ICC [&ge;]0.75) over time; of these, we observed a marked stability of CpG loci associated to the HLA genes.\n\nConclusionOur data provide insight into the long-term stability of the PBL DNA methylome within an IBD context, facilitating the selection of biologically relevant and robust IBD-associated epigenetic biomarkers with increased potential for independent validation.

Using a draft genome to guide transcriptome assembly from RNA sequencing data, rather than performing assembly de novo, affects downstream analyses. Yet, direct comparisons of these approaches are rare. Here, we compare the results of the standard de novo assembly pipeline ( Trinity) and two reference genome-based pipelines ( Tuxedo and the  new Tuxedo) for differential expression and gene ontology enrichment analysis of a companion study on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).\n\nResultsThe new Tuxedo pipeline produced a higher quality assembly than the Tuxedo suite. However, greater enrichment of Trinity-identified differentially expressed genes suggests that a higher proportion of them represent biologically meaningful differences in transcription, as opposed to transcriptional noise or false positives. Coupled with the ability to annotate novel loci, the increased sensitivity of the Trinity pipeline might make it preferable over the reference genome-based approaches for studies aimed at broadly characterizing variation in the magnitude of expression differences and biological processes. However, the  new Tuxedo pipeline might be appropriate when a more conservative approach is warranted, such as for the identification of candidate genes.",

    "abstract": "Simulating chromatin is crucial for predicting genome organization and dynamics. Even though coarse-grained bead-spring polymer models are commonly used to describe chromatin, the relevant bead dimensions, elastic properties, and the nature of inter-bead potentials are unknown. Using publicly available nucleosome-resolution contact probability (Micro-C) data, we systematically coarse-grain chromatin and predict quantities essential for polymer representation of chromatin. We compute size distributions of chromatin beads for different coarse-graining scales, quantify fluctuations and distributions of bond lengths between neighboring regions, and derive effective spring constant values. Unlike the prevalent notion, our findings argue that coarse-grained chromatin beads must be considered as soft particles that can overlap, and we derive an effective inter-bead soft potential and quantify an overlap parameter. We also compute angle distributions between neighboring bonds giving insights into intrinsic folding and local bendability of chromatin. While the nucleosome-linker DNA bond angle naturally emerges from our work, we show that there are two populations of local structural states. The bead sizes, bond lengths, and bond angles show different mean behavior at Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundaries and TAD interiors.

    "abstract": "Single-molecule-localization-microscopy (SMLM) at cryogenic temperature opens new avenues to investigate intact biological samples at the nanoscale and perform cryo-correlative studies. Genetically encoded fluorescent proteins (FPs) are markers of choice for cryo-SMLM, but their reduced conformational flexibility below the glass transition temperature hampers efficient photoswitching at low temperature. We investigated cryo-switching of rsEGFP2, one of the most efficient reversibly switchable fluorescent protein at ambient temperature due to facile cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore. UV-visible microspectrophotometry and X-ray crystallography revealed a completely different switching mechanism at [~]110 K. At this cryogenic temperature, on-off photoswitching involves the formation of 2 dark states with blue shifted absorption relative to that of the trans protonated chromophore populated at ambient temperature. Only one of these dark states can be switched back to the fluorescent state by 405 nm light, while both of them are sensitive to UV light at 355 nm. The rsEGFP2 photoswitching mechanism discovered in this work adds to the panoply of known switching mechanisms in fluorescent proteins. It suggests that employing 355 nm light in cryo-SMLM experiments using rsEGFP2 or possibly other FPs could improve the achievable effective labeling efficiency in this technique.\n\nTable of Contents artwork\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/504779v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (76K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d5ed02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bb2359org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10dc6b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16fcd94_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Resistance to endocrine therapy is a common problem in patients with estrogen receptor alpha (ER) positive breast cancer. In this study, we took a non-biased genome-wide approach to identify novel mechanisms of endocrine resistance using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) activating (CRISPRa) screen. Results from the screen identified 109 candidate resistance-associated genes, with several of these genes, such as EGFR and SRC, having been previously associated with endocrine resistance. One candidate gene that has not been previously associated with endocrine resistance is the tyrosine kinase receptor, c-KIT. We further tested for associations between c-KIT and endocrine resistance and found that c-KIT overexpressing cells proliferate more rapidly in the presence of tamoxifen compared to control cell lines. To gain deeper insight into the potential role of c-KIT signaling in tamoxifen resistance, we next performed precision nuclear run-on and sequencing (PRO-seq) analysis of c-KIT overexpressing cells to identify downstream factors that may mediate the c-KIT response. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the overexpressed genes found that the only class of factors that was significantly induced by c-KIT was the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters; specifically, ABCA1, ABCA4, and ABCG1. Interestingly, overexpression of two of these ABC transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, significantly correlated with worse prognosis in ER+ breast cancer patients following endocrine therapy. We then tested for potential therapeutic effects of c-KIT inhibition on endocrine resistance and found that the c-KIT inhibitor Gleevec appears to synergize with tamoxifen to suppress MCF-7-S cell growth. Together, our findings support the hypothesis that c-KIT signaling promotes endocrine resistance via the induction of ABC transporter activity. Additionally, our studies suggest that inhibition of c-KIT signaling may represent a novel strategy for preventing or overcoming endocrine resistance in ER+ patients.",

    "abstract": "Plant pathogens secrete effector proteins to support host colonization through a wide range of molecular mechanisms, while plant immune systems evolved receptors to recognize effectors or their activities to mount immune responses to halt pathogens. Importantly, plants do not act as single organisms, but rather as holobionts that actively shape their microbiota as a determinant of health, and may thus be targeted by pathogen effectors as such. The soil-borne fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae was recently demonstrated to exploit the VdAve1 effector to manipulate the host microbiota to promote vascular wilt disease in absence of the corresponding immune receptor Ve1. We now identified a multiallelic V. dahliae gene displaying ~65% sequence similarity to VdAve1, named VdAve1-like (VdAve1L). Interestingly, VdAve1L shows extreme sequence variation, including alleles that encode dysfunctional proteins, indicative of selection pressure to overcome host recognition. We show that the orphan cell surface receptor Ve2, encoded at the Ve1 locus, does not recognize VdAve1L. Furthermore, we show that the full-length variant VdAve1L2 possesses antimicrobial activity, like VdAve1, yet with a divergent activity spectrum. Altogether, VdAve1L2 is exploited by V. dahliae to mediate tomato colonization through the direct suppression of antagonistic Actinobacteria in the host microbiota. Our findings open up strategies for more targeted biocontrol against microbial plant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "4H leukodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder classically characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. With the discovery that 4H is caused by mutations that affect RNA polymerase III, mainly involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, also patients with atypical presentations with mainly a neuronal phenotype were identified. Pathomechanisms of 4H brain abnormalities are still unknown and research is hampered by a lack of preclinical models. We aimed to identify cells and pathways that are affected by 4H mutations using induced pluripotent stem cell models.\n\nRNA sequencing analysis on induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebellar cells revealed several differentially expressed genes between 4H patients and control samples, including reduced ARX expression. As ARX is involved in early brain and interneuron development, we studied and confirmed interneuron changes in primary tissue of 4H patients. Subsequently, we studied interneuron changes in more depth and analyzed induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neuron cultures for changes in neuronal morphology, synaptic balance, network activity and myelination. We showed a decreased percentage of GABAergic synapses in 4H, which correlated to increased neuronal network activity. Treatment of cultures with GABA antagonists led to a significant increase in neuronal network activity in control cells but not in 4H cells, also pointing to lack of inhibitory activity in 4H. Myelination and oligodendrocyte maturation in cultures with 4H neurons was normal, and treatment with sonic hedgehog agonist SAG did not improve 4H related neuronal phenotypes. qPCR analysis revealed increased expression of parvalbumin interneuron marker ERBB4, suggesting that the development rather than generation of interneurons may be affected in 4H.\n\nTogether, these results indicate that interneurons are involved, possibly parvalbumin interneurons, in disease mechanisms of 4H leukodystrophy.",

    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis plays an important role in Parkinsons disease (PD) by acting as a route for vagal propagation of aggregated -synuclein in the gut-first endophenotype and as a mediator of gastrointestinal dyshomeostasis via the nigro-vagal pathway in the brain-first endophenotype of the disease. One important mechanism by which the gut-brain axis may promote PD is by regulating gastrointestinal redox homeostasis as overwhelming evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a key role in the etiopathogenesis and progression of PD and the gastrointestinal tract maintains redox homeostasis of the organism by acting as a critical barrier to environmental and microbiological electrophilic challenges. The present aim was to utilize the bilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) brain-first PD model to study the effects of isolated central pathology on redox homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract. Three-month-old male Wistar rats were either not treated (intact controls; CTR) or treated bilaterally intrastriatally with vehicle (CIS) or 6-OHDA (6-OHDA). Motor deficits were assessed with the rotarod performance test and the duodenum, ileum, and colon were dissected for biochemical analyses 12 weeks after the treatment. Lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity, low-molecular thiols, and protein sulfhydryls, the activity of total and Mn/Fe superoxide dismutases, and total and azide-insensitive catalase/peroxidase were measured. Univariate and multivariate models of redox biomarkers provide solid evidence against the existence of pronounced gastrointestinal redox dyshomeostasis. The results indicate that the dysfunction of the nigro-vagal system and not motor deficit may be a key mediator of gastrointestinal dyshomeostasis in brain-first 6-OHDA-induced rodent models of PD.",

    "abstract": "Multifunctional protein APE1/APEX1/HAP1/Ref-1 (designated as APE1) plays important roles in nuclease-mediated DNA repair and redox regulation in transcription. However, it is unclear how APE1 regulates the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways and influences genome integrity directly or indirectly. Here we show that siRNA-mediated APE1-knockdown or APE1 inhibitor treatment attenuates the ATR-Chk1 DDR under stress conditions in multiple immortalized cell lines. Congruently, APE1 overexpression (APE1-OE) activates the ATR DDR under unperturbed conditions, which is independent of APE1 nuclease and redox functions. Structural and functional analysis reveals a direct requirement of the extreme N-terminal 33 amino acids (NT33) within APE1 in the assembly of distinct biomolecular condensates in vitro and DNA/RNA-independent activation of the ATR DDR. Overexpressed APE1 co-localizes with nucleolar NPM1 and assembles biomolecular condensates in nucleoli in cancer but not non-malignant cells, which recruits ATR and its direct activator molecules TopBP1 and ETAA1. APE1 W119R mutant is deficient in nucleolar condensation and liquid-liquid phase separation and is incapable of activating nucleolar ATR DDR. Lastly, APE1-OE-induced nucleolar ATR DDR activation leads to compromised ribosomal RNA transcription and reduced cell viability. Taken together, we propose distinct mechanisms by which APE1 regulates ATR DDR pathways and functions in genome integrity maintenance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicroRNAs (miRNAs) and their isoforms (isomiRs), tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), and rRNA-derived fragments (rRFs) represent ~95% of all short RNAs found in cells. All three types modulate mRNA and protein abundance and are dysregulated in diseases. Experimental studies to date assumed that the subcellular localization of these molecules is well understood and constant across cell types.\n\nResultsWe investigated the localization of isomiRs, tRFs, and rRFs in biological replicates from three frequently-used model cell lines. In each case, we analyzed the contents of the nucleus, cytoplasm, whole mitochondrion, mitoplast, and the whole cell. We used a rigorous mathematical model to account for cross-fraction contamination and technical errors and adjusted abundances accordingly. We found that isomiRs, tRFs, and rRFs exhibit complex and unexpected patterns of subcellular localization. These patterns depend on the type of the RNA molecule, its exact sequence, and the cell type. Even for \"sibling\" RNAs from the same parental RNA whose sequences differ by only a few nucleotides, their subcellular localization depends on each siblings exact sequence and the cell type.\n\nConclusionsPrevious studies of isomiRs, tRFs, and rRFs that used ectopic expression without accounting for isoforms may need to be re-evaluated. Future experiments with these molecules will need to distinguish among the multiple isoforms and account for the fact that each isoforms abundance and destination depend on its exact sequence and cell type. The findings additionally suggest the existence of an intracellular trafficking program for isomiRs, tRFs, and rRFs and, by extension, expanded roles for these molecules - both dimensions await characterization.

As such, iron is a key nutrient for the development and function of erythroid cells. When iron deficient, erythroid cells are both lacking in hemoglobin and exhibit differentiation defects. Currently, the efficacy of iron supplementation is monitored by measuring indices of erythroid hemoglobinization. However, its effect on erythroid differentiation is less clear. In this study, we used zebrafish with genetic iron metabolism defects to determine if iron supplementation could rescue erythropoietic defects in organisms that are iron deficient at the cellular and systemic level. To carry out this study, we developed a technique to sort Tg(globin lcr:EGFP) erythrocytes from single zebrafish embryos onto slides for imaging. We found that iron supplementation in mfrn1 mutant zebrafish, which carry a defect in mitochondrial iron trafficking, restored hemoglobinization but not erythroid cell number or terminal differentiation. Iron supplementation in fpn1 mutant zebrafish, which have defects in export of iron from yolk syncytial cells and intestinal epithelium, functioning a model of dietary iron deficiency, restored erythroid cell number but not terminal differentiation deficiencies. Our data suggests that in addition to adequate iron levels, correct regulation of iron trafficking is required for optimal erythroid iron utilization and terminal erythropoiesis.",

A variety of proteolytic enzymes derived from the coagulation cascade and inflammatory milieu activate PARs, however specific activators in different physiological and pathophysiological contexts remain poorly defined. PARs are highly expressed in many cancer cells and regulate various aspects of tumor growth and metastasis. Endogenous proteinases that regulate PARs in the setting of various tumors however remains unresolved. Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a major cause of mortality in men despite advances in early detection and clinical intervention. PAR expression has been reported in PCa, however, their role here remains poorly defined. In androgen independent PC3 cells, we find functional expression of PAR1 and PAR2 but not PAR4. Using genetically encoded PAR cleavage biosensors, we find that PCa cells secrete proteolytic enzymes that cleave PARs and trigger autocrine signaling. Deletion of PAR1 and PAR2 using CRISPR/Cas9 combined with microarray analysis revealed genes that are differentially regulated by this autocrine signalling mechanism. Interestingly, several genes that are known PCa prognostic factors or biomarker were differentially expressed in PAR1-KO and PAR2-KO PC3 cells. We also examined PAR1 and PAR2 regulation of PCa cell proliferation and migration using PAR1 and PAR2-KO PC3 cells, as well as PAR1 and PAR2 specific agonists and antagonists. We find that PAR1 and PAR2 have opposite effects on PC3 cell proliferation and migration. In summary, we have identified an autocrine signaling mechanism through PARs as a regulator of PCa cell function.",

    "abstract": "Belemnites are an extinct group of Mesozoic coleoid cephalopods, common in Jurassic and Cretaceous marine sedimentary rocks. Despite their significance, their total group phylogeny has rarely been considered in recent decades. In contrast, most researchers restricted the assignment of families to one of the two usually recognized subgroups, the Belemnitina and the Belemnopseina. As for many fossil cephalopods, researchers have been reluctant to employ modern phylogenetic methods to illuminate belemnites evolutionary history.\n\nTo overcome the \"dead end\" of belemnite systematics, we performed the first tip-dated Bayesian analysis of belemnite phylogeny. In our analysis, the Aulacoceratida are found as the monophyletic sister group to belemnites. The Sinobelemnitidae are resolved as paraphyletic and fall outside the Belemnitina and Belemnopseina, which make up the remaining belemnites. Belemnitina is restricted to Jurassic species with generally no or apical furrows. Holcobelidae are the earliest branching Belemnopseina. Cylindroteuthids sensu lato (including Oxyteuthidae) are nested within Belemnopseina, contrary to the common hypothesis placing them within the Belemnitina. Duvaliidae and Dicoelitidae are recovered as members of the Belemnopseina, but their precise relationship has to be evaluated based on more taxa and additional characters. We introduce the well-supported unranked clade Pseudoalveolata, which includes Dimitobelidae, Belemnitellidae, and members of the paraphyletic \"Belemnopseidae\".\n\nThe phylogeny presented here, based on reproducible and quantitative methods, contrasts with the usually applied authoritative \"stratophenetic\" approach to belemnite systematics, based on the overemphasis of single characters. This result is considered the basis for future studies on belemnite phylogeny, allowing for a rigorous testing of evolutionary hypotheses.\n\nPLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYBelemnites were common extinct cephalopods that were closely related to todays squid and cuttlefish. The most common fossil remains of belemnites are bullet-shaped calcitic \"cones\" (rostrum) that cover their internal shells. Belemnites evolutionary history is not well known. Our study revealed an evolutionary tree of belemnites based on the statistical analysis of morphological features of the rostrum and calibrated to the known geological ages of the studied belemnite species. This approach was for the first time applied to belemnites and changed several aspects that were believed about their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Movement perception involves both motion and form processing. Previous research has shown that processing along the motion pathway requires a familiar but not necessarily a human shape. However, the role of objecthood and animacy in the form pathway is less clear. Here, we used EEG frequency tagging to study how objecthood and animacy influence both posture processing and the integration of postures into movements. Specifically, we measured brain responses to repeating sequences of well-defined or pixelated images (objecthood) of human or corkscrew agents (animacy) performing fluent or non-fluent movements (movement fluency). The results revealed that movement processing was sensitive to objecthood but not to animacy, whereas posture processing was sensitive to both. Thus, our results indicate that movement processing in the form pathway requires a familiar shape, but not necessarily a human shape. Instead, stimulus animacy appears to be relevant only for posture processing.",

    "abstract": "Frog virus 3 (FV3, genera Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae), a double-stranded DNA virus, results in irreparable damage to biodiversity and significant economic losses to aquaculture. Although the existing FV3 detection methods are of high sensitivity and specificity, the complex procedure and requirement of expensive instruments limit their practical implantation. Herein, we develop a fast, easy-to-implement, highly sensitive, and point-of-care (POC) detection system for FV3. Combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and CRISPR/Cas12a, we achieve a limit of detection (LoD) of 100 aM (60.2 copies/L) by optimizing RPA primers and CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs). For POC detection, we build a smartphone microscopy (SPM) and achieve an LoD of 10 aM within 40 minutes. Four positive animal-derived samples with a quantitation cycle (Cq) value of quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the range of 13 to 32 are detectable by the proposed system. In addition, we deploy deep learning models for binary classification (positive or negative samples) and multiclass classification (different concentrations of FV3 and negative samples), achieving 100% and 98.75% accuracy, respectively. Without temperature regulation and expensive equipment, RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a combined with a smartphone readout and artificial intelligence (AI) assisted classification shows great potential for FV3 detection. This integrated system holds great promise for POC detection of aquatic DNA pathogens.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAn integrated DNA detection system is developed by combining RPA, CRISPR/Cas12a, smartphone microscopy, and deep learning.\nC_LIO_LIThe LoD of frog virus 3 is 10 aM within 40 min.\nC_LIO_LIThe detection system shows good performance on animal-derived samples.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In modeling species distributions and population dynamics, spatially-interpolated climatic data are often used as proxies for real, on-the-ground measurements. For shallow freshwater systems, this practice may be problematic as interpolations used for surface waters are generated from terrestrial sensor networks measuring air temperatures. Using these may therefore bias statistical estimates of species environmental tolerances or population projections - particularly among pleustonic and epilimnetic organisms. Using a global database of millions of daily satellite-derived lake surface water temperatures (LSWT), I trained machine learning models to correct for the correspondence between air and LSWT as a function of atmospheric and topographic predictors, resulting in the creation of monthly high-resolution global maps of air-LSWT offsets, corresponding uncertainty measures, and derived LSWT-based bioclimatic layers for use by the scientific community. I then compared the performance of these LSWT layers and air temperature-based layers in population dynamic and ecological niche models (ENM). While generally high, the correspondence between air temperature and LSWT was quite variable and often nonlinear depending on the spatial context. These LSWT predictions were better able to capture the modeled population dynamics and geographic distributions of two common aquatic plant species. Further, ENM models trained with LSWT predictors more accurately captured lab-measured thermal response curves. I conclude that these predicted LSWT temperatures perform better than raw air temperatures when used for population projections and environmental niche modeling, and should be used by practitioners to derive more biologically-meaningful results. These global LSWT predictions and corresponding error estimates and bioclimatic layers have been made freely available to all researchers in a permanent archive.",

    "abstract": "Evolution is a function of mutagenesis and selection. To analyse the role of mutagenesis on the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we reconstructed the mutational spectrum, which was highly C>U and G>U biased. This bias forces the SARS-CoV-2 genome to become increasingly U-rich unless selection cancels it. We analysed the consequences of this bias on the composition of the most neutral (four-fold degenerate synonymous substitutions) and the least neutral positions (nonsynonymous substitutions). The neutral nucleotide composition is already highly saturated by U and, according to our model, it is at equilibrium, suggesting that in the future, we dont expect any more increase in U. However, nonsynonymous changes continue slowly evolve towards equilibrium substituting CG-rich amino-acids (\"losers\") with U-rich ones (\"gainers\"). This process is universal for all genes of SARS-CoV-2 as well as for other coronaviridae species. In line with the direction mutation pressure hypothesis, we show that viral-specific amino acid content is associated with the viral-specific mutational spectrum due to the accumulation of effectively neutral slightly deleterious variants (losers to gainers) during the molecular evolution. The tuning of a protein space by the mutational process is expected to be typical for species with relaxed purifying selection, suggesting that the purging of slightly-deleterious variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population is not very effective, probably due to the fast expansion of the viral population during the pandemic. Understanding the mutational process can help to design more robust vaccines, based on gainer-rich motifs, close to the mutation-selection equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we report selection of albumin-binding macrocyclic peptides from genetically encoded libraries of peptides modified by perfluoroaryl-cysteine SNAr chemistry. Modification of phage-displayed libraries SXCXnC-phage, n=3-5, where X is any amino acid except for cysteine by decafluoro-diphenylsulfone (DFS), yields genetically-encoded library of octafluoro-diphen-ylsulfone-crosslinked macrocycles (OFS-SXCXnC-phage). Selection from these libraries using albumin as a bait identified a family of significantly enriched perfluoroaryl-macrocycles. Synthesis of perfluoroaryl-macrocycles predicted by phage display and testing their binding properties by 19F NMR and fluorescent polarization identified OFS-macrocycle with SICRFFC sequence as the most potent albumin binder. We observed that OFS-macrocycles slowly react with biological nucleophiles such as glutathione. Replacing decafluoro-diphenylsulfone by nearly isosteric pentafluorophenyl sulfide yielded perfluorophenylsulfide (PFS)-crosslinked macrocycles devoid of undesired reactivity. The augmented lead PFS-macrocycle with SICRFFC sequence exhibited KD = 4-6 M towards human serum albumin and similar affinities towards rat and mouse albumins. When injected in mouse, the PFS-SICRFFCGGG compound was significantly retained in circulation in vivo when compared to control PFS-macrocyclic peptide. The perfluoroaryl-macrocycles with SICRFFC motif are the smallest known peptide macrocycle with significant affinity for human albumin and they are a productive starting point for future development of compact macrocycles with predictable circulation half-life in vivo.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=67 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/504611v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cd54d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7bd9aborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f7515org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cfc49a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Protein-lipid interactions constitute a very important class of biological interactions critical for multiple cell and tissue functions. It is believed that most lipid-protein interactions are very weak, with affinities in the 1mM-1M range. Here we study the interactions of multiple protein lipid binding domains with lipid membranes containing signaling lipids known as phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) using a new mechanically transduced immunosorbent assay (METRIS). We demonstrate that this assay can measure extremely weak interactions at PIP bilayer concentrations below 1%, which is close to the biological lipid concentration regime. In particular, we have studied the interaction of DrrAWT, DrrAK568A, PH-{delta}, and 2XFYVE as well as previously unexplored lipid binding domains such as Auxilin 1 (PTEN) and Auxilin 2 (GAK) against a wide palette of PIPs. Our results confirm that each of these domains interacts specifically with a PIP partner. In the case of Auxilin 1 and Auxilin 2, both proteins in the Clathrin endocytotic pathway, we find that their PTEN-like domain interacts specifically yet with ultra low affinity with PI3P and PI4P respectively. We have also found a new unknown medium-high affinity interaction between GAK with PI34P2. Our work, thus, provides a direct and robust method to measure and catalog protein lipid interactions which are important in many processes such as signaling and membrane sculpting. Furthermore, this assay can be extended in a straightforward manner to study other interactions such as ligand-receptor or antibody-antigen.",

    "abstract": "The activities of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes and Gasdermin D (GsdmD), the final executor of inflammasome activity, are implicated in lung cancer pathophysiology but its not clear if their contributions promote or retard lung cancer progression. GsdmD plays a role in release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1 {beta}), and the CANTOS trial and recent studies have highlighted a crucial role of IL-1{beta} in promoting lung cancer. Expression of GsdmD was shown to be upregulated in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue, but its contribution to in vivo lung cancer metastasis is not known. Using a metastatic Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cell model, we show that GsdmD knockout (GsdmD-/-) mice form significantly fewer cancer foci in lung, and exhibit markedly decreased lung cancer metastasis. Furthermore, GsdmD-/- mice show a significant ~ 50% increase in median survival rate vs. isogenic WT C57BL6J mice. The cleaved forms of GsdmD and IL-1 {beta} were detected in lung tumor tissue, indicating inflammasome activity in lung tumor microenvironment (TME). Increased migration and growth of LLC cells was observed upon exposure to the conditioned media derived from inflammasome-induced wild type, but not the GsdmD-/-, macrophages. Exposure of human A549 lung cancer cells to the conditioned media derived from inflammasome-induced THP-1 macrophages also resulted in increased cell migration. Using bone marrow transplantation, we show the myeloid-specific contribution of GsdmD in lung cancer metastasis. Taken together, our data show that inflammasome activation in macrophages promotes lung cancer growth and migration, and GsdmD plays a myeloid-specific role in lung cancer progression in mice.",

Development of stemphylium blight resistant cultivars by introgression of resistance alleles from crop wild relatives of lentil, such as Lens ervoides, is one strategy of disease control. The objective of this study was to identify genomic regions associated with stemphylium blight resistance by combining linkage mapping and marker-trait association analysis. A total of 182 genotypes of a lentil advanced backcross population (LABC-01) developed from the backcross of the interspecific L. culinaris x L. ervoides line LR-59-81 (donor) and cultivar CDC Redberry (recurrent) and 101 diverse lentil accessions selected by stratified random sampling from a lentil diversity panel were genotyped and evaluated for stemphylium blight reactions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified four loci contributing to stemphylium blight resistance on lentil chromosomes 2, 4 and 5. Marker trait association analysis detected five significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with stemphylium blight resistance within QTLs regions and seven SNP markers outside the QTLs regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. The markers associated with stemphylium blight resistance may be useful for marker-assisted selection of resistant cultivars after validation.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral asymmetry is critical for typical brain function and development, at the same time altered brain lateralization seems to be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. In autism spectrum disorders (ASD) studies have suggested reduced functional and structural cerebral asymmetry, reporting changes in asymmetric activation of brain structures involved in language and social processing, and increased prevalence of left-handedness. Zebrafish are increasingly emerging as model species to study brain lateralization, using asymmetric development of the habenula, a phylogenetically old brain structure associated with social and emotional processing, to investigate the relationship between brain asymmetry and social behavior. We exposed 5-hour post-fertilization zebrafish embryos to valproic acid (VPA), a compound used to model the core signs of ASD in many vertebrate species, and assessed social interaction, visual lateralization and gene expression in the thalamus and the telencephalon. VPA-exposed zebrafish exhibit social deficits and a deconstruction of social visual laterality to the mirror. We also observe changes in the asymmetric expression of the epithalamic marker leftover and in telencephalic gene expression in adult zebrafish. Our data indicate that VPA exposure neutralizes the animals visual field bias, with a complete loss of the left-eye use bias in front of their own mirror image, and alters brain asymmetric gene expression, opening new perspectives to investigate brain lateralization and its link to atypical social cognitive development, considering zebrafish as an animal model for the autistic syndrome.",

Importantly, the 3 anti-tag region of NTR and CTR bind at two distinct channels in the Craspase, and CTR with a non-complementary 3 anti-tag induces a marked conformational change of the TPR-CHAT, which allosterically activates its protease activity to cleave an ancillary protein Csx30. This cleavage then triggers an abortive infection as the antiviral strategy of the type III-E system.

Using the calcaneus as a phenotypic marker through qualitative and quantitative 3D microanatomical analyses, we relied on a comparative study across wild boars (Sus scrofa) populations from controlled experimental conditions with different mobility patterns (natural habitat, large pen, and stall) and archaeological specimens collected from middle and late Mesolithic as surrogate for the norm of reaction in European wild boar phenotype before the spread of agriculture and domestic pigs. Results provide evidence for compressive and tensile forces as the main elements affecting the variation in the cortical thickness along the calcaneus. Furthermore, changes in the internal structure of the calcaneus between mobility patterns are observed but their intensity is not directly associated with the degree of mobility restriction and only weakly impacted by the size or weight of the individuals. Despite having greater bone volume, the calcaneus of the Mesolithic wild boars displays a very similar microanatomy compared to the present-day hunted or captive wild boars. These results suggest that calcaneal microanatomy is more affected by population differences than by locomotor variation. For all these reasons, this preliminary study doesnt support the use of microanatomy of the calcaneus as an indicator of change in locomotor behaviour induced by captivity in the archaeological record.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian species harbor compositionally distinct gut microbial communities, but the mechanisms that maintain specificity of symbionts to host species remain unclear. Here we show that natural selection within house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) drives deterministic assembly of the house-mouse gut microbiota from mixtures of native and non-native microbiotas. Competing microbiotas from wild-derived lines of house mice and other mouse species (Mus and Peromyscus spp.) within germ-free wildtype (WT) and Rag1-knockout (Rag1-/-) house mice revealed widespread fitness advantages for native gut bacteria. Certain native Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes favored by selection in WT hosts were not favored or disfavored in Rag1-/- hosts, which lack adaptive immunity, indicating that Rag1 mediates fitness advantages of these strains. This study demonstrates local adaptation of gut microbiota to a mammalian species.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAdaptive advantages for native bacteria underlie the assembly of the mouse gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, affecting approximately one million individuals in the USA alone. A significant proportion of risk for Parkinsons disease is driven by genetics. Despite this, the majority of the common genetic variation that contributes to disease risk is unknown, in-part because previous genetic studies have focussed solely on the contribution of single nucleotide variants. Structural variants represent a significant source of genetic variation in the human genome. However, because assay of this variability is challenging, structural variants have not been cataloged on a genome-wide scale, and their contribution to the risk of Parkinsons disease remains unknown. In this study, we 1) leveraged the GATK-SV pipeline to detect and genotype structural variants in 7,772 short-read sequencing data and 2) generated a subset of matched whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing data from the PPMI cohort to allow for comprehensive structural variant confirmation. We detected, genotyped, and tested 3,154 \"high-confidence\" common structural variant loci, representing over 412 million nucleotides of non-reference genetic variation. Using the long-read sequencing data, we validated three structural variants that may drive the association signals at known Parkinsons disease risk loci, including a 2kb intronic deletion within the gene LRRN4. Further, we confirm that the majority of structural variants in the human genome cannot be detected using short-read sequencing alone, encompassing on average around 4 million nucleotides of inaccessible sequence per genome. Therefore, although these data provide the most comprehensive survey of the contribution of structural variants to the genetic risk of Parkinsons disease to date, this study highlights the need for large-scale long-read datasets to fully elucidate the role of structural variants in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "1.Forensic genetic genealogy (FGG) has primarily relied upon dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles from forensic samples or unidentified human remains queried against online genealogy database(s) of known profiles generated with SNP microarrays or from whole genome sequencing (WGS). In these queries, SNPs are compared to database samples by locating contiguous stretches of shared SNP alleles that allow for detection of genomic segments that are identical by descent (IBD) among biological relatives (kinship). This segment-based approach, while robust for detecting distant relationships, generally requires DNA quantity and/or quality that are sometimes not available in forensic casework samples. By focusing on SNPs with maximal discriminatory power and using an algorithm designed for a sparser SNP set than those from microarray typing, performance similar to segment matching was reached even in difficult casework samples. This algorithm locates shared segments using kinship coefficients in \"windows\" across the genome. The windowed kinship algorithm is a modification of the PC-AiR and PC-Relate tools for genetic relatedness inference, referred to here as the \"whole genome kinship\" approach, that control for the presence of unknown or unspecified population substructure. Simulated and empirical data in this study, using DNA profiles comprised of 10,230 SNPs (10K multiplex) targeted by the ForenSeq Kintelligence Kit demonstrate that the windowed kinship approach performs comparably to segment matching for identifying first, second and third degree relationships, reasonably well for fourth degree relationships, and with fewer false kinship associations. Selection criteria for the 10K SNP PCR-based multiplex and functionality of the windowed kinship algorithm are described.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cultivated fish offers the potential for a more ethical, sustainable, and safe seafood system. However, fish cell culture is relatively understudied in comparison to mammalian cells. Here, we established and characterized a continuous Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) skeletal muscle cell line (\"Mack\" cells). The cells were isolated from muscle biopsies of fresh-caught fish, with separate isolations performed from two distinct fish. Mack1 cells (cells from the first isolation) were cultured for over a year and subcultured over 130 times. The cells proliferated at initial doubling times of 63.9 hr ({+/-} 19.1 SD). After a spontaneous immortalization crisis from passages 37-43, the cells proliferated at doubling times of 24.3 hr ({+/-} 4.91 SD). A muscle phenotype was confirmed through characterization of muscle stemness and differentiation via paired-box protein 7 (PAX7) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunostaining, respectively. An adipocyte-like phenotype was also demonstrated for the cells through lipid accumulation, confirmed via Oil Red O (ORO) staining and quantification of neutral lipids. New qPCR primers (HPRT, PAX3B, MYOD1, MYOG, TNNT3A, and PPARG) were tailored to the mackerel genome and used to characterize mackerel cell genotypes. This work provides the first spontaneously immortalized fish muscle cell line for research, ideally serving as a reference for subsequent investigation.",

    "abstract": "The study of viral communities has revealed the enormous diversity and impact these biological entities have on a range of different ecosystems. These observations have sparked widespread interest in developing computational strategies that support the comprehensive characterization of viral communities based on sequencing data. Here we introduce VIRify, a new computational pipeline designed to provide a user-friendly and accurate functional and taxonomic characterization of viral communities. VIRify identifies viral contigs and prophages from metagenomic assemblies and annotates them using a collection of viral profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). These include our manually-curated profile HMMs, which serve as specific taxonomic markers for a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viral taxa and are thus used to reliably classify viral contigs. We tested VIRify on assemblies from two microbial mock communities and a large metagenomics study. The results showed that VIRify was able to identify sequences from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, and provided taxonomic classifications from the genus to the family rank with an accuracy of at least 95.5%. In addition, VIRify allowed the detection and taxonomic classification of a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses present in 243 marine metagenomic assemblies. Overall, we demonstrate that VIRify is a novel and powerful resource that offers an enhanced capability to detect a broad range of viral contigs and taxonomically classify them.",

    "abstract": "Metal ions are essential cofactors for many proteins. In fact, currently, about half of the structurally characterized proteins contain a metal ion. Metal ions play a crucial role for many applications such as enzyme design or design of protein-protein interactions because they are biologically abundant, tether to the protein using strong interactions, and have favorable catalytic properties e.g. as Lewis acid. Computational design of metalloproteins is however hampered by the complex electronic structure of many biologically relevant metals such as zinc that can often not be accurately described using a classical force field. In this work, we develop two tools - Metal3D (based on 3D convolutional neural networks) and Metal1D (solely based on geometric criteria) to improve the identification and localization of zinc and other metal ions in experimental and computationally predicted protein structures. Comparison with other currently available tools shows that Metal3D is the most accurate metal ion location predictor to date outperforming geometric predictors including Metal1D by a wide margin using a single structure as input. Metal3D outputs a confidence metric for each predicted site and works on proteins with few homologes in the protein data bank. The predicted metal ion locations for Metal3D are within 0.70 {+/-} 0.64 [A] of the experimental locations with half of the sites below 0.5 [A]. Metal3D predicts a global metal density that can be used for annotation of structures predicted using e.g. AlphaFold2 and a per residue metal density that can be used in protein design workflows for the location of suitable metal binding sites and rotamer sampling to create novel metalloproteins. Metal3D is available as easy to use webapp, notebook or commandline interface.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLyme neuroborreliosis, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS, PNS). The CNS manifestations, especially at later stages, can mimic/cause many other neurological conditions including psychiatric disorders, dementia, and others, with a likely neuroinflammatory basis. The pathogenic mechanisms associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis, however, are not fully understood.\n\nMethodsIn this study, using cultures of primary rhesus microglia, we explored the roles of several fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in neuroinflammation associated with live B. burgdorferi exposure. FGFR specific siRNA and inhibitors, custom antibody arrays, ELISAs, immunofluorescence and microscopy were used to comprehensively analyze the roles of these molecules in microglial neuroinflammation due to B. burgdorferi.\n\nResultsFGFR1- 3 expressions were upregulated in microglia in response to B. burgdorferi. Inhibition of FGFR 1, 2 and 3 signaling using siRNA and three different inhibitors showed that FGFR signaling is proinflammatory in response to the Lyme disease bacterium. FGFR1 activation also contributed to non-viable B. burgdorferi mediated neuroinflammation. Analysis of the B. burgdorferi conditioned microglial medium by a custom antibody array showed that several FGFs are induced by the live bacterium including FGF6, FGF10 and FGF12, which in turn induce IL-6 and/or IL-8 in a dose dependent manner, indicating a proinflammatory nature. To our knowledge, this is also the first-ever described role for FGF6 and FGF12 in CNS neuroinflammation. FGF23 upregulation, in addition, was observed in response to the Lyme disease bacterium. B. burgdorferi exposure also downregulated many FGFs including FGF 5,7, 9, 11,13, 16, 20 and 21. Some of the upregulated FGFs have been implicated in major depressive disorder or dementia development, while the downregulated ones have been demonstrated to have protective roles in epilepsy, Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, spinal cord injury, blood-brain barrier stability, and others.\n\nConclusionsIn this study we show that FGFRs and FGFs are novel mediators of inflammatory pathogenesis in Lyme neuroborreliosis. It is likely that an unresolved, long-term (neuro)-Lyme infection can contribute to the development of other neurologic conditions in susceptible individuals either by augmenting pathogenic FGFs or by suppressing ameliorative FGFs or both.",

Nups have also been observed in cytoplasmic foci proposed to function as pore pre-assembly intermediates. Here we characterize the composition and incidence of cytoplasmic Nup foci in an intact animal, C. elegans. We find that, in young non-stressed animals, Nup foci only appear in developing sperm, oocytes, and embryos, tissues that express high Nup levels. The foci are condensates of highly cohesive FG-Nups that are maintained near their solubility limit in the cytoplasm by posttranslational modifications and chaperone activity. Only a minor fraction of FG-Nup molecules concentrate in Nup foci, which dissolve during M phase and are dispensable for nuclear pore assembly. Nup condensation is enhanced by stress and advancing age, and overexpression of a single FG-Nup in post-mitotic neurons is sufficient to induce ectopic condensation and organismal paralysis. Our results suggest that Nup foci are non-essential, \"accidental\", and potentially toxic condensates whose assembly is actively suppressed in healthy cells.",

Here, we perform time-lapse imaging in the visual cortex of Nex-Cre;SUN1-GFP mice. Nuclear infolding was observed within 15 minutes of stimulation in young nuclei, while the aged nuclei were already infolded pre-stimulation and showed reduced dynamics of the morphology. In young nuclei, the depletion of the stimuli restored the nucleus to a spherical shape and reduced the dynamic behavior, suggesting that nuclear infolding is a reversible process. We also found the aged nucleus to be stiffer than the young one, further relating to the age-associated loss of nuclear shape dynamics. We reveal temporal changes in the nuclear shape upon external stimulation and observe that these morphological dynamics decrease with age.",

    "abstract": "Although the biological utilities of endogenous RNAi (endo-RNAi) have been largely elusive, recent studies reveal its critical role in the non-model fruitfly Drosophila simulans to suppress selfish genes, whose unchecked activities can severely impair spermatogenesis. In particular, hairpin RNA (hpRNA) loci generate endo-siRNAs that suppress evolutionary novel, X-linked, meiotic drive loci. The consequences of deleting even a single hpRNA (Nmy) in males are profound, as such individuals are nearly incapable of siring male progeny. Here, comparative genomic analyses of D. simulans and D. melanogaster mutants of the core RNAi factor dcr-2 reveal a substantially expanded network of recently-emerged hpRNA-target interactions in the former species. The de novo hpRNA regulatory network in D. simulans bears compelling signatures of sex chromosome conflict and provides insight into molecular strategies that underlie hpRNA emergence. In particular, our data support the existence of ongoing rapid evolution of Nmy/Dox-related networks, recurrent targeting of testis HMG Box loci by hpRNAs, and connections to the piRNA pathway. Importantly, the impact of the endo-RNAi network on gene expression flips the convention for regulatory networks, since we observe strong derepression of targets of the youngest hpRNAs, but only mild effects on the targets of the oldest hpRNAs. These data suggest that endo-RNAi are especially critical during incipient stages of intrinsic sex chromosome conflicts, and that continual cycles of distortion and resolution may contribute to the segregation of species.",

This species is also grown in Northern Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and East to Southeast Asia. To capture the genomic diversity of domesticates of this important legume, de novo genome assemblies were produced for representatives of six sub-populations of cultivated cowpea identified previously from genotyping of several hundred diverse accessions. In the most complete assembly (IT97K-499-35), 26,026 core and 4,963 noncore genes were identified, with 35,436 pan genes when considering all seven accessions. GO-terms associated with response to stress and defense response were highly enriched among the noncore genes, while core genes were enriched in terms related to transcription factor activity, and transport and metabolic processes. Over 5 million SNPs relative to each assembly and over 40 structural variants >1 Mb in size were identified by comparing genomes. Vu10 was the chromosome with the highest frequency of SNPs, and Vu04 had the most structural variants. Noncore genes harbor a larger proportion of potentially disruptive variants than core genes, including missense, stop gain, and frameshift mutations; this suggests that noncore genes substantially contribute to diversity within domesticated cowpea.\n\nArticle SummaryThis study reports annotated genome assemblies of six cowpea accessions. Together with the previously reported annotated genome of IT97K-499-35, these constitute a pan-genome resource representing six subpopulations of domesticated cowpea. Annotations include genes, variant calls for SNPs and short indels, larger presence or absence variants, and inversions.

Here we examine female house mouse preferences toward male odors across the reproductive states of estrus and late-stage pregnancy. In house mice, urine scent marks are salient social odors that convey information about the sex and identity of individuals by major urinary proteins (MUPs). Males secrete a sex-specific pheromonal protein called darcin (MUP20). Additionally, genetically diverse mice secrete unique combinations of MUPs used in individual recognition. Prior work has revealed that male odors are powerful social stimuli for female mice, yet we have a limited understanding of how the valence of such odors change across reproductive states. We discovered a valence shift among estrus and pregnant females toward novel male urine, in which estrus females exhibit preference and pregnant females show strong avoidance. This valence switch also occurs toward darcin alone, providing further support for darcin as a strong sexual signal. However, when presented with familiar male urine, the approach-avoidance response disappears, even when additional darcin is added. In contrast, when an existing identity protein (MUP11) is added to familiar male urine the approach-avoidance response is recovered. This indicates that darcin in the absence of other identity information denotes a novel male and that familiar identity information present in male urine is sufficient to modify responses to darcin. Our findings suggest that the sex and identity information encoded by MUPs are likely processed via distinct, and potentially opposing pathways, that modulate responses toward complex social odor blends. Furthermore, we identify a state-modulated shift in decision-making toward social odors and propose a neural circuit model for this flow of information. These data underscore the importance of physiological state and signal context for interpreting the meaning and importance of social odors.",

    "abstract": "It has long been recognized that certain cancer types afflict female and male patients disproportionately. The reasons for this disparity include differences in male/female physiology, effect of sex hormones, risk behavior and environmental exposures, and different copy number of the sex chromosomes X and Y. Loss of Y (LOY) is common in peripheral blood cells in aging men, and this phenomenon is associated with several diseases. However, the frequency and role of LOY in tumors is little understood. Here, we present a comprehensive catalog of LOY in >5,000 primary tumors from male patients in the TCGA. We show that LOY rates vary by tumor type, and provide evidence for LOY being either a passenger or driver event depending on context. LOY in uveal melanoma specifically is associated with age, survival and is an independent predictor of poor outcome. LOY creates common dependencies on DDX3X and EIF1AX in male cell lines, suggesting that LOY generates unique vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ has been regarded as an effective antioxidant agent against cryo-induced oxidative cellular damage. This study aimed to evaluate the use of different doses of MitoQ combined with trehalose to minimize mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress during sperm cryopreservation of Markhoz goat. For this, semen collection was performed every 5 days from 5 bucks (10 ejaculates per buck). The ejaculates were pooled and then diluted in eight different Tris-based extenders as follows: no additives (control), 20, 200, 2000 nM of MitoQ (MT20, MT200, MT 2000, respectively), 150 mM of trehalose (Tr), MT20+Tr, MT200+Tr, MT2000+Tr. Each semen sample was frozen using a standard protocol, and sperm function and antioxidative status were evaluated after thawing. Results indicated higher total and progressive motility, acrosome and membrane integrity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity, and lower DNA fragmentation and malondialdehyde in MT200+Tr than for all other groups except MT200; meanwhile, MT200 was also greater in these parameters than in the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MT200 and MT200+Tr showed higher (P < 0.05) percentages of live cryopreserved sperm with high membrane mitochondrial potential than other groups. However, abnormality percentage and catalase activity of frozen-thawed sperm were not affected by treatments (P > 0.05). To conclude, we have found that supplementation of 200 nM MitoQ alone or in combination with 150 mM trehalose to semen extender improves the quality of cryopreserved sperm in goats, which is associated with enhanced antioxidant enzymatic defense and mitochondrial activity and reduced DNA fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory interneurons regulate the activity of cortical circuitry, and their dysfunction has been implicated in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 16p11.2 microdeletions are genetically linked to 1% of ASD. However, there have been few studies of the effects of this microdeletion on interneuron development. Using ventral telencephalic organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, we investigated the effect of this microdeletion on organoid size, progenitor proliferation and organisation into neural rosettes, ganglionic eminence (GE) marker expression at early developmental timepoints and expression of the neuronal marker, NEUN at later stages. Early deletion organoids exhibited significantly greater variations in size with concomitant increases in relative neural rosette area and the expression of the ventral telencephalic marker, COUPTFII, with significantly increased variability in these properties. Cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in total cell cycle length caused primarily by an elongated G1-phase, the duration of which also varied significantly more than normal. Late deletion organoids increased their expression of the neuronal marker NEUN. We propose that 16p11.2 microdeletions increase developmental variability and may contribute to ASD aetiology by lengthening the cell cycle of ventral progenitors, promoting premature differentiation into interneurons.\n\nSummary StatementUsing 3D-region-specific organoids, we demonstrate that 16p11.2 deletion increases variability and prolongs the cell cycle of human subpallial progenitors by lengthening their G1 phase.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional networks governing cardiac precursor cell (CPC) specification are incompletely understood due in part to limitations in distinguishing CPCs from non-cardiac mesoderm in early gastrulation. We leveraged detection of early cardiac lineage transgenes within a granular single cell transcriptomic time course of mouse embryos to identify emerging CPCs and describe their transcriptional profiles. Mesp1, a transiently-expressed mesodermal transcription factor (TF), is canonically described as an early regulator of cardiac specification. However, we observed perdurance of CPC transgene-expressing cells in Mesp1 mutants, albeit mis-localized, prompting us to investigate the scope of Mesp1s role in CPC emergence and differentiation. Mesp1 mutant CPCs failed to robustly activate markers of cardiomyocyte maturity and critical cardiac TFs, yet they exhibited transcriptional profiles resembling cardiac mesoderm progressing towards cardiomyocyte fates. Single cell chromatin accessibility analysis defined a Mesp1-dependent developmental breakpoint in cardiac lineage progression at a shift from mesendoderm transcriptional networks to those necessary for cardiac patterning and morphogenesis. These results reveal Mesp1-independent aspects of early CPC specification and underscore a Mesp1-dependent regulatory landscape required for progression through cardiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "We often assume that travel direction is redundant with head direction, but from first principles these two factors provide differing spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a fundamental component of human navigation, it is unclear how self-motion signals for travel direction contribute to forming a travel trajectory. Employing a novel motion adaptation paradigm from visual neuroscience designed to preclude a contribution of head direction, we found high-level aftereffects of perceived travel direction, indicating that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, we discovered a higher frequency of reporting perceived travel toward the adapted direction compared to a no-adapt control - an aftereffect that runs contrary to low-level motion aftereffects. This travel aftereffect was maintained after controlling for possible response biases and approaching effects, and it scaled with adaptation duration. These findings demonstrate the first evidence of how a pure travel direction signal might be represented in humans, independent of head direction.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods have been used for over a decade for staging and subtyping a variety of brain diseases, offering fast and objective methods to classify neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also been used to infer dementia severity and predict future clinical decline. Most CNN-based deep learning models use T1-weighted brain MRI scans to identify predictive features for these tasks. In contrast, we examine the added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) - a variant of MRI, sensitive to microstructural tissue properties - as an additional input in CNN-based models of dementia severity. dMRI is sensitive to microstructural brain abnormalities not evident on standard anatomical MRI. By training CNNs on combined anatomical and diffusion MRI, we hypothesize that we could boost performance when predicting widely-used clinical assessments of dementia severity, such as individuals scores on the ADAS11, ADAS13, and MMSE (mini-mental state exam) clinical scales. For benchmarking, we evaluate CNNs that use T1-weighted MRI and dMRI to estimate \"brain age\" - the task of predicting a persons chronological age from their neuroimaging data. To assess which dMRI-derived maps were most beneficial, we computed DWI-derived diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) maps of mean and radial diffusivity (MD/RD), axial diffusivity (AD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) for 1198 elderly subjects (age: 74.35 +/- 7.74 yrs.; 600 F/598 M, with a distribution of 636 CN/421 MCI/141 AD) from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We tested both 2D Slice CNN and 3D CNN neural network models for the above predictive tasks. Our results suggest that for at least some deep learning architectures, diffusion-weighted MRI may enhance performance for several AD-relevant deep learning tasks relative to using T1-weighted images alone.",
