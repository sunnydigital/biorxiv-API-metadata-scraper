    "abstract": "Identifying neoepitopes that elicit an adaptive immune response is a major bottleneck to developing personalized cancer vaccines. Experimental validation of candidate neoepitopes is extremely resource intensive, and the vast majority of candidates are non-immunogenic, making their identification a needle-in-a-haystack problem. To address this challenge, we present computational methods for predicting MHC-I epitopes and identifying immunogenic neoepitopes with improved precision. The BigMHC method comprises an ensemble of seven pan-allelic deep neural networks trained on peptide-MHC eluted ligand data from mass spectrometry assays and transfer learned on data from assays of antigen-specific immune response. Compared with four state-of-the-art classifiers, BigMHC significantly improves the prediction of epitope presentation on a test set of 45,409 MHC ligands among 900,592 random negatives (AUROC=0.9733, AUPRC=0.8779). After transfer learning on immunogenicity data, BigMHC yields significantly higher precision than seven state-of-the-art models in identifying immunogenic neoepitopes, making BigMHC effective in clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Cyclic immunohistochemistry (cycIHC) uses sequential rounds of colorimetric immunostaining and imaging for quantitative mapping of location and number of cells of interest. In addition, cycIHC benefits from the speed and simplicity of brightfield microscopy for data collection, making the collection of entire tissue sections and slides possible at a trivial cost compared to other high dimensional imaging modalities. However, large cycIHC datasets (greater than 50 GB) currently require an expert data scientist to concatenate separate open-source tools for each step of image pre-processing, registration, and segmentation, or the use of proprietary software. Here, we present a unified and user-friendly pipeline for processing, aligning, and analyzing cycIHC data - Cyclic Analysis of Single-Cell Subsets and Tissue Territories (CASSATT). CASSATT registers scanned slide images across all rounds of staining, segments individual nuclei, and measures marker expression on each detected cell. Beyond straightforward single cell data analysis outputs, CASSATT explores the spatial relationships between cell populations. By calculating the logodds of interaction frequencies between cell populations within tissues and tissue regions, this pipeline helps users identify populations of cells that interact - or do not interact - at frequencies that are greater than those occurring by chance. It also identifies specific neighborhoods of cells based on the assortment of neighboring cell types that surround each cell in the sample. The presence and location of these neighborhoods can be compared across slides or within distinct regions within a tissue. CASSATT was first tested using a newly generated cycIHC dataset consisting of six GBM tissue sections processed through eight cycles of AEC based IHC staining. Further validation was completed on a previously published lung cancer tissue microarray dataset consisting of 107 cores processed through eighteen cycles of staining and imaging. CASSATT is a fully open-source workflow tool developed to process cycIHC data and will allow greater utilization of this powerful staining technique.",

    "abstract": "In discovery proteomics, as well as many other \"omic\" approaches, the possibility to test for the differential abundance of hundreds (or of thousands) of features simultaneously is appealing, despite requiring specific statistical safeguards, among which controlling for the False Discovery Rate (FDR) has become standard. Moreover, when more than two biological conditions or group treatments are considered, it has become customary to rely on the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) framework, where a first global differential abundance landscape provided by an omnibus test can be subsequently refined using various post-hoc tests. However, the interactions between the FDR control procedures and the post-hoc tests are complex, because both correspond to different types of multiple test corrections. This article surveys various ways to orchestrate them in a data processing workflow and discusses their pros and cons.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities in nature are dynamically evolving as member species change their interactions subject to environmental variations. Accounting for such context-dependent dynamic variations in interspecies interactions is critical for predictive ecological modeling. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how microbial interactions are driven by environmental factors due to the absence of generalizable theoretical foundations, significantly limiting our capability to predict and engineer community dynamics and function. To address this issue, we propose a novel theoretical framework that allows us to represent interspecies interactions as an explicit function of environmental variables (such as substrate concentrations) by combining growth kinetics and a generalized Lotka-Volterra model. A synergistic integration of these two complementary models leads to the prediction of alterations in interspecies interactions as the outcome of dynamic balances between positive and negative influences of microbial species in mixed relationships. This unique capability of our approach was experimentally demonstrated using a synthetic consortium of two Escherichia coli mutants that are metabolically dependent (due to an inability to synthesize essential amino acids), but competitively growing on a shared substrate. The analysis of the E. coli binary consortium using our model not only showed how interactions between the two amino acid auxotrophic mutants are controlled by the dynamic shifts in limiting substrates, but also enabled quantifying previously uncharacterizable complex aspects of microbial interactions such as asymmetry in interactions. Our approach can be extended to other related ecological systems to model their environment-dependent interspecies interactions from growth kinetics.\n\nIMPORTANCEModeling of environment-controlled interspecies interactions through separate identification of positive and negative influences of microbes in mixed relationships is a new capability that can significantly improve our ability to understand, predict, and engineer complex dynamics of microbial communities. Moreover, robust prediction of microbial interactions as a function of environmental variables can serve as valuable benchmark data to validate modeling and network inference tools in microbial ecology, the development of which has often been impeded due to the lack of ground truth information on interactions. While demonstrated against microbial data, the theory developed in this work is readily applicable to general community ecology to predict interactions among microorganisms such as plants and animals, as well as microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing (SCS) enables exploring the pathways and processes of cells, and cell populations. However, there is a paucity of pathway enrichment methods designed to tolerate the high noise and low gene coverage of this technology. When gene expression data are noisy and signals are sparse, testing pathway enrichment based on the genes expression may not yield statistically significant results which is particularly problematic when detecting the pathways enriched in less abundant cells that are vulnerable to disturbances. In this project, we developed a Weighted Concept Signature Enrichment Analysis (WCSEA) algorithm specialized for pathway enrichment analysis from single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). WCSEA took a broader approach for assessing the functional relations of pathway gene sets to differentially expressed genes, and leverage the cumulative signature of molecular concepts characteristic of the highly differentially expressed genes, which we termed as the universal concept signature, to tolerate the high noise and low coverage of this technology. We then incorporated WCSEA into a R package called \"IndepthPathway\" for biologists to broadly leverage this method for pathway analysis based on bulk and single cell sequencing data. Through simulating technical variability and dropouts in gene expression characteristic of scRNA-seq as well as benchmarking on a real dataset of matched single cell and bulk RNAseq data, we demonstrate that IndepthPathway presents outstanding stability and depth in pathway enrichment results under stochasticity of the data, thus will substantially improve the scientific rigor of the pathway analysis for single cell sequencing data.

    "abstract": "Inactive conformations of protein kinase catalytic domains where the DFG motif has a \"DFG-out\" orientation and the activation loop is folded present a druggable binding pocket that is targeted by FDA-approved \"type-II inhibitors\" in the treatment of cancers. Tyrosine Kinases (TKs) typically show strong binding affinity with a wide spectrum of type-II inhibitors while Serine/Threonine Kinases (STKs) usually bind more weakly which we suggest here is due to differences in the folded to extended conformational equilibrium of the activation loop between TKs vs. STKs. To investigate this, we use sequence covariation analysis with a Potts Hamiltonian statistical energy model to guide absolute binding free-energy molecular dynamics simulations of 74 protein-ligand complexes. Using the calculated binding free energies together with experimental values, we estimated free-energy costs for the large-scale ([~]17-20[A]) conformational change of the activation loop by an indirect approach, circumventing the very challenging problem of simulating the conformational change directly. We also used the Potts statistical potential to thread large sequence ensembles over active and inactive kinase states. The structure-based and sequence-based analyses are consistent; together they suggest TKs evolved to have free-energy penalties for the classical \"folded activation loop\" DFG-out conformation relative to the active conformation that is, on average, 4-6 kcal/mol smaller than the corresponding values for STKs. Potts statistical energy analysis suggests a molecular basis for this observation, wherein the activation loops of TKs are more weakly \"anchored\" against the catalytic loop motif in the active conformation, and form more stable substrate-mimicking interactions in the inactive conformation. These results provide insights into the molecular basis for the divergent functional properties of TKs and STKs, and pharmacological implications for the target selectivity of type-II inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy plays an important role in debulking tumors in advance of surgery and/or radiotherapy, tackling residual disease, and treating metastatic disease. In recent years many promising advanced drug delivery strategies have emerged that offer more targeted delivery approaches to chemotherapy treatment. For example, thermosensitive liposome mediated drug delivery in combination with localized mild hyperthermia can increase local drug concentrations resulting in a reduction in systemic toxicity and an improvement in local disease control. However, the majority of solid tumor associated deaths are due to metastatic spread. A therapeutic approach focused on a localized target area harbors the risk of overlooking and undertreating potential metastatic spread. Previous studies reported systemic, albeit limited, anti-tumor effects following treatment with thermosensitive liposomal chemotherapy and localized mild hyperthermia. This work explores the systemic treatment capabilities of a thermosensitive liposome formulation of the vinca alkaloid vinorelbine in combination with mild hyperthermia in an immunocompetent murine model of rhabdomyosarcoma. This treatment approach was found to be highly effective at heated, primary tumor sites. However, it demonstrated limited anti-tumor effects in secondary, distant tumors. As a result, the addition of immune checkpoint inhibition therapy was pursued to further enhance the systemic anti-tumor effect of this treatment approach. Once combined with immune checkpoint inhibition therapy, a significant improvement in systemic treatment capability was achieved. We believe this is one of the first studies to demonstrate that a triple combination of thermosensitive liposomes, localized mild hyperthermia, and immune checkpoint inhibition therapy can enhance the systemic treatment capabilities of thermosensitive liposomes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505721v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f5faa9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b89f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fdab72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@102ce7d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Activation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors (1-ARs), particularly the 1A subtype, protects the murine heart against injury, whereas human studies show that 1-AR antagonists (-blockers) may increase the risk of heart failure. We created a cardiomyocyte-specific 1A-AR knockout mouse (cmAKO) to define the mechanisms underlying these effects and to elucidate whether they arise from cardiomyocyte 1A-ARs or systemic factors. Myocardial infarction (MI) resulted in 70% 7-day mortality in cmAKO compared to 10% in wild type (WT) mice. cmAKO mice exhibited exaggerated ventricular remodeling and increased cell death compared to WT mice 3 days post-MI, coupled to upregulation of canonical mediators of necroptosis: receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinases RIP1 and RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. An 1A-AR agonist mitigated ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death and necroptotic signaling in vitro. A RIP1 antagonist abrogated the protective effects of 1A activation in vivo and in vitro. We found that patients at our center who were taking -blockers at the time of MI experienced a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.53, p=0.029) during 5-year follow-up, providing clinical correlation for our experimental data. Collectively our findings indicate that cardiomyocyte 1A-ARs constrain ischemia-induced necroptosis and suggest caution in the use of -blockers in patients at risk for MI.",

Whether semi-terrestrial, strong hyper/hypo-osmoregulators exhibit this ability is not known. We investigate FAA mobilization in muscle tissue of ten fiddler crabs from the genera Minuca, Leptuca and Uca distributed along the Atlantic coast of South America. Crabs were subjected to severe hypo- or hyper-osmotic challenge at their upper or lower critical salinity limits for five days; control crabs were held in isosmotic media. Hemolymph osmolality was measured, chela muscle FAA were identified and quantified, and percent contribution to intracellular osmolality (%FAA) was calculated. At isosmoticity, total FAA were nominally 2-fold higher in Minuca species ({approx}116 mmol/kg wet mass) than in Uca ({approx}60 mmol/kg wet mass). Glycine, alanine, arginine and taurine constituted >80% of total FAA. On hyper-osmotic challenge, hemolymph osmolalities ranged from 843 to 1,282 mOsm/kg H2O. FAA increased, although %FAA remained unaltered. Hypo-osmoregulating crabs thus can mobilize FAA, likely owing to a lesser ability to secrete salt near their upper critical limits. On hypo-osmotic challenge, osmolalities were more tightly regulated, between 475 and 736 mOsm/kg H2O. Total FAA and %FAA showed little change, probably due to the crabs strong hyper-osmotic extracellular regulation, FAA consequently playing a diminished role in isosmotic intracellular regulation. Total FAA responses to hyper/hypo-osmotic challenge are thus asymmetrical. There was no effect of crab genus on total FAA or on %FAA at isosmoticity or on either osmotic challenge, reinforced by the absence of phylogenetic signal.",

Here we characterize the use of Polycomb response elements and the inducible Heat shock protein 70Bb promoter, previously described as a non-leaky inducible system, to regulate Cas9 endonuclease levels and function in Drosophila melanogaster after varying both heat shock durations and rearing temperatures. We show that Polycomb response elements can significantly reduce expression of Cas9 under Heat shock protein 70Bb promoter control using a range of conditions, corroborating previously published results. We further demonstrate that this low transcript level of heat-induced Cas9 is sufficient to induce mutant mosaic phenotypes. Incomplete suppression of an inducible Cas9 system by Polycomb response elements with no heat shock suggests that further regulatory elements are required to precisely control Cas9 expression and abundance.",

Three distinct response patterns were identified, defined as intervention-specific reversions, non-reversions, and specific intervention-induced effects, which depended on the underlying proteotype and varied significantly across organs. In the later stages of the disease, Gcc enhanced some positive treatment effects of Mem with superior reduction of the inflammatory response in the kidneys and partial restoration of sepsis-induced metabolic dysfunction. Unexpectedly, Mem introduced sepsis-independent perturbations in the mitochondrial proteome that were to some degree counteracted by Gcc. In summary, this study provides a pharmacoproteomic resource describing the time-resolved septic organ failure landscape across organs and blood, coupled to a novel scoring strategy that captures unintended secondary drug effects as an important criterion to consider when assessing therapeutic efficacy. Such information is critical for quantitative, objective, and organotypic assessment of benefits and unintended effects of candidate treatments in relationship to dosing, timing, and potential synergistic combinations in murine sepsis models.",

    "abstract": "Many mental illnesses are accompanied by abnormal risk-avoidance behavior, yet we have only a limited understanding of the neuronal regulatory mechanisms involved. We previously established an inducible DISC1-N terminal fragment transgenic mouse (DISC1-NTM) model which has exhibited risk-avoidance deficiency. Using this model, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using snRNA-seq and the results indicate impaired neuron-astrocyte interactions. We used optogenetic tools to modulate astrocytes in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and found that ChR2-expressing astrocytes were able to rescue risk-avoidance impairment in DISC1-NTM mice. Using patch clamp recordings combined with signal-cell qPCR, we found impaired excitability of BLAWFS1 neurons in DISC1-NTM mice and that ChR2-expressing astrocytes can induce action potentials (APs) in WFS1 neurons, which restores WFS1 neuronal activity. WFS1 neurons are necessary for BLA astrocytes to modulate impaired risk-avoidance behavior. These finding provide new insights into mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron interactions and suggest that BLA astrocytes may be a promising target for impaired risk avoidance in mental illness.\n\nHighlightsChR2-expressing astrocytes in the BLA rescue impaired risk-avoidance behavior in DISC1-NTM mice.\n\nAstrocytes in the BLA modulate different nearby neurons to different degrees.

    "abstract": "The sense of body ownership, defined as the sensation that ones body belongs to oneself, is a fundamental component of bodily self-consciousness. Several studies have shown the importance of multisensory integration for the emergence of the sense of body ownership, together with the involvement of the parieto-premotor and extrastriate cortices in bodily awareness. However, whether the sense of body ownership elicited by different sources of signal, especially visuotactile and visuomotor inputs, is represented by common neural patterns remains to be elucidated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the existence of neural correlates of the sense of body ownership independent of the sensory modalities. Participants received tactile stimulation or executed finger movements while given synchronous and asynchronous visual feedback of their hand. We used multi-voxel patterns analysis (MVPA) to decode the synchronous and asynchronous conditions with cross-classification between two modalities: the classifier was first trained in the visuotactile sessions and then tested in the visuomotor sessions and vice versa. Regions of interest-based and searchlight analyses revealed significant above-chance cross-classification accuracies in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the bilateral ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and the left extrastriate body area (EBA). Moreover, we observed a significant positive correlation between the cross-classification accuracy in the left PMv and the difference in subjective ratings of the sense of body ownership between the synchronous and asynchronous conditions. Our findings revealed the neural representations of the sense of body ownership in the IPS, PMv, and EBA that is invariant to the sensory modalities.\n\nSignificance StatementPrevious studies have shown neural correlates of the sense of body ownership in parieto-premotor and extrastriate cortices.

Furthermore, cross-classification accuracy in PMv was positively correlated with subjective ratings of the sense of body ownership.

    "abstract": "SignificanceMachine learning (ML) models based on deep convolutional neural networks have been used to significantly increase microscopy resolution, speed (signal-to-noise ratio), and data interpretation. The bottleneck in developing effective ML systems is often the need to acquire large datasets to train the neural network. This paper demonstrates how adding a \"dense encoder-decoder\" block can be used to effectively train a neural network that produces super-resolution images from conventional microscopy diffraction-limited images trained using a small dataset (15 field-of-views).\n\nAimML helps to retrieve super-resolution information from a diffraction-limited image when trained with a massive training dataset. The aim of this work is to demonstrate a neural network that estimates super-resolution images from diffraction-limited images using modifications that enable training with a small dataset.\n\nApproachWe employ \"Dense Encoder-Decoder\" (called DenseED) blocks in existing super-resolution ML network architectures. DenseED blocks use a dense layer that concatenates features from the previous convolutional layer to the next convolutional layer. DenseED blocks in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) estimate the super-resolution images when trained with a small training dataset (15 field-of-views) of human cells from the Widefield2SIM dataset and in fluorescent-labeled fixed bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAE samples).\n\nResultsConventional ML models without DenseED blocks trained on small datasets fail to accurately estimate super-resolution images while models including the DenseED blocks can. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and resolution improvements achieved by networks containing DenseED blocks are {approx}3.2 dB and 2x, respectively. We evaluated various configurations of target image generation methods (e.g, experimentally captured target and computationally generated target) that are used to train FCNs with and without DenseED blocks and showed including DenseED blocks in simple FCNs outperforms compared to simple FCNs without DenseED blocks.\n\nConclusionsDenseED blocks in neural networks show accurate extraction of super-resolution images even if the ML model is trained with a small training dataset of 15 field-of-views. This approach shows that microscopy applications can use DenseED blocks to train on smaller datasets that are application-specific imaging platforms and there is a promise for applying this to other imaging modalities such as MRI/X-ray, etc.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder characterised by a tendency to have recurrent, spontaneous, seizures. Classically, seizures are assumed to occur at random. However, recent research has uncovered underlying rhythms both in seizures and in key signatures of epilepsy - so-called interictal epileptiform activity - with timescales that vary from hours and days through to months. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that determine these rhythmic patterns of epileptiform discharges remains an open question. Many people with epilepsy identify precipitants of their seizures, the most common of which include stress, sleep deprivation and fatigue. To quantify the impact of these physiological factors, we analysed 24-hour EEG recordings from a cohort of 107 people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. We found two subgroups with distinct distributions of epileptiform discharges: one with highest incidence during sleep and the other during day-time. We interrogated these data using a mathematical model that describes the transitions between background and epileptiform activity in large-scale brain networks. This model was extended to include a time-dependent forcing term, where the excitability of nodes within the network could be modulated by other factors. We calibrated this forcing term using independently-collected human cortisol (the primary stress-responsive hormone characterised by circadian and ultradian patterns of secretion) data and sleep-staged EEG from healthy human participants. We found that either the dynamics of cortisol or sleep stage transition, or a combination of both, could explain most of the observed distributions of epileptiform discharges. Our findings provide conceptual evidence for the existence of underlying physiological drivers of rhythms of epileptiform discharges. These findings should motivate future research to explore these mechanisms in carefully designed experiments using animal models or people with epilepsy.\n\nAuthor summary65 million people have epilepsy worldwide. Many of these people report specific triggers that make their seizures (the primary symptom of epilepsy) more likely. Here, we use a mathematical model to understand the relationship between possible triggers and rhythms in epileptiform activity observed across the day.\n\nThe mathematical model describes the activity of connected brain regions, and how the excitability of these regions can change in response to different stimuli. Based on data collected from people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, we identify transitions between sleep stages and variation in concentration of the stress-hormone cortisol as candidate factors that influence how likely it is for epileptiform activity to occur. By including those factors into the model, we show they can explain most of the daily variability. More broadly, our approach provides a framework for better understanding what factors drive the occurrence of epileptiform activity and offers the potential to suggest experiments that can validate model predictions.",

    "abstract": "In aging cells and animal models of premature aging, heterochromatin loss coincides with the transcriptional activation of normally silenced endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Here we show that loss of heterochromatin maintenance and de-repression of ERVs results in neurodegeneration via the Complement cascade in an age dependent manner. We discovered differential contributions of HP1 proteins to ERV silencing where HP1{gamma} is necessary and sufficient for H4K20me3 deposition and HP1{beta} deficiency is detrimental to DNA maintenance methylation. Progressive ERV de-repression in HP1{beta}/{gamma} DKO mice was followed by stimulation of the integrated stress response, the induction of Complement 3+ reactive astrocytes and increased infiltration and activation of microglia. This chronic inflammatory state coincided with age-dependent reductions in dendrite complexity and cognition. Our results demonstrate the importance of preventing loss of epigenetic maintenance, as this will be the only way postmitotic neuronal genomes can be protected and/or renewed.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505641v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (75K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f2ca5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c2f0bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b1db6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8bb72a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TAR-DNA-Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) are a key hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is characterised by a loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord that is preceded by early-stage changes in synaptic function that may be associated with TDP-43 pathology. However, there has been little characterisation of the synaptic expression of TDP-43 in spinal cord synapses. This study utilises a range of high-resolution and super-resolution microscopy techniques with immunolabelling, as well as an aptamer-based TDP-43 labelling strategy visualised with single-molecule localisation microscopy, to characterise and quantify the presence of phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) in spinal cord synapses. We observe that TDP-43 is expressed in the majority of spinal cord synapses as nanoscale clusters as small as 60 nm in diameter. Synaptic TDP-43 expression is more frequently associated with presynaptic terminals than postsynaptic densities, and is more enriched in VGLUT1-associated synapses, compared to VGLUT2-associated synapses. Our nanoscopy techniques showed no difference in the subsynaptic expression of pTDP-43 in the ALS mouse model, SOD1G93a compared to healthy controls. This research characterizes the basic synaptic expression of TDP-43 with nanoscale precision and provides a framework with which to investigate the potential relationship between TDP-43 pathology and synaptic pathology in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Because of the antibiotic crisis, AMPs have also become candidates for developing new drugs. Here, we show that five different AMPs of different classes are effective against non-dividing E. coli and S. aureus. By comparison, three conventional antibiotics from the main three classes of antibiotics poorly kill non-dividing bacteria at clinically relevant doses. The killing of fast-growing bacteria by AMPs is faster than that of slow-dividing bacteria and, in some cases, without any difference. Still, non-dividing bacteria are effectively killed over time. Our results point to a general property of AMPs, which might explain why selection has favoured AMPs in the evolution of metazoan immune systems. The ability to kill non-dividing cells is another reason that makes AMPs exciting candidates for drug development.",

It involves successive rounds of branch elongation and branch point generation to generate a branched epithelial network. Branch points form most commonly at the tips of branches as they split into two. However, it is unclear how epithelial cells in tips drive both elongation and branching. In this study, we used ex vivo live imaging to identify these fundamental cellular mechanisms in the embryonic mammary gland. Our 4D analyses show that tips of branches are driven forward by directional cell migration, while elongation of the subtending duct is supported by cell proliferation that feeds a retrograde flow of lagging cells into the duct, established upon differential cell motility. Tip bifurcation involved localized repression of both cell cycle and cell motility at the branch point. Cells in the nascent daughter tips remained proliferative, but changed the direction of their movement to elongate new branches. Our study also reports the fundamental importance of the contractile actin cytoskeleton in regulating branch point generation in the mammary epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a critical negative immune regulator. It binds AU-rich elements in the untranslated-regions of many mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory mediators, thereby accelerating their decay. A key but poorly understood mechanism of TTP regulation is its timely proteolytic removal: TTP is degraded by the proteasome through yet unidentified phosphorylation-controlled drivers. In this study, we set out to identify factors controlling TTP stability. Cellular assays showed that TTP is strongly lysine-ubiquitinated, which is required for its turnover. A genetic screen identified the ubiquitin E3 ligase HUWE1 as a strong regulator of TTP proteasomal degradation, which we found to control TTP stability indirectly by regulating its phosphorylation. Pharmacological assessment of multiple kinases revealed that HUWE1-regulated TTP phosphorylation and stability was independent of the previously characterized effects of MAPK-mediated S52/S178 phosphorylation. HUWE1 function was dependent on phosphatase and E3 ligase binding sites identified in the TTP C-terminus. Our findings indicate that while phosphorylation of S52/S178 is critical for TTP stabilization at earlier times after pro-inflammatory stimulation, phosphorylation of the TTP C-terminus controls its stability at later stages.",

There are currently no FDA-approved strategies to restore damaged RPE cells. Stimulating intrinsic regenerative responses within damaged tissues has gained traction as a possible mechanism for tissue repair. Zebrafish possess remarkable regenerative abilities, including within the RPE; however, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. Here, we conducted an F0 in vivo CRISPR-Cas9-mediated screen of 27 candidate RPE regeneration genes. The screen involved injection of a ribonucleoprotein complex containing three highly mutagenic guide RNAs per target gene followed by PCR-based genotyping to identify large intragenic deletions and MATLAB-based automated quantification of RPE regeneration. Through this F0 screening pipeline, eight positive and seven negative regulators of RPE regeneration were identified. Further characterization of one candidate, cldn7b, revealed novel roles in regulating macrophage/microglia infiltration after RPE injury and in clearing RPE/pigment debris during late-phase RPE regeneration. Taken together, these data support the utility of targeted F0 screens for validating pro-regenerative factors and reveal novel factors that could regulate regenerative responses within the zebrafish RPE.\n\nSummary statementWe present a rapid CRISPR-Cas9-mediated F0 screen, which revealed novel regulators of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regeneration in zebrafish.

Changes in marine prey availability and nutritional quality can affect juvenile salmon conditions (i.e., growth, condition, and mortality) during the early marine phase. There is limited knowledge of the interplay between prey availability and prey quality and the importance of food quality under food-satiated conditions. Here, a three-phase feeding experiment measured the effects of nutritional quality (fatty acid composition and ratios) on juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) condition. Experimental diets represented the present three different climate scenarios with a present-day diet (Euphausia pacifica), a control diet (commercial aquaculture diet), and a predicted IPCC worst-case scenario diet with low essential fatty acid concentrations (IPCC SSP5-8.5). We tested how potential future low quality food affects growth rates, body condition, fatty acid composition and mortality rates in juvenile Chinook salmon compared to present-quality prey. Fatty acids were incorporated into the salmon muscle at varying rates but, on average, reflected dietary concentrations. High dietary concentrations of DHA, EPA and high DHA:EPA ratios resulted in increased fish growth and condition. In contrast, low concentrations of DHA and EPA and low DHA:EPA ratios in the diets were not compensated for by increased food quantity. This result highlights the importance of considering food quality when assessing fish response to changing ocean conditions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIClimate change may decrease the quality of salmon prey through changes in the fatty acid composition.\nC_LIO_LILow dietary essential fatty acid levels reduce growth and condition and increase mortality rates in juvenile Chinook salmon.\nC_LIO_LIFood quality changes within zooplankton species but also by changes between species.\nC_LIO_LIResults suggest potential cascading effects on higher trophic levels when zooplankton species composition shifts to lower quality species.\nC_LIO_LIHigher food intake cannot compensate for low food quality.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Affiliative social behaviors are linked to fitness components in multiple species. However, the role of genetic variance in shaping affiliative social behaviors remains largely unknown, limiting our understanding of how these behaviors can respond to natural selection. Here, we employed the  animal model to estimate both environmental and genetic sources of variance and covariance in grooming behavior in the well-studied Amboseli baboon population in Kenya. We found that grooming given, grooming received, and total grooming all are similarly heritable (h2=0.22, h2=0.16, and h2=0.26 respectively), and that rank and the presence of kin contribute to environmental variance. We detected small but measurable indirect genetic effects of partner identity on the amount of grooming given within dyadic grooming partnerships. The genetic correlation between grooming given and grooming received was exceptionally strong and positive (R=0.94 {+/-} 0.12), and the indirect and direct genetic effects for grooming given were also strongly positively correlated (R=0.86 {+/-} 0.06). Our results provide insight into the evolvability of affiliative behavior in wild animals, including the possibility for correlations between direct and indirect genetic effects to accelerate the response to selection. As such they provide novel information about the genetic architecture of social behavior in nature, with important implications for the evolution of cooperation and reciprocity.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune system detects viral infection via pattern recognition receptors and induces defense reactions such as production of type I interferon1. One such receptor, MDA5, is activated upon the recognition of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that are often produced during viral replication2. Endogenous dsRNAs evade MDA5 activation through RNA editing by ADAR1, thus preventing autoimmunity3-5. Among the large number of endogenous dsRNAs, the key substrates whose editing is critical to evade MDA5 activation (termed as immunogenic dsRNAs) remain elusive. Here we reveal the identity of human immunogenic dsRNAs, a surprisingly small fraction of all cellular dsRNAs, to fill the gap in the ADAR1-dsRNA-MDA5 axis. We found that, in contrast to previous findings6,7, the immunogenic dsRNAs were highly enriched in mRNAs and depleted of introns, an expected indication of bona fide substrates of cytosolic MDA5. The immunogenic dsRNAs, in contrast to non-immunogenic dsRNAs, tended to have shorter loop between the stems, which may facilitate dsRNA formation. They also tended to be enriched at the GWAS signals of common inflammatory diseases, implying that they are truly immunogenic. We validated the MDA5-dependent immunogenicity of the dsRNAs, which was dampened following ADAR1-mediated RNA editing. We anticipate that a focused analysis of immunogenic dsRNAs will greatly facilitate the understanding and treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases in which the important roles of dsRNA editing and sensing continue to be revealed8-13.",

    "abstract": "Developmental enhancers are essential regulatory elements that drive precise spatio-temporal gene expression patterns. They do so by interacting with the promoter of their target genes, often across large genomic distances, in a highly specific manner. However, it is unclear how such specificity can be achieved. While several studies have suggested that Topologically Associating Domains (TADs)1-3 facilitate and constrain enhancer-promoter interactions, the role of TAD boundaries in effectively restricting enhancer-promoter interactions is heavily debated. Here we show that enhancers can establish long-range interactions across TAD boundaries and even between different chromosomes. Moreover, some of these interactions are functional in vivo, illustrating their functional importance. Using the twist locus in Drosophila embryos, we systematically relocated one of its enhancers to different regulatory contexts and distances from the twist promoter. We found that the twist promoter can engage in functional enhancer-promoter interactions across a TAD boundary and that distal interactions are sometimes favored over proximal ones. Our results demonstrate that TAD boundaries are not sufficient to constrain enhancer-promoter interactions and that the formation of long-range interactions is not solely driven by distance. These observations suggest that other general mechanisms must exist to establish and maintain specific enhancer-promoter interactions across large distances.",

    "abstract": "Genome assembly can be challenging for species that are characterized by high amounts of polymorphism, heterozygosity, and large effective population sizes. High levels of heterozygosity can result in genome mis-assemblies and a larger than expected genome size due to the haplotig versions of a single locus being assembled as separate loci. Here, we describe the first chromosome-level genome for the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Publicly released and annotated in 2017, the assembly has a scaffold N50 of 54 mb and is over 97.3% complete based on BUSCO analysis. The genome assembly for the eastern oyster is a critical resource for foundational research into molluscan adaptation to a changing environment and for selective breeding for the aquaculture industry. Subsequent resequencing data suggested the presence of haplotigs in the original assembly, and we developed a post hoc method to break up chimeric contigs and mask haplotigs in published heterozygous genomes and evaluated improvements to the accuracy of downstream analysis. Masking haplotigs had a large impact on SNP discovery and estimates of nucleotide diversity and had more subtle and nuanced effects on estimates of heterozygosity, population structure analysis, and outlier detection. We show that haplotig-masking can be a powerful tool for improving genomic inference, and we present an open, reproducible resource for the masking of haplotigs in any published genome.",

    "abstract": "CONSPECTUSO_ST_ABSAimsC_ST_ABSThe ribosomal protein (r-protein) of bacteria is composed of 2.6 MDa ribonucleoproteins of the 30S and 50S subunits, which are essential elements for protein translation. The translational initiation step is an intensive regulated multi-step reaction in protein biosynthesis. During bacterial protein synthesis, the correct reading frame of the mRNA defines when the initiator fMet-tRNAiMet binds to the start codon AUG at the P-site of the 30S subunit. The formation of the P-site of the 30S subunit initiation complex (30S-IC) is governed by three ubiquitous initiation factors (IFs) such as IF1, IF2, and IF3. IF2 protein is an essential player that plays during the last stage of the initiation process. Earlier, Stokes and his co-workers studied chemicals probes using 30K diverse drugs that induced cold-sensitive growth inhibition in the bacterium. The assay studies revealed, Lamotrigine (LTG) effectively binds at domain II of IF2 protein. In our research, we took an attempt in identifying promising active residues that could responsible for anti-bacterial bioactivity with help of computational studies.\n\nComputational MethodsIn the present study, initially, we performed C- backbone alignment with the retrieved IF2 chain from AlphaFold. Further, we utilized SiteMap and CastP for the identification of plausible active binding sites. Further, we bound LTG with the designated domain(s) of IF2 protein and studied its binding affinity potential with help of adaptive molecular dynamics simulations at atomic levels using Desmond.\n\nKey FindingsOur research findings have shown accurate results and we could able to prove the assertion in contrast with the findings of Stokes and his co-workers where the LTG bind at domain II of IF2 protein. The key interacting residue Glu179 was revealed to have strong hydrogen bonding contacts with LTG at the sub-nanomolar range. In addition, we predicted the alternative promising site I Further, we gained in-depth analysis for studying multiple sites, to understand the synergism inhibitory activity. Promisingly, LTG could be able to bound with at Site 1 showing better affinity over the proposed domain II and other predicted sites. The adaptive molecular dynamics studies confirmed the promising active residues\n\nSignificanceThe binding site predictions approach provides an insight for further development of anti-bacterial therapeutics that might helpful for bacteria disease management and exhibiting inhibitory activity against various strains.",

However, the underlying mechanism of how H2A.Z influences nucleosome stability, dynamics and DNA accessibility remains elusive as experimental and computational evidence are inconclusive. Our modeling efforts of nucleosome stability and dynamics, along with comparisons with experimental data show that the incorporation of H2A.Z results in a substantial decrease of the energy barrier for DNA unwrapping. This leads to spontaneous DNA unwrapping of about forty base pairs in total, enhanced DNA accessibility, nucleosome gapping and histone plasticity, which otherwise is not observed for canonical nucleosomes. We demonstrate that both N- and C-terminal tails of H2A.Z play major roles in these events, whereas H3.3 variant exerts a negligible impact in modulating the DNA end unwrapping. In summary, our results indicate that H2A.Z deposition makes nucleosomes more mobile and DNA more accessible to transcriptional machinery and other chromatin components.",

Enhancing crops nutrient use efficiency is thus an important goal, but requires a better understanding of related traits and their genetic basis.\n\nWe investigated variation in low nutrient stress tolerance in a diverse panel of cultivated sunflower genotypes grown under high and low nutrient conditions, assessing relative growth rate (RGR) as performance. We assessed variation in traits related to nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE), mass allocation, and leaf elemental content.\n\nAcross genotypes, nutrient limitation reduced RGR. Moreover, higher vigor (higher control RGR) was associated with a greater absolute decrease under stress. Given this trade-off, we focused on nutrient stress tolerance independent from vigor. This tolerance metric correlated with the change in NUtE, plasticity for a suite of morphological traits, and leaf element content. Genome-wide association analyses revealed regions associated with variation and plasticity in multiple traits, including two key regions with ostensibly additive effects on NUtE change.\n\nOur results demonstrate potential avenues for improving sunflower nutrient stress tolerance independent from vigor and highlight specific traits and genomic regions that could play a role in enhancing tolerance.\n\nHighlightGenetic associations and trait correlations show that, in cultivated sunflower, selection for increased nitrogen utilization efficiency and plasticity in key traits is a promising avenue for increasing nutrient stress tolerance.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus (HP) receives neurochemically diverse inputs from the raphe nuclei, including glutamatergic fibers characterized by the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3. These raphe-HP VGLUT3 (VGLUT3HP) projections have been suggested to play a critical role in HP functions, yet a complete anatomical overview of raphe VGLUT3 projections to the forebrain, and in particular the HP, is lacking. Using anterograde viral tracing, we describe largely non-overlapping VGLUT3-positive projections from the dorsal raphe (DR) and median raphe (MnR) to the forebrain, with the HP receiving inputs from the MnR. A limited subset of forebrain regions such as the amygdaloid complex, claustrum and hypothalamus receive projections from both the DR and MnR that remain largely segregated. This highly complementary anatomical pattern suggests contrasting roles for DR and MnR VGLUT3 neurons. To further analyse the topography of VGLUT3 raphe projections to the HP, we used retrograde tracing and found that VGLUT3HP neurons distribute over several raphe sub-regions (including the MnR, paramedian raphe and B9 nucleus) and lack co-expression of serotonergic markers. Strikingly, two-color retrograde tracing unraveled two parallel streams of VGLUT3-positive projections targeting the dorsal and ventral poles of the HP. These results demonstrate highly organized and segregated VGLUT3-positive projections to the HP, suggesting independent modulation of HP functions such as spatial memory and emotion-related behavior.",

    "abstract": "Dexamethasone (dex) is a glucocorticoid that is a mainstay for treatment of inflammatory pathologies, including immunotherapy-associated toxicities. Dex suppresses the endogenous immune response and is also believed to suppress the function of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. However, recent reports observed higher CAR T cell numbers in patients treated with dex, highlighting the rationale for interrogating the specific effects of dex on CAR T cells. Here, we found that dex did not inhibit CAR T cell expansion or function. A single dose of dex during the manufacturing process upregulated the pro-persistence interleukin 7 receptor  (IL7R) on CAR T cells and induced expression of genes involved in activation, migration, and persistence. The ex vivo upregulation of IL7R induced by dex significantly enhanced CAR T cell persistence and anti-tumor efficacy in vivo when combined with exogenous IL-7. Moreover, the combination of dex and IL-7 resulted in increased persistence of CAR T cells and led to complete remission of mice. Overall, our studies in both in vitro and in vivo treatment support a positive role of dex on CAR T cell potency and provide insight into the application of glucocorticoids in cellular anti-cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Volatile fatty acids found in effluents of the dark fermentation of biowastes can be used for mixotrophic growth of microalgae, improving productivity and reducing the cost of the feedstock. Microalgae can use the acetate in the effluents very well, but butyrate is poorly assimilated and can inhibit growth above 1 gC.L-1. The non-photosynthetic chlorophyte alga Polytomella sp. SAG 198.80 was found to be able to assimilate butyrate fast. To decipher the metabolic pathways implicated in butyrate assimilation, quantitative proteomics study was developed comparing Polytomella sp. cells grown on acetate and butyrate at 1 gC.L-1. After statistical analysis, a total of 1772 proteins were retained, of which 119 proteins were found to be overaccumulated on butyrate vs. only 46 on acetate, indicating that butyrate assimilation necessitates additional metabolic steps. The data show that butyrate assimilation occurs in the peroxisome via the {beta}-oxidation pathway to produce acetyl-CoA and further tri/dicarboxylic acids in the glyoxylate cycle. Concomitantly, reactive oxygen species defense enzymes as well as the branched amino acid degradation pathway were strongly induced.Although no clear dedicated butyrate transport mechanism could be inferred, several membrane transporters induced on butyrate are identified as potential condidates. Metabolic responses correspond globally to the increased needs for central cofactors NAD, ATP and CoA, especially in the peroxisome and the cytosol.",

Researchers are making great efforts to develop a diagnostic technique with high levels of sensitivity and specificity, as accurate, early diagnosis is required to prevent the spread of these microorganisms and improve the prognosis of patients. In this context, CRISPR-Cas systems are proposed as promising tools for the development of diagnostic techniques due to their high specificity: Cas13 endonuclease discriminates single nucleotide changes and displays collateral activity against single-stranded RNA molecules. This technology is usually combined with isothermal pre-amplification reactions in order to increase the sensitivity of diagnosis. We have developed an RT-LAMP-CRISPR-Cas13a-based assay for the detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae OXA-48 producer strains in clinical samples without the need for RNA extraction. The assay exhibited 100 % specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.",

    "abstract": "Invasion of host cells by apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium spp requires the sequential secretion of the parasite apical organelles, the micronemes and the rhoptries. The claudin-like apicomplexan microneme protein (CLAMP) is a conserved protein that plays an essential role during invasion in Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites and Plasmodium falciparum merozoites. CLAMP is also expressed in Plasmodium sporozoites, the mosquito-transmitted forms of the malaria parasite, but its role in this stage is still unknown. CLAMP is essential for Plasmodium blood stage growth and is refractory to conventional gene deletion. To circumvent this obstacle and study the function of CLAMP in sporozoites, we used a conditional genome editing strategy based on the dimerisable Cre recombinase in the rodent malaria model parasite P. berghei. We successfully deleted clamp gene in P. berghei transmission stages and analyzed the functional consequences on sporozoite infectivity. In mosquitoes, sporozoite development and egress from oocysts was not affected in conditional mutants. However, invasion of the mosquito salivary glands was dramatically reduced upon deletion of clamp gene. In addition, CLAMP-deficient sporozoites were impaired in cell traversal and productive invasion of mammalian hepatocytes. This severe phenotype was associated with major defects in gliding motility and with reduced shedding of the sporozoite adhesin TRAP. These results demonstrate that CLAMP is essential across invasive stages of the malaria parasite, and strongly suggest that the protein acts upstream of host cell invasion, possibly by regulating the secretion or function of adhesins in Plasmodium sporozoites.\n\nAuthor summaryPlasmodium parasites, the causative agents of malaria, are transmitted during the bite of an infected mosquito. Infectious parasite stages known as sporozoites are released from the insect salivary glands and injected into the host skin. Sporozoites rapidly migrate to the host liver, invade hepatocytes and differentiate into the next invasive forms, the merozoites, which invade and replicate inside red blood cells. Sporozoite motility and host cell invasion rely on the secretion of apical organelles called micronemes and rhoptries. Here we characterize the function of a microneme protein expressed both in merozoites and sporozoites, the claudin-like protein CLAMP. We used a conditional genome editing strategy in a rodent malaria model to generate CLAMP-deficient sporozoites. In the absence of CLAMP, sporozoites failed to invade mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes, and showed defects in gliding motility and microneme secretion. Our data establish that CLAMP plays an essential role across Plasmodium invasive stages, and might represent a potential target for transmission-blocking antimalarial strategies.",

Gene-set enrichment analysis furthermore indicates that expression and splicing both convey shared and distinct biological signals.\n\nConclusionThese findings establish alternative splicing as a major regulator of the human condition and suggest that most contemporary RNA-seq studies likely miss out on critical biological insights.

A previously developed synthetic mouse L1 (smL1) with ORF adenosine content decreased from 40% to 26% showed higher mRNA expression levels and retrotransposed far more efficiently than the native parental element, L1spa. Here, we observe two nonsynonymous substitutions between the L1spa and smL1 ORF1 sequences, and note that the smL1 3UTR lacks a conserved guanosine-rich region (GRR). We find that the combined effect of these amino acid changes and the 3UTR deletion, rather than synthetic ORF sequences, accounts for the dramatic and reproducible increase in smL1 retrotransposition efficiency over L1spa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the position of the GRR within the L1 reporter construct impacts retrotransposition efficiency. Our results prompt a reevaluation of synthetic L1 activity and suggest that native mouse L1 mobility is frequently underestimated in engineered retrotransposition assays.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a state of stable growth arrest, usually accompanied by development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Although senescent cells remain metabolically active, little is known about their metabolic landscape and in vivo pathophysiological implications. Here we show that expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) inhibitory enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), is significantly upregulated in human senescent stromal cells. Preferentially expressed upon genotoxicity-induced senescence (GIS), PDK4 is negatively correlated with posttreatment survival of cancer patients. Upon cellular senescence, PDK4 shifts glucose metabolic flux from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, causing enhanced lactate production and forming an acidic microenvironment. However, distinct from the cancer cell-featured Warburg effect, senescent cells maintain an intensive use of pyruvate through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), displaying increased respiration and redox activity, indicative of a special form of metabolic reprogramming. Conditioned media from PDK4+ stromal cells change global expression and promote malignancy of recipient cancer cells in vitro and accelerate tumor progression in vivo. Pharmacologically targeting PDK4 restrains the adverse effects of PDK4 in cell-based assays, while promoting tumor regression and extending posttreatment survival in preclinical trials. Together, our study substantiates the hypercatabolic nature of senescent cells, and reveals a metabolic link between senescence-associated acidic microenvironment and age-related pathologies including but not limited to cancer.",

Differentiation in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea exemplifies this problem, as these animals continuously produce over 100 differentiated cell types for homeostasis and regeneration using neoblast adult pluripotent stem cells. The signaling factors enabling neoblast self-renewal and selective differentiation of these many fates are still incompletely understood. We developed a method using high-throughput expression profiling by qPCR and whole-animal RNAseq to simultaneously assess numerous cell fate markers as the phenotypic readout in large-scale RNAi screens. Applying this method, we performed an RNAi screen of 400 kinases, receptors, and other regulatory molecules to reveal specific functions for 30 previously unknown factors in neoblast biology. 17 genes were required for neoblast maintenance, including factors likely involved in cell-cycle regulation, nutrient sensing, and chromatin modification. Multidimensional expression information additionally revealed several specific regulators of other neoblast activities, including a mink1 kinase regulating global neoblast differentiation, the energy responsive kinase adenylate kinase-2 regulating intestine specification within the neoblast population, an RNA acetyl transferase nat10 regulating epidermal differentiation, and a pak1 kinase restricting neoblast localization to prevent tissue outgrowths. These results identify several new regulators of neoblast activities and demonstrate the applicability of expression-based screening for systematic analysis of stem cell phenotypes in whole animals.",

    "abstract": "Human-wildlife conflict becomes one of the fundamental aspects of wildlife management because it threatens both wildlife and human. People injured, abused, and killed wildlife in response to the perceived and/or actual damages from wildlife. Such negative interaction between humans and wildlife exists everywhere but more intense and costly in adjacent protected areas. This study aimed to assess the effects of human-wildlife conflicts on local peoples livelihood and wildlife conservation in and around Alitash National Park. The primary data were collected using multi-stage sampling techniques by employing a combination of social survey methods involving participatory techniques (focus group discussions and key informant interviews) and structured household interviewers. The survey questionnaire consisted of both open-ended and fixed-response questions designed to solicit information mainly for wildlife-caused damages and other costs to the local community along with human-induced wildlife decline and perceptions towards wildlife conservation. The results revealed that 59.6% of the respondents encountered at least a single type of damage. More than half (54%) of respondents encountered crop damage, of which 34.4% lost up to 25% of their crop fields whereas the amount of loss to the remaining (18.7%) was to 75% of the crop fields. The livestock loss during the last five years of the period prior to the survey administration was 287.89 tropical livestock units which were shared by 47.5% of the respondents. Wildlife attacks on humans were rare but eighteen attacks were caused by Panther leo, Crocuta crocuta and Panthera pardus were encountered when the victims cross the habitats of the species. The responses of the victims to the wildlife imposed the damage was negative and full of anger and resentment. This has been undermining conservation efforts and the socio-economic welfare of the local people around Alitash National Park. Providing alternative livelihood opportunities and creating a context-based conservation scheme along with continuous conservation education would help to reduce the negative effect of human-wildlife conflicts on both wildlife and people in the study area.",

The labeling strategy provided detailed structural information via NMR - down to individual enantiomers - which overcomes a crucial blind spot in the analysis of InsPs. We uncovered a novel branch of InsP dephosphorylation in human cells which is dependent on MINPP1, a phytase-like enzyme, that contributes to cellular homeostasis. Full characterization of MINPP1 activity in vitro and in cells, provided a clear picture of this multifunctional phosphatase.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely aggressive disease characterized by its metastatic potential and chemoresistance. These traits are partially attributable to the highly tumorigenic pancreatic cancer stem cells (PaCSCs). Interestingly, these cells show unique features in order to sustain their identity and functionality, some of them amenable for therapeutic intervention. Screening of phospho-receptor tyrosine kinases revealed that PaCSCs harbored increased activation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). We subsequently demonstrated that oncogenic ALK signaling drives tumorigenicity in PDAC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) by promoting stemness through ligand-dependent activation. Indeed, the ALK ligands midkine (MDK) or pleiotrophin (PTN) increased self-renewal, clonogenicity and CSC frequency in several in vitro local and metastatic PDX models. Conversely, treatment with the clinically-approved ALK inhibitors Crizotinib and Ensartinib decreased CSC content and functionality in vitro and in vivo, by inducing cell death. Strikingly, ALK inhibitors sensitized chemoresistant PaCSCs to Gemcitabine, as the most used chemotherapeutic agent for PDAC treatment. Consequently, ALK inhibition delayed tumor relapse after chemotherapy in vivo by effectively decreasing the content of PaCSCs. In summary, our results demonstrate that targeting the MDK/PTN-ALK axis with clinically-approved inhibitors impairs in vivo tumorigenicity and chemoresistance in PDAC suggesting a new treatment approach to improve the long-term survival of PDAC patients.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505637v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@21d661org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1817b5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca97aaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ab5443_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Magnitude dimensions such as time and numerosity are fundamental components of our visual experience, allowing us to understand the environment and interact with it. Different magnitudes are however not processed independently from each other, but show a relationship whereby the perception of one dimension depends on the others (\"magnitude integration\"). In this study, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to address whether such integration may arise from a shared brain processing stage where different dimensions are integrated together, or from independent parallel processes interfering with each other. In the experiment, participants judged either the average numerosity or duration of dynamic dot-array stimuli concurrently modulated in both dimensions. First, the behavioural results show a magnitude integration effect in both tasks, with duration affecting the judgement of numerosity and vice versa. The EEG results further show that both numerosity and duration significantly modulate event-related potentials at several distinct latencies. Crucially, however, we identified a significant interaction between numerosity and duration emerging in a specific latency window (360-460 ms) irrespective of the task performed by participants. In this latency window, the modulation of ERPs provided by the interfering magnitude dimension can be predicted by the strength of the behavioural bias. Our results thus support the idea of different magnitude dimensions converging onto a shared perceptual processing stage mediating their integration. Overall, our results demonstrate a clear electrophysiological signature of magnitude integration between numerosity and time, and provide new evidence for a shared representational system encompassing different magnitude dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Noradrenaline (NA) release from the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) changes activity and connectivity in neuronal networks across the brain, thus modulating multiple behavioural states. NA release is mediated by both tonic and burst-like neuronal LC activity. However, it remains unknown whether the functional changes in downstream projection areas depend on these firing patterns. Using optogenetics, pupillometry, photometry, and functional MRI in mice, we show that tonic and burst LC firing patterns elicit brain responses that are specific to the activation frequency and temporal pattern. Tonic activation of the LC evokes nonlinear responses in prefrontal, limbic, and cerebellar regions, in line with the proposed inverted-U relationship between LC activity and behaviour. We further demonstrate that LC activity enhances network integration and acts as a facilitator of brain state transitions, hence increasing brain flexibility. Together, these findings reveal how the LC-NA system achieves a nuanced regulation of global circuit operations.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of gene expression is constrained by the topology of gene regulatory networks, as co-expressed genes are likely to have their expressions affected together by mutations. Conversely, co-expression can also be an advantage when genes are under joint selection. Here, we assessed theoretically whether correlated selection (selection for a combination of traits) was able to affect the pattern of correlated gene expressions and the underlying gene regulatory networks. We ran individual-based simulations, applying a stabilizing correlated fitness function to three genetic architectures: a quantitative genetics (multilinear) model featuring epistasis and pleiotropy, a quantitative genetics model where each genes has an independent mutational structure, and a gene regulatory model, mimicking the mechanisms of gene expression regulation. Simulations showed that correlated mutational effects evolved in the three genetic architectures as a response to correlated selection, but the response in gene networks was specific. The intensity of gene co-expression was mostly explained by the regulatory distance between genes (largest correlations being associated to genes directly interacting with each other), and the sign of co-expression was associated with the nature of the regulation (transcription activation or inhibition). These results concur to the idea that gene network topologies could partly reflects past correlated selection patterns on gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Short linear motifs (SLiMs) in proteins are short functionally independent sequence stretches with a defined function and required for proteins to interact with their environment. Their functional importance makes it interesting to analyse SLiM features further, such as their structural or evolutionary properties, to understand better how SLiMs evolve to shape protein functions.\n\nWe developed an automated pipeline to analyse features of SLiMs, called evo-MOTiF. This pipeline takes as input a single protein sequence and its associated SLiM(s) and returns a set of scores associated with SLiM features, including their disorder, as well as their overall, positional and amino acid property conservation. To store and easily mine data from the evo-MOTiF pipeline, we developed the evo-MOTiF database, which currently holds [~]9500 motifs, combining data from ELM, PhosphoSitePlus, as well as from cross-linking mass-spectrometry (XL-MS) experiments. The evo-MOTiF database distinguishes itself further by allowing effortless filtering for SLiMs with specific properties, such as disorder, or conservation in evolution and by providing evolutionary, as well as structural information for SLiMs. Preliminary analysis of SLiM features reveals weak negative correlation between disorder and overall, positional, as well as amino acid property conservation, which is in support of previous observations on smaller datasets.\n\nThe evo-MOTiF pipeline and database are freely available at https://gitlab.com/habermann_lab/slims and http://etnadb.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/index.php, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal-entorhinal system uses cognitive maps to represent spatial knowledge and other types of relational information, such as the transition probabilities between objects. However, objects can often be characterized in terms of different types of relations simultaneously, e.g. semantic similarities learned over the course of a lifetime as well as transitions experienced over a brief timeframe in an experimental setting. Here we ask how the hippocampal formation handles the embedding of stimuli in multiple relational structures that differ vastly in terms of their mode and timescale of acquisition: Does it integrate the different stimulus dimensions into one conjunctive map, or is each dimension represented in a parallel map? To this end, we reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from Garvert et al. (2017) that had previously revealed an entorhinal map which coded for newly learnt statistical regularities. We used a triplet odd-one-out task to construct a semantic distance matrix for presented items and applied fMRI adaptation analysis to show that the degree of similarity of representations in bilateral hippocampus decreases as a function of semantic distance between presented objects. Importantly, while both maps localize to the hippocampal formation, this semantic map is anatomically distinct from the originally described entorhinal map. This finding supports the idea that the hippocampal-entorhinal system forms parallel cognitive maps reflecting the embedding of objects in diverse relational structures.",

    "abstract": "Differential gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data is a standard approach for making biological discoveries. Ongoing large-scale efforts to process and normalize publicly available gene expression data enable rapid and systematic reanalysis. While several powerful tools systematically process RNA-seq data, enabling their reanalysis, few resources systematically recompute differentially expressed genes (DEGs) generated from individual studies. We developed a robust differential expression analysis pipeline to recompute 3162 human DEG lists from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium, and 142 studies within the Sequence Read Archive. After measuring the accuracy of the recomputed DEG lists, we built the Differential Expression Enrichment Tool (DEET), which enables users to interact with the recomputed DEG lists. DEET, available through CRAN and RShiny, systematically queries which of the recomputed DEG lists share similar genes, pathways, and TF targets to their own gene lists. DEET identifies relevant studies based on shared results with the users gene lists, aiding in hypothesis generation and data-driven literature review.\n\nHighlightsBy curating metadata from uniformly processed human RNA-seq studies, we created a database of 3162 differential expression analyses.\n\nThese analyses include TCGA, GTEx, and 142 unique studies in SRA, involving 985 distinct experimental conditions.\n\nThe Differential Expression Enrichment Tool (DEET) allows users to systematically compare their gene lists to this database.",
