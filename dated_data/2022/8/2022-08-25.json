    "abstract": "Mood swings, or mood variability, are associated with negative mental health outcomes. Since adolescence is a time when mood disorder onset peaks, mood variability during this time is of significant interest. Understanding biological factors that might be associated with mood variability, such as sleep and structural brain development, could elucidate the mechanisms underlying mood and anxiety disorders. Data from the longitudinal Leiden Self-Concept study (N=171) over 5 yearly timepoints was used to study the association between sleep, brain structure, and mood variability in healthy adolescents aged 11-21 at baseline in this pre-registered study. Sleep was measured both objectively, using actigraphy, as well as subjectively, using a daily diary self-report. Negative mood variability was defined as day-to-day negative mood swings over a period of 5 days after an MRI scan. It was found that negative mood variability peaked in mid-adolescence in females while it linearly increased in males, and average negative mood showed a similar pattern. Sleep duration (subjective and objective) generally decreased throughout adolescence, with a larger decrease in males. Mood variability was not associated with sleep, but average negative mood was associated with lower self-reported energy. In addition, higher thickness in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) compared to same-age peers, suggesting a delayed thinning process, was associated with higher negative mood variability in early and mid-adolescence. Together, this study provides an insight into the development of mood variability and its association with brain structure.",

    "abstract": "1. Selective logging--the practice of removing a subset of commercially important trees from a forest--is a globally pervasive form of forest degradation. Selective logging alters both the structure and function of forests and the composition of ecological communities.\n\n2. Tropical insectivorous birds are highly vulnerable to microhabitat alterations in logged forest. Such altered microhabitats might affect the foraging of forest birds by altering (a) resource availability, and (b) foraging behaviour.\n\n3. We investigated the effect of selective logging on microclimates, prey availability, foraging behaviour and the foraging success of eastern Himalayan birds in the breeding season.\n\n4. Selective logging alters temperature-humidity microclimates and the composition of arthropod communities, both of which are likely to then collectively alter foraging behaviour by birds. We show that birds spent a lower proportion of their time foraging in primary compared with logged forest. Further, selective logging interacts with species traits such as body mass, preferred foraging stratum (understorey, midstorey or canopy) and foraging manoeuvre to influence foraging success. Gleaners generally foraged more successfully in primary forest and salliers in logged forest, although these patterns were modified by body mass and foraging stratum.\n\n5. Synthesis and applications: Our study shows how altered microclimates in anthropogenically modified habitats can influence resource availability and have downstream impacts on the behaviour of species at higher trophic levels.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome dynamics are both crucial indicators and drivers of human health, agricultural output, and industrial bio-applications. However, predicting microbiome dynamics is notoriously difficult because communities often show abrupt structural changes, such as \"dysbiosis\" in human microbiomes. We here integrate theoretical and empirical bases for anticipating drastic shifts of microbial communities. We monitored 48 experimental microbiomes for 110 days and observed that various community-level events, including collapse and gradual compositional changes, occurred according to a defined set of environmental conditions. We then confirmed that the abrupt community changes observed through the time-series could be described as shifts between \"alternative stable states\" or dynamics around complex attractors. Furthermore, collapses of microbiome structure were successfully anticipated by means of the diagnostic threshold defined with the energy landscape analysis of statistical physics or that of a stability index of nonlinear mechanics. These results indicate that abrupt microbiome events in complex microbial communities can be forecasted by extending classic ecological concepts to the scale of species-rich microbial systems.",

While this process has been extensively studied in vivo and in vitro, unphysiological reaction conditions of fibril formation in vitro have precluded the identification and mechanistic analysis of cellular proteins, which may alter PrP self-assembly and prion replication. Here, we have developed a fibril formation assay for recombinant murine and human PrP (23-231) under near-native conditions (NAA) to study the effect of cellular proteins, which may be risk factors or potential therapeutic targets in prion disease.\n\nGenetic screening identified syntaxin 6 (Stx6) as a risk factor for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Analysis of the protein in NAA revealed that Stx6 is a potent inhibitor of PrP fibril formation. It significantly delayed the lag phase of fibril formation at a highly sub-stoichiometric molar ratios. However, when assessing toxicity of different aggregation time points to primary neurons, Stx6 prolonged the presence of neurotoxic PrP species.\n\nElectron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed that PrP formed less-ordered aggregates with Stx6 instead of highly ordered fibrils, which contained Stx6. These data strongly suggest that the protein directly alters PrP self-assembly and, uniquely, acts as an  anti-chaperone, which promotes toxic aggregation intermediates by inhibiting fibril formation.",

    "abstract": "Recently we have concluded that image-based features derived from the microenvironment have an enormous impact on successfully determining the class of an object1. Here we demonstrate that deep learning-based phenotypic analysis of cells with a properly chosen microenvironment-size provides results comparable to our earlier neighbourhood-based methods that utilise hand-crafted image features. We hypothesised that treating cells with equal weight, regardless of their position within the cellular microenvironment, is suboptimal, and direct neighbours have a larger impact on the phenotype of the cell-of-interest than cells in its larger proximity. Hence we present a novel approach that (1) considers the fully featured view of the cell-of-interest, (2) includes the neighbourhood and (3) gives lesser weight to cells that are far from the cell. To achieve this, we present a transformation similar to those characteristic for fisheye cameras. Such a transformation satisfies all the above defined criteria, with a fast rate of transform for any images. Using the proposed transformation with proper settings we could significantly increase the accuracy of single-cell phenotyping, both in case of cell culture and tissue-based microscopy images. The range of potential applications of the proposed method goes beyond microscopy, as we present improved results on the iWildCam 2020 dataset containing images of wild animals.",

    "abstract": "Predicting protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important goal of computational biology. Various sources of information can be used to this end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of sequences is modest.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen two protein families interact, their sequences feature statistical dependencies. First, interacting proteins tend to share a common evolutionary history. Second, maintaining structure and interactions through the course of evolution yields coevolution, detectable via correlations in the amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",

However, the existence, prevalence and dynamics of such hierarchy in single cells remain unexplored. Here, we report a new generation TAD-like domain (TLD) detection algorithm, named deDoc2, to decode the hierarchy of TLDs in single cells. With dynamic programming, deDoc2 seeks genome partitions with global minimal structure entropy for both whole and local contact matrix. Compared to state-of-the-art tools, deDoc2 can uniquely identify the hierarchy of TLDs in single cells, in addition to outperforming its competitors. By applying deDoc2, we showed that the hierarchy of TLDs in single cells is highly dynamic during cell cycle, as well as among human brain cortex cells, and that it is associated with cellular identity and functions. Thus, our results demonstrated the abundance of information potentially encoded by TLD hierarchy for functional regulation.

However, relating the axes of a nonlinear embedding to the original dimensions is a nontrivial problem. In particular, humans may identify patterns or interesting subsections in the embedding, but cannot easily identify what those patterns correspond to in the original data. Thus, we present SlowMoMan (SLOW MOtions on MANifolds), a web application which allows the user to draw a 1-dimensional path onto the 2-dimensional embedding. Then, by back projecting the manifold to the original, high-dimensional space, we sort the original features such that those most discriminative along the manifold are ranked highly.

    "abstract": "Most endometrial cancers express the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and are driven by excess estrogen signaling. However, evaluation of the estrogen response in endometrial cancer cells has been limited by the availability of hormonally responsive in vitro models, with one cell line, Ishikawa, being used in most studies. Here, we describe a novel, adherent endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) cell line model, HCI-EC-23. We show that HCI-EC-23 retains ER expression and that ER functionally responds to estrogen induction over a range of passages. We also demonstrate that this cell line retains paradoxical activation of ER by tamoxifen, which is also observed in Ishikawa and is consistent with clinical data. The mutational landscape shows that HCI-EC-23 is mutated at many of the commonly altered genes in EEC, has relatively few copy-number alterations, and is microsatellite instable high (MSI-high). In vitro proliferation of HCI-EC-23 is strongly reduced upon combination estrogen and progesterone treatment. HCI-EC-23 exhibits strong estrogen dependence for tumor growth in vivo and tumor size is reduced by combination estrogen and progesterone treatment. Molecular characterization of estrogen induction in HCI-EC-23 revealed hundreds of estrogen-responsive genes that significantly overlapped with those regulated in Ishikawa. Analysis of ER genome binding identified similar patterns in HCI-EC-23 and Ishikawa, although ER exhibited more bound sites in Ishikawa. This study demonstrates that HCI-EC-23 is an estrogen- and progesterone-responsive cell line model that can be used to study the hormonal aspects of endometrial cancer.",

    "abstract": "The protein kinase (PK) superfamily constitutes one of the largest and most conserved protein families in eukaryotic genomes, comprising core components of signaling pathways in cell regulation. Despite its remarkable relevance, only a few kinase families have been studied in Hevea brasiliensis. A comprehensive characterization and global expression analysis of the PK superfamily, however, is currently lacking. In this study, with the aim of providing novel inferences about the mechanisms associated with the stress response developed by PKs and retained throughout evolution, we identified and characterized the entire set of PKs, also known as the kinome, present in the Hevea genome. A total of 1,809 PK genes were identified using the current reference genome assembly at the scaffold level, and 1,379 PK genes were identified using the latest chromosome-level assembly and combined into a single set of 2,842 PKs. These proteins were further classified into 20 different groups and 122 families, exhibiting high compositional similarities among family members and with two phylogenetically close species (Manihot esculenta and Ricinus communis). Different RNA-sequencing datasets were employed to identify tissue-specific expression patterns and potential correspondences between different rubber tree genotypes. In addition, coexpression networks under several abiotic stress conditions, such as cold, drought and latex overexploitation, were employed to elucidate associations between families and tissues/stresses. Through the joint investigation of tandemly duplicated kinases, transposable elements, gene expression patterns, and coexpression events, we provided insights into the understanding of the cell regulation mechanisms in response to several conditions, which can often lead to a significant reduction in rubber yield.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnregulated antimicrobial use is common in both hospital and community settings of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, discrete data regarding the use/misuse of antimicrobials at pharmacies in LMICs are limited. This study was conducted to understand the knowledge, attitude, and practice of pharmacy employees on antimicrobial dispensing in Nepal.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire on 801 pharmacy employees working in community and hospital pharmacies located in Lalitpur metropolitan city (LMC) of Kathmandu, Nepal between April 2017 and March 2019.\n\nResultsNot all respondents replied to all questions asked. A majority (92%, 738/801) of respondents agreed that the demand for non-prescription antimicrobials was common. Sixty nine percent (437/635) of participants responded that they would ask of prescription before dispensing. Suspected respiratory tract infection was the most common reason demanding for non-prescription antimicrobials, identified by 68% (535/792) of respondents. Azithromycin was the most commonly prescribed and sold antimicrobials, as reported by 46%, (361/787) and 48% (377/779) of participants respectively. A majority (87%; 696/800) of respondents agreed on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to be a global public health threat; 54% (429/796) perceived antimicrobial misuse to be an important driver of AMR, while only 39% (315/801) replied that judicious dispensing of antimicrobials can help curb AMR.\n\nConclusionOur study revealed that the unfounded dispensing and use of antimicrobials is prevalent among pharmacies in Kathmandu, Nepal. This overreliance on antimicrobials, notably azithromycin, may escalated the burden of AMR. We identified several drivers of inappropriate antimicrobial dispensing practice in pharmacies, which will aid public health authorities in addressing these issues. Further studies considering the role of other stakeholders, such as physicians, veterinarians, general public, and policy makers are required to obtain a more holistic perspectives on the practices of antimicrobial use so to curb the extant AMR crisis.",

    "abstract": "Subtle cognitive impairment can occur early in the course of Parkinsons disease (PD) and may manifest under different forms of executive dysfunction such as impaired cognitive flexibility. The precise contribution of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration to these non-motor features of the disease is poorly known. Whether such cognitive impairment associated with the disease process may also predate and contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric side-effects following dopamine replacement therapy remains largely unknown. To address these issues, we investigated the respective contributions of nigrostriatal degeneration and chronic treatment with the dopamine D3-preferring agonist pramipexole on behavioural flexibility in a rat model of PD. Flexible, intermediate and inflexible rats were identified based on baseline assessment of behavioural flexibility using an operant set-shifting task. Nigrostriatal degeneration was induced by bilateral viral-mediated expression of A53T mutated human -synuclein in the substantia nigra pars compacta and behavioural flexibility was assessed after induction of nigrostriatal degeneration, and during chronic pramipexole treatment. Nigrostriatal degeneration impaired behavioural flexibility in flexible but not in inflexible rats. Pramipexole induced a decrease of behavioural flexibility that was exacerbated in lesioned rats and in the most flexible individuals. Furthermore, the deficits induced by pramipexole in lesioned rats affected different components of the task between flexible and inflexible individuals. This study demonstrates that nigrostriatal degeneration and pramipexole unequally impair behavioural flexibility, suggesting that the susceptibility to develop non-motor impairments upon treatment initiation could primarily depend on premorbid differences in behavioural flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Galactic cosmic rays (GCR) in space induce increase in cerebral amyloid-{beta} levels and elevated levels of microgliosis and astrocytosis, causing accelerated neurodegeneration from this increased neuroinflammation. Even exposure to low-levels of high-Z high-energy (HZE) radiation (50 cGy) has been shown to induce biochemical and immunohistochemical changes in short-term leading to degradation in cognition, motor skills, and development of space-induced neuropathy. There is lack of effective neuroinflammation countermeasures, and current experimental therapies require invasive intracerebral and intrathecal delivery due to difficulty associated with therapeutic crossover between blood-brain barrier. Here, we present a new countermeasure development approach for neurotherapeutics using high-throughput drug-discovery, target validation, and lead molecule identification with nucleic acid-based molecules. These Nanoligomer molecules are rationally designed using a bioinformatics and AI-based ranking method and synthesized as a single-modality combining 6-different design elements to up- or down-regulate gene expression of target gene at will, resulting in elevated or diminished protein expression of intended target. This platform approach was used to perturb and identify most effective upstream regulators and canonical pathways for therapeutic intervention to reverse radiation-induced neuroinflammation. The lead Nanoligomer and corresponding target granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were identified using in vitro cell-based screening in human astrocytes and donor derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and further validated in vivo using a mouse model of radiation-induced neuroinflammation. GM-CSF transcriptional downregulator Nanoligomer 30D.443_CSF2 downregulated proinflammatory cytokine GM-CSF (or CSF2) using simple intraperitoneal injection of low-dose (3mg/kg) and completely reversed expression of CSF2 in cortex tissue, as well as other neuroinflammation markers. These results point to the broader applicability of this approach towards space countermeasure development, and potential for further investigation of lead neurotherapeutic molecule as a reversible gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Spatial working memory and image recognition tests are commonly used to facilitate the diagnosis of hippocampal-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimers disease due to their relatively high specificity and sensitivity to damage to the medial temporal lobes compared to standard commonly used clinical tests. Pathological changes in Alzheimers disease start years before the formal diagnosis is made, partially due to testing too late. To address this challenge, we developed a novel digital platform, hAge ( healthy Age), which integrates double spatial alternation, image recognition and visuospatial tasks for frequent remote unsupervised assessment of spatial and non-spatial working memory. 191 healthy adults (67% females, 18-81 years old) participated in the study. In line with findings using standard laboratory tests, we showed that performance on the spatial alternation task negatively correlated with inter-trial periods and performance levels on image recognition and visuospatial tasks can be controlled by varying image similarity. Importantly, we demonstrated that frequent engagement with the double spatial alternation task leads to a strong practice effect, previously identified as a potential measure of cognitive decline in MCI patients. Finally, we discuss how lifestyle and motivation confounds may present a serious challenge for cognitive assessment in real-world uncontrolled environments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChemosensory cues are vital for social and sexual behaviours and are primarily detected and processed by the vomeronasal system (VNS), whose plastic capacity has been investigated in mice. However, studying chemosensory plasticity outside of laboratory conditions may give a more realistic picture of how the VNS adapts to a changing environment. Rabbits are a well-described model of chemocommunication since the discovery of the rabbit mammary pheromone and their vomeronasal organ (VNO) transcriptome was recently characterized, a first step to further study plasticity-mediated transcriptional changes. In this study, we assess the plastic capacity of the rabbit male and female VNO under sex-separation vs sex-combined scenarios, including adults and juveniles, to determine whether the rabbit VNO is plastic and, if so, whether such plasticity is already established at early stages of life.\n\nResultsFirst, we characterized the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the VNO of rabbit male and female under sex-separation and compared it to sex-combined individuals, both in adults and juveniles, finding that differences between male and female were larger in a sex-separated scenario. Secondly, we analyzed the number of DEGs between sex-separated and sex-combined scenarios, both in males and females. In adults, both sexes showed a high number of DEGs while in juveniles only females showed differences. Additionally, the vomeronasal receptor genes were strikingly down-regulated in sex-separated adult females, whereas in juveniles up-regulation was shown for the same condition, suggesting a role of VRs in puberty onset. Finally, we described the environment-modulated plastic capacity of genes involved in reproduction, immunity and VNO functional activity, including G-protein coupled receptors.\n\nConclusionsOur results show that sex-separation induces sex- and stage- specific gene expression differences in the VNO of male and female rabbit, both in adults and juveniles. These results bring out for the first time the plastic capacity of the rabbit VNO, supporting its functional adaptation to specifically respond to a continuous changing environment. Finally, species-specific differences and individual variability should always be considered in VNO studies and overall chemocommunication research.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of the mammalian brain is orchestrated by temporally coordinated waves of gene expression. A key aspect of this developmental program is mediated at the post-transcriptional level by microRNAs (miRNAs). Deletion of neuronal enriched miRNAs induces strong developmental phenotypes, and multiple reports have found altered levels of miRNAs in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms used by miRNAs to instruct proper brain development remain largely unexplored.\n\nHere, through multiple screens, we identified miR-218 as a critical regulator of hippocampal assembly in mice. MiR-218 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and enriched in both excitatory principal neurons and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Transient inhibition of miR-218 in early life results in an adult brain with heightened network activity and a predisposition to seizures. We used RNA-seq and FACS-seq (fluorescence-activated cell sorting followed by RNA-seq) to identify global and cell type-specific changes in gene expression in the absence of miR-218 and narrow down which altered developmental processes would lead to long-term network instability. We find that miR-218 inhibition results in the disruption of early depolarizing GABAergic signaling, structural defects in dendritic spines, and altered intrinsic membrane excitability. Finally, conditional knockout of miR-218 in interneurons, but not pyramidal neurons is sufficient to recapitulate the effects on long-term stability. Taken together, the data suggest that miR-218 orchestrates hippocampal network assembly to produce a stable network in the adult, primarily by regulating interneuron function in early postnatal life.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new framework for understanding and modelling neurobiological extreme atypicalities for individual participants. We combine the strength of normative models, to make predictions for individual patients, with multivariate extreme value statistics, which allows us to model the outer centiles accurately, enabling accurate estimation of risk and detection of atypicality. In general, most statistical methods focus principally on estimating the mean of the distribution and are not appropriate to capture the tails of the distribution. We believe that the tails carry most of the information for predicting psychopathy in neurological and psychiatric disorders and should therefore be modelled carefully.\n\nIn the univariate case, we demonstrate how to fit a generalized Pareto distribution with the peaks over threshold method. For the multivariate case, we present a novel framework that allows us to capture the multivariate tails of the distribution fully. The model relies on the so-called tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM). The TPDM is similar to a covariance matrix, but specified for the tails. From the TPDM we can create a reduced basis of vectors that explain most of the structure underlying the extreme values. The method is similar to covariance principal component analysis, but uniquely made for the extreme values. To evaluate this framework, we use a range of neuroimaging-derived measures from the UK Biobank dataset, including structural, functional and diffusion image-derived phenotypes. We find that the first extreme principal component mostly consists of whole-brain volume and area measures and the second extreme principal component is mostly compromised of white matter tracts. We further demonstrate the link between extreme brain deviations in the individual from a reference cohort to behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Animals move their head and eyes as they explore and sample the visual scene. Previous studies have demonstrated neural correlates of head and eye movements in rodent primary visual cortex (V1), but the sources and computational roles of these signals are unclear. We addressed this by combining measurement of head and eye movements with high density neural recordings in freely moving mice. V1 neurons responded primarily to gaze shifts, where head movements are accompanied by saccadic eye movements, but not to head movements where compensatory eye movements stabilize gaze. A variety of activity patterns immediately followed gaze shifts, including units with positive, biphasic, or negative responses, and together these responses formed a temporal sequence following the gaze shift. These responses were greatly diminished in the dark for the vast majority of units, replaced by a uniform suppression of activity, and were similar to those evoked by sequentially flashed stimuli in head-fixed conditions, suggesting that gaze shift transients represent the temporal response to the rapid onset of new visual input. Notably, neurons responded in a sequence that matches their spatial frequency preference, from low to high spatial frequency tuning, consistent with coarse-to-fine processing of the visual scene following each gaze shift. Recordings in foveal V1 of freely gazing head-fixed marmosets revealed a similar sequence of temporal response following a saccade, as well as the progression of spatial frequency tuning. Together, our results demonstrate that active vision in both mice and marmosets consists of a dynamic temporal sequence of neural activity associated with visual sampling.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDuring free movement, neurons in mouse V1 respond to head movements that are accompanied by a gaze-shifting saccadic eye movement, but not a compensatory eye movement.\nC_LIO_LINeurons respond to gaze shifts with diverse temporal dynamics that form a sequence across the population, from early positive responses to biphasic and negative responses.\nC_LIO_LIIn darkness, most neurons show a uniform suppression following a gaze shift.\nC_LIO_LITemporal dynamics of responses correspond to a neurons temporal and spatial frequency preferences, consistent with a coarse-to-fine processing sequence.\nC_LIO_LIA similar temporal sequence following saccades is observed in foveal V1 of freely gazing head-fixed marmosets, demonstrating shared aspects of active visual processing across species.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Even experts can sometimes fail while performing fully learned movements. Do such failures suddenly arise, or are there any forecasting signs? It has been reported that the kinematics of the early phase of movements can predict the failure, and brain activity patterns specific to failures are observed just before the movement onset. The presence of abnormal brain activity patterns long before (> 30 s) a failure in a cognitive task leads us to question if signs of a failure in action could exist in trials preceding the failure. Here, we examined this question using a reaching movement adaptation paradigm conventionally used to test motor learning dynamics. Firstly, the presence of a behavioral sign that preceded failures was observed: the peak velocity of the reaching movement significantly decreased in the preceding two trials. Secondly, specific theta and alpha band activity of EEG were observed in the failure trials and the trials preceding the failure. These results suggest that a failure in actions does not occur suddenly, and some signs preceding failures can be observed in the prior trials. Our approach may pave the way to investigate how we prevent failures and improve motor performance.",

    "abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a pathogenic bacterium and the causative agent of Lyme Disease. It is exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both the vertebrate and tick hosts. While some mechanisms by which B. burgdorferi ameliorates the effects of ROS exposure have been studied, there are likely many other unknown mechanisms of ROS neutralization that contribute to virulence. Here, we follow up on a three gene cluster of unknown function, BB_0554, BB_0555, and BB_0556, that our prior unbiased transposon insertional sequencing studies implicated in both ROS survival and survival in Ixodes scapularis. We confirmed these findings through genetic knockout and provide evidence that these genes are co-transcribed as an operon to produce a xanthine dehydrogenase. In agreement with these results, we found that B. burgdorferi exposure to either uric acid (a downstream product of xanthine dehydrogenase) or allopurinol (an inhibitor of xanthine dehydrogenase) could modulate sensitivity to ROS in a BB_0554-BB_0556 dependent manner. Together, this study identifies a previously uncharacterized three gene operon in B. burgdorferi as a putative xanthine dehydrogenase critical for virulence.\n\nImportanceBorrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is highly successful at evading host immune defenses such as reactive oxygen species, despite minimal identified defenses against oxidative stress. We identified a putative xanthine dehydrogenase that is important in survival of the organism when exposed to oxidative stress and in both its tick and murine hosts. The mechanism appears based on a previously unrecognized role of uric acid in neutralizing reactive oxygen species and highlights how B. burgdorferi can utilize its very limited metabolic capabilities in unique ways.",

    "abstract": "The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is one of the most frequent and severe causes of nosocomial infection. This organism is also a major cause of airway infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Pa is known to have a remarkable metabolic plasticity, allowing it to thrive in diverse environmental conditions and ecological niches, yet little is known about the central metabolic pathways which sustain its growth during infection, or precisely how these pathways operate. In this work, we used a combination of  omics approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and 13C-fluxomics) and reverse genetics to provide a systems-level insight into how the infection-relevant organic acids, succinate and propionate, are metabolized by Pa. Moreover, through structural and kinetic analysis of the 2-methylcitrate synthase (PrpC) and its paralogue, citrate synthase (GltA), we show how these two crucial enzymatic steps are interconnected in Pa organic acid assimilation. We found that Pa can rapidly adapt to the loss of GltA function by acquiring mutations in a transcriptional repressor, which then de-represses prpC expression. Our findings provide a clear example of how  underground metabolism, facilitated by enzyme substrate promiscuity, \"rewires\" Pa metabolism, allowing it to overcome the loss of a crucial enzyme. This pathogen-specific knowledge is critical for the advancement of a model-driven framework to target bacterial central metabolism.",

We determined the structure of PilC, showing that it is a modular pilin with a lectin module binding a specific subset of glycans prevalent in the human glycome, the host of S. sanguinis. Altogether, our findings support a model whereby the minor pilins in S. sanguinis T4P form a tip-located complex promoting adhesion to various host receptors. Our findings have general implications for a group of minor pilins widely conserved in T4F.",

    "abstract": "As a consequence of the process of domestication, wild and domestic individuals are adapted to very different environmental conditions. Although the phenotypic consequences of domestication are observable, the genetic causes are not evident in many cases. Artificial selection could be modifying the selection coefficients of new and standing variation in the population under domestication. Here, we aim to detect a genome-wide signal of domestication under a model of polygenic adaptation. We use forward simulations to investigate the 1D and 2D site frequency spectra (SFS) of mutations in two populations (Wild and Domestic) with divergent histories (demographic and selective) following a domestication split. We simulate ten different scenarios, varying the strength of selection upon beneficial mutations and the proportion of mutations whose selection coefficients change after domestication. First, we describe that in domesticated populations selection at linked sites needs to be invoked to explain the SFS of neutral mutations and that the mode of linked selection affecting the neutral SFS depends on the duration of the domestication bottleneck. Second, we find that some aspects of the full distribution of fitness effects (DFE), such as the shape and strength of the deleterious DFE, are accurately estimated in both populations when using only the 1D-SFS. However, the detection of significant differences in the beneficial DFE between populations remains challenging in most, but not all simulated scenarios when only the 1D-SFS is used. Third, when considering the 2D-SFS and a new joint DFE model, we are able to detect more subtle differences in the full DFE that are hidden in the 1D-SFS analysis. In conclusion, our work highlights the strengths and limitations of detecting a polygenic signal of domestication under a variety of domestication scenarios and genetic architectures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAedes albopictus is a public health threat for its worldwide spread and ability to transmit arboviruses. Understanding mechanisms of mosquito immunity can provide new tools to control arbovirus spread. The genomes of Aedes mosquitoes contain hundreads of nonretroviral endogenous viral elements (nrEVEs), which are enriched in piRNA clusters and produce piRNAs, with the potential to target cognate viruses. Recently, one nrEVE was shown to limit cognate viral infection through nrEVE-derived piRNAs. These findings suggest that nrEVEs constitute an archive of past viral infection and that the landscape of viral integrations may be variable across populations depending on their viral exposure.\n\nMethodsWe used bioinformatics and molecular approaches to identify known and novel (i.e. absent in the reference genome) viral integrations in the genome of wild collected Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and characterize their virome.\n\nResultsWe showed that the landscape of viral integrations is dynamic with seven novel viral integrations being characterised, but does not correlate with the virome, which includes both viral species known and unknown to infect mosquitoes. However, the small RNA coverage profile of nrEVEs and the viral genomic contigs we identified confimed an interaction among these elements and the piRNA and siRNA pathways in mosquitoes.\n\nConclusionsMosquitoes nrEVEs have been recently descrived as a new form of heritable, sequence-specific mechanism of antiviral immunity. Our results contribute to understanding the dynamic distribution of nrEVEs in the genomes of wild Ae. albopictus and their interaction with mosquito viruses.",

The RNA origami method allows cotranscriptional folding of large RNA scaffolds that can position functional motifs in a precise manner, which has been verified by Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between fluorescent aptamers. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a promising method for characterizing the structure of larger RNA nanostructures. However, the structure of individual aptamers is difficult to solve by cryo-EM due to their low molecular weight. Here, we place aptamers on the RNA origami scaffolds to increase the contrast for cryo-EM and solve the structure of a new Broccoli-Pepper FRET pair. We identify different modes of ligand binding of the two aptamers and verify by selective probing. 3D variability analysis of the cryo-EM data show that the relative position between the two bound fluorophores on the origami fluctuate by only 3.5 Angstrom. Our results demonstrate the use of RNA origami scaffolds for characterizing small RNA motifs by cryo-EM and for positioning functional RNA motifs with high spatial precision.

    "abstract": "Blood flow within the left ventricle provides important information regarding cardiac function in health and disease. The mitral valve strongly influences the formation of flow structures and there exist various approaches for the representation of the valve in numerical models of left ventricular blood flow. However, a systematic comparison of the various mitral valve models is missing, making a priori decisions considering the overall models context of use impossible. Within this study, a benchmark setup to compare the influence of mitral valve modeling strategies on intraventricular flow features was developed. Then, five mitral valve models of increasing complexity: no modeling, static wall, 2D and 3D porous medium with time-dependent porosity, and one-way Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) were compared with each other. The flow features velocity, kinetic energy, transmitral pressure drop, vortex formation, flow asymmetry as well as computational cost and ease-of-implementation were evaluated. The one-way FSI approach provides the highest level of flow detail, which is accompanied by the highest numerical costs and challenges with the implementation. As an alternative, the porous medium approach with our new expansion including time-dependent porosity provides good results with up to 10% deviations in the flow features (except the transmitral pressure drop) in comparison to the FSI model and only a fraction (11%) of numerical costs. Taken together, our benchmark setup allows a quantitative comparison of various mitral valve modeling approaches and is provided to the scientific community for further testing and expansion..",

While phenotypic changes during short-term EMT induction are reversible, long-term EMT induction has been often associated with irreversibility. Here, we show that phenotypic changes seen in MCF10A cells upon long-term EMT induction by TGF{beta} need not be irreversible, but have relatively longer timescales of reversibility than those seen in short-term induction. Next, using a phenomenological mathematical model incorporating the epigenetic silencing of miR-200 by ZEB, we highlight how the epigenetic memory gained during long-term EMT induction can slow the recovery to the epithelial state post-TGF{beta} withdrawal. Our results suggest that epigenetic modifiers can govern the extent and timescale of EMT reversibility, and advise caution against labelling phenotypic changes seen in long-term EMT induction as  irreversible.",

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism is critical for insect reproduction, especially for species that invest heavily into early developmental stages of their offspring. The role of symbiotic bacteria during this process is unknown but likely essential, especially in the case of obligate microbes that fulfill key biological functions in the host. Using a combined lipidomics, functional genomics and biochemical strategy, we examined the role of lipid metabolism in the interaction between the viviparous tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans morsitans) and its obligate endosymbiotic bacteria (Wigglesworthia glossinidia) during tsetse pregnancy. We observed increased CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (cct1) expression during pregnancy. This gene codes for the enzyme that functions as the rate limiting step in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in the Kennedy pathway which is critical for stored lipid metabolism and progeny development. Experimental removal of Wigglesworthia impaired lipid metabolism via disruption of the Kennedy pathway, yielding obese mothers whose developing progeny ultimately starve. Functional validation via experimental cct1 suppression revealed a phenotype similar to females lacking obligate Wigglesworthia symbionts. These results indicate that, in Glossina, symbiont-derived factors, likely B vitamins, are critical for proper function of both lipid biosynthesis and lipolysis. Loss of the symbiosis has a dramatic impact on Glossina fecundity, and may be broadly applicable to other insect systems, particularly to species that require symbiotic partners to maximize lipolysis and reproductive output.",

    "abstract": "The germination niche of plant species depends primarily on the seeds responsiveness to temperature and water potential. However, to appreciate future climate risks to natural regeneration through germination, a global level synthesis across species is needed. We performed a meta-regression of primary data from 377 studies on 528 species, including trees, grasses, crops and wild species, to determine patterns and co-correlants in the cardinal values that define species germination niche. A negative correlation was found between thermal time and base temperature, and positive correlations between other cardinal temperatures and base temperature. Mean values of thermal time indicate that annual crops germinate more rapidly compared to wild species, potentially as a consequence of domestication, and tropical tree seeds the slowest. Dryland species (Cactaceae and Agavaceae) have the widest upper thermal and lower moisture niche, indicative of an ability to grow under harsh conditions, while forages have the narrowest thermal and moisture niche, suggesting higher sensitivity to frost or drought. We propose a new conceptual framework for understanding germination niche as shaped by thermal and moisture traits. Our database represents a unique source of information to further determine the vegetation boundaries of wild or cultivated species, including within simulation studies on plant species adaptations under changing land-use and climate.",

    "abstract": "Genetic design automation (GDA) tools hold promise to speed-up circuit design in synthetic biology. Their wide-spread adoption is hampered by their limited predictive power, resulting in frequent deviations between in-silico and in-vivo performance of a genetic circuit. Context-effects, i.e., the change in overall circuit functioning, due to the intracellular environment of the host and due to cross-talk among circuits components are believed to be a major source for the aforementioned deviations. Incorporating these effects in computational models of GDA tools is challenging but is expected to boost their predictive power, and hence, their deployment. Using fine-grained thermodynamic models of promoter activity we show in this work, how to account for two major components of cellular context effects: (i) Crosstalk due to limited specificity of used regulators and (ii) titration of circuit regulators to off-target binding sites on the host genome. We show, how we can compensate the incurred increase in computational complexity through dedicated branch-and-bound techniques during the technology mapping process. Using the synthesis of several combinational logic circuits based on Cellos device library as a case study, we analyze the effect of different intensities and distributions of crosstalk on circuit performance and on the usability of a given device library.",

    "abstract": "The brain combines information from multiple sensory modalities to interpret the environment. These processes, collectively known as multisensory integration, have been modeled as Bayesian causal inference, which proposes that perception involves the combination of information from different sensory modalities based on their reliability and their likelihood of stemming from the same causes in the outside world. Bayesian causal inference has explained a variety of multisensory effects in simple tasks but is largely untested in complex sensory scenes where multisensory integration can provide the most benefit. Recently, we presented data challenging the ideal Bayesian model from a new auditory spatial discrimination task in which spatially aligned visual stimuli improve performance despite providing no information about the correct response. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, despite deviating from the ideal observer, the influence of task-uninformative stimuli was still dependent on the reliabilities of auditory and visual cues. We reasoned shorter stimulus durations should lead to less reliable auditory spatial encoding, and hence stronger effects of more reliable visual cues, which are easily localized even at short durations. While our results replicated the effect from our previous study across a wide range of stimulus durations, we did not find a significant increase in effect size with shorter stimuli, leaving our principal question not fully answered.",

    "abstract": "Vision requires that we rotate our eyes frequently to look at informative structures in the scene. Eye movements are planned by the brain but their execution depends on the mechanical properties of the oculomotor plant, i.e, the arrangement of eyeball position, muscle insertions and pulley locations. Therefore, the biomechanics of rotations is sensitive to eyeball translation because it changes muscle levers. Eyeball translations are little researched as they are difficult to measure with conventional techniques. Here we study the effects of eyeball translation on the coordination of gaze rotation by high-speed MRI recordings of saccadic eye movements during blinks, which are known to produce strong translations. We found that saccades during blinks massively overshoot their targets, and that these overshoots occur in a transient fashion such that the eye is back on target at the time the blink ends. These dynamic overshoots were tightly coupled to the eyeball translation, both in time and in size. Saccades made without blinks were also accompanied by small amounts of transient eyeball retraction, the size of which scaled with saccade amplitude. These findings demonstrate the complex interaction between rotation and translation movements of the eye. The mechanical consequences of eyeball translation on oculomotor control should be considered along with the neural implementation in the brain to understand the generation of eye movements and their disorders.",

Here, we used a valproic acid-induced ASD marmoset model and in vivo two-photon microscopy to investigate the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in ASD core symptoms. In model marmosets compared to controls, spine turnover was upregulated and spines were actively generated in clusters. Clustered emerging spines were predominant in carryover of generated spines in the model marmosets. Presynaptic boutons of local axons, but not long-range commissural axons, showed hyperdynamic turnover. Furthermore, nasal oxytocin administration reduced the clustered emergence of spines. Finally, we confirmed the high molecular conformity of adult animal models with human ASD.

Mutations in the kinesin motor protein gene KIF1C cause Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, an autosomal recessive disease leading to predominant degeneration of the long axons of central motoneurons. In this study we aimed to gain insight into the molecular function of KIF1C and understand how KIF1C dysfunction contributes to motoneuron degeneration.\n\nWe used affinity proteomics in neuronally differentiated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) to identify the protein complex associated with KIF1C in neuronal cells; candidate interactions were then validated by immunoprecipitation and mislocalization of putative KIF1C cargoes was studied by immunostainings.\n\nWe found KIF1C to interact with all core components of the exon junction complex (EJC); expression of mutant KIF1C in neuronal cells leads to loss of the typical localization distally in neurites. Instead, EJC core components accumulate in the pericentrosomal region, here co-localizing with mutant KIF1C. These findings suggest KIF1C as a neuronal transporter of the EJC. Interestingly, the binding of KIF1C to the EJC is RNA-mediated, as treatment with RNAse prior to immunoprecipitation almost completely abolishes the interaction. Silica-based solid-phase extraction of UV-crosslinked RNA-protein complexes furthermore supports direct interaction of KIF1C with RNA, as recently also demonstrated for kinesin heavy chain. Taken together, our findings are consistent with a model where KIF1C transports mRNA in an EJC-bound and therefore transcriptionally silenced state along neurites, thus providing the missing link between the EJC and mRNA localization in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is caused by the extracellular pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick. Approximately one-third of infected individuals develop arthritis of weight-bearing joints, though it is unclear why some patients develop arthritis and severe systemic disease while others do not. C57BL/6 (B6) mice are susceptible to Bb infection but do not develop arthritis, providing an in vivo model to evaluate mechanisms regulating development of Lyme arthritis. We demonstrate here that co-infection of B6 mice with the tick-borne pathogens Bb and Ehrlichia muris (Em) induced significant arthritis. Although co-infection did not impact bacterial burden or growth of either pathogen, the resultant Lyme arthritis in co-infected mice correlated with significant hematologic disturbances. Whereas single Bb infection elicited no overt hematologic changes, Em infection resulted in thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, monocytosis, and granulocytosis, which was consistently observed in mice co-infected with both Bb and Em. Hematologic changes correlated with profound changes to the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations in Em-infected mice. Most notable were dramatic reductions in populations of HSPCs committed to myeloid-biased differentiation. Co-infection resulted in persistent hematologic changes and bone marrow inflammation. Our data demonstrate for the first time that B6 mice, resistant to developing Lyme arthritis, exhibit severe joint pathology in the presence of a second pathogen, correlating with persistent emergency myelopoiesis. Our data support the conclusion that pathogen burden is not sufficient for disease and specific inflammatory signals and cells regulate the development of Lyme arthritis.\n\nImportanceTick-borne illnesses, historically relegated to specific geographic areas, are increasing in prevalence and distribution. Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness in North America, characterized by debilitating arthritis, carditis, and neurologic complications. It remains unclear why certain infected individuals develop severe disease while others are only mildly symptomatic. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is another tick-borne disease that often results in profound illness and severe hematological disturbances. We show here that co-infection of B6 mice, resistant to Lyme arthritis, with Borrelia burgdorferi and Ehrlichia muris, used to model HME, results in the development of severe arthritis and emergency myelopoiesis. Our work suggests that immune activation driven by co-infection contributes to the development of Lyme arthritis.",

    "abstract": "The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Shigella flexneri remains largely unknown. To understand the impact of the gut microbiota on S. flexneri virulence, we examined the effect of interspecies interactions with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt), a prominent member of the gut microbiota, on S. flexneri invasion. When grown in Bt conditioned medium, S. flexneri showed reduced invasion of human epithelial cells. This decrease in invasiveness of S. flexneri resulted from a reduction in the level of S. flexneris master virulence regulator VirF. Reduction of VirF corresponded with a decrease in expression of a secondary virulence regulator virB, as well as expression of S. flexneri virulence genes required for invasion, intracellular motility, and spread. Repression of S. flexneri virulence factors by Bt conditioned medium was not caused by either a secreted metabolite or protein, but rather, was due to the presence of Bt outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in the conditioned medium. The addition of purified Bt OMVs to S. flexneri growth medium recapitulated the inhibitory effects of Bt conditioned medium on invasion, virulence gene expression, and virulence protein levels. Total lipids extracted from either Bt cells or Bt OMVs also recapitulated the effects of Bt condition medium on expression of the S. flexneri virulence factor IpaC, indicating that Bt OMV lipids, rather than a cargo contained in the vesicles, are the active factor responsible for the inhibition of S. flexneri virulence.\n\nImportanceShigella flexneri is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery in humans. Shigella spp. are one of the leading causes of diarrheal morbidity and mortality, especially among children in low and middle-income countries. The rise of antimicrobial resistance combined with the lack of an effective vaccine for Shigella heightens the importance of studies aimed at better understanding previously uncharacterized aspects of Shigella pathogenesis. Here, we show that conditioned growth medium from the commensal bacteria Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron represses the invasion of S. flexneri. This repression is due to the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron outer membrane vesicles. These findings establish a role for interspecies interactions with a prominent member of the gut microbiota in modulating the virulence of S. flexneri and identify a novel function of outer membrane vesicles in interbacterial signaling between members of the gut microbiota and an enteric pathogen.",

Due to the similarities between fungal and human cells, the lack of fungal-specific targets has become the major hurdle for antifungal discovery. Many fungi, including the deadly human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, are found in soil, where they compete with other microorganisms, including bacteria. However, most bacteria that inhibit fungal growth are pathogens and their antifungal effects strictly rely on cell-cell contact. Here we show that Myxococcus xanthus, a nonpathogenic, soil-dwelling bacterium, efficiently eliminates C. neoformans and strongly inhibits the production of fungal virulence factors. Remarkably, these antifungal activities do not require cell-cell contact. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that M. xanthus increases the permeability of C. neoformans cells. Our results on the cross-kingdom interaction between M. xanthus and C. neoformans will reveal fundamental mechanisms for bacterial-fungal interactions and suggest novel strategies for antifungal therapies.",

Evidence suggests that IBD is associated with alterations in gut microbial composition, but further research is needed in veterinary medicine. The impact of IBD treatment on the gut microbiome needs to be better understood, especially in a breed-specific form of IBD in Yorkshire Terriers known as Yorkshire Terrier Enteropathy (YTE). This study aimed to investigate the difference in gut microbiome composition between YTE dogs during disease and remission and healthy Yorkshire Terriers. Our results showed a significant increase in specific taxa such as Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Escherichia-Shigella, and Streptococcus, and a decrease in Bacteroides, Prevotella, Alloprevotella, and Phascolarctobacterium in YTE dogs compared to healthy controls. No significant difference was found between the microbiome of dogs in remission and those with active disease, suggesting that the gut microbiome is affected beyond clinical recovery.",

The development and maturation of the enthesis involve cellular processes likened to an arrested growth plate. In this study, we explored the role of fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9), a known regulator of chondrogenesis and vascularization during bone development, on the structure and function of the postnatal enthesis. First, we confirmed spatial expression of Fgf9 in wildtype tendon and enthesis using in situ hybridization. We then used Cre recombinase driven by the scleraxis promoter (ScxCre) to conditionally inactivate Fgf9 in mouse tendon and enthesis. Characterization of enthesis morphology and mechanical properties in Fgf9ScxCre and wildtype (WT) entheses showed a smaller calcaneal and humeral apophyses, thinner cortical bone at the attachment, increased cellularity, and reduced failure load in mature entheses in Fgf9ScxCre compared to WT littermates. During postnatal development, we found reduced chondrocyte hypertrophy and disrupted type X collagen (Col X) in Fgf9ScxCre entheses. These findings support a model in which tendon-derived Fgf9 regulates the functional development of the enthesis, including its postnatal mineralization.",

    "abstract": "As species ranges shift in response to human-induced global changes, species interactions are expected to play a large role in shaping the resultant range dynamics and, subsequently, the composition of modified species assemblages. Most research on the impact of species interactions on range dynamics focuses on the effects of trophic interactions and exploitative competition for resources, but an emerging body of work shows that interspecific competition for territories and mates also affects species range shifts. As such, it is paramount to build a strong understanding of how these forms of behavioural interference between species impact landscape-scale patterns. Here, we examine recent (1997-2019) range dynamics of North American passerines to test the hypothesis that behavioural interference impacts the ease with which species move across landscapes. Over this 22-year period, we found that fine-scale spatial overlap between species (syntopy) increased more for species pairs that engage in interspecific territoriality than for those that do not. We found no evidence, however, for an effect of reproductive interference (hybridisation) on syntopy, and no effect of either type of interference on range-wide overlap (sympatry). Examining the net effects of species interactions on continent-scale range shifts may require species occurrence data spanning longer time periods than are currently available for North American passerines, but our results show that interspecific territoriality has had an overall stabilising influence on species coexistence over the past two decades.",

    "abstract": "Birth weight (BW), as a proxy for intrauterine growth, is influenced by both fetal and maternal genetic factors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region in both maternal and fetal genomes have been robustly associated with BW in previous genetic association studies suggesting the involvement of classical HLA alleles in BW etiology. However, no study to date has partitioned the association between BW and classical HLA alleles into maternal and fetal components. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to estimate the indirect maternal (i.e. via the intrauterine environment) and direct fetal effects of classical HLA alleles on BW. Our SEM leverages the data structure of the UK Biobank (UKB), which includes participants own BW and/or the BW of their firstborn child (in the case of UKB females). We show via simulation that our model yields asymptotically unbiased estimates of the maternal and fetal allelic effects on BW and appropriate type I error rates, in contrast to simple regression models that estimate unconditioned maternal and fetal effects. Asymptotic power calculations show that we have sufficient power to detect moderate-sized maternal or fetal allelic effects (standardized effect size [&ge;] 0.01) of common HLA alleles on BW in the UKB. Applying our SEM to imputed classical HLA alleles and own and offspring BW of [~]270,000 participants from the UKB replicated the previously reported association at the HLA-C locus (C*04:01, P = 2.13x10-7, C*05:01, P= 6.91x10-5, C*03:03, P= 4.53x10-3, respectively) and revealed strong evidence for maternal (HLA-A*03:01, P = 7.90x10-8; B*35:01, P = 7.78x10-5; B*39:06, P = 8.49 x10-5) and fetal allelic effects (HLA-B*39:06, P = 4.03x10-4) of non-HLA-C alleles on BW. These novel allelic associations between BW and classical HLA alleles provide insight into the immunogenetics of fetal growth in utero.",

Model evaluation is performed with a deep learning-based model-local map assessment score, DAQ, which we developed recently. Then, the subsequent local refinement is performed by a modified procedure of AlphaFold2, where we provide a trimmed template and trimmed multiple sequence alignment as input to control which structure regions to refine while leaving other more confident regions in the model intact. A benchmark study showed that our protocol, DAQ-refine, consistently improves low-quality regions of initial models. Among about 20 refined models generated for an initial structure, DAQ score was able to identify most accurate models.

The herbicide atrazine is an endocrine disruptor shown to have detrimental effects on reproduction across a number of vertebrate species.\n\nOBJECTIVESTo determine whether exposure to low levels of atrazine impairs meiosis in female mammals using a mouse model; in particular, whether and how the fidelity of oocyte chromosome segregation is affected, and whether the aging-related aneuploidy is exacerbated.\n\nMETHODSFemale C57BL/6J mice were exposed to two levels of atrazine in drinking water, with the lower level corresponding to detected environmental contamination. To model exposure during development, atrazine was ingested by pregnant females at 0.5 days post coitum and continued until pups were weaned at 21 days post-partum. For adult exposure, 2-month-old females ingested atrazine for 3 months. For each exposure group, various indicators of oocyte quality were determined, including developmental capacity and chromosomal abnormalities during the two meiotic divisions.\n\nRESULTSDevelopmental exposure caused only minor effects on the fetal events of meiotic prophase-I and establishment of initial follicle pools. However, ovulation was enhanced while oocyte quality was significantly reduced. At the chromosome level, misalignment and numerical and structural abnormalities were increased at both meiotic divisions. Furthermore, fertilization efficiency was impaired in vitro, and apoptosis was elevated in blastocysts derived from the eggs of atrazine-exposed females. Similar levels of chromosomal defects were seen in oocytes following both developmental and adult exposure regimens suggesting that quiescent primordial follicles may be the consequential targets of atrazine. Importantly, defects were observed long after exposure was terminated. Moreover, dramatic increases in chromosomally abnormal oocytes were seen in older mice indicating that atrazine exposure during development exacerbates the effects of maternal aging on oocyte quality. Indeed, analogous to the effects of maternal age, atrazine exposure resulted in weakened cohesion between sister chromatids.\n\nCONCLUSIONLow-level atrazine exposure causes persistent changes to the female mammalian germline with potential consequences for reproductive lifespan and congenital disease.",

Here we evaluated a range of transfer learning or pre-training strategies to create useful MRI representations for downstream tasks that lack large amounts of training data, such as Alzheimers disease (AD) classification. To test our proposed pre-training strategies, we analyzed 4,098 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and independently validated with an out-of-distribution test set of 600 scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS3) cohort for detecting AD. First, we trained 3D and 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We tested combinations of multiple pre-training strategies based on (1) supervised, (2) contrastive learning, and (3) self-supervised learning - using pre-training data within versus outside the MRI domain. In our experiments, the 3D CNN pre-trained with contrastive learning provided the best overall results - when fine-tuned on T1-weighted scans for AD classification - outperformed the baseline by 2.8% when trained with all of the training data from ADNI. We also show test performance as a function of the training dataset size and the chosen pre-training method. Transfer learning offered significant benefits in low data regimes, with a performance boost of 7.7%. When the pre-trained model was used for AD classification, we were able to visualize an improved clustering of test subjects diagnostic groups, as illustrated via a uniform manifold approximation (UMAP) projection of the high-dimensional model embedding space. Further, saliency maps indicate the additional activation regions in the brain scan using pre-training, that then maximally contributed towards the final prediction score.",

    "abstract": "1.Social learning (learning from others) can be a cost-effective way of gaining information compared to asocial (independent) learning. However, learning from others indiscriminately can lead to the acquisition of maladaptive behaviours or outdated information. Evolutionary theory therefore predicts that individuals will use social information adaptively through the use of  social learning strategies. Restrictive laboratory conditions, however, make studying human learning strategies problematic. Abstract tasks, unrealistic sources of social information and methodologies that do not take into account the influence of physical location over large spaces make it difficult to ascertain if previous findings are representative of the way we would use social information in reality. Here I describe a novel platform for studying human social behaviour within immersive virtual environments: \"Virtual Environments for Research into Social Evolution\" (VERSE). Through the use of gaming technology, VERSE allows researchers to build realistic, three-dimensional, open world environments where participants can complete ecologically relevant tasks while actively observing computer-controlled artificial intelligence agents (AIs) that act as realistic yet controllable sources of social information. This methodological article begins by exploring what social learning strategies are and the problems with studying social learning behaviour in humans (compared to animal populations, for example). I then discuss how gaming technology can be used in behavioural research and follow on with a detailed account of the specific functionalities available in VERSE. I conclude with a worked example of how VERSE can be used to construct a novel behavioural experiment. Altogether, VERSE has great potential to give us insight into how human individuals learn within novel environments in a way that has never before been possible.",

    "abstract": "DNA data storage is an emerging technology that has the potential to replace bulky, fragile and energy-intensive current digital data storage media. Here, we report a storage strategy called DNA Drive, that organizes data on long double stranded replicative DNA molecules. The DNA Drive has unlimited storage capacity, and its encoding scheme ensures the biosafety of the process by limiting the potential of the DNA sequence to code for mRNA and proteins. Using our approach, we encoded two historical texts from the French Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 and the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen published in 1791. In contrast to previous DNA storage strategies, the biocompatibility of the DNA Drive enables biological manipulation of the data including low cost copy.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe DNA Drive is a biosafe and biocompatible DNA data storage strategy with unlimited storage capacity.",

Random forests (RF)-based classifiers for fresh produce safety and quality using 7-mer hash datasets had significantly higher classification accuracy than those using the ASV datasets. We also demonstrated that the proposed combination of integrating multiple datasets and leveraging an alignment-free 7-mer hash strategy leads to better classification performance for fresh produce safety and quality.

    "abstract": "Upon entry into a new host cell, the HIV-1 capsid performs multiple essential functions, which include shielding the genome from innate immune sensors1, promoting reverse transcription2 and transporting the core from the entry site at the plasma membrane to the integration site inside the nucleus3,4. The HIV-1 capsid is a fullerene cone made of hexamers and pentamers of the viral CA protein5,6. The two types of capsomers are quasi-equivalent, with the same structural elements mediating distinct inter-subunit contacts. In other studied quasi-equivalent viruses, the capacity of genetically identical subunits to form hexamers and pentamers is conferred by molecular switches. Such a switch has not been previously found in retroviral CA proteins. Here, we report cryoEM structures of the HIV-1 CA pentamer within assembled in vitro capsids at nominal resolutions of 2.4-3.4 [A]. Comparison with the hexamer identified an internal loop that adopts distinct conformations, 310 helix in the pentamer and random coil in the hexamer. Designed manipulations of the coil/helix configuration allowed us to control pentamer and hexamer formation in a predictable manner, thus proving its function as a molecular switch. Importantly, the switch controls not only fullerene cone assembly, but also the capsids capacity to bind post-entry host factors that are critical for viral replication. Furthermore, the switch forms part of the binding site of the new ultra-potent HIV-1 inhibitor, lenacapavir. These studies reveal that a critical assembly element also controls the post-assembly functions of the capsid, and provide new insights on capsid inhibition and uncoating.",

We showed previously that Btk is activated by PH-TH dimerization, which is triggered on membranes by the phosphatidyl inositol phosphate PIP3, or in solution by hexakisinositol phosphate (IP6) (Wang et al. 2015, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06074). We now report that the ubiquitous adaptor protein growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) binds to and substantially increases the activity of PIP3-bound Btk on membranes. Using reconstitution on supported-lipid bilayers, we find that Grb2 can be recruited to membrane-bound Btk through interaction with the proline-rich linker in Btk. This interaction requires intact Grb2, containing both SH3 domains and the SH2 domain, but does not require that the SH2 domain be able to bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues - thus Grb2 bound to Btk is free to interact with scaffold proteins via the SH2 domain. We show that the Grb2-Btk interaction recruits Btk to scaffold-mediated signaling clusters in reconstituted membranes. Our findings indicate that PIP3-mediated dimerization of Btk does not fully activate Btk, and that Btk adopts an autoinhibited state at the membrane that is released by Grb2.",

    "abstract": "To reach their final destinations, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of gram-negative bacteria undertake an eventful journey beginning in the cytosol. Multiple molecular machines, chaperones, proteases, and other enzymes facilitate the translocation and assembly of OMPs. These helpers usually associate, often transiently, forming large protein assemblies. They are not well-understood due to experimental challenges in capturing and characterizing protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially transient ones. Using AF2Complex, we introduce a high-throughput, deep learning pipeline to identify PPIs within the E. coli cell envelope and apply it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1,500 envelope proteins, we find not only expected interactions but also unexpected ones with profound implications. Subsequently, we predict atomic structures for these protein complexes. These structures, typically of high confidence, explain experimental observations, and lead to mechanistic hypotheses for how a chaperone assists a nascent, precursor OMP emerging from a translocon, how another chaperone prevents it from aggregating and docks to an {beta}-barrel assembly port, and how a protease performs quality control. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways by using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.",

    "abstract": "Riboswitches are cis-regulatory RNA elements that regulate gene expression in response to ligand through the coordinated action of a ligand-binding aptamer domain (AD) and a downstream expression platform (EP). Previous studies of transcriptional riboswitches have uncovered diverse examples that utilize cotranscriptional strand displacement to mediate the switching mechanism. The coupling of transcription and translation in bacteria motivates the intriguing question as to whether translational riboswitches can utilize the same mechanistic features. Here we investigate this question by studying the Escherichia coli thiB thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch. Using cellular gene expression assays, we first confirmed that the riboswitch acts at the level of translational regulation. Deletion mutagenesis showed the importance of the AD-EP linker sequence for riboswitch function, which based on sequence complementarity with the AD P1 stem suggested the possibility of an intermediate structure reminiscent of transcriptional riboswitches that exploit strand displacement. Point mutation analysis of this intermediate structure, followed by designed changes to P1, supported a strand displacement mechanism for E. coli thiB. This work provides an important new example of diverse riboswitch AD-EP combinations that exploit this switching mechanism.",

Therefore, policies and science-based solutions are indispensable for monitoring threats to the most impacted species. In such effort, the analysis of elasmobranchs environmental traces via eDNA metabarcoding represent a candidate tool for effective monitoring and conservation that is often advocated to be cost-effective and easily replicated. Here, we tested a realistic approach to monitor future changes through elasmobranchs metabarcoding with published primers, in which, elasmobranch diversity from the coastal waters of the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (Brazil) was studied here. We detected a total of three elasmobranch species, namely Hypanus berthalutzae, Ginglymostoma cirratum, and Prionace glauca among numerous other fish species. Even though the technique proved to be a useful tool, some practical constraints were identified, and primarily caused by currently published environmental primers. In order to ensure the broad application of the method, we pointed out feasible adjustments to the problematic parameters based on our survey and other elasmobranch metabarcoding studies. The current drawbacks of the approach need to be considered by managers, conservation actors, and researchers, who are considering this methodology in order to avoid unrealistic promises for the cost incurred.",

Catalytic assay results reveal that ME3 is a non-allosteric enzyme and does not require modulators for activity while structural analysis suggests that the inner stability of ME3 domain A relative to ME2 disables allostery in ME3.

    "abstract": "Detection of sex pheromones of insects relies on the antennae. The female pheromone signal transmission in the male antennae ultimately initiates the courtship and mating behaviors of males. To investigate the proteins and metabolites involved in this neural transduction, the study adopted integrative proteomics and metabolomics analysis including tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic quantification and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics for comparing proteomic and metabolic changes between the antennae of male moths following stimulation by females and the non-stimulated males of A. pernyi. A total of 92 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) containing 52 up-regulated and 40 down-regulated proteins and 545 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) including 218 up- and 327 down-regulated metabolites were identified from the antennae of female-stimulated male moths based on the proteome and metabolome data, respectively. GO enrichment analysis showed that 45 DEPs could be enriched into different GO terms on different levels. COG analysis indicated that 61 DEPs were assigned to 20 functional categories. The 160 DEMs respectively fell into 11 and 44 classes at SuperClass and Class levels based on HMDB annotation. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that totally 43 DEMs were enriched into 6, 27, and 87 pathways on level 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A number of DEPs and DEMs related to neural transmission of female pheromone signals in the male antennae of A. pernyi were screened, including tyrosine hydroxylase, cryptochrome-1, tachykinin, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, cadherin-23, glutathione S-transferase delta 3, tyramine, tryptamine, n-oleoyl dopamine, n-stearoyl dopamine, and n-stearoyl tyrosine. We concluded that the altered expression levels of those proteins or metabolites were involved in regulating the neuron activity for enhanced transmission of neural impulses and continuous perception, reception, and transduction of female pheromone signals. Our findings yielded novel insights into the potential molecular mechanisms in the antennae of male A. pernyi responding to female attraction.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) have long been implicated in processes critical to embryonic development, such as cell survival, migration, and differentiation. Several mouse models of organ development ascribe a prosurvival requirement specifically to FGF8. Here, we explore the potential role of prosurvival FGF8 signaling in kidney development. We have previously demonstrated that conditional deletion of Fgf8 in the mesodermal progenitors that give rise to the kidney leads to renal aplasia in the mutant neonate. Deleterious consequences caused by loss of FGF8 begin to manifest by E14.5 when massive aberrant cell death occurs in the cortical nephrogenic zone in the rudimentary kidney as well as in the renal vesicles that give rise to the nephrons. To rescue cell death in the Fgf8 mutant kidney, we inactivate the genes encoding the pro-apoptotic factors BAK and BAX. In a wild-type background, the loss of Bak and Bax abrogates normal cell death and has minimal effect on renal development. However, in Fgf8 mutants, the combined loss of Bak and Bax rescues aberrant cell death in the kidneys and restores some measure of kidney development: 1) the nephron progenitor population is greatly increased; 2) some glomeruli form, which are rarely observed in Fgf8 mutants; and 3) kidney size is rescued by about 50% at E18.5. The development of functional nephrons, however, is not rescued. Thus, FGF8 signaling is required for nephron progenitor survival by regulating BAK / BAX and for subsequent steps involving, as yet, undefined roles in kidney development.",

    "abstract": "Honeycrisp is one of the most valuable apple cultivars grown in the United States and a popular breeding parent due to its superior fruit quality traits, high levels of cold hardiness, and disease resistance. However, it suffers from a number of physiological disorders and is susceptible to production and postharvest issues. Although several apple genomes have been sequenced in the last decade, there is still a substantial knowledge gap in understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying cultivar-specific traits. Here we present a fully phased, chromosome-level genome of  Honeycrisp apples, using PacBio HiFi, Omni-C, and Illumina sequencing platforms. Our genome assembly is by far the most contiguous among all the apple genomes. The sizes of the two assembled haplomes are 674 Mb and 660 Mb, with contig N50s of 32.8 Mb and 31.6 Mb, respectively. In total, 47,563 and 48,655 protein coding genes were annotated from each haplome, capturing 96.8-97.4% complete BUSCOs in the eudicot database, the most complete among all Malus annotations. A gene family analysis using seven Malus genomes shows that a vast majority of  Honeycrisp genes are assigned into orthogroups shared with other genomes, but it also reveals 121  Honeycrisp-specific orthogroups. We provide a valuable resource for understanding the genetic basis of horticulturally important traits in apples and other related tree fruit species, including at-harvest and postharvest fruit quality, abiotic stress tolerance, and disease resistance, all of which can enhance breeding efforts in Rosaceae.",

    "abstract": "We previously described a mouse model, tg66, with a severe defect resulting in diminished thymic size and complete involution by early adulthood. In the current study, we identified overexpression of Jagged1 as a mechanism for the alterations in thymic development in tg66 mice. T cells in the tg66 thymus were skewed towards CD8+ T cells, and within the CD4+ T cell compartment there was an over-representation of Foxp3+ cells. Regulatory Foxp3+ T cells (Tregs) isolated from tg66 mice had increased ST2 and CD103 expression. These Tregs could suppress proliferation to the same extent as conventional Tregs. Corroborating these results, tg66 mice were resistant to experimental induction of neuroinflammation in a common animal model for multiple sclerosis (EAE). Using bone marrow chimeras, we recorded a stark reduction in the number of thymocytes and a corresponding increase in Tregs in the thymus of mice receiving tg66 bone marrow. Conversely, through blocking Jagged1, the number of thymocytes was significantly increased, being concomitantly associated with a drop in the frequency of Tregs. We conclude that Tregs may play a role in thymic involution and could explain early thymic involution or loss as it is observed in diseases of thymic atrophy such as Down syndrome.",

It is unclear how NRXN1 deletions impact cortical development in a cell type-specific manner and disease background modulates these phenotypes. Here, we leveraged human pluripotent stem cell-derived forebrain organoid models carrying NRXN1 heterozygous deletions in isogenic and SCZ patient genetic backgrounds and conducted single-cell transcriptomic analysis over the course of brain organoid development from 3 weeks to 3.5 months. Intriguingly, while both deletions similarly impacted molecular pathways associated with ubiquitin-proteasome system, alternative splicing, and synaptic signaling in maturing glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, SCZ-NRXN1 deletions specifically perturbed developmental trajectories of early neural progenitors and accumulated disease-specific transcriptomic signatures. Using calcium imaging, we found that both deletions led to long-lasting changes in spontaneous and synchronous neuronal networks, implicating synaptic dysfunction. Our study reveals developmental-timing- and cell-type-dependent actions of NRXN1 deletions in unique genetic contexts.",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar climbing fibers (CFs) convey sensorimotor information and their errors, which are used for motor control and learning. Furthermore, they represent reward-related information. Despite such functional diversity of CF signals, it is still unclear whether each CF conveys the information of single or multiple modalities and how the CFs conveying different information are distributed over the cerebellar cortex. We performed two-photon calcium imaging from cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in mice engaged in a voluntary forelimb lever-pull task and demonstrated that CF responses in 93% of PCs could be explained by the combination of multiple behavioral variables, such as lever movement, licking, and reward delivery. Neighboring PCs exhibited similar CF response properties, formed functional clusters, and shared noise fluctuations of responses. Taken together, individual CFs convey behavioral information on multiplex variables and are spatially organized into the functional modules of the cerebellar cortex.",

A detailed analysis and validation of expressed TCR alpha, beta, gamma, and delta genes in 45 donors from 4 human populations: African, East Asian, South Asian, and European, revealed a total of 175 novel TCR variable and junctional alleles. The majority of novel alleles contained coding changes and were present at widely differing frequencies in the populations, a finding confirmed using DNA samples and sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project. Importantly, we identified three Neanderthal-derived, introgressed TCR regions, including a highly divergent novel TRGV4 variant, present in all archaic assemblies, that was frequent in all modern Eurasian population groups. Our results demonstrate significant variation in TCR genes at both individual and population levels, providing a strong incentive for including allelic variation in studies of TCR function in human biology.",

    "abstract": "The prevalent  core phonological deficit model of dyslexia proposes that the reading and spelling difficulties characterizing affected children stem from prior developmental difficulties in processing speech sound structure, for example perceiving and identifying syllable stress patterns, syllables, rhymes and phonemes. Yet spoken word production appears normal. This suggests an unexpected disconnect between speech input and speech output processes. Here we investigated the output side of this disconnect from a speech rhythm perspective by measuring the speech amplitude envelope (AE) of multisyllabic spoken phrases. The speech AE contains crucial information regarding stress patterns, speech rate, tonal contrasts and intonational information. We created a novel computerized speech copying task in which participants copied aloud familiar spoken targets like \"Aladdin\". Seventy-five children with and without dyslexia were tested, some of whom were also receiving an oral intervention designed to enhance multi-syllabic processing. Similarity of the childs productions to the target AE was computed using correlation and mutual information metrics. Similarity of pitch contour, another acoustic cue to speech rhythm, was used for control analyses. Children with dyslexia were significantly worse at producing the multi-syllabic targets as indexed by both similarity metrics for computing the AE. However, children with dyslexia were not different from control children in producing pitch contours. Accordingly, the spoken production of multisyllabic phrases by children with dyslexia is atypical regarding the AE. Children with dyslexia may not appear to listeners to exhibit speech production difficulties because their pitch contours are intact.\n\nResearch HighlightsO_LISpeech production of syllable stress patterns is atypical in children with dyslexia.\nC_LIO_LIChildren with dyslexia are significantly worse at producing the amplitude envelope of multi-syllabic targets compared to both age-matched and reading-level-matched control children.\nC_LIO_LINo group differences were found for pitch contour production between children with dyslexia and age-matched control children.\nC_LIO_LIIt may be difficult to detect speech output problems in dyslexia as pitch contours are relatively accurate.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "One critical feature of childrens cognition is their relatively immature attention. Decades of research have shown that childrens attentional abilities mature slowly over the course of development, including the ability to filter out distracting information. Despite such rich behavioral literature, little is known about how developing attentional abilities modulate neural representations in children. This information is critical to understanding exactly how attentional development shapes the way children process information. One intriguing possibility is that attention might be less likely to impact neural representations in children as compared with adults. In particular, representations of attended items may be less likely to be sharpened relative to unattended items in children as compared to adults. To investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity using fMRI while adults (21-31 years) and children (7-9 years) performed a one-back working memory task in which they were directed to attend to either motion direction or an object in a complex display where both were present. We used multivoxel pattern analysis and compared decoding accuracy of attended and unattended information. Consistent with attentional sharpening, we found higher decoding accuracy for task-relevant information (i.e., objects in the object-attended condition) than for task-irrelevant information (i.e., motion in the object-attended condition) in adults visual cortices. However, in childrens visual cortices, both task-relevant and task-irrelevant information were decoded equally well. Whats more, exploratory whole-brain analysis showed that the children represent task-irrelevant information more than adults in multiple regions across the brain, including the prefrontal cortex. These findings show that 1) attention does not sharpen neural representations in the child visual cortex, and further 2) that the developing brain can represent more information than the adult brain.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes are generated from a widely distributed population of progenitors that express neurotransmitter receptors, but the mechanisms that alter activity of these oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in vivo have not been determined. We generated a novel line of transgenic mice to express membrane-anchored GCaMP6s in OPCs and used longitudinal two-photon microscopy to monitor their Ca2+ changes in the cerebral cortex of awake mice. OPCs exhibited high rates of spontaneous activity, consisting of focal, transient Ca2+ increases within their highly ramified processes. Unexpectedly, these events occurred independent of excitatory neuron activity, but were inhibited by anesthesia, sedative agents, and antagonists of noradrenergic signaling. These norepinephrine enhanced Ca2+ dynamics rapidly declined as with differentiation. Selective knockout of 1A adrenergic receptors in OPCs suppressed both spontaneous and locomotion-induced Ca2+ increases, indicating that OPCs are directly modulated by norepinephrine in vivo, providing a means to alter their dynamics and lineage progression during distinct brain states.",
