    "abstract": "A complete understanding of the genetic determinants underlying mammalian physiology and disease is limited by the availability of tools for high-throughput genetic dissection in the living organism. Genome-wide screening using CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering the genetic regulation of cellular processes, but the need to stably deliver single guide RNAs to millions of cells has largely restricted its implementation to ex vivo systems. There thus remains a pressing need for accessible high-throughput functional genomics in a living organism. Here, we establish genome-wide enrichment and depletion screening in the liver of a single mouse and use this approach to uncover the complete regulation of cellular fitness in a living organism. We uncover regulation of cell fitness not previously identified in cell culture screens, underscoring the power of bringing high-throughput functional genomics into the organism. The approach we developed is accessible, robust, scalable, and adaptable to diverse phenotypes and CRISPR applications. We have hereby established a foundation for high-throughput functional genomics in a living mammal, enabling unprecedented insight into physiology and disease.",

    "abstract": "In natural contexts, sensory processing and motor output are closely coupled, which is reflected in the fact that many brain areas contain both sensory and movement signals. However, standard reductionist paradigms decouple sensory decisions from their natural motor consequences, and head-fixation prevents the natural sensory consequences of self-motion. In particular, movement through the environment provides a number of depth cues beyond stereo vision that are poorly understood. To study the integration of visual processing and motor output in a naturalistic task, we investigated distance estimation in freely moving mice. We found that mice use vision to accurately jump across a variable gap, thus directly coupling a visual computation to its corresponding ethological motor output. Monocular eyelid suture did not affect gap jumping success, thus mice can use cues that do not depend on binocular disparity and stereo vision. Under monocular conditions, mice altered their head positioning and performed more vertical head movements, consistent with a shift from using stereopsis to other monocular cues, such as motion or position parallax. Finally, optogenetic suppression of primary visual cortex impaired task performance under both binocular and monocular conditions when optical fiber placement was localized to binocular or monocular zone V1, respectively. Together, these results show that mice can use monocular cues, relying on visual cortex, to accurately judge distance. Furthermore, this behavioral paradigm provides a foundation for studying how neural circuits convert sensory information into ethological motor output.",

    "abstract": "The substantial cost of new drug research and development has consistently posed a huge burden for both pharmaceutical companies and patients. In order to lower the expenditure and development failure rate, repurposing existing and approved drugs by identifying interactions between drug molecules and target proteins based on computational methods have gained growing attention. Here, we propose the DeepLPI, a novel deep learning-based model that mainly consists of ResNet-based 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and bi-directional long short term memory network (biLSTM), to establish an end-to-end framework for protein-ligand interaction prediction. We first encode the raw drug molecular sequences and target protein sequences into dense vector representations, which go through two ResNet-based 1D CNN modules to derive features, respectively. The extracted feature vectors are concatenated and further fed into the biLSTM network, followed by the MLP module to finally predict protein-ligand interaction. We downloaded the well-known BindingDB and Davis dataset for training and testing our DeepLPI model. We also applied DeepLPI on a COVID-19 dataset for externally evaluating the prediction ability of DeepLPI. To benchmark our model, we compared our DeepLPI with the state-of-the-art methods of DeepCDA and DeepDTA, and observed that our DeepLPI outperformed these methods, suggesting the high accuracy of the DeepLPI towards protein-ligand interaction prediction. The high prediction performance of DeepLPI on the different datasets displayed its high capability of protein-ligand interaction in generalization, demonstrating that the DeepLPI has the potential to pinpoint new drug-target interactions and to find better destinations for proven drugs.",

Current approaches to delineate cancer-initiating heterogeneity require a well-understood lineage hierarchy and cell-specific genetic tools, which are lacking for many tissues. Here, we circumvented this hurdle and investigated the capacity of fallopian tube cells in initiating serous ovarian cancer, utilizing a mouse genetic system that generates scattered GFP-labeled mutant cells. Through quantitative tracing of clonal expansion of individual mutant cells, we revealed that only a rare primitive subset enriched in the distal fallopian tube is capable of clonal expansion whereas others stall immediately upon acquiring oncogenic mutations. Expanded clones from this subset then encountered further attrition: many stalled shortly after while others sustained small cluster of proliferative cells and biased differentiation toward primitive fate. Taken together, our study showcases quantitative clonal tracing as a powerful approach to investigate cancer-initiating heterogeneity and clonal trajectory in tissues with limited prior knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Single cell proteomics is a powerful tool with potential for markedly enhancing understanding of cellular processes. Previously reported single cell proteomics innovations employ Orbitrap mass spectrometers. In this study we describe the development, optimization, and application of multiplexed single cell proteomics to the analysis of human-derived cells using trapped ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This method, denoted as pasefRiQ is an advance as it allows accurate peptide quantification at picogram peptide concentrations. When employing a peptide carrier channel to boost protein sequence coverage, we obtain over 40,000 tandem mass spectra in 30 minutes, while achieving higher sequence coverage of each identified protein than described for SCOPE2. Using NCI-H-358 cells, which are a human bronchioalveolar carcinoma and KRASG12C model cell line, we demonstrate that the level of coverage achieved using this method enables the quantification of up to 1,255 proteins per cell and the detection of multiple classes of post-translational modifications in single cells. Further, when cells were treated with sotorasib, a KRASG12C covalent inhibitor, pasefRiQ revealed cell-to-cell variability in the impact of the drug on the NCI-H-358 cells, providing insight missed by traditional analyses. We provide multiple resources necessary for the application of single cell proteomics to drug treatment studies including tools to reduce cell cycle linked proteomic effects from masking pharmacological phenotypes.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work describes the establishment of a single cell proteomics method using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Through this approach, we demonstrate the confident identification of post- translational modifications in single human-derived cells. Additionally, using a KRASG12C covalent inhibitor as a model compound we show that this method can be used to understand pharmacological responses of single human-derived cultured cells.",

    "abstract": "O_LIMore diverse plant communities generally produce more biomass than monocultures. This benefit of plant diversity is supposed to stem from resource partitioning of species in mixtures. Different plant species might use the resources spatially, temporally, or chemically in different ways. Along the same lines, for agricultural production crop mixtures outperform monocultures. Differences in vertical root distributions of crop species in mixtures could explain such higher yield.\nC_LIO_LIHere we used the stable isotopes of water and a Bayesian model to investigate the spatial water uptake patterns of six different crops species and how these patterns differ depending on the crop diversity. In addition, we calculated niche overlaps of water uptake as an indicator for belowground spatial niche partitioning, compared them among the different diversity levels, and linked them to productivity.\nC_LIO_LIThe spatial water uptake pattern differed among crop species. The effect of crop diversity had a minor effect on water uptake but varied strongly depending on the crop species. Niche overlap in spatial water uptake was highest in monocultures and decreased strongly in mixtures. Furthermore, productivity in mixtures was higher compared to monoculture. Additionally, we showed that increased competition intensity leads to stronger changes in water uptake patterns.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. We found evidence for niche partitioning of spatial water uptake, and therefore complementary spatial root distribution, and higher productivity in crop mixtures compared to monocultures. Consequently, a more efficient use of soil resources in intercropping systems might explain their yield benefits.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The epitranscriptome embodies many new and largely unexplored functions of RNA. A major roadblock in the epitranscriptomics field is the lack of transcriptome-wide methods to detect more than a single RNA modification type at a time, identify RNA modifications in individual molecules, and estimate modification stoichiometry accurately. We address these issues with CHEUI (CH3 (methylation) Estimation Using Ionic current), a new method that concurrently detects N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytidine (m5C) in individual RNA molecules from the same sample, as well as differential methylation between any two conditions. CHEUI processes observed and expected nanopore direct RNA sequencing signals with convolutional neural networks to achieve high single-molecule accuracy and outperforms other methods in detecting m6A and m5C sites and quantifying their stoichiometry. CHEUIs unique capability to identify two modification types in the same sample reveals a non-random co-occurrence of m6A and m5C in mRNA transcripts in cell lines and tissues. CHEUI unlocks an unprecedented potential to study RNA modification configurations and discover new epitranscriptome functions.",

We examined body (RNA/DNA, length-weight residuals) and nutritional (fatty acid composition) condition of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in British Columbia, while migrating through varied oceanographically waters. Fish were sampled in the stratified northern Strait of Georgia (NSoG); the highly mixed Johnstone Strait (JS); and the transitional zone of Queen Charlotte Strait (QCS). In 2015, body and nutritional condition were high in the NSoG and responded rapidly to reach lowest levels in JS with its low prey availability, and showing signs of compensatory growth in QCS. In 2016, juvenile salmon had significantly lower condition in the NSoG than in 2015, although zooplankton biomass was similar, condition remained low in JS, and no compensatory growth was observed in QCS. We provide evidence that differences in juvenile salmon condition between the two years being due to changes in the food quality available to juvenile fish.

    "abstract": "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a key antimicrobial feature of cellular innate immunity mediated by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the primary human leukocyte population. NETs trap and kill microbes but have also been linked to inflammation, e.g. atherosclerosis, arthritis or psoriasis by unknown mechanisms. We here characterize naRNA (NET-associated RNA), as a new canonical, abundant, and unexplored inflammatory NET component. naRNA, upon release by NET formation, drove further NET formation in naive PMN, and induced macrophage and keratinocyte activation via TLR8 in humans and Tlr13 in mice, in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in vivo naRNA strongly drove skin inflammation, whereas genetic ablation of RNA sensing drastically ameliorated psoriatic skin inflammation. Rather than accidentally assembling with LL37 on the NET, naRNA was intracellularly pre-associated in resting neutrophils as a  composite DAMP, thus highlighting NET formation as a DAMP release process. This re-defines sterile NETs as an intentionally inflammatory agent, signaling and amplifying neutrophil activation. Moreover, in the many conditions previously linked to NETs and extracellular RNA, TLR-mediated naRNA sensing emerges as both potential cause and new intervention target.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499571v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (94K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b866org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16139ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a2905org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b0e7e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Created with biorender.com",

    "abstract": "2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a synthetic analogue of the plant hormone auxin that is commonly used in many in vitro plant regeneration systems, such as somatic embryogenesis (SE). Its effectiveness in inducing SE, compared to the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), has been attributed to the stress triggered by this compound rather than its auxin activity. However, this hypothesis has never been thoroughly tested. Here we used a library of 40 2,4-D analogues to test the structure-activity relationship with respect to the capacity to induce SE and auxin activity in Arabidopsis thaliana. Four analogues induced SE as effectively as 2,4-D and 13 analogues induced SE but were less effective. Based on root growth inhibition and auxin response reporter expression, the 2,4-D analogues were classified into different groups, ranging from very active auxins to not active. A halogen at the 4-position of the aromatic ring was important for auxin activity, whereas a halogen at the 3-position resulted in reduced activity. Moreover, a small substitution at the carboxylate chain was tolerated, as was extending the carboxylate chain with two but not with one carbon. In the process, we also identified two 2,4-D analogues as efficient inducers of adventitious root formation and several possible anti-auxins. The auxin activity of the 2,4-D analogues was consistent with their simulated TIR1-Aux/IAA coreceptor binding characteristics. A strong correlation was observed between SE induction efficiency and auxin activity, indicating that the stress-related effects triggered by 2,4-D that are considered important for SE induction are down-stream of auxin signaling.",

In understorey insectivores, the degree of dissimilarity between species-specific primary and logged forest niches was strongly and negatively correlated with survival and body mass trends in logged forest. Here, we show that temperature-humidity niche shifts in response to anthropogenic habitat modification can impact demographic vital rates and body condition crucial for population persistence. This work has the potential to inform prompt, targeted conservation efforts toward species that are the most threatened in a warmer and more degraded world.",

    "abstract": "Memories are thought to be stored in neural ensembles known as engrams that are specifically reactivated during memory recall. Recent studies have found that memory engrams of two events that happened close in time tend to overlap in the hippocampus and the amygdala, and these overlaps have been shown to support memory linking. It has been hypothesised that engram overlaps arise from the mechanisms that regulate memory allocation itself, involving neural excitability, but the exact process remains unclear. Indeed, most theoretical studies focus on synaptic plasticity and little is known about the role of intrinsic plasticity, which could be mediated by neural excitability and serve as a complementary mechanism for forming memory engrams. Here, we developed a rate-based recurrent neural network that includes both synaptic plasticity and neural excitability. We obtained structural and functional overlap of memory engrams for contexts that are presented close in time, consistent with experimental studies. Moreover, we showed that enhancing the initial excitability of a subset of neurons just before presenting a context biases the memory allocation to these neurons. We then explored the role of inhibition as a way of controlling competition among neurons from two ensembles. This work suggests mechanisms underlying the role of intrinsic excitability in memory allocation and linking, and yields predictions regarding the dynamics of memory engrams.",

In addition to its secretory role in ensuring functional maturation and survival of spermatozoa, the epididymis has a complex immune function. Indeed, it must manage both peripheral tolerance to sperm antigens foreign to the immune system and the protection of spermatozoa as well as the organ itself against pathogens ascending the epididymal tubule.

    "abstract": "The gustatory region of the insular cortex (GC) processes taste information in manners important for taste-guided behaviors, including food intake itself. In addition to oral gustatory stimuli, GC activity is also influenced by physiological states including hunger. The specific cell-types and molecular mechanisms that afford with GC with such influences on food intake are unclear. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is produced by neurons in the brain whereafter it can act upon GLP-1 receptor-expressing (GLP-1R+) neurons found in several brain regions. In these brain regions, GLP-1R agonism suppresses homeostatic food intake and dampens the hedonic value of food. Here, we report in mice of both sexes that cells within the GC express GLP-1R mRNA and further, by ex vivo brain slice recordings, that GC GLP-1R+ neurons are depolarized by the selective GLP-1R agonist, exendin-4 (Ex-4). Next we found that chemogenetic stimulation of GLP-1R+ neurons, and also pharmacological stimulation of GC-GLP-1Rs themselves, both reduced homeostatic food intake. When maintained on a high-fat diet, obese mice exhibited impaired food intake responses when Ex-4 was administered into the GC. Yet, when obese mice were switched to a low-fat diet, the effect of GC Ex-4 was restored - indicating that GC GLP-1R influences may depend upon palatability of the food. Together, these results provide evidence for a specific cell population in the GC which may hold roles in both homeostatic and hedonic food intake.",

    "abstract": "Misregulation of neuronal autophagy has been implicated in age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease. We compared autophagosome formation and maturation in primary murine neurons during development and through aging to elucidate how aging affects neuronal autophagy. We observed an age-related decrease in the rate of formation of LC3B-positive autophagosomes leading to a significant decrease in the density of autophagosomes along the axon. Next, we assessed the maturation of autophagic vesicles and identified a surprising increase in their maturation in neurons from aged mice. While we did not detect notable changes in endolysosomal content in the distal axon during aging, we found that autophagic vesicles were transported more efficiently in neurons from adult mice than in neurons from young mice. This efficient transport of autophagic vesicles in both the distal and proximal axon is maintained in neurons from aged mice and indicates that aging alone does not impair transport nor negatively impact the later stages of autophagy. However, the pronounced deficit in autophagosome biogenesis in aged neurons may contribute to a decreased capacity to clear aggregated proteins or dysfunctional organelles and thus contribute to age-related degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Actin is integral to eukaryotic physiology as a biomechanical polymer and as a structural barrier for cell-autonomous defense against infection. Some microbial pathogens exploit the actin cytoskeleton, however, to evade cell-autonomous immunity. Subversion of actin to enter host cells and for actin-based motility are often employed by intracellular pathogens to spread from cell-to-cell. Using RNA-sequencing and computational data mining, we identify the host actin-binding protein XIRP1 as commonly induced during infection. XIRP1 is expressed by fibroblasts and macrophages in response to immune cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) and infection with bacteria such as Listeria, Shigella, and Salmonella. Confocal and super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) found XIRP1 localizes to fibroblast focal adhesions and macrophages podosomes. Within human macrophages, XIRP1 is recruited to cytosolic Listeria monocytogenes in an ActA-dependent manner as it replicates and uses actin-based motility for host cell escape. Chromosomal removal of XIRP1 in mice impaired this dissemination and rendered them more resistant to Listeria infection than C57BL/6NJ wildtype controls in vivo. We propose that professional cytosolic pathogens like Listeria can co-opt XIRP1 to escape the hostile intracellular environment of IFN-{gamma}-activated macrophages as part of the host-pathogen arms race during cell-autonomous immunity.",

While the mechanism of defense for some of these systems is understood, a major unanswered question is how these systems sense phage infection. To systematically address this question, we isolated 192 phage mutants that escape 19 different defense systems. In many cases, these escaper phages were mutated in the gene sensed by the defense system, enabling us to map the phage determinants that confer sensitivity to bacterial immunity. Our data identify specificity determinants of diverse retron systems and reveal phage-encoded triggers for multiple abortive infection systems. We find general themes in phage sensing and demonstrate that mechanistically diverse systems have converged to sense either the core replication machinery of the phage, phage structural components, or host takeover mechanisms. Combining our data with previous findings, we formulate key principles on how bacterial immune systems sense phage invaders.",

    "abstract": "Microsporidia are a large phylum of intracellular parasites that can infect most types of animals. Species in the Nematocida genus can infect nematodes including Caenorhabditis elegans, which has become an important model to study mechanisms of microsporidia infection. To understand the genomic properties and evolution of nematode-infecting microsporidia, we sequenced the genomes of nine species of microsporidia, including two genera, Enteropsectra and Pancytospora, without any previously sequenced genomes. Core cellular processes, including metabolic pathways, are mostly conserved across genera of nematode-infecting microsporidia. Each species encodes unique proteins belonging to large gene families that are likely used to interact with host cells. Most strikingly, we observed one such family, NemLGF1, is present in both Nematocida and Pancytospora species, suggesting horizontal gene transfer between species from different genera. To understand how Nematocida phenotypic traits evolved, we measured the host range, tissue specificity, spore size, and polar tube length of several species in the genus. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that Nematocida is composed of two groups of species with distinct traits and that species with longer polar tubes infect multiple tissues. Together, our work details both genomic and trait evolution between related microsporidia species and provides a useful resource for further understanding microsporidia evolution and infection mechanisms.\n\nAuthor SummaryMicrosporidia are microbial parasites that can infect many animals. Nematodes have become a useful system to study microsporidia as these animals are commonly infected by microsporidia and these infections can be easily studied in a laboratory environment. To better understand how microsporidia evolve and change their properties as they infect different hosts, we sequenced the genomes of nine microsporidia species which infect nematodes. We found that metabolic pathways were mostly conserved between different clades of these species. Surprisingly, we found a family of proteins predicted to facilitate host interactions that is present in two distinct genera, suggesting that these genes were transferred between microsporidia species. We also determined the hosts and tissues that these microsporidia can infect as well as morphological properties of the microsporidia. We show that these properties are quite variable in related microsporidia species. Our results provide insight into the evolution of microsporidia and also provide a resource for studying microsporidia infections in nematodes.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the early wounding responses to promote plant regeneration remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) interacts with Topless/Topless-related proteins (TPL/TPRs) to regulate the expression of regeneration-related genes to modulate root tip regeneration. One ligand of FER, rapid alkalinization factor 33 (RALF33), is stimulated by wounding and functions together with FER to promote regeneration. Single-cell sequencing data showed that the low-differentiation cell types in the stele may account for the enhanced regeneration ability in the fer mutant, especially in the columella and quiescent center (QC). Further interaction assays and analysis of the gene expression patterns in low-differentiation cell types confirmed that FER interacts with TPL/TPRs to regulate the expression of downstream regeneration-related genes. One of their downstream targets, an essential transcription factor (TF) in root regeneration, ERF115, acts downstream of FER-TPL/TPRs to control regeneration. Our results suggested a signaling pathway between the early wounding response and regeneration processes in roots.\n\nOne-sentence summaryRALF33-FER serves as an early signaling module between wounding and regeneration by functioning with TPL/TPRs in roots.",

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are lipid storage organelles that consist of a central core of neutral lipids surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer decorated with a unique set of integral and peripheral proteins. Invariably, at least one member of the perilipin family of proteins (PLIN1-5) associates with LDs in all cell types. Despite key roles of PLIN2 in governing hepatic lipid metabolism, the mechanisms that regulate PLIN2 levels remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a set of genome-edited PLIN2 reporter cell lines that facilitate the analysis of genes that regulate PLIN2 and LD abundance. Leveraging these reporter cells in a series of CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens, we generate a comprehensive inventory of genes that influence PLIN2 levels under different metabolic conditions. Moreover, we uncouple their effects on PLIN2 expression and post-translational stability. Identified genetic modifiers include canonical genes that control LD metabolism (e.g., ACSL3, DGAT2, PNPLA2, ABHD5) as well as genes with less characterized roles in PLIN2 and LD regulation such as ubiquitination machinery (e.g., MARCH6, UBE2J2), transcription regulators (e.g., HNF4A, HDAC3), mitochondrial pathways (e.g., electron transport chain and mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis), and others. These CRISPR screens, and several published screens that focus on different aspects of lipid metabolism, provide the foundation for CRISPRlipid (http://crisprlipid.org), a versatile, online data commons for lipid-related functional genomics data. Together, our study uncovers new mechanisms of PLIN2 regulation and provides an extensive, phenotype-rich resource for the exploration of LD biology and lipid metabolism.",

Using multi-omic profiling upon acute depletion of eIF3 subunits, we observed that while eIF3a, b, e, and f markedly differed in their impact on eIF3 holo-complex formation and translation, they were each required for cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. Remarkably, eIF3k showed the opposite pattern with depletion promoting global translation, cell proliferation, tumor growth, and stress resistance through repressing the synthesis of ribosomal proteins, especially RPS15A. Whereas ectopic expression of RPS15A mimicked the anabolic effects of eIF3k depletion, disruption of eIF3 binding to the 5-UTR of RSP15A mRNA negated them. Supported by mathematical modeling, our data uncovers eIF3k-l as a mRNA-specific module which, through controlling RPS15A translation, serves as a rheostat of ribosome content to secure spare translational capacity that can be mobilized during stress.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMany insects harbor heritable beneficial microbes that influence host phenotypes. Across systems, divergent symbiont strains have been shown to establish at different densities within hosts. This genetic variation is important evolutionarily because within-host density has been linked to the costs and benefits of the symbiosis for both partners. Studying the factors shaping within-host density is therefore important to our broader understanding of host-microbe coevolution. Here we focused on different strains of Regiella insecticola, a facultative symbiont of aphids. We first demonstrated that different strains of Regiella consistently establish in pea aphids at drastically different densities. We then found that variation in density is correlated with the expression levels of two key insect immune system genes (phenoloxidase and hemocytin), with immune gene suppression correlating with higher Regiella density. We then performed an experiment where we established co-infections of a higher- and lower-density Regiella strain, and we showed that the higher-density strain is better able to persist in co-infections than the lower-density strain. Together, our results point to a potential mechanism for strain-level variation in symbiont density in this system, and further suggest that symbiont fitness may be increased by establishing at higher density within hosts. Our work highlights the importance of within-host dynamics shaping symbiont evolution.",

    "abstract": "Detection of the genomic basis of local adaptation to environmental conditions is challenging in forest trees. Phytochromes (PHY) and cryptochromes (CRY) perceive the red (R)/far-red (FR) and blue light respectively and, play a fundamental role in regulating the light pathway in plants contributing to plant growth and development. Norway spruce shows an adaptive latitudinal cline for shade (low R:FR or FR-enriched light) tolerance and requirement of FR light for its growth, thus showing differential response to light quality. We analyzed the exome capture data that included a uniquely large data set of 1654 Norway spruce trees sampled from different latitudes across Sweden that differ in exposure to photoperiod and FR light received during the growing season. Statistically significant clinal variation was detected in allele and genotype frequencies of missense mutations in coding regions belonging to well-defined functional domains of PHYO (PAS-B), PHYP2 (PAS fold-2), CRY1 (CCT1) and CRY2 (CCT2) that strongly correlates with the latitudinal gradient in response to variable light quality in Norway spruce. Asn835Ser in PHYO displayed the steepest cline among all other polymorphisms. We propose that these variations represent signs of local adaptation to light quality in Norway spruce.",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction via coarse grain modeling has positioned itself as an indispensable tool for decades, particularly for biomolecular simulations where atomic systems encompass hundreds of millions of atoms. While distinct flavors of coarse grain modeling exist, those occupying the coarse end of the spectrum are typically knowledge based, relying on a priori information to parameterize models, thus hindering general predictive capability. Here, we present an algorithmic and transferable approach known as shape based coarse graining (SBCG) which employs unsupervised machine learning via competitive Hebbian adaptation to construct coarse molecules that perfectly represent atomistic topologies. We show how SBCG provides ample control over model granularity, and we provide a quantitative metric for selection thereof. Parameter optimization, inclusion of small molecule species, as well as simulation configuration are discussed in detail. Our method and its implementation is made available as part of the CGBuilder plugin, present in the widely-used visual molecular dynamics (VMD) and nanoscale molecular dynamics (NAMD) software suites. We demonstrate applications of our method with a variety of systems from the inositol hexaphosphate-bound, full-scale HIV-1 capsid to heteromultimeric cofilin-2-bound actin filaments. Overall, we show that SBCG provides a simple yet robust approach to coarse graining that requires minimal user input and lacks any ad hoc interactions between protein domains. Furthermore, because the Hamiltonian employed in SBCG is CHARMM compatible, SBCG takes full advantage of the latest GPU-accelerated NAMD3 yielding molecular sampling of over a microsecond per day for systems that span micrometers.",

The mechanistic roles of this protein in malignancy, however, are largely unexplored. Here we show that K17 expression and disassembly enhances tumor growth and metastatic potential and shortens survival. Using mass spectrometry in K17 isolated from patients tumors, we identified a hotspot phosphorylation site in serines 10-13. Site-mutagenesis revealed that phosphorylation of this hotspot is sufficient to disassemble K17 and promote its nuclear translocation. In silico and pharmacologic inhibition studies uncovered the role of the PKC/MEK/RSK pathway in the phosphorylation and disassembly of K17. Murine models bearing tumors expressing phosphomimetic mutations at the serine hotspot displayed enhanced metastases, compared to mice bearing tumors expressing wild-type K17 or phosphorylation-resistant K17. Lastly, we found that detergent-soluble nuclear K17 promotes the expression of metastasis promoting genes in both patient and murine tumors. These results suggest that phosphorylation at specific serines is sufficient to promote pancreatic cancer metastasis and shorter survival, and that these sites could provide novel, druggable therapeutic domains to enhance PDAC patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) evaluates the pharmacology of drug and investigational agent libraries for potential therapeutic uses, toxicological risk assessment, and increasingly for academic chemical tool discovery. Phenotypic HTS assays aim to interrogate molecular pathways and networks, often relying on cell culture systems, historically with less emphasis on multicellular organisms. C. elegans has served as a powerful eukaryotic model organism for human biology and disease by virtue of genetic conservation and experimental tractability. Here we describe a paradigm to enable C. elegans in qHTS using 384-well microtiter plate laser scanning cytometry. GFP-expressing organisms are used to reveal phenotype-modifying structure-activity relationships to guide subsequent life stages and proteomic analysis. E. coli bacterial ghosts, a non-replicating nutrient source, allow compound exposures over 7-days spanning two life cycles to mitigate complications from bacterial overgrowth. We demonstrate the method with a library composed of anti-infective agents, or molecules of general toxicological concern. Each was tested in 7-point titration to assess the feasibility of nematode-based in vivo qHTS, and examples of follow-up strategies were provided to study organism-based chemotype selectivity and subsequent network perturbations having a physiological impact. We anticipate a broader application of this qHTS-coupled proteomics approach will enable the analysis of C. elegans orthologous transgenic phenotypes of human pathologies to facilitate drug and probe profiling from high-impact chemical libraries for a range of therapeutic indications and study of potential toxicological signatures.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505462v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7ef320org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8bc35corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c6f446org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf56f1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We identified two populations of potential progenitor cells resident within the adrenal cortex: adrenocortical progenitors NR2F2+-ID1+ cells, located within and underneath the capsule, and medullary progenitors SYT1+-CHGA- cells, located in islets in the subcapsular region. Using pseudotime analyses, we provided evidence of the centripetal nature of adrenocortical cell development and of the essential role played by the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway in the adrenocortical self-renewal. By comparing transcriptional profiles of cells of normal adrenal glands and adrenocortical adenomas we revealed a high heterogeneity with six adenoma-specific clusters.

    "abstract": "Excess consumption of carbohydrates, fat, and calories leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatic insulin resistance; major factors in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. Hormones and catecholamines acting through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) linked to phospholipase C (PLC) and increases in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) regulate many metabolic functions of the liver. In the intact liver, catabolic hormones such as glucagon, catecholamines and vasopressin integrate and synergize to regulate the frequency and extent to which [Ca2+]c waves propagate across hepatic lobules to control metabolism. Dysregulation of hepatic Ca2+ homeostasis has been implicated in the development of metabolic disease, but changes in hepatic GPCR-dependent Ca2+ signalling have been largely unexplored in this context. We show that short-term, 1-week, high fat diet (HFD) feeding of mice attenuates norepinephrine-stimulated Ca2+ signalling, reducing the number of cells responding and suppressing the frequency of [Ca2+]c oscillations in both isolated hepatocytes and intact liver. The 1-week HFD feeding paradigm did not change basal Ca2+ homeostasis; endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load, store-operated Ca2+ entry and plasma membrane Ca2+ pump activity were unchanged compared to low fat diet (LFD) fed controls. However, norepinephrine-induced IP3 production was significantly reduced after HFD feeding, demonstrating an effect of HFD on receptor-stimulated PLC activity. Thus, we have identified a lesion in the PLC signalling pathway induced by short-term HFD feeding, which interferes with hormonal Ca2+ signalling in isolated hepatocytes and the intact liver. These early events may drive adaptive changes in signalling, which lead to pathological consequences in fatty liver disease.\n\nKey points summaryO_LINon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing epidemic.\nC_LIO_LIIn healthy liver, the counteracting effects of catabolic and anabolic hormones regulate metabolism and energy storage as fat. Hormones and catecholamines promote catabolic metabolism via increases in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c).\nC_LIO_LIWe show that 1 week high fat diet (HFD) feeding of mice attenuated the Ca2+ signals induced by physiological concentrations of norepinephrine. Specifically, HFD suppressed the normal pattern of periodic [Ca2+]c oscillations in isolated hepatocytes and disrupted the propagation of intralobular [Ca2+]c waves in the intact perfused liver.\nC_LIO_LIShort-term HFD inhibited norepinephrine-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation, but did not change basal endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load or plasma membrane Ca2+ fluxes.\nC_LIO_LIWe propose that impaired Ca2+ signalling plays a key role in the earliest phases of the etiology of NAFLD, and is responsible for many of the ensuing metabolic and related dysfunctional outcomes at the cellular and whole tissue level.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsGlissons capsule is the interstitial connective tissue that surrounds the liver. As part of its normal physiology, it withstands significant daily changes in liver size. The pathophysiology of the capsule in disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the changes in capsule matrix, cellular composition, and mechanical properties that occur in liver disease and to determine whether these correlate with disease severity or etiology.\n\nMethods10 control, 6 steatotic, 7 moderately fibrotic and 37 cirrhotic patient samples were collected from autopsies, intraoperative biopsies and liver explants. Matrix proteins and cell markers were assessed by staining and second harmonic generation imaging. Mechanical tensile testing was performed on a test frame.\n\nResultsCapsule thickness was significantly increased in cirrhotic samples compared to normal controls irrespective of disease etiology (69.62 {+/-} 9.99 and 171.269 {+/-} 16.65 {micro}m respectively), whereas steatosis and moderate fibrosis had no effect on thickness (62.15 {+/-} 4.97 {micro}m). Changes in cirrhosis included an increase in cell number (fibroblasts, vascular cells, infiltrating immune cells and biliary epithelial cells). Key matrix components (collagens 1 and 3, hyaluronan, versican and elastin) were all deposited in the lower capsule although only the relative amounts per area of hyaluronan and versican were increased. Organizational features including crimping and alignment of collagen fibers were also altered in cirrhosis. Unexpectedly, capsules from cirrhotic livers had decreased resistance to loading in comparison to controls.\n\nConclusionsThe liver capsule, like the parenchyma, is an active site of disease, demonstrating changes in matrix and cell composition as well as mechanical properties.\n\nLay summaryWe assessed the changes in composition and response to stretching of the liver outer sheath, the capsule, in human liver disease. We find an increase in key structural components and numbers of cells as well as a change in matrix organization of the capsule in the later stages of disease. This allows the diseased capsule to stretch more under any given force, suggesting it is less stiff than healthy tissue.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505570v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10a9b60org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15eea52org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@69b874org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cccd03_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe capsule is an active site of disease: thickness and cellularity increase markedly in cirrhosis\nC_LIO_LIExtracellular matrix composition and organization change in cirrhosis\nC_LIO_LIThe cirrhotic capsule stretches more and is less stiff\nC_LI",

To gain further support for its placement its chemistry was investigated. The compounds isolated from Hemp 7152 were four quinoline alkaloids, kokusaginine (1), N-methylplaty-desminium ion (9), ribalinium ion (10), and isoplatydesmine (11), and seven acridone alkaloids, arborinine (2) 1,2,3-trimethoxy-N-methylacridone (3), 1,2,3,5-tetramethoxy-N-methylacridone (4), 1,3-dimethoxy-N-methylacridone (5) and toddaliopsis A (6), evoxanthine (7) and tecleanthine (8). In addition, lupeol and ferulic acid were isolated from this plant. The combination of quinoline and acridone alkaloids is restricted to the Rutaceae family, confirming beyond reasonable doubt the placement of this material in the Rutaceae. Within Rutaceae in tropical Africa, only the genus Vepris is unarmed, with trifoliolate leaves. Using an identification key, and herbarium specimen matching, Hemp 7152 was morphologically placed as close to Vepris uguenensis, sharing xerophytic characters unusual in the genus. The species are geographically close, occurring in adjoining mountains in northern Tanzania. However, Vepris uguenensis contains 13 alkaloids which are not present in Hemp 7152, nor in any other species of Vepris that has been studied, supporting species recognition for Hemp 7152 which is formally named as Vepris hemp, morphologically characterised, illustrated and assessed as Critically Endangered using the IUCN 2012 standard.

    "abstract": "The world requires a rise in crop production which needs to be increased significantly in order to satisfy demand by 20501. However traditional plant breeding approaches are anticipated to fall short in delivering the increases in yield required and therefore targeted manipulation of plant metabolism is increasingly being pursued with the aim to achieve this goal2. Improving photosynthetic efficiency is predicted to have a significant influence on enhancing crop productivity and several ambitious genetic engineering projects are currently under way to achieve higher photosynthetic rates in crops3,4. A naturally evolved adaptive trait which allows plants to increase photosynthetic efficiency specifically under high light is the differentiation of  sun leaves which are characterised by an increase in palisade cell layers and more elongated cells within this layer5. These morphological changes allow a more efficient distribution of light within the leaf and provide an increased cell surface to which chloroplasts can relocate thereby increasing the capacity for CO up-take6. Here we show that, surprisingly, this complex morphological trait can be phenocopied by the modulation of the expression of a single palisade specific gene, IQD22, in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we could show that the architectural changes were reflected in an increase of photosynthetic rate of 30%. The simplicity with which we could enhance photosynthesis by phenocopying sun leave traits is in stark contrast to the complex and challenging metabolic engineering approaches currently being pursued.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal spiking activity in cortical circuits is often temporally structured by collective rhythms. Rhythmic activity has been hypothesized to regulate temporal coding and to mediate the flexible routing of information flow across the cortex. Spiking neuronal circuits, however, are non-linear systems that, through chaotic dynamics, can amplify insignificant microscopic fluctuations into network-scale response variability. In nonlinear systems in general, rhythmic oscillatory drive can induce chaotic behavior or boost the intensity of chaos. Thus, neuronal oscillations could rather disrupt than facilitate cortical coding functions by flooding the finite population bandwidth with chaotically-boosted noise. Here we tackle a fundamental mathematical challenge to characterize the dynamics on the attractor of effectively delayed network models. We find that delays introduce a transition to collective oscillations, below which ergodic theory measures have a stereotypical dependence on the delay so far only described in scalar systems and low-dimensional maps. We demonstrate that the emergence of internally generated oscillations induces a complete dynamical reconfiguration, by increasing the dimensionality of the chaotic attractor, the speed at which nearby trajectories separate from one another, and the rate at which the network produces entropy. We find that periodic input drive leads to a dramatic increase of chaotic measures at a the resonance frequency of the recurrent network. However, transient oscillatory input only has a moderate role on the collective dynamics. Our results suggest that simple temporal dynamics of the mean activity can have a profound effect on the structure of the spiking patterns and therefore on the information processing capability of neuronal networks.",

Antibiotic sensitivity was done and ESBL, AmpC {beta}-lactamase, and MBL positive strains were identified by standard methods followed by PCR to detect ESBL, AmpC {beta}-lactamase, and MBL genes.\n\nFindingsTwenty seven different organisms were isolated and identified which were-Klebsiella spp (33{middle dot}33%), Citrobacter spp (29{middle dot}64%), Enterobacter spp (22{middle dot}22%), Escherichia coli (11{middle dot}11%), and Staphylococcus aureus (3{middle dot}70%). Among them 48{middle dot}15% organisms were resistant to different antibiotics. Only one organism (Citrobacter spp) produced ESBL phenotypically (7{middle dot}69%). Two (15{middle dot}38%) were positive for AmpC {beta}-lactamase and one of these (Enterobacter spp) possessed both SHV and CTX-M15A genes by PCR. Imipenem resistance was 84{middle dot}62% of the antibiotic resistant organisms, and 10 (90{middle dot}91%) were phenotypically MBL positive by CD test, DDS test, and MHT. By PCR, one Enterobacter spp had MBL encoding gene OXA-48.\n\nInterpretationFresh fruits, contaminated with pathogens, might be a source of transmission of resistant organisms and attribute to public health issues.\n\nFundingThe office of Directorate General of Health Service, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh.\n\nImportanceFruits sold around Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) are usually consumed by patients, patients attendant and Health care worker. This investigation emphasized not only on the extent of bacterial contamination but also attempted to measure the anti-microbial profile of these organisms isolated from the fruits commonly available and readily consumed in and around DMCH.",

    "abstract": "Dying cells in the epithelia communicate with neighboring cells to initiate coordinated cell removal to maintain epithelial integrity. Naturally occurring apoptotic cells are mostly extruded basally and engulfed by macrophages. Here, we investigated the role of Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) signaling in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis. In Drosophila embryos, epithelial tissues undergoing groove formation preferentially enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling. In EGFR mutant embryos at stage 11, sporadic apical cell extrusion in the head initiates a cascade of apical extrusions of apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells that sweeps the entire ventral body wall. Here, we showed that clustered apoptosis, groove formation, and wounding sensitized EGFR mutant epithelia to initiate massive tissue disintegration. We further showed that tissue detachment from the vitelline membrane, which frequently occurs during morphogenetic processes, is a key trigger for the EGFR mutant phenotype. These findings indicate that, in addition to cell survival, EGFR plays a role in maintaining epithelial integrity, which is essential for protecting tissues from transient instability caused by morphogenetic movement and damage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryWhile it has been appreciated for decades that prophase-arrested oocytes are transcriptionally silenced on a global level, the molecular pathways that promote silencing have remained elusive. Previous work in C. elegans has shown that both topoisomerase II (TOP-2) and condensin II collaborate with the H3K9me heterochromatin pathway to silence gene expression in the germline during L1 starvation, and that the PIE-1 protein silences the genome in the P-lineage of early embryos. Here, we show that all three of these silencing systems, TOP-2/condensin II, H3K9me, and PIE-1, are required for transcriptional repression in oocytes. We find that H3K9me3 marks increase dramatically on chromatin during silencing, and that silencing is under cell cycle control. We also find that PIE-1 localizes to the nucleolus just prior to silencing, and that nucleolar dissolution during silencing is dependent on TOP-2/condensin II. Our data identify both the molecular components and the trigger for genome silencing in oocytes and establish a link between PIE-1 nucleolar residency and its ability to repress transcription.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 50 years, a wealth of testable, often conflicting, hypotheses have been generated about the evolution of offspring sex ratio manipulation by mothers. Several of these hypotheses have received support in studies of invertebrates and some vertebrate taxa. However, their success in explaining sex ratios in mammalian taxa, and especially in primates, has been mixed. Here, we assess the predictions of four different hypotheses about the evolution of biased offspring sex ratios in the well-studied baboons of the Amboseli basin in Kenya: the Trivers-Willard, female rank enhancement, local resource competition, and local resource enhancement hypotheses. Using the largest sample size ever analyzed in a primate population (n = 1372 offspring), we test the predictions of each hypothesis. Overall, we find no support for adaptive biasing of sex ratios. Offspring sex is not consistently related to maternal dominance rank or biased towards the dispersing sex, nor it is predicted by group size, population growth rates, or their interaction with maternal rank. Because our sample size confers power to detect even subtle biases in sex ratio, including modulation by environmental heterogeneity, these results suggest that adaptive biasing of offspring sex does not occur in this population.",

Aberrant MITF activity can lead to multiple malignancies including skin cancer, where it modulates the proliferation and invasiveness of melanoma. MITF-dependent gene expression requires recruitment of transcriptional co-activators such as CBP/p300, but details of this process are not fully defined. Here, we investigate the structural and functional interaction between the MITF N-terminal transactivation domain (MITFTAD) and CBP/p300. A combination of pulldown assays and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy determined that MITF binds both TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains of CBP/p300 with high affinity. The solution-state structure of the MITFTAD:TAZ2 complex reveals that MITF interacts with a hydrophobic surface of TAZ2, while remaining relatively dynamic. Peptide array and mutagenesis experiments determined that an acidic motif is integral to the MITFTAD:TAZ2 interaction and is necessary for transcriptional activity of MITF. Peptides that bind to the same surface of TAZ2 as MITFTAD, such as the adenoviral protein E1A, are capable of displacing MITF from TAZ2 and inhibiting transactivation. These results provide mechanistic insight into co-activator recruitment by MITF that are fundamental to our understanding of MITF targeted gene regulation and melanoma biology.",

Nevertheless, how membrane lipid composition is altered in HCC cells with abnormal Wnt signaling remains elusive. Here, by exploiting comprehensive lipidome profiling, we unravel membrane lipid composition of six different HCC cell lines with mutations in components of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, leading to differences in their endogenous signaling activity. Among the differentially regulated lipids are diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide, which were downregulated at the membrane of HCC cells after Wnt3a stimulation. DAG and ceramide enhanced Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in SNU475 and HepG2 cells. In contrast, depletion of DAG and ceramide suppressed Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling and significantly impeded the proliferation, tumor growth and in vivo migration capacity of SNU475 and HepG2 cells. This study, by pioneering plasma membrane lipidome profiling in HCC cells, exhibits the remarkable potential of lipids to correct dysregulated signaling pathways in cancer and stop abnormal tumor growth.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are essential in cancer prognostication and treatment through the ability to indicate the tumors capacity to evade the immune system (e.g., as evidenced by nodal involvement). Machine learning technologies have demonstrated remarkable success for localizing TILs, though these methods require extensive curation of manual annotations or restaining procedures that can degrade tissue quality, resulting in imprecise annotation. In this study, we co-registered tissue slides stained for both hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence (IF) as means to rapidly perform large-scale annotation of nuclei. We integrated the following approaches to improve the prediction of TILs: 1) minimized tissue degradation on same-section tissue restaining, 2) developed a scoring algorithm to improve the selection of patches for machine learning modeling and 3) utilized a graph neural network deep learning approach to identify relevant contextual features for lymphocyte prediction. Our graph neural network approach accounts for surrounding contextual micro/macro-architecture tissue features to facilitate interpretation of registered IF. The graph neural network compares favorably (F1-score=0.9235, AUROC=0.9462) to two alternative modeling approaches. This study brings insight to the importance of contextual information leveraged from within and around neighboring cells in a nuclei classification workflow, as well as elucidate approaches which enable the rapid generation of large-scale annotations of lymphocytes for machine learning approaches for immune phenotyping. Such approaches can help further interrogate the spatial biology of colorectal cancer tumors and tumor metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Because aphids are global agricultural pests and models for bacterial endosymbiosis, there is a need for reliable methods to study and control their gene function. However, current methods available for aphid gene knockout and knockdown of gene expression are often unreliable and time consuming. Techniques like CRISPR-Cas genome editing can take several months to achieve a single gene knockout because they rely on aphids going through a cycle of sexual reproduction, and aphids often lack strong, consistent levels of knockdown when fed or injected with molecules that induce an RNA interference (RNAi) response. In the hopes of addressing these challenges, we attempted to adapt a new method called symbiont-mediated RNAi (smRNAi) for use in aphids. smRNAi involves engineering a bacterial symbiont of the insect to continuously supply dsRNA inside the insect body. This approach has been successful in thrips, kissing bugs, and honeybees. We engineered the laboratory E. coli strain HT115 and the native aphid symbiont S. symbiotica CWBI-2.3T to produce dsRNA inside the gut of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) targeting salivary effector protein (C002) or ecdysone receptor genes. For C002 assays, we also tested co-knockdown with an aphid nuclease (Nuc1) to reduce RNA degradation. However, we found that smRNAi was not a reliable method for aphid gene knockdown under our conditions. We were unable to consistently achieve the expected phenotypic changes with either target. However, we did see indications that elements of the RNAi pathway were modestly upregulated, and expression of some targeted genes appeared to be somewhat reduced in some trials. We conclude with a discussion of the possible avenues through which smRNAi, and aphid RNAi in general, could be improved in the future.",

    "abstract": "1Despite the increasing burden of antibiotic resistance, current approaches to eradicate pathobionts such as Staphylococcus aureus from the nasal cavity are based on the use of antibacterial agents. An alternative approach is the artificial inoculation of commensal bacteria, i.e., probiotic treatment, which is supported by the increasing evidence for commensal-mediated inhibition of pathogens. To system-atically investigate the potential and the limitations of this approach, we developed a quantitative framework simulating the dynamics of the nasal bacterial microbiome by combining mathematical microbiome modeling with longitudinal metagenomic data. By inferring the structure and the magnitude of microbial interaction parameters using metagenomic data, and then simulating the nasal microbial dynamics of patients colonized with S. aureus, we could compare the decolonization performance of probiotic and antibiotic treatments under different assumptions on patients bacterial community composition and susceptibility profile. To further compare the robustness of these treatments, we simulated a S. aureus challenge following each treatment and quantified the recolonization probability. Our results suggest that probiotic treatment clearly outperforms antibiotics in terms of decolonization performance, recolonization robustness, and leads to less collateral reduction of the microbiome diversity. Moreover, we find that recolonization robustness is highest in those patients that were not initially colonized by Dolosigranulum pigrum. Thus, probiotic treatment may provide a promising alternative to combat antibiotic resistance, with the additional advantage of personalized treatment options via using the patients own metagenomic data to tailor the intervention. The in silico frame-work developed in this work is an important step forward to further investigate this alternative in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Despite several studies investigating the relationship between blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) and neuroelectric activity, our understanding is rather incomplete. For instance, the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) is commonly used, regardless of brain region, frequency of electric activity and functional networks. We studied this relationship between BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) signal of the human brain in detail using simultaneous fMRI and EEG in healthy awake human subjects at rest. Signals from EEG sensors were filtered into different frequency bands and reconstructed it in the three-dimensional source space. The correlation of the time courses of the two modalities were quantified on a voxel-by-voxel basis on full-brain level as well as separately for each resting state network, with different temporal shifts and EEG frequency bands. We found highly significant correlations between the BOLD-fMRI signal and simultaneously measured EEG, yet with varying time-lags for different frequency bands and different resting state networks. Additionally, we found significant negative correlations with a much longer delay in the fMRI BOLD signal. The positive correlations were mostly around 6-8 seconds delayed in the BOLD time course while the negative correlations were noticed with a BOLD delay of around 20 to 26 seconds. These positive and negative correlation patterns included the commonly reported alpha and gamma bands but also extend in other frequency bands giving characteristic profiles for different resting state networks. Our results confirm recent works that suggest that the relationship between the two modalities is rather brain region / network-specific than a global function and suggest that applying a global canonical HRF for electrophysiological data is probably insufficient to account for the different spatial and temporal dynamics of different brain networks. Moreover, our results suggest that the HRF also varies in different frequency bands giving way to further studies investigating cross-frequency coupling and its interplay with resting state networks.",

The kidney proximal tubule (PT) cells reabsorb disulphide-rich proteins through endocytosis, generating cystine via lysosomal proteolysis. Here we report that defective cystine mobilization from lysosomes through cystinosin (CTNS), which is mutated in cystinosis, diverts PT cells towards growth and proliferation, disrupting their functions. Mechanistically, cystine storage stimulates Ragulator-Rag GTPase-dependent recruitment of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its constitutive activation. Re-introduction of CTNS restores nutrient-dependent regulation of mTORC1 in knockout cells, whereas cell-permeant analogues of L-cystine, accumulating within lysosomes, render wild-type cells resistant to nutrient withdrawal. Therapeutic mTORC1 inhibition corrects lysosome and differentiation downstream of cystine storage, and phenotypes in a zebrafish model of cystinosis. Thus, cystine serves as a lysosomal signal that tailors mTORC1 and metabolism to direct epithelial cell fate decisions. These results identify mechanisms and therapeutic targets for dysregulated homeostasis in cystinosis.",
