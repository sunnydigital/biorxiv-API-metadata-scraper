    "abstract": "Facing a warming climate, many tropical species-including the arthropod vectors of several infectious diseases-will be displaced to higher latitudes and elevations. These shifts are frequently forecasted for the future, but rarely documented in the present day. Here, we use one of the most comprehensive datasets ever compiled by medical entomologists to track the observed range limits of African malaria mosquito vectors (Anopheles spp.) from 1898 to 2016. Using a simple regression approach, we estimate that these species ranges gained an average of 6.5 meters of elevation per year, and the southern limits of their ranges moved polewards 4.7 kilometers per year. These shifts are consistent with the local velocity of climate change, and might help explain the incursion of malaria transmission into new areas over the past few decades. Confirming that climate change underlies these shifts, and applying similar methods to other disease vectors, are important directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila ovary is regenerated from germline and somatic stem cell populations that have provided fundamental conceptual understanding on how adult stem cells are regulated within their niches. Recent ovarian transcriptomic studies have failed to identify mRNAs that are specific to follicle stem cells (FSCs), suggesting that their fate may be regulated post-transcriptionally. We have identified that the RNA-binding protein, Musashi (Msi) is required for maintaining the stem cell state of FSCs. Loss of msi function results in stem cell loss, not due to cell death, but mutant FSCs upregulate Lamin C, indicating a change in differentiation state. In msi mutant ovaries, Lamin C upregulation was also observed in posterior escort cells and mutant somatic cells within regions 2/3 were dysfunctional, as evidenced by the presence of germline cyst collisions and fused egg chambers. The msi locus produces two classes of mRNAs (long and short). We show that FSC maintenance and escort cell function specifically requires the long transcripts, thus providing the first evidence of isoform-specific regulation in a population of Drosophila epithelial cells. We further demonstrate that although male germline stem cells have previously been shown to require Msi function to prevent differentiation this is not the case for female germline stem cells, indicating that these similar stem cell types have different requirements for Msi, in addition to the differential use of Msi isoforms between soma and germline.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic sexual dimorphism can be mediated by sex differences in gene expression. We examine two forms of sexual dimorphism in gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster: (i) sex-biased gene expression (SBGE) in which the sexes differ in the amount a gene is expressed and (ii) sexual dimorphism in isoform usage, i.e., sex-specific splicing (SSS). In whole body (but not head) expression, we find a negative association between SBGE and SSS, possibly suggesting these are alternate routes to resolving sexual antagonistic selection. Next, we evaluate whether expression dimorphism contributes to the heterogeneity among genes in rmf, the intersexual genetic correlation in body expression that constrains the extent to which a genes expression can evolve independently between the sexes. We find lower rmf values for genes with than without SSS. We find higher rmf values for male- than female-biased genes (except genes with extreme male-bias), even though male-biased genes are known to have greater evolutionary divergence in expression. Finally, we examine population genetic patterns in relation to SBGE and SSS because genes with expression dimorphism have likely experienced a history of sex differences in selection. SSS is associated with reduced values of Tajimas D and elevated Direction of Selection (DoS) values, suggestive of higher rates of adaptive evolution. Though DoS is highly elevated for genes with extreme male bias, DoS otherwise tends to decline from female-biased to unbiased to male-biased genes. Collectively, the results indicate that SBGE and SSS are differentially distributed across the genome and are associated with different forms of selection.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWhen modeling task-related human brain activity it is often necessary to simulate brain signals with specific mutual correlations between them. The signals should resemble those observed in practice, and consist of an \"evoked\" (\"phase-locked\") component and a random oscillatory part. To be neurophysiologically plausible their waveforms must be shaped in a certain way or exhibit specific global features; in technical terms - they should be modulated by a certain envelope function. The goal of this technical note is to describe a simple way of how such signal sets can be obtained.\n\nMethodsWe derive a procedure which allows generating multi-epoch signals with the above properties. This is done by mixing a \"seed\" set of waveforms typically reflecting particular qualities of the target brain activity. As an example, the seed set can consist of realizations of colored noise with desired power spectrum, or can be obtained from real brain measurements.\n\nResultsThe algorithm yields a set of n multi-epoch signals with specified mutual correlations. Evoked parts, oscillatory parts and global envelopes of the signals can be controlled independently in order to obtain desired properties of the generated time courses.\n\nConclusionThe procedure provides versatile sets of mutually correlated signals suitable for modeling task-related brain activity.\n\nSignificanceIn contrast to other methods often relying on complicated computations, the suggested approach is straightforward and easy to apply in everyday practical work, yet yielding realistic \"functionally connected\" simulated brain signals.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle plays a central role in the regulation of systemic metabolism during lifespan. With aging, muscle mediated metabolic homeostasis is perturbed, contributing to the onset of multiple chronic diseases. Our knowledge on the mechanisms responsible for this age-related perturbation is limited, as it is difficult to distinguish between correlation and causality of molecular changes in muscle aging. Glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase 1 (GPCPD1) is a highly abundant muscle enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of the lipid glycerophosphocholine (GPC). The physiological function of GPCPD1 remained largely unknown. Here, we report that the GPCPD1-GPC metabolic pathway is dramatically perturbed in the aged muscle. Muscle-specific inactivation of Gpcpd1 resulted in severely affected glucose metabolism, without affecting muscle development. This pathology was muscle specific and did not occur in white fat-, brown fat- and liver-deficient Gpcpd1 deficient mice. Moreover, in the muscle specific mutant mice, glucose intolerance was markedly accelerated under high sugar and high fat diet. Mechanistically, Gpcpd1 deficiency results in accumulation of GPC, without any other significant changes in the global lipidome. This causes an \"aged-like\" transcriptomic signature in young Gpcpd1 deficient muscles and impaired insulin signaling. Finally, we report that GPC levels are markedly perturbed in muscles from both aged humans and patients with Type 2 diabetes, with a high correlation between GPC levels and increased chronological age. Our findings show the novel and critical physiological function of GPCPD1-GPC metabolic pathway to glucose metabolism, and the perturbation of this pathway with aging, which may contribute to glucose intolerance in aging.",

We propose a dynamic community FBA model where species compete for metabolites to grow off of without needing to cooperate to maximize a community-level objective. An efficient method for computing steady state community compositions is provided, as well as methods for determining the stability of a steady state community to perturbations in biomass and invasion by species outside the community. The model and methods are applied to a model of four E. coli mutants with elements of competition (for shared metabolites) and cooperation (via mutants being auxotrophic for metabolites exported by other mutants), as well as a nine-species gut microbiome model.",

The growing availability of human neuronal and circuit data provides opportunities for uncovering age-dependent changes of brain networks and for constraining models to predict consequences on brain activity. Here we found increased sag voltage amplitude in human middle temporal gyrus layer 5 pyramidal neurons from older subjects, and captured this effect in biophysical models of younger and older pyramidal neurons. We used these models to simulate detailed layer 5 microcircuits and found lower baseline firing in older pyramidal neuron microcircuits, with minimal effect on response. We then validated the predicted reduced baseline firing using extracellular multi-electrode recordings from human brain slices of different ages. Our results thus report changes in human pyramidal neuron input integration properties and provide fundamental insights on the neuronal mechanisms of altered cortical excitability and resting state activity in human aging.",

Although much has been learned about their physiology and their Madagascar ecology and phylogeny, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA-sequencing to profile 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs and tissues opportunistically procured from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration, and expert cell annotation, we defined and biologically organized over 750 mouse lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. These include cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and the developmental programs for spermatogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other adult tissues. We also described dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types and subtypes. We globally compared cell type expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explored primate cell type evolution by comparing mouse lemur cell profiles to those of the homologous cells in human and mouse. This revealed cell type specific patterns of primate cell specialization even within a single tissue compartment, as well as many cell types for which lemur provides a better human model than mouse. The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this primate model organism, and establishes a general approach for other emerging model organisms.",

During the processing of cells and tissues, long lasting gas bubbles randomly appeared around the laser focal point, however physicochemical and mechanical effects of the gas bubbles has not been emphasized. This paper presents characteristic behaviors of the gas gabbles and their contact effects on cell viability. High-speed imaging of the gas bubble formation with various additives in physiological medium confirms that the gas bubble consists of dissolved air, and amphipathic proteins stabilize the bubble surface. This surface protective layer reduces interactions of gas bubbles and cell membranes. Consequently, the gas bubble contact does not cause critical effects on cell viability. On the other hands, burst of gas bubbles stimulated by an impact of femtosecond laser induced cavitation can lead to liquid jet flow that might cause serious mechanical damages on cells. These results provide insights for the parameter of biological tissue processing with intense fs laser pulses.",

    "abstract": "For enumerating viable bacteria, traditional dilution plating to count colony forming units (CFU) has always been the preferred method in microbiology owing to its simplicity, albeit laborious and time-consuming. Similar CFU counts can be obtained by quantifying growing micro-colonies in conjunction with the perks of a microscope. Here, we employed a simple method of five microliter spotting of differently diluted bacterial culture multiple times on a single Petri dish followed by finding out CFU by counting micro-colonies using a phase-contrast microscope. In this method, the CFU of an Escherichia coli culture can be estimated within a four-hour period. Further, within a ten-hour period, CFU in a culture of Ralstonia solanacearum, a bacterium with a generation time of around 2 h, can be estimated. The CFU number determined by micro-colonies observed is comparable with that obtained by the dilution plating method. Micro-colonies number observed in the early hours of growth (2 h in case of E. coli and 8 h in case of R. solanacearum) were found to remain consistent at later hours, though there was a noticeable increase in the size of the colonies. It suggested that micro-colonies observed in the early hours indeed represent the bacterial number in the culture. Practical applications to this counting method were employed in studying the rifampicin-resistant mutation rate as well as performing the fluctuation test in E. coli. The method described here results in a 90% reduction of labour, time and resources. Thus, the method is likely to be adopted by many microbiologists in their routine laboratory research.",

To this end, we studied how monkeys switched between three rules. Each rule was compositional, requiring the animal to discriminate one of two features of a stimulus and then respond with an associated eye movement along one of two different response axes. By modeling behavior we found the animals learned the axis of response using fast inference (rule switching) while continuously re-estimating the stimulus-response associations within an axis (rule learning).

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to investigate a genome at the cellular level with unprecedented resolution. An organism consists of a heterogeneous collection of cell types, each of which plays a distinct role in various biological processes. Hence, the first step of scRNA-seq data analysis is often to distinguish cell types so they can be investigated separately. Researchers have recently developed several automated cell type annotation tools, requiring neither biological knowledge nor subjective human decisions. Dropout is a crucial characteristic of scRNA-seq data widely used in differential expression analysis. However, dropout information is not explicitly used by any current cell annotation method. Fully utilizing dropout information for cell type annotation motivated this work.\n\nResultsWe present scAnnotate, a cell annotation tool that fully utilizes dropout information. We model every genes marginal distribution using a mixture model, which describes both the dropout proportion and the distribution of the non-dropout expression levels. Then, using an ensemble machine learning approach, we combine the mixture models of all genes into a single model for cell-type annotation. This combining approach can avoid estimating numerous parameters in the high-dimensional joint distribution of all genes. Using fourteen real scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate that scAnnotate is competitive against nine existing annotation methods. Furthermore, because of its distinct modelling strategy, scAnnotates misclassified cells are very different from competitor methods. This suggests using scAnnotate together with other methods could further improve annotation accuracy.\n\nAvailabilityWe implemented scAnnotate as an R package and made it publicly available from CRAN.\n\nContactXuekui Zhang: xuekui@uvic.ca and Li Xing: li.xing@math.usask.ca",

These thymocytes have previously been revealed to be a heterogenous mixture of cells, which of only the CD117+ fraction have been proposed to be true T cell progenitors that progress to the DN2 and DN3 thymocyte stages, at which point the development of the {beta} and {gamma}{delta} T cell lineages diverge. However, recently, it has been shown that at least some {gamma}{delta} T cells are actually derived from a subset of CD117- DN thymocytes. Along with other ambiguities, this suggests that T cell development may not be as straightforward as previously thought. To better understand early T cell development, particularly the heterogeneity of DN1 thymocytes, we performed single cell RNA sequence (scRNAseq) of mouse DN and {gamma}{delta} thymocytes and show that the various DN stages are indeed comprised of transcriptionally diverse subpopulations of cells. We also show that multiple subpopulations of DN1 thymocytes exhibit preferential development towards the {gamma}{delta} lineage. Furthermore, specific {gamma}{delta}-primed DN1 subpopulations preferentially develop into IL-17 or IFN{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells. We show that DN1 subpopulations that only give rise to IL-17-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells already express many of the transcription factors associated with type 17 immune cell differentiation, while the DN1 subpopulations that can give rise to IFN{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cell already express transcription factors associated with type 1 immune cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing that diverse morphologies of neurons are reminiscent of structures of branched polymers, we put forward a principled and systematic way of classifying neurons that employs the ideas of polymer physics. In particular, we use 3D coordinates of individual neurons, which are accessible in recent neuron reconstruction datasets from electron microscope images. We numerically calculate the form factor, F (q), a Fourier transform of the distance distribution of particles comprising an object of interest, which is routinely measured in scattering experiments to quantitatively characterize the structure of materials. For a polymer-like object consisting of n monomers spanning over a length scale of r, F (q) scales with the wavenumber q(= 2{pi}/r) as F (q) [~] q-[D] at an intermediate range of q, where [D] is the fractal dimension or the inverse scaling exponent ([D] ={nu} -1) characterizing the geometrical feature (r [~] n{nu}) of the object. F (q) can be used to describe a neuron morphology in terms of its size (Rn) and the extent of branching quantified by [D]. By defining the distance between F (q)s as a measure of similarity between two neuronal morphologies, we tackle the neuron classification problem. In comparison with other existing classification methods for neuronal morphologies, our F (q)-based classification rests solely on 3D coordinates of neurons with no prior knowledge of morphological features. When applied to publicly available neuron datasets from three different organisms, our method not only complements other methods but also offers a physical picture of how the dendritic and axonal branches of an individual neuron fill the space of dense neural networks inside the brain.",

    "abstract": "Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) has become a popular method for visualising population structure due to its simplicity, computational speed, and freedom from demographic assumptions. Despite the popularity of DAPC, there has been little discussion on best practise. In this work, I provide guidelines for standardising the use of DAPC in studies of population genetic structure. An often-overlooked fact is that DAPC generates a model describing the genetic differences among a set of populations defined by a researcher. I demonstrate that appropriate parameterisation of this model is critical for obtaining biologically meaningful results. I show that the number of leading PC axes used as predictors of among population differences, paxes, should not exceed the k - 1 biologically informative PC axes that are expected for k effective populations in a genotype dataset. This k - 1 criterion for paxes selection is more appropriate compared to the widely used proportional variance criterion, which often results in a choice of paxes >> k - 1. DAPC parameterised with no more than the leading k - 1 PC axes is: (1) more parsimonious; (2) captures maximal among-population variation on biologically relevant predictors; (3) less sensitive to unintended interpretations of population structure; and (4) more generally applicable to independent sample sets. Assessing model fit should be routine practise and can aid interpretation of population structure when implementing DAPC. Additionally, it is imperative that researchers clearly articulate their study goals, that is, testing a priori expectations versus studying de novo inferred populations. Distinguishing between these goals is important because it dictates whether a researchers results can be treated as a test of the hypothesis that significant genetic differences exist among populations. Defining populations a priori (before observing the genotype data) constitutes a true hypothesis test, but populations defined de novo (after observing the genotype data) cannot be used to test this hypothesis due to issues with circularity. The discussion and practical recommendations provided in this work provide the molecular ecology community a roadmap for applying DAPC to their genotype datasets.",

    "abstract": "Working Memory (WM) is a capacity- and duration-limited system that forms a temporal bridge between fleeting sensory phenomena and possible actions. But how are the contents of WM used to guide behavior? A recent high-profile study reported evidence for simultaneous access to WM content and linked motor plans during WM-guided behavior, challenging serial models where task-relevant WM content is first selected and then mapped on to a task-relevant motor response. However, the task used in that study was not optimized to distinguish the selection of spatial versus non-spatial visual information stored in memory, nor to distinguish whether or how the chronometry of selecting non-spatial visual information stored in memory might differ from the selection of linked motor plans. Here, we revisited the chronometry of spatial, feature, and motor selection during WM-guided behavior using a task optimized to disentangle these processes. Concurrent EEG and eye position recordings revealed clear evidence for temporally dissociable spatial, feature, and motor selection mechanisms during this task, partially replicating yet also extending previous findings. More generally, our data reveal the existence of multiple WM selection mechanisms that belie conceptualizations of WM-guided behavior based on purely serial or parallel visuomotor processing.",

Repeatable individual chronotypes have been linked to performance in humans but, in free-living species, benefits of chronotype are poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated fitness correlates of incubation patterns in female songbirds (great tit, Parus major) at urban and forest sites. We confirm repeatable chronotypes (r [&ge;] 0.31) and show novel links between chronotype and reproductive success. In both habitats, females that started activity earlier in the day raised more fledglings. We also observed that forest females started their day at a similar time throughout the breeding season, whereas urban females tied their onset of activity closely to sunrise. Our study points to possible mechanisms that underlie chronotype variation and provides sought-after evidence for its relevance to fitness.",

    "abstract": "Lipid transfer between organelles requires proteins that shield the hydrophobic portions of lipids as they cross the cytoplasm. In the last decade a new structural form of lipid transfer protein (LTP) has been found: long hydrophobic grooves made of beta-sheet that bridge between organelles at membrane contact sites. Eukaryotes have five families of bridge-like LTPs: VPS13, ATG2, SHIP164, Hobbit and Tweek. These are unified into a single superfamily through their bridges being composed of just one domain, called the repeating beta groove (RBG) domain, which builds into rod shaped multimers with a hydrophobic-lined groove and hydrophilic exterior. Here, sequences and predicted structures of the RBG superfamily were analyzed in depth. Phylogenetics showed that the last eukaryotic common ancestor contained all five RBG proteins, with duplicate VPS13s. These appear to have arisen in even earlier ancestors from shorter forms with 4 RBG domains. The extreme ends of most RBG proteins have amphipathic helices that might be an adaptation for direct or indirect bilayer interaction, although this has yet to be tested. The one exception to this is the C-terminus of SHIP164, which instead has a coiled-coil. Finally, almost the entire length of the exterior surfaces of the RBG bridges are shown to have conserved residues, indicating sites for partner interactions almost all of which are unknown. These findings can inform future cell biological and biochemical experiments.",

    "abstract": "The enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolises approximately 25% of commonly prescribed drugs, including analgesics, anti-hypertensives, and anti-depressants, among many others. Genetic variation in drug metabolising genes can alter how an individual responds to prescribed drugs, including predisposing to adverse drug reactions. The majority of research on the CYP2D6 gene has been carried out in European and East Asian populations, with Indigenous and minority populations greatly underrepresented. However, genetic variation is often population specific and analysis of diverse ethnic groups can reveal differences in alleles that may be of clinical significance. For this reason, we set out to examine the range and frequency of CYP2D6 variants in a sample of 202 M[a]ori and Pacific people living in Aotearoa (New Zealand). We carried out a long PCR to isolate the CYP2D6 region before performing nanopore sequencing to identify all variants and alleles in these samples. We identified eleven novel variants, three of which were exonic missense variations. Six of these occurred in single samples and one was found in 19 samples (9.4% of the cohort). The remaining four novel variants were identified in two samples each. In addition, five new suballeles of CYP2D6 were identified. One striking finding was that CYP2D6*71, an allele of unknown functional status which has been rarely observed in previous studies, occurs at a relatively high frequency (9.2%) within this cohort. These data will help to ensure that CYP2D6 genetic analysis for pharmacogenetic purposes can be carried out accurately and effectively in this population group.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells are defined by their ability to self-renew and to differentiate, both shown in multiple studies to be regulated by metabolic processes. To decipher metabolic signatures of self-renewal in blastocyst-derived stem cells, we compared early differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their extra-embryonic counterparts - trophoblast (T)SCs to their self-renewing counterparts. A metabolomics analysis pointed to the desaturation of fatty acyl chains as a metabolic signature of differentiating blastocyst-derived SCs via the upregulation of delta-6 desaturase (D6D; FADS2) and delta-5 desaturase (D5D; FADS1), key enzymes in the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The inhibition of D6D or D5D by specific inhibitors or SiRNA retained stemness in ESCs and TSCs, and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related apoptosis. D6D inhibition upregulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (Scd1) in ESCs, essential to maintain ER homeostasis. In TSCs, however, D6D inhibition downregulated Scd1. TSCs show higher Scd1 mRNA expression and high levels of monounsaturated fatty acyl chain products in comparison to ESCs. Addition of oleic acid - the product of Scd1 (essential for ESCs), to culture medium, was detrimental to TSCs. Interestingly, TSCs express a high molecular mass variant of Scd1 protein, hardly expressed by ESCs. Taken together, our data point to lipid desaturation as a metabolic regulator of the balance between differentiation and self-renewal of ESCs and TSCs. They point to lipid polydesaturation as a driver of differentiation in both cell types. In contrast, mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), known to be essential for ESCs are detrimental to TSCs.",

However, traditional multi-tissue integration methods cannot handle uncollected tissues or rely on genotype information, which is subject to privacy concerns and often unavailable. To address these challenges, we present HYFA (Hypergraph Factorisation), a novel method for joint imputation of multi-tissue and cell-type gene expression. HYFA imputes tissue-specific gene expression via a specialised graph neural network operating on a hypergraph of individuals, metagenes, and tissues. HYFA is genotype- agnostic, supports a variable number of collected tissues per individual, and imposes strong inductive biases to leverage the shared regulatory architecture of tissues. In performance comparison on data from the Genotype Tissue Expression project, HYFA achieves superior performance over existing transcriptome imputation methods, especially when multiple reference tissues are available. Through transfer learning on a paired single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) dataset, we further show that HYFA can accurately resolve cell-type signatures from bulk gene expression, highlighting the methods ability to leverage gene expression programs underlying cell-type identity, even in tissues that were never observed in the training set. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we find that the metagenes learned by HYFA capture information about known biological pathways. Notably, the HYFA-imputed dataset can be used to identify regulatory genetic variations (eQTLs), with substantial gains over the original incomplete dataset.

    "abstract": "Influenza virus has resurfaced recently from inactivity during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, raising serious concerns about the nature and magnitude of future epidemics. The main antigenic targets of influenza virus are two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Whereas the structural and dynamical properties of both glycoproteins have been studied previously, the understanding of their plasticity in the whole-virion context is fragmented. Here, we investigate the dynamics of influenza glycoproteins in a crowded protein environment through mesoscale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of two evolutionary-linked glycosylated influenza A whole-virion models. Our simulations reveal and kinetically characterize three main molecular motions of influenza glycoproteins: NA head tilting, HA ectodomain tilting, and HA head breathing. The flexibility of HA and NA highlights antigenically relevant conformational states, as well as facilitates the characterization of a novel monoclonal antibody, derived from human convalescent plasma, that binds to the underside of the NA head. Our work provides previously unappreciated views on the dynamics of HA and NA, advancing the understanding of their interplay and suggesting possible strategies for the design of future vaccines and antivirals against influenza.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryIn situ dynamics of influenza glycoproteins expose antigenically relevant states and a new site of vulnerability in neuraminidase.",

Because VTC also exhibits selectivity for objects, we here extend this framework to test whether MPC also shows object selectivity during recall. Robust people and place recall effects were evident in MPC, but we found no evidence for object-recall within MPC, suggesting that MPC and VTC are not mirror-copies of each other. Together, these data suggest that the functional organization of MPC reflects the most salient categorical representations within VTC for people and places.",

    "abstract": "Integrons are adaptive bacterial devices that rearrange promoter less gene cassettes into variable ordered arrays under stress conditions, to sample combinatorial phenotypic diversity. Chromosomal integrons often carry hundreds of silent gene cassettes, with integrase-mediated recombination leading to rampant DNA excision and integration, posing a potential threat to genome integrity. How this activity is regulated and controlled, particularly through selective pressures, to maintain such large cassette arrays is unknown. Here we show a key role of promoter-containing toxin-antitoxin (TA) cassettes as abortive systems that kill the cell when the overall cassette excision rate is too high. These results highlight the importance of TA cassettes regulating the cassette recombination dynamics and provide insight into the evolution and success of integrons in bacterial genomes.\n\nTeaserThe accumulation of cassette functions in integrons is ensured by toxin-antitoxin systems which kill the cell when the cassette excision rate is too high.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora species cause severe diseases on food, forest, and ornamental crops. Since the genus was described in 1875, it has expanded to comprise over 190 formally described species. There is a need for an open access bioinformatic tool that centralizes diverse streams of sequence data and metadata to facilitate research and identification of Phytophthora species. We used the Tree-Based Alignment Selector Toolkit (T-BAS) to develop a phylogeny of 192 formally described species and 33 informal taxa in the genus Phytophthora using sequences of eight nuclear genes. The phylogenetic tree was inferred using the RAxML maximum likelihood method. A search engine was also developed to identify genotypes of P. infestans based on genetic distance to known lineages. The T-BAS tool provides a visualization framework allowing users to place unknown isolates on a curated phylogeny of all Phytophthora species. Critically, this resource can be updated in real-time to keep pace with new species descriptions. The tool contains metadata such as clade, host species, substrate, sexual characteristics, distribution, and reference literature, which can be visualized on the tree and downloaded for other uses. This phylogenetic resource will allow data sharing among research groups and the database will enable the global Phytophthora community to upload sequences and determine the phylogenetic placement of an isolate within the larger phylogeny and to download sequence data and metadata. The database will be curated by a community of Phytophthora researchers and housed on the T-BAS web portal in the Center for Integrated Fungal Research at NC State. The T-BAS web tool can be leveraged to create similar metadata enhanced phylogenies for diverse populations of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Humans possess remarkable prosocial tendencies beyond the confinement of kinship, which may be instrumental in promoting cooperative interactions and sociality at large. Yet, prosociality is an evolutionary conundrum as it does not provide immediate benefits to the actor. The  domestication and  cooperative-breeding hypotheses postulated that enhanced social tolerance and inter-individual dependence could nonetheless facilitate the evolution of prosociality. However, inconsistent results due to varying experimental paradigms, and restricted focus of research on tolerant and cooperatively breeding species, have impeded our understanding so far. Albeit counterintuitively, despotic societies with relatively low social tolerance levels represent an excellent opportunity to investigate prosociality due to their kin favoritism and potential interdependence among individuals in terms of social support. Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) live in strictly hierarchical matrilineal societies, where kin members have strong social bonds. Additionally, support from non-kins can be crucial to form coalitions and rank up in the hierarchy. Using a group-service paradigm, we tested prosociality in a semi-free-ranging group of Japanese macaques. In contrast to currently existing evidence, we found that individuals (n=25) can act prosocially and at comparably high rates as cooperative breeding- or self-domesticated species. The macaques benefitted not only their kin members but other individuals to whom they showed relatively high social tolerance. We emphasize the roles of complex socio-ecological conditions in facilitating individual prosocial tendencies. Furthermore, these results call for a novel evolutionary framework regarding prosociality that focuses on different forms of interdependence and expands beyond cooperative breeding- and (self-)domesticated species.\n\nSignificance statementWhat made humans so incredibly prosocial? Examining the evolutionary trajectory of prosocial acts led comparative psychologists to explore various taxa. Empirical evidence so far suggests that enhanced social tolerance and interdependence among individuals facilitate prosociality. Conventionally, despotism is characterized by low group-level tolerance, yet kin favoritism, nepotism, and high interdependence (in support and coalition formation) are also fundamental properties of despotic societies. Under such complex socio-ecological conditions, individual prosocial acts could thus be vital. We found, for the first time, high levels of prosociality in the very despotic Japanese macaques. Individuals benefitted both kin-relatives and others to whom they showed relatively high dyadic social tolerance. This study signifies that prosociality can be favored even in a highly despotic society.",

    "abstract": "Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous lipid molecules that activate the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals primarily through the Gi/o family of G proteins to regulate neurotransmitter release. Consequently, CB1 is an important therapeutic target for several neurological disorders. How eCBs interact with CB1 is not known and the downstream signaling they activate is not well understood. In this study we show that eCBs do not activate Gi1 as much as synthetic cannabinoids. To characterize activation of CB1 by eCB, we formed an eCB analogue-bound (AMG315) CB1-Gi signaling complex for structural studies. The structure reveals differences in the orthosteric ligand binding pocket not seen in the previous CB1 structures, providing insights into the structural determinants of ligand efficacy. In combination with signaling and simulation data, this study provides mechanistic insights into CB1 activation by different classes of ligands, and sheds light on the G protein preferences between endogenous and exogenous ligands.",

Their read lengths, potentially spanning entire transcripts, is advantageous for reconstructing transcriptomes. Existing long-read transcriptome assembly methods are primarily reference-based and to date, there is little focus on reference-free transcriptome assembly. We introduce RNA-Bloom2, a reference-free assembly method for long-read transcriptome sequencing data. Using simulated datasets and spike-in control data, we show that the transcriptome assembly quality of RNA-Bloom2 is competitive to those of reference-based methods. Furthermore, RNA-Bloom2 requires 27.0 to 80.6% of the peak memory and 3.6 to 10.8% of the total wall-clock runtime of a competing reference-free method. Finally, we showcase RNA-Bloom2 in assembling a transcriptome sample of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce). Since our method does not rely on a reference, it sets up the groundwork for large-scale comparative transcriptomics where high-quality draft genome assemblies are not readily available.",

Efforts to further increase the FOV in fluorescence nanoscopy have thus far relied on the use of fabricated waveguide substrates, adding cost and sample constraints on the applications. Here we report PRism-Illumination and Microfluidics-Enhanced DNA-PAINT (PRIME-PAINT) for multiplexed fluorescence nanoscopy across millimeter-scale FOVs. Built upon the well-established prism-type total internal reflection microscopy, PRIME-PAINT achieves robust single-molecule localization with up to ~520 {micro}m x 520 {micro}m single FOVs and 25-40 nm lateral resolutions. Through stitching, nanoscopic imaging over mm2 sample areas can be completed in as little as 40 minutes per target. An on-stage microfluidics chamber facilitates probe exchange for multiplexing and enhances image quality particularly for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. We demonstrate the utility of PRIME-PAINT by analyzing ~106 caveolae structures in ~1,000 cells and imaging entire pancreatic cancer lesions from patient tissue biopsies. By imaging from nanometers to millimeters with multiplexity and broad sample compatibility, PRIME-PAINT will be useful for building multiscale, Google-Earth-like views of biological systems.",

We provide a pedagogical computation of 2 commonly used HRV metrics, i.e. the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and the standard deviation of RR intervals (SDRR), in terms of Fourier components. It is shown that the RMSSD preferentially weights higher frequency Fourier modes, making it unsuitable as a biosignal for mindful breathing meditation which encourages slow breathing. We propose a new metric called the autonomic balance index (ABI) which uses Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia to quantify the fraction of HRV contributed by the parasympathetic nervous system. We apply this metric to HRV data collected during two different meditation techniques, and show that the ABI is significantly elevated during mindful breathing, making it a good signal for biofeedback during meditation sessions.",

SWI/SNF complexes exist in three distinct families that each contribute to regulation of transcription, although the functional interactions between the families are not well understood. Rhabdoid tumors constitute an informative model system as these highly aggressive cancers are driven by inactivation of a single SWI/SNF subunit, SMARCB1, which is present in two SWI/SNF families (cBAF and PBAF) but not in the third (GBAF/ncBAF). We and others have shown that BRD9, a therapeutically targetable member of ncBAF, is essential specifically in SMARCB1-deficient cancers, suggesting key functional relationships between SMARCB1-containing complexes and BRD9/ncBAF. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of these relationships are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that genomic binding of BRD9 is largely dependent upon SMARCB1 such that the absence of SMARCB1 results in significantly reduced BRD9 binding. At select sites, however, we show that SMARCB1-loss results in gain of BRD9 binding and BRD9-dependent accessibility. We find that this gain is associated with expression of genes promoting cell migration. Our results define relationships between SWI/SNF complex families, elucidate mechanisms by which SMARCB1 loss drives oncogenesis, and provide mechanistic insight into the synthetic-lethal relationship between SMARCB1 and BRD9.",

    "abstract": "In-vivo toxicity assessment is an important step prior to clinical development and is still the main source of data for overall risk assessment of a new molecular entity (NCE). All in-vivo studies are performed according to regulatory requirements and many efforts have been exerted to minimize these studies in accordance with the (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) 3Rs principle. Many aspects of in-vivo toxicology packages can be optimized to reduce animal use, including the number of studies performed as well as study durations, which is the main focus of this analysis. We performed a statistical comparison of adverse findings observed in 116 short-term versus 78 long-term studies in order to explore the possibility of using only short-term studies as a prediction tool for the longer-term effects. Annotation of treatment related findings was one of the challenges faced during this work. A specific focus was therefore put on the summary and conclusion sections of the reports since they contain expert assessments on whether the findings were considered adverse or were attributed to other reasons. Our analysis showed a general good concordance between short-term and long-term toxicity findings for large molecules and the majority of small molecules.

    "abstract": "Relay intercropping of legumes with cereals is a useful technique for yield improvement. Intercropping may be affected the photosynthetic pigments, enzymes activity and yield of barley and chickpea under water stress. To investigate the effect of relay intercropping of barley with chickpea on pigments content, enzymes activity and yield under water stress, a field experiment as split plot based on a randomized complete block design was conducted during 2017 and 2018. The treatments included irrigation regimes (normal irrigation and cutting off irrigation at milk development stage) as main plot. Also, cropping systems consisted of sole cropping of barley in December (b1) and January (b2), sole cropping of chickpea in December (c1) and January (c2), barley + chickpea in December (b1c1), barley in December + chickpea in January (b1c2), barley in January + chickpea in December (b2c1) and barley + chickpea in January (b2c2) as sub plot. Chlorophyll a content of barley increased in b1c2, by consuming less water compared to sole cropping. In barley, sowing of barley in December intercropped with chickpea in December and January (b1c1 and b1c2) created a suitable canopy in pigment contents improvement. Late sowing of chickpea enhanced the carotenoid content of chickpea, catalase and peroxidase activities. Barley-chickpea intercropping reacted to water deficit through enzymes activity, water use efficiency and land equivalent enhancement compared to sole cropping. Under water stress, in b1c2, by increasing total chlorophyll and water use efficiency, grain yield of barley enhanced compared to b1. It seems that in b1c2, barley and chickpea response to water stress be increasing total chlorophyll and enzymes activity, respectively. In this relay intercropping treatment, each crop occupied and used the growth resources from different ecological niches at different times which is recommended in semi-arid areas.",

    "abstract": "Diastolic dysfunction is increasingly identified as a key, early onset subclinical condition characterizing cardiopathologies of rising prevalence, including diabetic heart disease and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Diastolic dysfunction characterization has important prognostic value in management of disease outcomes. Validated tools for in vivo monitoring of diastolic function in rodent models of diabetes are required for progress in pre-clinical cardiology studies. 2D speckle tracking echocardiography has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating cardiac wall deformation throughout the cardiac cycle. The aim of this study was to examine the applicability of 2D speckle tracking echocardiography for comprehensive global and regional assessment of diastolic function in a pre-clinical murine model of cardio-metabolic disease. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) was induced in C57Bl/6 male mice using a high fat high sugar dietary intervention for 20 weeks. Significant impairment in left ventricle peak diastolic strain rate was evident in longitudinal, radial and circumferential planes in T2D mice. Peak diastolic velocity was similarly impaired in the longitudinal and radial planes. Regional analysis of longitudinal peak diastolic strain rate revealed that the anterior free left ventricular wall is particularly susceptible to T2D-induced diastolic dysfunction. These findings provide a significant advance on characterization of diastolic dysfunction in a pre-clinical mouse model of cardiopathology and offer a comprehensive suite of benchmark values for future pre-clinical cardiology studies.",

    "abstract": "The ingestion of blood represents a significant pressure that immediately increases water, oxidative, and thermal stress, but provides a significant nutrient source to generate resources necessary for the development of progeny. Thermal stress has been assumed to solely be a negative byproduct that has to be alleviated to prevent stress. Here, we examined if the short thermal bouts incurred during a warm blood meal are beneficial to reproduction. To do so, we examined the duration of pregnancy and milk gland protein expression in the tsetse fly, Glossina morsitans, that consumed a warm or cool blood meal. We noted that an optimal temperature for blood ingestion yielded a reduction in the duration of pregnancy. This decline in the duration of pregnancy is due to increased rate of blood digestion when consuming warm blood. This increased digestion likely provided more energy that leads to increased expression of transcript for milk-associated proteins. The shorter duration of pregnancy is predicted to yield an increase in population growth compared to those that consume cool or above host temperatures. These studies provide evidence that consumption of a warm blood meal is likely beneficial for specific aspects of vector biology.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy functions as a crucial cellular scavenger by targeting cytoplasmic cargo to specific lysosome/vacuole for degradation. Autophagy-related (ATG) core proteins including ATG5 and ATG7 are evolutionarily conserved factors that are spatiotemporally orchestrated to regulate multiple processes of autophagy in yeast, mammalian and plant cells. However, autophagy is believed to be functionally dispensable in Arabidopsis thaliana since severe defects during plant growth, development and reproduction have not been observed in most of the ATG loss-of-function mutants, including atg5 and atg7, under standard cultivation conditions. In this study, we report that autophagy does in fact play roles in regulating pollen tube growth guidance and male fertility in Arabidopsis thaliana. A detailed re-assessment of atg5 and atg7 mutants revealed greatly reduced autophagy activity in germinated pollens and the seed formation within siliques is partially abolished. Next, we demonstrated that both the pollen germination ratio and pollen tube length of the mutants decreased at the beginning of germination by time-lapse tracking of pollen germination in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we observed occurrences of pollen tube twisting and stacking during their growth towards the ovules. Finally, we found abnormal pollen grains containing only a single sperm cell or an undivided generative nucleus. Collectively, these results indicate that ATG5- and ATG7-mediated autophagy is functionally involved in regulating pollen germination, tube growth guidance and sperm cell development in Arabidopsis thaliana.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodesmata (PD) are membrane-lined channels connecting adjoining plant cells. PD control symplasmic intercellular communication by allowing molecules to move between cells. Plant polysaccharide callose ({beta}-1,3-glucan) is deposited at PD, affecting plasmodesmal function; however, the regulation of PD at different cell interfaces is largely unknown. This study discovered that two PD-located proteins, PDLP5 and PDLP6, are expressed in non-overlapping cell types. The constitutive expression of PDLP5 and PDLP6 results in the overaccumulation of PD callose at different cell interfaces and starch hyperaccumulation in different cell types within mature leaves. Using a proximity labeling approach, we identified sucrose synthase 6 (SUS6) as a functional partner of PDLP6. We further demonstrated that PDLP6 physically and genetically interacts with SUS6. In addition, callose synthase 7 (CalS7) interacts with both SUS6 and PDLP6 and is required for PDLP6s function. We propose that PDLP6-SUS6-CalS7 forms a callose synthase complex in the vasculature to regulate the plasmodesmal function.",

    "abstract": "Research in Neuroscience, as in many scientific disciplines, is undergoing a renaissance based on deep learning. Unique to Neuroscience, deep learning models can be used not only as a tool but interpreted as models of the brain. The central claims of recent deep learning-based models of brain circuits are that they make novel predictions about neural phenomena or shed light on the fundamental functions being optimized. We show, through the case-study of grid cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, that one may get neither. We begin by reviewing the principles of grid cell mechanism and function obtained from first-principles modeling efforts, then rigorously examine the claims of deep learning models of grid cells. Using large-scale architectural and hyperparameter sweeps and theory-driven experimentation, we demonstrate that the results of such models may be more strongly driven by particular, non-fundamental, and post-hoc implementation choices than fundamental truths about neural circuits or the loss function(s) they might optimize. We discuss why these models cannot be expected to produce accurate models of the brain without the addition of substantial amounts of inductive bias, an informal No Free Lunch result for Neuroscience. Based on first principles work, we provide hypotheses for what additional loss functions will produce grid cells more robustly. In conclusion, circumspection and transparency, together with biological knowledge, are warranted in building and interpreting deep learning models in Neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual history plays an important role in sensory processing and decision making, shaping how we perceive and judge external objects and events. Indeed, past stimuli can bias what we are currently seeing in an attractive fashion, making a current stimulus to appear more similar to its preceding one than it actually is. Such attractive effects across successive stimuli appear to be ubiquitous, affecting almost every aspect of perception - from very basic visual attributes (i.e., orientation) to more complex features (i.e., face identity) - suggesting that they may reflect a fundamental principle of brain processing. However, it is unclear whether the ubiquitous nature of these effects is due to an underlying centralised mechanism mediating all of them, or by the existence of separate mechanisms implemented independently in different perceptual pathways. Here we address this question by assessing the behavioural and neural signature of perceptual history in audition and vision, in the context of time perception. Our results first show a double dissociation between the two modalities, whereby the behavioural effect of perceptual history shows opposite patterns of selectivity for the features and position of the stimuli. Electroencephalography results further support a difference between audition and vision, demonstrating that the signature of perceptual history unfolds according to different dynamics in the two modalities and show different relations with the behavioural effect. Overall, our results suggest that the effect of perceptual history may be mediated by different and at least partially independent mechanisms based on the same computational principle, implemented in different sensory pathways.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe recent history of stimulation, or perceptual history, plays a fundamental role in perception, shaping what we see according to what we saw in the past. The brain mechanisms mediating the integration of past and present perceptual information are however still unclear. In this study we asked whether perceptual history operates via a centralized mechanism shared across sensory modalities, or via distinct modality-specific mechanisms. Our findings show a double dissociation in attractive perceptual history effects across vision and audition, while EEG data show neural signatures of perceptual history with distinct dynamics and properties. Overall, we thus demonstrate that perceptual history affects sensory processing starting from the earliest level of processing, within distinct modality-specific sensory pathways.",

Yet, the world appears stable and vision remains normal. We discovered a neural strategy for rotational stability in anterior inferotemporal cortex (IT), the final stage of object vision in primates. We measured object orientation tuning of IT neurons in macaque monkeys tilted +25 and -25{degrees} laterally, producing [~]40{degrees} difference in retinal image orientation. Among IT neurons with consistent object orientation tuning, 63% remained stable with respect to gravity across tilts. Gravitational tuning depended on vestibular/somatosensory but also visual cues, consistent with previous evidence that IT processes scene cues for gravitys orientation. In addition to stability across image rotations, an internal gravitational reference frame is important for physical understanding of a world where object position, posture, structure, shape, movement, and behavior interact critically with gravity.",

When neurons co-express an activity reporter (e.g. calcium or voltage-sensitive indicators) and an (excitatory or inhibitory) opsin, such \"all optical\" interrogation approaches in vivo allows to draw causal links between function of cell-type specific microcircuits and behaviour. However, the net effects of near-infrared stimulation on network activity per se remain to be adequately investigated in vivo. Here we show that multicell holographic photostimulation with near-infrared radiation with total powers to sample used in current literature halves the spike rate of the non-illuminated neurons in label-free mouse cortex in vivo. The effect is not mediated by GABA release, but depends on NIR-dependent gating of potassium channels as it is absent when neurons are intracellularly perfused with the broad potassium channel blocker cesium ions, and are possibly mediated by heating. The phenomenon may contribute to set an upper limit to holographic photostimulation efficacy, calls for the need to control the effects of holographic stimulation protocols per se in label free preparations, and might be of relevance to interpret the therapeutical effects on infrared stimulation in psychiatry and neurology.\n\nHighlights- Holographic multi-cell, infrared illumination halves spike rates of no-target neurons\n- The effect happens with total powers to sample used in \"all-optical\" literature\n- Infrared-driven spike killing is GABA-independent but depends on potassium channels",

    "abstract": "The standard method for sleep state classification is thresholding amplitudes of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), followed by an experts manual correction. Although popular, the method entails some shortcomings: 1) the time-consuming manual correction by human experts is sometimes a bottleneck hindering sleep studies; 2) EEG electrodes on the skull interfere with wide-field imaging of the cortical activity of a head-fixed mouse under a microscope; 3) invasive surgery to fix the electrodes on the thin skull of a mouse risks brain tissue injury; and 4) metal electrodes for EEG and EMG are difficult to apply to some experiment apparatus such as that for functional magnetic resonance imaging. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a pupil dynamics-based vigilance state classification for a head-fixed mouse using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a variant of recurrent neural networks, for multi-class labeling of NREM, REM, and WAKE states. For supervisory hypnography, EEG and EMG recording were performed for a head-fixed mouse, combined with left eye pupillometry using a USB camera and a markerless tracking toolbox, DeepLabCut. Our open-source LSTM model with feature inputs of pupil diameter, location, velocity, and eyelid opening for 10 s at a 10 Hz sampling rate achieved vigilance state estimation with a higher classification performance (macro F1 score, 0.77; accuracy, 86%) than a feed forward neural network. Findings from diverse pupillary dynamics implied subdivision of a vigilance state defined by EEG and EMG. Pupil dynamics-based hypnography can expand the scope of alternatives for sleep stage scoring of head fixed mice.",

Water containing or lacking Ganoderma lucidum was inoculated with twenty antibiotics from six different classes. The extent of antibiotic removal was measured at baseline and after 3 days with ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry. In water containing Ganoderma lucidum mycelial biomass, we found a significant reduction compared to the baseline of the concentration in six (three quinolones and three sulfonamides) out of twenty tested antibiotics by Day 3, with normalized changes ranging from -24.4% to -82.4%. The mycelial biomass was particularly effective in reducing the presence of three quinolone antibiotics, a class of highly used antibiotics recalcitrant to processes in wastewater treatment plants. Our findings provide a novel approach to degrade certain antibiotics from water.

    "abstract": "Plague is a rapidly deteriorating contagious disease that has killed millions of people during the history of mankind and is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis. Currently, the disease is treated effectively with antibiotics. However, in the case of an outbreak caused by a multiple-antibiotic-resistant strain, alternative countermeasures are required. Despite the many efforts to develop a safe vaccine against the disease, there is still no vaccine approved for use in western countries. mRNA Lipid Nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) vaccines have been demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic to be a versatile, clinically relevant, and rapidly manufactured vaccine platform. However, harnessing this platform for bacterial pathogens remains a formidable challenge. Here, we describe the design of several mRNA-LNP vaccine versions against Y. pestis, based on the F1 capsular antigen. We demonstrate that mRNA-LNP vaccines encoding the F1 antigen with either no signal sequences or conjugated to human Fc, provide substantial cellular and humoral responses. Most importantly, these vaccine candidates fully protect animals against Y. pestis infection. The results of this study suggest that mRNA-LNPs can be effective as anti-bacterial vaccines, and further developed to combat other bacterial pathogens, which are urgently needed, given the looming threat of antibiotic resistance.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA novel mRNA-LNP vaccine against Y. pestis, the etiological agent of plague and the first documented mRNA-LNP vaccine to protect against a lethal bacterial pathogen infection.",

The essential oils were obtained separately from both the aerial parts and seeds of the plant using the hydrodistillation method. Antimicrobial activity was determined using the disk diffusion method. Total antioxidant level (TAS), total oxidant level (TOS), and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity were detected for the antioxidant activity of the plant. The main essential oil components of the above-ground parts Hyoscyamus niger were determined as major components the phytol 52.09%, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone 19.66 %. H. niger seeds were hydrodistilled separately, obtaining yields of 0.7% (v w-1) of yellow oils. In the essential oils of H. niger seeds, forty-one components were identified representing 99.0% of the oils. According to the results of the analysis hexahydrofarnesyl acetone 46.36%, hexanal 9.05% as major components. It was determined that the methanol extracts of the above-ground H. niger inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms at different rates (13-32 mm). TAS value of methanol extracts of H. niger was calculated as 3.7705 mmol, while the TOS value was calculated as 6.9403 mol. It was determined that the scavenging effects of the DPPH radical increase, depend on increasing concentrations.",

Here, we found that the glycolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is a major component of Uukuniemi phenuivirus and allows viral binding to host cells. A lipidomic analysis with mass spectrometry revealed the lipidome of UUKV particles and indicated that GlcCer was enriched in both infected cells and viral particles. In addition, the infectivity of UUKV depended on the conversion of ceramide (Cer) into GlcCer in the Golgi network of producer cells. In contrast, depletion of GlcCer in virions profoundly impaired the attachment of UUKV and other related viruses to target cells. Furthermore, competing GlcCer ligands prevented virus binding to various cell types. Altogether, our results demonstrate that glycolipids are essential structural determinants of the virions necessary for virus attachment to host cells and have strong implications for future work on the identification of virus receptors.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of mRNA polyadenylation is important for response to external signals and differentiation in several cell types, and results in mRNA isoforms that vary in the amount of coding sequence or 3 UTR regulatory elements. However, its role in differentiation of monocytes to macrophages has not been investigated. Macrophages are key effectors of the innate immune system that help control infection and promote tissue-repair. However, overactivity of macrophages contributes to pathogenesis of many diseases. In this study, we show that macrophage differentiation is characterized by shortening and lengthening of mRNAs in relevant cellular pathways. The cleavage/polyadenylation (C/P) proteins increase during differentiation, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed changes in poly(A) site usage. This was surprising since higher C/P protein levels correlate with higher proliferation rates in other systems, but monocytes stop dividing after induction of differentiation. Depletion of CstF64, a C/P protein and known regulator of polyadenylation efficiency, delayed macrophage marker expression, cell cycle exit, attachment, and acquisition of structural complexity, and impeded shortening of mRNAs with functions relevant to macrophage biology. Conversely, CstF64 overexpression increased use of promoter-proximal poly(A) sites and caused the appearance of differentiated phenotypes in the absence of induction. Our findings indicate that regulation of polyadenylation plays an important role in macrophage differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells, SCs) are essential for muscle regeneration and the regenerative activities of SCs are intrinsically governed by gene regulatory mechanisms but the post-transcriptional regulation in SCs remains largely unknown. N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNAs is the most pervasive and highly conserved RNA modification in eukaryotic cells and exerts powerful impact on almost all aspects of mRNA processing which is mainly endowed by its binding with m6A reader proteins. Here in this study, we investigate the previously uncharacterized regulatory roles of YTHDC1, a m6A reader in SCs. Our results demonstrate YTHDC1 is an essential regulator of SC activation and proliferation upon acute injury induced muscle regeneration. The induction of YTHDC1 is indispensable for SC activation and proliferation thus inducible YTHDC1 depletion almost abolishes SC regenerative capacity. Mechanistically, transcriptome-wide profiling using LACE-seq in both SCs and C2C12 myoblasts identifies m6A mediated binding targets of YTHDC1. Next, splicing analysis defines splicing mRNA targets of m6A-YTHDC1. Furthermore, nuclear export analysis also leads to identification of potential mRNA export targets of m6A-YTHDC1 in SCs and C2C12 myoblasts and interestingly some mRNAs can be regulated at both splicing and export levels. Lastly, we map YTHDC1 interacting protein partners in myoblasts and unveil a myriad of factors governing mRNA splicing, nuclear export and transcription, among which hnRNPG appears to be a bona fide interacting partner of YTHDC1. Altogether, our findings uncover YTHDC1 as an essential factor controlling SC regenerative ability through multi-faceted gene regulatory mechanisms in myoblast cells.",

    "abstract": "A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 is the most common monogenic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A hallmark of ALS/FTD pathology is the presence of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, produced from both sense GGGGCC (poly-GA, poly-GP, poly-GR) and antisense CCCCGG (poly-PR, poly-PG, poly-PA) transcripts. Although initiation codons and regulatory factors have been identified for sense DPR translation, they remain mostly unknown for antisense DPRs. Here, we show that an AUG initiation codon is necessary for poly-PR synthesis, suggesting canonical AUG dependent translation. Remarkably, although an AUG located 194 base pairs (bp) upstream of the repeat is the main start codon for poly-PG synthesis, two other AUG codons (-212 bp, -113 bp) can also initiate translation, demonstrating a striking redundancy in start codon usage. eIF2D is required for CUG start codon-dependent poly-GA translation from the sense transcript in human motor neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD patients, but AUG-dependent poly-PG or poly-PR synthesis does not require eIF2D, indicating that distinct translation initiation factors control DPR synthesis from sense and antisense transcripts. Our findings provide key molecular insights into DPR synthesis from the C9ORF72 locus, which may be broadly applicable to many other nucleotide-repeat expansion disorders.",

    "abstract": "Intermediate filaments (IFs) are major components of the metazoan cytoskeleton. A long-standing debate concerns the question whether IF network organization only reflects or also determines cell and tissue function. Using C. elegans, we have recently described mutants of the MAPK SMA-5, which perturb the organization of the intestinal IF cytoskeleton resulting in luminal widening and cytoplasmic invaginations. Besides these structural phenotypes, systemic dysfunctions were also observed. We now identify the IF polypeptide IFB-2 as a highly efficient suppressor of both the structural and functional deficiencies by removing the aberrant IF network. Mechanistically, IF network morphogenesis is linked to the phosphorylated IFB-2 aminoterminus. The rescuing capability is IF isotype-specific and not restricted to SMA-5 mutants but extends to other regulators of IF network morphogenesis, i.e. the cytoskeletal linker IFO-1 and the IF-associated protein BBLN1. The findings provide strong evidence for a gain-of-toxic function of the deranged IF networks with implications for diseases that are characterized by altered IF network organization.",

    "abstract": "Given their ancient evolutionary origins, eukaryotic mitochondria possess multiple vestiges of their prokaryotic ancestors. One such factor is the N-terminal formylation of proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA. N-formylated proteins are also released by bacteria and trigger activation of immune cells such as neutrophils. Growing evidence indicate that circulating levels of mitochondrial formyl proteins are elevated in the serum of patients with excessive inflammatory responses and trigger neutrophil activation like their bacterial counterparts. However, the cellular source of these proteins, and the mechanism by which they are released into the circulation is not known. In this study, we have identified vascular endothelial cells as a source of mitophagy induced release of formyl proteins in response to inflammatory mediators in vitro. Mechanistically, endothelial mitophagy required activation of the Pink1 pathway. Using liposomal delivery of sgRNA targeting Pink1 in mice expressing endothelial-specific Cas9, we developed a mouse model in which Pink1 is specifically depleted in the endothelium. Deletion of endothelial Pink1 was remarkably protective in endotoxin-induced lung inflammation, resulting in reduced neutrophil infiltration and significantly reduced death in mice. We thus propose that endothelial cells upregulate pro-inflammatory mitophagy in response to inflammation, leading to release of mitochondrial formyl peptides and detrimental neutrophil recruitment into the lung.",

Cell expansion \"with\" or \"without\" cell proliferation were implemented using different simple algorithms, as \"additive growth\" and \"expansive growth\", respectively. When the different types of growth algorithm with a biased restriction were calculated, the additive growth maintained a relative shape corresponding to the gradients with different lengths. However, diverse shapes were generated by the gradients in the cases of expansive growth and its combinations even with negate effects by additive growth. As an operative example of this attempt, leaf shapes with smooth margins were calculated using a combination of these growth algorithms.\n\nFinally, we concluded that different algorithms brought different responses against the simple positional information, i.e., additive growth always governed by it or expansive growth can escape it. It was predicted theoretically that an expansive growth has a capacity to become a generator of diversity at least in leaf morphogenesis.\n\nSummary statementExplanation of different responses against single positional information by different algorithms for two types of growth modes.",

    "abstract": "Gonadal sex differentiation among vertebrates involves divergent fates of a common groups of progenitor cells present in both presumptive ovaries and testes. The first cell type to differentiate gives rise to pre-Sertoli cells in the testis, and pre-follicular cells in the ovary. These cells derive form a common lineage of so-called \"supporting cells\". In birds and other egg-laying vertebrates, locally synthesised estrogen has a central role in ovarian development and influence the fate of these supporting cells. Manipulation of estrogen levels during embryonic development induces gonadal sex reversal, providing an experimental setting to evaluate the process of gonadal sex differentiation. Recently, we identified PAX2 as a novel marker of the undifferentiated supporting cell lineage in the chicken embryo, expressed in both sexes prior to overt gonadal sex differentiation. PAX2 expression is downregulated at the onset of gonadal sex differentiation in both males and females. The analysis of this undifferentiated supporting cell marker, together with Sertoli (male) and pre-granulosa (female) will enhance our understanding of supporting cell differentiation. Here we characterized the supporting cells differentiation process and identified undifferentiated supporting cells in estrogen-mediated sex reversal experiments. Female embryos treated with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole developed ovotestis, containing pre-granulosa cells, Sertoli cells and PAX2 positive undifferentiated supporting cells. In contrast, male embryos treated with 17{beta}-estradiol showed no PAX2+ undifferentiated gonadal supporting cells. Fadrozole time-course as well as multiple dose analysis suggests that supporting cell transdifferentiation involves a dedifferentiation event into a PAX2+ undifferentiated supporting cell state, followed by a redifferentiation towards the opposite sex lineage.",

    "abstract": "The temporary exposure of single-stranded regions in the genome during the process of replication and transcription makes the region vulnerable to cytosine deamination resulting higher rate of C[-&gt;]T transitions. Intra-operon intergenic regions undergo transcription along with adjacent co-transcribed genes in an operon, whereas inter-operon intergenic regions only undergo replication. Hence these two types of intergenic regions (IGRs) can be compared to find out the contribution of replication-associated mutations (RAM) and transcription-associated mutations (TrAM) towards bringing variation in genomes. In our work, we performed a polymorphism spectra comparison between intra-operon IGRs and inter-operon IGRs in genomes of two well-known closely related bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. In general, the size of intra-operon IGRs was smaller than that of inter-operon IGRs in these bacteria. Interestingly, the polymorphism frequency at intra-operon IGRs was 2.5-fold lesser than that in the inter-operon IGRs in E. coli genome. Similarly, the polymorphism frequency at intra-operon IGRs was 2.8-fold lesser than that in the inter-operon IGRs in S. enterica genome. Therefore, the intra-operon IGRs were often observed to be more conserved. In the case of inter-operon IGRs, the T[-&gt;]C transition frequency was a minimum of two times more than T[-&gt;]A transversion frequency whereas in the case of intra-operon IGRs, T[-&gt;]C transition frequency was similar to that of T[-&gt;]A transversion frequency. The polymorphism was purine biased and keto biased more in intra-operon IGRs than the inter-operon IGRs. In E. coli, the Ti/Tv ratio was observed as 1.639 and 1.338 in inter-operon and in intra-operon IGRs, respectively. In S. enterica, the Ti/Tv ratio was observed as 2.134 and 2.780 in inter-operon and in intra-operon IGRs, respectively. The observation in this study indicates that transcribed IGRs might not always have higher polymorphism frequency than the untranscribed IGRs. The lower polymorphism frequency at intra-operon IGRs might be attributed to different events such as the transcription-coupled DNA repair, sequences facilitating translation initiation and avoidance of rho-dependent transcription termination.",

For social, economic, and infrastructural systems, they succeeded in modeling the dynamics of ranking with two mechanisms, namely displacement (i.e., shuffling of ranks among existing elements) and replacement of elements by new elements. A general pattern is that, for open systems with influx and outflux of elements, e.g., a list with a subset of elements, only the top of the list is stable; for closed systems, top and bottom are stable. This model was fitted to empirical data, resulting in a universal curve in which displacement and replacement parameters are inversely related, which implies that a single parameter could regulate both. Our aim is twofold: First, we demonstrate that the pattern generalizes to ranking of biological species, based on FishBase records of fish taxonomy and life history traits. Second, we propose a candidate for a unified mechanism, based on a recent model of the thermodynamics of self-replication.",

This is the case of BTN clones affecting the common cockle, Cerastoderma edule, which inhabits the Atlantic coasts of Europe and north-west Africa. To investigate the origin and evolution of contagious cancers in common cockles, we collected 6,854 C. edule specimens and diagnosed 390 cases of BTN. We then generated a reference genome for the species and assessed genomic variation in the genomes of 61 BTN tumours. Analysis of tumour-specific variants confirmed the existence of two cockle BTN lineages with independent clonal origins, and gene expression patterns supported their status as haemocyte-derived marine leukaemias. Examination of mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed several mitochondrial capture events in BTN, as well as co-infection of cockles by different tumour lineages. Mutational analyses identified two lineage-specific mutational signatures, one of which resembles a signature associated with DNA alkylation. Karyotypic and copy number analyses uncovered genomes marked by pervasive instability and polyploidy. Whole-genome duplication, amplification of oncogenes CCND3 and MDM2, and deletion of the DNA alkylation repair gene MGMT, are likely drivers of BTN evolution. Characterization of satellite DNA identified elements with vast expansions in the cockle germ line, yet absent from BTN tumours, suggesting ancient clonal origins. Our study illuminates the evolution of contagious cancers under the sea, and reveals long-term tolerance of extreme instability in neoplastic genomes.",

    "abstract": "Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are an emerging model organism for primate biology, behavior, health, and conservation. Although little has been known about their cellular and molecular biology, in the accompanying paper we used large-scale single cell RNA-sequencing of 27 organs and tissues to identify over 750 molecular cell types and their full transcriptomic profiles. Here we use this extensive transcriptomic dataset to uncover thousands of previously unidentified genes and hundreds of thousands of new splice junctions in the reference genome that globally define lemur gene structures and cell-type selective expression and splicing and to investigate gene expression evolution. We use the atlas to explore the biology and function of the lemur immune system, including the expression profiles across the organism of all MHC genes and chemokines in health and disease, and the mapping of neutrophil and macrophage development, trafficking, and activation, their local and global responses to infection, and primate-specific aspects of the program. We characterize other examples of primate-specific physiology and disease such as unique features of lemur adipocytes that may underlie their dramatic seasonal rhythms, and spontaneous metastatic endometrial cancer that models the human gynecological malignancy. We identify and describe the organism-wide expression profiles of over 400 primate genes missing in mice, some implicated in human disease. Thus, an organism-wide molecular cell atlas and molecular cell autopsies can enhance gene discovery, structure definition, and annotation in a new model organism, and can identify and elucidate primate-specific genes, physiology, diseases, and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Inbred mouse strains reveal the molecular basis of mammalian traits and diseases, particularly recessive ones. We utilized mouse community curated resources to set up an automated screen to discover novel testable gene function hypotheses. Using 11,832 community contributed strain-differentiating experiments and trait presence/absence scoring, we searched for all experiments where strains can be split by their phenotypic values (e.g., high vs. low responders). Then, using 48 sequenced strains, we found one or more candidate gene for each experiment where homozygous high-impact variants (such as stopgain, frameshifts) segregate strains into these same binary grouping. Our approach rediscovered 212 known gene-phenotype relationships, almost always highlighting potentially novel causal variants, as well as thousands of gene function hypotheses. To help find the most exciting hypotheses, we improved the state of the art in machine learning driven literature-based discovery (LBD). Reading on our top 3 ranked candidate genes per experiment reveals 80% of rediscovered relationships, compared to 5% reading at random. We proposed 1,842 novel gene-phenotype testable hypotheses using our approach. We built a web portal at aimhigh.stanford.edu to allow researchers to view all our testable hypotheses in detail. Our open-source code can be rerun as more sequenced strains and phenotyping experiments become available.",

    "abstract": "The application of nanopores as label-free, single-molecule biosensors for electrical or optical probing of structural features in biomolecules has been widely explored. While biological nanopores (membrane proteins and bacteriophage portal proteins) and solid-state nanopores (thin films and two-dimensional materials) have been extensively employed, the third class of nanopores known as hybrid nanopores, where an artificial membrane substitutes the organic support membrane of proteins, has been only sparsely studied, due to challenges in implementation. G20c portal protein contains a natural DNA pore that is used by viruses for filling their capsid with viral genomic DNA. We have previously developed a lipid-free hybrid nanopore by \"corking\" the G20c portal protein into a SiNx nanopore. Herein, we demonstrate that through chemical functionalization of the synthetic nanopore, covalent linkage between the solid-state pore and the G20c portal protein considerably improves the hybrid pore stability, lifetime, and voltage resilience. Moreover, we demonstrate electric-field-driven and motor protein-mediated transport of DNA molecules through this hybrid pore. Our integrated protein/solid-state hybrid nanopore can serve as a robust and durable framework for sensing and sequencing at high voltages, potentially providing higher resolution, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and higher throughput compared to the more conventional membrane-embedded protein platforms.",

    "abstract": "TP73, a member of the p53 family, is expressed as TAp73 and {Delta}Np73 along with multiple C-terminal isoforms (-{eta}). {Delta}Np73 is primarily expressed in neuronal cells and necessary for neuronal development. Interestingly, while TAp73 is a tumor suppressor and predominantly expressed in normal cells, TAp73 is found to be frequently altered in human cancers, suggesting a role of TAp73 C-terminal isoforms in tumorigenesis. To test this, the TCGA SpliceSeq database was searched and showed that exon 11 (E11) exclusion occurs frequently in several human cancers. We also found that p73 to p73{gamma} isoform switch resulting from E11 skipping occurs frequently in human prostate cancers and dog lymphomas. To determine whether p73 to p73{gamma} isoform switch plays a role in tumorigenesis, CRISPR technology was used to generate multiple cancer cell lines and a mouse model in that Trp73 E11 is deleted. Surprisingly, we found that in E11-deificient cells, p73{gamma} becomes the predominant isoform and exerts oncogenic activities by promoting cell proliferation and migration. In line with this, E11-deficient mice were more prone to obesity and B-cell lymphomas, indicating a unique role of p73{gamma} in lipid metabolism and tumorigenesis. Additionally, we found that E11-deficient mice phenocopies Trp73-deficient mice with short lifespan, infertility, and chronic inflammation. Mechanistically, Mechanistically, we showed that Leptin, a pleiotropic adipocytokine involved in energy metabolism and oncogenesis, was highly induced by p73{gamma}, necessary for p73{gamma}-mediated oncogenic activity, and associated with p73 to {gamma} isoform switch in human prostate cancer and dog lymphoma. Finally, we showed that E11-knockout promoted, whereas knockdown of p73{gamma} or Leptin suppressed, xenograft growth in mice. Our study indicates that the p73{gamma}-Leptin pathway promotes tumorigenesis and alters lipid metabolism, which may be targeted for cancer management.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring microbial communities often comprise thousands of taxa involved in complex networks of interactions. These interactions can be mediated by several mechanisms, including the competition for resources, the exchange of signals and nutrients, cell-cell contact and antibiotic warfare. In addition to direct measurements and computational predictions of interactions, abundant data on microbial co-occurrence associations can be inferred from correlations of taxa across samples, which can be estimated from metagenomic, and amplicon datasets. The analysis and interpretation of interaction and correlation networks are limited by the challenge of comparing across different datasets, due to heterogeneity of the data itself and to the lack of a platform to facilitate such comparisons. Here, we introduce the Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND) - a web-based platform for the integrative analysis of different types of microbial networks, freely available at http://microbialnet.org/. In addition to containing a growing body of curated data, including amplicon-based co-occurrence networks, genome-scale model-derived networks, metabolic influence networks and horizontal gene transfer networks, MIND allows users to upload and analyze newly generated networks using a JSON format and standard NCBI taxonomy. The platform provides convenient functions to compare and query multiple networks simultaneously, and to visualize and export networks and datasets. Through some illustrative examples, we demonstrate how the platform might facilitate discoveries and help generate new hypotheses on host-associated and environmentally important microbial ecosystems through the power of knowledge integration.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques such as deep learning have been increasingly used to assist EEG annotation, by automating artifact recognition, sleep staging, and seizure detection. In lack of automation, the annotation process is prone to bias, even for trained annotators. On the other hand, completely automated processes do not offer the users the opportunity to inspect the models output and re-evaluate potential false predictions. As a first step towards addressing these challenges, we developed Robins Viewer (RV), a Python-based EEG viewer for annotating time-series EEG data. The key feature distinguishing RV from existing EEG viewers is the visualization of output predictions of deep-learning models trained to recognize patterns in EEG data. RV was developed on top of the plotting library Plotly, the app-building framework Dash, and the popular M/EEG analysis toolbox MNE. It is an open-source, platform-independent, interactive web application, which supports common EEG-file formats to facilitate easy integration with other EEG toolboxes. RV includes common features of other EEG viewers, e.g., a view-slider, tools for marking bad channels and transient artifacts, and customizable preprocessing. Altogether, RV is an EEG viewer that combines the predictive power of deep-learning models and the knowledge of scientists and clinicians to optimize EEG annotation. With the training of new deep-learning models, RV could be developed to detect clinical patterns other than artifacts, for example sleep stages and EEG abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Francisella tularensis, the bacterium that causes the zoonosis tularemia, and its genetic near neighbor species, can be difficult or impossible to cultivate from complex samples. Thus, there is a lack of genomic information for these species that has, among other things, limited the development of robust detection assays for F. tularensis that are both specific and sensitive. The objective of this study was to develop and validate approaches to capture, enrich, sequence, and analyze Francisella DNA present in DNA extracts generated from complex samples. RNA capture probes were designed based upon the known pan genome of F. tularensis and other diverse species in the family Francisellaceae. Probes that targeted genomic regions also present in non-Francisellaceae species were excluded, and probes specific to particular Francisella species or phylogenetic clades were identified. The capture-enrichment system was then applied to diverse, complex DNA extracts containing low-level Francisella DNA, including human clinical tularemia samples, environmental samples (i.e., animal tissue and air filters), and whole ticks/tick cell lines, which was followed by sequencing of the enriched samples. Analysis of the resulting data facilitated rigorous and unambiguous confirmation of the detection of F. tularensis or other Francisella species in complex samples, identification of mixtures of different Francisella species in the same sample, analysis of gene content (e.g., known virulence and antimicrobial resistance loci), and high-resolution whole genome-based genotyping. The benefits of this capture-enrichment system include: even very low target DNA can be amplified; it is culture-independent, reducing exposure for research and/or clinical personnel and allowing genomic information to be obtained from samples that do not yield isolates; and the resulting comprehensive data not only provide robust means to confirm the presence of a target species in a sample, but also can provide data useful for source attribution, which is important from a genomic epidemiology perspective.",
