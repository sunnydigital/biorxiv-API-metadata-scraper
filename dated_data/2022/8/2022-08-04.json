    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to further improve an in vitro 3D osteoblast (OB) - osteoclast (OC) co-culture model of bone by tuning it towards states of formation, resorption, and equilibrium for their future applications in fundamental research, drug development and personalized medicine. This was achieved by varying culture medium composition and monocyte seeding density, the two external parameters that affect cell behavior the most. Monocytes were seeded at two seeding densities onto 3D silk-fibroin constructs pre-mineralized by MSC-derived OBs and were co-cultured in one of three different media (OC stimulating, Neutral and OB stimulating medium) for three weeks. Histology showed mineralized matrix after co-culture and OC markers in the OC medium group. Scanning Electron Microscopy showed large OC-like cells in the OC medium group. Micro-computed tomography showed increased formation in the OB medium group, equilibrium in the Neutral medium group and resorption in the OC medium group. Culture supernatant samples showed high early TRAP release in the OC medium group, a later and lower release in the Neutral medium group, and almost no release in the OB medium group. Increased monocyte seeding density showed a less-than-proportional increase in TRAP release and resorption in OC medium, while it proportionally increased TRAP release in Neutral medium without affecting net resorption. The 3D OB-OC co-culture model was effectively used to show an excess of mineral deposition using OB medium, resorption using OC medium, or an equilibrium using Neutral medium. All three media applied to the model may have their own distinct applications in fundamental research, drug development, and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Auditory learning depends on sensory, perceptual, decisional, and reward-based processes that are supported by the dorsal striatum. Auditory corticostriatal connections have been well-characterized in animal models including non-human primates, where primary auditory cortex preferentially connects to putamen, and caudate head receives most of its inputs from anterior superior temporal cortex. However, the extent to which human auditory corticostriatal connectivity follows similar organizational principles is challenging to assess due to the density of these striatal structures relative to the resolution of traditional diffusion MRI techniques, as well as dorsal striatums location near multiple major crossing white matter bundles. We leveraged high-quality diffusion-weighted MRI tractography to  virtually dissect structural pathways between auditory cortical regions and dorsal striatal regions in a sub-millimeter resolution single-participant dataset. Across most of auditory cortex, putamen connections were more frequent than caudate connections; only anterior-most superior temporal cortex had strong connectivity with caudate, specifically the caudate head. Putamen streamline endpoints were largely along the ventral portion of the structure, ranging from caudal to middle putamen. These results were consistent across analysis and tractography pipelines. In contrast to the auditory findings, visual corticostriatal streamlines did not preferentially reach putamen. We replicate these results in an independent sample of near-millimeter resolution single-session diffusion MRI from the Human Connectome Project. Overall, our results suggest strong structural connectivity between primary and association auditory cortices with putamen but not with any subdivision of caudate. Prioritized connectivity between superior temporal cortex and putamen is highly suggestive of distinct functional roles for striatal subdivisions in auditory perception.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that recovery of visual responses to a deprived eye during the critical period in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) requires both export of mRNA encoding brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to the dendrites of cortical cells (Kaneko et al., 2012) and phosphorylation of the TrkB receptor for BDNF (Kaneko et al., 2008a). TrkB phosphorylation is not required for the loss of response during monocular deprivation (MD). Studies in vitro show that formation of new connections requires BDNF (Meyer-Franke et al., 1995, 1998; Gottmann et al., 2009). We have now studied the temporal relationship between the production of mature BDNF and the recovery of visual responses. Visual cortical responses to an eye whose vision has been occluded for several days during the critical period and is then re-opened recovers rapidly during binocular vision or more slowly following reverse occlusion, when the previously intact fellow eye is occluded in a model of \"patch therapy\" for amblyopia. The time to recovery of visual responses differed by 18 hours between these two procedures, but in each the production of mature BDNF preceded the recovery by 6 hours. These findings suggest that a spurt of BDNF secretion stimulates the growth of connections serving the deprived eye to restore visual responses.\n\nSignificance StatementBy demonstrating that BDNF production precedes rather than merely accompanies the increase in cortical responses, we provide further evidence that BDNF production plays a causal role, thereby gating the plasticity that underlies the recovery of visual cortex from monocular deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive functions arise from the coordinated activity of neural populations distributed over large-scale brain networks. However, it is challenging to understand and measure how specific aspects of neural dynamics translate into operations of information processing, and, ultimately, cognitive functions. An obstacle is that simple circuit mechanisms-such as self-sustained or propagating activity and nonlinear summation of inputs-do not directly give rise to high-level functions. Nevertheless, they already implement simple transformations of the information carried by neural activity.\n\nHere, we propose that distinct neural circuit functions, such as stimulus representation, working memory, or selective attention stem from different combinations and types of low-level manipulations of information, or information processing primitives. To test this hypothesis, we combine approaches from information theory with computational simulations of canonical neural circuits involving one or more interacting brain regions that emulate well-defined cognitive functions. More specifically, we track the dynamics of information emergent from dynamic patterns of neural activity, using suitable quantitative metrics to detect where and when information is actively buffered (\"active information storage\"), transferred (\"information transfer\") or non-linearly merged (\"information modification\"), as possible modes of low-level processing. We find that neuronal subsets maintaining representations in working memory or performing attention-related gain modulation are signaled by their boosted involvement in operations of active information storage or information modification, respectively.\n\nThus, information dynamics metrics, beyond detecting which network units participate in cognitive processing, also promise to specify how and when they do it, i.e., through which type of primitive computation, a capability that may be exploited for the parsing of actual experimental recordings.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative pathogen, living in constant competition with other bacteria in both marine environments and during human infection. One competitive advantage of V. cholerae is the ability to metabolize diverse carbon sources such as chitin and citrate. We observed that when V. cholerae strains were grown on a medium with citrate, the mediums chemical composition turned into a hostile alkaline environment for Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri. We found that although the ability to exclude competing bacteria was not contingent on exogenous citrate, V. cholerae citrate metabolism mutants {Delta}oadA-1, {Delta}citE, and {Delta}citF mutants were not able to inhibit S. flexneri or E. coli growth. Lastly, we demonstrated that while the V. cholerae mediated increased medium pH was necessary for the enteric exclusion phenotype, secondary metabolites such as bicarbonate (protonated to carbonate in the raised pH) from the metabolism of citrate enhanced the ability to inhibit the growth of E. coli. These data provide a novel example of how V. cholerae outcompetes other Gram-negative bacteria.",

The underlying transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) is responsible for altering the physiological state of the bacterium to adapt to each host environment. Consequently, an in-depth understanding the comprehensive dynamics of its TRN could inform new therapeutic strategies. Here, we compiled 116 existing high-quality RNA-seq data sets of S. pyogenes serotype M1, and estimated the TRN structure in a top-down fashion by performing independent component analysis (ICA). The algorithm computed 42 independently modulated sets of genes (iModulons). Four iModulons contained nga-ifs-slo virulence-related operon, which allowed us to identify carbon sources that control its expression. In particular, dextrin utilization upregulated nga-ifs-slo operon by activation of two-component regulatory system CovRS-related iModulons, and changed bacterial hemolytic activity compared to glucose or maltose utilization. Finally, we show that the iModulon-based TRN structure can be used to simplify interpretation of noisy bacterial transcriptome at the infection site.",

They have been reported to interact with each other, and although they have been the subject of considerable research interest, not much is known about the molecular basis for their biological activity. Although they show great variability in taxonomic occurrence, phenotypic profile, and molecular properties, we find that they nevertheless share a conserved N-terminal sequence motif, which points to a common evolutionary origin. The motif always occurs N-terminally to a coiled-coil helix that mediates dimerization. We define the motif and coiled coil jointly as a new domain, which we name DivIVA-like. In a large-scale survey of this domain in the protein sequence database, we identify a new family of proteins potentially involved in cell division, whose members, unlike all other DivIVA-like proteins, have between 2 and 8 copies of the domain in tandem. AlphaFold models indicate that the domains in these proteins assemble within a single chain, therefore not mediating dimerization.",

    "abstract": "Through their metabolism, heterotrophic microbes drive carbon cycling in many environments (1). These microbes consume (and produce) hundreds to thousands of different metabolic substrates, begging the question of what level of description is required to understand the metabolic processes structuring their communities: do we need to account for the detailed metabolic capabilities of each organism, or can these capabilities be understood in terms of a few well-conserved carbon utilization strategies that could be more easily interpreted and more robustly predicted? Based on the high-throughput phenotyping of a diverse collection of marine bacteria, we showed that the fundamental metabolic strategy of heterotrophic microbes can be understood in terms of a single axis of variation, representing their preference for either glycolytic (sugars) or gluconeogenic (amino and organic acids) carbon sources. Moreover, an organisms position on this axis is imprinted in its genome, allowing us to successfully predict metabolic strategy across the bacterial tree of life. Our analysis also unveils a novel and general association between metabolic strategy and genomic GC content, which we hypothesize results from the difference in C:N supply associated with typical sugar and acid substrates. Thus, our work reveals a fundamental constraint on microbial evolution that structures bacterial genomes and communities and can be leveraged to understand diversity in functional terms, beyond catalogs of genes and taxa.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic fluctuations in gene expression emanating from HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), amplified by the Tat positive feedback circuit, determine the choice between viral infection fates: active transcription (ON) or transcriptional silence (OFF). The emergence of several transcription factor binding site (TFBS) variant strains in HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C), especially those containing the duplication of NF-{kappa}B motif, mandates the evaluation of the effect of enhanced transcriptional strength on gene expression noise and its influence on viral fate-selection switch. Using a panel of subgenomic LTR-variant strains containing varying copy numbers of the NF-{kappa}B motif (ranging from 0 to 4), we employed flow cytometry, mRNA quantification, and pharmacological perturbations to demonstrate an inverse correlation between promoter strength and gene expression noise in Jurkat T-cells and primary CD4+ T-cells. The inverse correlation is consistent in clonal cell populations, at constant intracellular concentrations of Tat, and when NF-{kappa}B levels were regulated pharmacologically. Further, we show that strong LTRs containing at least two copies of the NF-{kappa}B motif in the enhancer establish a stabler latent state and demonstrate rapid latency reversal than weak LTRs containing fewer motifs. An engineered LTR containing three copies of the C-{kappa}B motif (CCC), an element unique for HIV-1C, demonstrated significantly higher levels of gene expression noise compared to the canonical HHC-LTR or two other engineered LTRs containing three copies of the H-{kappa}B (HHH) or F-{kappa}B (FFF) motif. This result suggests the indispensable nature of the C-{kappa}B motif for HIV-1C despite higher-level gene expression noise. We also demonstrate a cooperative binding of NF-{kappa}B to the motif cluster in HIV-1C LTRs containing two, three, or four NF-{kappa}B motifs (H = 2.61, 3.56, and 3.75, respectively). The present work alludes to a possible evolution of HIV-1C LTR towards gaining transcriptional strength associated with attenuated gene expression noise with implications for viral latency.\n\nAuthor SummaryOver the past two consecutive decades, HIV-1C has been undergoing directional evolution towards augmenting the transcriptional strength of the LTR by adding more copies of the existing TFBS by sequence duplication. Additionally, the duplicated elements are genetically diverse, suggesting broader-range signal receptivity by variant LTRs. HIV-1 promoter is inherently noisy, and the stochastic fluctuations in gene expression of variant LTRs may influence the ON/OFF latency decisions. The evolving NF-{kappa}B motif variations of HIV-1C offer a powerful opportunity to examine how the transcriptional strength of the LTR might influence gene expression noise. Our work here shows that the augmented transcriptional strength of HIV-1C LTR leads to a concomitantly reduced gene expression noise, consequently leading to stabler latency maintenance and rapid latency reversal. The present work offers a novel lead towards appreciating the molecular mechanisms governing HIV-1 latency.",

    "abstract": "A common strategy used by bacteria to resist antibiotics is enzymatic degradation or modification. Such a collective mechanism also enhances the survival of nearby cells, an effect that increases with the number of bacteria that are present. Collective resistance is of clinical significance, yet a quantitative understanding at the population level is lacking. Here we develop a general theoretical framework of collective resistance under antibiotic degradation. Our modeling reveals that population survival crucially depends on the ratio of timescales of two processes: the rates of population death and antibiotic removal. However, it is insensitive to molecular, biological and kinetic details of the underlying processes that give rise to these timescales. Another important aspect for this  race to survival is the degree of  cooperativity, which is related to the permeability of the cell wall for antibiotics and enzymes. These observations motivate a coarse-grained, phenomenological model and simple experimental assay to measure the dose-dependent minimal surviving population size. From this model, two dimensionless parameters can be estimated, representing the populations race to survival and single-cell resistance. Our simple model may serve as reference for more complex situations, such as heterogeneous bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is an ecologically generalist bacterium but also an opportunistic pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired infections and a major contributor to the global burden of antimicrobial resistance. In the last decades, few advances have been made in the use of virulent phages as alternative or complement to antibiotics to treat Kp infections. The efficiency of phages relies on their ability to recognize and attach to the bacterial surface structure, and in the case of Kp, capsule (K) is the main surface structure. However, Kp capsule is highly polymorphic and the majority of classically isolated phages are specific for unique K-types, limiting therapy prospects. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative strategy consisting in isolating phages that target capsule-deficient mutant Kp strains, and compare such phages with anti-capsulated cells phages phylogenetically and through in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n\nMethodsWe isolated 27 phages using 7 capsule-deficient Kp strains as hosts (anti-Kd phages), and 41 phages against 7 wild-type (wt) Kp strains (anti-K phages). We evaluated and compared phenotypically and genotypically their host range, resistance emergence and selected mutations and in-vivo activity.\n\nResultsIn vitro, anti-Kd phages showed a broader host-range, with most phages being able to infect non-capsulated mutants of multiple sublineages and O-antigen locus types. Besides, the emergence of bacterial subpopulations non-susceptible to anti-Kd phages was slower when compared to anti-K phages and with a different range of genomic differences. One anti-Kd phage (mtp5) was shown to infect non-capsulated Kp strains belonging to 10 of the 12 known O-antigen types. Moreover, this phage was able to replicate in the gut of mice colonised with the wt (capsulated) parent strain.\n\nConclusionsThis work demonstrates the potential value of an anti-Klebsiella phage isolation strategy that addresses the issue of narrow host-range of anti-K phages. Anti Kd-phages may be active in infection sites where capsule expression is intermittent or repressed, or in combination with anti-K phages, which often induce loss of capsule escape mutants.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of toxic arsenate (AsV) in the environment has virtually raised mechanisms of resistance in all living organisms. Generally, bacterial detoxification of AsV relies on its reduction to arsenite (AsIII) by ArsC, followed by the export of AsIII by ArsB. However, how pathogenic species resist this metalloid remains largely unknown. Here, we found that V. cholerae, the etiologic agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, outcompetes other enteropathogens when grown on millimolar concentrations of AsV. To do so, V. cholerae uses, instead of ArsCB, the AsV-inducible vc1068-1071 operon (renamed var for vibrio arsenate resistance), which encodes the arsenate repressor ArsR, an alternative glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a putative phosphatase, and the AsV transporter ArsJ. In addition to Var, V. cholerae induces oxidative stress- related systems to counter ROS production caused by intracellular AsV. Characterization of the var mutants suggested these proteins function independently from one another and play critical roles in preventing deleterious effects on the cell membrane potential and growth derived from the accumulation AsV. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that V. cholerae complexes AsV with the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate into 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate (1As3PG). We further show that 1As3PG is not transported outside the cell; instead, it is subsequently dissociated to enable extrusion of free AsV through ArsJ. Collectively, we propose the formation of 1As3PG as a transient metabolic storage of AsV to curb the noxious effect of free AsV. This study advances our understanding of AsV resistance in bacteria and underscores new points of vulnerability that might be an attractive target for antimicrobial interventions.",

    "abstract": "A critical step in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biogenesis involves flipping lipooligosaccharide, an LPS precursor, from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic leaflet of the inner membrane, an operation carried out by the ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA. Although MsbA has been extensively studied, the selectivity of MsbA-lipid interactions remains poorly understood. Here we use native mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize MsbA-lipid interactions and guide structural studies. We show the transporter co-purifies with copper(II) and metal binding modulates protein-lipid interactions. A 2.15 [A] resolution structure of an N-terminal region of MsbA in complex with copper(II) is presented, revealing a structure reminiscent of the GHK peptide, a high-affinity copper(II) chelator. Our results demonstrate conformation-dependent lipid binding affinities, particularly for the LPS-precursor, 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo)2-lipid A (KLA). We report a 3.6 [A]-resolution structure of MsbA trapped in an open, outward-facing conformation with adenosine 5-diphosphate and vanadate, revealing an unprecedented KLA binding site, wherein the lipid forms extensive interactions with the transporter. Additional studies provide evidence that the exterior KLA binding site is conserved and a positive allosteric modulator of ATPase activity, serving as a feedforward activation mechanism to couple transporter activity with LPS biosynthesis.",
