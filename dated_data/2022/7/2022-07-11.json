    "abstract": "Karyotype refers to the configuration of the genome into a set of chromosomes. The karyotype difference between species is expected to impede various biological processes, such as chromosome segregation or meiotic chromosome pairing, potentially contributing to incompatibility. Karyotypes can rapidly change between closely related species and even among populations of the same species. However, the forces driving karyotype evolution are poorly understood. Here we describe a unique karyotype of a D. melanogaster strain isolated from the Seychelles archipelago. This strain has lost the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus on the X chromosome. Because the Y chromosome is the only other rDNA-bearing chromosome, all females carry at least one Y chromosome as the source of rDNA. Interestingly, we found that the strain also carries a truncated Y chromosome (YS) that is stably maintained in the population despite its inability to support male fertility. Our modeling and cytological analysis suggest that the Y chromosome has a larger negative impact on female fitness than the YS chromosome. Moreover, we generated an independent strain that lacks X rDNA and has a karyotype of XXY females and XY males. This strain quickly evolved multiple karyotypes: two new truncated Y chromosomes (similar to YS), as well as two independent X chromosome fusions that contain the Y-derived rDNA fragment, eliminating females dependence on the Y chromosome. Considering that Robertsonian fusions frequently occur at rDNA loci in humans, we propose that rDNA loci instability is a driving force of karyotype evolution.",

    "abstract": "Deep language models (DLMs) provide a novel computational paradigm for how the brain processes natural language. Unlike symbolic, rule-based models described in psycholinguistics, DLMs encode words and their context as continuous numerical vectors. These \"embeddings\" are constructed by a sequence of computations organized in \"layers\" to ultimately capture surprisingly sophisticated representations of linguistic structures. How does this layered hierarchy map onto the human brain during natural language comprehension? In this study, we used electrocorticography (ECoG) to record neural activity in language areas along the superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus while human participants listened to a 30-minute spoken narrative. We supplied this same narrative to a high-performing DLM (GPT2-XL) and extracted the contextual embeddings for each word in the story across all 48 layers of the model. We next trained a set of linear encoding models to predict the temporally-evolving neural activity from the embeddings at each layer. We found a striking correspondence between the layer-by-layer sequence of embeddings from GPT2-XL and the temporal sequence of neural activity in language areas. In addition, we found evidence for the gradual accumulation of recurrent information along the linguistic processing hierarchy. However, we also noticed additional neural processes in the brain, but not in DLMs, during the processing of surprising (unpredictable) words. These findings point to a connection between human language processing and DLMs where the layer-by-layer accumulation of contextual information in DLM embeddings matches the temporal dynamics of neural activity in high-order language areas.",

    "abstract": "Studies about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in different backgrounds such as naive populations, are still scarce, especially from South America. The aim of this work was to study the introduction and diversification pattern of SARS-CoV-2 during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northwestern Argentina (NWA) region and to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of the main lineages found. In this study, we analyzed a total of 260 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from Argentina, belonging to the Provinces of Jujuy, Salta and Tucuman, from March 31st, 2020, to May 22nd, 2021, which covered the full first wave and the early second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. In the first wave, eight lineages were identified: B.1.499 (76.9%), followed by N.5 (10.2%), B.1.1.274 (3.7%), B.1.1.348 (3.7%), B.1 (2.8%), B.1.600 (0.9%), B.1.1.33 (0.9%) and N.3 (0.9%). During the early second wave, the first-wave lineages were displaced by the introduction of variants of concern (VOC) (Alpha, Gamma), or variants of interest (VOI) (Lambda, Zeta, Epsilon) and other lineages with more limited distribution. Phylodynamic analyses of the B.1.499 and N.5, the two most prevalent lineages in NWA, revealed that the substitution rate of lineage N.5 (7.9 x 10-4 substitutions per site per year, s/s/y) was a [~]40% faster than that of lineage B.1.499 (5.9 x 10-4 s/s/y), although both are in the same order of magnitude than other non-VOC lineages. No mutations associated with a biological characteristic of importance were observed as signatures markers of the phylogenetic groups established in Northwestern Argentina, however, single sequences in non-VOC lineages did present mutations of biological importance or associated with VOCs as sporadic events, showing that many of these mutations could emerge from circulation in the general population. This study contributed to the knowledge about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a pre-vaccination and without post-exposure immunization period.",

Although the distribution of sequence identities was similar in COVID-19 and healthy repertoires, the COVID-19 hits were significantly more clonally expanded than healthy hits. Furthermore, among the tested hits, 17 out of 94 from COVID-19, compared with 2 out of 96 from healthy, bound to the enhancing epitope. A total of 6 of the 19 epitope-binding antibodies enhanced ACE2 receptor binding to the spike protein. Together, this study revealed that enhancing antibodies are far more frequent in COVID-19 patients than in healthy donors, but a reservoir of potential enhancing antibodies exists in healthy donors that could potentially mature to actual enhancing antibodies upon infection.",

We systematically compared five LAB strains for the effects of different carbohydrates on their free-living and biofilm lifestyles. We found that fermentable sugars triggered a heterogeneous response in LAB strains, frequently manifested specifically in altered carrying capacity during planktonic growth and colony development. The fermentation capacities of the strains were compatible and could not account for heterogeneity in their differential carrying capacity in liquid and on a solid medium. Among tested LAB strains, L. paracasei, and L. rhamanosus GG survived self-imposed acid stress while L. acidophilus was extremely sensitive to its own glucose utilization acidic products. The addition of a buffering system during growth on a solid medium significantly improved the survival of most tested probiotic strains during fermentation. We suggest that the optimal performance of the beneficial microbiota members belonging to lactobacilli is heterogeneous and varies as a function of the growth model and the dependency on a buffering system.",

    "abstract": "Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a Gram-negative oral bacterium associated with localized aggressive periodontitis as well as some systemic diseases. The strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans most closely associated with periodontal disease tend to produce more of a secreted leukotoxin (LtxA) than isolates from healthy carriers, suggesting a key role for this toxin in disease progression. LtxA is secreted via a type 1 secretion system, from the bacterial cytosol across both the inner and outer membranes in a single step into the supernatant, where it is able to interact with host cells. Upon secretion, some of the toxin associates with the bacterial cell membrane, enabling its release in association with the surface of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), small, spherical vesicles derived from the outer membrane. We have previously observed that the highly leukotoxic A. actinomycetemcomitans strain JP2 produces two populations of OMVs, a highly abundant population of small (<100 nm in diameter) OMVs, and a less abundant population of large (>300 nm in diameter) OMVs. Here, we have investigated the association of LtxA with the two populations of OMVs varying in size. Our results indicate that surface-associated DNA drives the selective sorting of LtxA to large OMVs.",

    "abstract": "The rate at which microorganisms grow and reproduce is fundamental to our understanding of microbial physiology and ecology. While soil microbiologists routinely quantify soil microbial biomass levels and the growth rates of individual taxa in culture, there is a limited understanding of how quickly microbes actually grow in soil. For this work, we posed the simple question: what are the growth rates of soil microorganisms? In this study, we measure these rates in three distinct soil environments using hydrogen stable isotope probing of lipids with 2H-enriched water. This technique provides a taxa-agnostic quantification of in situ microbial growth from the degree of 2H enrichment of intact polar lipid compounds ascribed to bacteria and fungi. We find that average apparent generation times in soil are quite slow (20 to 64 days) but also highly variable at the compound-specific level (6 to 1137 days), suggesting differential growth rates between community subsets. We observe that low-biomass communities can exhibit more rapid growth rates than high-biomass communities, highlighting that biomass quantity alone does not predict microbial productivity in soil. Furthermore, within a given soil, the rates at which specific lipids are being synthesized do not relate to their quantity, suggesting a general decoupling of microbial abundance and growth in soil microbiomes. More generally, we demonstrate the utility of lipid stable isotope probing for measuring microbial growth rates in soil and highlight the importance of measuring growth rates to complement more standard analyses of soil microbial communities.\n\nSignificanceGeneration times, how quickly organisms grow and reproduce, are a key feature of biology. However, there are few measurements of microbial generation times in soil, despite the crucial importance of soil microbes to terrestrial ecosystems. By measuring the rate at which isotopically labeled water is incorporated into microbial membranes, we find that the generation times of soil microorganisms are far longer than those typically observed in culture. Surprisingly, we observe that lower-biomass soils exhibited faster growth rates than high-biomass soils. More abundant microorganisms are not necessarily the fastest growing and most soil microorganisms are slow growers. Our results underscore the importance of considering slow and variable growth rates when studying microbial communities and their contributions to ecosystem processes.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), binds via ACE2 receptors, highly expressed in ciliated cells of the nasal epithelium. Micro-optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a minimally invasive intranasal imaging technique that can determine cellular and functional dynamics of respiratory epithelia at 1-m resolution, enabling real time visualization and quantification of epithelial anatomy, ciliary motion, and mucus transport. We hypothesized that respiratory epithelial cell dysfunction in COVID-19 will manifest as reduced ciliated cell function and mucociliary abnormalities, features readily visualized by OCT. Symptomatic outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 aged [&ge;] 18 years were recruited within 14 days of symptom onset. Data was interpreted for subjects with COVID-19 (n=13) in comparison to healthy controls (n=8). Significant reduction in functional cilia, diminished ciliary beat frequency, and abnormal ciliary activity were evident. Other abnormalities included denuded epithelium, presence of mucus rafts, and increased inflammatory cells. Our results indicate that subjects with mild but symptomatic COVID-19 exhibit functional abnormalities of the respiratory mucosa underscoring the importance of mucociliary health in viral illness and disease transmission. Ciliary imaging enables investigation of early pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 and may be useful for evaluating disease progression and therapeutic response.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499336v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f4bb17org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@271438org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a08762org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@184847_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Sequence divergence between repeats suppresses RMDs; the mechanisms of such suppression and of resolution of the mismatched bases remains poorly understood. We identified RMD regulators using a set of reporter assays in mouse cells that test two key parameters: repeat sequence divergence and the distances between one repeat and the initiating chromosomal double-strand break. We found that the mismatch repair factor MLH1 suppresses RMDs with sequence divergence in a manner that is epistatic with the mismatch repair factors MSH2 and MSH6, and which is dependent on residues in MLH1 and its binding partner PMS2 that are important for nuclease activity. Additionally, we found that resolution of mismatches in the RMD product have a specific polarity, where mismatched bases that are proximal to the chromosomal break end are preferentially removed. Moreover, we found that the MLH1 endonuclease domain is important for this polarity of mismatch resolution. Finally, we identified distinctions between MLH1 vs. TOP3 in regulation of RMDs. We suggest that MLH1 suppresses RMDs with sequence divergence, while also promoting directional mismatch resolution.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by infection with members of the Lyme borreliosis group of Borrelia spirochete bacteria, is increasing in frequency and distribution worldwide. This spread is driven by the expansion of ticks, vectors of these pathogens. Epigenetics may be involved in the interaction between mammalian host, tick, and bacterial pathogen, but is still poorly understood. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows the study of host response at the transcriptomic and methylomic scale.\n\nWe tested the effect of the Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 on a human primary cell line (HUVEC) and an immortalized cell line (HEK-293) for 72 h, a time consistent with the duration of tick feeding and host cell exposure to B. burgdorferi. RNA and DNA were extracted from cells and used for RNA-seq and Enzymatic-Methyl-seq (EM-seq). Differential expression and Reactome pathway enrichment analysis were performed. More significantly differentially expressed genes (a total of 69) were found in HUVECs compared to HEK-293 (a total of 8). Borrelia burgdorferi exposure significantly induced genes in the interferon, cytokine, and other immune response signaling in HUVECs. In HEK-293, pre-NOTCH processing in Golgi was identified as a significant pathway. Other significant genes suggest extracellular matrix binding and interaction in HEK-293. Data comparison with other transcriptomic studies of human cells exposed to B. burgdorferi revealed a small overlap in genes identified in HUVEC, but no overlap for HEK-293. No significant methylation changes were detected in HUVECs or HEK-293 exposed to B. burgdorferi. However, two long non-coding RNAs and a pseudogene were deregulated in response to B. burgdorferi in HUVEC suggesting that other epigenetic mechanisms may be initiated by infection.\n\nThis is the first study examining the transcriptome and methylome of human cells exposed to B. burgdorferi for 72 h and so contributes to the description of early-stage B. burgdorferi infection at the cellular level.",

    "abstract": "Some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) demonstrate biased signaling, where ligands of the same receptor differentially activate specific downstream signaling pathways over others. Ligand-specific receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases (GRKs) is one mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Recent evidence demonstrates that GPCRs traffic to and signal from subcellular compartments beyond the plasma membrane, a paradigm termed location bias. Here, we show that GRKs translocate to endosomes following stimulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and other GPCRs. The GRK recruitment patterns at the plasma membrane and endosome are distinct and depend on the identity of the ligand used to activate the receptor. Using cells deficient of GRKs, we demonstrate that biased ligands have unique signaling profiles upon rescue of location-specific GRK isoforms. Our work highlights a role of the GRKs in location-biased GPCR signaling and demonstrates the complex interactions between ligand, GRK isoform and cellular location that contribute to biased signaling.",

Previous studies in this endeavour have demonstrated template-directed replication using chemically modified nucleotides and primers. Nonetheless, similar studies that used non-activated nucleotides led to the formation of RNA only with abasic sites. In this study, we report template-directed replication with prebiotically relevant cyclic nucleotides, under dehydration-rehydration (DH-RH) cycles occurring at high temperature (90{degrees}C) and alkaline conditions (pH 8). 2'-3' cyclic nucleoside monophosphates (cNMP) resulted in primer extension, while 3'-5' cNMP failed to do so. Intact extension of up to two nucleotide additions was observed with both canonical hydroxy-terminated (OH-primer) and activated amino-terminated (NH2-primer) primers. We demonstrate primer extension reactions using both purine and pyrimidine 2'-3' cNMPs, with higher product yield observed during cAMP additions. Further, the presence of lipid was observed to significantly enhance the extended product in cCMP reactions. In all, our study provides a proof-of-concept for nonenzymatic replication of RNA, using intrinsically activated prebiotically relevant cyclic nucleotides as monomers.",

    "abstract": "NuA4, one of two major histone acetyltransferase complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specifically acetylates histone H4 and H2A, and therefore loosen the histone-DNA contacts, resulting in increased transcriptional activity. Here we present a near-atomic resolution structure of NuA4 complex through cryonic electron microscopy. The structure comprises six subunits and a total of 5,000 amino acids, within which Eaf1 and Eaf2 twist against each other and span from Actin-Arp4 module to the platform subunit Tra1, forming the backbone of NuA4. The locations of four missing components including Yaf9, and Esa1, Yng2 and Eaf6 of Piccolo module were indicated based on the structure. Intriguingly, our biochemical data showed that NuA4 doesnt bind nucleosome in vitro, whereas possesses strong histone acetyltransferase activity. Its Piccolo module, which has long been regarded as the catalytic module of NuA4, acetylates the nucleosome substrate at almost the same efficiency, but is capable of binding nucleosome. Combining the structural and biochemical data give rise to a model in which the entire NuA4 adopts an auto-inhibited conformation, and undergoes structural rearrangements upon substrate and co-factor additions, restoring its capacity of nucleosome-binding and activity of hyper-acetylation.",

    "abstract": "Bioprinting facilitates the generation of complex, three-dimensional (3D), cell-based constructs for various applications. Although multiple bioprinting technologies have been developed, extrusion-based systems have become the dominant technology due to the diversity of materials (bioinks) that can be utilized, either individually or in combination. However, each bioink has unique material properties and extrusion characteristics that affect bioprinting utility, accuracy, and precision. Here, we have extended our previous work to achieve high precision (i.e., repeatability) across samples by optimizing bioink-specific printing parameters. Specifically, we hypothesized that an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) could be used as a computational method to address the imprecision in 3D bioprinting test data and uncover the optimal printing parameters for a specific bioink that result in high accuracy and precision. To test this hypothesis, we have implemented an ANFIS model consisting of four inputs (bioink concentration, printing pressure, speed, and temperature) and a single output to quantify the precision (scaffold bioprinted linewidth range). We validate our use of the bioprinting precision index (BPI) with both standard and normalized printability factors. In total, our results indicate that computational methods are a cost-efficient measure to improve the precision and robustness of extrusion 3D bioprinting with gelatin-based bioinks.",

    "abstract": "Respiration and blood pressure (BP) are regulated to maintain optimal delivery of O2 to every cell in the body. Arterial hypoxemia is sensed by the carotid body (CB), which initiates sympathetic reflex arcs to the diaphragm to increase ventilation, and to the adrenal medulla (AM) to increase catecholamine secretion and thereby increase BP. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully delineated. Here, we report that the relative activities of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and HIF-2 determine the set point for the CB and AM, with respect to their maintenance of BP and respiration. In Hif2a+/- mice, which are heterozygous for a knockout allele at the locus encoding HIF-2, expression of HIF-1 and NADPH oxidase 2 was increased in the CB and AM, resulting in an oxidized intracellular redox state with augmented sensitivity to hypoxia, increased BP, and respiratory abnormalities, which were all normalized by treatment with a HIF-1 inhibitor or a superoxide anion scavenger. By contrast, in Hif1a+/- mice, which are heterozygous for a knockout allele at the locus encoding HIF-1, the expression of HIF-2 and superoxide dismutase 2 was increased in the CB and AM, resulting in a reduced intracellular redox state with impaired CB and ventilatory responses to chronic hypoxia, which were normalized by treatment with a HIF-2 inhibitor. None of the abnormalities that were observed in Hif1a+/- or Hif2a+/- mice were observed in Hif1a+/-; Hif2a+/- double- heterozygous mice. Our results demonstrate that redox balance in the CB and AM, which is determined by mutual antagonism between HIF- isoforms, establishes the set point for responses of the CB and AM to hypoxia, and is required for the maintenance of normal BP and respiration.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are able to suppress viremia and prevent infection. Their induction by vaccination is therefore a major goal. However, in contrast to antibodies that neutralize other pathogens, HIV-1-specific bNAbs frequently carry uncommon molecular characteristics that might prevent their induction. Here, we performed unbiased sequence analyses of B cell receptor repertoires from 57 healthy and 46 chronically HIV-1- or HCV-infected individuals and learned probabilistic models to predict the likelihood of bNAb development. We formally show that lower probabilities for bNAbs are predictive of higher HIV-1 neutralization activity. Moreover, ranking of bNAbs by their probabilities allowed to identify highly potent antibodies with superior generation probabilities as preferential targets for vaccination approaches. Importantly, we found equal bNAb probabilities across infected and healthy donors. This implies that chronic infection is not a prerequisite for the generation of bNAbs, fostering the hope that HIV-1 vaccines can induce bNAb development in healthy individuals.\n\nSignificance StatementWhile HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can develop in chronically HIV-1-infected individuals, they could not yet be elicited by active vaccination. Here, we computationally demonstrate that HIV-1 bNAbs carry distinct sequence features making them unlikely outcomes of the antibody evolution. However, our approach allowed us to identify bNAbs with higher probabilities of being generated. These candidates can now serve as the most promising targets to be induced by vaccination. Moreover, we show that chronic infection has no influence on the probabilities of finding typical bNAb sequence features in the memory B cell compartment. Both findings are critical to design effective vaccination strategies.",

    "abstract": "Antigen-specific T-cells are a powerful modality for treating cancer and other life-threatening viral and bacterial diseases. Technologies to identify and expand antigen-specific T-cells rapidly can shorten the time, and lower the cost of treatment. In this regard, screening short overlapping peptides to identify antigen-specific T-cells in ex vivo T-cell activation assay is becoming routine. Screening assays typically use 15-mer peptides to stimulate patient-derived, or healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells to activate T-cells and identify expanded TCRs by next generation sequencing. Previous studies comparing the kinetics of T-cell activation using a 9 and a 15-mer peptide versions of a CMV immunodominant epitope demonstrated that 15-mer peptides induced CD8 T-cell activation at a slower kinetics reaching a lower magnitude compared to 9-mer peptides. The fact that 9-mer peptides are an optimal fit for the MHC class-I binding groove could explain this difference, with the 15-mer peptide requiring additional proteolytic processing before binding to the deeper binding groove of class-I MHC. Alternatively, the delay in kinetics and magnitude can result from the activation of a wider diversity of TCRs engaging novel epitopes generated from the 15-mer peptide whose activation profile may be different from the profile of TCRs that normally respond to the 9-mer immunodominant epitope. We sought to address these two possibilities by comparing T-cell engagement to the HLA-2-restricted GILGFVFTL epitope presented as a 9-mer, or a 15-mer peptide and analyzing CDR3 expansion as a measure of T-cell engagement diversity. This approach also addressed an important question as to whether optimal TCRs could be missed using a 15-mer peptide used routinely in screening assays.",

Here we investigated the properties of prions causing the first case of Finnish moose CWD. While Finnish and Norwegian moose CWD prions share characteristics that distinguish them from North American CWD including the inability to replicate in lymphoid tissues, common responses to variations at residue 226 of host prion protein, and overlapping central nervous system profiles, they also exhibit pronounced conformational variation which is consistent with strain differences between Finnish and Norwegian moose CWD. Our findings support the existence of a surprisingly diverse portfolio of emergent CWD strains in Nordic countries that is etiologically distinct from North American CWD.\n\nSummary linePrion strain properties from the first case of chronic wasting disease in a Finnish moose are similar but not identical to Norwegian cases, supporting a growing population of strains in Nordic countries.",

    "abstract": "Viruses interact with the intracellular transport machinery to promote viral replication. Such host-virus interactions can drive host gene adaptation, leaving signatures of pathogen-driven evolution in host genomes. Here we leverage these genetic signatures to identify the dynein activating adaptor, ninein-like (NINL), as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and as a target of viral antagonism. Unique among genes encoding components of active dynein complexes, NINL has evolved under recurrent positive (diversifying) selection, particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo binding region. Consistent with a role for NINL in host immunity, we demonstrate that NINL knockout cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon, resulting in increased permissiveness to viral replication. Moreover, we show that proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. Our work reveals the importance of NINL in the antiviral response and the utility of using signatures of host-virus conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.",

    "abstract": "Although extensive astrocyte activation is present in the CNS of patients suffering from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), little is known about the contribution of reactive astrocytes to HAND neuropathology. Here, we report that the imbalance between neurotoxic (A1 astrocytes) and protective astrocytes (A2 astrocytes) occurring in HIV-1 gp120 transgenic mice impedes the resolution of inflammation in the CNS, perpetuating neuron damage and cognitive deficits. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a tryptophan metabolite with 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7nAChR) inhibitory property, blunts gp120-induced A1 astrocyte activation while promoting A2 astrocyte formation through blockade of 7nAChR/JAK2/STAT3 signaling activation. Meanwhile, we provide evidence that 7nAChR deletion and tryptophan administration convert astrocyte phenotypes, ultimately facilitating neuronal and cognitive improvement in the gp120tg mice. These initial and determinant findings mark a turning point in our understanding of the role of 7nAChR in gp120-mediated astrocyte activation, which opens new opportunities to control reactive astrocyte generation through KYNA and tryptophan administration as a pharmacological approach for treating HAND.",

Here, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of native human chromatin reveals novel folding motifs such as 1) non-uniform nucleosome stacking, 2) intermittent parallel and perpendicular orientations of adjacent nucleosome planes, and 3) an inverse zigzag nucleosome chain path, which deviates from the direct zigzag topology seen in reconstituted nucleosomal arrays. By examining these self-associated structures, we observed prominent nucleosome stacking in-cis and anti-parallel nucleosome interactions in-trans, which are consistent with partial nucleosome interdigitation. Histone citrullination strongly inhibits nucleosome stacking and self-association with a modest effect on chromatin folding, while the reconstituted arrays showed a zigzag topology which undergoes a dramatic unfolding induced by histone citrullination.

    "abstract": "Marine sponges have recently been recognised as natural samplers of environmental DNA (eDNA) due to their effective water filtration and their ubiquitous, sessile and regenerative nature. However, laboratory workflows for metabarcoding of sponge tissue have not been optimised to ensure that these natural samplers achieve their full potential for community survey. We used a phased approach to investigate the influence of DNA isolation procedures on the biodiversity information recovered from sponges. In Phase 1, we compared three treatments of residual ethanol preservative in sponge tissue alongside five DNA extraction protocols. The results of Phase 1 informed which ethanol treatment and DNA extraction protocol should be used in Phase 2, where we assessed the effect of starting tissue mass on extraction success and whether homogenisation of sponge tissue is required. Phase 1 results indicated that ethanol preservative may contain unique and/or additional biodiversity information to that present in sponge tissue, but blotting tissue dry generally recovered more taxa and generated more sequence reads from the wild sponge species. Tissue extraction protocols performed best in terms of DNA concentration, taxon richness and proportional read counts, but the non-commercial tissue protocol was selected for Phase 2 due to cost-efficiency and greater recovery of target taxa. In Phase 2 overall, we found that homogenisation may not be required for sponge tissue and more starting material does not necessarily improve taxon detection. These results combined provide an optimised DNA isolation procedure for sponges to enhance marine biodiversity assessment using natural sampler DNA metabarcoding.",

While disruption of these cues is known to lead to aberrant cell behavior and chronic diseases, such as tendinopathies, the underlying mechanisms by which mechanical signals maintain cell function is not well understood. Here, we show using a novel model of tendon de-tensioning that loss of tensile cues in vivo acutely changes nuclear morphology, positioning, and expression of catabolic gene programs. Using paired ATAC/RNAseq, we further identify that a loss of cellular tension rapidly reduces chromatin accessibility in the vicinity of Yap/Taz genomic targets while also increasing expression of genes involved in matrix catabolism. Overexpression of Yap results in a reduction of chromatin accessibility at matrix catabolic gene loci, while also reducing transcriptional levels. Concordantly, depletion of Yap/Taz elevates matrix catabolic expression. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of Yap not only prevents the induction of a broad catabolic program following a loss of cellular tension, but also preserves the underlying chromatin state from force-induced alterations. Taken together, these results provide novel mechanistic details by which mechanical signals regulate tendon cell function to preserve matrix homeostasis through a Yap/Taz axis.\n\nSignificance StatementCells integrate mechanical signals to regulate biological outputs within tissues. These processes are required for tissue function and homeostasis. Here, we show how mechanical cues (e.g. tension) directs tendon cell function and fate at a transcriptional and epigenetic level. Furthermore, we show that disruption of these mechanical cues leads to a disease-like cell state, indicating these mechanosensitive pathways could be important for diseases driven by perturbed mechanical signaling, such as tendinopathy.

Climatic seasonality and mobile genetic elements, associated with the transmission of antibiotic resistance, were also key drivers of their global distribution. Dominant ARGs were mainly related to multidrug resistance genes and efflux pump machineries. We further pinpointed the global hotspots of the diversity and proportions of soil ARGs.\n\nConclusionsTogether, our work provides the foundation for a better understanding of the ecology and global distribution of the environmental soil antibiotic resistome.",

    "abstract": "Type II topoisomerases modulate chromosome supercoiling, condensation, and catenation by moving one double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in a second duplex. How DNA strands are chosen and selectively passed to yield appropriate topological outcomes - e.g., decatenation vs. catenation - is poorly understood. Here we show that at physiological enzyme concentrations, eukaryotic type IIA topoisomerases (topo IIs) readily coalesce into condensed bodies. DNA stimulates condensation and fluidizes these assemblies to impart liquid-like behavior. Condensation induces both budding yeast and human topo IIs to switch from DNA unlinking to active DNA catenation, and depends on an unstructured C-terminal region, the loss of which leads to high levels of knotting and reduced catenation. Our findings establish that local protein concentration and phase separation can regulate how topo II creates or dissolves DNA links, behaviors that can account for the varied roles of the enzyme in supporting transcription, replication, and chromosome compaction.",

    "abstract": "PRPP synthase (PRPS) transfers the pyrophosphate groups from ATP to ribose-5-phosphate to produce 5-phosphate ribose-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of several metabolites including nucleotides, dinucleotides and some amino acids. There are three PRPS isoforms encoded in human genome. While hPRPS1 and hPRPS2 are expressed in most tissues, hPRPS3 is exclusively expressed in testis. Although hPRPS1 and hPRPS2 share 95% sequence identity, hPRPS2 has been shown to be less sensitive to allosteric inhibition and specifically upregulated in certain cancers in the translational level. Recent studies demonstrate that PRPS can form a subcellular compartment termed the cytoophidium in multiple organisms across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Forming the cytoophidium is considered as a distinctive mechanism involving the polymerization of the protein. In order to investigate the function and molecular mechanism of hPRPS2 polymerization, we solve the polymer structure of hPRPS2 at 3.08[A] resolution using cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). hPRPS2 hexamers stack into polymers in the conditions with the allosteric/competitive inhibitor ADP. The binding modes of ADP at the canonical allosteric site and at the catalytic active site are clearly determined. A point mutation disrupting the inter-hexamer interaction prevents hPRPS2 polymerization and results in significantly reduced catalytic activity. Our findings suggest that the regulation of hPRPS2 polymer is distinct from E. coli PRPS polymer and provide new insights to the regulation of hPRPS2 with structural basis.",

As such, exhaustive searches of sequence space to maximize library size are computationally intractable with existing methods. Here, we present SeqWalk, a time and memory efficient method for designing maximally-sized orthogonal sequence libraries using the sequence symmetry minimization heuristic. SeqWalk encodes sequence design constraints in a de Bruijn graph representation of sequence space, enabling the application of efficient graph traversal techniques to the problem of orthogonal DNA sequence design. We demonstrate the scalability of SeqWalk by designing a provably maximal set of > 106 orthogonal 25nt sequences in less than 20 seconds on a single standard CPU core. We additionally derive fundamental bounds on orthogonal sequence library size under a variety of design constraints.",

    "abstract": "Migrasomes are recently discovered signalling organelles, enriched with tetraspanin proteins (TSPAN)1. They form by local swelling of retraction fibers, the cylindrical protrusions of cell membranes that form as a result of cell migration along external substrates. Migrasomes can grow up to several micrometers in diameter2, and allow cells to release contents such as chemokines at specific locations, hence, transmitting signals to surrounding cells through the relevant chemokine receptors. Recently, evidence emerged showing that migrasomes play essential roles in fundamental cellular processes such transfer of mRNA and proteins3, organ morphogenesis4, and mitochondria quality control5. Thus, understanding the mechanism of migrasome biogenesis is of outstanding importance. Previously, it was established that the molecules crucial for migrasome formation are tetraspanin proteins and cholesterol forming macrodomains in the migrasome membrane, while the physical forces driving local swelling of the retraction fibers originate from membrane tension and bending rigidity1. Yet, it remained unknown how and in which time sequence these factors are involved in migrasome nucleation, growth, and stabilization, and what are the possible intermediate stages of migrasome biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between fibroblasts and immune cells play an important role in tissue inflammation. Previous studies have found that eosinophils activated with interleukin-3 (IL-3) degranulate on aggregated immunoglobulin G (IgG) and release mediators that activate fibroblasts in the lung. However, these studies were done with eosinophil-conditioned media that have the capacity to investigate only one-way signaling from eosinophils to fibroblasts. Here, we demonstrate a coculture model of primary normal human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) and human blood eosinophils from patients with allergy and asthma using an open microfluidic coculture device. In our device, the two types of cells can communicate via two-way soluble factor signaling in the shared media while being physically separated by a half wall. Initially, we assessed the level of eosinophil degranulation by their release of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). Next, we analyzed the inflammation-associated genes and soluble factors using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and multiplex immunoassays, respectively. Our results suggest an induction of a proinflammatory fibroblast phenotype of HLFs following the coculture with degranulating eosinophils, validating our previous findings. Additionally, we present a new result that indicate potential impacts of activated HLFs back on eosinophils. This open microfluidic coculture platform provides unique opportunities to investigate the intercellular signaling between the two cell types and their roles in airway inflammation and remodeling.",

    "abstract": "1CRISPR editing has enabled the rapid creation of fluorescent Plasmodium transgenic lines, facilitating a deeper understanding of parasite biology. The impact of genetic perturbations such as gene disruption or the introduction of drug resistance alleles on parasite fitness is typically quantified in competitive growth assays between the query line and a wild type reference. Although fluorescent reporter lines offer a facile and frequently used method to measure relative growth, this approach is limited by the strain background of the existing reporter, which may not match the growth characteristics of the query strains, particularly if these are slower-growing field isolates. Here, we demonstrate an efficient CRISPR-based approach to generate fluorescently labelled parasite lines using mNeonGreen derived from the LanYFP protein in Branchiostoma lanceolatum, which is one of the brightest monomeric green fluorescent proteins identified. Using a positive-selection approach by insertion of an in-frame blasticidin S deaminase marker, we generated a Dd2 reporter line expressing mNeonGreen under the control of the pfpare (P. falciparum Prodrug Activation and Resistance Esterase) locus. We selected the pfpare locus as an integration site because it is highly conserved across P. falciparum strains, expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic cycle, not essential, and offers the potential for negative selection to further enrich for integrants. The mNeonGreen@pare line demonstrates strong fluorescence with a negligible fitness defect. In addition, the construct developed can serve as a tool to fluorescently tag other P. falciparum strains for in vitro experimentation.",

    "abstract": "1Metabolic models are typically characterized by a large number of parameters. Traditionally, metabolic control analysis is applied to differential equation-based models to investigate the sensitivity of predictions to parameters. A corresponding theory for constraint-based models is lacking, due to their formulation as optimization problems. Here, we show that optimal solutions of optimization problems can be efficiently differentiated using constrained optimization duality and implicit differentiation. We use this to calculate the sensitivities of predicted reaction fluxes and enzyme concentrations to turnover numbers in an enzyme-constrained metabolic model of Escherichia coli. The sensitivities quantitatively identify rate limiting enzymes and are mathematically precise, unlike current finite difference based approaches used for sensitivity analysis. Further, efficient differentiation of constraint-based models unlocks the ability to use gradient information for parameter estimation. We demonstrate this by improving, genome-wide, the state-of-the-art turnover number estimates for E. coli. Finally, we show that this technique can be generalized to arbitrarily complex models. By differentiating the optimal solution of a model incorporating both thermodynamic and kinetic rate equations, the effect of metabolite concentrations on biomass growth can be elucidated. We benchmark these metabolite sensitivities against a large experimental gene knockdown study, and find good alignment between the predicted sensitivities and in vivo metabolome changes. In sum, we demonstrate several applications of differentiating optimal solutions of constraint-based metabolic models, and show how it connects to classic metabolic control analysis.",

    "abstract": "The spatial segregation of pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH) into distinct, membrane-less nuclear compartments involves the binding of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) to H3K9me2/3-rich genomic regions. While HP1 exhibits liquid-liquid phase separation properties in vitro, its mechanistic impact on the structure and dynamics of PCH condensate formation in vivo remains largely unresolved. Here, using biophysical modeling, we systematically investigate the mutual coupling between self-interacting HP1-like molecules and the chromatin polymer. We reveal that the specific affinity of HP1 for H3K9me2/3 loci facilitates coacervation in nucleo, and promotes the formation of stable PCH condensates at HP1 levels far below the concentration required to observe phase separation in purified protein assays in vitro. These heterotypic HP1-chromatin interactions give rise to a strong dependence of the nucleoplasmic HP1 density on HP1-H3K9me2/3 stoichiometry, consistent with the thermodynamics of multicomponent phase separation. The dynamical crosstalk between HP1 and the viscoelastic chromatin scaffold also leads to anomalously-slow equilibration kinetics, which strongly depend on the genomic distribution of H3K9me2/3 domains, and result in the coexistence of multiple long-lived, microphase-separated PCH compartments. The morphology of these complex coacervates is further found to be governed by the dynamic establishment of the underlying H3K9me2/3 landscape, which may drive their increasingly abnormal, aspherical shapes during cell development. These findings compare favorably to 4D microscopy measurements of HP1 condensates that we perform in live Drosophila embryos, and suggest a general quantitative model of PCH formation based on the interplay between HP1-based phase separation and chromatin polymer mechanics.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe compartmentalization of pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH), the highly-repetitive part of the genome, into membrane-less organelles enriched in HP1 proteins, is critical to both genetic stability and cell fate determination. While HP1 can self-organize into liquid-like condensates in vitro, the roles of HP1 and the polymer chromatin in forming 3D PCH domains in vivo are still unclear. Using molecular simulations, we show that key kinetic and thermodynamic features of PCH condensates are consistent with a phase-separation mode of organization driven by the genomic distribution of methylated domains and HP1 self-attraction and affinity for heterochromatin. Our predictions are corroborated by live-microscopy performed during early fly embryogenesis, suggesting that a strong crosstalk between HP1-based phase separation and chromosome mechanics drive PCH condensate formation.",

    "abstract": "A yet unresolved challenge in structural biology is to quantify conformational states of proteins underpinning function. This challenge is particularly acute for membrane proteins owing to the difficulties in stabilising them for in vitro studies. To address this challenge, we present here an integrative strategy that combines hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) with ensemble modelling. We benchmark our strategy on wild type and mutant conformers of XylE, a prototypical member of the ubiquitous Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters. Next, we apply our strategy to quantify conformational ensembles of XylE embedded in different lipid environments and identify key lipid contacts that modulate protein conformations. Further application of our integrative strategy to substrate-bound and inhibitor-bound ensembles, allowed us to unravel protein-ligand interactions contributing to the alternating access mechanism of secondary transport in atomistic detail. Overall, our study highlights the potential of integrative HDX-MS modelling to capture, accurately quantify and subsequently visualise co-populated states of membrane proteins in association with mutations and diverse substrates and inhibitors.\n\nFor Table of Content Only\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=117 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499559v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf7b35org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1da1eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f70627org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b52b90_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
