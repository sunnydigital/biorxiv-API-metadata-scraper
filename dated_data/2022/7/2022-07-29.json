    "abstract": "2.Here we present the R package - MinSNPs. This is designed to assemble resolution optimised sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from alignments such as genome wide orthologous SNP matrices. We also demonstrate a pipeline for assembling such matrices from multiple bio-projects, so as to facilitate SNP set derivation from globally representative data sets. MinSNPs can derive sets of SNPs optimised for discriminating any user-defined combination of sequences from all others. Alternatively, SNP sets may be optimised to discriminate all from all, i.e., to maximise diversity. MinSNPs encompasses functions that facilitate rapid and flexible SNP mining, and clear and comprehensive presentation of the results. The MinSNPs running time scales in a linear fashion with input data volume, and the numbers of SNPs and SNPs sets specified in the output. MinSNPs was tested using a previously reported orthologous SNP matrix of Staphylococcus aureus. and an orthologous SNP matrix of 3,279 genomes with 164,335 SNPs assembled from four S. aureus short read genomic data sets. MinSNPs demonstrated efficacy in deriving discriminatory SNP sets for potential surveillance targets and in identifying SNP sets optimised to discriminate isolates from different clonal complexes (CC). MinSNPs was also tested with a large Plasmodium vivax orthologous SNP matrix. A set of five SNPs was derived that reliably indicated the country of origin within 3 south-east Asian countries. In summary, we report the capacity to assemble comprehensive SNP matrices that effectively capture microbial genomic diversity, and to rapidly and flexibly mine these entities for optimised surveillance marker sets.\n\n3. Impact statementWe present the R package \"MinSNPs\". This derives resolution optimised SNP sets from datasets of genome sequence variation. Such SNP sets can underpin targeted genetic analysis for high throughput surveillance of microbial variants of public health concern. MinSNPs supports considerable flexibility in search methods. The package allows non-specialist bioinformaticians to easily and quickly convert global scale data of intra-specific genomic variation into SNP sets precisely and efficiently directed towards many microbial genetic analysis tasks.\n\n4.

    "abstract": "Sexually dimorphic behavior is pervasive across animals, with males and females exhibiting different mate selection, parental care, foraging, dispersal, and territorial strategies. However, the genetic underpinnings of sexually dimorphic behaviors are poorly understood. Here we investigate gene networks and expression patterns associated with sexually dimorphic imprinting-like learning in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. In this species, both males and females learn visual preferences, but learn preferences for different traits and use different signals as salient, unconditioned cues. To identify genes and gene networks associated with this behavior, we examined gene expression profiles of the brains and eyes of male and female butterflies immediately post training and compared them to the same tissues of naive individuals. We found more differentially expressed genes and a greater number of significant gene networks in the eye, indicating a role of the peripheral nervous system in visual imprinting-like learning. Females had higher chemoreceptor expression levels than males, supporting the hypothesized sexual dimorphic use of chemical cues during the learning process. In addition, genes that influence B. anynana wing patterns (sexual ornaments), such as invected, spalt, and apterous, were also differentially expressed in the brain and eye, suggesting that these genes may influence both sexual ornaments and the preferences for these ornaments. Our results indicate dynamic and sex-specific responses to social scenario in both the peripheral and central nervous systems and highlight the potential role of wing patterning genes in mate preference and learning across the Lepidoptera.",

    "abstract": "Opsin 3 (Opn3) is a light-sensitive protein present throughout the mammalian brain, although its functions in this organ are currently unknown. Since Opn3 encoded mRNA increases in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus in response to hyperosmotic stimuli, we have explored the role of Opn3 in this nucleus. By in situ hybridization, we have demonstrated that Opn3 is expressed in neurones expressing both arginine vasopressin and oxytocin in the rat SON, suggesting that OPN3 functions in both neuronal types. Gene profiling analysis by RNA-seq suggested that neuropeptide production is impaired when knocking down Opn3 in the rat SON, as confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunolabelling. Knocking down Opn3 in the rat SON altered physiological parameters including water intake, body temperature and motor activity. Altogether the data indicates that Opn3 in the SON is involved in the regulation of a number of neuropeptides and other proteins that participate in water homeostasis, body temperature and motor activity.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway exerts strong antiviral activity through the downstream interferon (IFN) production; however, it has been recently recognized that IFN independent activity of STING also plays an important role in antiviral functions. Nevertheless, the IFN independent antiviral activity of STING is not fully understood. In this study, we showed that porcine STING (pSTING) played a critical role in anti-HSV1 and anti-VSV infections, and IFN defective mutants including pSTING pLxIS sub, S365A and {Delta}CTT all exhibited similar antiviral functions to wild type (WT) pSTING. Further, all these IFN defective pSTING mutants possessed a comparable autophagy activity relative to WT pSTING as expected. From pSTING WT, S365A and {Delta}CTT, the residues responsible for autophagy were mutated, which included L333A/R334A, Y167A/L170A and Y245A/L248A, respectively. Surprisingly, all these autophagy defective pSTING mutants still resisted from the two viral infections, demonstrating the pSTING antiviral function independent of IFN as well as autophagy. On the other hand, all the autophagy defective pSTING mutants triggered cell apoptosis, which was associated with the antiviral functions. Additionally, pSTING lost its antiviral activity in TBK1-/- and IRF3-/- porcine macrophages, indicating the involvement of TBK1 and IRF3 in other STING activity such as apoptosis. Collectively, our results revealed that STING exerts both IFN and autophagy independent antiviral activity, and also suggested that STING triggered cell apoptosis might resist from virus infections.",

    "abstract": "Omicron has demonstrated a competitive advantage over Delta in vaccinated people. To understand this, we designed a transmission chain experiment using naive, intranasally (IN) or intramuscularly (IM) vaccinated, and previously infected (PI) hamsters. Vaccination and previous infection protected animals from disease and virus replication after Delta and Omicron dual challenge. A gradient in transmission blockage was observed: IM vaccination displayed moderate transmission blockage potential over three airborne chains (approx. 70%), whereas, IN vaccination and PI blocked airborne transmission in >90%. In naive hamsters, Delta completely outcompeted Omicron within and between hosts after dual infection in onward transmission. Although Delta also outcompeted Omicron in the vaccinated and PI transmission chains, an increase in Omicron competitiveness was observed in these groups. This correlated with the increase in the strength of the humoral response against Delta, with the strongest response seen in PI animals. These data highlight the continuous need to assess the emergence and spread of novel variants in populations with pre-existing immunity and address the additional evolutionary pressure this may exert on the virus.",

    "abstract": "The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is associated with host defense against many intracellular pathogens, including Legionella pneumophila. Legionella causes the severe pneumonia Legionnaires Disease and predominantly affects individuals with a suppressed immune system, such as those receiving therapeutic TNF blockade to treat autoinflammatory disorders. TNF induces pro-inflammatory gene expression, cellular proliferation, and survival signals in certain contexts, but can also trigger programmed cell death in others. It remains unclear, however, which of the many downstream activities of TNF contribute to control of intracellular bacterial pathogens like Legionella. In this study, we demonstrate that TNF signaling licenses macrophages to die rapidly in response to Legionella infection. We find that TNF-licensed cells undergo rapid gasdermin-dependent, pyroptotic death downstream of inflammasome activation. We also find that TNF signaling upregulates components of the inflammasome response, and that the caspase-11 mediated non-canonical inflammasome is the first inflammasome to be activated, with caspase-1 and caspase-8 mediating delayed pyroptotic death. We find that all three caspases are collectively required for optimal TNF-mediated restriction of bacterial replication in macrophages. Furthermore, caspase-8 is required for control of pulmonary Legionella infection. These findings reveal a TNF-dependent mechanism in macrophages for the activation of rapid cell death that is collectively mediated by caspases-1, -8, and -11 and subsequent restriction of Legionella infection.",

The cellular and secreted forms of TraC are monomers, TraC preferentially localizes at the cell poles and it is also detected in extracellular membrane vesicles. Purified TraC does not impact the infection with bacteriophages, but we detect binding of TraC to recipient cells and partial complementation of a traC deletion strain by the addition of purified TraC.

    "abstract": "BackgroundNucleic acid extraction is a crucial step for molecular biology applications, being a determinant for any diagnostic test procedure. Dried blood spots (DBS) have been used for decades for serology, drug monitoring, environmental investigations, and molecular studies. Nevertheless, nucleic acid extraction from DBS remains one of the main challenges to translate them to the point-of-care (POC).\n\nMethodWe have developed a fast nucleic acid extraction (NAE) method from DBS which is electricity-free and relies on cellulose filter papers (DBSFP). The performance of NAE was assessed with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), targeting the human reference gene beta-actin. The developed method was evaluated against FTA cards and magnetic bead-based purification, using time-to-positive (min) for comparative analysis. We optimised and validated the developed method for elution (eluted disk) and disk directly in the reaction (in-situ disk), RNA and DNA detection, and whole blood stored in anticoagulants (K2EDTA and lithium heparin). Furthermore, the compatibility of DBSFP with colourimetric detection was studied to show the transferability to the POC.\n\nResultsThe proposed DBSFP is based on grade 3 filter paper pre-treated with 8% (v/v) igepal surfactant, 1 min washing step with PBS 1X and elution in TE 1X buffer after 5 min incubation at room temperature, enabling NAE under 7 min. Obtained results were comparable to gold standard methods across tested matrices, targets and experimental conditions, demonstrating the versatility of the methodology. Lastly, eluted disk colourimetric detection was achieved with a sample-to-result turnaround time under 35 min.\n\nConclusionsThe developed method is a fast, electricity-free, and low-cost solution for NAE from DBSFP enabling molecular testing in virtually any POC setting.",

    "abstract": "Room-temperature X-ray crystallography provides unique insights into protein conformational heterogeneity, but a common hurdle is obtaining sufficiently large protein crystals. Serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) helps address this hurdle by allowing the use of many medium- to small-sized crystals. We have used a recently introduced serial sample support chip system to obtain the first SSX structure of a human phosphatase, specifically Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in the unliganded (apo) state. In previous apo room-temperature structures, the active site and allosteric sites adopted alternate conformations, including open and closed conformations for the active-site WPD loop and for a distal allosteric site. By contrast, in our SSX structure, the active site is best fit with a single conformation, but the distal allosteric site is best fit with alternate conformations. This observation argues for additional nuance in interpreting the nature of allosteric coupling in this protein. Overall, our results illustrate the promise of serial methods for room-temperature crystallography, as well as future avant-garde crystallography experiments, for PTP1B and other proteins.",

Here we describe new inhibitors of pathogenic DNA sensing, primarily of the inflammasome forming sensor AIM2.

Though less potent, these AIM2 inhibitors, 4-sulfonic calixarenes, also inhibit DNA sensors cGAS and TLR9 demonstrating a broad utility against pathogenic DNA-driven inflammatory responses. The 4-sulfonic calixarenes inhibited AIM2 dependent post-stroke T cell death, highlighting a proof of concept that the 4-sulfonic calixarenes could be effective at combatting post-stroke immunosuppression. By extension, we propose a broad utility against DNA driven inflammation in disease. Finally, we reveal that the ancient drug suramin, by virtue of its structural similarities, is an excellent inhibitor of DNA-dependent inflammation and propose that suramin could be rapidly repurposed to meet an ever increasing clinical need.",

    "abstract": "In microbiology, the estimation of the growth rate of microorganisms is a critical parameter to describe a new strain or characterize optimal growth conditions. Traditionally, this parameter is estimated by selecting subjectively the exponential phase of the growth, and then determining the slope of this curve section, by linear regression. However, for some experiments, the number of points to describe the growth can be very limited, and consequently such linear model will not fit, or the parameters estimation can much lower and strongly variable. In this paper, we propose a tools to estimate growth parameters using a logistic Verhulst model that take into account the entire growth curve for the estimation of the growth rate. The efficiency of such model is compared to the linear model. Finally, the novelty of our work is to propose a \"Shiny-web application\", online, without any programming or modelling skills, to allow estimating growth parameters including growth rate, maximum population, and beginning of the exponential phase, as well as an estimation of their variability. The final results can be displayed in the form of a scatter plot representing the model, its efficiency and the estimated parameters are downloadable.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of viruses between different host species is a major source of emerging diseases and is of particular concern in the case of zoonotic transmission from mammals to humans. Several zoonosis risk factors have been identified, but it is currently unclear which viral traits primarily influence this process, as previous work has focused on a few hundred viruses that are not representative of the actual viral diversity. Here we investigate fundamental virological traits that influence cross-species transmissibility and zoonotic propensity by interrogating a database of over 12,000 mammalian virus-host associations, obtained mainly from recent viral metagenomics projects. Our analysis reveals that enveloped viruses tend to infect more host species and are more likely to infect humans than non-enveloped viruses, while other viral traits such as genome composition, structure, size or the viral replication compartment play a minor role. This contrasts with the previous notion that viral envelopes did not significantly impact or even reduced zoonotic risk, and should help better prioritize outbreak prevention efforts. We suggest several mechanisms by which viral envelopes could promote cross-species transmissibility, including structural flexibility and evasion of viral entry barriers.",

    "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum, long known as a common oral microbe, has recently garnered attention for its ability to colonize tissues and tumors elsewhere in the human body. Clinical and epidemiological research has now firmly established F. nucleatum as an oncomicrobe associated with several major cancer types. However, with the current research focus on host associations, little is known about gene regulation in F. nucleatum itself, including global stress response pathways that typically ensure the survival of bacteria outside their primary niche. This is due to the phylogenetic distance of Fusobacteriota to most model bacteria, their limited genetic tractability, and paucity of known gene functions. Here, we characterize a global transcriptional stress response network governed by the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor, {sigma}E. To this aim, we developed several new genetic tools for this anaerobic bacterium, including four different fluorescent marker proteins, inducible gene expression, scarless gene deletion, and transcriptional and translational reporter systems. Using these tools, we identified a {sigma}E response partly reminiscent of phylogenetically distant Proteobacteria but induced by exposure to oxygen. Although F. nucleatum lacks canonical RNA chaperones such as Hfq, we uncovered conservation of the non-coding arm of the {sigma}E response in form of the non-coding RNA FoxI. This regulatory small RNA (sRNA) acts as an mRNA repressor of several membrane proteins, thereby supporting the function of {sigma}E. In addition to the characterization of a global stress response in F. nucleatum, the genetic tools developed here will enable further discoveries and dissection of regulatory networks in this early-branching bacterium.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFusobacterium nucleatum is an abundant member of the oral microbiome that can spread throughout the body and colonize secondary sites, including cancer tissues where it promotes tumor progression. Understanding how F. nucleatum is able to adapt to this new environment might open new therapeutic opportunities, but we currently lack basic molecular knowledge of gene regulation in this phylogenetically distinct bacterium. We developed much-needed genetic tools for use in F. nucleatum and with their aid uncovered a stress response mediated by the transcriptional activator {sigma}E and an associated small RNA. Our findings in an early-branching bacterium reveal surprising parallels to and differences from the {sigma}E response in well-characterized model bacteria and provide a framework that will accelerate research into the understudied phylum Fusobacteriota.",

    "abstract": "The development of single-cell sequencing technology has expanded the understanding of cell heterogeneity and disease progression in the male genitourinary system. However, complex processing processes and unprofessional analytical annotations limit the daily use and wildly sharing of published datasets. Here, we describe the Male Health Atlas (MHA), an easy-to-operate online visual website focused on the male genitourinary system, allowing researchers to quickly search for expression patterns of one or multiple genes, and dynamic changes of gene expression during tissue development or under pathological states. At present, the MHA includes nine objects, two species, five types of male genitourinary tissues/organs, and 258,777 single-cell profiles. Compared with other single-cell databases, the MHA has the following advantages: (1) It is easy to operate, and users can complete retrieval and output of results within 5 min without any bioinformatics skills; (2) The selection and analysis of data are under professional supervision of researchers in the male genitourinary field; (3) It contains most of the main male-specific organs and will continue to be updated; (4) MHA provides multi-dimensional output patterns, including tSNE/UMAP, violin, and bubble plot output for displaying single or multiple genes. MHA is the first single-cell database website in the field of andrology and male reproduction, providing researchers with scRNA-seq resources and an accessible tool.

Prior field studies offer partial insight into these processes but overlook animal ecologies and human perceptions and practices facilitating human-animal contact. Conducted in Cameroon and a European zoo, this holistic study elucidates these processes, integrating metagenomic, historical, anthropological and great ape ecological analyses, and real-time evaluation of human-great ape contact types and frequencies. Surprisingly, we find more enteric virome sharing between Cameroonian humans and great apes than in the zoo, a virome convergence between Cameroonian humans and gorillas, and adenovirus and enterovirus taxa as most frequently shared between Cameroonian humans and great apes. In addition to physical contact from hunting, meat handling and fecal exposure, overlapping human cultivation and gorilla pillaging in forest gardens explain these unexpected findings. Our multidisciplinary study identifies environmental co-use as a complementary mechanism for viral sharing.",

    "abstract": "Diverse RNA-RNA interactions occur throughout the lifecycle of RNA viruses, including genome dimerization or multimerization through non-covalent association of two or more genomic segments. Both homo-dimerization of retrovirus genomic RNA and hetero-multimerization of genomic segments of multipartite viruses are recognized as important factors that govern genome packaging. The heterodimer of the bipartite alphanodaviruses represents a unique case as its formation is conserved among different virus species but is only observed within the context of fully assembled virus particles. In spite of this, the RNA sequences involved in heterodimerization are unknown. It also remains unclear whether the formation of this heterodimer might impact any stage of the virus lifecycle. In this study, we used Flock House virus (FHV) as a model system to uncover the nucleotide composition of the heterodimer and dissected the impact of heterodimer formation upon numerous stages of the virus lifecycle. We developed a novel Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach called \"XL-ClickSeq\" to probe candidate heterodimer sequences. We found that the heterodimer is formed via intermolecular base-pairing and its formation is retained in defective virus particles. One heterodimer site was identified by thermodynamic prediction that, upon mutagenic disruption, exhibited significant deficiencies in genome packaging and encapsidation specificity to viral genomic RNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disruption of this RNA secondary structure directly impacts the thermostability of mature virus particles. These results demonstrated that the intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions within the encapsidated genome of an RNA virus can have an important impact on virus particle integrity and stability and thus its transmission to a new host.",

    "abstract": "The 18S rRNA sequence is highly conserved, particularly at its 3-end. In contrast, the sequence around the 3-end is degenerate with similar sites nearby. How RNA is correctly processed by the endonuclease Nob1 is not known, especially because in vitro experiments have shown it to be error-prone. Here we used yeast genetics, biochemistry, and next generation sequencing to investigate a role for Rio1 in monitoring the 3-end of 18S rRNA. We demonstrate that Nob1 can miscleave its rRNA substrate and that miscleaved rRNA accumulates upon bypassing the Rio1-mediated quality control step, but not in healthy cells with intact quality control mechanisms. Mechanistically, we show that Rio1 binding to miscleaved rRNA is weakened. Accordingly, excess Pno1 results in accumulation of miscleaved rRNA. Ribosomes containing miscleaved rRNA enter the polysomes and produce dominant negative growth defects, suggesting that they cause defects during translation. Our data strongly suggest that ribosome collisions identify these miscleaved 18S rRNA-containing ribosomes as partially functional and target them for degradation. Altogether, the data support a model in which Rio1 inspects the 3-end of the nascent 18S rRNA, only removing Nob1 and Pno1 from the ribosomes with precisely cleaved 18S rRNA to prevent miscleaved 18S rRNA-containing ribosomes from erroneously engaging in translation, where they induce ribosome collisions. The data also demonstrate how ribosome collisions \"purify\" the cells of altered ribosomes with different functionalities, with important implications for the concept of ribosome heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate gonads comprise three primary cell types, germ cells, steroidogenic cells, and supporting cells. The latter are the first cell type to differentiate in the embryonic gonad and direct the formation of other somatic lineages. During gonadal sex determination, the supporting cell lineage differentiates into Sertoli cells in males and pre-granulosa cells in females. In the chicken embryo, the molecular trigger for Sertoli cell differentiation is the Z-linked gene DMRT1. Recently, single cell RNA-seq data indicate that that chicken steroidogenic cells, derive from differentiated supporting cells. This differentiation process is achieved by a sequential upregulation of steroidogenic genes and down-regulation of supporting cell markers. The exact mechanism regulating this differentiation process remains unknown. We identified the gene TOX3 as a novel transcription factor expressed in embryonic Sertoli cells of the chicken testis. TOX3 knockdown in males resulted in increased CYP17A1 positive Leydig cells. TOX3 over-expression in male and female gonads resulted in a significant decline in CYP17A1 positive steroidogenic cells. TOX3 expression is negatively regulated by estrogens in vivo, but not induced during masculinization induced by estrogen inhibition. In ovo knock-down of the testis determinant, DMRT1, in male gonads resulted in a down-regulation of TOX3 expression. Conversely, DMRT1 over-expression caused an increase in TOX3 expression. Taken together, this data indicates that DMRT1 regulation of TOX3 modulates expansion of the steroidogenic lineage, either directly, via cell lineage allocation, or indirectly via signaling from the supporting to steroidogenic cell populations.",

We were interested in the mutagenic effects of particle radiation exposures on genomes of various human cell types, in order to gauge the genotoxic risks of galactic cosmic radiation, and of certain types of tumor radiotherapy. To this end, we exposed cultured cell lines from the human blood, breast and lung to intermittent proton and alpha particle (helium nuclei) beams at doses sufficient to considerably affect cell viability. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that mutation rates were not overall markedly increased upon proton and alpha exposures. However, there were changes in mutation spectra and distributions, such as the increases in clustered mutations and of certain types of indels and structural variants. The spectrum of mutagenic effects of particle beams may be cell-type and/or genetic background specific. Overall, the mutational effects of recurrent exposures to proton and alpha radiation on human cells in culture appear subtle, however further work is warranted to understand effects of long-term exposures on various human tissues.",

    "abstract": "Full-length transcript sequencing remains a main goal of RNA sequencing. However, even the application of long-read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies still fail to yield full-length transcript sequencing for a significant portion of sequenced reads. Since these technologies can sequence reads that are far longer than the longest known processed transcripts, the lack of efficiency to obtain full-length transcripts from good quality RNAs stems from library preparation inefficiency rather than the presence of degraded RNA molecules. It has previously been shown that addition of inverted terminal repeats in cDNA during reverse transcription followed by single-primer PCR creates a PCR suppression effect that prevents amplification of short molecules thus enriching the library for longer transcripts. We adapted this method for Nanopore cDNA library preparation and show that not only is PCR efficiency increased but gene body coverage is dramatically improved. The results show that implementation of this simple strategy will result in better quality full-length RNA sequencing data and make full-length transcript sequencing possible for most of sequenced reads.\n\nContribution to the fieldLong-read RNA sequencing aims to sequence expressed transcripts in their entirety. However, this has remained a challenge, mainly due to inherent inefficiencies in cDNA library preparation. Herein, we provide a new Nanopore cDNA library preparation protocol, termed Panhandle, that improves the efficiency of cDNA PCR with yields 2 - 8 times the yields obtained with ordinary PCR. This is key, as this should in turn reflect in the possibility of lowering the number of PCR cycles needed to obtain ample sequencing material, which in turn could reduce PCR biases, PCR artifacts, turnaround time, reagents, and could increase general quality of the library. Further, transcripts generated using the Panhandle method show better gene body coverage and more accurate transcription start site mapping than regular methods. This represents an important step towards full-length cDNA sequencing by Nanopore.",

Previous developments using stromal feeder layers, defined media cocktails, and bioengineering have enabled HSC expansion in culture, but of mostly short-term HSCs (ST-HSC) and progenitor populations at the expense of naive LT-HSCs. Here, we report the creation of a bioengineered LT-HSC maintenance niche that recreates physiological extracellular matrix organisation, using soft collagen type-I hydrogels to drive nestin expression in perivascular stromal cells (PerSCs or pericytes). We demonstrate that nestin, which is expressed by HSC-supportive bone marrow stromal cells, is cytoprotective and, via regulation of metabolism, is important for HIF-1 expression in PerSCs. When CD34+ve HSCs were added to the bioengineered niches comprising nestin/HIF-1 expressing PerSCs, LT-HSC numbers were maintained with normal clonal ability and without media supplementation. We provide proof-of-concept that our bioengineered niches can support the survival of CRISPR edited HSCs.

    "abstract": "The crowdedness of the cell calls for adequate intracellular organization. Biomolecular condensates, formed by liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins and nucleic acids, are important organizers of cellular fluids. To underpin the molecular mechanisms of protein condensation, cell-free studies are often used where the role of crowding is not investigated in detail. Here, we investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding on the formation and material properties of a model heterotypic biomolecular condensate, consisting of nucleophosmin (NPM1) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). We studied the effect of the macromolecular crowding agent PEG, which is often considered an inert crowding agent. We observed that PEG could induce both homotypic and heterotypic phase separation of NPM1 and NPM1-rRNA, respectively. Crowding increases the condensed concentration of NPM1 and decreases its equilibrium dilute phase concentration, while no significant change in the concentration of rRNA in the dilute phase was observed. Interestingly, the crowder itself is concentrated in the condensates, suggesting that co-condensation rather than excluded volume interactions underlie the enhanced phase separation by PEG. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements indicated that both NPM1 and rRNA become immobile at high PEG concentrations, indicative of a liquid-to-gel transition. Together, these results shed new light onto the role of synthetic crowding agents in phase separation, and demonstrate that condensate properties determined in vitro depend strongly on the addition of crowding agents.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCELiquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids leads to the formation of biomolecular condensates. To mimic biomolecular condensates in vitro, polymeric crowding agents, such as PEG, are often added. Such crowding agents are considered to make in vitro solutions more physiologically relevant, by mimicking the high cellular macromolecule concentrations. However, these crowding agents are commonly selected for their commercial availability and solubility in water, and their influence on phase separation and the physicochemical properties of condensates are seldom studied. Here we use biophysical methods to show that PEG induces phase separation of a model condensate through co-condensation rather than volume exclusion. As a consequence, crowding changes the partitioning, concentrations and viscoelastic properties of the condensates significantly, which sheds new light onto studies aimed at quantifying the material properties of biomolecular condensates.",

Ideally, novel vaccines should be easy and safe to administer, provide mucosal immunity, be safe to manufacture, and be affordable for low-income countries. Alternative delivery strategies, such as the intranasal route, may fulfill at least some of these preferred vaccine characteristics. Moreover, vaccination via mucosal routes has the potential to evoke strong mucosal immunity at the entry site.\n\nIn the current study, the potential of the intranasal route was investigated for an inactivated polio vaccine based on Sabin strains (sIPV). Different vaccination regimes for intranasal administration of sIPV were evaluated by measuring both systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice. Heterologous prime-boost schedules using a combination of parenteral and mucosal administration showed to elicit virus neutralizing antibody titers in serum and polio-specific IgA titers at different mucosal sites in mice that were vaccinated with sIPV. Moreover, the inclusion of an adjuvant was able to further enhance immune responses. Intranasal administration of adjuvanted sIPV combined with a regular intramuscular sIPV vaccination can significantly improve mucosal immune responses while maintaining systemic immune responses, which can lead to better protection against polio infection and possibly prevent virus transmission. An intranasally delivered inactivated polio vaccine might be of value for use in routine vaccination or outbreak control, and therefore, a helpful tool towards polio-eradication.",

Using simple gnotobiotic communities we could further demonstrate that T-cell activation against newly colonizing gut bacteria is restricted by previous bacteria colonization in GF mice. However, this restriction requires a functional adaptive immune system as Rag1-/- allowed B.theta-specific T cell proliferation even after previous colonization. Interestingly, this phenomenon seems to be dependent on the type of TCR-transgenic model used. B.theta-specific transgenic T cells also proliferated after gut colonization with an E.coli strain carrying the B.theta-specific epitope. However, this was not the case for the SM-1 transgenic T cells as they did not proliferate after similar gut colonization with an E.coli strain expressing the cognate epitope. In summary, we found that activation of T cells towards incoming bacteria in the gut is modulated by the influence of colonizing bacteria on the adaptive immune system of the host.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological and clinical evidence indicates that humans infected with the 1918 pandemic influenza virus and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses often displayed severe lung pathology. High viral load and extensive infiltration of macrophages are the hallmarks of highly pathogenic (HP) influenza viral infections. However, it remains unclear what biological mechanisms primarily determine the observed difference in the kinetics of viral load and macrophages between HP and low pathogenic (LP) viral infections, and how the mechanistic differences are associated with viral pathogenicity. In this study, we develop a mathematical model of viral dynamics that includes the dynamics of different macrophage populations and interferon. We fit the model to in vivo kinetic data of viral load and macrophage level from BALB/c mice infected with an HP or LP strain of H1N1/H5N1 virus using Bayesian inference. Our primary finding is that HP viruses has a higher viral infection rate, a lower interferon production rate and a lower macrophage recruitment rate compared to LP viruses, which are strongly associated with more severe tissue damage (quantified by a higher percentage of epithelial cell loss). We also quantify the relative contribution of macrophages to viral clearance and find that macrophages do not play a dominant role in direct clearance of free virus although their role in mediating immune responses such as interferon production is crucial. Our work provides new insight into the mechanisms that convey the observed difference in viral and macrophage kinetics between HP and LP infections and establishes an improved model fitting framework to enhance the analysis of new data on viral pathogenicity.\n\nAuthor SummaryInfections with highly pathogenic (HP) influenza virus (e.g., the 1918 pandemic virus) often lead to serious morbidity and mortality. HP influenza virus infection is characterised by rapid viral growth rate, high viral load and excessive infiltration of macrophages to the lungs. Despite extensive study, we do not yet fully understand what biological processes leading to the observed viral and macrophage dynamics and therefore viral pathogenicity. Experimental studies have previously suggested that bot viral factors (e.g., viral proteins) and host factors (e.g., the host immune response) play a role to enhance viral pathogenicity. Here, we utilise in vivo kinetic data of viral load and macrophages and fit a viral dynamic model the data. Our model allow us to explore the biological mechanisms that contribute to the difference viral and macrophage dynamics between HP and LP infections. This study improves our understanding of the role of interferon on distinguishing immunodynamics between HP and LP infections. Our findings may contribute to the development of next-generation treatment which rely upon an understanding of the host different immunological response to HP influenza viruses.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this investigation was to study the efficacy of UV-C light emitting diode system (LED) operating at 263 nm for the inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Specified concentrations of bacteria were inoculated in apple juice and irradiated at the designated UV doses of 0 to 15 mJ{middle dot}cm-2. In addition, UV irradiation doses ranging from 0 to 160 mJ{middle dot}cm-2 were also delivered to apple juice and polyphenols and vitamins were profiled. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted to assess the stability of polyphenols or vitamins in UV-C exposed apple juice. The polyphenol and vitamin results demonstrated that UV-C irradiation in apple juices at relevant commercial UV doses induced significant reductions in the concentrations of selected polyphenols and vitamins, p<0.05. Ascorbic acid was reduced to 32%, at 160 mJ/cm2 whereas 17% reduction was observed at 40 mJ/cm2. Riboflavin was observed to be relatively stable. Epicatechin and chlorogenic was significantly reduced at high exposure doses. In contrast minor changes were observed at 40 mJ/cm2. Results show that UV-C irradiation effectively inactivated pathogenic microbes in apple juice. The log reduction kinetics of microorganisms followed log-linear and with higher R2 (>0.95) and low RMSE values. The D10 values of 4.16 and 3.84 mJ{middle dot}cm-2 were obtained from the inactivation of Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes in apple juice. The results from this study imply that adequate log reduction of pathogens is achievable in apple juice and suggest significant potential for UV-C treatment of other liquid foods.",

    "abstract": "Comparable to the related Ebola virus, Marburg virus is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate. Therefore, handling of Ebola virus and Marburg virus is limited to biosafety level 4 facilities, of which only a limited number exists worldwide. However, researchers have developed several virus alternatives that are safe to handle in lower biosafety settings. One particularly interesting approach is the engineering of biologically contained Ebola virus by removing an essential gene from the virus genome and providing this missing gene in trans in a specific cell line. Because the virus is confined to this specific cell line, this results in a system that is safe to handle. So far, Ebola virus is the only virus for which biological containment has been reported. Here, we describe the first successful rescue of biologically contained Marburg virus and demonstrate that biological containment is also feasible for other filoviruses. Specifically, we describe the development of containment cell lines for Marburg virus through lentiviral transduction and show the growth and safety characteristics of eGFP-expressing, biologically contained Marburg virus in these cell lines. Additionally, we exploited this newly established Marburg virus system to screen over 500 compounds from available libraries. Lastly, we also validated the applicability of our biologically contained Marburg virus system in a 384-well format, to further illustrate the usefulness of this novel system as an alternative for high-throughput MARV screening of compound libraries.",

    "abstract": "Malaria-causing parasites achieve rapid proliferation in human blood through multiple rounds of asynchronous nuclear division followed by daughter cell formation. Nuclear divisions critically depend on the centriolar plaque, which organizes intranuclear spindle microtubules. The centriolar plaque consists of an extranuclear compartment, which is connected via a nuclear pore-like structure to a chromatin-free intranuclear compartment. Composition and function of this non-canonical centrosome remain largely elusive. Centrins, which reside in the extranuclear part, are among the very few centrosomal proteins conserved in Plasmodium falciparum. Here we identify a novel centrin-interacting centriolar plaque protein. Conditional knock down of this Sfi1-like protein (PfSlp) caused a growth delay in blood stages, which correlated with a reduced number of daughter cells. Surprisingly, intranuclear tubulin abundance was significantly increased, which raises the hypothesis that the centriolar plaque might be implicated in regulating tubulin levels. Disruption of microtubule homeostasis caused polymerization of excess microtubules and aberrant mitotic spindles. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that this prevented or delayed spindle extension. Our study thereby identifies a novel extranuclear centriolar plaque factor and establishes a functional link to the intranuclear compartment of this divergent eukaryotic centrosome.",

    "abstract": "Megakaryocytes (MKs) develop from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) after stimulation by the cytokine thrombopoietin (TPO). During megakaryopoiesis, MKs enlarge, undergo the process of endomitosis and develop intracellular membranes (the demarcation membrane system, DMS) which serve as a source for future platelets (PLTs). During DMS formation, there is an active transport from the Golgi apparatus to the DMS for the delivery of proteins, lipids, and membranes. The most important phosphoinositide that controls anterograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the PM is phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PI4P) controlled by the SACM1L phosphatase at the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The role of SACM1L and PI4P in megakaryopoiesis has not been investigated so far. Here we show that in primary mouse MKs, SACM1L is mostly localized and condensed perinuclearly in immature MKs, while at later stages it is mostly dispersed and confines to the ER. At the same time, PI4P is mostly found at the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane (PM) in immature MKs while in mature MKs it is in the periphery of the cell and at the PM. The exogenous expression of wild-type, but not C389S mutant (catalytically dead) SACM1L, results in the retention of the Golgi apparatus leading to the increased number of immature MKs, as well as a decreased number of MKs that form proplatelets. The inhibition of the production of PI4P specifically at the PM (inhibiting PI4-kinase III) resulted also in a significant decrease of MKs that form proplatelets. These results indicate that both Golgi and PM pools of PI4P mediate MK maturation and proplatelet formation.",

    "abstract": "Multiple endocytic processes operate in cells in tandem for the uptake of multiple cargoes, metabolites, and signaling molecules that are involved in diverse cellular functions including cell adhesion and migration. The best studied endocytic process involves the formation of a well-defined cytoplasmic coat at sites of uptake made of clathrin and its interacting partners. Galectin-3 (Gal3), an endogenous lectin, binds to glycosylated membrane receptors and glycosphingolipids (GSLs) to drive membrane bending, leading to the formation of tubular membrane invaginations which undergo scission to form a morphologically distinct class of uptake structures, termed clathrin-independent carriers (CLICs). This mechanism has been termed the GlycoLipid-Lectin (GL-Lect) hypothesis. Which components from cytoskeletal machinery are involved in the scission of CLICs remains yet to be explored. In this study, we propose that dynein, a retrograde motor protein, is recruited onto Gal3-induced tubular endocytic pits and provides the pulling force to for friction driven scission. Uptake of Gal3 and its cargoes (CD98/CD147) is significantly dependent on dynein activity, whereas the uptake of transferrin (a marker for clathrin-mediated endocytosis) is only slightly affected upon dynein inhibition. Dynein inhibition also affects cellular organelle distribution, 3D cell invasion and wound healing. Our study thereby reveals functions of dynein in individual and collective cell migration in 2D and 3D that are tightly coupled to endocytic processes in cells.",
