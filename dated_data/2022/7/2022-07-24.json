    "abstract": "In the study of molecular features like epigenetic marks, it is appealing to ascribe observed patterns to the action of natural selection. However, this conclusion requires a test for selection based on a well-defined notion of neutrality. Here, focusing on epigenetic marks at gene loci, we formalize what it means for an epigenetic mark to be neutral, and develop a test for selection. Our test respects the foundational aspect of epigenetics: trans-regulation by transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. It also enables adjustment for confounders. We establish that promoter DNA methylation, promoter H3K4me3 and exonic H3K36me3 are all under selection, and that this is unlikely to be a passive consequence of selection on gene expression. The effect of these epigenetic marks on fitness is arguably partly explained by a causal involvement in gene regulation. However, we also investigate the complementary explanation that DNA methylation and H3K36me3 are under selection in part because they modify the mutation rate of important genomic regions. We show that this explanation is consistent with empirical observations as well as population genetics theory, because of the trans-regulation. Exemplifying the protection of important regions from high mutability, we demonstrate that in humans the more intolerant to loss-of-function mutations a gene is, the lower its coding mutation rate is. Our framework for selection inference is simple but general, and we speculate that its core ideas will be useful for additional molecular features beyond epigenetic marks.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDuring visual development, response properties of layer 2/3 neurons in visual cortex are shaped by experience. Both visual and visuomotor experience are necessary to coordinate the integration of bottom-up visual input and top-down motor-related input. Whether visual and visuomotor experience engage different plasticity mechanisms, possibly associated with the two separate input pathways, is still unclear. To begin addressing this, we measured the expression level of three different immediate early genes (IEG) (c-fos, egr1 or Arc) and neuronal activity in layer 2/3 neurons of visual cortex before and after a mouses first visual exposure in life, and subsequent visuomotor learning. We found that expression levels of all three IEGs correlated positively with neuronal activity, but that first visual and first visuomotor exposure resulted in differential changes in IEG expression patterns. In addition, IEG expression levels differed depending on whether neurons exhibited primarily visually driven or motor-related activity. Neurons with strong motor-related activity preferentially expressed EGR1, while neurons that developed strong visually driven activity preferentially expressed Arc. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that bottom-up visual input and top-down motor-related input are associated with different IEG expression patterns and hence possibly also with different plasticity pathways.",

    "abstract": "The role of different cell types and their interactions in Alzheimers disease (AD) is an open question. Here we pursued it by assembling a high-resolution cellular map of the aging frontal cortex by single nucleus RNA-seq of 24 individuals with different clinicopathologic characteristics. We used the map to infer the neocortical cellular architecture of 638 individuals profiled by bulk RNA-seq, providing the sample size necessary for identifying statistically robust associations. We uncovered diverse cell populations associated with AD, including inhibitory neuronal subtypes and oligodendroglial states. We further recovered a network of multicellular communities, each composed of coordinated subpopulations of neuronal, glial and endothelial cells, and found that two of these communities are altered in AD. Finally, we used mediation analyses to prioritize cellular changes that might contribute to cognitive decline. Thus, our deconstruction of the aging neocortex provides a roadmap for evaluating the cellular microenvironments underlying AD and dementia.",

    "abstract": "Histone acetylation levels are reduced during mitosis. To study the mitotic regulation of H3K9ac we used an array of inhibitors targeting specific histone deacetylases. We evaluated the involvement of the targeted enzymes in regulating H3K9ac during all mitotic stages by immunofluorescence and immunoblots. We identified HDAC2, HDAC3 and SIRT1 as modulators of H3K9ac mitotic levels. HDAC2 inhibition increased H3K9ac levels in prophase, whereas HDAC3 or SIRT1 inhibition increased H3K9ac levels in metaphase. Next, we performed ChIP-seq on mitotic-arrested cells following targeted inhibition of these histone deacetylases. We found that both HDAC2 and HDAC3 have a similar impact on H3K9ac, and inhibiting either of these two HDACs substantially increases the levels of this histone acetylation in promoters, enhancers and insulators. Altogether, our results support a model in which H3K9 deacetylation is a stepwise process - at prophase HDAC2 modulates most transcription-associated H3K9ac-marked loci and at metaphase HDAC3 maintains the reduced acetylation, whereas SIRT1 potentially regulates H3K9ac by impacting HAT activity.\n\nSummary blurbCombination of immunofluorescence, western blot and ChIP-seq revealed the interplay between HDAC2, HDAC3 and SIRT1 in H3K9 deacetylation during mitosis of mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesUse of psychotropic substances in childhood has been associated with both impulsivity and other manifestations of poor executive function as well as escalation over time to use of progressively stronger substances. However, how this relationship may start in earlier childhood has not been well explored. Here, we investigated the neurobehavioral correlates of daily caffeinated soda consumption in preadolescent children and examined whether caffeinated soda intake is associated with a higher risk of subsequent alcohol initiation.\n\nMethodsUsing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study data, we first investigated cross-sectional relationships between frequent caffeinated soda intake and well-known risk factors of substance misuse: impaired working memory, high impulsivity, and aberrant reward processing. We then examined whether caffeinated soda intake at baseline predicts more alcohol sipping at 12 months follow-up using a machine learning algorithm.\n\nResultsDaily consumption of caffeinated soda was cross-sectionally associated with neurobehavioral risk factors for substance misuse such as higher impulsivity scores and lower working memory performance. Furthermore, caffeinated soda intake predicted greater alcohol sipping after 12 months even after controlling for rates of baseline alcohol sipping; children who drink caffeinated soda daily are twice as likely to start sipping alcohol after one year compared to those who do not drink caffeinated soda at all.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that previous linkages between caffeine and substance use in adolescence also extend to younger initiation, and may stem from core neurocognitive features thought conducive to substance initiation.",

    "abstract": "The predicted utility of information stored in working memory (WM) is hypothesized to influence the strategic allocation of WM resources. Prior work has shown that when information is prioritized, it is remembered with greater precision relative to other remembered items. However, these paradigms often complicate interpretation of the effects of predicted utility on item fidelity due to a concurrent memory load. Likewise, no fMRI studies have examined whether the predicted utility of an item modulates fidelity in the neural representation of items during the memory delay without a concurrent load. In the current study, we used fMRI to investigate whether predicted utility influences fidelity of WM representations in the brain. Using a generative model multivoxel analysis approach to estimate the quality of remembered representations across predicted utility conditions, we observed that items with greater predicted utility are maintained in memory with greater fidelity, even when they are the only item being maintained. Further, we found that this pattern follows a parametric relationship where more predicted utility corresponded to greater fidelity. These precision differences could not be accounted for based on a redistribution of resources among already-remembered items. Rather, we interpret these results in terms of a gating mechanism that allows for pre-allocation of resources based on predicted value alone. This evidence supports a theoretical distinction between resource allocation that occurs as a result of load and resource pre-allocation that occurs as a result of predicted utility.",

    "abstract": "Precise segmentation of infant brain MR images into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are essential for studying neuroanatomical hallmarks of early brain development. However, for 6-month-old infants, the extremely low-intensity contrast caused by inherent myelination hinders accurate tissue segmentation. Existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models for this task generally employ single-scale symmetric convolutions, which are inefficient for encoding the isointense tissue boundaries in baby brain images. Here, we propose a 3D mixed-scale asymmetric convolutional segmentation network (3D-MASNet) framework for brain MR images of 6-month-old infants. We replaced the traditional convolutional layer of an existing to-be-trained network with a 3D mixed-scale convolution block consisting of asymmetric kernels (MixACB) during the training phase and then equivalently converted it into the original network. Five canonical CNN segmentation models were evaluated using both T1- and T2-weighted images of 23 6-month-old infants from iSeg-2019 datasets, which contained manual labels as ground truth. MixACB significantly enhanced the average accuracy of all five models and obtained the most considerable improvement in the fully convolutional network model (CC-3D-FCN) and the highest performance in the Dense U-Net model. This approach further obtained Dice coefficient accuracies of 0.931, 0.912, and 0.961 in GM, WM, and CSF, respectively, ranking first among 30 teams on the validation dataset of the iSeg-2019 Grand Challenge. Thus, the proposed 3D-MASNet can improve the accuracy of existing CNNs-based segmentation models as a plug-and-play solution that offers a promising technique for future infant brain MRI studies.",

    "abstract": "Most human auditory psychophysics research has historically been conducted in carefully controlled environments with calibrated audio equipment, and over potentially hours of repetitive testing with expert listeners. Here, we operationally define such conditions as having high  auditory hygiene. From this perspective, conducting auditory psychophysical paradigms online presents a serious challenge, in that results may hinge on absolute sound presentation level, reliably estimated perceptual thresholds, low and controlled background noise levels, and sustained motivation and attention. We introduce a set of procedures that address these challenges and facilitate auditory hygiene for online auditory psychophysics. First, we establish a simple means of setting sound presentation levels. Across a set of four level-setting conditions conducted in person, we demonstrate the stability and robustness of this level setting procedure in open air and controlled settings. Second, we test participants tone-in-noise thresholds using widely adopted online experiment platforms and demonstrate that reliable threshold estimates can be derived online in approximately one minute of testing. Third, using these level and threshold setting procedures to establish participant-specific stimulus conditions, we show that an online implementation of the classic probe-signal paradigm can be used to demonstrate frequency-selective attention on an individual-participant basis, using a third of the trials used in recent in-lab experiments. Finally, we show how threshold and attentional measures relate to well-validated assays of online participants in-task motivation, fatigue, and confidence. This demonstrates the promise of online auditory psychophysics for addressing new auditory perception and neuroscience questions quickly, efficiently, and with more diverse samples. Code for the tests is publicly available through Pavlovia and Gorilla.",

Among heritable protein-coding genes, the prevalence of statistically significant ancestry-specific expression quantitative trait loci (anc-eQTLs) was 30% in African ancestry and 8% for Indigenous American ancestry segments. Most of the anc-eQTLs (89%) were driven by population differences in allele frequency, demonstrating the importance of measuring gene expression across multiple populations.

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is the primary analytical tool used to characterize proteins within the biopharmaceutical industry. Electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to liquid chromatography (LC) is the current gold standard for intact protein analysis. However, inherent speed limitations of LC/MS prevent analysis of large sample numbers (>1000) in a day. Infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (IR-MALDESI-MS), an ambient ionization MS technology, has recently been established as a platform for high throughput small molecule analysis. Here we report the applications of such a system for the analysis of intact proteins commonly performed within the drug discovery process. A wide molecular weight range of proteins 10 - 150 kDa was detected on the system with improved tolerance to salts and buffers compared to ESI. With high concentrations and model proteins, a sample rate up to 22 Hz was obtained. For proteins at low concentrations and in buffers used in commonly employed assays, robust data at a sample rate of 1.5 Hz was achieved, which is [~] 22x faster than current technologies used for high throughput ESI-MS-based protein assays. In addition, two multiplexed plate-based high throughput sample cleanup methods were coupled to IR-MALDESI-MS to enable analysis of samples containing excessive amounts of salts and buffers without fully compromising productivity. Example experiments, which leverage the speed of the IR-MALDESI-MS system to monitor NISTmAb reduction, protein autophosphorylation and compound binding kinetics in near real-time, are demonstrated.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467755v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afa091org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@56b6ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1034f83org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5949fb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The  gradient model of cortical organization proposes a close relationship between these areas and highly connected hubs in the default mode network, a set of cortical areas deactivated by demanding tasks. Here, we used a decision-making task and representational similarity analysis with classic  empathy for pain stimuli to probe the relationship between high-level representations of imminent pain in others and these areas. High-level representations were co-localized with task deactivations or the transitions from activations to deactivations. These loci belonged to two groups: those that loaded on the high end of the principal cortical gradient and were associated by meta-analytic decoding with the default mode network, and those that appeared to accompany functional repurposing of somatosensory cortex in the presence of visual stimuli. In contrast to the nonspecific meta-analytic decoding of these loci, low-level representations, such as those of body parts involved in pain or of pain itself, were decoded with matching topics terms. These findings suggest that task deactivations may set out cortical areas that host high-level representations. We anticipate that an increased understanding of the cortical correlates of high-level representations may improve neurobiological models of social interactions and psychopathology.",

We then evaluated the locations of both the individual-study peaks and the clusters against probabilistic functional atlases (cf. macroanatomy, as is typically done) for three candidate brain networks--the language-selective network (Fedorenko et al., 2011), which supports language processing, the Theory of Mind (ToM) network (Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003), which supports social inferences, and the domain-general Multiple-Demand (MD) network (Duncan, 2010), which supports executive control. These atlases were created by overlaying individual activation maps of participants who performed robust and extensively validated  localizer tasks that target each network in question (n=806 for language; n=198 for ToM; n=691 for MD). We found that both the individual-study peaks and the ALE clusters fell primarily within the language network and the ToM network. These results suggest that non-literal processing is supported by both i) mechanisms that process literal linguistic meaning, and ii) mechanisms that support general social inference. They thus undermine a strong divide between literal and non-literal aspects of language and challenge the claim that non-literal processing requires additional executive resources.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering individual cell phenotypes from cell-specific transcriptional processes requires high dimensional single cell RNA sequencing. However, current dimensionality reduction methods aggregate sparse gene information across cells, without directly measuring the relationships that exist between genes. By performing dimensionality reduction with respect to gene co-expression, low-dimensional features can model these gene-specific relationships and leverage shared signal to overcome sparsity. We describe GeneVector, a scalable framework for dimensionality reduction implemented as a vector space model using mutual information between gene expression. Unlike other methods, including principal component analysis and variational autoencoders, GeneVector uses latent space arithmetic in a lower dimensional gene embedding to identify transcriptional programs and classify cell types. In this work, we show in four single cell RNA-seq datasets that GeneVector was able to capture phenotypespecific pathways, perform batch effect correction, interactively annotate cell types, and identify pathway variation with treatment over time.",

    "abstract": "Suppressing actions is essential for flexible behavior. Multiple neural circuits involved in behavioral inhibition converge upon a key basal ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). To examine how changes in basal ganglia output contribute to self-restraint, we recorded SNr neurons during a proactive behavioral inhibition task. Rats responded to Go! cues with rapid leftward or rightward movements, but also prepared to cancel one of these movement directions on trials when a Stop! cue might occur. This action restraint - visible as direction-selective slowing of reaction times - altered both rates and patterns of SNr spiking. Overall firing rate was elevated before the Go! cue, and this effect was driven by a subpopulation of direction-selective SNr neurons. In neural state space, this corresponded to a shift away from the restrained movement. SNr neurons also showed more variable inter-spike-intervals during proactive inhibition. This corresponded to more variable state-space trajectories, which may slow reaction times via reduced preparation to move. These findings open new perspectives on how basal ganglia dynamics contribute to movement preparation and cognitive control.",

    "abstract": "The simultaneous conservation of species richness and evenness is important to effectively reduce biodiversity loss and keep ecosystem health. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has been used as a powerful tool for identifying community composition, but it does not necessarily provide quantitative information due to several methodological limitations. Thus, the quantification of eDNA through metabarcoding is an important frontier of eDNA-based biomonitoring. Particularly, the qMiSeq approach has recently been developed as a quantitative metabarcoding method and has attracted much attention due to its usefulness. The aim here was to evaluate the performance of the qMiSeq approach as a quantitative monitoring tool for fish communities by comparing the quantified eDNA concentrations with the results of fish capture surveys. The eDNA water sampling and the capture surveys using the electrical shocker were conducted at a total of 21 sites in four rivers in Japan. As a result, we found significant positive relationships between eDNA concentrations of each species quantified by qMiSeq and both the abundance and biomass of each captured taxon at each site. Furthermore, for seven out of eleven taxa, a significant positive relationship was observed between quantified DNA concentrations by sample and the abundance and/or biomass. In total, our results demonstrated that eDNA metabarcoding with the qMiSeq approach is a suitable and useful tool for quantitative monitoring of fish communities. Due to the simplicity of the eDNA analysis, the eDNA metabarcoding with qMiSeq approach would promote further growth of quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIeDNA analysis and capture surveys of fishes were conducted at a total of 21 sites.\nC_LIO_LIQuantitative eDNA metabarcoding (qMiSeq) successfully quantified the eDNA of fishes.\nC_LIO_LIFor each site, the estimated eDNA conc. reflected the abundance and biomass of fishes.\nC_LIO_LIFor each taxon, the estimated eDNA conc. were comparable among sites.\nC_LIO_LIqMiSeq is a suitable and useful tool for quantitative monitoring of fish community.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Malaria, spread by the female Anopheles mosquito, is a highly fatal disease widespread in many parts of the world, causing 0.4 million deaths globally. Vital gene expressions form the basis in the detection of malaria infection levels. Quantification of malaria parasite infected RBCs and classification of its life cycle stages are done at macroscopic level by experts, for making informed decisions. Off late multiple computational approaches have been proposed to circumvent the problem of dimensionality leading to accurate predicted results. In this work a dimensionality reduction technique based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied on P. falciparum single-cell transcriptomics to arrive at an optimized subset of features from the larger dataset. Features are chosen based on their class variants considering increased efficiency and accuracy, to separately transform the selected elements into a lower dimension. For the classification of the life cycle of malaria parasite based on single cell transcriptome data, a three-pronged approach employing the multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) techniques is used. Distribution of cells was visualised and mapped using the R-based Seurat package. Further, we constructed protein interaction networks of the genes identified by the feature selection method and elucidated the role of the proteins in progression of the parasite through its life cycle. Our approach presents a novel protocol to implement ML techniques on scRNA seq datasets and subsequently harnessing the extracted information for biomarker/drug target detection.",

With the probe 6-HoeHESiR, 3D superresolution imaging of in vitro reconstituted nucleosomal arrays and chromatin fibers yielded results consistent with EM analysis. Similar euchromatin and heterochromatin structures were visualized in fixed and live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution and labeling density, providing the first live-cell evidence for a hierarchical model of chromatin organization. 3D imaging results obtained in the presence of selective inhibitors of histone deacetylases also corroborate chromatin fiber decompaction upon hyperacetylation of histones.",

PRECAST unifies spatial factor analysis simultaneously with spatial clustering and embedding alignment, while requiring only partially shared cell/domain clusters across datasets.

    "abstract": "AimThe theory on trophic interactions between plants, insect herbivores, and their predators predicts that predators increase plant biomass by feeding on herbivores. However, it remains unclear whether different types of predators regulate herbivores to the same degree, and how the trophic interactions affect lower trophic levels along elevational gradients where predator communities differ significantly. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of vertebrate predators and ants (individually and in combination) on arthropod communities and leaf herbivory along a complete tropical forest gradient.\n\nLocationPapua New Guinea\n\nTaxonMulti-taxon\n\nMethodsWe excluded predators from 560 saplings in two six-month long predator exclusion experiments spanning wet and dry seasons. Saplings were spread across 8 study sites which were evenly spaced at 500 m elevational increments from 200 to 3700m a.s.l..\n\nResultsOn average the density of arthropods increased significantly by 37% and 33% respectively when vertebrate predators, and both ants and vertebrates predators, were removed. Both season and elevation mediated this effect significantly. At lower trophic levels, both the exclusion of both vertebrates alone, and exclusion of vertebrates plus ants, led to a significant increase in leaf damage by 50% and 36% respectively. In contrast, the exclusion of ants alone had no significant effect on arthropod density or leaf damage, which increased by 12% and 9% respectively.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results indicate that the relative contribution of birds and bats changes at different elevational sites, while the overall effect of vertebrate predators remains consistent along the whole elevational gradient. This contrasts with ant driven trophic cascades which brought about increased herbivory only at the most productive sites of the elevational gradient, where ant abundance is highest. We conclude that disappearance of insectivorous vertebrate predators can lead to substantial negative consequences for plants.",

It has been argued that the rapid neural transdifferentiation of BMDCs reported in culture studies is actually due to cytotoxic changes induced by the media. While transplantation studies indicated that BMDCs can form new neurons, it remains unclear whether the underlying mechanism is transdifferentiation or BMDCs-derived cell fusion with the existing neuronal cells. Cell fusion has been put forward to explain the presence of gene-marked binucleated neurons after gene-marked BMDCs transplantation. In the present study, we demostrated that human BMDCs can rapidly adopt a neural-like morphology through active neurite extension and binucleated human BMDCs can form with independence of any cell fusion events. We also showed that BMDCs neural transdifferentiation involves the formation of intermediate cells which can then redifferentiate into neural-like cells, redifferentiate back to the mesenchymal fate or even repeatedly switch lineages without cell division. Furthermore, we have discovered that nuclei from intermediate cells rapidly move within the cell, adopting different morphologies and even forming binucleated cells. Therefore, our results provide a stronger basis for rejecting the idea that BMDCs neural transdifferentiation is merely an artefact.",

    "abstract": "To recruit cases for late-onset disease study is challenging since these diseases occur in elder people. Moreover, typically we have a very limited number of late-onset disease cases in Biobank data. But, on the other hand, the parental disease status may be available by questionnaire. Because of this, methods have been developed to utilize parental disease status instead Liu et al. (2017); Hujoel et al. (2020). In these approaches, the late-onset phenotype of the participant is imputed from parental statuses. And, downstream, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is performed using the participants genotype and imputed phenotype. In this paper, we take another view on utilizing parental phenotypes. We treat this problem as missing parental genotype rather than missing participants phenotype. First, we propose an imputation scheme to infer the parental origin of the participants genotype from a collection of extra parental phenotypes (non-focal phenotypes) and the participants genotype. Second, we propose a computationally efficient approach to incorporate the imputed parental origin information into the downstream GWAS. We explore the feasibility of the proposed two-step approach on simulated and real data. And we derive the power increase of GWAS as a function of imputation quality. These results indicate that the imputation scheme needs about 100 non-focal phenotypes to achieve enough accuracy to facilitate the GWAS downstream.",

By studying a wide range of generative models in simulations, and by re-analyzing 25 well-studied quantitative phenotypes from 349,468 individuals in the UK Biobank and up to 159,095 individuals in BioBank Japan, we show that the inclusion of a cis-interaction score (i.e., interactions between a focal variant and nearby variants) significantly recovers substantial non-additive heritability that is not captured by LDSC. For each of the 25 traits analyzed in the UK Biobank and 23 of the 25 traits analyzed in BioBank Japan, i-LDSC detects a significant amount of variation contributed by genetic interactions. The i-LDSC software and its application to these biobanks represent a step towards resolving further genetic contributions of sources of non-additive genetic effects to complex trait variation.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often applied to the motor cortex to stimulate a collection of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in groups of peripheral muscles. The causal interface between TMS and MEP is the selective activation of the neurons in the motor cortex; moving the TMS  spot around over the motor cortex causes different MEP responses. A question of interest is whether a collection of MEP responses can be used to identify the stimulated locations on the cortex, which could potentially be used to then place the TMS coil to produce chosen sets of MEPs. In this work we leverage our previous report on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that predicted MEPs from the induced electric field, to tackle an inverse imaging task in which we start with the MEPs and estimate the stimulated regions on the motor cortex. We present and evaluate five different inverse imaging CNN architectures, both conventional and variational, in terms of several measures of reconstruction accuracy. We found that one architecture, which we denote as M2M-InvNet, consistently achieved the best performance.",

    "abstract": "The signal sequences of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) UL40 protein, and its rhesus CMV counterpart, Rh67, contain a peptide (VMAPRT[L/V][F/I/L/V]L, VL9) that can be presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigen E. The CMV VL9 peptides replace VL9 peptides derived from classical MHC (Ia) signal sequences, which are lost when CMV disrupts MHC Ia expression, as well as antigen processing and presentation. This allows infected cells to maintain surface expression of MHC-E and escape killing by NK cells expressing the inhibitory NKG2A/CD94 receptor. We demonstrate that processing of the Rh67 VL9 peptide mirrors that of UL40, despite the lack of sequence conservation elsewhere in the two proteins. As previously shown for UL40, up-regulation of MHC-E expression by Rh67 only requires its signal sequence, with sequences upstream of VL9 critical for conferring independence from TAP, the Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing. Additionally, we show that processing of both VL9 peptides depends on cleavage of the signal sequences by the host protease Signal Peptide Peptidase. Notably, our results also reveal that the mature UL40 and Rh67 proteins contribute to CMV immune evasion by down-regulating surface expression of MHC Ia. Unexpectedly, while the Rh67 VL9 peptide is resistant to the effects of the Rh67 protein, the UL40 protein is able to counteract up-regulation of MHC-E expression mediated by its own VL9 peptide. This suggests differences in the mechanisms by which the two VL9 peptides up-regulate MHC-E, which may have implications for translating a RhCMV-vectored SIV vaccine to HIV-1 using HCMV as a vector.\n\nIMPORTANCECell surface MHC-E expression, which requires a peptide (VMAPRT[L/V][F/I/L/V]L, \"VL9\") from the signal sequences of other MHC class I proteins, prevents cells from being killed by CD94/NKG2A-expressing Natural Killer cells. In cells infected with human CMV, the endogenous VL9 peptide is replaced by one from the signal sequence of the HCMV UL40 protein. We show that processing of the VL9 peptide of Rh67, the rhesus CMV equivalent of UL40, mirrors that of UL40, despite a lack of sequence homology between the two proteins. Of note, we also show that the mature UL40 and Rh67 proteins, which have no previously described function, contribute to CMV immune evasion by reducing classical MHC class I surface expression. Importantly, the mature UL40 protein, but not the mature Rh67 protein, can decrease the up-regulation of MHC-E mediated by its signal sequence VL9 peptide, which may have implications for HCMV as a vaccine vector.",

However, how known mechanisms of mechanosensing such as force dependent catch bonds and conformational changes in focal adhesion (FA) proteins can confer this sensitivity is not known. Using a combination of polarization microscopy and computational modeling, here we identify regulation of orientational order or molecular co-alignment of FA proteins as a mechanism able to precisely tune cell sensitivity to the ECM. We find that V integrins and F-actin in FAs show changes in orientational order in an ECM-mediated integrin activation dependent manner. This magnitude of orientational order is sensitive to changes in ECM density but independent of myosin-II activity though actomyosin contractility can further fine-tune it. A molecular clutch model for integrin binding ECM ligands demonstrates that orientational order of integrin-ECM binding and catch bonds tune cellular sensitivity to ECM density. This mechanism is also able to decouple ECM density changes from changes in ECM stiffness thus also contributing to specificity. Taken together, our results suggest relative geometric organization of FA components as an important regulator of mechanotransduction.",

Yet, the focus on recovery to equilibrium has prevented us from assessing species responses to perturbations when abundances fluctuate over time. Here, we introduce two data-driven approaches (expected sensitivity and eigenvector rankings) based on the time-varying Jacobian matrix to rank species over time according to their sensitivity to perturbations on abundances. Using several population dynamics models, we demonstrate that we can infer these rankings from time-series data to predict the order of species sensitivities. We find that the most sensitive species are not always the ones with the most rapidly changing or lowest abundance, which are typical criteria used to monitor populations. Finally, using two empirical time series, we show that sensitive species tend to be harder to forecast. Our results suggest that incorporating information on species interactions can improve how we manage communities out of equilibrium.",

GBA also causes the autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), Gaucher disease, and emerging evidence from human genetics implicates many other LSD genes in PD susceptibility. We have systemically tested 88 conserved fly homologs of 38 human LSD genes for requirements in the aging adult Drosophila brain and for potential genetic interactions with neurodegeneration caused by -synuclein (Syn), which forms Lewy body pathology in PD. Our screen identifies 15 genetic enhancers of Syn-induced progressive locomotor dysfunction, following knockdown of fly homologs of GBA and other LSD genes with independent support as PD susceptibility factors from human genetics (SCARB2, SMPD1, CTSD, GNPTAB, SLC17A5). For several genes, results from multiple alleles support dose-sensitivity and context-dependent pleiotropy in the presence or absence of Syn. Homologs of 2 genes causing cholesterol storage disorders, Npc1a / NPC1 and Lip4 / LIPA, were independently confirmed as loss-of-function enhancers of Syn-induced brain structural degeneration. The enzymes encoded by several modifier genes are upregulated in Syn transgenic flies, based on unbiased proteomics, revealing a possible compensatory response. Overall, our results reinforce the important role of lysosomal genes in brain health and PD pathogenesis, and implicate several metabolic pathways, including cholesterol homeostasis, in Syn-mediated neurodegeneration.",

Here, we report that addition of antibody and TRIM21 to Xenopus egg extracts promotes efficient degradation of endogenous target proteins, establishing cell-free Trim-Away as a powerful tool to interrogate protein function. Chemical methylation of TRIM21 had no effect on target proteolysis, whereas deletion of all lysine residues in targets abolished their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. These results demonstrate that target protein but not TRIM21 polyubiquitination is required for Trim-Away, and they suggest that current models of TRIM21 function should be fundamentally revised.",

    "abstract": "Engineered heart tissues have been created to study cardiac biology and disease in a setting that more closely mimics in-vivo heart muscle than 2D monolayer culture. Previously published studies suggest that geometrically anisotropic micro-environments are crucial for inducing \"in vivo-like\" physiology from immature cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that such anisotropic tissue geometries regulate tissue prestress, and that in turn this prestress is a major factor regulating cardiomyocytes electrophysiological development. Thus, we studied the effects of tissue geometry on electrophysiology of micro-heart muscle arrays (HM) engineered from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Geometries predicted to increase tissue prestress not only affected cardiomyocyte structure, but also had profound effects on electrophysiology.\n\nElongated geometries led to adaptations that yielded increased calcium intake during each contraction cycle. Strikingly, pharmacologic studies revealed a prestress threshold is required for sodium channel function, whereas L-type calcium and rapidly-rectifying potassium channels were largely insensitive. Analysis of RNA and protein levels suggest sodium channel activity changes were related to post-transcriptional, and potentially post-translational, changes. HM formed from Plakophilin 2 (PKP2) knockout iPSC had a cellular structure similar to isogenic controls.\n\nHowever, these tissues exhibited no functional sodium current and an overall lesser degree of electrical remodeling in response to prestress. These results suggest that PKP2, a key component of the nascent desmosome, is crucial to transducing tissue prestress into physiologically beneficial electrical remodeling via activation of sodium channels.",

When applied to FNC, these analyses assign samples to an optimal number of groups without a priori assumptions. Through these groupings, studies have provided insights into the dynamics of network connectivity through the identification of different brain states and have identified subgroups of individuals with unique brain activity. However, the manner in which underlying brain networks influence the identified groups is yet to be fully understood. In this study, we apply k-means clustering to resting-state fMRI-based static FNC data collected from 37,784 healthy individuals. We identified 2 groups of individuals with statistically significant differences in cognitive performance in several test metrics. Then, by applying two different versions of G2PC, a global permutation feature importance approach, and logistic regression with elastic net regularization, we were able to identify the relative importance of brain network pairs and their underlying features to the resulting groups. Through these approaches, together with the visualization of centroids connectivity matrices, we were able to explain the observed differences in cognition in terms of specific key brain networks. We expect that our results will shed further light upon the effect of underlying brain networks on encountered cognitive differences between groups with unique brain activity.",

However, most methods are computationally expensive lattice-embedded models which cannot simulate tumours with a realistic number of cells and rely on various simplifications. Alternatively, well-mixed stochastic models, while efficient and scalable, do not typically include spatial constraints and cannot reproduce the rich clonal dynamics observed in real-world tumours.\n\nResultsWe present SMITH, a simple, efficient, and explainable model of cancer evolution that combines the advantages of well-mixed stochastic models with a new confinement mechanism which limits the growth of clones based on the overall tumour size. We demonstrate that this confinement mechanism is sufficient to induce the rich clonal dynamics observed in spatial models, while allowing for a clear geometric interpretation and efficient simulation of one billion cells within a few minutes on a desktop PC. We explore the extent of stochasticity and rigorously assess the effects of cell turnover, mutation rate, fitness effects and confinement on the resulting clonal structures.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationSMITH is implemented in C# and freely available at bitbucket.org/schwarzlab/smith together with binaries for all major platforms.

This type of sensor reacts to light intensity changes rather than integrating photons during each frame exposure time. This makes it particularly suited to SMLM, where the ability to surpass the diffraction-limited resolution is provided by blinking events. Each pixel works independently and returns a signal only when an intensity change is detected. Since the output is a list containing only useful data rather than a series of frames, the temporal resolution is significantly better than typical scientific cameras. We demonstrate event-based SMLM super-resolution imaging on biological samples with spatial resolution on par with EMCCD or sCMOS performance.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcute injury to skeletal muscle damages myofibers and fragments capillaries, impairing contractile function and local perfusion. Myofibers and microvessels regenerate from satellite cells and from surviving microvessel fragments, respectively, to restore intact muscle. However, it is unknown whether myofiber regeneration and microvascular regeneration reflect interdependent processes or may proceed sequentially.\n\nMethodsTo investigate the temporal relationship between myogenesis and angiogenesis during regeneration, a punch biopsy (diameter, 2 mm) was performed through the center of the gluteus maximus (GM) muscle. Complete removal of all tissue components created a void into which regeneration was evaluated through 21 days post injury (dpi). Confocal imaging and histological analyses of whole-mount GM preparations and GM cross sections assessed the growth of microvessels and myofibers into the wound. Regeneration of perfused microvessels was evaluated in vivo by injecting fluorescent dextran into the circulation during intravital imaging.\n\nResultsA provisional matrix filled with PDGFR+ and CD45+ cells spanned the wound within 1 dpi. Regenerating microvessels advanced into the matrix by 7 dpi. At 10 dpi, sprouting and intussusceptive angiogenesis produced disorganized microvascular networks and spanned the wound with perfusion by 14 dpi. In striking contrast, the wound remained devoid of myofibers at 7 and 10 dpi. Myogenesis into the wound began by 14 dpi with nascent myofibers traversing the wound by 21 dpi. Regenerating myofibers and microvessels were less well organized than in the surrounding (uninjured) muscle.\n\nConclusionsAngiogenesis precedes myogenesis following punch biopsy injury of adult skeletal muscle. Regenerating microvessels encompass the wound and become perfused with blood prior to colocalization with regenerating myofibers. These findings infer that a microvascular supply supports the metabolic demands of regenerating skeletal muscle. Finding that regenerated microvascular networks and myofibers are disorganized within the biopsy site suggests that loss of guidance cues upon complete tissue removal impairs re-establishment of canonical skeletal muscle structure.",

There are four Neuroligins that operate at distinct synapse types, selectively interacting with presynaptic adhesion and postsynaptic scaffold proteins. We investigated the subcellular localization and scaffold specificities of synaptic Neuroligin-3 and demonstrate an unexpected pattern of localization to excitatory synapses in cortical areas, and inhibitory synapses in subcortical areas. Using phosphoproteomics, we identify Neuroligin-3-specific serine phosphorylation in cortex and hippocampus that obstructs a key binding site for inhibitory synapse scaffolds. Using in utero CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and replacement with phosphomimetic mutants, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at this site determines excitatory versus inhibitory synapse localization of Neuroligin-3 in vivo. Our data reveal a mechanism that differentially regulates the balance of Neuroligin-3 between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, adding to our emerging understanding of their role in the development of brain connectivity and associated pathologies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy targeting B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on multiple myeloma (MM) produces fast but not long-lasting responses. Reasons for treatment failure are poorly understood. CARs simultaneously targeting two antigens may represent an alternative. Here, we (1) designed and characterized novel A proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) based dual-antigen targeting CARs, and (2) investigated mechanisms of resistance to CAR T cells with three different BCMA-binding moieties (APRIL, single-chain-variable-fragment, heavy-chain-only).\n\nMethodsThree new APRIL-CARs were designed and characterized. Human APRIL-CAR T cells were evaluated for their cytotoxic function in vitro and in vivo, for their polyfunctionality, immune synapse formation, memory, exhaustion phenotype and tonic signaling activity. To investigate resistance mechanisms, we analyzed BCMA levels and cellular localization and quantified CAR T cell - target cell interactions by live microscopy. Impact on pathway activation and tumor cell proliferation was assessed in vitro and in vivo.\n\nResultsAPRIL-BB{zeta} CAR T cells in a trimeric ligand binding conformation conferred the best polyfunctionality, immune synapse formation and fast anti-tumor function in vivo in two different mouse xenograft models. Upon CAR T cell - myeloma cell contact, we found rapid BCMA downmodulation on target cells with all three evaluated binding moieties. CAR T cells acquired BCMA on their cell surface by trogocytosis, and BCMA on MM cells was rapidly internalized. Since trogocytosis can lead to CAR T cell exhaustion and presence of CAR T cells does not protect patients from relapse, we investigated whether non-functional CAR T cells play a role in tumor progression. While CAR T cell - MM cell interactions activated BCMA pathway, we did not find enhanced tumor growth in vitro or in vivo.\n\nConclusionWe designed and characterized distinct APRIL-CAR T cells for dual-antigen targeting of MM. Rapid BCMA downmodulation occurred upon CAR T cell - tumor cell encounter independently of whether an APRIL or antibody-based binding moiety was used. BCMA internalization mostly contributed to this effect, but trogocytosis by CAR T cells was also observed. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying CAR T cell failure in MM and can inform the development of improved treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "A complex microbial community in the gut generally prevent the colonization of enteric pathogens such as Salmonella. Because of the high complexity, several species or combination of species in the gut can confer colonization resistance. To gain a better understanding of the colonization resistance against Salmonella enterica, we isolated a library of 1,300 bacterial strains from feral chicken gut microbiota which represented a total of 51 species. Using a co-culture assay, we screened the representative species from this library and identified 30 species that inhibited Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. To improve the Salmonella inhibition capacity, from a pool of fast-growing species, we formulated 66 bacterial blends, each of which composed of 10 species. Bacterial blends were more efficient in inhibiting Salmonella as compared to individual species. The blend that showed maximum inhibition (Mix10) also inhibited other serotypes of Salmonella frequently found in poultry. The in vivo effect of Mix10 was examined in a gnotobiotic and conventional chicken model. The Mix10 consortium reduced Salmonella colonization, intestinal tissue damage and inflammation in both models. Cell free supernatant of Mix10 did not show Salmonella inhibition, indicating that Mix10 inhibits Salmonella through either nutritional competition or reinforcement of host immunity. Out of ten species, three species in Mix10 did not colonize while three species constituted more than 70% of the community. Two of these species represents previously uncultured bacteria. Our approach could be used as a high-throughput screening system to identify additional bacterial sub-communities that confer colonization resistance against enteric pathogens and its effect on the host.\n\nImportanceSalmonella colonization in chicken and human infections originating from Salmonella- contaminated poultry is a significant problem. Poultry has been identified as the most common food linked to enteric pathogen outbreaks in the United States. Since multi-drug resistant Salmonella often colonize chicken and cause human infections, methods to control Salmonella colonization in poultry are needed. The method we describe here could form the basis of developing gut microbiota-derived bacterial blends as a microbial ecosystem therapeutic against Salmonella.",

Although the main mechanism of stress-dependent induction of p53 protein relies on posttranslational modifications influencing its stability and activity, a growing number of evidences suggest that complex regulation of p53 expression occurs also at the mRNA level. This study explore structural determinants of long-range RNA-RNA interaction in p53 mRNA, crucial for stress-dependent regulation of p53 protein translation. We demonstrate that the eight nucleotide bulge motif plays a key structural role in base pairing of complementary sequences from the 5 and 3 untranslated regions of p53 mRNA. We also show that one of the p53 translation regulators, nucleolin, displays an RNA chaperone activity and facilitates the association of sequences involved in the formation of long-range interaction in p53 mRNA. Mutational analysis reveal that all four RNA recognition motifs are indispensable for optimal RNA chaperone activity of nucleolin. These observations help to decipher the unique mechanism of p53 protein translation regulation pointing bulge motif and nucleolin as the critical factors during intramolecular RNA-RNA recognition in p53 mRNA.",

The absence of an antiviral treatment or vaccine strategy against HMPV infection creates a high burden on the global health care system. Drug repurposing has become increasingly attractive for the treatment of emerging and endemic diseases as it requires less research and development costs than traditional drug discovery. In this study, we developed an in vitro medium-throughput screening assay that allows for the identification of novel anti-HMPV drugs candidates. Out of [~]2400 compounds, we identified eleven candidates with a dose-dependent inhibitory activity against HMPV infection. Additionally, we further described the mode of action of five anti-HMPV candidates with low in vitro cytotoxicity. Two entry inhibitors, Evans Blue and aurintricarboxylic acid, and three post-entry inhibitors, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil, and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, were identified. Among them, the mycophenolic acid series displayed the highest levels of inhibition, due to the blockade of intracellular guanosine synthesis. Importantly, MPA has significant potential for drug repurposing as inhibitory levels are achieved below the approved human oral dose. Our drug-repurposing strategy proved to be useful for the rapid discovery of novel hit candidates to treat HMPV infection and provide promising novel templates for drug design.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThere is currently no treatment against acute HMPV infection.\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a medium-throughput screening for drug repurposing against HMPV infection.\nC_LIO_LIEvaluation of a large drug library identified 5 candidates with low M to nM IC50 values against HMPV growth.\nC_LIO_LIThe approved drug mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a nM inhibitor of HMPV in vitro infection\nC_LIO_LIHuman MPA plasma levels upon oral dosing are 10x higher than MPA IC50 against HMPV in vitro infection.\nC_LI",

The light perception by the photoreceptors activate autotrophic photosynthetic metabolism to sustain growth of the whole plant. Several studies have evaluated transcriptional responses to light signals. Nevertheless, evaluating a single source experiment might bias the identificationof general, reproducible light responses. In order to identify widespread light-dependent signaling events that control early seedling photomorphogenesis we performed a survey comparing commonly regulated genes in transcriptomic public datasets derived from etiolated seedlings exposed to short light treatments. By compiling commonly regulated genes from different datasets, we obtained broadly representative regulated processes concerning general light transcriptional response. Our analysis shows that light primarly affects shoot gene expression promoting the assembly of photosynthetic machinery, signaling and redox responses. We observed that Transcriptograms allowed a better comparison among different experiments than DEseq analysis. We also identified that, transcriptional regulation of early light response is centered in the transcription factor ABA-Insensitive5 (ABI5) along with other bZIP transcription factors suggesting a mechanism by which dark expressed transcription factors guide the activation of early photomorphogenic genes.\n\nKey MessageComparative analisys of seedling deetiolation transcriptomic datasets identified ABA-responsive bZIP transcription factors as central regulators of early photomorphogenesis",

    "abstract": "Plants have developed an array of mechanisms to protect themselves against pathogen invasion. The deployment of defense mechanisms is imperative for plant survival, but can come at the expense of plant growth, leading to the \"growth- defense trade-off\" phenomenon. Following pathogen exposure, plants can develop resistance to further attack. This is known as induced resistance, or priming. Here, we investigated the growth-defense trade-off, examining how defense priming via Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), or Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR), affects tomato development and growth. We found that defense priming can promote, rather than inhibit, plant development, and that defense priming and growth tradeoffs can be uncoupled. Cytokinin response was activated during induced resistance, and found to be required for the observed growth and disease resistance resulting from ISR activation. ISR was found to have a stronger effect on plant development than SAR. Our results suggest that growth promotion and induced resistance can be co-dependent, and that in certain cases, defense priming can drive developmental processes and promote plant yield.\n\nSummary statementGrowth-defense tradeoffs in plants result in loss of yield. Here, we demonstrate that immunity priming in different pathways uncouples this tradeoff and allows for disease resistant plants with robust growth.",

Feeding C. elegans with ursolic acid (UA), a natural plant product, provides neuroprotection by enhancing maternal provisioning of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) - a bioactive sphingolipid. S1P promotes neuronal health across generations by upregulating transcription of the acid ceramidase-1 (asah-1) gene in the intestine. Intergenerational intestine-to-oocyte S1P transfer is essential for promoting neuronal health and is dependent on the lipoprotein yolk receptor RME-2 (Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis-2). Spatially regulating sphingolipid biosynthesis is critical, as inappropriate asah-1 neuronal expression causes developmental axon outgrowth defects.

P1(S) could transduce phagemid DNA into Shigella flexneri 2a 2457O, Shigella flexneri 5a M90T and Escherichia coli O3 efficiently. Mutational analysis of the O-antigen assembly genes and LPS inhibition assays indicated that P1(S) transduction requires at least one O-antigen unit. E. coli O111:B4 LPS produced a high neutralising effect against P1(S) transduction, indicating that this E. coli strain could be a host for P1(S). Mutations in the O-antigen modification genes of S. flexneri 2a 2457O and S. flexneri 5a M90T did not cause significant changes to P1(S) transduction efficiency.

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica is a common foodborne, facultative intracellular enteropathogen. Typhoidal S. enterica serovars like Paratyphi A (SPA) are human restricted and cause a severe systemic disease, while many S. enterica serovars like Typhimurium (STM) have broad host range, and in human hosts usually lead to self-limiting gastroenteritis. There are key differences between typhoidal and non-typhoidal Salmonella in pathogenesis, but underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Several genes encoding Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) effector proteins are absent or pseudogenes in SPA. Expression of virulence and metabolism genes show differential expression compared to STM. The intracellular transcriptomic architecture and phenotypes during presence in epithelial cells were recently described. Surprisingly, induction of motility, flagella and chemotaxis genes showed distinct expression patterns in intracellular SPA vs. STM and led to cytosolic motility of SPA. This study applies single cell microscopic analyses approaches to investigate the triggers and cellular consequences of cytosolic motility. Live cell imaging (LCI) revealed that SPA invades host cells in a highly cooperative manner. Extensive membrane ruffling at the invasion site leads to increased membrane damage in the nascent SCV with subsequent cytosolic release. After release into the cytosol, motile bacteria showed same velocity as under culture conditions used for infection. Reduced capture of SPA by autophagosomal membranes was observed by LCI and electron microscopy. Our results reveal flagella-mediated cytosolic motility as possible xenophagy evasion mechanism that could drive disease progression and contributes to dissemination of invasion-primed SPA during systemic infection.\n\nImportanceIntracellular pathogens are commonly adapted to life in host cells either in a pathogen-containing vacuole, or free in host cell cytosol. However, transitions between these lifestyles are possible and demand specific adaptations, especially to avoid recognition and killing by host cell-autonomous immune defense. Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A (SPA) belongs to typhoidal Salmonella able to cause live-threatening systemic infections in human hosts. We observed that SPA invades host cells in a way that often results in damage of the nascent vacuole and release of SPA in host cell cytosol. Here, SPA deploy flagella-mediated motility for rapid locomotion within infected cells. We demonstrate on single cell level that flagella-mediated motility enables evasion of xenophagic capture and control by the host cells. SPA uses a novel form of intracellular motility to successfully colonize human host cells.",

    "abstract": "Continuing advances in proteomics highlight the ubiquity and biological importance of proteoforms - the proteins with varied sequence, splicing, or distribution of post-translational modifications (PTMs). The preeminent example is histones, where the PTM pattern encodes the combinatorial language controlling the DNA transcription central to life. While the proteoforms with distinct PTM compositions are distinguishable by mass, the isomers with permuted PTMs (\"localization variants\") commonly coexisting in cells generally require separation before mass-spectrometric (MS) analyses. That was accomplished on the bottom-up and middle-down levels using chromatography or ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), but proteolytic digestion obliterates the crucial PTM connectivity information. Here we demonstrate baseline IMS resolution of intact isomeric proteoforms, specifically the acetylated H4 histones (11.3 kDa). The variants with a single acetyl moiety on five alternative lysine residues (K5, K8, K12, K16, K20) known for distinct functionalities in vivo were constructed by two-step native chemical ligation and separated using trapped IMS at the resolving power up to 350 on the Bruker TIMS/ToF platform. Full resolution for several pairs was confirmed using binary mixtures and by unique fragments in tandem MS employing collision-induced dissociation.

    "abstract": "It is now well-known that genetic mutations contribute to development of tumors, in which at least 15% of cancer patients experience a causative genetic abnormality including De Novo somatic point mutations. This highlights the importance of identifying responsible mutations and the associated biomarkers (e.g., genes) for early detection in high-risk cancer patients. The next-generation sequencing technologies have provided an excellent opportunity for researchers to study associations between De Novo somatic mutations and cancer progression by identifying cancer subtypes and subtype-specific biomarkers. Simple linear classification models have been used for somatic point mutation-based cancer classification (SMCC); however, because of cancer genetic heterogeneity (ranging from 50% to 80%), high data sparsity, and the small number of cancer samples, the simple linear classifiers resulted in poor cancer subtypes classification. In this study, we have evaluated three advanced deep neural network-based classifiers to find and optimized the best model for cancer subtyping. To address the above-mentioned complexity, we have used pre-processing clustered gene filtering (CGF) and indexed sparsity reduction (ISR), regularization methods, a Global-Max-Pooling layer, and an embedding layer. We have evaluated and optimized the three deep learning models CNN, LSTM, and a hybrid model of CNN+LSTM on publicly available TCGA-DeepGene dataset, a re-formulated subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and tested the performance measurement of these models is 10-fold-cross-validation accuracy. Evaluating all the three models using a same criterion on the test dataset revealed that the CNN, LSTM, and CNN+LSTM have 66.45% accuracy, 40.89% accuracy, and 41.20% accuracy in somatic point mutation-based cancer classification. Based on our results, we propose the CNN model for further experiments on cancer subtyping based on DNA mutations.",

    "abstract": "While most patients with triple negative breast cancer receive radiotherapy to improve outcomes, a significant subset of patients continue to experience recurrence. Macrophage infiltration into radiation-damaged sites has been shown to promote breast cancer recurrence in pre-clinical models. However, the mechanisms that drive recurrence are unknown. Here, we developed a novel spheroid model to evaluate macrophage-mediated tumor cell recruitment. We first characterized infiltrating macrophage phenotypes into irradiated mammary tissue to inform our model. We then established spheroids consisting of fibroblasts isolated from mouse mammary glands. We observed that tumor cell motility toward irradiated spheroids was enhanced in the presence of a 2:1 ratio of pro-healing:pro-inflammatory macrophages. We also measured a significant increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion after irradiation both in vivo and in our model. This secretion increased tumor cell invasiveness, and invasion was mitigated by neutralizing IL-6. Taken together, our work suggests that interactions between infiltrating macrophages and damaged stromal cells facilitates breast cancer recurrence through IL-6 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Patient-Derived Organoids (PDO) and Xenografts (PDX) are the current gold standards for patient derived models of cancer (PDMC). Nevertheless, how patient tumor cells evolve in these models and the impact on drug response remains unclear. Herein, we compared the transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility landscapes of six matched sets of colorectal cancer (CRC) PDO, PDX, PDO-derived PDX (PDOX), and original patient tumors (PT) and discovered two major remodeling axes. The first axis delineates PDX and PDO from PT, and the second axis distinguishes PDX and PDO. PDOX were more similar to PDX than they were to PDO, indicating that the growth environment is a driving force for chromatin adaptation. Using bivariate genomic footprinting analysis, we identified transcription factors (TF) that differentially bind to open chromatins between matched PDO and PDOX. Among them, KLF14 and EGR2 footprints were enriched in all six PDOX relative to matched PDO, and silencing of KLF14 or EGR2 promoted tumor growth. Furthermore, EPHA4, a shared downstream target gene of KLF14 and EGR2, altered tumor sensitivity to MEK inhibitor treatment. Altogether, patient-derived CRC cells undergo both common and distinct chromatin remodeling in PDO and PDX/PDOX, driven largely by their respective microenvironments, which results in differences in growth and drug sensitivity and needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting their ability to predict clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "During the process of translation the mRNAs in the cell \"compete\" for shared resources like tRNA molecules and ribosomes. This creates an indirect and intricate coupling between the mRNAs. For example, if ribosomal \"traffic jams\" evolve on some mRNA then the abundance of free ribosomes may decrease leading to lower initiation rates in the other mRNAs. When the shared resources are abundant the coupling between mRNAs due to this competition is weak. However, when the resources are scarce, e.g., when the pool of free ribosomes is starved, the competition may have a dramatic effect on the dynamics of translation in the cell. This scenario may be relevant for example under stress conditions or during a high yield viral infection, where the viral mRNAs \"hijack\" components of the translation machinery. Fierce competition for shared resources may also take place in synthetic or engineered systems such as cell free systems or in the case of high-throughput heteroglougs gene expression.\n\nWe study this scenario using a mathematical model that includes a network of m ribosome flow models (RFMs) interconnected via a pool of free ribosomes. Each RFM is a non-linear dynamical model for ribosome flow along a single mRNA molecule, and the interconnection via the pool encapsulates the competition for shared resources. We analyze the case where m is large, i.e., a there is a large number of mRNAs. This implies that many ribosomes are attached to the mRNAs and thus the pool is starved.\n\nOur model allows quantitative and qualitative analysis of the network steady state when the pool is starved. Our analysis results show that adding an mRNA to the network always decreases the steady state pool density. This makes sense, as every new mRNA \"consumes\" ribosomes. We also show that adding an mRNA has an intricate effect on the total protein production in the network: on the one-hand, the new mRNA produces new proteins. On the other-hand, the other mRNAs produce less proteins, as the pool that feeds these mRNAs now has a smaller abundance of ribosomes. Our analysis yields an explicit bound for the total production rate of the network when the number of RFMIOs is very large. In particular, we analyze how the total density of ribosomes in the network bounds the total production rate. This bound demonstrates that when the number of mRNAs increases, the marginal utility of adding another mRNA diminishes, and the total protein production rate saturates to a limiting value. We demonstrate our analysis approach using an example of producing insulin in a cell free system.",

Here using behavioral, immunohistochemical, electrophysiological and computational approaches, we describe the structural plasticity of AIS in rats superficial spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) neurons, which underlies inflammatory pain. We show an inflammation-mediated distal shift of the AIS away from the soma in inhibitory but not excitatory SDH neurons, concomitant with the peak of inflammatory pain. This AIS translocation was accompanied by a decrease in excitability of the inhibitory neurons. Following recovery from inflammatory hyperalgesia, the AIS location and neuronal excitability reversed to baseline levels. The computational model of SDH inhibitory neurons predicts that the distal shift of AIS is sufficient to decrease the intrinsic excitability of these neurons. Our results provide evidence of differential inflammation-mediated AIS plasticity, reducing the excitability of inhibitory but not excitatory SDH neurons and contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia.",

    "abstract": "Maladaptive processing of trauma related memory engrams leads to dysregulated fear reactions. In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dysfunctional extinction learning prevents discretization of trauma-related memory engrams and leads to generalized fear responses. PTSD is postulated as a mnemonic-based disorder, but we lack markers or treatments targeting pathological fear memory processing. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) and concurrent neocortical oscillations are scaffolds to consolidate contextual memory, but their role during fear processing remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that closed-loop SWRs triggered neuromodulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) can enhance the consolidation of fear extinction. It modified fear memories that became resistant to induced recall (i.e.,  renewal and  reinstatement) and did not reemerge spontaneously as a PTSD-like phenotype. The effects are mediated by D2 receptor signaling induced synaptic remodeling in the basolateral amygdala. These results suggest that SWRs help consolidating fear extinction memories. Furthermore, enhancing the consolidation of extinction engrams by SWR-triggered induction of reward signals can alleviate pathologic fear reactions in a rodent model of PSTD. No adverse effects were seen, suggesting this potential therapy for PTSD and anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Consecutive glycosylation sites occur in both self and viral proteins. Glycan-shielding of underneath peptide region is a double-edged sword, that avoids immune attack to self-proteins, but helps viruses including HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2 to escape antibody binding. Here we report a high-affinity antibody, 16A, binding to linear peptide containing consecutive glycosylation sites. Co-crystallization of 16A Fab and glycopeptides with GalNAc modifications at different sites showed that STAPPAHG is the sequence recognized by 16A antibody. GalNAc modification at Threonine site on STAPPAHG sequence significantly increased the affinity of Fab binding by 30.6 fold (KD=6.7nM). The increased affinity is conferred by hydrophilic and pi-stacking interactions between the GalNAc residue on Threonine site and a Trp residue from the CDR1 region of the heavy chain. Furthermore, molecular modeling suggested that GalNAc on T site causes more favorable conformation for antibody binding. These results showed that glycan modification most proximal to linear peptide core epitope significantly increases antigenicity of a glycopeptide epitope. The antibody recognition mode by peptide-binding CDR groove with a glycan-binding edge, may shed light on designing of linear glycopeptide-based vaccines for cancer and viral diseases.\n\nTeaserA high-affinity antibody was found to bind densely glycosylated glycoprotein region by a peptide binding groove of the antibodys variant region, with a glycan-binding edge specific to glycosylation site most proximal to core peptide epitope.",

    "abstract": "The formation of Gasdermin (GSDM) pores, leading to pyroptosis or other context-dependent consequences, is directly involved in multiple diseases. Gasdermin-B (GSDMB) plays complex and controversial roles in pathologies, with pyroptosis-dependent and independent functions. GSDMB is promising oncologic therapeutic target since it exhibits either antitumor function, when immunocyte-mediated Granzyme-A (GZMA) cleaves GSDMB releasing its cytotoxic N-terminal domain, or pro-tumoral activities (invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance). However, it is still unknown the precise regulatory mechanisms of GSDMB pyroptosis as well as the differential effects of the four translated GSDMB variants (GSDMB1-4, that differ in the alternative usage of exons 6-7) in this process. Here, we first prove that exon 6 translation (in the interdomain protein linker) is essential for pyroptosis, and therefore, GSDMB isoforms lacking this exon (GSDMB1-2) cannot provoke cancer cell death. Consistently, in large series of breast cancer samples GSDMB2 expression, and not of exon6-containing variants (GSDMB3-4), associates with unfavourable clinical-pathological parameters. Moreover, cellular, and biochemical analyses combined with confocal, live cell imaging, and electron microscopy studies, demonstrated that diverse GSDMB N-terminal constructs containing exon-6 induce mitochondrial damage (increased mitochondrial ROS, membrane potential loss and mitochondrial DNA release) together with pyroptotic membrane cell lysis. While exon-6 residues are not required for membrane or mitochondrial localization, we also identified other key residues for N-terminal domain cytotoxicity. Additionally, we demonstrated that all GSDMB variants share the cleavage sites for GZMA, Neutrophil Elastase (identified in this study) and caspases. Interestingly, whereas Neutrophil Elastase and caspases produce N-terminal fragments in all GSDMB isoforms with no pyroptotic activity, thus acting as a potential inhibitory mechanism, GZMA cleavage activates pyroptosis in an isoform-dependent way. Summarizing, our results have important implications for understanding the complex roles of GSDMB isoforms in cancer and other pathologies and for the future design of GSDMB-targeted therapies.",

Using a genome-wide CRISPR-dCas9 transactivation screen we identified two Bcl-2 family proteins, BNIP5 and Bcl-G, as inhibitors of Bak, but not Bax induced apoptosis. BNIP5 was able to block Bak activation in different cell types and in response to various cytotoxic therapies. The BH3 domain of BNIP5 was both necessary and sufficient to block Bak activation. Mechanistically, the BH3 domains of BNIP5 and Bcl-G act as a selective Bak activators, while not inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins.

    "abstract": "Widespread repression of protein synthesis rates is a key feature of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, mediated by the ER sensor kinase PERK. While select transcripts escape this repression, global translational down-regulation impacts crucial protein levels in all cellular compartments, beyond the ER. How the cell manages this paradox is unclear. PERK has a unique cytoplasmic loop within its kinase domain that binds PERKs target, eIF2. We identified the mitochondrial protein, ATAD3A, as a new interactor of the loop, binding to a highly conserved region within it. During ER stress, increased interaction between ATAD3A and PERK attenuates PERK signalling to eIF2, removing the translational block on several mitochondrial proteins. This occurs at novel context-dependent, mitochondria-ER contact sites. The interaction provides a previously unknown mechanism for fine-tuning translational repression at a local level, mitigating the impact of ER stress on mitochondria. Further, it represents a new target for selective modulation of PERK-eIF2 signalling in diseases from cancer to neurodegeneration.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/501280v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f74252org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1234633org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5dc9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8606fe_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Molecular analyses, however, have revealed closer genetic proximity of the lithodoid crabs to the family Paguridae than to other families of Paguroidea, provoking a long debate. We investigated the length and nucleotide sequence variation of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) in lithodoid and paguroid species. Uniquely short ITS1s (215-253 bp) were observed in seven lithodoid species belonging to the families Lithodidae and Hapalogastridae. In contrast, ITS1 length varied considerably in 13 paguroid species belonging to the families Coenobitidae, Diogenidae, and Paguridae. Short-to-long ITS1s (238-1090 bp) were observed in five species of the family Paguridae, and medium to long ITS1s (573-1166 bp) were observed in eight species of the families Coenobitidae and Diogenidae. Interestingly, ITS1s of considerably different sizes coexist in individual paguroid species. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the short ITS1s observed in the family Paguridae were descendants of longer ITS1s and were homologous to the short ITS1 of lithodoid species. ITS1 sequences of the families Coenobitidae and Diogenidae shared no nucleotide elements similar to those of lithodoid and pagurid species. These molecular signals indicate that the short ITS1 in pagurid lineage was passed on to lithodoid lineage, strongly supporting the \"hermit-to-king\" crab hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has been linked to health consequences throughout life, from early life illnesses (e.g. sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis) to lifelong chronic conditions such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease. It has also been observed that events in early life can lead to shifts in the microbiota, with some of these changes having been documented to persist into adulthood.\n\nA particularly extreme example of a divergent early GI microbiota occurs in premature neonates, who display a very different GI community to term infants. Certain characteristic patterns have been associated with negative health outcomes during the neonatal period, and these patterns may prove to have continual damaging effects if not resolved.\n\nResultsIn this study we contrast a set of premature infants with a paired set of term infants (n=37 pairs) at six weeks of life and at two years. In the samples taken at six weeks we find microbial communities differing in both diversity and specific bacterial groups between the two infant cohorts. We identify clinical factors associated with over-abundance of potentially pathogenic organisms (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae) and reduced abundances of some beneficial organisms (e.g. Bifidobacterium).\n\nWe contrast these findings with samples taken at two years of age, which show that despite a very different initial microbiota, the two infant groups converge to a similar, more adult-like state. We identify clinical factors, including both prematurity and delivery method, that remain associated with components of the microbiota. Both clinical factors and microbial characteristics are compared to the occurrence of childhood wheeze and eczema, revealing associations between components of the GI microbiota and the development of these allergic conditions.\n\nConclusionsThe faecal microbiota differs greatly between infants born at term and those born prematurely during early life, yet it converges over time. Despite this, early clinical factors remain significantly associated with the abundance of some bacterial groups at two years of age. Given the associations made between health conditions and the microbiota, factors that alter the makeup of the gut microbiota, and potentially its trajectory through life, could have important lifelong consequences.",

    "abstract": "Marine protists are major components of the oceanic microbiome that remain largely unrepresented in culture collections and genomic reference databases. The exploration of this uncharted protist diversity in oceanic communities relies essentially on studying genetic markers from the environment as taxonomic barcodes. Here we report that across 6 large scale spatio-temporal planktonic surveys, half of the genetic barcodes remain taxonomically unassigned at the genus level, preventing a fine ecological understanding for numerous protist lineages. Among them, parasitic Syndiniales (Dinoflagellata) appear as the least described protist group. We have developed a computational workflow, integrating diverse 18S rDNA gene metabarcoding datasets, in order to infer large-scale ecological patterns at 100% similarity of the genetic marker, overcoming the limitation of taxonomic assignment. From a spatial perspective, we identified 2 171 unassigned clusters exclusively shared between the Tropical/Subtropical Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea among all Syndiniales orders and 25 ubiquitous clusters shared within all the studied marine regions. From a temporal perspective, over 3 time-series, we highlighted 38 unassigned clusters that follow rhythmic patterns of recurrence and are the best indicators of parasite communitys variation. These clusters withhold potential as ecosystem change indicators, mirroring their associated host community responses. Our results underline the importance of Syndiniales in structuring planktonic communities through space and time, raising questions regarding host-parasite association specificity and the trophic mode of persistent Syndiniales, while providing an innovative framework for prioritizing unassigned protist taxa for further description.",

    "abstract": "Organoids bearing human stem cell-derived progenitors enable basic and applied investigation of organogenesis in a wide range of epithelial tissues. During liver organogenesis (LO), E9.5 collectively migrating hepatoblasts (MHs) arise from the E9.0 liver diverticulum (LD) and directly penetrate the surrounding mesoderm (MES) tissue, forming cell strands that link migration, differentiation, and growth. Currently, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) organoid protocols model the E10.5 liver bud and forward differentiation, but not the LD or the LD-derived MHs, in spite of their significance. In fact, the transcriptome underlying MHs, the niche that drives their migration, and methods to induce them from hPSC remain key questions.\n\nWe performed bioinformatics analysis of single cell RNA-seq data, in vivo transplantation, and in vitro hPSC differentiation with organoid formation, microscopy, gene and protein expression, small molecule inhibitor screening of growth, and organoid culture in bioengineered devices to assess tissue tension.\n\nOur in depth bioinformatic analysis of early murine LO demonstrates pathway up-regulation of an unexpected wide array of soluble signaling factors, as well as cell cycle, chromatin modification, and metabolic reprogramming, in addition to a widespread cell stress-response. These findings led us hypothesize that the LD and MES tissue form a tissue complex (LD-MESC) that drives MH induction. Using this LD-MESC concept, we designed an in vivo transplant system, as well as a three-step in vitro protocol for inducing hPSC-derived MHs, both of which recapitulate liver growth, morphogenesis, differentiation. We show that Hippo signaling pathway, in agreement with murine MH data, mediates migration and growth of hPSC-MH in vitro. These data substantiate the LD-MESC model developed here, and directly address key challenges facing liver regenerative medicine.\n\nOur bioinformatics, in vitro, and in vivo data all support the concept that the LD-MESC initiates LO. This concept can be used to change protocols to emphasize linking of migration, growth, with differentiation. Modeling epithelial collective migration for LO bolsters not only organogenesis studies of alternate endodermal organs, but also in vivo transplantation efforts, and facilitates employing migrating organoids to therapeutically target human tumor migration/metastasis.",

However, bacterial genomes constantly evolve, with mutations accumulated in the genomes over time. It is thus unclear whether the previously identified known bacterial strains are still helpful or even valid for understanding a current shotgun metagenomic sample. To address this question, here we revisited the known strains of the bacterial species S. aureus and S. epidermis identified in 68 atopic dermatitis shotgun metagenomic samples. We find that even the same tools cannot predict the previously reported known strains on the same samples, and most known strains identified by different tools are different. Moreover, the coverage in the pooled and individual samples supports none of the inferred known strain. Our study thus indicates the limitation of the known-strain-based studies, especially those on rapidly evolving bacterial species. Our study also called for de novo bacterial strain identification directly from shotgun metagenomic reads.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technique to study in situ gene expression patterns at the whole-genome scale. In addition to transcriptomic data, the technique usually generates matched histopathological images for the same tissue sample. ST data analysis is complicated by severe technical noise; matched histopathological images with high spatial continuity and resolution introduce complementary cellular phenotypical information and provide a chance to mitigate the noise in ST data. Hence, we propose a novel ST data analysis method called transcriptome and histopathological image integrative analysis for spatial transcriptomics (TIST), which integrates the information from sequencing-based ST data and histopathological images. TIST uses a Markov random field (MRF) model to learn the macroscopic cellular features from histopathological images and devises a random-walk-based strategy to integrate the extracted image features, the transcriptomic features and the location information for spatial cluster (SC) identification and gene expression enhancement. We tested TIST both on simulated datasets and on 33 real datasets; we found that TIST achieved superior performance on multiple tasks, which illustrates the utility of this method in facilitating the discovery of biological insights from sequencing-based ST data.",

    "abstract": "The development of targeted drugs allows precision medicine in cancer treatment and achieving optimal targeted therapies. Accurate identification of cancer drug genes is helpful to strengthen the understanding of targeted cancer therapy and promote precise cancer treatment. However, rare cancer-druggable genes have been found due to the multi-omics datas diversity and complexity. This study proposes DF-CAGE, a novel machine learning-based method for cancer-druggable gene discovery. DF-CAGE integrated the somatic mutations, copy number variants, DNA methylation, and RNA-Seq data across ~10000 TCGA profiles to identify the landscape of the cancer-druggable genes. We found that DF-CAGE discovers the commonalities of currently known cancer-druggable genes from the perspective of multi-omics data and achieved excellent performance on OncoKB, Target, and Drugbank data sets. Among the ~20,000 protein-coding genes, DF-CAGE pinpointed 465 potential cancer-druggable genes. We found that the candidate cancer druggable genes (CDG-genes) are clinically meaningful and can be divided into highly reliable, reliable, and potential gene sets. Finally, we analyzed the contribution of the omics data to the identification of druggable genes. We found that DF-CAGE reports druggable genes mainly based on the CNAs data, the gene rearrangements, and the mutation rates in the population. These findings may enlighten the study and development of new drugs in the future.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue in biology is the nature of evolutionary transitions from unicellular to multicellular organisms. Volvocine algae are models for this transition, as they span from the unicellular biflagellate Chlamydomonas to multicellular species of Volvox with up to 50,000 Chlamydomonas-like cells on the surface of a spherical extracellular matrix. The mechanism of phototaxis in these species is of particular interest since they lack a nervous system and intercellular connections; steering is a consequence of the response of individual cells to light. Studies of Volvox and Gonium, a 16-cell organism with a plate-like structure, have shown that the flagellar response to changing illumination of the cellular photosensor is adaptive, with a recovery time tuned to the rotation period of the colony around its primary axis. Here, combining high-resolution studies of the flagellar photoresponse with 3D tracking of freely-swimming cells, we show that such tuning also underlies phototaxis of Chlamydomonas. A mathematical model is developed based on the rotations around an axis perpendicular to the flagellar beat plane that occur through the adaptive response to oscillating light levels as the organism spins. Exploiting a separation of time scales between the flagellar photoresponse and phototurning, we develop an equation of motion that accurately describes the observed photoalignment. In showing that the adaptive time scale is tuned to the organisms rotational period across three orders of magnitude in cell number, our results suggest a unified picture of phototaxis in green algae in which the asymmetry in torques that produce phototurns arise from the individual flagella of Chlamydomonas, the flagellated edges of Gonium and the flagellated hemispheres of Volvox.",

Here, we developed a multi-omics data integration strategy called MOBILE (Multi-Omics Binary Integration via Lasso Ensembles) to nominate molecular features associated with specific cellular phenotypes. We applied this method to chromatin accessibility, mRNA, protein, and phospho-protein time course datasets and focus on two illustrative use cases after we show MOBILE could recover known biology. First, MOBILE nominated new mechanisms of interferon-{gamma} (IFN{gamma}) regulated PD-L1 expression, where analyses suggested, and literature supported that IFN{gamma}-controlled PD-L1 expression involves BST2, CLIC2, FAM83D, ACSL5, and HIST2H2AA3 genes. Second, we explored differences between the highly similar transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF{beta}1) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and showed that differential cell size and clustering properties induced by TGF{beta}1, but not BMP2, were related to the laminin/collagen pathway activity.

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a stage of development characterized by neurodevelopmental specialization of cognitive processes. In particular, working memory continues to improve through adolescence, with increases in response accuracy and decreases in response latency continuing well into the twenties. Human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate that gamma oscillations (35-65 Hz) during the working memory delay period support the maintenance of mnemonic information guiding subsequent goal-driven behavior, which decrease in power with development. Importantly, recent electrophysiological studies have shown that gamma events, more so than sustained activity, may underlie working memory maintenance during the delay period. However, developmental differences in gamma events during working memory have not been studied. Here, we used EEG in conjunction with a novel spectral event processing approach to investigate age-related differences in transient gamma band activity during a memory guided saccade (MGS) task in 164 10- to 30-year-olds. Total gamma power was found to significantly decrease through adolescence, replicating prior findings. Results from the spectral event pipeline showed age-related decreases in the mean power of gamma events and trial-by-trial power variability across both the delay period and fixation epochs of the MGS task. In addition, we found that while event number decreased with age during the fixation period, it did not appear to change during the delay period resulting in an increasing difference between the number of events during fixation and delay period with development, suggesting that as working memory develops there is greater specificity for gamma events supporting working memory. While average power of the transient gamma events was found to mediate age-related changes in total gamma power, the number of gamma events was unrelated to total power, suggesting that the power of gamma events may underlie the sustained gamma activity seen in EEG literature while the number of events may directly support age-related improvements in working memory maintenance. Our findings provide compelling new evidence for mechanistic changes in neural processing characterized by refinements in neural function as behavior becomes optimized in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing of somatic cells via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) offers promise for new therapeutics to treat a variety of genetic disorders, including neurological diseases. However, the dense and complex parenchyma of the brain and the post-mitotic state of neurons make efficient genome editing challenging. In vivo delivery systems for CRISPR-Cas proteins and single guide RNA (sgRNA) include both viral vectors and non-viral strategies, each presenting different advantages and disadvantages for clinical application. We developed non-viral and biodegradable PEGylated nanocapsules (NCs) that deliver preassembled Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Here, we show that the RNP NCs led to robust genome editing in neurons following intracerebral injection into the mouse striatum. Genome editing was predominantly observed in medium spiny neurons (>80%), with occasional editing in cholinergic, calretinin, and parvalbumin interneurons. Glial activation was minimal and was localized along the needle tract. Our results demonstrate that the RNP NCs are capable of safe and efficient neuronal genome editing in vivo.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTModifying the DNA of cells in the brain could present opportunities for new treatments of neurological diseases. In this report, we describe a nanocapsule system designed to deliver the elements needed to modify the DNA of brain cells, also known as genome editing.

    "abstract": "Illusions are a powerful tool for studying the single neuron correlates of perception. Here, we introduce the neon color spreading (NCS) illusion in mice and report the neuronal correlates of illusory brightness, which has heretofore only been studied using human fMRI. We designed a novel NCS paradigm to evoke the percept of an illusory drifting grating and analyzed the activity of 520 single units in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). A substantial proportion of V1 single units (60.5%) responded to illusory gratings with direction tuning matched to their preferred direction, which was determined using physically presented luminance-defined gratings (LDG). Moreover, by presenting LDG gratings with a 180{degrees} phase shift relative to NCs gratings, we show that spatial phase tuning shifted 180{degrees} for most single units. This finding conclusively demonstrates that V1 single units respond to illusory brightness. Using this novel mouse paradigm, we show that responses to illusory gratings have a lower magnitude and are delayed relative to physical gratings. We determined where V1 single units fell in the V1 cellular hierarchy (based on their susceptibility to surround suppression, their putative classification as interneuron or pyramidal neuron, and designation as a simple or complex cell) and found that higher-level V1 single units are more responsive to NCS stimuli. These findings resolve the debate of whether V1 is involved in illusory brightness processing and reveal a V1 hierarchical organization in which higher-level neurons are pivotal to the processing of illusory qualities, such as brightness.",

    "abstract": "Rewiring of transcriptional regulatory networks has been implicated in many biological and pathological processes. However, most current methods for detecting rewiring events (differential network connectivity) are not optimized for miRNA-mediated gene regulation and fail to systematically examine predicted target genes in study designs with multiple experimental or phenotypic groups. We developed a novel method to address these shortcomings. The method first estimates miRNA-gene expression correlations with Spatial Quantile Normalization to remove the mean-correlation relationship. Then, for each miRNA, genes are ranked by their correlation strength per experimental group. Enrichment patterns of predicted target genes are compared using the Anderson-Darling test and significance levels are estimated via permutation. Finally, context-specific target genes for each miRNA are identified with target prioritization based on the correlation strength between miRNA and predicted target genes within each group. In miR-155 KO RNA-seq data from four mice immune cell types, our method captures the known cell-specific regulatory differences of miR-155, and prioritized targets are involved in functional pathways with cell-type specificity. Moreover, in TCGA BRCA data, our method identified subtype-specific targets that were uniquely altered by miRNA perturbations in cell lines of the same subtype. Our work provides a new approach to characterize miRNA-mediated gene regulatory network rewiring across multiple groups from transcriptomic profiles. The method may offer novel insights into cell-type and cancer subtype-specific miRNA regulatory roles.",

    "abstract": "The directed migration of cellular clusters enables morphogenesis, wound healing, and collective cancer invasion. Gradients of substrate stiffness are known to direct the migration of cellular clusters in a process called collective durotaxis, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we unveil a connection between collective durotaxis and the wetting properties of cellular clusters. We show that clusters of cancer cells dewet soft substrates and wet stiff ones. At intermediate stiffness, at the crossover from low to high wettability, clusters on uniform-stiffness substrates become maximally motile, and clusters on stiffness gradients exhibit optimal durotaxis. Durotactic velocity increases with cluster size, stiffness gradient, and actomyosin activity. We demonstrate this behavior on substrates coated with the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin and then establish its generality on substrates coated with extracellular matrix. We develop a physical model of three-dimensional active wetting that explains this mode of collective durotaxis in terms of a balance between in-plane active traction and tissue contractility, and out-of-plane surface tension. Finally, we show that the distribution of cluster displacements has a heavy tail, with infrequent but large cellular hops that contribute to durotactic migration. Our study demonstrates a physical mechanism of collective durotaxis, through both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion ligands, based on the wetting properties of active droplets.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) decay is generally initiated by removal of the 3 polyadenosine (poly(A)) tail by the CCR4-NOT complex. Yeast Ccr4-Not binds and ubiquitinates ribosomes stalled on mRNAs with sub-optimal codons to trigger deadenylation and decay of the associated transcript. However, the mammalian ortholog of the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit, CNOT4, is not a constitutive component of human CCR4-NOT. It therefore remains unclear how the mammalian deadenylation machinery targets stalled ribosomes. Here, we reconstitute translational stalling on non-optimal codons. We find that human CCR4-NOT recognizes translating mammalian ribosomes and is required for stable CNOT4 association. Our cryoEM structure reveals that the CNOT3 subunit detects slow translation and locks the L1 stalk of the ribosome in an open conformation to impede further elongation. Using crosslinking mass spectrometry, we show that CNOT4 and CNOT11 also bind in the vicinity of the E site. Overall, our work defines how CCR4-NOT enforces ribosomal stalling in response to low codon optimality.",

    "abstract": "Dedifferentiation is the reversion of differentiated cells to a stem cell like fate, whereby, the gene expression program of mature cells is altered and genes associated with multipotency are expressed. Appropriate terminal differentiation of NSCs is essential for restricting the overall number of neurons produced; in addition, faithful production of neuronal subtypes that populate the brain is important for NSC function. Both characteristics of NSCs are specified through temporal patterning of the NSCs driven by the successive expression of temporal transcription factors (tTFs). In this study, we found that ectopic NSCs induced via bHLH transcription factor Deadpan (Dpn) expression fail to undergo timely expression of temporal transcription factors (tTFs), where they express mid-tTF, Sloppy-paired 1 (Slp-1) and fail to express late-tTF Tailless (Tll); consequently generating an excess of Twin of eyeless (Toy) positive neurons at the expense of Reversed polarity (Repo) positive glial cells. In addition to disrupted production of neuronal/glial progeny, Dpn overexpression also resulted in stalled progression through the cell cycle, and a failure to undergo timely terminal differentiation. Mechanistically, DamID studies demonstrated that Dpn directly binds to both Dichaete (D), a Sox-box transcription factor known to repress Slp-1, as well as a number of cell cycle genes. Promoting cell cycle progression or overexpression of D were able to re-trigger the progression of the temporal series in dedifferentiated NBs, restoring both neuronal diversity and timely NB terminal differentiation.",
