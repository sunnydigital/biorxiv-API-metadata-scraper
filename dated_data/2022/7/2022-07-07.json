    "abstract": "Tribbles related homolog 1 (TRIB1) contributes to lipid and glucose homeostasis by facilitating the degradation of cognate cargos by the proteasome. We previously reported that TRIB1 was unstable in non-hepatic cellular models. Moreover, inclusion of proteasome inhibitors failed to prevent TRIB1 loss, consistent with the involvement of proteasome independent degradative processes. In view of the key role of TRIB1 in liver function, we continue our exploration of TRIB1 regulation pathways in two commonly used human hepatocyte models, HuH-7 and HepG2 cells. Proteasome inhibitors potently upregulated both endogenous and recombinant TRIB1 mRNA and protein levels. Increased transcript abundance was independent of MAPK activation while ER stress was a relatively mild inducer. Despite increasing TRIB1 protein abundance and stabilizing bulk ubiquitination, proteasome inhibition failed to stabilize TRIB1, pointing to the predominance of proteasome independent protein degradation processes controlling TRIB1 protein abundance in hepatomas. Proteasome inhibition via downregulation of its PSMB3 regulatory subunit, in contrast to its chemical inhibition, had minimal impact on TRIB1 levels. Moreover, immunoprecipitation experiments showed no evidence of TRIB1 ubiquitination. Cytoplasmic retained TRIB1 was unstable, indicating that TRIB1 lability is regulated prior to its nuclear import. Substitution of the TRIB1 PEST-like region with a GST helical region or N-terminal deletions failed to fully stabilize TRIB1. Finally, inclusion of protease or autophagy inhibitors in vivo did not rescue TRIB1 stability. This work excludes proteasome-mediated degradation as a significant contributor to TRIB1 instability and identifies transcriptional regulation as a prominent mechanism regulating TRIB1 abundance in liver models in response to proteasome inhibition.",

    "abstract": "We recently showed that intravenous infusion of mouse or human, fetal or adult lung cells following conditioning of recipient mice leads to lung chimerism within alveolar and bronchiolar lineages, in distinct  patches containing both epithelial and endothelial cells. We show here, using R26R-Confetti mice as donors, that these multi-lineage patches are derived from a single lung progenitor. FACS of adult mouse lung cells revealed that the putative patch-forming progenitors co-express the endothelial marker CD31 (PECAM-1) and the epithelial marker CD326 (EPCAM). Transplantation of lung cells from transgenic Cre/lox mice expressing membrane GFP under the VEcad promoter (VEcad-Cre-mTmG), led to GFP+ patches comprising both GFP+ endothelial and epithelial cells in vivo, and in ex-vivo culture of CD326+CD31+ progenitors. Single cell mRNAseq of CD326+CD31+ lung cells revealed a subpopulation expressing canonical epithelial and endothelial genes. Such double positive GFP+NKX2.1+SOX17+ cells were also deteceted by immuno-histologial staining in lungs of VEcad-Cre-nTnG (expressing nulear GFP) mice in proximity to blood vessels. These findings provide new insights on lung progenitros and lung development and suggest a potential novel approach for lung regeneration.",

While direct studies are hindered, here we investigate the dynamics of human primordial germ cell (PGCs) specification using in vitro models with temporally resolved single-cell transcriptomics and in-depth characterisation to in vivo datasets from human and non-human primates, including a 3D marmoset reference atlas. We elucidate the molecular signature for the transient gain of competence for germ cell fate during peri-implantation epiblast development. Further, we show that both the PGCs and amnion arise from transcriptionally similar TFAP2A positive progenitors at the posterior end of the embryo. Notably, genetic loss of function experiments show that TFAP2A is crucial for initiating the PGC fate without detectably affecting the amnion, and its subsequently replaced by TFAP2C as an essential component of the genetic network for PGC fate. Accordingly, amniotic cells continue to emerge from the progenitors in the posterior epiblast, but importantly, this is also a source of nascent PGCs.",

    "abstract": "The African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae (Hemiptera: Triozidae), is a vector of citrus greening disease (Huanglonbing - HLB) caused by the bacterium Candidatus liberibacter. Native from Africa, T. erytreae was detected in northwestern Spain in 2014, and since then it has established along Atlantic coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Given the severe bio-economic impact of HLB, an accurate assessment of the risk of potential spread of African citrus psyllid to citrus-growing regions of the Mediterranean area and the rest of the world, is urgently needed to design effective control strategies and anticipate economic losses. Therefore, I calibrated species distribution models to understand the bioclimatic characteristics that shape the distribution of T. erytreae and to assess the climatic suitability of the worlds major citrus-growing regions for this species under current and future climate conditions. The models identify mild summer and winter temperatures and high levels of precipitation as optimal conditions for long-term psyllid establishment. It is noteworthy that the models trained without the available occurrences in continental Europe, predict only the Atlantic coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula as highly climatically suitable in Europe, which corresponds perfectly with the area currently invaded by the psyllid. This striking predictive accuracy lends great credibility to the model predictions. Most economically important citrus production areas in the world are predicted to be of low or moderate climatic suitability for T. erytreae. This research is crucial for assessing the global risk of HLB and is particularly timely for Europe where the African citrus psyllid has recently been detected.",

    "abstract": "Non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterial diazotrophs closely associated with the roots of grasses probably contribute most of the new nitrogen acquired to sustain productive natural grasslands, yet their ecology is poorly understood, especially in southern Africa. We looked for genetic evidence, using qPCR and gel electrophoresis, for the presence of the bacterial nifH gene associated with the roots of four grass species (20 plants each) in a mesic grassland in South Arica, which would indicate the potential for N fixation by diazotrophs. Grasses most tolerant of low N (Aristida junciformis) were predicted to harbour the most diazotrophs, especially compared to those most responsive to fertiliser N (Eragrostis curvula). However, the nifH gene was found in all 80 root samples and did not differ in copy number between species. Sequencing of a representative sample confirmed the identity of the nifH gene. The recently burned half of the grassland had 60% more nifH genes than the area burned 15 months previously, suggesting that grass growth stimulated by fire could recruit diazotrophs. Given their ubiquity and importance in the N economy of grasslands, research is required to characterise root-associated diazotroph communities, quantify their N fixation rates, and understand their environmental controls.",

    "abstract": "Predicting species coexistence can be difficult often because underlying assembly processes are unknown and data are limited. However, accurate predictions are needed for design and forecasting problems in biodiversity conservation, climate change, invasion ecology, restoration ecology, and synthetic ecology. Here we describe an approach (Learning Outcomes Via Experiments; LOVE) where a limited set of experiments are conducted and multiple community outcomes measured (richness, composition, and abundance), from which a model is trained to predict outcomes for arbitrary experiments. Across seven taxonomically datasets, LOVE predicts test outcomes with low error when trained on [~]100 randomly-selected experiments. LOVE can then prioritize experiments for tasks like maximizing outcome richness or total abundance, or minimizing abundances of unwanted species. LOVE complements existing mechanism-first approaches to prediction and shows that rapid screening of communities for desirable properties may become possible.\n\nAuthor summaryPredicting which species will or will not coexist with each other is a central challenge for ecology. Success would allow experimental assembly of communities with desirable properties (e.g. high biodiversity). Mechanistic approaches to this problem run into data and theory limitations, as well as vast combinatorial complexity. Here we instead show to predict and prioritize coexistence without needing to identify or quantify any ecological mechanisms, based on statistical learning from randomly-selected experiments. The approach may help us to discover and then assemble ecological communities with desirable properties.",

    "abstract": "Urban heat islands, where temperatures are elevated relative to non-urban surrounds, are near-ubiquitous in cities globally. Yet, the magnitude and form of urban heat islands in the tropics, where heat has a large morbidity and mortality burden, is less well understood, especially for socioeconomically diverse communities such as those living in urban informal settlements. We utilised 29 years of Landsat satellite-derived surface temperature, corroborated by in situ measurements, to provide a detailed spatial and temporal assessment of urban heat islands in Makassar, Indonesia, a city that is representative of rapidly growing urban settlements across the tropics. We did so with explicit consideration of vulnerable communities living informally. Our analysis identified surface urban heat islands of up to 9.2 {degrees}C in long-urbanised parts of the city and 6.3 {degrees}C in informal settlements, the seasonal patterns of which were driven by change in non-urban areas rather than in urban areas themselves. In recently urbanised areas, the majority of urban heat island increase occurred before areas became 50% urbanised. As tropical cities continue to expand we expect that urban heat islands will develop quickly as land is urbanised, whereas the established heat island in long-urbanised areas will remain stable in response to city expansion. Green and blue space protect some informal settlements from the worst urban heat islands and maintenance of such space will be essential to mitigate the growing heat burden from urban expansion and anthropogenic climate change. We advocate for green space to be prioritised in urban planning, redevelopment and informal settlement upgrading programs, with consideration of the unique environmental and socioeconomic context of tropical cities.\n\nHighlightsO_LILong-term, fine-scale data are essential to understand the dynamics of urban heat\nC_LIO_LISurface heat islands reached 9.2 {degrees}C in the urban core, 6.3 {degrees}C in informal settlements\nC_LIO_LIIn situ data support the use of remote sensing for heat island characterisation\nC_LIO_LIThe majority of heat island growth occurred before land was 50% urbanised\nC_LIO_LIGreen and blue space can mitigate heat in informal settlements\nC_LI",

Predicting which plasmids spread/decline in the long term remains a huge challenge, even though some key parameters influencing plasmid stability have been identified, such as plasmid growth costs and horizontal transfer rates. Here, we show these parameters evolve in a strain-specific way among clinical plasmids/bacteria, and this occurs rapidly enough to alter the relative likelihoods of different bacterium-plasmid combinations spreading/declining. We used experiments with Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistance plasmids isolated from patients, paired with a mathematical model, to show long-term plasmid stability (beyond antibiotic exposure) was better explained by evolutionary changes in plasmid-stability traits than by initial variation among bacterium-plasmid combinations. Evolutionary trajectories were specific to particular bacterium-plasmid combinations. Genome sequencing and genetic manipulation helped explain this, revealing epistatic (here, strain-dependent) effects of key genetic changes affecting horizontal plasmid transfer. Several genetic changes involved mobile elements and pathogenicity islands. Rapid strain-specific evolution can thus outweigh ancestral phenotypes as a predictor of plasmid stability. Accounting for strain-specific plasmid evolution in natural populations could improve our ability to anticipate and manage successful bacterium-plasmid combinations.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new genes is an important driver of evolutionary novelty. Yet, we lack a conceptual and computational approach that accurately traces gene-family founder events and effectively associates them with trait innovation and major radiation events. Here, we present GenEra, a DIAMOND-fuelled gene-family founder inference framework that addresses previously raised limitations and biases of founder gene detection in genomic phylostratigraphy by accounting for homology detection failure (HDF). We demonstrate how GenEra can accelerate gene-family founder computations from several months to a few days for any query genome of interest. We analyzed 30 genomes to explore the emergence of new gene families during the major evolutionary transitions in plants, animals and fungi. The detection of highly conserved protein domains in these gene families indicates that neofunctionalization of preexisting protein domains is a richer source of gene-family founder events compared with de novo gene birth. We report vastly different patterns of gene-family founder events in animal and fungi before and after accounting for HDF. Only plants exhibit a consistent pattern of founder gene emergence after accounting for HDF, suggesting they are more likely to evolve novelty through the emergence of new genes compared to opisthokonts. Finally, we show that gene-family founder bursts are associated with the transition to multicellularity in streptophytes, the terrestrialization of land plants and the origin of angiosperms, as well as with the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals.",

To address these gaps and investigate the interplay between oral and genetic histories, we analyzed whole-genome sequences from 158 Southwest Indian individuals identifying as Bunt, Kodava, Nair, and Kapla. From community interviews and historical literature, we found that all four populations have references to non-Indian origins. We observed that while the Kapla are genetically differentiated from the Bunt, Kodava, and Nair, all four populations are genetically most similar to other Indian populations.

    "abstract": "Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within segmental duplications (SDs) have not been systematically assessed because of the difficulty in mapping short-read sequence data to virtually identical repetitive sequences. Using 102 phased human haplotypes, we constructed 1:1 unambiguous alignments spanning high-identity SDs and compared the pattern of SNVs between unique and SD regions. We find that human SNVs are elevated 60% in SDs compared to unique regions. We estimate that at least 23% of this increase is due to interlocus gene conversion (IGC) with >7 Mbp of SD sequence converted on average per human haplotype. We develop a genome-wide map of IGC donors and acceptors, including 498 acceptor and 454 donor hotspots affecting the exons of ~800 protein-coding genes. The latter includes 171 genes that have \"relocated\" on average 1.61 Mbp in a subset of human haplotypes. Using a coalescent framework, we show that SD regions are evolutionarily older when compared to unique sequences with most of this signal originating from putative IGC loci. SNVs within SDs, however, also exhibit a distinct mutational spectrum where there is a 27.1% increase in transversions that convert cytosine to guanine or the reverse across all triplet contexts. In addition, we observe a 7.6% reduction in the frequency of CpG associated mutations when compared to unique DNA. We hypothesize that these distinct mutational properties help to maintain an overall higher GC content of SD DNA when compared to unique DNA, and we show that these GC-favoring mutational events are likely driven by GC-biased conversion between paralogous sequences.",

Less attention has been given to strategies for comparable detection of rare structural variant (SV) junctions, where different error mechanisms must be addressed. Working from cell samples with known SV properties, we demonstrate that Duplex Sequencing (DuplexSeq), which demands confirmation of variants on both strands of a source DNA molecule, eliminates false SV junctions arising from chimeric PCR. DuplexSeq could not address frequent intermolecular ligation artifacts that arise during Y-adapter addition prior to strand denaturation without requiring multiple source molecules. In contrast, tagmentation libraries coupled with data filtering based on strand family size greatly reduced both artifact classes and enabled efficient and specific detection of even single-molecule SV junctions. The throughput of SV capture sequencing (svCapture) and the high base-level accuracy of DuplexSeq provided detailed views of the microhomology profile and limited occurrence of de novo SNVs near the junctions of hundreds of sub-clonal and newly created SVs, suggesting end joining as a predominant formation mechanism. The open source svCapture pipeline enables rare SV detection as a routine addition to SNVs/indels in properly prepared capture sequencing libraries.",

    "abstract": "1Change in behavior is one of the earliest measurable responses to variation in habitat suitability, making the study of factors that promote behaviors particularly important in areas undergoing environmental change. We applied hidden Markov models to movement data of 14 polar bears, Ursus maritimus, from Western Hudson Bay, Canada between 2011 and 2021 during the foraging season (January-June) when bears inhabit the sea ice. The model incorporated bear movement and orientation relative to wind to classify three behaviors (stationary/drifting, area-restricted search, and olfactory search), and investigated 11 factors to identify conditions that may promote these behaviors. In contrast to other polar bear populations, we found high levels of evening activity, with active behaviors peaking around 20:00. We identified an increase in activity as the ice-covered season progressed. This apparent shift in foraging strategy from still-hunting to active search corresponds to a shift in prey availability (i.e., increase in haul-out behavior during winter to the spring pupping and molting seasons). Last, we described spatial patterns of distribution with respect to season and ice concentration that may be indicative of variation in habitat quality and segregation by bear age that may reflect competitive exclusion. Our observations were generally consistent with predictions of the marginal value theorem, and differences between our findings compared to other populations could be explained by variation in regional or temporal variation in resource abundance or distribution. Our findings and novel methodology can help identify periods, locations, and environmental conditions representing critical habitat.",

    "abstract": "Adequate pain management is essential for ethical and scientific reasons in animal experiments and should completely cover the period of expected pain without the need for frequent re-application. However, current depot formulations of Buprenorphine are only available in the USA and have limited duration of action. Recently, a new microparticulate Buprenorphine formulation (BUP-Depot) for sustained release has been developed as an alternative product within Europe. Pharmacokinetics indicate a potential effectiveness for about 72h. Here, we investigated whether the administration of the BUP-Depot ensures continuous and sufficient analgesia in two mouse femoral fracture models and could therefore serve as a potent alternative to the application of Tramadol via drinking water. Both protocols were examined for analgesic effectiveness, side effects on experimental readout, and effects on fracture healing outcomes in male and female C57BL/6N mice. The BUP-Depot provided effective analgesia for 72h, comparable to the effectiveness of Tramadol in drinking water. Fracture healing outcome was not different between analgesic regimes. The availability of a Buprenorphine depot formulation for laboratory animals in Europe would be a beneficial addition for extended pain relief in mice, thereby increasing animal welfare.",

    "abstract": "To combat the emergence of drug resistance against the existing antimalarials, novel side chain containing 7-chloroquinoline-indole-chalcones tethered with a triazole (CQTrICh-analogs 7 (a-s) and 9) were designed and synthesized by reacting substituted 1-phenyl-3-(1-(prop-2-yn-1- yl)-1H-indol-3-yl) prop-2-en-1-one and 1-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)-1H-indole-3-carbaldehyde with 4- azido-7-chloroquinoline, respectively via a  click reaction. The selected CQTrICh-analogs: 7l and 7r inhibited chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) and resistant (RKL-9) strains of Plasmodium falciparum, with IC50 values of 2.4 {micro}M & 1.8 {micro}M (7l), and 3.5 {micro}M & 2.7 {micro}M (7r), respectively, and showed insignificant hemolysis and cytotoxicity in mammalian cells. Intra-erythrocytic progression studies revealed that the active hybrids: 7l and 7r are effective against the mature stages of the parasite. Given the importance of Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (PfCDPK1) in the parasite biology, notably during late schizogony and subsequent invasion of merozoites into host RBCs, we identified this protein as a possible molecular target of these active hybrids. In silico interaction analysis indicated that 7l and 7r stably interact with the catalytically active ATP-binding pocket of PfCDPK1, by the formation of energetically favorable H-bonds. Furthermore, in vitro Microscale Thermophoresis and kinase assays with recombinant PfCDPK1 demonstrated that the active hybrids interact with and inhibit the kinase activity, thus presumably responsible for the parasite growth inhibition. Interestingly, 7l and 7r showed no inhibitory effect on the human kinases, indicating that they are selective for the parasite kinase. Conceivably, we report the antiplasmodial potential of novel kinase targeting bio-conjugates, a step towards developing pan-kinase inhibitors, which is a prerequisite for cross-stage anti-malarial protection.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=115 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/498981v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113574borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c81a33org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1301d22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c8cac5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of intraspecific genomes is a prerequisite to performing population genetic analysis and microbial epidemiology. However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster. We demonstrate Maasts utility on species with thousands of genomes by reconstructing the genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori across the globe and tracking SARS-CoV-2 diversification during the COVID-19 outbreak. Maast is a fast, reliable SNP genotyping tool that empowers population genetic meta-analysis of microbes at an unrivaled scale.\n\nAvailabilitysource code of Maast is available at https://github.com/zjshi/Maast.\n\nContactkpollard@gladstone.ucsf.edu",

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of protein function is critical to elucidate life mechanism and design new drugs. We proposed a novel deep-learning method, ATGO, to predict Gene Ontology (GO) attributes of proteins through a triplet neural-network architecture embedded with pre-trained self-attention transformer models. The method was systematically tested on 1068 non-redundant benchmarking proteins and 3328 targets from the third Critical Assessment of Protein Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. Experimental results showed that ATGO achieved a significant increase of the GO prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in all aspects of molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Detailed data analyses showed that the major advantage of ATGO lies in the utilization of attention transformer models which can extract discriminative functional pattern from the feature embeddings. Meanwhile, the proposed triplet network helps enhance the association of functional similarity with feature similarity in the sequence embedding space. In addition, it was found that the combination of the network scores with the complementary homology-based inferences could further improve the accuracy and coverage of the predicted models. These results demonstrated a new avenue for high-accuracy deep-learning function prediction that is applicable to large-scale protein function annotations from sequence alone.\n\nAvailabilityThe benchmark dataset, standalone package, and online server for ATGO are available at https://zhanggroup.org/ATGO/.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the post-genome sequencing era, a major challenge in computational molecular biology is to annotate the biological functions of all gene and gene products, which have been classified, in the context of the widely used Gene Ontology (GO), into three aspects of molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. In this work, we proposed a new open-source deep-learning architecture, ATGO, to deduce GO terms of proteins from the primary amino acid sequence, through the integration of the triplet neural-network with attention transformer models. Large benchmark tests showed that, when powered with a pre-trained self-attention transformer model, ATGO achieved a significantly improved performance than other state-of-the-art approaches in all the GO aspect predictions. Following the rapid progress of self-attention neural network techniques, which have demonstrated remarkable impacts on language processing and multi-sensory data process, and most recently on protein structure prediction, this study showed the significant potential of attention transformer models on protein function annotations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the pathogenicity of rare variants in the causative genes characterizing the familial form remains largely unknown. To predict the pathogenicity of such variants, in silico analysis is commonly used. In some cases of ALS, the gene mutations are concentrated in specific regions, and the resulting alterations in protein structure are thought to significantly affect pathogenicity. However, existing methods have not taken this issue into account. To address this, we have developed a technique termed MOVA (method for evaluating the pathogenicity of missense variants using AlphaFold2), which applies positional information for structural variants predicted by AlphaFold2. Here we examined the utility of MOVA for analysis of several causative genes of ALS.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed variants of six ALS-related genes (TARDBP, FUS, SETX, TBK1, OPTN, and SOD1) and classified them as pathogenic or neutral. For each gene, the features of the variants, including their positions in the 3D structure predicted by AlphaFold2, were entered into a random forest algorithm and evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. We compared how accurately MOVA was able to classify the pathogenic and neutral mutation variants.\n\nResultsMOVA yielded useful results (AUC [&ge;]0.70 for 3 (TARDBP 0.755, FUS 0.844, and SOD1 0.787) of the 6 genes) and was particularly useful for genes where pathogenic mutations were concentrated at specific sites (TARDBP, FUS).\n\nConclusionsMOVA is useful for predicting the virulence of rare variants of ALS-causing genes in which mutations are concentrated at specific structural sites.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) patrol the body as immunological sentinels and search for pathogens. Upon stimulation, immature DCs (imDCs) become mature DCs (mDCs), which migrate to the lymph nodes and present antigens to T cells. The migratory behavior is crucial for initiating and controlling immune responses; however, the properties of the highly heterogeneous and dynamic motility phenotype are not fully understood. Here, we established an unsupervised machine learning (ML) strategy to investigate spatiotemporal motility patterns in long-term, two-dimensional cell migration trajectories, and determined the number of motility patterns and how these are related to the maturation status. We identified three distinct migratory modes independent of the cell state: slow-diffusive (SD), slow-persistent (SP), and fast-persistent (FP). We found that maturation-dependent motility changes are emergent properties of the distribution and dynamic transitions of these three modes. Remarkably, imDCs changed their migration modes more frequently, and predominantly followed the SD[-&gt;]FP[-&gt;]SP[-&gt;]SD unicyclic transition, indicating that imDCs rapidly increase their speed during the shift from diffusive to persistent motility; however, persistence progressively declines when switching back to diffusive motility. In contrast, mDCs show no transition directionality. Our ML-promoted motility pattern analysis and history-dependent mode transition investigation may provide new insights into the complex process of biological motility.",

    "abstract": "1From bacteria to humans, adaptive immune systems provide learned memories of past infections. Despite their vast biological differences, adaptive immunity shares features from microbes to vertebrates such as emergent immune diversity, long-term coexistence of hosts and pathogens, and fitness pressures from evolving pathogens and adapting hosts, yet there is no conceptual model that addresses all of these together. To address these questions, we propose and solve a simple phenomenological model of CRISPR-based adaptive immunity in microbes. We show that in coexisting phage and bacteria populations, immune diversity in both populations emerges spontaneously and in tandem, that bacteria track phage evolution with a context-dependent lag, and that high levels of diversity are paradoxically linked to low overall CRISPR immunity. We define average immunity, an important summary parameter predicted by our model, and use it to perform synthetic time-shift analyses on available experimental data to reveal different modalities of coevolution. Finally, immune cross-reactivity in our model leads to qualitatively different states of evolutionary dynamics, including an influenza-like traveling wave regime that resembles a similar state in models of vertebrate adaptive immunity. Our results show that CRISPR immunity provides a tractable model, both theoretically and experimentally, to understand general features of adaptive immunity.",

Here, by generating an isoform-specific knockout of LAMP2A, we show that CMA deficiency promotes proliferation and tumor growth in human cancers of mesenchymal origin. Accordingly, we observed that LAMP2A diminishes in metastatic lesions compared to matched primary human tumors from the same patients. Loss of CMA enhanced TGF{beta} signaling in tumors, rewired the tumor metabolome to promote anabolic pathways and mitochondrial metabolism, meeting the metabolic requirements of rapid growth. Mechanistically, we show that TGF{beta}R2 enhances the enzymatic activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), to promote the generation of nucleotides. Consequently, pharmacological inhibition of TGF{beta}-signaling in LAMP2A-KO cells suppresses G6PD activity, mitochondrial metabolism, and proliferation to WT levels. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism suppressed LAMP2A-KO driven proliferation. Overall, our study provides a molecular mechanism on the CMAs tumor-suppressive function by connecting two important oncogenic pathways, the TGF{beta} signaling and PPP metabolism, to the loss-of-function LAMP2A in mesenchymal cancer types.",

Late diagnosis is directly associated with the incidence of metastatic disease and remarkably limits the effectiveness of conventional anticancer therapies at the advanced tumor stage. In this study, we investigated the role of 5AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in the metastatic progression of cervical cancer. Since the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known as major mechanism enabling cancer cell metastasis, cell lines, which accurately represent this process, have been used as a research model. We used C-4I and HTB-35 cervical cancer cell lines representing distant stages of the disease, in which we genetically modified the expression of the AMPK catalytic subunit . We have shown that tumor progression leads to metabolic deregulation which results in reduced expression and activity of AMPK. We also demonstrated that AMPK is related to the ability of cells to acquire invasive phenotype and potential for in vivo metastases, and its activity may inhibit these processes. Our findings support the hypothesis that AMPK is a promising therapeutic target and modulation of its expression and activity may improve the efficacy of cervical cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of cancer cell states within the tumor microenvironment is a key to understanding tumor biology and an important step toward the development of precision therapies. To reconstruct this information from bulk RNA-seq profiles, we developed the XDec Simplex Mapping (XDec-SM) approach, a reference-optional deconvolution method that leverages single-cell information, when such information is available, to map tumors and the states of constituent cells onto a biologically interpretable, low-dimensional space. When applied to breast tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), XDec-SM infers the identity of constituent cell types and their proportions. XDec-SM also infers cancer cells states within individual tumors that associate with DNA methylation patterns, driver somatic mutations, pathway activation and metabolic coupling between stromal and breast cancer cells. By projecting tumors, cancer cell lines, and PDX models onto the same map, we identify both in vitro and in vivo models with matching cancer cell states. Map position is also predictive of therapy response, thus opening the prospects for precision therapy informed by experiments in model systems matched to tumors in vivo by cancer cell state.",

The available synthetic drugs to treat diarrhea have limited safety and efficacy. Thus, people are still dependent on the herbal remedies for managing diarrhea.\n\nObjectiveTo evaluate in vivo antidiarrheal activities of the hydro-alcoholic leaf extracts of Schinus molle L. (Anacardiaceae) in mice.\n\nMethodsThe 80% methanol leaf extract was prepared by successive maceration technique. The antidiarrheal activity of the extract was evaluated using castor oil induced diarrhea, enteropooling and small intestine transit models. The test groups received various doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) of the extract, whereas positive controls received Loperamide (3 mg/kg) and negative controls received vehicle (distilled water, 10 ml/kg). Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeys posthoc test.\n\nResultIn the castor oil induced diarrheal model, the 80% methanol extract delayed onset of defecation and reduced the number and weight of feces at all tested doses significantly as compared to the negative control. In the enteropooling test, the 80ME significantly (P<0.001) reduced the weight and volume of intestinal fluid at all tested doses when compared to negative control. Results from the charcoal meal test revealed that the extracts produced a significant anti-motility effect at all tested doses as compared to negative control.\n\nConclusionThis study confirmed the antidiarrheal activity of the hydro-alcoholic extract and the highest test dose produced the maximum antidiarrheal activity in all models",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEngineered heart tissue (EHT) transplantation represents an innovative, regenerative approach for heart failure patients. Late preclinical trials are underway, and the first clinical trial has started in 2021. Preceding studies revealed functional recovery after implantation of in vitro-matured EHT in the subacute stage while transplantation in a chronic injury setting was less efficient. We hypothesized that the use of immature EHT patches (EHTIm) could improve cardiomyocytes (CM) engraftment. Chronic myocardial injury was induced in a guinea pig model (n=14). EHTIm (15x106 cells) were transplanted directly after casting. Functional consequences were assessed by serial echocardiography. Animals were sacrificed four weeks after transplantation and hearts were excised for histological analysis. Cryo-injury lead to large transmural scars amounting to 26% of the left ventricle. Grafts were identified by a positive staining for human Ku80 and dystrophin, remuscularizing 9% of the scar area on average. The CM density in the graft was higher compared to previous studies with in vitro-matured EHTs and showed a greater population of immature CM. Echocardiographic analysis showed a small improvement of left ventricular function after EHTIm transplantation. In a small translational proof-of-concept study human scale EHTIm patches (4.5x108 cells) were epicardially implanted on healthy pig hearts (n=2). In summary, we provide evidence that transplantation of immature EHT patches without pre-cultivation results in better cell engraftment.",

    "abstract": "Trauma, vascular events, or neurodegenerative processes can lead to axonal injury and eventual transection (axotomy). Neurons can survive axotomy, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Excessive water entry into injured neurons poses a particular risk due to swelling and subsequent death. Using in vitro and in vivo neurotrauma model systems based on laser transection, we demonstrated that axotomy triggers actomyosin contraction coupled with calpain activity. As a consequence, neurons shrink acutely to force water out through aquaporin channels preventing swelling and bursting. Inhibiting shrinkage increased the probability of neuronal cell death by about three-fold. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized cytoprotective response mechanism to neurotrauma and offer a fresh perspective on pathophysiological processes in the nervous system.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWhen the axon of a neuron is cut, its soma shrinks to pump out water to avoid deadly swelling.",

    "abstract": "Synaptotagmin-1 and synaptotagmin-7 are two prominent Ca2+ sensors that regulate exocytosis in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells. Upon binding Ca2+, both proteins partially penetrate lipid bilayers that bear anionic phospholipids, but the specific underlying mechanisms that enable them to trigger exocytosis remain controversial. Here, we examined the biophysical properties of these two synaptotagmin isoforms and compared their interactions with phospholipid membranes. We discovered that synaptotagmin-1*membrane interactions are greatly influenced by membrane order; tight packing of phosphatidylserine inhibits binding due to impaired membrane penetration. In contrast, synaptotagmin-7 exhibits robust membrane binding and penetration activity regardless of phospholipid acyl chain structure. Thus, synaptotagmin-7 is a \"super-penetrator\". We exploited these observations to specifically isolate and examine the role of membrane penetration in synaptotagmin function. Using nanodisc-black lipid membrane electrophysiology, we demonstrate that membrane penetration is a critical component that underlies how synaptotagmin proteins regulate reconstituted, exocytic fusion pores in response to Ca2+.",

However, little is known about the impact of fluctuations in heart activity on other internal representations. Here we investigate cardiac influences on learning-related internal representations - absolute and signed prediction errors. By combining machine learning techniques with electroencephalography (EEG) and both simple, direct indices of task performance and computational model-derived indices of learning, we demonstrate that just as people are more sensitive to low magnitude, near threshold sensory stimuli in certain cardiac phases, so are they more sensitive to low magnitude absolute prediction errors in the same cycles. Importantly, however, this occurs even when the low magnitude prediction errors are associated with clearly suprathreshold sensory events. In addition, participants exhibiting stronger difference in their prediction errors representations between cardiac cycles exhibited higher learning rates and greater task accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) is highly connected to integrate visual perceptual inputs with feedback from cognitive and emotional networks. In this study, we used electrical brain stimulation to understand how different inputs from multiple brain regions drive unique electrophysiological responses in the VTC.\n\nWe recorded intracranial EEG data in 6 patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for epilepsy surgery evaluation. Pairs of electrodes were stimulated with single pulse electrical stimulation, and corticocortical evoked potential (CCEP) responses were measured at electrodes in the collateral sulcus and lateral occipitotemporal sulcus of the VTC. Using a novel unsupervised machine learning method, we uncovered 2 to 4 distinct response shapes, termed basis profile curves (BPCs), at each recording electrode in the 11 to 500 ms post-stimulation interval.\n\nCCEPs of unique shape and high amplitude were elicited following stimulation of several regions and classified into a set of four consensus BPCs across subjects. One of the consensus BPCs was primarily elicited by stimulation of the hippocampus; another by stimulation of the amygdala; a third by stimulation of lateral cortical sites, such as the middle temporal gyrus; and the final one by stimulation of multiple distributed sites. Stimulation also produced sustained high frequency power decreases and low frequency power increases that spanned multiple BPC categories.\n\nCharacterizing distinct shapes in stimulation responses provides a novel description of connectivity to the VTC and reveals significant differences in input from cortical and limbic structures.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDisentangling the numerous input influences on highly connected areas in the brain is a critical step toward understanding how different brain networks work together to produce function. Single pulse electrical stimulation is an effective tool to accomplish this goal because the shapes and amplitudes of signals recorded from electrodes are informative of the synaptic physiology of the stimulation-driven inputs. We focused on targets in the ventral temporal cortex because it is an area strongly implicated in visual object perception. By using a data-driven clustering algorithm, we identified anatomical regions with distinct input connectivity profiles to the ventral temporal cortex. Examining high frequency power changes revealed possible modulation of excitability at the recording site induced by electrical stimulation of connected regions.",

    "abstract": "Long-term synaptic plasticity has been shown to be mediated via cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]). Using a synaptic model which implements calcium-based long-term plasticity via two sources of Ca2+, NMDA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), we show in dendritic cable simulations, that the interplay between these two calcium sources can result in a diverse array of heterosynaptic effects. When spatially clustered synaptic input produces a local NMDA spike, the resulting dendritic depolarization can activate VGCCs at non-activated spines, resulting in heterosynaptic plasticity. NMDA spike activation at a given dendritic location will tend to depolarize dendritic regions that are located distally to the input site more than dendritic sites that are proximal to it. This asymmetry produces a hierarchical effect in branching dendrites, where an NMDA spike at a proximal branch can induce heterosynaptic plasticity primarily at branches that are distal to it. We also explored how simultaneously activated synaptic clusters located at different dendritic locations synergistically affect the plasticity at these locations, as well as the heterosynaptic plasticity of an inactive synapse \"sandwiched\" between them. We conclude that the inherent electrical asymmetry of dendritic trees enables sophisticated schemes for spatially targeted supervision of heterosynaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The human brain extracts statistical regularities from the surrounding environment in a process referred to as statistical learning. Recent behavioural evidence suggests that developmental dyslexia affects statistical learning. However, surprisingly few neurophysiological studies have assessed how developmental dyslexia affects the neural processing underlying statistical learning. In this study, we used electroencephalography to explore the neural correlates of an important aspect of statistical learning - sensitivity to transitional probabilities - in individuals with developmental dyslexia. Adults diagnosed with developmental dyslexia (n = 17) and controls (n = 19) were exposed to a continuous stream of sound triplets in which a few triplet endings were location deviants (i.e., were presented from an unexpected speaker direction) or statistical deviants (i.e., had a low transitional probability given the triplets first two sounds). Location deviants elicited a large location mismatch negativity (MMN), which was larger in controls than dyslexics. Statistical deviants elicited a small, yet significant statistical MMN (sMMN) in controls, whereas the dyslexic individuals did not exhibit a statistical MMN. These results suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying statistical learning are impaired in developmental dyslexia.\n\nSignificance statementWe assessed the neural correlates of statistical learning in individuals with developmental dyslexia.

Astrocytes play important role in[K+]e homeostasis and compute neuronal information. Yet it is unclear how neuronal oscillations are regulated by astrocytic K+ homeostasis. Here we identify the astrocytic inward-rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1 (a.k.a. Kcnj10) as a key molecular player for neuronal rhythmicity in the spinal central pattern generator (CPG). By combining two-photon calcium imaging with electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry and genetic tools, we report that astrocytes display Ca2+ transients before and during oscillations of neighbouring neurons. Inhibition of astrocytic Ca2+ transients with BAPTA decreases the barium-sensitive Kir4.1 current responsible of K+ clearance. Finally, we show in mice that Kir4.1 knockdown in astrocytes progressively prevents neuronal oscillations and alters the locomotor pattern resulting in lower motor performances in challenging tasks. These data identify astroglial Kir4.1 channels as key regulators of neuronal rhythmogenesis in the CPG driving locomotion.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWSTATEMENTC_SCPLOWDespite decades of research, the cellular mechanisms responsible of the synchronized rhythmic oscillations driving locomotion remain elusive. To gain insight into the function of the spinal locomotor network, numerous studies have characterized diverse classes of locomotor-related neurons to determine their role in generating rhythmic movements during locomotion. In contrast, studies investigating non-neuronal components of the spinal cord are sparse. Our study represents a significant breakthrough by identifying astrocytic K+ uptake as a key regulator of neuronal rhythmicity synchronization and locomotor pattern at the cellular, microcircuit and system levels. These data provide mechanistic insights into the neuroglial dialogue at play during rhythmogenesis and point to a novel astroglial target for restoring normal neuronal network excitability in brain disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.",

Vaccination or productive infection results in a polyclonal mixture of class-switched IgG antibodies comprised of four subclasses, each encoding distinct Fc regions that differentially engage innate immune functions. Despite evidence that innate immunity contributes to protection, the relative contribution of individual IgG subclasses is unknown. Here we use vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP) in humanized mice to interrogate the efficacy of individual IgG subclasses during prevention of vaginal HIV transmission by VRC07, a potent CD4-binding site directed bNAb. We find that VRC07-IgG2, which lacks Fc-mediated functionality, exhibits significantly reduced protection in vivo relative to other subclasses. However, even low concentrations of highly functional VRC07-IgG1 yields substantial protection against vaginal challenge, suggesting that interventions capable of eliciting modest titers of functional subclasses may provide meaningful benefit against infection.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a ubiquitous second messenger that transduces signals from cellular receptors to downstream effectors. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiological agent of tuberculosis, devotes a considerable amount of coding capacity to produce, sense, and degrade cAMP. Despite this fact, our understanding of how cAMP regulates Mtb physiology remains limited. Here, we took a genetic approach to investigate the function of the sole essential adenylate cyclase in Mtb H37Rv, Rv3645. We found that lack of rv3645 resulted in increased sensitivity to numerous antibiotics by a mechanism independent of substantial increases in envelope permeability. We made the unexpected observation that rv3645 is conditionally essential for Mtb growth only in the presence of long-chain fatty acids, a host-relevant carbon source. A suppressor screen further identified mutations in the atypical cAMP phosphodiesterase rv1339 that suppress both fatty-acid and drug sensitivity phenotypes in strains lacking rv3645. Using mass spectrometry, we found that Rv3645 is the dominant source of cAMP under standard laboratory growth conditions, that cAMP production is the essential function of Rv3645 in the presence of long-chain fatty acids, and that reduced levels of cAMP result in increased antibiotic susceptibility. Our work defines rv3645 and cAMP as central mediators of intrinsic multidrug resistance and fatty acid metabolism in Mtb and highlights the potential utility of small molecule modulators of cAMP signaling.",

    "abstract": "Upon WNT/{beta}-catenin pathway activation, stabilized {beta}-catenin travels to the nucleus where it associates with the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors, which constitutively bind to genomic Wnt Responsive Elements (WREs), to activate transcription of target genes. Discovering the binding profile of {beta}-catenin is therefore required to unambiguously assign direct targets of WNT signaling. Cleavage Under Target and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) has recently emerged as a prime technique for mapping the binding profile of chromatin interacting proteins. In our attempts to profile different regulators of the WNT/{beta}-catenin transcriptional complex, CUT&RUN performed reliably when targeting transcription factors such as TCF/LEF, but it failed to produce consistent binding patterns of the non-DNA-binding {beta}-catenin. Here, we present a biochemical modification of the CUT&RUN protocol, which we refer to as LoV-U (Low Volume and Urea), that enables the generation of robust and reproducible {beta}-catenin binding profiles. CUT&RUN-LoV-U uncovers direct WNT/{beta}-catenin target genes in human cells, as well as in ex vivo cells isolated from developing mouse tissue. CUT&RUN-LoV-U can profile all classes of chromatin regulators tested and is well suited for simultaneous processing of several samples. We submit that the application of our protocol will allow the detection of the complex system of tissue-specific WNT/{beta}-catenin target genes, together with other non-DNA-binding transcriptional regulators that act downstream of ontogenetically fundamental signaling cascades.",

These studies are based on the implicit assumption that early life-history traits are relevant for stress tolerance in the wild. Here we test this assumption by combining two datasets from studies on the same 60 full-sib families. These families had been experimentally produced from wild breeders to determine, in separate samples, (i) stress tolerances of singly kept embryos in the laboratory and (ii) growth of juveniles during 6 months in the wild. We found that growth in the wild was well predicted by larval size of their full sibs in the laboratory, especially if these siblings had been experimentally exposed to a pathogen. Exposure to the pathogen had not caused elevated mortality among the embryos but induced early hatching. The strength of this stress-induced change of life history was a significant predictor of juvenile growth in the wild: the stronger the response in the laboratory, the slower the growth in the wild. We conclude that embryo performance in controlled environments can be useful predictors of juvenile performance in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Institutions inclination to fulfilling the mandate of producing quality graduates is overwhelming. Insistent petition for institutions to understand their students is about creating equitable opportunities for the diverse student bodies. However, \"at-risk\" students ubiquitously co-exist. This article conducted a scoping review of literature published locally and internationally that sought to understand \"at-risk\" students in higher education. The study examined the aims, participants, variables, data analytics tools, and the methods used when the topic on \"at-risk\" students is studied. Broadly, we sought the bigger picture of what matters, where, when, why, and how so. The Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework was considered for demarcating appropriate literature for the concept and context of \"at-risk\" students. The JBI protocol was chosen for selecting relevant literature published between 2010 and 2022, searched from the EBSCOhost and ScienceDirect databases. A search tool was developed using the litsearchr R package and screening proceeded guided by the PRISMA framework. Although 1961 articles were obtained after applying the search criteria, 84 articles satisfied the stipulated inclusion criteria. Although Africa is lagging, research on \"at-risk\" students is exponentially growing in America, Europe, and Asia. Notably, relevant articles use academic data to understand students at risk of dropping-out or failing in the first year. Often, statistical and machine learning methods were preferred. Most factors that determined whether a student is at risk of failing or dropping out were found to be highly correlated with high school knowledge. Also, being \"at-risk\" connoted ones geographical context, ethnicity, gender, and academic culture. It was noted that autonomously motivated students, with good time management, succeed. Ideally, institutions need to identify areas that need intervention, including courses where special tutoring programmes are needed. Institutions should detect staff who need further training. Nonetheless, psychosocial well-being programmes should augment institutional investments to improve students success. Precisely, institutional environments should be stimulating, conducive, and motivating.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSeveral fields have described low reproducibility of scientific research and poor accessibility in research reporting practices. Although previous reports have investigated accessible reporting practices that lead to reproducible research in other fields, to date no study has explored the extent of accessible and reproducible research practices in cardiovascular science literature.\n\nMethodsTo study accessibility and reproducibility in cardiovascular research reporting, we screened 400 randomly selected articles published in 2019 in three top cardiovascular science publications: Circulation, the European Heart Journal, and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC). We screened each paper for accessible and reproducible research practices using a set of accessibility criteria including protocol, materials, data, and analysis script availability, as well as accessibility of the publication itself. We also quantified the consistency of open research practices within and across cardiovascular study types and journal formats.\n\nResultsWe identified that fewer than 2% of cardiovascular research publications provide sufficient resources (materials, methods, data, and analysis scripts) to fully reproduce their studies. After calculating an accessibility score as a measure of the extent to which an articles makes its resources available, we also showed that the level of accessibility varies across study types (p = 2e-16) and across journals (p = 5.9e-13). We further show that there are significant differences in which study types share which resources. We also describe the relationship between accessibility scores and corresponding author nationality.\n\nConclusionAlthough the degree to which reproducible reporting practices are present in publications varies significantly across journals and study types; current cardiovascular science reports frequently do not provide sufficient materials, protocols, data, or analysis information to reproduce a study. In the future, having higher standards of accessibility mandated by either journals or funding bodies will help increase the reproducibility of cardiovascular research.\n\nFundingAuthors Gabriel Heckerman, Arely Campos-Melendez, and Chisomaga Ekwueme were supported by an NIH R25 grant from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (R25HL147666).

    "abstract": "An animals need to sleep grows with time spent awake and decays again during sleep. In the brain, a homeostatic process or signal has been proposed to represent sleep need, steadily increasing during wakefulness and gradually decreasing during sleep1,2. However, such dynamics of a sleep homeostat, capturing the changing need to sleep in real time depending on behavior, has so far not been observed in identified cells3-6.\n\nHere, using a system that we developed for monitoring calcium activity over multiple days in head-fixed, walking fruit flies7,8, we find that a class of glia in the fly brain, called ensheathing glia9-11, shows dynamics expected of a sleep homeostat. Calcium levels in these cells - monitored in a central brain area important for memory, navigation and sleep - integrate activity during wakefulness, reset during sleep, and saturate under sleep deprivation. Optogenetic activation of ensheathing glia induces sleep consistent with charging of the homeostat.\n\nThe dynamics of the sleep homeostat, observed in glia of different brain compartments with similar but distinct dynamics, agree with conceptual model expectations1,2,12,13. Ensheathing glia therefore act as a system for sleep control distributed across brain areas. The structural arrangement of these glia suggests that sleep homeostasis differentially impacts large ensembles of cells at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Microglial activation and neuroinflammation are initial steps in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, studies in mouse models and human postmortem samples have yielded divergent results regarding microglia cell states relevant to AD. Here, we investigate 127,000 single cell expression profiles of human microglia isolated freshly from a xenotransplantation model for early AD. While human microglia adopt a disease-associated (DAM) profile, they display a much more pronounced HLA-cell state related to antigen presentation in response to amyloid plaques. In parallel, a distinctive pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine CRM response is mounted against oligomeric amyloid-{beta}. TREM2 and, to a lesser extent, APOE polymorphisms, modulate the response of microglia to amyloid-{beta} plaques, in contrast with the response to oligomeric A{beta}. Specific polygenic risk genes are enriched in each branch of these multi-pronged response of human microglia to amyloid pathology (ARM). ARM responses can be captured in post-mortem studies when reanalyzed in light of this novel, comprehensive data set. In conclusion, therapeutic strategies targeting microglia in AD need to carefully assess how they affect the different cell states, as the overall balance between distinct microglial profiles might determine a protective or damaging outcome.",

    "abstract": "Human Mpox is a highly contagious viral disease caused by Mpox virus, currently causing outbreaks in various regions of the world and considered a global public health problem. Understanding how the virus adapts or transfers to a new host species is crucial for effective prevention and treatment of viral infections. A comprehensive analysis of 1,318 accessible Mpox genomes was conducted to assess potential phenotypic effects, incorporating the examination of pseudogenes, gene duplication and deletion, as well as sequences obtained from the 2022 outbreak. This study we analyzed the genomic sequences of Mpox viruses from different clades and found that only a small percentage of proteins were conserved across the analyzed clades, with many proteins exhibiting various mutations, indicating the potential correlation between lineage or clade and variations in the pathology of human Mpox disease. The study highlights the importance of analyzing aligned regions in viral genomes to understand the evolution of the virus and the impact of structural changes on protein functions. In brief, further investigations are required to establish a correlation between the effects of these genetic modifications and the novel transmission pathways, average age, clinical manifestations, and symptoms observed in the ongoing outbreak.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe DynaSig-ML (\"Dynamical Signatures - Machine Learning\") Python package allows the efficient, user-friendly exploration of 3D dynamics-function relationships in biomolecules, using datasets of experimental measures from large numbers of sequence variants. The DynaSig-ML package is built around the Elastic Network Contact Model (ENCoM), the first and only sequence-sensitive coarse-grained NMA model, which is used to generate the input Dynamical Signatures. Starting from in silico mutated structures, the whole pipeline can be run with just a few lines of Python and modest computational resources. The compute-intensive steps can also easily be parallelized in the case of either large biomolecules or vast amounts of sequence variants. As an example application, we use the DynaSig-ML package to predict the evolutionary fitness of the bacterial enzyme VIM-2 lactamase from deep mutational scan data.\n\nAvailability and implementationDynaSig-ML is open source software available at https://github.com/gregorpatof/dynasigml_package\n\nContactrafael.najmanovich@umontreal.ca",
