    "abstract": "A musicians spontaneous rate of movement, called spontaneous motor tempo (SMT), can be measured while spontaneously playing a simple melody. Data shows that the SMT influences the musicians tempo and synchronization. In this study we present a model that captures these phenomena. We review the results from three previously-published studies: (1) solo musical performance with a pacing metronome tempo that is different from the SMT, (2) solo musical performance without a metronome at a tempo that is faster or slower than the SMT, and (3) duet musical performance between musicians with matching or mismatching SMTs. These studies showed, respectively, that (1) the asynchrony between the pacing metronome and the musicians tempo grew as a function of the difference between the metronome tempo and the musicians SMT, (2) musicians drifted away from the initial tempo toward the SMT, and (3) the absolute asynchronies were smaller if musicians had matching SMTs. We hypothesize that the SMT constantly acts as a pulling force affecting musical actions at a tempo different from a musicians SMT. To test our hypothesis, we developed a model consisting of a non-linear oscillator with Hebbian tempo learning and a pulling force to the models spontaneous frequency. While the models spontaneous frequency emulates the SMT, elastic Hebbian learning allows for frequency learning to match a stimulus frequency. To test our hypothesis, we first fit model parameters to match the data published in (1) and asked whether this same model would explain the data in (2) and (3) without further tuning. Results showed that the models dynamics allowed it to explain all three experiments with the same set of parameters. Our theory offers a dynamical-systems explanation of how an individuals SMT affects synchronization in realistic music performance settings, and the model also enables predictions about performance settings not yet tested.\n\nAuthor summaryIndividuals can keep a musical tempo on their own or timed by another individual or a metronome. Experiments show that individuals show a specific spontaneous rate of periodic action, for example walking, blinking, or singing. Moreover, in a simple metronome synchronization task, an individuals spontaneous rate determines that the individual will tend to anticipate a metronome that is slower, and lag a metronome that is faster. Researchers have hypothesized the mechanisms explaining how spontaneous rates affect synchronization, but no hypothesis can account for all observations yet. Our hypothesis is that individuals rely on adaptive frequency learning during synchronization tasks to adapt the rate of their movements and match another individuals actions or metronome tempo. Adaptive frequency learning also explains why an individuals spontaneous rate persists after carrying out a musical synchronization task. We define a new model with adaptive frequency learning and use it to simulate existing empirical data. Not only can our model explain the empirical data, but it can also make testable predictions. Our results support the theory that the brains endogenous rhythms give rise to spontaneous rates of movement, and that learning dynamics interact with such brain rhythms to allow for flexible synchronization.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection is believed to universally work to lower mutation rates (MR) due to the negative impact of mutations on individual fitness. Mutator alleles have been found to be co-selected by genetic linkage with adaptive alleles in asexual organisms. However, sexual reproduction substantially reduces genetic linkage, allowing selection to efficiently eradicate mutator alleles. The current understanding, therefore, largely postulates that in sexually reproducing populations selection always works to lower MR, limited by the effective population size that determines the overall selection efficiency. In the present paper, we apply in silico experimentation based on the Monte Carlo approach of a sexually reproducing population and demonstrate that selection acting on MR does not universally favor lower MR but depends on the mode of selection acting on adaptive phenotypic traits. We demonstrate a unique previously unreported co-selective process that can drive the evolution of higher MR in sexually reproducing populations. Our results show that MR evolution is also significantly influenced by multigenic inheritance of both MR and adaptive traits. Our study corroborates that MR evolution is significantly impacted by genetic drift; however, its primary source appears to be the amount of genetic variation present in the population under selection, with a lesser role for population size. Based on our study, we propose an expanded population genetics theory of the evolution of mutation rates in sexually reproducing populations. Our results have potential implications for understanding processes underlying rapid adaptive change in speciation and related macroevolutionary patterns.",

    "abstract": "We do not understand how neural nodes operate and coordinate within the recurrent action-perception loops that characterize naturalistic self-environment interactions. Here, we record single-unit spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from the dorsomedial superior temporal area (MSTd), parietal area 7a, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as monkeys navigate in virtual reality to \"catch fireflies.\" This task requires animals to actively sample from a closed-loop virtual environment while concurrently computing continuous latent variables: (i) the distance and angle travelled (i.e., path integration) and (ii) the distance and angle to a memorized firefly location (i.e., a hidden spatial goal). We observed a patterned mixed selectivity, with the prefrontal cortex most prominently coding for latent variables, parietal cortex coding for sensorimotor variables, and MSTd most often coding for eye-movements. However, even the traditionally considered sensory area (i.e., MSTd) tracked latent variables, demonstrating path integration and vector-coding of hidden spatial goals. Further, global encoding profiles and unit-to-unit coupling (i.e., noise correlations) suggested a functional subnetwork composed by MSTd and dlPFC, and not between these and 7a, as anatomy would suggest. We show that the greater the unit-to-unit coupling between MSTd and dlPFC, the more the animals gaze position was indicative of the ongoing location of the hidden spatial goal. We suggest this MSTd-dlPFC subnetwork reflects the monkeys natural and adaptive task strategy wherein they continuously gaze toward the location of the (invisible) target. Together, these results highlight the distributed nature of neural coding during closed action-perception loops and suggest that fine-grain functional subnetworks may be dynamically established to subserve (embodied) task strategies.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePrior genomewide association studies have identified variation in MHC Class I alleles and CCR5{Delta}32 as genetic predictors of viral control, especially in \"elite\" controllers, individuals who remain virally suppressed in the absence of therapy.\n\nDesignCross-sectional genomewide association study.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed custom whole exome sequencing and direct HLA typing from 202 ART-suppressed HIV+ non-controllers in relation to four measures of the peripheral CD4+ T cell reservoir: HIV intact DNA, total (t)DNA, unspliced (us)RNA, and RNA/DNA. Linear mixed models were adjusted for potential covariates including age, sex, nadir CD4+ T cell count, pre-ART HIV RNA, timing of ART initiation, and duration of ART suppression.\n\nResultsPreviously reported \"protective\" host genetic mutations related to viral setpoint (e.g., among elite controllers) were found to predict smaller HIV reservoir size. The HLA \"protective\" B*57:01 was associated with significantly lower HIV usRNA (q=3.3x10-3), and among the largest subgroup, European ancestry individuals, the CCR5{Delta}32 deletion was associated with smaller HIV tDNA (p=4.3x10-3) and usRNA (p=8.7x10-3). In addition, genomewide analysis identified several SNPs in MX1 (an interferon stimulated gene) that were significantly associated with HIV tDNA (q=0.02), and the direction of these associations paralleled MX1 gene eQTL expression.\n\nConclusionsWe observed a significant association between previously reported \"protective\" MHC class I alleles and CCR5{Delta}32 with the HIV reservoir size in non-controllers. We also found a novel association between MX1 and HIV total DNA (in addition to other interferon signaling relevant genes, PPP1CB, DDX3X). These findings warrant further investigation in future validation studies.",

We observed a coordinated intercellular regulatory program which enriched for genes related to inflammation and lipid-processing across multiple cell types as glucose intolerance increased.

    "abstract": "Computational modelling of biological processes poses multiple challenges in each stage of the modelling exercise. Some significant challenges include identifiability, precisely estimating parameters from limited data, informative experiments and anisotropic sensitivity in the parameter space. One of these challenges crucial but inconspicuous sources is the possible presence of large regions in the parameter space over which model predictions are nearly identical. This property, known as sloppiness, has been reasonably well-addressed in the past decade, studying its possible impacts and remedies. However, certain critical unanswered questions concerning sloppiness, particularly related to its quantification and practical implications in various stages of system identification, still prevail. In this work, we systematically examine sloppiness at a fundamental level and formalise two new theoretical definitions of sloppiness. Using the proposed definitions, we establish a mathematical relationship between the parameter estimates precision and sloppiness in linear predictors. Further, we develop a novel computational method and a visual tool to assess the goodness of a model around a point in parameter space by identifying local structural identifiability and sloppiness and finding the most sensitive and least sensitive parameters for non-infinitesimal perturbations. We demonstrate the working of our method in benchmark systems biology models of various complexities. The pharmacokinetic HIV infection model analysis identified a new set of biologically relevant parameters that can be used to control the free virus in an active HIV infection.\n\nAuthor summary",

The binding between antibodies and antigens is mainly determined by the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of the antibodies. In this work, we develop a deep generative model that jointly models sequences and structures of CDRs based on diffusion probabilistic models and equivariant neural networks. Our method is the first deep learning-based method that generates antibodies explicitly targeting specific antigen structures and is one of the earliest diffusion probabilistic models for protein structures. The model is a \"Swiss Army Knife\" capable of sequence-structure co-design, sequence design for given backbone structures, and antibody optimization. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the quality of both sequences and structures of designed antibodies. We find that our model could yield competitive results in binding affinity measured by biophysical energy functions and other protein design metrics.",

    "abstract": "Incompatibilities on the sex chromosomes are important in the evolution of hybrid male sterility, but the evolutionary forces underlying this phenomenon are unclear. House mice (Mus musculus) lineages have provided powerful models for understanding the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility. X chromosome-autosome interactions cause strong incompatibilities in Mus musculus F1 hybrids, but variation in sterility phenotypes suggests a more complex genetic basis. Additionally, XY chromosome conflict has resulted in rapid expansions of ampliconic genes with dosage-dependent expression that is essential to spermatogenesis. Here we evaluated the contribution of XY lineage mismatch to male fertility and stage-specific gene expression in hybrid mice. We performed backcrosses between two house mouse subspecies to generate reciprocal Y-introgression strains and used these strains to test the effects of XY mismatch in hybrids. Our transcriptome analyses of sorted spermatid cells revealed widespread overexpression of the X chromosome in sterile F1 hybrids independent of Y chromosome subspecies origin. Thus, postmeiotic overexpression of the X chromosome in sterile F1 mouse hybrids is likely a downstream consequence of disrupted meiotic X-inactivation rather than XY gene copy number imbalance. Y-chromosome introgression did result in subfertility phenotypes and disrupted expression of several autosomal genes in mice with an otherwise nonhybrid genomic background, suggesting that Y-linked incompatibilities contribute to reproductive barriers, but likely not as a direct consequence of XY conflict. Collectively, these findings suggest that rapid sex chromosome gene family evolution driven by genomic conflict has not resulted in strong male reproductive barriers between these subspecies of house mice.",

    "abstract": "The projected increase in warming and drought severity (i.e., hotter and drier summers) in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) may negatively impact grassland plant composition and ecosystem function, with further implications for sustainable land management in the region. To test the vulnerability of Mediterranean grassland function to climate change, we quantified the response of grassland communities to multiannual warming (+2.5{degrees}C) and drought (-40% precipitation) by quantifying plant species diversity, legume cover, and biogeochemical controls on and patterns of soil asymbiotic nitrogen fixation (ANF). We hypothesized that the effects of warming on plant functional diversity would increase soil ANF inputs by decreasing legume cover and soil nitrogen availability. Given that asymbiotic N fixers can increase soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability under drought, we hypothesized that the effect of drought on grassland plant cover correlated with increased soil ANF. We surveyed the vegetation and collected composite soil samples from five co-located plots under control (ambient), drought and warming conditions during the fall and spring seasons. In control and drought plots, we quantified the moderator effect of plant composition by comparing low-diversity (unmanipulated plant composition) and high-diversity (manipulated composition) grassland plots. We used a point intercept technique to survey plot-level plant community composition and calculate Shannons diversity index and percent cover of legumes (members of Fabaceae according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System). We measured ANF by incubating collected soils with N-labeled dinitrogen (15N2), and quantified total soil C, total and available N, available phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) pools, pH, and soil water holding capacity. Plant species diversity decreased significantly with warming and along the drought severity gradient. ANF response to warming varied by season and site, with rates increasing along the drought severity gradient in the fall but decreasing in the spring. Total soil inorganic N was the strongest predictor of ANF response to warming in the spring but not in the fall. Soil ANF response to drought increased with drought intensity; while soil ANF increased nearly twofold in the southernmost (warm and dry) site, ANF decreased in the northernmost (cool and wet) site. ANF response to drought also varied depending on plant diversity, where low-diversity grasslands had more predictable response to drought than high-diversity grasslands. Soil P availability and pH were the most important variables explaining ANF variability across vegetation types and sites. Our study highlights the importance of using soil-plant-atmosphere interactions to assess grassland ecosystem resilience to drought and warming in the PNW.",

By combining the techniques of latent variable analysis and SINDy, we infer key aspects of the interaction dynamics of CAR T-cell populations and cancer.

We show how this data-driven model-discovery based approach provides unique insight into CAR T-cell dynamics when compared to an established model-first approach.

    "abstract": "Sex chromosome dosage compensation is a model to understand the coordinated regulation of transcription, however the advanced age of the sex chromosomes in model systems make it difficult to study how the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying chromosome-wide dosage compensation can evolve. The sex chromosomes of Poecilia picta have undergone recent and rapid divergence, resulting in widespread gene loss on the male Y, coupled with complete X chromosome dosage compensation, the first case reported in a fish. The de novo origin of a novel dosage compensation system presents a unique opportunity to discover new mechanisms of gene regulation and their evolutionary origins. By combining a new chromosome-level assembly of P. picta with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-Seq data, we determine that the binding motif of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is associated with male hypomethylated regions on the X, but not the autosomes. The male-specific hypomethylation of these motifs offers a putative model for male specific upregulation of genes on the X. These YY1 motifs are the result of a recent and rapid repetitive element expansion on the P. picta X chromosome, which is absent in closely related species that lack dosage compensation. Taken together, our results present compelling support that a disruptive wave of repetitive element insertions carrying YY1 motifs resulted in the remodeling of the X chromosome epigenomic landscape and the de novo origin of a new dosage compensation mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Several previous lines of research have suggested, indirectly, that mouse lifespan is particularly susceptible to endocrine or nutritional signals in the first few weeks of life, as tested by manipulations of litter size, growth hormone levels, or mutations with effects specifically on early-life growth rate. The pace of early development in mice can also be influenced by exposure of nursing and weanling mice to olfactory cues. In particular, odors of same-sex adult mice can in some circumstances delay maturation. We hypothesized that olfactory information might also have a sex-specific effect on lifespan, and we show here that lifespan of female mice can be increased significantly by odors from adult females administered transiently, i.e. from 3 days until 60 days of age. Female lifespan was not modified by male odors, nor was male lifespan susceptible to odors from adults of either sex. Conditional deletion of the G protein Go in the olfactory system, which leads to impaired accessory olfactory system function and blunted reproductive priming responses to male odors in females, did not modify the effect of female odors on female lifespan. Our data provide support for the idea that very young mice are susceptible to influences that can have long-lasting effects on disease resistance, and provide the first example of lifespan extension by olfactory cues in mice.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of single cell transcriptomics has revolutionized the study of complex tissues. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can profile tens-of-thousands of dissociated cells from a tissue sample, enabling researchers to identify cell types, phenotypes and interactions that control tissue structure and function. A key requirement of these applications is the accurate estimation of cell surface protein abundance. Although technologies to directly quantify surface proteins are available, this data is uncommon and limited to proteins with available antibodies. While supervised methods that are trained on Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) data can provide the best performance, this training data is also limited by available antibodies and may not exist for the tissue under investigation. In the absence of protein measurements, researchers must estimate receptor abundance from scRNA-seq data. We thereby developed a new unsupervised method for receptor abundance estimation using scRNA-seq data called SPECK (Surface Protein abundance Estimation using CKmeans-based clustered thresholding) and evaluated its performance against other unsupervised approaches on up to 215 human receptors and multiple tissue types. This analysis reveals that techniques based on a thresholded reduced rank reconstruction (RRR) of scRNA-seq data are effective for receptor abundance estimation with SPECK providing the best overall performance.",

    "abstract": "Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are highly evolved obligate parasites that threaten global food security. These parasites have a remarkable ability to establish elaborate feeding sites in roots, which are their only source of nutrients throughout their life cycle. A wide range of nematode effectors have been implicated in modulation of host pathways for feeding site development. Plants produce a diverse array of peptide hormones including plant peptides containing sulfated tyrosine (PSYs), which promote root growth via cell expansion and proliferation. A sulfated PSY-like peptide RaxX (required for activation of XA21 mediated immunity X) produced by the biotrophic bacterial pathogen (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), has been previously shown to contribute to bacterial virulence. Here, we report the identification of genes from root-knot nematodes predicted to encode PSY-like peptides (MigPSYs) with high sequence similarity to both bacterial RaxX and plant PSYs. Sulfated synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted MigPSYs stimulate root growth in Arabidopsis. MigPSY transcript levels are highest early in the infection cycle. Down-regulation of MigPSY gene expression reduces root galling and egg production, suggesting that the MigPSYs serve as nematode virulence factors. Together these results indicate that nematodes and bacteria utilize similar sulfated peptides to hijack plant developmental signaling pathways to facilitate parasitism.",

    "abstract": "A high concentration of oxalate is associated with an increased risk of kidney calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, and the degradation of exogenous oxalate mainly depends on oxalate-degrading enzymes from the intestinal microbiome. We found that Zinc Gluconate supplement to patients with CaOx kidney stones could significantly improve the abundance of oxalate metabolizing bacteria in human body through clinical experiments on the premise of simultaneous antibiotic treatment and the imbalance of Lactobacillus and OxDC was involved in CaOx kidney stones through clinical sample analysis. Then, we identified that Zn2+ could be used as an external factor to improve the activity of OxDC and protect Lactobacillus, achieved the preventive effect on rats with stones aggravated by antibiotics. Finally, by analyzing the three-dimensional structure of OxDC and some in vitro experiments, we propose a hypothesis Zn2+ increases the metabolism of oxalate in humans through its positive effects on Lactobacillus and OxDC to reduce CaOx kidney stone symptoms in rats.\n\nIMPORTANCEUrinary stone disease is one of the most common urological disorders, and 70%-80% of urinary stones are calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones. We found the structural basis and metabolic mechanism by which oxalate decarboxylase metabolizes oxalate were elucidated, and Zn2+ was illustrated to have therapeutic effects on CaOx stones by improving the tolerance of Lactobacillus to antibiotics. According to that, proper Zn2+ levels in the diet, the consumption of more probiotic food and avoidance of the antibiotic overuse might be desirable measures for the prevention and treatment of kidney stones.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/512337v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d3df85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7b3f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147d861org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cf046e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, in Cnidaria, the roles of {beta}-catenin signalling in both these processes have not been proven directly. Here, by tagging the endogenous {beta}-catenin protein in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, we show that the oral-aboral axis in a cnidarian is indeed patterned by a gradient of {beta}-catenin signalling. Unexpectedly, in a striking contrast to Bilateria, Nematostella endoderm specification takes place opposite to the part of the embryo, where {beta}-catenin is translocated into the nuclei. This suggests that {beta}-catenin-dependent endomesoderm specification is a Bilateria-specific co-option, which may have linked endomesoderm specification with the subsequent posterior-anterior patterning.",

    "abstract": "Rising temperatures and increasing temperature variability are impacting the range and prevalence of mosquito-borne disease. A promising biocontrol technology replaces wild mosquitoes with those carrying the virus-blocking Wolbachia bacterium. Laboratory and field observations show that the most widely used strain, wMel, is adversely affected by heat stress. Here, we examine whether and how climate warming may impact wMel-based replacement. We integrate empirical data on the temperature sensitivity of wMel bacteria into a mechanistic model of population dynamics for the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and use CMIP5 climate projections and historical temperature records from Cairns, Australia to simulate vector control interventions. We show that higher mean temperatures are predicted to lower wMel infection frequency and that extended heatwaves have the potential to reverse the public health benefits of this intervention. Sensitivity analysis probing the thermal limits of wMel replacement reveal that, under existing projections, operational adaptations would be required for heatwaves lasting longer than two weeks. We conclude that this technology is expected to be robust to both the increased mean temperatures and heatwaves associated with near-term climate change in temperate regions. However, more rapid warming or tropical and inland regions that presently feature hotter baselines may challenge these tested limits, requiring further research.",

Decades of theoretical studies have suggested a plausible evolutionary pathway to a primitive chromosome from replicating RNA molecules that harbor cooperative genes within a protocell structure. However, demonstrating the evolution of a primitive chromosome in an experimental setup is challenging. We previously developed a cooperative RNA replication system in which two types of RNAs co-replicate using their self-encoded replication and metabolic enzymes. Using this system, in the present study, we demonstrate the evolution of a linkage between the two cooperative RNA replicators in compartments. An evolved \"linked\" RNA harbored the entire region of both genes, accumulated distinct mutations, and retained the ability to replicate using the two proteins translated from itself. These experimental findings support a prebiotic evolutionary scenario, in which unlinked genes assembled into a single genomic structure.",

Decades of theoretical studies have suggested a plausible evolutionary pathway to a primitive chromosome from replicating RNA molecules that harbor cooperative genes within a protocell structure. However, demonstrating the evolution of a primitive chromosome in an experimental setup is challenging. We previously developed a cooperative RNA replication system in which two types of RNAs co-replicate using their self-encoded replication and metabolic enzymes. Using this system, in the present study, we demonstrate the evolution of a linkage between the two cooperative RNA replicators in compartments. An evolved \"linked\" RNA harbored the entire region of both genes, accumulated distinct mutations, and retained the ability to replicate using the two proteins translated from itself. These experimental findings support a prebiotic evolutionary scenario, in which unlinked genes assembled into a single genomic structure.",

    "abstract": "The topological state of chromosomes is an important factor controlling their mechanical properties, dynamics and function. Recent work has shown that interphase chromosomes are largely free of entanglements. How cycling cells establish this state from a dense mitotic chromosome and maintain it through interphase in the presence of Topoisomerase II activity remains mysterious. Using multi-contact 3C, Hi-C, and polymer simulations, we find that mitotic chromosomes are intrachromosomally entangled, while interphase chromosomes are not, pointing to cell cycle-dependent control of chromosome topology. The majority of mitotic entanglements are removed during anaphase/telophase, with most of the remaining ones removed during early G1, in a process that requires Topoisomerase II. Polymer simulations show that swelling and decondensation of mitotic chromosomes during mitotic exit produce entropic forces that bias Topoisomerase II activity towards decatenation of condensin loops. This is followed by prevention of formation of new entanglements by lower Topoisomerase II activity in G1, and, in heterochromatic B compartments, by interplay between cohesin and Topoisomerase II. Our results show how cells control chromosome topology during mitotic exit and G1 employing both biophysical and molecular mechanisms to modulate Topoisomerase II activity and directionality.",

    "abstract": "By decomposing genome sequences into k-mers, it is possible to estimate genome differences without alignment. Techniques such as k-mer minimisers (MinHash), have been developed and are often accurate approximations of distances based on full k-mer sets. These and other alignment-free methods avoid the large temporal and computational expense of alignment or mapping. However, these k-mer set comparisons are not entirely accurate within-species and can be completely inaccurate within-lineage. This is due, in part, to their inability to distinguish core polymorphism from accessory differences. Here we present a new approach, KmerAperture, which uses information on the k-mer relative genomic positions to determine the type of polymorphism causing differences in k-mer presence and absence between pairs of genomes. Single SNPs are expected to result in contiguous series of relative unique k-mers of length L= k. On the other hand, series of length L > k may be caused by accessory differences of length L-k+1; when the start and end of the sequence are contiguous with homologous sequence. Alternatively, they may be caused by multiple SNPs within k bp from each other and KmerAperture can determine whether that is the case. To demonstrate use cases KmerAperture was benchmarked using datasets including a very low diversity simulated population with accessory content independent from the number of SNPs, a simulated population were SNPs are spatially dense, a moderately diverse real cluster of genomes (Escherichia coli ST1193) with a large accessory genome and a low diversity real genome cluster (Salmonella Typhimurium ST34). We show that KmerAperture can accurately distinguish both core and accessory sequence diversity without alignment, outperforming other k-mer based tools.",

A fifth R-M gene was replaced by a selectable marker to create a final D. radiodurans strain with 5 of the 6 putative R-M systems deleted.

    "abstract": "Lithium (Li) is a widely used as a mood stabilizer in the clinical management of Bipolar Affective Disorder (BPAD). However, the molecular targets of Li in neural cells that underpin its therapeutic effect remain unresolved. Inositol monophosphatase (IMPA1), is an enzyme involved in the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) following receptor-activated phospholipase C (PLC) signalling. In vitro, Li inhibits IMPA1, but the relevance of this inhibition within neural cells remains unknown. Here we report that in human cells, treatment with therapeutically relevant concentrations of Li reduces receptor activated calcium release from intracellular stores and delays the resynthesis of PIP2 following receptor activated PLC signalling. Both these effects of Li are abrogated in cells where IMPA1 has been deleted. We also observed that in human forebrain cortical neurons, treatment with Li results in reduced neuronal excitability as well as reduced calcium signals following receptor activated PLC signalling. Following Li treatment of human forebrain cortical neurons, transcriptome analyses reveal downregulation of multiple components of the glutamate receptor signalling system. Glutamate is a key excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain and thus our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying the dampening of neuronal excitability following Li treatment. Collectively, our findings suggest that Li inhibits receptor activated PLC signalling leading to an altered transcriptional response and reduced neuronal excitability.",

We therefore examined longitudinal transcriptional and epigenetic changes in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a disease characterised by temporal fluctuations in lung infection and inflammation. We find that sudden clinical deteriorations in lung health, termed Acute Pulmonary Exacerbations (APEs), are linked to a robust innate immune response (triggered in part by pattern recognition receptor (PRR) activation) and associated changes in phagocytic function. Treatment of patients with intravenous antibiotics results in rapid modification of myeloid cell gene expression and epigenetic state, towards that of healthy volunteers, and suggests that CF inflammatory lung damage is driven by repeated acute inflammatory episodes rather than a distinct chronic inflammatory programme.",

    "abstract": "Geographic differences in vocalisations provide strong evidence for animal culture, with patterns likely arising from generations of social learning and transmission. The current knowledge on the evolution of vocal variation has predominantly focused on fixed repertoire, territorial song in passerine birds. The study of vocal communication in open-ended learners and in contexts where vocalisations serve other functions is therefore necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of vocal dialect evolution. Parrots are open-ended vocal production learners that use vocalisations for social contact and coordination. Geographic variation in parrot vocalisations typically take the form of either distinct regional variations known as dialects or graded variation based on geographic distance known as clinal variation. In this study, we recorded monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) across multiple spatial scales (i.e. parks and cities) in their European invasive range. We then compared calls using a multi-level Bayesian model and sensitivity analysis, with this novel approach allowing us to explicitly compare vocalisations at multiple spatial scales. We found support for founder effects and/or cultural drift at the city level, consistent with passive cultural processes leading to large scale dialect differences. We did not find a strong signal for dialect or clinal differences between parks within cities, suggesting that birds did not actively converge on a group level signal, as expected under the group membership hypothesis. We demonstrate the robustness of our findings and offer an explanation that unifies the results of prior monk parakeet vocalisation studies.",

    "abstract": "Studies on parasite biogeography and host spectrum provide insights into the processes driving parasite diversification. Global geographical distribution and a multi-host spectrum make the tapeworm Ligula intestinalis a promising model for studying both the vicariant and ecological modes of speciation in parasites. To understand the relative importance of host association and biogeography in the evolutionary history of this tapeworm, we analysed mtDNA and reduced-represented genomic SNP data for a total of 139 specimens collected from 18 fish-host genera across a distribution range representing 21 countries. Our results strongly supported the existence of at least 10 evolutionary lineages and estimated the deepest divergence at approximately 4.99-5.05 Mya, which is much younger than the diversification of the fish host genera and orders. Historical biogeography analyses revealed that the ancestor of the parasite diversified following multiple vicariance events and was widespread throughout the Palearctic, Afrotropical, and Nearctic between the late Miocene and early Pliocene. Cyprinoids were inferred as the ancestral hosts for the parasite. Later, from the late Pliocene to Pleistocene, new lineages emerged following a series of biogeographic dispersal and host-switching events. Although only a few of the current Ligula lineages show narrow host-specificity (to a single host genus), almost no host genera, even those that live in sympatry, overlapped between different Ligula lineages. Our analyses uncovered the impact of historical distribution shifts on host switching and the evolution of host specificity without parallel host-parasite co-speciation. Historical biogeography reconstructions also found that the parasite colonized several areas (Afrotropical and Australasian) much earlier than was suggested by only recent faunistic data.",

Mutations in the SMCHD1 gene are linked to both minor cases with no prominent repeat loss (FSHD2) and severe cases of FSHD1. Abnormal upregulation of the transcription factor DUX4, encoded in the D4Z4 repeat, is believed to play a central role in FSHD. However, defining the disease mechanism has been hampered by the heterogeneity of patient-derived cells, difficulty to detect DUX4 in patient myocytes, and limited animal models because D4Z4 repeats are primate-specific. To overcome these limitations, we engineered isogenic human skeletal myoblast lines with D4Z4 and/or SMCHD1 mutations. We found a highly synergistic effect of double mutations on triggering two key disease processes, D4Z4 heterochromatin disruption and cross-stimulation of DUX4 targets, such as histone H3.X/Y and LEUTX transcription factor. Thus, engineered human myocyte models provide unique insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning FSHD.\n\nTeaserFSHD mutations cause D4Z4 heterochromatin disruption and feedforward DUX4 network activation.",

In addition, we show here that Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA complexed to LNPs were able to edit the fetal organs in utero after an intrahepatic injection. These experiments demonstrate the possibility of non-viral delivery of gene editing enzymes in utero and nanoparticle drug delivery has great potential for delivering macromolecules to organs outside of the liver in utero, which provides a promising strategy for treating a wide variety of devastating genetic diseases before birth.",

For a long time, histones are observed to exist in the unit of dimers but diverge into different formats such as heterodimers in Eukarya or homodimers in Archaea. Here, by studying 11 types of histone proteins, both monomers and their dimeric complexes, using multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with NMR and circular dichroism experiments, we confirm the widely applied \"folding upon binding\" mechanism of histone structures. A histone dimer appears to form the longest 2 helices followed by other shorter helices and inter-molecular tertiary structures. We report an alternative conformation, namely, the inverted non-native dimer, which has a minimum free energy state. Protein sequence analysis indicates that the inverted conformation can be attributed to a hidden head-tail sequence symmetry underlying all histone proteins. This finding strongly support previously proposed histone evolution hypotheses. Finally, we separately used the MD-based AWSEM and AI-based AlphaFold-Multimer model to predict eukaryotic histone homodimer structures and performed extensive allatom MD simulations to examine their structural stabilities. Our results suggest that eukaryotic histones can also form stable homodimers, whereas their disordered tails-- the structurally asymmetrical region--may tip the balance towards the formation of heterotypic dimers.",

We find that when assembling subunits preferentially partition into liquid domains, robustness against kinetic traps and maximum achievable assembly rates can be significantly increased. In particular, the range of solution conditions over which productive assembly and the corresponding assembly rates can increase by orders of magnitude. We analyze the rate equation predictions using simple scaling estimates to identify effect of liquid-liquid phase separation as a function of relevant control parameters.

In this study, we image and quantitatively analyze the contractile kinematics observed in two ciliated protists (Vorticella sp and Spirostomum sp), and, based on the mechanochemistry of these organisms, we propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces our observations as well as those published previously. Analyzing the model reveals three distinct dynamic regimes, differentiated by the rate of chemical driving and the importance of inertia.

    "abstract": "Chyawanprash is a rich source of all the major bioactive metabolites because of its authentic and natural composition and widely used due to its medicinal properties. In the present study, the precise flow of analytical methods was employed for the identification and characterization of unknown secondary metabolites in Chyawanprash. The phytochemical components of the whole formulation were extracted using n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol by maceration which shows the presence of all the major secondary metabolite components through preliminary qualitative phytochemical screening. The GC-MS analysis of different extracts of Chyawanprash was investigated using Clarus 680 GC (Perkin-Elmer (U. S. A) 30 m X 0.25 mm ID X 250 m DF) which revealed the presence of total 15 unknown secondary metabolites. Finally, the results showed that the study forms the basis for the phytochemical characterization of Chyawanprash extracts, the isolation of responsible bio-active metabolites and their biological activity is necessary for future studies.",

In this paper, we used a computational model that simulates the metabolism of mature plants to test how the use of nitrate and ammonium as nitrogen sources affects plant metabolism. Our model predicted and showed the possible changes in metabolism in different plant tissues in response to the use of different nitrogen sources. Our methodology produces predictions of metabolic fluxes in plants and improves our understanding of how plants react to changes in conditions. This research can potentially give insights into how we can improve crop yield by identifying metabolic processes that are important in plant growth and in the adaptation to different nitrogen sources. In future research work, we can apply the existing model to explore the effects of different nutrient availability under different conditions (e.g. well-watered vs drought) to optimize nutrient availability under particular environmental conditions. Experimental researchers, plant breeders, and farmers can use the knowledge gained from the modeling work to further our understanding of plant metabolism and apply the knowledge to improve plant growth in the lab and the field.",

The efficacy of VECTRON T500, a wettable powder formulation of broflanilide, was assessed for IRS against wild pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors in experimental huts in Benin.\n\nMethodsVECTRON T500 was evaluated at 100 mg/m{superscript 2} in mud and cement-walled experimental huts against wild pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) in Cove, southern Benin, over 18 months. A direct comparison was made with Actellic(R) 300CS, a WHO-recommended micro-encapsulated formulation of pirimiphos-methyl, applied at 1000 mg/m{superscript 2}. The vector population at Cove was investigated for susceptibility to broflanilide and other classes of insecticides used for vector control. Monthly wall cone bioassays were performed to assess the residual efficacy of VECTRON T500 using insecticide susceptible An. gambiae Kisumu and pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s.l. Cove strains. The study complied with OECD principles of good laboratory practice.\n\nResultsThe vector population at Cove was resistant to pyrethroids and organochlorines but susceptible to broflanilide and pirimiphos-methyl. A total of 23,171 free-flying wild pyrethroid-resistant female An. gambiae s.l. were collected in the experimental huts over 12 months. VECTRON T500 induced 56%-60% mortality in wild vector mosquitoes in both cement and mud-walled huts. Mortality with VECTRON T500 was 62%-73% in the first three months and remained >50% for 9 months on both substrate-types. By comparison, mortality with Actellic(R) 300CS was very high in the first three months (72%-95%) but declined sharply to <40% after 4 months. Using a non-inferiority margin defined by the World Health Organization, overall mortality achieved with VECTRON T500 was non-inferior to that observed in huts treated with Actellic(R) 300CS with both cement and mud wall substrates. Monthly in situ wall cone bioassay mortality with VECTRON T500 also remained over 80 % for 18 months but dropped below 80% with Actellic(R) 300CS at 6-7 months post spraying.\n\nConclusionVECTRON T500 shows potential to provide substantial and prolonged control of malaria transmitted by pyrethroid-resistant mosquito vectors when applied for IRS. Its addition to the current list of WHO-approved IRS insecticides will provide a suitable option to facilitate rotation of IRS products with different modes of action.",

    "abstract": "Allosterically modulated free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2R/GPR43) can be activated without the involvement of any orthosteric FFA2R agonist, by signals generated for example by P2Y2R, the G protein coupled receptor for ATP. An FFA2R specific positive allosteric modulator (PAM; Cmp58) was used to disclose the molecular mechanism by which signals generated by ATP/P2Y2R transactivates FFA2R. The P2Y2R induced signal that transactivates the allosterically modulated FFA2R was generated downstream of the Gq containing G protein that couple to P2Y2R. A receptor induced rise in the cytosolic concentration of ionized calcium ([Ca2+]i) was hypothesized to be the receptor transactivation signal. The Gq dependent transient rise in [Ca2+]i induced by the ATP activated P2Y2Rs was not affected by Cmp58. The hypothesis gained, however, support from the finding that the modulator transferred FFA2R to a Ca2+ sensitive state. The rise in [Ca2+]i induced by the Ca2+ specific ionophore ionomycin, activated the allosterically modulated FFA2R. The response induced by ionomycin was rapidly terminated and the FFA2Rs could then no longer be activated by the orthosteric FFA2R agonist propionate or be transactivated by the signal generated by the activated ATP receptor. The desensitized/non-responding state of FFA2R was, however, revoked by an earlier described cross-sensitizing/activating allosteric FFA2R modulator. The receptor transactivation of the allosterically modulated FFA2Rs, represent a unique regulatory receptor cross-talk mechanism by which the activity of a G protein coupled receptor is controlled by a signaling system operating from the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane.\n\nOne-sentence summaryA P2Y2 receptor signal generated downstream of a Gq containing G protein transactivates the allosterically modulated FFA2 receptor",

Here we describe a strategy for overcoming major bottlenecks in the cloning of the powdery mildew (Pm) resistance gene (R-gene) Pm69 derived from tetraploid wild emmer wheat (WEW). A conventional positional cloning approach encountered suppressed recombination due to structural variations, while chromosome sorting yielded an insufficient purity level. A Pm69 physical map, constructed by assembling ONT long-read genome sequences, revealed a rapidly evolving nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) R-gene cluster. A single candidate NLR was identified within this cluster by anchoring RNASeq reads of susceptible mutants to ONT contigs and was validated by the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach. Pm69, comprising Rx_N with RanGAP interaction sites, NB-ARC, and LRR domains, is probably a newly evolved NLR discovered only in one location across the WEW distribution range in the Fertile Crescent. Pm69 was successfully introgressed into durum and bread wheat, and a diagnostic molecular marker could be used to accelerate its deployment and pyramiding with other resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "The auxin-inducible degradation system has been widely adopted in the C. elegans research community for its ability to empirically control the spatiotemporal expression of target proteins. This system can efficiently degrade auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins via the expression of a ligand-activatable AtTIR1 protein derived from A. thaliana that adapts target proteins to the endogenous C. elegans proteosome. While broad expression of AtTIR1 using strong, ubiquitous promoters can lead to rapid degradation of AID-tagged proteins, cell type-specific expression of AtTIR1 using spatially restricted promoters often results in less efficient target protein degradation. To circumvent this limitation, we have developed a FLP/FRT3-based system that functions to reanimate a dormant, high-powered promoter that can drive sufficient AtTIR1expression in a cell type-specific manner. We benchmark the utility of this system by generating a number of tissue specific FLP-ON::TIR1 drivers to reveal genetically separable cell type-specific phenotypes for several target proteins. We also demonstrate that the FLP-ON::TIR1 system is compatible with enhanced degron epitopes. Finally, we provide an expandable toolkit utilizing the basic FLP-ON::TIR1 system that can be adapted to drive optimized AtTIR1expression in any tissue or cell type of interest.",

    "abstract": "Antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are loops within antibodies responsible for engaging antigens during the immune response and in antibody therapeutics and laboratory reagents. Since the 1980s, the conformations of the hypervariable CDRs have been structurally classified into a number of \"canonical conformations\" by Chothia, Lesk, Thornton, and others. In 2011 (North et al, J Mol Biol. 2011), we produced a quantitative clustering of approximately 300 structures of each CDR based on their length, a dihedral angle metric, and an affinity propagation algorithm. The data have been made available on our PyIgClassify website since 2015 and have been widely used in assigning conformational labels to antibodies in new structures and in molecular dynamics simulations. In the years since, it is has become apparent that many of the clusters are not \"canonical\" since they have not grown in size and still contain few sequences. Some clusters represent multiple conformations, given the assignment method we have used since 2015. Electron density calculations indicate that some clusters are due to misfitting of coordinates to electron density. In this work, we have performed a new statistical clustering of antibody CDR conformations. We used Electron Density in Atoms (EDIA, Meyder et al., 2017) to produce data sets with different levels of electron density validation. Clusters were chosen by their presence in high electron density cutoff data sets and with sufficient sequences ([&ge;]10) across the entire PDB (no EDIA cutoff). About half of the North et al. clusters have been \"retired\" and 13 new clusters have been identified. We also include clustering of the H4 and L4 CDRs, otherwise known as the \"DE loop\" which connects strands D and E of the variable domain. The DE loop sometimes contacts antigens and affects the structure of neighboring CDR1 and CDR2 loops. The current database contains 6,486 PDB antibody entries. The new clustering will be useful in the analysis and development of new antibody structure prediction and design algorithms based on rapidly emerging techniques in deep learning. The new clustering data are available at http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/PyIgClassify2.",

Exome sequencing of two independent cohorts of IHH patients identified 12 rare missense variants in POU6F2. POU6F2 encodes two distinct isoforms. In mouse, pituitary and gonads expressed both isoforms, but only isoform1 was detected in GnRH cells. Although the function of isoform2 is well known, using bioinformatics and cells assays on a human-derived GnRH cell line, we demonstrate isoform1 can also act as a transcriptional regulator, decreasing GNRH1 expression. The impact of two POU6F2 variants (MT1 and MT2) was then examined. MT1, but not MT2, reduced transcriptional activity of either isoform, preventing Hes5 promoter activation by isoform2 and repression of GnRH transcripts by isoform1. GnRH transcription increases as the cells migrate into the brain. Augmentation earlier can disrupt normal GnRH cell migration, consistent with POU6F2 variants contributing to IHH pathogenesis.",

To improve aerotolerance and activity, we applied continuous directed evolution under aerobic conditions in the yeast OrthoRep system to two sulfide-dependent bacterial THI4s. Six beneficial single mutations were identified, of which five lie in the active-site cleft predicted by structural modeling and two recapitulate features of naturally aerotolerant THI4s. That single mutations gave substantial improvements suggests that further advance under selection will be possible by stacking mutations. This proof-of-concept study established that the performance of sulfide-dependent THI4s in aerobic conditions is evolvable and, more generally, that yeast OrthoRep provides a plant-like bridge to adapt nonplant enzymes to work better in plants.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is a human fungal pathogen that is most often avirulent in immune competent individuals because the innate immune system is efficient at eliminating fungal conidia. However, recent clinical observations have shown that severe Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can lead to secondary A. fumigatus infections with high mortality. Little is currently known about how IAV infection alters the innate antifungal immune response. Here, we established a murine model of IAV-induced A. fumigatus (IAV-Af) superinfection by inoculating mice with IAV followed 6 days later by A. fumigatus conidia challenge. We observed increased mortality in the IAV-Af superinfected mice compared to mice challenged with either IAV or A. fumigatus alone. A. fumigatus conidia were able to germinate and establish a biofilm in the lungs of the IAV-Af superinfection group, which was not seen following fungal challenge alone. While we did not observe any differences in inflammatory cell recruitment in the IAV-Af superinfection group compared to single infection controls, we observed defects in Aspergillus conidial uptake and killing by both neutrophils and monocytes after IAV infection. pHrodo-Zymosan and CM-H2DCFDA staining, indicators of phagolysosome maturation and ROS production, respectively, revealed that the fungal killing defect was due in part to reduced phagolysosome maturation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the ability of neutrophils and monocytes to kill and clear Aspergillus conidia is strongly reduced in the pulmonary environment of an IAV-infected lung, which leads to Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis and increased overall mortality in our mouse model recapitulating what is observed clinically in humans.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfluenza A virus (IAV) is a common respiratory virus that causes seasonal illness in humans, but can cause pandemics and severe infection in certain patients. Since the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strains, there has be an increase in clinical reports of IAV infected patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) developing secondary pulmonary aspergillosis. These cases of flu-Aspergillus superinfections are associated with worse clinical outcomes than secondary bacterial infections in the setting of IAV. To date, we have a limited understanding of the cause(s) of secondary fungal infections in immune competent hosts. IAV-induced modulation of cytokine production and innate immune cellular function generates a unique immune environment in the lung, which could make the host vulnerable to a secondary fungal infection. Our work shows that defects in phagolysosome maturation in neutrophils and monocytes after IAV infection impairs the ability of these cells to kill A. fumigatus thus leading to increased fungal germination and growth and subsequent invasive aspergillosis. Our work lays a foundation for future mechanistic studies examining the exact immune modulatory events occurring in the respiratory tract after viral infection leading to secondary fungal infections.",

    "abstract": "Deep sea hydrocarbon seep detection relies predominantly on geochemical analyses of seabed marine sediment cores to identify the presence of gas or oil. The presence of seeping hydrocarbons in these locations alters resident microbial community structure, leading to culture-based biodegradation assays as a complement to geochemical tools for seep detection. Biodiversity surveys of microbial communities can offer a similar proxy for seeping hydrocarbons, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated in deep water settings. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bacterial communities was performed on sediment cores obtained in >2500 m water depth at 43 different locations in the NW Atlantic Ocean. Core samples from as deep as 10 metres below seafloor (mbsf) were assessed for gas composition, gas isotopes and liquid hydrocarbons. Over 650 bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries were constructed from different sediment depths at these locations. Select sites showed strong evidence for the presence of thermogenic or biogenic hydrocarbons such that bacterial population analyses revealed significant differences between hydrocarbon seep and non-seep locations. Specific bacterial indicators were associated with different sediment depth intervals. Caldatribacteriota and Campilobacterota OTUs were observed in high relative sequence abundance in hydrocarbon seep sediments, particularly in the 20-50 cmbsf interval. Furthermore, these groups were differentially abundant between sites with thermogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons. The patterns revealed here suggest that microbial screening has the potential to play a key role in hydrocarbon seep detection and characterisation in remote deep-sea environments.",

We showed that IISS can be applied to both fresh frozen tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections for single cell level spatial gene expression analysis, based on which the developmental trajectory and cell-cell communication networks can also be constructed. In conclusion, our method is a versatile molecular tool for targeted spatial transcriptomic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Humidity sensing ability is crucial to terrestrial animals for fitting the environment. Researchers made great progress in recent study about humidity sensing mechanisms of terrestrial animals. However, it is poorly understood whether humidity sensing exists in aquatic animals. Here, we demonstrate that the aquatic planarians, one of the primitive forerunners of later animals, has the ability of humidity sensing and is capable of using the ability to perceive the water beneath itself from a drought place to seek survival. The behavior we discovered is described as diving because the worms twist its body to break away from the mucus that make them adhere to the drought place and drop into the water. The behavior is triggered by rapidly increasing humidity. This finding suggests that humidity sensing ability exists in the lower aquatic animals, and the ability might be used to seek for water when aquatic animals are facing desiccation. The finding also suggests that survival-seeking and decision-making behavior have appeared in the primitive planarian worms.",

    "abstract": "Robust oxygenic photosynthesis requires a suite of accessory factors to ensure efficient assembly and repair of the oxygen-evolving photosystem two (PSII) complex. The highly conserved Ycf48 assembly factor binds to the newly synthesized D1 reaction center polypeptide and promotes the initial steps of PSII assembly, but its binding site is unclear. Here we have used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of a cyanobacterial PSII D1/D2 reaction center assembly complex with Ycf48 attached. Ycf48, a 7-bladed beta propeller, binds to the amino-acid residues of D1 that ultimately ligate the Mn4CaO5 cluster that catalyzes water oxidation, thereby preventing the premature binding of Mn2+ and Ca2+ ions and protecting the site from damage. Interactions with D2 help explain how Ycf48 promotes assembly of the D1/D2 complex. Overall, our work provides new insights into the early stages of PSII assembly and the structural changes that create the binding site for the Mn4CaO5 cluster.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that hyperbolic geometry confers many advantages for analyzing hierarchical structure in complex systems. However, available embedding methods do not give a precise metric for determining the dimensionality of the data, and do not vary curvature. These parameters are important for obtaining accurate, low dimensional, continuous descriptions of the data. To address this we develop a Bayesian formulation of Multi-Dimensional Scaling for embedding data in hyperbolic spaces that can fit for the optimal values of geometric parameters such as curvature and dimension. We propose a novel model of embedding uncertainty within this Bayesian framework which improves both performance and interpretability of the model. Because the method allows for variable curvature, it can also correctly embed Euclidean data using zero curvature, thus subsuming traditional Euclidean MDS models. We demonstrate that only a small amount of data is needed to constrain the geometry in our model and that the model is robust against false minima when scaling to large datasets. We apply our model to real world datasets and uncover new insights into their hierarchical structure derived from our geometric embeddings.",

    "abstract": "In order to cope with the risk of stress-induced mutagenesis, cells in all kingdoms of life employ Y-family DNA polymerases to resolve resulting DNA lesions and thus maintaining the integrity of the genome. In Escherichia coli (E. coli) the DNA polymerase IV, or DinB, plays this crucial role in coping with these type of mutations via the so-called translesion DNA synthesis. Despite the availability of several high-resolution crystal structures important aspects of the functional repertoire of DinB remain elusive. In this study, we use advanced solution NMR spectroscopy methods in combination with biophysical characterization to elucidate the crucial role of the Thumb domain within DinBs functional cycle. We find that the inherent dynamics of this domain guide the recognition of double-stranded (ds) DNA buried within the interior of the DinB domain arrangement and trigger allosteric signals through the DinB protein. Subsequently, we characterized the RNA polymerase interaction with DinB, revealing an extended outside surface of DinB and thus not mutually excluding the DNA interaction. Altogether the obtained results lead to a refined model of the functional repertoire of DinB within the translesion DNA synthesis pathway.",

    "abstract": "Many of the biological structures that exist across the tree of life are built on self-interacting scaffolds, from the actin cytoskeleton to the collagen extracellular matrix. Intracellular membraneless organelles, such as the nucleolus, are biological structures consisting of hundreds of dynamically interacting components, yet it is unclear whether the underlying organization of these complex assemblies can be scaffolded by such self-interacting components. Here, we show that TCOF1 is a single-component scaffold of the nucleolar fibrillar center (FC), based on thermodynamics of its assembly in cells, as well as sufficiency and loss-of-function experiments. TCOF1 is necessary for the formation of the FC, and defines the FC through assembly mediated by homotypic interactions of its Serine/Glutamate (S/E)-rich low-complexity regions (LCRs). Ultimately, introduction of TCOF1 into a species that lacks the FC is sufficient to form an FC-like nucleolar subcompartment. Thus, we demonstrate how a single protein component can explain the formation and evolution of a complex biological structure.",

The objective was to explore Lens species and/or accessions that could contribute higher biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) ability to the lentil crop. A split plot design was used with either Rhizobium inoculation, added Nitrogen (N) or neither, as the main plots, and accessions in subplots randomized in blocks. Two repeats of the experiment were evaluated at flowering for N fixation and nodulation characters, and two subsequent experiments, with a subset of 14 accessions, were evaluated at maturity for seed production, seed quality and harvest index. Differences in phenotypic expression did not correspond to any particular Lens species. CDC Greenstar exhibited some of the highest N fixation values observed among the cultivars and also superior yield results compared to the added N treatment. Wild accessions, including IG 72643 (L. orientalis), displayed unique and multiple desirable characteristics compared to cultivars including indeterminate nodulation, higher N translocation, stable yield compared to added N treatment and exceptionally high protein concentration in seeds.",

    "abstract": "Males and females show differential patterns in connectivity in resting-state networks (RSNs) during normal aging, from early adulthood to late middle age. Age-related differences in network integration (effectiveness of specialized communication at the global network level) and segregation (functional specialization at the local level of specific brain regions) may also differ by sex. These differences may be due at least in part to endogenous hormonal fluctuation, such as that which occurs in females during midlife with the transition to menopause when levels of estrogens and progesterone drop markedly. A limited number of studies that have investigated sex differences in the action of steroid hormones in brain networks. Here we investigated how sex steroid hormones relate to age-network relationships in both males and females, with a focus on network segregation. Females displayed a significant quadratic relationship between age and network segregation for the cerebellar-basal ganglia and salience networks. In both cases, segregation was still increasing through adulthood, highest in midlife, and with a downturn thereafter. However, there were no significant relationships between sex steroid hormone levels and network segregation levels in females, and they did not exhibit significant associations between progesterone or 17{beta}-estradiol and network segregation. Patterns of connectivity between the cerebellum and basal ganglia have been associated with cognitive performance and self-reported balance confidence in older adults. Together, these findings suggest that network segregation patterns with age in females vary by network, and that sex steroid hormones are not associated with this measure of connectivity in this cross-sectional analysis. Though this is a null effect, it remains critical for understanding the extent to which hormones relate to brain network architecture.",

Neuroinflammation specifically induced by -syn has been shown to exacerbate neurodegeneration, yet the role of CNS resident macrophages in this process remains unclear. We found that a specific subset of CNS resident macrophages, border-associated macrophages (BAMs), play an essential role in mediating -syn related neuroinflammation due to their unique role as the antigen presenting cells necessary to initiate a CD4 T cell response. Surprisingly, the loss of MHCII antigen presentation on microglia had no effect on neuroinflammation. Furthermore, -syn expression led to an expansion in BAM numbers and a unique damage-associated activation state. Through a combinatorial approach of single-cell RNA sequencing and depletion experiments, we found that BAMs played an essential role in immune cell recruitment, infiltration, and antigen presentation. Furthermore, BAMs were identified in post-mortem PD brain in close proximity to T cells. These results point to a critical role for BAMs in mediating PD pathogenesis through their essential role in the orchestration of the -syn-mediated neuroinflammatory response.",

This subset distinctively expresses the chemokine Ccl19 necessary for niche functions. It markedly declines with age and in the acute setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplant conditioning. When isolated and adoptively transferred, these cells durably engrafted the atrophic thymus, recruited early T progenitors, increased T cell neogenesis, expanded TCR complexity and enhanced T cell response to vaccination.

We showed that this pseudogene was specifically transcribed in testis and can produce a Phf8-ps protein in vivo. As Phf8-ps protein has a well-conserved JmjC domain, we characterized its enzymatic activity and showed that Phf8-ps did not have the intrinsic capability to demethylate H3K9me2 in vitro compared to the parental Phf8 protein. Surprisingly, Phf8-ps did not localize in the nucleus like Phf8 but rather was mostly located at the cytoplasm. Finally, our proteomic analysis of Phf8-ps associated proteins revealed that Phf8-ps interacted with mitochondrial proteins but also with prefoldin subunits (PFDN proteins) that deliver unfolded proteins to the cytosolic chaperonin complex implicated the folding of cytosolic proteins.

    "abstract": "Chinese forest musk deer (FMD, Moschus berezovskii) glands have the ability to secrete musk, which plays an important role in attracting females during the breeding season. Sebaceous glands (SGs) are exocrine skin glands associated with hair follicles that continuously release a mixture of sebum, lipids and cellular debris, by holocrine secretion. Both the musk glands and the skin tissues of the FMD contain abundant sebaceous glands, and Sox9, Caveolin1, and Androgen receptor (AR) are all involved in the regulation of sebum secretion by the sebaceous glands. However, there are fewer studies on the correlation between skin and musk glands and the expression of Sox9, Caveolin1, and AR in the musk glands and skin tissue of FMD. To address this gap, we analyzed biochemical data from FMD skin tissues and musk glands using transcriptomic data, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), tissue dissection, and RT-qPCR. Anatomical results show that only adult male FMD had complete glandular part and sachets, while 4-month-old FMD do not have well-developed sachets. Transcriptomic data showed that 88.24% of genes were co-expressed in the skin and musk glands tissues of FMD. The WB, IHC, and RT-qPCR results showed that the genes involved in regulating sebum secretion, Sox9, Caveolin1, and AR were expressed in the skin tissues and musk glands. In summary, skin tissues and musk glands tissue have a strong correlation, and Sox9, Caveolin1, and AR may play important roles in skin tissues and musk glands tissue.",

    "abstract": "Auto-phosphorylation controls the transition between discrete functional and conformational states in protein kinases, yet the structural and molecular determinants underlaying this fundamental process remain unclear. Here we show that c-terminal Tyr 530 is a de facto c-Src auto-phosphorylation site with slow time-resolution kinetics and strong intermolecular component. On the contrary, activation-loop Tyr 419 undergoes fast kinetics and a cis-to-trans phosphorylation-switch that controls c-terminal Tyr 530 auto-phosphorylation, enzyme specificity and strikingly, c-Src non-catalytic function as a substrate. In line with this, we visualize by X-ray crystallography a snapshot of Tyr 530 intermolecular phosphorylation in which a c-terminal palindromic phospho-motif flanking Tyr 530 on the susbtrate molecule engages the P-loop of the active kinase for ready entry prior catalysis. Perturbation of the phospho-motif accounts for c-Src disfunction as indicated by viral and a colorectal cancer (CRC) associated c-terminal deleted variants. We show that c-terminal residues 531 to 536 are required for c-Src Tyr 530 and global auto-phosphorylation, and this detrimental effect is caused by the susbtrate molecule inhibiting allosterically the active kinase.

    "abstract": "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is being actively explored as a treatment for multiple conditions as part of bioelectronic medicine research. Reliable and safe VNS in mouse models is a critical need for understanding mechanisms of these. We report on the development and evaluation of a microfabricated cuff electrode (MouseFlex) constructed of polyimide (PI) and with iridium oxide (IrOx) electrodes that is thermoformed to 86 {micro}m {+/-} 12 {micro}m radius to interface the mouse cervical vagus nerve (r {approx} 50 {micro}m). Innovative bench-top methods were used to evaluated the stimulation stability and electrochemical properties of electrodes. Our aggressive stimulation stability (Stim-Stab) test utilized 1 billion pulses at a 1000 Hz with a current density of 6.28 A/cm2 (1.51 mC/cm2/phase) to evaluate electrode lifetimes, and all electrodes remained functional. We also investigated the effects of thermoforming on their impedance, charge storage capacity (CSC), and charge injection capacity (CIC). The modest changes in electrochemical properties indicate that the thermoforming process was well tolerated. Thermoformed electrode safety and efficacy were evaluated in-vivo by performing acute VNS in mice and monitoring their heart and respiration rate as biomarkers. Their electrochemical properties were also measured before, during and after VNS. Bradycardia and bradypnea were reliably induced at stimulation currents of 100 to 200 {micro}A, well below the in-vivo CIC of ~1250 {micro}A (~0.5 mC/cm2), supporting their safety and efficacy. The electrode impedance increased and CIC decreased during in-vivo use, but largely reversed these changes in in-vitro testing after enzymatic cleaning, supporting their tolerance for surgical use.",

    "abstract": "Genus Fusarium includes ubiquitous species complexes and are often resistant to multiple stressors. Early epidemiological evidence show that metal resistance genes (MRGs) influence the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in microbial communities. More recent evidence points out that this correlation is due to the physical linkage of these genes. Given the utmost importance of Fusarium pathogenicity to agriculture, and the ever-increasing rise in metal or metalloid displacement in the environment - this paper aims to pioneer the investigation of whether pathogenicity determinants also correlate well with MRGs. To provide probable patterns of horizontal gene transfer or incomplete lineage sorting, a species tree was initially defined. Fusarium is unanimously monophyletic from our phylogenetic analysis of 19 concatenated loci. However, saturation analysis show that most of sequences beyond the Terminal Fusarium Clade (TFC) are saturated and are likely to show erroneous phylogenetic relationships. Further analysis of tree topologies also show discordance among loci. Metal-resistance proteins (MRPs) and pathogenicity-related proteins (PRPs) were present in almost all the genomes tested. Remarkably, correlation between MRPs and PRPs among Fusarium is positive and statistically significant. Moreover, there the some of the MRPs and PRPs co-occur significantly more than chance alone. Overall, this suggests that there is a possibility that pathogenicity and metal tolerance proteins among Fusarium may co-occur.",

    "abstract": "The small-molecule drug ralimetinib was developed as an inhibitor of the kinase p38, and it has advanced to phase 2 clinical trials in oncology. Here, we apply a multi-modal approach to demonstrate that ralimetinibs anti-cancer activity occurs due to its ability to inhibit EGFR, rather than p38. We find that cancer cell lines driven by EGFR mutations exhibit the greatest sensitivity to ralimetinib treatment, and ralimetinib phenocopies established EGFR inhibitors in pharmacogenomic profiling experiments. We further demonstrate that ralimetinib inhibits EGFR kinase activity in vitro and in cellulo, albeit at >30-fold higher concentrations than it inhibits p38. Finally, while deletion of the gene encoding p38 has no effect on ralimetinib sensitivity, expression of the EGFR-T790M gatekeeper mutation confers resistance to ralimetinib treatment. These findings suggest that future clinical trials involving ralimetinib could incorporate EGFR mutation status as a biomarker to identify sensitive patients. Moreover, our results demonstrate that a compounds anti-cancer effects should not necessarily be attributed to the protein that it inhibits most strongly, and instead, comprehensive cellular and genetic profiling is required to understand a drugs mechanism-of-action.",

As the dynamics of agroecosystems are highly intricate, consisting of tangled networks of interactions between plants, microorganisms, and the surrounding environment, the recognition of the key molecular components of terroir fingerprinting remains a great challenge to protect both the origin and the safety of food commodities.

    "abstract": "Although some advancements concerning the arousal involved in mediating the delayed emergency from general anesthesia, which will lead to the serious complications, had been made, the role by arousal in modulating in delayed emergency still remains to be unclear. In our models, based on our previous working that activation of the 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) by optogenetics can significantly reduce the emergency time by activating arousal pathway, we further test whether the serotonergic neural circuit between the DRN and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is implicated in modulating the arousal from the sevoflurane anesthesia and the emergency time of sevoflurane anesthesia by the pharmacological, optogenetics and fiber photometry. Our findings showed that whether the serotonergic neural circuit between the DRN and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a key role in modulating the arousal from the sevoflurane anesthesia and the emergency time of sevoflurane anesthesia. Based on the serotonergic neural circuit, the 5-HT 1 A receptor is of great significance to mediate the arousal and the emergency time of the sevoflurane anesthesia.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/511924v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@34621eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@115ae09org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@54eb12org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11515ff_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure1C_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of non-fatal global disease burden, with females being two-fold more likely than males to be diagnosed with the disorder. Despite this distinct sex-linked disparity of diagnosis, it is unclear what underlies the sex bias of MDD prevalence. Recent findings suggest a role for the gut in mediating affective disorders through the gut-brain-axis (GBA). However, few studies have included sex as a biological variable. For this study, cross-sex transfer of cecal microbiota was performed between male and female C57Bl/6 mice to elucidate the effects of sex and the gut microbiome on a standard battery of tests measuring depressive-like behaviours. Specifically, regardless of sex, recipients of male cecal content had a greater sucrose preference than controls and recipients of female cecum. Conversely, in the splash test, recipients of female cecum displayed a decrease in grooming behaviour compared to both controls and recipients of male cecum, suggestive of an increase in depressive-like behaviour. These results support a role for female-specific gut microbes in contributing to female vulnerability to depression, while male-specific gut microbes may protect in part against an anhedonia-like phenotype",

    "abstract": "Despite ongoing improvements in regimens to prevent allograft rejection, most cardiac and other types of allografts eventually succumb to chronic vasculopathy, interstitial fibrosis, or endothelial changes, and eventually graft failure. Adaptive immune-mediated damage is considered the primary cause of long-term graft failure, though the events leading to chronic rejection are still poorly understood. Gut microbiota is a known driving force in immune dysfunction. We previously showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis profoundly influences the outcome of vascularized cardiac allografts and subsequently identified biomarker species or \"bacterial determinants\" associated with these differential graft outcomes (anti-inflammatory Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (Bifido) and pro-inflammatory Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (Desulfo)). In this study, we further detailed the multifaceted immunomodulatory properties of the pro-tolerogenic bacterial species over time, using our clinically relevant model of allogenic heart transplantation. This model simultaneously accounts for the immunomodulatory properties of antibiotics and tacrolimus immunosuppression, in addition to bacterial determinants. We observed that Bifido induced an early anti-inflammatory phenotype within 7 days, while Desulfo resulted in a pro-inflammatory phenotype, defined by alterations in leukocyte distribution and lymph node (LN) structure. These effects were further modulated by inhibition of myeloid cell migration by CCR2 inhibition, supporting the notion that bacterial determinants regulate innate immunity which subsequently influences adaptive immunity. Indeed, in vitro results showed that Bifido and Desulfo acted directly on primary innate immune cells. However, by 40 days after treatment, these two bacterial determinants were associated with mixed effects in their impact on LN architecture and immune cell composition. These dynamic effects suggest a critical role for early bacterial determinant-triggered immunological events such as innate immune cell engagement and LN architectural changes in the subsequent modulation of pro-tolerant versus pro-inflammatory immune responses in organ transplant recipients.",

    "abstract": "Antibody heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) variable region exons are assembled by V(D)J recombination. V(D)J junctional regions encode complementarity-determining-region 3 (CDR3), an antigen-contact region immensely diversified through non-templated nucleotide additions (\"N-regions\") by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). HIV-1 vaccine strategies seek to elicit human HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), such as the potent CD4-binding site VRC01-class bnAbs. Mice with primary B cells that express receptors (BCRs) representing bnAb precursors are used as vaccination models. VRC01-class bnAbs uniformly use human HC VH1-2 and commonly use human LCs V{kappa}3-20 or V{kappa}1-33 associated with an exceptionally short 5-amino-acid (5-aa) CDR3. Prior VRC01-class models had non-physiological precursor levels and/or limited precursor diversity. Here, we describe VRC01-class rearranging mice that generate more physiological primary VRC01-class BCR repertoires via rearrangement of VH1-2, as well as V{kappa}1-33 and/or V{kappa}3-20 in association with diverse CDR3s. Human-like TdT expression in mouse precursor B cells increased LC CDR3 length and diversity and also promoted generation of shorter LC CDR3s via N-region suppression of dominant microhomology-mediated V{kappa}-to-J{kappa} joins. Priming immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer, which strongly engages VRC01 precursors, induced robust VRC01-class germinal center (GC) B cell responses. V{kappa}3-20-based responses were enhanced by N-region addition, which generates V{kappa}3-20-to-J{kappa} junctional sequence combinations that encode VRC01-class 5-aa CDR3s with a critical E residue. VRC01-class-rearranging models should facilitate further evaluation of VRC01-class prime and boost immunogens. These new VRC01-class mouse models establish a prototype for generation of vaccine-testing mouse models for other HIV-1 bnAb lineages that employ different HC or LC Vs.\n\nSignificance StatementMouse models that express human precursors of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are useful for evaluating vaccination strategies for eliciting such bnAbs in humans. Prior models were handicapped by non-physiological frequency and/or diversity of B lymphocytes that express the bnAb precursors. We describe a new class of mouse models in which the mice express humanized bnAb precursors at a more physiologically relevant level through developmental rearrangement of both antibody heavy and light chain gene segments that encode the precursors. The model also incorporated a human enzyme that diversifies the rearranging gene segments and promotes generation of certain variable region sequences needed for the response. This new class of mouse models should facilitate preclinical evaluation of candidate human HIV-1 vaccination strategies.",

Disease-associated S. suis reference strains are well studied, but less is known about commensal lineages. It is not known what mechanisms enable some S. suis lineages to cause disease while others persist as commensal colonizers, or to what extent gene expression in disease-associated and commensal lineages diverge. In this study we compared the transcriptomes of 21 S. suis strains grown in active porcine serum and Todd-Hewitt yeast broth. These strains included both commensal and pathogenic strains, including several strains of sequence type (ST) 1, which is responsible for most cases of human disease and considered the most pathogenic S. suis lineage. We sampled the strains during their exponential growth phase and mapped RNA-sequencing reads to the corresponding strain genomes. We found that the transcriptomes of pathogenic and commensal strains with large genomic divergence were unexpectedly conserved when grown in active porcine serum, but that regulation and expression of key pathways varied. Notably, we observed strong variation of expression across media of genes involved in capsule production in pathogens, and of the agmatine deiminase system in commensals. ST1 strains displayed large differences in gene expression between the two media compared to strains from other clades. Their capacity to regulate gene expression across different environmental conditions may be key to their success as zoonotic pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila replicates intracellularly by secreting effectors via a type IV secretion system. One of these effectors is a eukaryotic methyltransferase (RomA) that methylates K14 of histone H3 (H3K14me3) to counteract host immune responses. However, it is not known how L. pneumophila infection catalyses H3K14 methylation as this residue is usually acetylated. Here we show that L. pneumophila secretes a eukaryotic-like histone deacetylase (LphD) that specifically targets H3K14ac and works in synergy with RomA. Both effectors target host chromatin and bind the HBO1 histone acetyltransferase complex that acetylates H3K14. Full activity of RomA is dependent on the presence of LphD as H3K14 methylation levels are significantly decreased in a {Delta}lphD mutant. The dependency of these two chromatin-modifying effectors on each other is further substantiated by mutational and virulence assays revealing that the presence of only one of these two effectors impairs intracellular replication, while a double knockout ({Delta}lphD{Delta}romA) can restore intracellular replication. Uniquely, we present evidence for \"para-effectors\", an effector pair, that actively and coordinately modify host histones to hijack the host response. The identification of epigenetic marks modulated by pathogens opens new vistas for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to counteract bacterial infection and strengthening host defences.",

    "abstract": "The X-chromosome is among the largest human chromosomes. It differs from autosomes by a number of important features including hemizygosity in males, an almost complete inactivation of one copy in females, and unique patterns of recombination. We used data from the Catalog of Published Genome Wide Association Studies to compare densities of the GWAS-detected SNPs on the X-chromosome and autosomes. The density of GWAS-detected SNPs on the X-chromosome is 6-fold lower compared to the density of the GWAS-detected SNPs on autosomes. Differences between the X-chromosome and autosomes cannot be explained by differences in the overall SNP density, lower X-chromosome coverage by genotyping platforms or low call rate of X-chromosomal SNPs. Similar differences in the density of GWAS-detected SNPs were found in female-only GWASs (e.g. ovarian cancer GWASs). We hypothesized that the lower density of GWAS-detected SNPs on the X-chromosome compared to autosomes is not a result of a methodological bias, e.g. differences in coverage or call rates, but has a real underlying biological reason - a lower density of functional SNPs on the X-chromosome versus autosomes. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that (i) the overall SNP density of X-chromosome is lower compared to the SNP density on autosomes and that (ii) the density of genic SNPs on the X-chromosome is lower compared to autosomes while densities of intergenic SNPs are similar.\n\nAuthor summaryOne of the most striking observations from the Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) is that the density of GWAS hits is much lower on X-chromosome compared to autosomes. This was initially explained by technical/analytical reasons such as lower coverage and lack of adequate methods to analyze X-chromosomal SNPs. Since then, a better coverage and better analytical methods to analyze X-chromosomal SNPs were developed. We recently revisited the issue and found that the density of GWAS hits on X-chromosome is at least 5-fold lower compared to autosomes. We demonstrated that the difference cannot be explained by technical or analytical reasons. We proposed a hypothesis of a real biological phenomenon underlying X versus autosomal differences in the density of GWAS-detected SNPs, namely that X-chromosome has a lower density of functional polymorphisms compared to autosomes because of a stronger selection against X-chromosomal mutations since X-chromosomal variants are more exposed to natural selection due to hemizygosity in males and X-chromosome inactivation in females. The hypothesis is supported by the analysis of the densities of intergenic, intronic and exonic SNPs on human chromosomes.",

Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a high resolution platform for prognostic signature detection. However, scRNA-seq is not practical in large cohorts due to its high cost and most single-cell experiments lack clinical phenotype information. Few studies have been reported to use external bulk transcriptome with survival time to guide the detection of key cell subtypes in scRNA-seq data. We proposed a data analysis framework to prioritize prognostic-associated subpopulations based on relative expression orderings (REOs). Cell type specific gene pairs (C-GPs) were identified to evaluate prognostic value for each cell type. We found REOs-based signatures could accurately classify most cell subtypes. C-GPs achieves higher precision compared with four current methods. Moreover, we developed single-cell gene pair signatures to predict recurrence risk for patients individually. Fibro_SGK1 cells and IgA+ IGLC2+ B cells were novel prognostic-associated subpopulations. A user-friendly toolkit, scRankXMBD (https://github.com/xmuyulab/scRank-XMBD), was developed to enable implementation of this framework. Our work facilitate the application of the rank-based method in scRNA-seq data for prognostic biomarker discovery and precision oncology.",

    "abstract": "Functional interpretation of spatial transcriptomics data usually requires non-trivial pre-processing steps and other supporting data in the analysis due to the high sparsity and incompleteness of spatial RNA profiling, especially in 3D constructions. As a solution, we present a new software tool FIST-nD, Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion in n-Dimensions for imputing 3D as well as 2D spatial transcriptomics data. FIST-nD is implemented based on a novel graph-regularized tensor decomposition method, which imputes spatial gene expression data using 4-way high-order tensor structure and relations in spatial and gene functional graphs. The implementation, accelerated by GPU or multicore parallel computing, can efficiently impute high-resolution 3D spatial transcriptomics data within a few minutes. The experiments on three 3D Spatial Transcriptomics datasets and one 3D high-resolution Stereo-seq dataset confirm the high accuracy of the imputation by FIST-nD and demonstrate that the imputed spatial transcriptomes provide a more complete gene expression landscape for downstream analyses such as spatial gene expression clustering and visualizations.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) target multiple epitopes on different domains of the spike protein, and other SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We developed a SARS-CoV-2 multi-antigen protein microarray with the nucleocapsid, spike and its domains (S1, S2), and variants with single (D614G, E484K, N501Y) or double substitutions (N501Y/Deletion69/70), allowing a more detailed high-throughput analysis of the antibody repertoire following infection. The assay was demonstrated to be reliable and comparable to ELISA. We analyzed antibodies from 18 COVID-19 patients and 12 recovered convalescent donors. S IgG level was higher than N IgG in most of the COVID-19 patients, receptor-binding domain of S1 showed high reactivity, but no antibodies were detected against heptad repeat domain 2 of S2. Furthermore, antibodies were detected against S variants with single and double substitutions in COVID-19 patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 multi-antigen protein microarray is a powerful tool for detailed characterization of antibody responses, with potential utility in understanding the disease progress and assessing current vaccines and therapies against evolving SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) is structurally dynamic and has been observed by cryo-EM to adopt a variety of prefusion conformations that can be categorized as locked, closed and open. The locked conformations feature tightly packed trimers with structural elements incompatible with RBD in \"up\" position. For SARS-CoV-2 S, it has been shown that the locked conformations are transient under neutral pH. Probably due to their transience, locked conformations remain largely uncharacterized for SARS-CoV-1 S. Intriguingly, locked conformations were the only conformations captured for S proteins of bat and pangolin origin SARS-related coronaviruses. In this study, we introduced x1, x2, and x3 disulfides into SARS-CoV-1 S. Some of these disulfides have been shown to preserve rare locked conformations when introduced to SARS-CoV-2 S. Introduction of these disulfides allowed us to image a variety of locked and other rare conformations for SARS-CoV-1 S by cryo-EM. We identified bound cofactors and structural features that are associated with SARS-CoV-1 S locked conformations. We compare newly determined structures to other available spike structures of Sarbecoviruses to identify conserved features and discuss their possible functions.",
