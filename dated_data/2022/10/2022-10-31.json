    "abstract": "Twin and family studies have historically aimed to partition phenotypic variance into components corresponding to additive genetic effects (A), common environment (C), and unique environment (E). Here we present the ACE Model and several extensions in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study(R)), employed using the new Fast Efficient Mixed Effects Analysis (FEMA) package. In the twin sub-sample (n = 924; 462 twin pairs), heritability estimates were similar to those reported by prior studies for height (twin heritability = 0.86) and cognition (twin heritability between 0.00 and 0.61), respectively. Incorporating SNP-derived genetic relatedness and using the full ABCD Study(R) sample (n = 9,742) led to narrower confidence intervals for all parameter estimates. By leveraging the sparse clustering method used by FEMA to handle genetic relatedness only for participants within families, we were able to take advantage of the diverse distribution of genetic relatedness within the ABCD Study(R) sample.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite the many insights gleaned from GWAS, polygenic predictions of complex traits have had limited success, particularly when these predictions are applied to individuals of non-European descent. A deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits may inform why some traits are easier to predict than others.\n\nMethodsExamining 163 complex traits from the UK Biobank, we compared and contrasted three aspects of genetic architecture (SNP heritability, LD variability, and genomic inequality) with three aspects of polygenic score performance (prediction accuracy in the source population, portability across populations, and trait divergence across populations). Here, genomic inequality refers to how unequally the genetic variance of each trait is distributed across the top trait-associated SNPs, as quantified via a novel application of Gini coefficients.\n\nResultsConsistent with reduced statistical power, polygenic predictions of binary traits performed worse than predictions of quantitative traits. Traits with low Gini coefficients (i.e., highly polygenic architectures) include hip circumference as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Traits with large population-level differences in polygenic scores include skin pigmentation and hair color. Focusing on 96 quantitative traits, we found that highly heritable traits were easier to predict and had predictions that were more portable to other ancestries. Traits with highly divergent polygenic score distributions across populations were less likely to have portable predictions. Intriguingly, LD variability was largely uninformative regarding the portability of polygenic predictions. This suggests that factors other than the differential tagging of causal SNPs drive the reduction in polygenic score accuracy across populations. Subsequent analyses identified suites of traits with similar genetic architecture and polygenic score performance profiles. Importantly, lifestyle and psychological traits tended to have low heritability, as well as poor predictability and portability.\n\nConclusionsNovel metrics capture different aspects of trait-specific genetic architectures and polygenic score performance. Our findings also caution against the application of polygenic scores to traits like general happiness, alcohol frequency, and average income, especially when polygenic scores are applied to individuals who have an ancestry that differs from the original source population.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal modeling has significant potential as a translational and clinical research tool for examining neuromuscular injuries and disorders. However its adoption has been limited due, in part, to the difficulty of measuring the subject-specific physiological measures that define model parameters. These measurements may require substantial time and expensive methods, such as MRI, to determine the parameters of a model and thus ensure its accuracy. We used a Monte Carlo simulation to examine the impact of parameter variability on the ill-defined, inverse approximation of muscle activity. We first amalgamated previously published measurements of the physiological characteristics of the upper/lower arm and the biceps/triceps muscles. We then used the observed distributions of these measurements to set physiologically plausible boundaries on uniform distributions and then generated perturbed parameter sets. We computed the root mean squared error (RMSE) between muscle activity patterns generated by the perturbed model parameters to those generated by the original parameters. Regression models were fit to the RMSE of the approximated muscle activity patterns to determine the sensitivity of the simulation results to variation in each parameter. We found that variation in parameters associated with muscle physiology had the most effect on RMSE, suggesting that these parameters may require subject-specific scaling, whereas parameters associated with skeletal bodies had less effect, and might be safely approximated by their population means.",

    "abstract": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Blood Pressure Variability (BPV) are widely employed tools for characterizing the complex behavior of cardiovascular dynamics. Usually, HRV and BPV analyses are carried out through short-term (ST) measurements, which exploit [~]5 minute-long recordings. Recent research efforts are focused on reducing the time series length, assessing whether and to what extent Ultra-Short Term (UST) analysis is capable of extracting information about cardiovascular variability from very short recordings. In this work, we compare ST and UST measures computed on electrocardiographic R-R intervals and systolic arterial pressure time series obtained at rest and during both postural and mental stress. Standard time-domain indices are computed, together with entropy-based measures able to assess regularity and complexity of cardiovascular dynamics, on time series lasting up to 60 samples, employing either a faster linear parametric estimator or a more reliable but time-consuming model-free method based on nearest neighbor estimates. Our results evidence that shorter time series up to 120 samples still exhibit an acceptable agreement with the ST reference, and can be exploited to discriminate between stress and rest as well. Moreover, although neglecting nonlinearities inherent to short-term cardiovascular dynamics, the faster linear estimator is still capable of detecting differences among the conditions, thus resulting suitable to be implemented on wearable devices.",

    "abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major clinical challenge in the management of glioblastoma (GBM) Temozolomide (TMZ) is the chemotherapeutic drug of choice for GBM; however, the therapeutic effect of TMZ is limited due to the development of resistance. Recapitulating GBM chemoresistance in a controlled environment is thus essential in understanding the mechanism of chemoresistance. Herein, we present a hybrid microphysiological model of chemoresistant GBM-on-a-chip (HGoC) by directly co-culturing TMZ-resistant GBM spheroids with healthy neurons to mimic the microenvironment of both the tumor and the surrounding healthy tissue. We characterized the model with proteomics, lipidomics, and secretome assays. The results showed that our artificial model recapitulated the molecular signatures of recurrent GBM in humans. Both showed alterations in vesicular transport and cholesterol pathways, mitotic quiescence, and a switch in metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation associated with a transition from mesenchymal to amoeboid. This is the first report to unravel the interplay of all these molecular changes as a mechanism of chemoresistance in glioblastoma. Moreover, we have shown that the acquisition of resistance increases invasiveness and the presence of neurons decreases this property.",

    "abstract": "Bioprinting technologies utilize hydrogel-based biomaterials to more accurately depict in vivo physical conditions within in vitro studies, yet, manufacturing the human brain from soft, poroelastic hydrogels remains a fundamental challenge. Conventional manufacturing routes to fabricate hydrogel brain models using techniques, i.e., 3D printing, seems challenging. This study aims to demonstrate an inverse replica molding fabrication technique that can overcome these challenges while maintaining the complex shape of an individual subjects brain in a miniaturized model--allowing for a more robust hydrogel model that can capture the interactions between diffusing molecules and brain boundaries. This is done by taking a subjects magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and reconstructing the outer pial surface into a mesh surface. The mesh was then converted to an STL and printed out using an extrusion printer. A silicon mold was made from this print into which agarose was gelled. Once fully gelated, the synthetic gel brain was then carefully removed. Two infusion trials were run in the gel brain, each using a different infusion site. Then a diffusion profile was established and compared to a simple gel infusion model. The result shows different diffusion profiles at each location and between the simple and complex models. This model can better represent the interference the complex shape of the brain has on particle movement compared to simple gel models.",

    "abstract": "Assays utilizing molecular fluorophores are common throughout life science research and diagnostic testing, although detection limits are generally limited by weak emission intensity, thus requiring many labeled target molecules to combine their output to achieve signal-to-noise greater than the background. Here, we describe how the synergistic coupling of plasmonic and photonic resonance modes can significantly boost the emission from fluorescent dye molecules without increasing the illumination intensity while utilizing a microscopy approach with a broad field of view. By optimally matching the resonant modes of a plasmonic fluor (PF) nanoparticle and a photonic crystal (PC) surface with the absorption and emission spectrum of the PFs fluorescent dye, we observe a 52-fold improvement in signal intensity, enabling individual PFs to be observed and digitally counted, using an approach in which one PF tag represents detection of one target molecule. The photonic amplification from the PF can be attributed to the strong near-field enhancement due to the cavity-induced activation of the PF, PC band structure-mediated improvement in collection efficiency of emitted photons, and increased rate of spontaneous emission. We demonstrate the applicability of the method by dose-response characterization of a sandwich immunoassay for human interleukin-6, a biomarker commonly used to assist diagnosis of cancer, inflammation, sepsis, and autoimmune disease. We achieve a limit of detection of 10 fg/ml, representing a capability three orders of magnitude lower than standard immunoassays.",

    "abstract": "Simulation is a key tool in population genetics for both methods development and empirical research, but producing simulations that recapitulate the main features of genomic data sets remains a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations are possible thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of available genetic data, and to the sophistication of inference and simulation software. However, implementing these simulations still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge. These challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for species that are not well-studied, since it is not always clear what information is required to produce simulations with a level of realism sufficient to confidently answer a given question. The community-developed framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population genetic models using up-to-date information. The initial version of stdpopsim focused on establishing this framework using six well-characterized model species (Adrion et al., 2020). Here, we report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim (version 0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the species catalog and substantial additions to simulation capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the simulated genomes include non-crossover recombination and provision of species-specific genomic annotations. Through community-driven efforts, we expanded the number of species in the catalog more than three-fold and broadened coverage across the tree of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we have identified common sticking points and developed best practices for setting up genome-scale simulations. We describe the input data required for generating a realistic simulation, suggest good practices for obtaining the relevant information from the literature, and discuss common pitfalls and major considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to further promote the use of realistic whole-genome population genetic simulations, especially in non-model organisms, making them available, transparent, and accessible to everyone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe aging process affects all systems of the human body, and the observed increase in inflammatory components affecting the immune system in old age can lead to the development of age-associated diseases and systemic inflammation.\n\nResultsWe propose a small clock model SImAge based on a limited number of immunological biomarkers. To regress the chronological age from cytokine data, we first use a baseline Elastic Net model, gradient-boosted decision trees models, and several deep neural network architectures. For the full dataset of 46 immunological parameters, DANet, SAINT, FT-Transformer and TabNet models showed the best results for the test dataset. Dimensionality reduction of these models with SHAP values revealed the 10 most age-associated immunological parameters, taken to construct the SImAge small immunological clock. The best result of the SImAge model shown by the FT-Transformer deep neural network model has mean absolute error of 6.94 years and Pearson{rho} = 0.939 on the independent test dataset. Explainable artificial intelligence methods allow for explaining the model solution for each individual participant.\n\nConclusionsWe developed an approach to construct a model of immunological age based on just 10 immunological parameters, coined SImAge, for which the FT-Transformer deep neural network model had proved to be the best choice. The model shows competitive results compared to the published studies on immunological profiles, and takes a smaller number of features as an input. Neural network architectures outperformed gradient-boosted decision trees, and can be recommended in the further analysis of immunological profiles.",

    "abstract": "Tissues are often isotropic and heterogeneous organizations, which developmental processes are coordinated by cells and extracellular matrix modeling. Cells have the capability of modeling matrix in distance, however, the biophysical mechanism is largely unknown. We investigated underlying mechanism of large collagen I (COL) fibrillary modeling by cell mechanics with designed arrays of cell clusters. By incorporating dynamic contractions, Molecular Dynamics simulations yielded highly matching isotropic outcomes with observed COL clustering in experiments from variable geometrical arrays without spatial limitation. Further designed single polygons from triangles to hexagons resulted in predicted structural assembly which showed maintained spatial balance. Cell cytoskeletal integrity (actin filaments, microtubules), actomyosin contractions, and endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels were essential for remote fiber inductions, while membrane mechanosensitive integrin and Piezo showed coordinative role in regulating the fiber assembly. The study provides new insights on cell mechanics-induced isotropic matrix modeling with dynamic large-spatial scales and the associated cellular mechanism. The assembled biomechanical scaffolds with pre-designs may lead to applications in micro-tissue engineering. This work implicates heterogeneous tissue structures maybe partially derived from isotropic cell mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Laws of physics shape morphological and behavioral adaptations to locomotion at different body sizes. Water striders serve as a model taxon to study how simple physical constraints of water-surface habitats affect their behavior and morphology, and hydrodynamics of rowing by midlegs on the surface is well understood. However, the physics of the subsequent passive sliding has been less explored. We created a model of sliding on the water surface to simulate the effect of body mass, striding type, and wetted leg lengths on an insects ability to float on the surface and on the sliding resistance. The model predicts that to support their weight on the surface during sliding, the heavy species should either develop long forelegs that support the frontal part of its body during symmetrical striding (when two midlegs thrust) or use asymmetrical striding (when one forward-extended midleg supports the body while the other midleg and contra-lateral hindleg thrust). These predictions are confirmed by the behavior and morphology of various Gerridae species. Hence, the results illustrate how simple physical processes specific to a certain habitat type have far-reaching consequences for the evolution of morphological and behavioral diversification associated with body size among biological organisms in these habitats.",

    "abstract": "I.The resolution revolution has increasingly enabled single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of previously inaccessible systems, including membrane proteins - a category that constitutes a disproportionate share of drug targets. We present a protocol for using density-guided molecular dynamics simulations to automatically refine atomistic models into membrane-protein cryo-EM maps. Using adaptive-force density-guided simulations as implemented in the GROMACS molecular dynamics package, we show how automated model refinement of a membrane protein is achieved without the need to manually tune the fitting force ad hoc. We also present selection criteria to choose the best fit model which balances stereochemistry and goodness-of-fit. The proposed protocol was used to refine models into a new cryo-EM density of the membrane protein maltoporin, either in a lipid bilayer or detergent micelle, and we found that results do not substantially differ from fitting in solution. Fitted structures satisfied classical model-quality metrics and improved the quality and the model-to-map correlation of the X-ray starting structure. Additionally, the density-guided fitting in combination with generalized orientation-dependent all-atom potential (GOAP) was used to correct the pixel-size estimation of the experimental cryo-EM density map. This work demonstrates the applicability of a straightforward automated approach to fitting membrane-protein cryo-EM densities. Such computational approaches promise to facilitate rapid refinement of proteins under different conditions or with various ligands present, including targets in the highly relevant superfamily of membrane proteins.\n\nII. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECryo-EM is an increasingly critical method of structure determination. As data collection and model generation become more efficient, iteratively fitting an experimental density can still require considerable time and expertise. Membrane proteins are particularly important targets in pharmacology and bioengineering, but can present distinctive challenges to data quality and modeling. Here, we tested a new tool to drive density fitting with molecular dynamics simulations, in context of a new structure of the membrane protein maltoporin. Fitting performed well in detergent, lipids, or solution, offering simpler options for fully automated simulation protocols. We were also able to apply fitting to adjust the microscopes pixel size. The approach described here should be applicable to rapid, accurate refinement of a variety of membrane-protein structures.",

    "abstract": "Small-angle scattering can be used to derive structural information about membrane proteins reconstituted in suitable carrier systems enabling solubilization of the membrane proteins in question. Since the studies are done in solution, there is no need for crystallization or deposition on sample grids, and it is in principle possible to obtain structural information about intrinsically disordered regions which cannot be resolved by crystallography or the quantitative link to which is hard to establish using e.g. electron microscopy methods. In this study, tetramers of the gated spinach aquaporin SoPIP2;1 were reconstituted into nanodiscs and small-angle x-ray scattering data were recorded. From these data, we refine structural models of the entire nanodisc-membrane protein complex including the flexible regions using newly developed models based on Fast Debye sums. We introduce software for these computations available via online repositories and discuss the implications and limitations of these methods.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen it comes to investigating the structure and function of the proteins, a particular class of proteins are known to be cumbersome and problematic: membrane proteins that reside in the cell membrane and regulate and facilitate a number of critical biological processes. Such proteins can often not be studied by conventional means as they unravel and denature structurally or even precipitate in solution. To add insult to injury, such membrane proteins also often contain parts that are intrinsically disordered rendering them irresolvable by e.g. traditional crystallographic techniques and hard to describe structurally. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental approach (as well as the necessary software) to analyze and determine the structure of such proteins in close-to-native conditions in so-called nanodiscs, a biological carrier systems, using small-angle scattering and molecular simulations.",

    "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of cancer arising in the distal lung. LUAD encompasses several pathologic subtypes, each with differing clinical outcomes and biological behaviors. However, the molecular and cellular underpinnings of the different subtypes are largely unknown. Understanding which cell populations in the distal lung contribute to LUAD could provide insights into the marked heterogeneity in pathologic features, clinical presentation and responses to therapy of LUAD. Differential expression analysis of lung adenocarcinoma transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed distinct alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cell signatures within human LUAD with significantly different survival outcomes between tumors expressing AT2 and AT1 gene signatures, suggesting AT1 cells might contribute to a subset of LUAD cases. To address this, we tested the ability of AT1 cells to give rise to LUAD following induction of KrasG12D, a known oncogenic driver of human LUAD. Activation of KrasG12D in Gram-domain containing 2 (Gramd2)+ AT1 cells gave rise to multiple LUAD lesions, primarily of papillary histology. In contrast, activation of KrasG12D in surfactant protein C (Sftpc+) AT2 cells resulted in LUAD lesions of lepidic histology. Immunohistochemistry established that Gramd2:KrasG12D lesions were of primary lung origin and not metastatic events. Spatial transcriptomic profiling revealed distinct pathway alterations within Gramd2- and Sftpc-derived LUAD. Immunofluorescence confirmed differences observed in the spatial transcriptomic analysis in expression patterns and distribution of cell-specific markers depending on cell of origin, while universal upregulation of the Krt8 intermediate cell state marker was observed. Our results are consistent with Gramd2+ AT1 cells serving as a putative cell of origin for LUAD and suggest that LUAD may be a collection of adenocarcinomas that share a common location within the distal lung but arise from different cells of origin.",

To exemplify the concept of ODD, we developed an artificial intelligence framework that integrates de novo molecular design, quantitative structure activity relationships, and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. Specifically, our computational architecture has integrated a generative algorithm for small molecule design with a hybrid physiologically-based pharmacokinetic machine learning (PBPK-ML) model, which was applied to generate and optimize drug candidates for enhanced brain exposure. Publicly sourced data on the plasma and brain pharmacokinetics of 77 small molecule drugs in rats was used for model development. We have observed an approximate 30-fold and 120-fold increase on average in predicted brain exposure for AI generated molecules compared to known central nervous system drugs and randomly selected small organic molecules. We believe that with additional data and mechanistic modeling this in silico pipeline could facilitate the discovery of a new wave of optimally designed medicines for the treatment of CNS diseases.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/514379v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1665857org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@31dc60org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b2aeeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13f8cbd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Artificial Intelligence Framework for the Optimization of Brain Pharmacokinetics.\n\nA genetic algorithm consisting of cross-breeding, mutating, scoring, and refining was used for de novo generation of a population of new molecular structures.

The biological activity of the obtained compounds was studied in a number of tests, including their effects on 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity of human CYP17A1 and the ability of selected compounds to affect the downstream androgen receptor signaling. Three derivatives diminished the transcriptional activity of androgen receptor and displayed reasonable antiproliferative activity.

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is altered across various psychiatric disorders. Brain network modeling (BNM) has the potential to reveal the neurobiological underpinnings of such abnormalities by dynamically modeling the structure-function relationship and examining biologically relevant parameters after fitting the models with real data. Although innovative BNM approaches have been developed, two main issues need to be further addressed. First, previous BNM approaches are primarily limited to simulating noise-driven dynamics near a chosen attractor (or a stable brain state). An alternative approach is to examine multi(or cross)-attractor dynamics, which can be used to better capture non-stationarity and switching between states in the resting brain. Second, previous BNM work is limited to characterizing one disorder at a time. Given the large degree of co-morbidity across psychiatric disorders, comparing BNMs across disorders might provide a novel avenue to generate insights regarding the dynamical features that are common across (vs. specific to) disorders. Here, we address these issues by (1) examining the layout of the attractor repertoire over the entire multi-attractor landscape using a recently developed cross-attractor BNM approach; and (2) characterizing and comparing multiple disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar, and ADHD) with healthy controls using an openly available and moderately large multimodal dataset from the UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics. Both global and local differences were observed across disorders. Specifically, the global coupling between regions was significantly decreased in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy controls. At the same time, the ratio between local excitation and inhibition was significantly higher in the schizophrenia group than the ADHD group. In line with these results, the schizophrenia group had the lowest switching costs (energy gaps) across groups for several networks including the default mode network. Paired comparison also showed that schizophrenia patients had significantly lower energy gaps than healthy controls for the somatomotor and visual networks. Overall, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting transdiagnostic multi-attractor BNM approaches to better understand psychiatric disorders pathophysiology.",

However, further refinement of this novel approach is needed to position it for clinical application. While activation signal strength differentially regulates IL-17 production by human CD4+ T cells, the degree to which TCR and co-stimulation signal strength impacts antitumor Th17 cell immunity remains poorly understood. We discovered that decreasing TCR/co-stimulation signal strength by incremental reduction of CD3/co-stimulation beads in a Th17 culture progressively diminished their effector memory phenotype but enhanced their polyfunctionality. Additional investigation revealed that Th17 cells stimulated with CD3/ICOS beads produced more IL-17A, IFN{gamma}, IL-2 and IL-22 than those stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads, regardless of signal strength. Th17 cells propagated with 30-fold fewer CD3/ICOS beads (weak signal strength, 1 bead per 10 T cells) were less reliant on glucose for growth compared to those stimulated with the standard, strong signal strength (3 beads per T cell). Further metabolomic analysis revealed Th17 cells weakly simulated with CD3/ICOS beads favored the central carbon pathway through increased gluconeogenesis for bioenergetics, marked by abundant intracellular phosphoenoylpyruvate (PEP). Importantly, Th17 cells weakly stimulated with CD3/ICOS beads and redirected with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes mesothelin were more effective at clearing large human mesothelioma tumors when infused into mice than those manufactured using the standard FDA-approved protocols. Taken together, these data indicate Th17 ACT therapy can be improved by using fewer activation beads during T cell manufacturing, a finding that is both cost effective and directly translatable to patients.",

The cardiac outflow tract lengthens by the accretion of progenitors derived from the second heart field (SHF). SHF cells in the splanchnic mesoderm are exquisitely regionalized and organized into an epithelial-like layer forming the dorsal pericardial wall (DPW). Tissue tension within the DPW, cell polarity and proliferation are requisite processes regulating the addition of SHF-derived cells to the heart and elongation of the cardiac outflow tract. However, genes regulating these processes are not completely understood. Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, we show that fibronectin (Fn1) synthesized by the SHF is a central regulator of the epithelial architecture in the DPW. Fn1 expression is enriched in the anterior DPW and mediates outflow tract elongation by regulating cell polarity, shape, cohesion, and mechanotransduction. Our studies establish that Fn1 synthesized specifically by the mesoderm coordinates multiple cellular behaviors in the anterior DPW requisite for the elongation of the cardiac outflow tract and embryonic viability.",

    "abstract": "Insecticide resistance evolution is becoming increasingly problematic globally. With chemical insecticides, attempts to combat resistance involves developing compounds with novel modes of action, or increasing rates to overcome partial resistance. While pests can develop resistance to pathogens used as biopesticides, these \"pesticides\" can be subjected to evolutionary selection pressure as well and may be able to adapt countermeasures to overcome pest resistance. Here, we consider two scenarios: 1) a single trait governs an arms race between pest and parasite, and 2) an epidemiological scenario where each, pathogen transmission and virulence, are governed by host and pathogen traits. Considering the single-trait parasite attack scenario, the evolving parasite is able to overcome resistance in the pest population and effectively suppress host population abundance. In this case, overcoming biopesticide resistance may be possible from parasite evolution to resistant hosts. In contrast, when transmission and abundance are allowed to vary independently in an epidemiological model, different pathogen traits promote different types of resistance development in the host - more contagious pathogens promote pathogen-tolerant (low mortality susceptibility) hosts, while less contagious pathogens promote pathogen-resistant (low transmission susceptibility) hosts. Pathogen-tolerant hosts are particularly detrimental to control programs, because they can quickly outcompete wild types by promoting infection in wild type populations. Furthermore, because evolution of pathogen-tolerance in pests can benefit pathogens through increasing infection prevalence, we do not expect pathogen evolution to improve control. Thus, the keys to biopesticide management depend on the virulence-transmission trade-off and whether hosts evolve to better prevent or survive infection.",

    "abstract": "Many animals convergently evolved photosynthetic symbioses, including two clades within the Bivalvia. Giant clams (Tridacninae) gape open to let light irradiate their symbionts, but heart cockles (Fraginae) can stay closed because sunlight passes through transparent windows in their shells. Here, we show that heart cockles (Corculum cardissa and spp., Cardiidae) use intricate biophotonic adaptations to transmit more than 30% of visible sunlight (400-700nm) while transmitting only 12% of potentially harmful UV radiation (300-400nm). Beneath each window, microlenses condense light to penetrate more deeply into the symbiont-rich tissue. In the shell windows, aragonite forms narrow fibrous prisms that are optically co-oriented perpendicularly to the shell surface. These bundled \"fiber optic cables project images through the shell with a resolution of >100 lines / mm. Further, parameter sweeps in optical simulations show that the observed size (~1m wide), morphology (long narrow fibers rather than typical aragonite plates), and orientation (along the c-axis) of the aragonite fibers transmit more light than many other possible morphologies. Heart cockle shell windows are thus: (i) the first instance of fiber optic cable bundles in an organism to our knowledge; (ii) a second evolution of condensing lenses for photosynthesis, as in plant epidermal cells; and (iii) a photonic system that efficiently transmits visible light while protecting photosymbionts from UV radiation. The animals soft tissues and the symbionts are therefore protected from predation and light stress.\n\nSignificance StatementPhotosymbiotic animals face a fundamental problem: they must irradiate their photosymbiotic symbionts without exposing their symbionts, or themselves, to predation and intense UV radiation. Reef-dwelling bivalves called heart cockles evolved an intricate biophotonic solution. Sunlight passes through clear windows in their shell, which are composed of aragonite fiber optic cable bundles and condensing lenses. This arrangement screens out UV radiation and allows the heart cockle to keep its shell closed. These intricate photonic adaptations are a novel solution to the evolutionary challenges of photosymbiosis: harnessing solar power while protecting against light stress and predation.",

In this study we have analyzed 726,718 autosomal SNPs in 435 individuals from the Catalan Pyrenees covering around 200 km of a vast and abrupt region in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, for which we have information about the geographic origin of all grand-parents and parents. At a macro-geographic scale, our analyses recapitulate the genetic gradient observed in Spain. However, we also identified the presence of micro-population substructure among the sampled individuals. Such micro-population substructure does not correlate with geographic barriers such as the expected by the orography of the considered region, but by the bishoprics present in the covered geographic area. These results support that, on top of main human migrations, long ongoing socio-cultural factors have also shaped the genetic diversity observed at rural populations.",

We report here on two clickable molecular tools, the biomimetic G-quadruplex (G4) ligands MultiTASQ and azMultiTASQ, which benefit from the versatility of two types of bioorthogonal chemistry, CuAAC and SPAAC (the discovery of which was very recently awarded the Nobel Prize of chemistry).

    "abstract": "Forensic Genetic Genealogy (FGG) requires high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles to infer distant relationships. The ForenSeq Kintelligence kit is a recently developed method targeting approximately 10,000 SNPs that were selected to be compatible with genetic genealogy databases, while avoiding medically relevant SNPs. The targeted PCR method is ideal for low input and degraded samples, which are particularly challenging for microarray analysis. We made modifications to library preparation and sample pooling to further enhance the performance of low input samples. To align this FGG method with forensic laboratory standards, we performed an internal validation study in accordance with the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods Validation Guidelines for DNA Analysis Methods. The sensitivity and precision and accuracy studies produced accurate and reliable profiles down to 0.05 ng of DNA. The mixture and contamination studies demonstrated that the method could detect the presence of a minor contributor down to 0.02 ng, while system wide contamination was negligible. Nonprobative bone, fired shell casing, and adhesive tape samples performed well with inputs ranging from 0.05 to 1.0 ng of DNA. A bone with a high degradation index and tested at 0.1 ng DNA input resulted in a call rate of 92.9% and a heterozygosity rate of 0.387. We demonstrated the importance of both call rate and heterozygosity rate to assess profile performance. Validating FGG methods is critical to ensuring the reliability and utility of SNP profiles that will be uploaded to genetic genealogy databases for the purpose of generating investigative leads.",

    "abstract": "Adult rodents exhibit an exceptional ability to retrieve context fear memories across lengthy retention intervals. In contrast, these same memories established in juvenile rodents are susceptible to significant forgetting. While much of this original work has focused on male rodents, emerging research indicates that the mechanisms of context fear conditioning in females may be sexually dimorphic. If so, these female memories may exhibit a unique mnemonic profile from male rats that may be probed using single-trial conditioning, extended retention intervals, and savings procedures. The current study aimed to examine the longevity of contextual fear memories established in 24-day-old juvenile and 90-day-old Long-Evans male and female rats. Testing at the 1-day retention interval, adults exhibited greater conditioning than juvenile males, while in females, conditioning did not differ between juvenile and adult rats. In adults, males displayed greater conditioning than females, while in juveniles, males and females reached similar conditioning levels. At the 60-day retention interval, adult sex differences were maintained; however, juvenile rats failed to retrieve this remote contextual fear memory. Next, we examined whether a savings trial and test procedure could recover these remotely established juvenile memories in both males and females. Following a 60-day retention test, the now adult rats were presented with an additional context-shock pairing to assess the level of saving in both male and female rats. While this procedure produced greater conditioning in males than females, the relative amounts of the savings of this early life memory were similar in males and females. Lastly, the recovery of this memory exhibited significant generalization relative to previously unshocked juveniles and was similar in males and females. The results of these experiments indicate that adult sex differences in contextual fear memory are maintained across an extended retention interval, while in juveniles, there were no significant sex differences. In addition, male and female rats failed to retrieve an initial juvenile memory at an extended retention interval. However, these memories could be recovered with a single reminder of the original juvenile experience.",

Sonogenetics for noninvasive activation of neurons engineered to express thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) by transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) was recently developed to address this need. However, using TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics to evoke behavior by targeting the cortex is challenged by its proximity to the skull due to high skull absorption of ultrasound and increased risks of thermal-induced tissue damage.\n\nObjectiveThis study evaluated the feasibility and safety of TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics in targeting the motor cortex to modulate the locomotor behavior of freely moving mice.\n\nMethodsAdeno-associated virus was delivered to the mouse motor cortex via intracranial injection to express TRPV1 in excitatory neurons. A wearable FUS device was installed on the mouse head after a month to control neuronal activity by activating virally expressed TRPV1 through FUS sonication at different acoustic pressures. Immunohistochemistry staining of ex vivo brain slices was performed to verify neuron activation and evaluate safety.\n\nResultsTRPV1-mediated sonogenetic stimulation at 0.7 MPa successfully evoked rotational behavior in the direction contralateral to the stimulation site, activated cortical neurons as indicated by the upregulation of c-Fos, and did not induce significant changes in inflammatory or apoptotic markers (GFAP, lba1, and Caspase-3). Sonogenetic stimulation of TRPV1 mice at a higher acoustic pressure, 1.1 MPa, induced significant changes in motor behavior and upregulation of c-Fos compared with FUS sonication of naive mice at 1.1 MPa. However, signs of damage at the meninges were observed at 1.1 MPa.\n\nConclusionsTRPV1-mediated sonogenetics can achieve effective and safe neuromodulation at the cortex with carefully selected FUS parameters. These findings expand the application of this technique to include superficial brain targets.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetics arises as a valuable tool to precisely control genetic circuits in microbial cell factories. Light control holds the promise of optimizing bioproduction methods and maximize yields, but its implementation at different steps of the strain development process and at different culture scales remains challenging. In this study, we aim to control beta-carotene bioproduction using optogenetics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and investigate how its performance translates across culture scales. We built four lab-scale illumination devices, each handling different culture volumes, and each having specific illumination characteristics and cultivating conditions. We evaluated optogenetic activation and beta-carotene production across devices and optimized them both independently. Then, we combined optogenetic induction and beta-carotene production to make a light-inducible beta-carotene producer strain. This was achieved by placing the transcription of the bifunctional lycopene cyclase / phytoene synthase CrtYB under the control of the pC120 optogenetic promoter regulated by the EL222-VP16 light-activated transcription factor, while other carotenogenic enzymes (CrtI, CrtE, tHMG) were expressed constitutively. We show that illumination, culture volume and shaking impact differently optogenetic activation and beta-carotene production across devices. This enabled us to determine the best culture conditions to maximize light-induced beta-carotene production in each of the devices, reaching a content of up to 880 g/gCDW. Our study exemplifies the stakes of scaling up optogenetics in devices of different lab scales and sheds light on the interplays and potential conflicts between optogenetic control and metabolic pathway efficiency. As a general principle, we propose that it is important to first optimize both components of the system independently, before combining them into optogenetic producing strains to avoid extensive troubleshooting. We anticipate that our results can help designing both strains and devices that could eventually lead to larger scale systems in an effort to bring optogenetics to the industrial scale.",

The extent this connectivity is paralleled by each structures volume impact on another is unquantified in Alzheimers disease (AD). Mixed model quantification of annual volume change in AD is scarce and absent inclusive of the cerebellum, hippocampus, putamen and lateral ventricles and thalamus. Among these structures, autopsy evidence of early-stage AD seems largely but not entirely restricted to the hippocampus and thalamus.\n\nObjectiveVariation in annual volume related to time and baseline age was assessed for the hippocampus, putamen, cerebellum, lateral ventricles and thalamus. Which subcortical structures volume had the largest explanatory effect of volume variation in other subcortical structures was also determined.\n\nMethodThe intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess test-retest reliability of structure automated segmentation. Linear regression (N = 45) determined which structures volume most impacted volume of other structures. Finally, mixed models (N = 36; 108 data points) quantified annual structure volume change from baseline to 24-months.\n\nResultsHigh test-retest reliability was indicated by a mean ICC score of .989 (SD = .012). Thalamic volume consistently had the greatest explanatory effect of hippocampal, putamen, cerebellar and lateral ventricular volume. The group variable proxy for AD significantly contributed to the best-fitting hippocampal linear regression model, hippocampal and thalamic longitudinal mixed models, and approached significance in the longitudinal lateral ventricular mixed model. Mixed models determined time (1 year) had a negative effect on hippocampal, cerebellar and thalamic volume, no effect on putamen volume, and a positive effect on lateral ventricular volume. Baseline age had a negative effect on hippocampal and thalamic volume, no effect on cerebellar or putamen volume and a positive effect on lateral ventricular volume.\n\nInterpretationLinear regression determined thalamic volume as a virtual centralized index of hippocampal, cerebellar, putamen, and lateral ventricular volume. Relative to linear regression, longitudinal mixed models had greater sensitivity to detect contribution of early AD, or potential AD pathology (MCI), via the group variable not just to volume reduction in the hippocampus but also in the thalamus.",

    "abstract": "Variation in defense traits likely depends on access to different resources and risk from herbivory. Plant defense theories have predicted both positive and negative associations between defense traits and access to resources, but relatively few studies have explored intraspecific variation in defense traits along multiple resource and mammalian herbivory risk gradients. We assessed relationships between herbivory intensity, multiple resources, and plant defense traits using a widely distributed tropical savanna herb, Solanum incanum. As independent measures of risk from large mammal herbivores are rare, we used a satellite-based vegetation index to predict herbivory intensity at the landscape scale. We found that the satellite-based estimate of herbivory intensity was positively associated with browser abundance and total soil P, but negatively associated with rainfall. Intraspecific defense traits too varied substantially across sites (n=43) but only variation in spine density was associated with herbivory intensity and plant resources, such that spine density was positively associated with both rainfall and soil P, but bimodally associated with herbivory intensity. Taken together, it suggests that defenses maybe favored either where resources for defense are abundant under low but still present risk (i.e, at high rainfall sites) or where resource-expensive plant tissue is at high risk (i.e, at high soil P sites). This hints at the possibility of a shift from a resource-associated (bottom-up) to an herbivory-associated (top-down) control of allocation to defenses along an environmental gradient. Additionally, the independent effect of soil P on a carbon-based defense, spine density, suggests potential for resources that are not components of defenses to also influence allocation to defense traits. Thus, our study provides evidence for the influence of multiple drivers, resources, and herbivory intensity, on anti-herbivore defenses and their shifting relative importance on allocation to defenses along an environmental gradient.",

    "abstract": "Ample evidence suggests that acute stress can worsen symptom severity in Tourette syndrome (TS); however, the neurobiological underpinnings of this phenomenon remain poorly understood. We previously showed that acute stress exacerbates tic-like and other TS-associated responses via the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP) in an animal model of repetitive behavioral pathology. To verify the relevance of this mechanism to tic pathophysiology, here we tested the effects of AP in a mouse model recapitulating the partial depletion of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the striatum seen in postmortem studies of TS. Mice underwent targeted depletion of striatal CINs during adolescence and were tested in young adulthood. Compared with controls, CIN-depleted male mice exhibited several TS-relevant abnormalities, including deficient prepulse inhibition (PPI) and increased grooming stereotypies after a 30-min session of spatial confinement, a mild acute stressor that increases AP synthesis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These effects were not seen in females. Systemic and intra-PFC AP administration dose-dependently worsened grooming stereotypies and PPI deficits in CIN-depleted males. Conversely, both AP synthesis inhibition and pharmacological antagonism reduced the effects of stress. These results further suggest that AP in the PFC mediates the adverse effects of stress on the severity of tics and other TS manifestations. Future studies will be necessary to confirm these mechanisms in patients and define the circuitry responsible for the effects of AP on tics.",

    "abstract": "Wildlife may be attracted or repelled by anthropogenic stimuli - by understanding these responses we gain powerful tools to modify their behavior. Anthropogenic lighting is ubiquitous but little is known about how it influences carnivores. We focused on pumas (Puma concolor) living around Los Angeles, California for which vehicular collision is an important source of mortality. We used GPS collars to track their movement around roads and combined this with ground-level and remotely sensed data of human generated nighttime light to see how that influenced activity around roads. There are multiple landscape level scales, and metrics of light relevant at each scale, that influence the perceptual landscape of wildlife and thus these different scales must be considered. We found that, at a broad spatial scale, pumas crossed roads more frequently in areas with low levels of anthropogenic light (controlling for distance to urbanization). However, while pumas crossed roads in darker parts of the landscape at a broad-landscape scale, we did not find a statistically significant relationship between puma eye-level light intensity and predicted road crossing locations.\n\nRegarding pumas and nighttime light, it appears that having dark swaths of land, at a broad spatial scale, is important. This is important for puma conservation and road design as little is currently known about wildlife movement response to nighttime light and the ideal placement for mitigation structures. Ultimately, anthropogenic light at night is a landscape aspect that needs to be better understood and integrated into conservation as the human footprint increases.",

    "abstract": "Solving the chemical master equation (CME) that characterizes the probability evolution of stochastically reacting processes is greatly important for analyzing intracellular reaction systems. Conventional methods for solving CMEs include the simulation-based Monte-Carlo methods, the direct approach (e.g., the finite state projection), and so on; however, they usually do not scale very well with the system dimension either in terms of accuracy or efficiency. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new computational method based on modularization and filtering. Our method first divides the whole system into a leader system and several conditionally independent follower subsystems. Then, we solve the CME by applying the Monte Carlo method to the leader system and the direct approach to the filtered CMEs that characterize the conditional probabilities of the follower subsystems. The system decomposition involved in our method is optimized so that all the subproblems above are low dimensional, and, therefore, our approach scales more favorably with the system dimension. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach in high-dimensional estimation and inference problems using several biologically relevant examples.\n\nSignificance StatementDue to the inherent randomness in microscale systems, an intracellular reaction system is often stochastic and modeled by a chemical master equation, which characterizes the probability evolution of this system. Solving this equation for high-dimensional problems is challenging: conventional methods, including the Monte-Carlo methods and the direct approach, are usually inaccurate or inefficient in these cases. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new method for solving CMEs based on modularization and filtering. Our method works by an optimized decomposition of the system, which transforms the high-dimensional problem into several low-dimensional ones; consequently, our approach scales more favorably with the system dimension. Finally, we use several biologically relevant examples to illustrate our approach in high-dimensional estimation and inference problems.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is inherently dynamic, due to complex regulation and stochastic biochemical events. However, the effects of these dynamics on cell phenotypes can be difficult to determine. Researchers have historically been limited to passive observations of natural dynamics, which can preclude studies of elusive and noisy cellular events where large amounts of data are required to reveal statistically significant effects. Here, using recent advances in the fields of machine learning and control theory, we train a deep neural network to accurately predict the response of an optogenetic system in Escherichia coli cells. We then use the network in a deep model predictive control framework to impose arbitrary and cell-specific gene expression dynamics on thousands of single cells in real time, applying the framework to generate complex time-varying patterns. We also showcase the frameworks ability to link expression patterns to dynamic functional outcomes by controlling expression of the tetA antibiotic resistance gene. This study highlights how deep learning-enabled feedback control can be used to tailor distributions of gene expression dynamics with high accuracy and throughput.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota contributes to macrophage-mediated inflammation in adipose tissue with consumption of an obesogenic diet, thus driving the development of metabolic syndrome. There is a need to identify and develop interventions that abrogate this condition. The hops-derived prenylated flavonoid xanthohumol (XN) and its semi-synthetic derivative tetrahydroxanthohumol (TXN) attenuate high-fat diet-induced obesity, hepatosteatosis and metabolic syndrome in C57Bl/6J mice. This coincides with a decrease in pro-inflammatory gene expression in the gut and adipose tissue, together with alterations in the gut microbiota and bile acid composition. In this study, we integrated and interrogated multi-omics data from different organs with fecal 16S sequences and systemic metabolic phenotypic data using a transkingdom network analysis. By incorporating cell type information from single cell RNA-seq data, we discovered TXN attenuates macrophage inflammatory processes in adipose tissue. TXN treatment also reversed levels of inflammation-inducing microbes, such as Oscillibacter valericigenes, that lead to adverse metabolic phenotypes. Furthermore, in vitro validation in macrophage cell lines and in vivo mouse supplementation showed addition of O. valericigenes supernatant induced the expression of metabolic macrophage signature genes that are downregulated by TXN in vivo. Our findings establish an important mechanism by which TXN mitigates adverse phenotypic outcomes from diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome. It primarily reduces the abundance of pro-inflammatory gut microbes that can otherwise promote macrophage-associated inflammation in adipose tissue.",

We applied PrEDiCT to single-cell expression data of six human tissues, to infer the cell types affected in 1,113 hereditary diseases. Overall, we identified 110 cell types affected by 714 diseases. We corroborated our findings by literature text-mining and recapitulation in mouse corresponding tissues. Based on these findings, we explored features of disease-affected cell types and cell classes, highlighted cell types affected by mitochondrial diseases and heritable cancers, and identified diseases that perturb intercellular communication.

    "abstract": "Time scales for biological processes span many orders of magnitude, forcing modelers to tackle coupled processes that have large time scale gaps. This results in rare events, which take longer to occur than the fastest processes in the model. Efficient generation of rare events has been a focus of modelers for a long time and multiple software packages implement various rare event sampling algorithms. However, these packages frequently require expertise to get started with, making it harder for researchers to start using them. WEBNG (short for Weighted Ensemble-BioNetGen) is an open source software framwework that bridges the open source software packages WESTPA, which implements the weighted ensemble method for sampling rare events, and BioNetGen, which facilitates the specification and simulation of biochemical reaction network models following a rule-based approach. WEBNG simplifies rare event sampling in simulations of rule-based models by taking a model specified in the BioNetGen language (BNGL) and generating a WESTPA simulation folder ready to simulate with default parameters selected to match model observables. WEBNG is written in Python with dependencies only on proven, open-source packages that are in active development, which makes WEBNG easy to install and maintain. Here, we describe the architecture and features of WEBNG and demonstrate its capabilities through application to a two-gene model of cell fate transitions.",

    "abstract": "Identified across multiple psychiatric disorders, the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) Ala559Val substitution triggers non-vesicular, anomalous DA efflux (ADE), perturbing DA neurotransmission and behavior. We have shown that DAT Val559 mice display a waiting impulsivity and changes in cognitive performance associated with enhanced reward motivation. Here, utilizing a within-subject, lever-pressing paradigm designed to bias the formation of goal-directed or habitual behavior, we demonstrate that DAT Val559 mice modulate their nose-poke behavior appropriately to match context, but demonstrate a perseverative checking behavior. Although DAT Val559 mice display no issues with the cognitive flexibility required to acquire and re-learn a visual pairwise discrimination task, devaluation of reward evoked habitual reward seeking in DAT Val559 mutants in operant tasks regardless of reinforcement schedule. The direct DA agonist apomorphine also elicits locomotor stereotypies in DAT Val559, but not WT mice. Our observation that dendritic spine density is increased in the dorsal medial striatum (DMS) of DAT Val559 mice speaks to an imbalance in striatal circuitry that might underlie the propensity of DAT Val559 mutants to exhibit compulsive behaviors when reward is devalued. Thus, DAT Val559 mice represent a model for dissection of how altered DA signaling perturbs circuits that normally balance habitual and goal-directed behaviors.",

    "abstract": "AimsRecurrent network activity in corticothalamic circuits generates physiological and pathological EEG waves. Many computer models have simulated spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), the EEG hallmark of absence seizures (ASs). However, these models either provided detailed simulated activity only in a selected territory (i.e. cortical or thalamic) or did not test whether their corticothalamic networks could reproduce the physiological activities that are generated by these circuits.\n\nMethodsUsing a biophysical large-scale corticothalamic model that reproduces the full extent of EEG sleep waves, including sleep spindles, delta and slow (<0.1 Hz) waves, here we investigated how single abnormalities in voltage- or transmitter-gated channels in the neocortex or thalamus lead to SWDs.\n\nResultsWe found that a selective increase in the tonic {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA-A) inhibition of first order thalamocortical (TC) neurons or a selective decrease in cortical phasic GABA-A inhibition are sufficient to generate [~]4 Hz SWDs (as in humans) that invariably start in neocortical territories. Decreasing the leak conductance of higher order TC neurons leads to [~]7 Hz SWDs (as in rodent models) while maintaining sleep spindles at 7-14 Hz.\n\nConclusionBy challenging key features of current mechanistic views, this simulated ictal corticothalamic activity provides novel understanding of ASs and makes key testable predictions.",

Here, we provide direct empirical support by driving visual neuronal responses with oscillating stimuli. We superimposed two orthogonal grating stimuli of temporally oscillating intensities, whose phase relations were precisely controlled. The leading stimulus was perceived as oscillating more intensely. This held for phase leads of a few milliseconds, and for each participant and almost every trial.

    "abstract": "Excitability--the ability to fire action potentials--is a signature feature of neurons. How neurons become excitable during development, and whether excitability is an intrinsic property of neurons or requires signaling from glial cells, remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that Schwann cells, the most abundant glia in the peripheral nervous system, promote somatosensory neuron excitability during development. We find that Schwann cells secrete prostaglandin E2, which is necessary and sufficient to induce developing somatosensory neurons to express normal levels of voltage-gated sodium channels and fire action potential trains. Inactivating this signaling pathway specifically in Schwann cells selectively impairs the maturation of nociceptor and proprioceptor somatosensory neuron subtypes, leading to corresponding sensory defects in thermoception, inflammatory pain, and proprioception. Our studies thus reveal a cell non-autonomous mechanism by which glia regulate neuronal excitability to enable the development of normal sensory functions.",

Transcriptomics and further pathway manipulation revealed that glutamate simulation of NSCs relied on EAAT1 transport-stimulated lipogenesis.

    "abstract": "Humans possess the ability to evaluate their confidence in a range of different decisions. In this study, we investigated the computational processes that underlie confidence judgements and the extent to which these computations are the same for perceptual decisions in the visual and auditory modalities. Participants completed two versions of a categorisation task with visual or auditory stimuli and made confidence judgements about their category decisions. In each modality, we varied both evidence strength, (i.e., the strength of the evidence for a particular category) and sensory uncertainty (i.e., the intensity of the sensory signal). We evaluated several classes of models which formalise the mapping of evidence strength and sensory uncertainty to confidence in different ways: 1) unscaled evidence strength models, 2) scaled evidence strength models, and 3) Bayesian models. Our model comparison results showed that across tasks and modalities, participants take evidence strength and sensory uncertainty into account in a way that is consistent with the scaled evidence strength class. Notably, the Bayesian class provided a relatively poor account of the data across modalities, particularly in the more complex categorisation task. Our findings suggest that a common process is used for evaluating confidence in perceptual decisions across domains, but that the parameter settings governing the process are tuned differently in each modality. Overall, our results highlight the impact of sensory uncertainty on confidence and the unity of metacognitive processing across sensory modalities.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this study, we investigated the computational processes that describe how people derive a sense of confidence in their decisions. In particular, we determined whether the computations that underlie the evaluation of confidence for a visual decision are the same as those for an auditory decision. We tested a range of different models from 3 distinct classes which make different predictions about the computations that are used. We found that a single class of models provided the best account of confidence, suggesting a common process for evaluating confidence across sensory modalities. Even though these computations are governed by the same general process, our results suggest that the process is still fine-tuned within each modality.",

Here, we interrogated PAC channel gating using its unique bidirectional modulator C77304 as a pharmacological probe. C77304 activated the PAC channel by acting on its proton gating, while simultaneously inhibiting channel activity at higher doses, through interaction with two modulatory sites with different affinities and state-dependence. Excitingly, we revealed that PAC undergoes intrinsic proton gating-independent voltage activation, which was defined by an ion-flux gating mechanism. Scanning-mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation confirmed that E181, E257, and E261 in human PAC form the primary proton sensors, as alanine mutations eliminated the channels proton gating while sparing the voltage-dependent gating.
