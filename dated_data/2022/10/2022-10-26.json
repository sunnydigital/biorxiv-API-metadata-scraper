    "abstract": "A key question in auditory neuroscience is to what extent are brain regions functionally specialized for processing specific sound features such as sound location and identity. In auditory cortex, correlations between neural activity and sounds support both the specialization of distinct cortical subfields, and encoding of multiple sound features within individual cortical areas. However, few studies have tested the contribution of auditory cortex to hearing in multiple contexts. Here we determined the role of ferret primary auditory cortex in both spatial and non-spatial hearing by reversibly inactivating the middle ectosylvian gyrus during behavior using cooling (n=2) or optogenetics (n=1). In optogenetic experiments, we utilized the mDLx promoter to express Channelrhodopsin 2 in GABAergic interneurons and confirmed both viral expression (n=2) and light-driven suppression of spiking activity in auditory cortex, recorded using Neuropixels under anesthesia (n=465 units from 2 additional untrained ferrets). Cortical inactivation impaired vowel discrimination in co-located noise, but not in clean conditions, or when the temporally coincident vowel and noise were spatially separated by 180{degrees}. Testing the ferrets implanted with cooling loops in a sound localization task confirmed that deficits in spatial hearing arose from inactivation of the same region of auditory cortex that was implicated in vowel discrimination in noise. Our results are consistent with single unit recordings in primary auditory cortex showing mixed selectivity for spatial and non-spatial features of sound and suggest a contribution of this region to multiple forms of hearing necessary for auditory scene analysis.\n\nSignificance StatementNeurons in primary auditory cortex are often sensitive to the location and identity of sounds. Here we inactivated auditory cortex during spatial and non- spatial listening tasks using cooling, or optogenetics. Auditory cortical inactivation impaired multiple behaviors, demonstrating a role in both the analysis of sound location and identity and confirming a functional contribution of mixed selectivity observed in neural activity. Parallel optogenetic experiments in two additional untrained ferrets linked behavior to physiology by demonstrating that expression of Channelrhodopsin 2 permitted rapid light-driven suppression of auditory cortical activity recorded under anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "The specimen-induced aberration has been a major factor limiting the imaging depth of single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). Here, we report the application of label-free wavefront sensing adaptive optics to SMLM for deep-tissue super-resolution imaging. The proposed system measures complex tissue aberrations from intrinsic reflectance rather than fluorescence emission and physically corrects the wavefront distortion more than three-fold stronger than the previous limit. This enables us to resolve sub-diffraction morphologies of cilia and oligodendrocytes in whole intact zebrafish as well as dendritic spines in thick mouse brain tissues at the depth of up to 102 m with localization number enhancement by up to 37 times and localization precision comparable to aberration-free samples. The proposed approach can expand the application range of SMLM to intact animals that cause the loss of localization points owing to severe tissue aberrations.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs), which are typical antigen-presenting cells, localize to various sites in the body, particularly the front line of infection as sentinels, and are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. Although the functions of DCs, such as pathogen-induced cytokine production and antigen-specific T cell activation, are important for host defenses against infection and tumorigenesis, the hyper- and/or extended activation of DCs leads to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In the present study, {beta}-damascone, a major ingredient of rose fragrance, was selected from an aroma library as a candidate compound that suppresses antigen-induced immune responses. {beta}-Damascone inhibited the functions of DCs, including the antigen-dependent proliferation of T cells, DC-induced Th1 development, and the TLR ligand-induced production of inflammatory cytokines by DCs. The {beta}-damascone treatment also increased the protein level of the transcription factor NRF2, which plays key roles in antioxidant responses, and the transcription of Hmox1, a target gene of NRF2, in DCs. Nrf2-/- DCs induced Th1-development and produced large amount of IL-12p40 even in the presence of {beta}-damascone, whereas these functions by Nrf2+/- DCs were inhibited by {beta}-damascone under the same conditions. The intake of {beta}-damascone suppressed ear swelling in contact hypersensitivity (CHS) model mice, but not in CHS-induced Nrf2-/- mice. Collectively, the present results indicate the potential of the rose aroma compound {beta}-damascone, which suppresses DC-mediated immune responses by activating the NRF2 pathway in DCs, for the prevention and/or attenuation of immune-mediated diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCD4+ T cells are key contributors to cancer immune surveillance. However, means to effectively harness CD4+ T cell help for cancer immunotherapy are lacking, and antitumor mechanisms of CD4+ T cells remain crudely defined.\n\nMethodsThe impact of polio immunization on polio virotherapy was tested in syngeneic murine melanoma and breast cancer models. Antitumor effects of polio and tetanus toxoid antigens were assessed in polio and tetanus immunized mice. T and B cell knockout mice, CD4+ T cell adoptive transfer, and eosinophil depletion demonstrated cell-type specific contributions to the antitumor efficacy of polio recall. Phenotyping of adoptively transferred OT-I (OVA-specific) T cells in B16-OVA tumor bearing mice, as well as adoptive transfer of T cells to naive tumor-bearing recipients, measured the impact of intratumor polio/tetanus recall on antitumor T cell immunity. Pan-cancer human transcriptome data sets were queried to test associations between eosinophils and Tregs; cytokine profiles of polio and tetanus recall were defined in human peripheral blood of healthy donors and cancer patients; CD40L blockade was used to determine dependency of recall antigen therapy on CD40:CD40L signaling.\n\nResultsPrior vaccination against poliovirus substantially bolstered the antitumor efficacy of polio virotherapy in mice, and intratumor recall of poliovirus or tetanus immunity delayed tumor growth in a manner complemented by pattern recognition receptor agonist therapy and PD1 blockade. Intratumor recall antigens augmented antitumor T cell function, and caused marked tumor infiltration of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and eosinophils, coinciding with decreased proportions of intratumor Tregs. Antitumor effects of recall antigens were mediated by CD4+ T cells, independent of CD40L signaling, and were dependent on both eosinophils and CD8+ T cells. Human PBMCs mounted diverse cytokine/chemokine responses, which were not impaired in patients with advanced cancer, and an inverse relationship between eosinophil and Treg signatures was observed across TCGA cancer types.\n\nConclusionThis work defines cancer immunotherapy potential of childhood vaccines, reveals their utility to engage CD4+ T cell help for antitumor CD8+ T cells, and implicates eosinophils as antitumor effectors of CD4+ T cells.",

Ocean warming and acidification are already impacting benthic species with carbonate skeletons, but the magnitude of these changes to species and ecosystems remains largely unknown. Here we provide the largest carbonate mineralogical dataset to date for Southern Ocean bryozoans, which are diverse, abundant and important as carbonate producers, thus making them excellent for monitoring the effects of ocean warming and acidification. To improve our understanding of how bryozoans might respond to ocean warming and acidification, we assess latitudinal and seafloor temperature patterns of skeletal mineralogy using bryozoan species occurrences together with temperature data for the first time. Our findings, combining new mineralogical data with published data from warmer regions, show that the proportions of high-Mg calcite and bimineralic species increase significantly towards lower latitudes and with increasing seawater temperature. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that seawater temperature is likely a significant driver of variations in bryozoan mineralogy at a global scale.",

    "abstract": "RNA structure is conformationally dynamic, and accurate all-atom tertiary (3D) structure modeling of RNA remains challenging with the prevailing tools. Secondary structure (2D) information is the standard prerequisite for most RNA 3D modeling. Despite several 2D and 3D structure prediction tools proposed in recent years, one of the challenges is to choose the best combination for accurate RNA 3D structure prediction. Here, we benchmarked seven small RNA PDB structures (40 to 90 nucleotides) with different topologies to understand the effects of different 2D structure predictions on the accuracy of 3D modeling. The current study explores the blind challenge of 2D to 3D conversions and highlights the performances of de novo RNA 3D modeling from their predicted 2D structure constraints. Our results show that conformational sampling-based methods such as SimRNA and IsRNA1 depend less on 2D accuracy, whereas motif-based methods account for 2D evidence. Our observations illustrate the disparities in available 3D and 2D prediction methods and may further offer insights into developing topology-specific or family-specific RNA structure prediction pipelines.",

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed as a framework that solves a discrete-time optimal control problem cast as a Markov Decision Process. We focus on an integrative framework powered by a model-free deep RL method that can address different flavours of the control problem (e.g., with or without control inputs; attractor state or a subset of the state space as the target domain). The method is agnostic to the distribution of probabilities for the next state, hence it does not use the probability transition matrix. The time complexity is only linear on the time steps, or interactions between the agent (deep RL) and the environment (PBN), during training. Indeed, we explore the scalability of the deep RL approach to (set) stabilization of large-scale PBNs and demonstrate successful control on large networks, including a metastatic melanoma PBN with 200 nodes.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers are essential in defining cell fates through the control of cell type specific gene expression. Enhancer activation is a multi-step process involving chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers including the monomethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me1) by MLL3 (KMT2C) and MLL4 (KMT2D). MLL3/4 are thought to be critical for enhancer activation and cognate gene expression including through the recruitment of acetyltransferases for H3K27. Here we test this model by evaluating the impact of MLL3/4 loss on chromatin and transcription during early embryonic stem cell differentiation. We find that MLL3/4 activity is required at most if not all sites that gain or lose H3K4me1 but is largely dispensable at sites that remain stably methylated during this transition. This requirement extends to H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at most transitional sites. However, many sites gain H3K27ac independent of MLL3/4 or H3K4me1 including enhancers regulating key factors in early differentiation. Furthermore, despite the failure to gain active histone marks at thousands of enhancers, transcriptional activation of nearby genes is largely unaffected, thus uncoupling the regulation of these chromatin events from transcriptional changes during this transition. These data challenge current models of enhancer activation and imply distinct mechanisms between stable and dynamically changing enhancers. Collectively, our study highlights gaps in knowledge about the steps and epistatic relationships of enzymes necessary for enhancer activation and cognate gene transcription.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. A subgroup of high-risk patients is characterized by aberrations in the chromatin remodeller ATRX that is encoded by 35 exons. In contrast to other pediatric cancer where ATRX point mutations are most frequent, multi-exon deletions (MEDs) are the most frequent type of ATRX aberrations in neuroblastoma. Of these MEDs 75% are predicted to produce in-frame fusion proteins, suggesting a potential gain-of-function effect compared to nonsense mutations. For neuroblastoma there are only a few patient-derived ATRX aberrant models. Therefore, we created isogenic ATRX aberrant models using CRISPR-Cas9 in several neuroblastoma cell lines and one tumoroid and performed total RNA-sequencing on these and on the patient-derived model. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed decreased expression of genes related to both ribosome biogenesis and several metabolic process in our isogenic ATRX exon 2-10 MED model systems, the patient-derived MED models and in tumor data containing two patients with an ATRX exon 2-10 MED. Interestingly, for our isogenic ATRX knock-out and exon 2-13 MED models GSEA revealed an opposite expression pattern characterized by increased expression of genes related to ribosome biogenesis and several metabolic process. Our validations confirmed a potential role of ATRX in the regulation of ribosome homeostasis. In this manner we identified two distinct molecular expression patterns within ATRX aberrant neuroblastomas with important implications for the need of distinct treatment regimens.",

How mycobacteria cause bone loss remains elusive, but direct bone infection may not be required.

IFNg produced during infection enhanced macrophage TNFa secretion, which in turn increased the production of serum amyloid A (SAA) 3. Saa3 expression was upregulated in the bone of both M. avium- and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice and SAA proteins were increased in the serum of patients with active tuberculosis. Furthermore, the increased SAA levels seen in active tuberculosis patients correlated with altered serum bone turnover markers. Additionally, human SAA proteins impaired bone matrix deposition and increased osteoclastogenesis in vitro.

    "abstract": "Animal models are used in preclinical trials to test vaccines, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory drug therapies against SARS-CoV-2. However, these drugs often do not produce equivalent results in human clinical trials. Here, we show how different animal models infected with some of the most clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants, WA1/2020, B.1.617.2/Delta, B.1.1.529/Omicron and BA5.2/Omicron, have independent outcomes. We show that in mice, B.1.617.2 is more pathogenic, followed by WA1, while B.1.1.529 showed an absence of clinical signs. Only B.1.1.529 was able to infect C57BL/6J mice, which lack the human ACE2 receptor. B.1.1.529-infected ACE2 mice had different T cell profiles compared to infected K18-hACE2 mice, while viral shedding profiles and viral titers in lungs were similar between the ACE2 and the C57BL/6J mice. These data suggest B.1.1.529 virus adaptation to a new host and shows that asymptomatic carriers can accumulate and shed virus. Next, we show how B.1.617.2, WA1 and BA5.2/Omicron have similar viral replication kinetics, pathogenicity, and viral shedding profiles in hamsters, demonstrating that the increased pathogenicity of B.1.617.2 observed in mice is host-dependent. Overall, these findings suggest that small animal models are useful to parallel human clinical data, but the experimental design places an important role in interpreting the data.\n\nIMPORTANCEThere is a need to investigate SARS-CoV-2 variants phenotypes in different animal models due to the lack of reproducible outcomes when translating experiments to the human population. Our findings highlight the correlation of clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants in animal models with human infections.

    "abstract": "Many developmental processes depend on precise temporal control of gene expression. We have previously established a theoretical framework for regulatory strategies that can govern such high temporal precision, but experimental validation of these predictions was still lacking. Here, we use the time-dependent expression of a Wnt receptor that controls neuroblast migration in C. elegans as a tractable system to study a robust, cell-intrinsic timing mechanism in vivo. Single molecule mRNA quantification showed that the expression of the receptor increases non-linearly, a dynamic that is predicted to enhance timing precision over an unregulated, linear increase in timekeeper abundance. We show that this upregulation depends on transcriptional activation, providing in vivo evidence for a model in which the timing of receptor expression is regulated through an accumulating activator that triggers expression when a specific threshold is reached. This timing mechanism acts across a cell division that occurs in the neuroblast lineage, and is influenced by the asymmetry of the division. Finally, we show that positive feedback of receptor expression through the canonical Wnt pathway enhances temporal precision. We conclude that robust cell-intrinsic timing can be achieved by combining regulation and feedback of the timekeeper gene.",

    "abstract": "A feasible method to analyse fruit at the plant considering its position, size, and maturity are requested in precise production management. The present study proposes the employment of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to measure the position, quality-related size, and maturity-related chlorophyll of fruit.\n\nDuring fuit development, apples were analysed in the laboratory (n = 270) with two LiDAR laser scanners measuring at 660 and 905 nm. From the two 3D point clouds, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. The correlation analysis with chemically analysed fruit chlorophyll content showed R2 = 0.81 and 0.02 % RMSE.\n\nThe method was validated on 3D point clouds of 12 fruit trees in the orchard. Segmentation of individual apples was carried out during fruit development on five measuring dates, validated with manual rating (n = 4632). The non-invasively obtained field data showed good calibration performance capturing fruit position, fruit size, fruit NDVI of R2 = 0.99, R2 = 0.97, R2 = 0.71, respectively, considering the related reference data.\n\nFor 3D data of leaves, earlier shown analysis of leaf area and leaf chlorophyll by means of LiDAR was confirmed. The new approach of non-invasive laser scanning provided physiologically and agronomically valuable time series data on differences in fruit chlorophyll affected by the leaf area to fruit ratio, as well as differences of fruit chlorophyll in different growing position at the tree. Resulting, the method provides a tool for production management, e.g. crop load management, and integration in harvest robots.",

    "abstract": "The inhibition of shoot branching by the growing shoot tip of plants, termed apical dominance, was originally thought to be mediated by auxin. Recently the importance of the shoot tip sink strength during apical dominance has re-emerged with recent studies highlighting roles for sugars in promoting branching. This raises many unanswered questions on the relative roles of auxin and sugars in apical dominance. Here we show that auxin regulation of cytokinins, which promote branching, is significant only after an initial stage of branching we call bud release. During this early bud release stage, rapid cytokinin increases are associated with enhanced sugars. Auxin may also act through strigolactones which have been shown to suppress branching after decapitation, but here we show that strigolactones do not have a significant effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation. We report here that when sucrose or cytokinin is abundant, strigolactones are less inhibitory during the bud release stage compared to later stages and that strigolactone treatment rapidly inhibits cytokinin accumulation in pea axillary buds of intact plants. After initial bud release, we find an important role of gibberellin in promoting sustained bud growth downstream of auxin. We are therefore able to suggest a model of apical dominance that integrates auxin, sucrose, strigolactones, cytokinins and gibberellins and describes differences in signalling across stages of bud release to sustained growth.",

    "abstract": "Making informed decisions in noisy environments requires integrating sensory information over time. However, recent work has suggested that it may be difficult to determine whether an animals decision-making strategy relies on evidence integration or not. In particular, strategies based on extrema-detection or random snapshots of the evidence stream may be difficult or even impossible to distinguish from classic evidence integration. Moreover, such non-integration strategies might be surprisingly common in experiments that aimed to study decisions based on integration. To determine whether temporal integration is central to perceptual decision making, we developed a new model-based approach for comparing temporal integration against alternative \"non-integration\" strategies for tasks in which the sensory signal is composed of discrete stimulus samples. We applied these methods to behavioral data from monkeys, rats, and humans performing a variety of sensory decision-making tasks. In all species and tasks, we found converging evidence in favor of temporal integration. First, in all observers across studies, the integration model better accounted for standard behavioral statistics such as psychometric curves and psychophysical kernels. Second, we found that sensory samples with large evidence do not contribute disproportionately to subject choices, as predicted by an extrema-detection strategy. Finally, we provide a direct confirmation of temporal integration by showing that the sum of both early and late evidence contributed to observer decisions. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence suggesting that temporal integration is an ubiquitous feature in mammalian perceptual decision-making. Our study also highlights the benefits of using experimental paradigms where the temporal stream of sensory evidence is controlled explicitly by the experimenter, and known precisely by the analyst, to characterize the temporal properties of the decision process.",

    "abstract": "IntroThe number of studies on SARS-CoV-2 published on a daily basis is constantly increasing, in an attempt to understand and address the challenges posed by the pandemic in a better way. Most of these studies also include a phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 as background context, always taking into consideration the latest data in order to construct an updated tree. However, some of these studies have also revealed the difficulties of inferring a reliable phylogeny. [13] have shown that reliable phylogeny is an inherently complex task due to the large number of highly similar sequences, given the relatively low number of mutations evident in each sequence.\n\nMotivationFrom this viewpoint, there is indeed a challenge and an opportunity in identifying the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in order to assist the phylogenetic analysis process as well as support researchers in keeping track of the virus and the course of its characteristic mutations, and in finding patterns of the emerging mutations themselves and the interactions between them. The research question is formulated as follows: Detecting new patterns of co-occurring mutations beyond the strain-specific / strain-defining ones, in SARS-CoV-2 data, through the application of ML methods.\n\nAimGoing beyond the traditional phylogenetic approaches, we will be designing and implementing a clustering method that will effectively create a dendrogram of the involved sequences, based on a feature space defined on the present mutations, rather than the entire sequence. Ultimately, this ML method is tested out in sequences retrieved from public databases and validated using the available metadata as labels. The main goal of the project is to design, implement and evaluate a software that will automatically detect and cluster relevant mutations, that could potentially be used to identify trends in emerging variants.\n\nContacttasos1109@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines prevent symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death of the disease. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants raises concerns of reduced vaccine effectiveness and increased risk of infection. Repeated homologous booster in elderly individuals and immunocompromised patients is considered to solve severe form of disease caused by new SARS-CoV-2 variants but cannot protect completely against breakthrough infection. In our previous study we assessed the immunogenicity of an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing SARS-CoV-2-S1 (Ad5.S1) in mice, resulting in that a single immunization with Ad5.S1, via subcutaneously injection or intranasal delivery, induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses [1]. As a follow up study, here we showed that vaccinated mice had high titers of anti-S1 antibodies at one year after vaccination compared to PBS immunized mice. Furthermore, one booster dose of non-adjuvanted recombinant S1Beta (rS1Beta) subunit vaccine was effective in stimulating strong long-lived S1-specific immune responses and inducing significantly high neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan, Beta, and Delta strain with 3.6- to 19.5-fold change increases. Importantly, the booster dose elicits cross-reactive antibody responses resulting in ACE2 binding inhibition against spike of SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Zeta, Kappa, New York, India) as early as two-week post-boost injection, persisting over 28 weeks after a booster vaccination. Interestingly, levels of neutralizing antibodies were correlated with not only level of S1-binding IgG but also level of ACE2 inhibition in the before- and after-booster serum samples. Our findings show that S1 recombinant protein subunit vaccine candidate as a booster has potential to offer cross-neutralization against broad variants, and has important implications for vaccine control of new emerging breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 variants in elderly individuals primed with adenovirus-based vaccine like AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal coronaviruses have been circulating widely in the human population for many years. With increasing age, humans are more likely to have been exposed to these viruses and to have developed immunity against them. It has been hypothesized that this immunity to seasonal coronaviruses may provide partial protection against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it has also been shown that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination induces a back-boosting effects against the spike proteins of seasonal betacoronaviruses. In this study, we tested if immunity to the seasonal coronavirus spikes from OC43, HKU1, 229E or NL63 would confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model, and whether pre-existing immunity against these spikes would weaken the protection afforded by mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. We found that mice vaccinated with the seasonal coronavirus spike proteins had no increased protection as compared to the negative controls. While a negligible back-boosting effect against betacoronavirus spike proteins was observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was no negative original antigenic sin-like effect on the immune response and protection induced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in animals with pre-existing immunity to seasonal coronavirus spike proteins.\n\nImportanceThe impact that immunity against seasonal coronaviruses has on both susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as on COVID-19 vaccination is unclear.

    "abstract": "In the event of DNA damage, the cell cycle can be slowed or halted to allow for DNA repair. The mechanisms by which this occurs are well-characterised in interphase, although the mechanisms underpinning mitosis slowing in response to damage are unclear. Canonical checkpoints and DNA repair pathways are largely repressed in mitosis, and whilst there is some level of mitotic DNA synthesis and repair, the bulk of DNA damage is processed for post-mitotic repair. How the decision is made between mitotic DNA repair and post-mitotic DNA repair is not known. We have identified the antioxidant enzyme Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) as an essential factor mediating delayed mitotic progression in response to DNA damage and replication stress. Cells depleted of SOD1 no longer exhibit DNA damage dependent mitotic delay, and display increased levels of damaged centromeres and mitotic defects. Whilst reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing agents also lead to SOD1-dependent mitotic delay, intracellular ROS levels do not correlate with mitotic arrest. SOD1 appears to play an important role in DNA repair in interphase and is recruited to the nucleus in response to DNA damage. In addition to control of mitotic progression in response to genotoxic stress, SOD1 also plays a major role in mitotic DNA synthesis. SOD- depleted cells show reduced levels of mitotic EdU incorporation in response to either replication stress or DNA breaks, seemingly in tandem with Rad51 andSOD1-depletion induced mitotic progression in the presence of DNA breaks is Rad52-dependent. We suggest that there are two responses to DNA breaks in mitosis; either arrest and mitotic repair or progression and post-mitotic repair; and these two pathways exist in a fine balance, controlled by a signaling cascade involving SOD1.",

    "abstract": "Our actions and choices sometimes seem driven by our \"needs\", sometimes by our \"wants\", and sometimes by both. Needing is related to deprivation of something biologically significant, and wanting is linked to reward prediction and dopamine and usually has more power on behavioral activation than need states alone. Why sometimes there is an association and sometimes a dissociation between needing and wanting remains largely unknown. This paper aims to clarify the relations between needing and wanting, from the perspective of a normative framework to understand brain and cognition; namely, active inference. In this approach, needing is related to a deviation from preferred states that living things tend to occupy in order to reduce their surprise, while wanting is related to the precision over policies that lead to preferred (e.g., rewarding) states. Also, we hypothesized that needing exerts a pervasive effect that is embodied on the organism. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate the interplay between needing and wanting systems. Specifically, our simulations show that when need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states is enhanced, independently of wanting (or reward prediction), therefore showing a dissociation between needing and wanting. Furthermore, the simulations show that when need states increase, the value of cues that signal reward achievement and the precision of the policies that lead to preferred states increase, suggesting that needs can amplify the value of a reward and its wanting. Taken together, our model and simulations help clarify the directional and underlying influence of need states separately from wanting and reward prediction; and how the same underlying influence of need amplifies wanting, i.e. increases the precision of available reward cues that lead to the preferred state.",

However, whether YAP forms condensates under other signals, how YAP condensates organize and function, and how YAP condensates activate transcription in general are unknown. Here, we report that endogenous YAP forms sub-micron scale condensates in response to Hippo pathway regulation and actin cytoskeletal tension. The transcription factor TEAD1 actively stabilizes YAP condensates, which also recruit BRD4, a coactivator that is enriched at active enhancers. Using single molecule tracking, we found that YAP condensates slowed YAP diffusion within condensate boundaries, a possible mechanism for promoting YAP target search.

These methods typically assume only incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. Given that phylogenetic networks can be arbitrarily complex, these methods might compensate for model misspecification by increasing the number of dimensions beyond the true value. Herein, we explore the effect of potential model misspecification, including the negligence of gene tree estimation error (GTEE) and assumption of a single substitution rate for all genomic loci, on the accuracy of phylogenetic network inference using both simulated and biological data. In particular, we assess the accuracy of estimated phylogenetic networks as well as test statistics for determining whether a network is the correct evolutionary history, as opposed to the simpler model that is a tree.\n\nWe found that while GTEE negatively impacts the performance of test statistics to determine the \"tree-ness\" of the evolutionary history of a data set, running those tests on triplets of taxa and correcting for multiple testing significantly ameliorates the problem. We also found that accounting for substitution rate heterogeneity improves the reliability of full Bayesian inference methods of phylogenetic networks, whereas summary statistic methods are robust to GTEE and rate heterogeneity, though currently require manual inspection to determine the network complexity.",

A verbal theory developed by Pardo-Manuel de Villena and Sapienza argues that morphology-biased segregation in female meiosis explains the corresponding directional evolution in favor of one or the other chromosome form within species, and moreover, periodic reversals of meiotic spindle asymmetry explain the pattern of bimodality observed among species. Here I investigate a population genetic model in which I assume that the direction of the spindle asymmetry is under the control of a modifier gene, either linked or unlinked to a focal karyotypic mutant (linkage being to a centric fusion, say), and I derive the corresponding invasion conditions for the modifier-centric-fusion gene complex. I demonstrate that the scenario put forth in the verbal theory can be explained by a two-step process in which (1) a centric-fusion invades to fixation while the linked modifier winds up at an intermediate frequency by hitchhiking, and then (2) subsequent fixations of unlinked centric fusions occur. Via numerical iteration of the model, I demonstrate that the typical post-hitchhiking frequency of the linked modifier (from step 1) is broadly sufficient for subsequent unlinked invasions (step 2). Sign-reversing modifier evolution is therefore concluded to be a plausible mechanism instantiating the principles of a female drive theory of karyotype evolution.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics (PGx)-guided drug treatment is one of the cornerstones of personalized medicine. However, the genes involved in drug response are highly complex and known to carry many (rare) variants. Current technologies (short-read sequencing and SNP panels) are limited in their ability to resolve these genes and characterize all variants. Moreover, these technologies cannot always phase variants to their allele of origin. Recent advance in long-read sequencing technologies have shown promise in resolving these problems. Here we present a long-read sequencing panel-based approach for PGx using PacBio HiFi sequencing.\n\nA capture based approach was developed using a custom panel of clinically-relevant pharmacogenes including up- and downstream regions. A total of 27 samples were sequenced and panel accuracy was determined using benchmarking variant calls for 3 Genome in a Bottle samples and GeT-RM star(*)-allele calls for 21 samples..\n\nThe coverage was uniform for all samples with an average of 94% of bases covered at >30x. When compared to benchmarking results, accuracy was high with an average F1 score of 0.89 for INDELs and 0.98 for SNPs. Phasing was good with an average of 68% the target region phased (compared to ~20% for short-reads) and an average phased haploblock size of 6.6kbp. Using Aldy 4, we compared our variant calls to GeT-RM data for 8 genes (CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, SLCO1B1, TPMT), and observed highly accurate star(*)-allele calling with 98.2% concordance (165/168 calls), with only one discordance in CYP2C9 leading to a different predicted phenotype.\n\nWe have shown that our long-read panel-based approach results in high accuracy and target phasing for SNVs as well as for clinical star(*)-alleles.",

    "abstract": "The common human single nucleotide polymorphism rs3820282 is associated with multiple phenotypes ranging from gestational length to likelihood of endometriosis and ovarian cancer and can thus serve as a paradigm for a highly pleiotropic genetic variant. Pleiotropy makes it challenging to assign specific causal roles to particular genetic variants. Deleterious mutations in multifunctional genes may cause either the co-occurrence of multiple disorders in the same individuals (i.e., syndromes), or be repeatedly associated with a variety of disorders in a population. Moreover, the adverse effects can occur in combination with advantages in other traits, maintaining high frequencies of deleterious alleles in the population. To reveal the causal role of this specific SNP, we investigated the molecular mechanisms affected by rs3820282 in mice. We have shown previously that rs3820282 introduces a high affinity estrogen receptor 1 binding site at the Wnt4 locus. Having introduced this nucleotide substitution into the homologous site of the mouse genome by CRISPR/Cas 9 we show that this change causes a specific upregulation of Wnt4 transcription in the endometrial stromal cells during the preovulatory estrogen peak in late proestrus. Transcriptomic analysis of the whole uterus reveals broad systemic effects on uterine gene expression, including downregulation of proliferation and induction of many progesterone-regulated pro-implantation genes. The effect on proliferation is limited to the luminal epithelium, whereas other effects involve the uterine stromal compartment. We suggest that in the uterus, these changes could contribute to increased permissiveness to embryo invasion. Yet in other estrogen-responsive tissues, the same changes potentially lead to decreased resistance to invasion by cancer cells and endometriotic foci. A single molecular effect of rs3820282 on Wnt4 expression may thus underlie the various associated phenotypic effects.",

    "abstract": "A goal of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate the causal effects of alleles carried by an individual on that individual ( direct genetic effects). Typical GWAS designs, however, are susceptible to confounding due to gene-environment correlation and non-random mating (population stratification and assortative mating). Family-based GWAS, in contrast, is robust to such confounding since it uses random, within-family genetic variation. When both parents are genotyped, a regression controlling for parental genotype provides the most powerful approach. However, parental genotypes are often missing. We have previously shown that imputing the genotypes of missing parent(s) can increase power for estimation of direct genetic effects over using genetic differences between siblings. We extend the imputation method, which previously only applied to samples with at least one genotyped sibling or parent, to  singletons (individuals without any genotyped relatives). By including singletons, the effective sample size for estimation of direct effects can be increased by up to 50%. We apply this method to 408,254  White British individuals from the UK Biobank, obtaining an effective sample size increase of between 25% and 43% (depending upon phenotype) by including 368,629 singletons. While this approach maximizes power, it can be biased when there is strong population structure. We therefore introduce an imputation based estimator that is robust to population structure and more powerful than other robust estimators. We implement our estimators in the software package snipar using an efficient linear-mixed model (LMM) specified by a sparse genetic relatedness matrix. We examine the bias and variance of different family-based and standard GWAS estimators theoretically and in simulations with differing levels of population structure, enabling researchers to choose the appropriate approach depending on their research goals.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres in the legume genera Pisum and Lathyrus exhibit unique morphological characteristics, including extended primary constrictions and multiple separate domains of centromeric chromatin. These so-called metapolycentromeres resemble an intermediate form between monocentric and holocentric types, and therefore provide a great opportunity for studying the transitions between different types of centromere organizations. However, because of the exceedingly large and highly repetitive nature of metapolycentromeres, highly contiguous assemblies needed for these studies are lacking. Here, we report on the assembly and analysis of a 177.6 Mb region of pea (Pisum sativum) chromosome 6, including the 81.6 Mb centromere region (CEN6) and adjacent chromosome arms. Genes, DNA methylation profiles, and most of the repeats were uniformly distributed within the centromere, and their densities in CEN6 and chromosome arms were similar. The exception was an accumulation of satellite DNA in CEN6, where it formed multiple arrays up to 2 Mb in length. Centromeric chromatin, characterized by the presence of the CENH3 protein, was predominantly associated with arrays of three different satellite repeats; however, five other satellites present in CEN6 lacked CENH3. The presence of CENH3 chromatin was found to determine the spatial distribution of the respective satellites during the cell cycle. Finally, oligo-FISH painting experiments, performed using probes specifically designed to label the genomic regions corresponding to CEN6 in Pisum, Lathyrus, and Vicia species, revealed that metapolycentromeres evolved via the expansion of centromeric chromatin into neighboring chromosomal regions and the accumulation of novel satellite repeats. However, in some of these species, centromere evolution also involved chromosomal translocations and centromere repositioning.\n\nSignificanceDespite their conserved function, plant centromeres exhibit considerable variation in their morphology and sequence composition. For example, centromere activity is restricted to a single region in monocentric chromosomes, but is distributed along the entire chromosome length in holocentric chromosomes. The principles of centromere evolution that led to this variation are largely unknown, partly due to the lack of high-quality centromere assemblies. Here, we present an assembly of the pea metapolycentromere, a unique type of centromere that represents an intermediate stage between monocentric and holocentric organizations. This study not only provides a detailed insight into sequence organization, but also reveals possible mechanisms for the formation of the metapolycentromere through the spread of centromeric chromatin and the accumulation of satellite DNA.",

    "abstract": "Most bats catch nocturnal prey during active flight guided by echolocation but some species depart from this ancestral behaviour to capture ground prey using passive listening. Here, we explore the costs and benefits of these hunting transitions by combining high-resolution biologging data and DNA metabarcoding to quantify the relative contributions of aerial and ground prey to the total food intake of wild greater mouse-eared bats. We show that these bats use both foraging strategies with similar average nightly captures of 25 small, aerial insects and 30 large, ground-dwelling insects per bat, but with higher capture success in air (78 % in air vs 30 % on ground). However, owing to the 3 to 20 times heavier ground prey, 85 % of the estimated nightly food acquisition comes from ground prey despite the 2.5 times higher failure rates. Further, we find that most bats use the same foraging strategy on a given night suggesting that bats adapt their hunting behaviour to weather and ground conditions. We conclude that prey switching matched to environmental dynamics plays a key role in covering the energy intake even in specialised predators.",

To better understand the underlying mechanisms driving the progression of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), we developed scaffold-free multi-cellular 3D cholangiocyte organoids (3D-CHO) using  primary liver cell lines derived from normal and PSC patients. Human liver samples from healthy donors and late-stage PSC patients were used to isolate  primary cholangiocytes (EPCAM+/CK-19+), liver endothelial cells (LECs, CD31+), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs, CD31-/CD68-/Desmin+/Vitamin A+). 3D-CHOs were formed using cholangiocytes:HSCs:LECs and kept viable for up to 1 month. Isolated primary cell lines and 3D-CHOs were further characterized by immunofluorescence (IF), qRT-PCR, and transmission electron microscopy. Gene expressions for cholangiocytes (SOX9, CFTR, EpCAM, AE, SCT, SCTR), fibrosis (ACTA2, COL1A1, DESMIN, TGF{beta}1), angiogenesis (PECAM, VEGF, CDH5, vWF), and inflammation (IL-6, TNF-) confirmed PSC phenotypes of 3D-CHOs. Since cholangiocytes develop a neuroendocrine phenotype and express neuromodulators, confocal-IF demonstrated that neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R, expressed by cholangiocytes and upregulated in PSC), was localized within CK-19+ cholangiocytes. Moreover, 3D-CHOs from PSC patients confirmed PSC phenotypes with upregulated NK-1R, tachykinin precursor 1, and downregulated membrane metalloendopeptidase. Our viable scaffold-free multiple-cell 3D-CHOs showed superiority as an in vitro model in mimicking PSC in vivo phenotypes compared to 2D cell culture, which can be used in PSC disease-related research.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has become a popular tool to study cis-regulatory element function. Yet efforts to design software for DL analyses in genomics that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) have fallen short of fully meeting these criteria. Here we present EUGENe (Elucidating the Utility of Genomic Elements with Neural Nets), a FAIR toolkit for the analysis of labeled sets of nucleotide sequences with DL. EUGENe consists of a set of modules that empower users to execute the key functionality of a DL workflow: 1) extracting, transforming and loading sequence data from many common file formats, 2) instantiating, initializing and training diverse model architectures, and 3) evaluating and interpreting model behavior. We designed EUGENe to be simple; users can develop workflows on new or existing datasets with two customizable Python objects, annotated sequence data (SeqData) and PyTorch models (BaseModel). The modularity and simplicity of EUGENe also make it highly extensible and we illustrate these principles through application of the toolkit to three predictive modeling tasks. First, we train and compare a set of built-in models along with a custom architecture for the accurate prediction of activities of plant promoters from STARR-seq data. Next, we apply EUGENe to an RNA binding prediction task and showcase how seminal model architectures can be retrained in EUGENe or imported from Kipoi. Finally, we train models to classify transcription factor binding by wrapping functionality from Janngu, which can efficiently extract sequences in BED file format from the human genome. We emphasize that the code used in each use case is simple, readable, and well documented (https://eugene-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). We believe that EUGENe represents a springboard toward a collaborative ecosystem for DL applications in genomics research. EUGENe is available for download on GitHub (https://github.com/cartercompbio/EUGENe) along with several introductory tutorials and for installation on PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/eugene-tools/).",

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamic flow in the spider duct induces conformational changes in dragline spider silk proteins (spidroins) and drives their assembly, but the underlying physical mechanisms are still elusive. Here we address this challenging multiscale problem with a complementary strategy of atomistic and coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with uniform flow. The conformational changes at the molecular level were analyzed for single tethered spider silk peptides. Uniform flow leads to coiled-to-stretch transitions and pushes alanine residues into {beta}-sheet and Poly-Proline II (PPII) conformations. Coarse-grained simulations of the assembly process of multiple semi-flexible block copolymers using multi-particle collision dynamics reveal that the spidroins aggregate faster but into low-order assemblies when they are less extended. At medium-to-large peptide extensions (50%-80%), assembly slows down and becomes reversible with frequent association and dissociation events, while spidroin alignment increases and alanine repeats form ordered regions. Our work highlights the role of flow in guiding silk self-assembly into tough fibers by enhancing alignment and kinetic reversibility, a mechanism likely relevant for other proteins whose function depends on hydrodynamic flow.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence imaging in combination with single-particle tracking analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to study and characterize the motion of proteins moving in biological media. One of the main challenges in this approach is to reliably distinguish between directed and diffusive transport, especially for short and often noisy trajectories showing distinct, time- and place-dependent modes of motility. In this contribution, we present a windowed Mean-Square Displacements classifier (wMSDc) that is able to reliably (i) identify periods of diffusive and directed transport, (ii) extract position-dependent diffusion coefficients and velocities, and (iii) identify the location of switches in direction or motility mode in short (< 50 time points) and noisy single-molecule trajectories. We compare the performance of this approach to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method and a Moment Scaling Spectrum based method (DC-MSS) previously published and show that, in most cases, its performance is superior. We present a wide range of applications: from the movement of whole organisms and cells to protein-DNA interactions in vitro and motor-protein dynamics in vivo.\n\nStatement of SignificanceExtracting quantitative parameters from single-particle trajectories is a challenging task, especially in biological samples, which often show a high degree of heterogeneity. Trajectories can reveal switches between different types of motion; directed, diffusive and sub-diffusive motion. Usually, the length of these trajectories and their localization precision are limited by the experimental conditions. Here, we present a novel approach to analyse single molecule trajectories, windowed Mean-Square Displacement classifier (wMSDc) to reliably distinguish between directed and diffusive transport in the short trajectories with a finite precision of localization and integration time typically obtained when imaging single fluorescent proteins in living cells or organisms. We show that, using simulated and a wide range of experimental trajectories, wMSDc is a reliable method to extract motility parameters such as diffusion coefficient and velocity.",

However, the features of this landscape remain poorly understood and cannot be revealed by human cancer genotyping alone. Here, we use a multiplexed, autochthonous mouse platform to model and quantify the initiation and growth of more than one hundred genotypes of lung tumors across four oncogenic contexts: KRAS G12D, KRAS G12C, BRAF V600E, and EGFR L858R. The resulting fitness landscape is rugged (the effect of tumor suppressor inactivation often switches between beneficial and deleterious depending on the oncogenic context), shows no evidence of diminishing-returns epistasis within variants of the same oncogene, and is inconsistent with expectations of a simple linear signaling relationship among these three oncogenes. Our findings suggest that tumor suppressor effects are strongly context-specific, which limits the set of evolutionary paths that can be taken through the fitness landscape.",

    "abstract": "The development of genetic modification techniques has led to the opening of a new era in cancer treatments that have been limited to conventional treatments such as chemotherapy. Since not only cancerous cells but also healthy cells are damaged by the drugs, intensive efforts are made to develop cancer-targeted techniques. The most promising approach is genetically modified CAR-T cell therapy. The high central memory T cell (Tcm) and stem cell-like memory T cell (Tscm) ratios in the CAR-T cell population increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Therefore, it is important to increase the populations of CAR-expressing Tcm and Tscm cells to ensure that CAR-T cells remain long-term and have cytotoxic (anti-tumor) efficacy. In this study, we aimed to improve CAR-T cell therapys time-dependent efficacy and stability, increasing the survival time and reducing the probability of cancer cell growth. To increase the subpopulation of Tcm and Tscm in CAR-T cells, we investigated to produce a long-term stable and cytotoxic efficient CAR-T cell by modifications in the cell activation-dependent production method using Phytohemagglutinin. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a lectin that binds to the membranes of T cells and increases metabolic activity and cell division, is studied to increase the Tcm and Tscm population. Although it is known that PHA significantly increases Tcm cells, B-lymphocyte antigen CD19 specific CAR-T cell expansion, its anti-cancer and memory capacity has not yet been tested compared to aCD3/aCD28. Two different types of CAR (aCD19 scFv CD8- (CD28 or 41BB)-CD3z-EGFRt) expressing T cells were generated and their immunogenic phenotype, exhausted phenotype, Tcm-Tscm populations, and cytotoxic activities were determined in this study. The proportion of T cell memory phenotype in the CAR-T cell populations generated by PHA was observed to be higher than that of aCD3/aCD28-amplified CAR-T cells with similar cytotoxic (anti-tumor) and higher proliferation capacity. Here, we show that PHA provides long-term and efficient CAR-T cell production, suggesting a potential alternative to aCD3/aCD28-amplified CAR-T cells.",

    "abstract": "Chemoresistance is one of the major causes of therapeutic failure and poor prognosis for breast cancer patients, especially for triple-negative breast cancer patients. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we identified novel functional roles of heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1), regulating the chemoresistance and ferroptotic cell death in breast cancer. Based on TCGA and GEO databases, HSPB1 expression was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients, which was considered as an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer. Functional assays revealed that HSPB1 could promote cancer growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, HSPB1 facilitated doxorubicin resistance through protecting breast cancer cells from drug-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, HSPB1 could bind with Ik{beta}- and promote its ubiquitination-mediated degradation, leading to increased nuclear translocation and activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. In addition, HSPB1 overexpression led to enhanced secretion of IL6, which further facilitated breast cancer progression. These findings revealed that HSPB1 upregulation might be a key driver to progression and chemoresistance through regulating ferroptosis in breast cancer, while targeting HSPB1 could be an effective strategy against breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) also called alcohol dependence is a major public health problem, which affects almost 10% of the worlds population. Baclofen as a selective GABAB receptor agonist has emerged as a promising drug for the treatment of AUD, however, its optimal dosage varies according to individuals, and its exposure-response relationship has not been well established yet. In this study, we use a principled Bayesian workflow to estimate the parameters of a pharmacokinetic (PK) population model from Baclofen administration to patients with AUD. By monitoring various convergence diagnostics, the probabilistic methodology is first validated on synthetic longitudinal datasets and then, applied to infer the PK model parameters based on the clinical data that were retrospectively collected from outpatients treated with oral Baclofen. We show that state-of-the-art advances in automatic Bayesian inference using self-tuning Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms with a leveraged level of information in priors provide accurate predictions on Baclofen plasma concentration in individuals. This approach may pave the way to render non-parametric HMC sampling methods sufficiently easy and reliable to use in clinical schedules for personalized treatment of AUD.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities experience continuous environmental changes, among which temperature fluctuations are arguably the most impacting. This is particularly important considering the ongoing global warming but also in the \"simpler\" context of seasonal variability of sea-surface temperature. Understanding how microorganisms react at the cellular level can improve our understanding of possible adaptations of microbial communities to a changing environment. In this work, we investigated which are the mechanisms through which metabolic homeostasis is maintained in a cold-adapted bacterium during growth at temperatures that differ widely (15 and 0{degrees}C). We have quantified its intracellular and extracellular central metabolomes together with changes occurring at the transcriptomic level in the same growth conditions. This information was then used to contextualize a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction and to provide a systemic understanding of cellular adaptation to growth at two different temperatures. Our findings indicate a strong metabolic robustness at the level of the main central metabolites, counteracted by a relatively deep transcriptomic reprogramming that includes changes in gene expression of hundreds of metabolic genes. We interpret this as a transcriptomic buffering of cellular metabolism, able to produce overlapping metabolic phenotypes despite the wide temperature gap. Moreover, we show that metabolic adaptation seems to be mostly played at the level of few key intermediates (e.g. phosphoenolpyruvate) and in the cross-talk between the main central metabolic pathways. Overall, our findings reveal a complex interplay at gene expression level that contributes to the robustness/resilience of core metabolism, also promoting the leveraging of state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary approaches to fully comprehend molecular adaptations to environmental fluctuations.",

To address this gap, we develop and compare fully automated deep learning algorithms to detect seizure activity on single channels, effectively quantifying spread when deployed across multiple channels. Across 275 seizures in 71 patients, we discover that the extent of seizure spread across the brain and the timing of seizure spread between temporal lobe regions is associated with both surgical outcomes and the brains structural connectivity between temporal lobes. Finally, we uncover a hierarchical structure of seizure spread patterns highlighting the relationship between clusters of seizures. Collectively, these findings underscore the broad utility in quantifying seizure activity past seizure onset to identify novel mechanisms of seizure evolution and its relationship to potential seizure freedom.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlatelet alpha-granules contain Von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is stored in eccentric alpha-granule nanodomains, and VWF propeptide (VWFpp). Differential release of VWF and VWFpp has been reported from endothelial cells. It is unclear if this also occurs during platelet alpha-granule exocytosis. We have recently developed a 3D super-resolution imaging workflow for quantification of platelet alpha-granule content based on Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). With this we can study alpha-granule cargo release following platelet activation in hundreds of platelets simultaneously.\n\nAimsTo study release of VWF and VWFpp from alpha-granules using quantitative super-resolution microscopy.\n\nMethodsPlatelets were activated with PAR-1 activating peptide (PAR-1 ap) or collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL). Alpha-tubulin, VWF, VWFpp, SPARC and fibrinogen were imaged using 3D-SIM, followed by semi-automated analysis in FIJI. Uptake of anti-VWF nanobody during degranulation was used to identify alpha-granules that partially released content.\n\nResultsVWF+ and VWFpp+ structures overlapped nearly completely ([~]90%) in resting platelets, implying they are stored in similar eccentric alpha-granule nanodomains. A subset of VWF+/VWFpp+-structures was released completely at 0.6 {micro}M PAR-1 ap, but at higher concentration (20 {micro}M) significantly more VWFpp (85.3{+/-}1.6%) was released than VWF (37.6{+/-}1.4%). Release of other cargo was intermediate at 20 {micro}M (SPARC: 62.2{+/-}1.4%; fibrinogen: 51.9{+/-}2.9%), providing further evidence for differential cargo release. Similar results were obtained using CRP-XL. Anti-VWF nanobody was taken up by VWF+/VWFpp-structures and increased with stimulus strength, demonstrating these were post-exocytotic structures.\n\nConclusionsVWF and VWFpp are differentially released from alpha-granules. This may affect how platelet-derived VWF and VWFpp contribute to formation and stabilization of hemostatic clots.\n\nKey pointsO_LIVWFpp and VWF are localized in the same, eccentric alpha-granule subdomain in resting platelets and do not overlap with other alpha-granule cargo proteins such as fibrinogen\nC_LIO_LIVWFpp and VWF are differentially secreted from individual alpha-granules upon activation with platelet agonists PAR-1 activating peptide and collagen-related peptide\nC_LI",

However, how the proteostasis network orchestrates the folding and assembly of multi-subunit membrane proteins is not well understood. Previous proteomics studies identified Hsp47 (Gene: SERPINH1), a heat shock protein in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, as the most enriched interacting chaperone for gamma-aminobutyric type A (GABAA) receptors. Here, we show that Hsp47 enhances neuronal GABAA receptor functional surface expression, acting after Binding immunoglobulin Protein (BiP) to preferentially bind the folded conformation of GABAA receptors. Therefore, Hsp47 promotes the subunit-subunit interaction, the receptor assembly process, and the anterograde trafficking of GABAA receptors. These Hsp47 properties are also extended to other Cys-loop receptors, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

    "abstract": "Natural climate change and recent anthropogenic activities have largely contributed to habitat loss and fragmentation across the world, leading to 70% of worldwide remaining forests to be within 1 km of forests edges (Haddad et al., 2015). Ecological studies have shown that edge-effect influences ecological communities, species richness and abundance across many taxa, contributing to worldwide decline in biodiversity. Since edge-effect reduces species abundance and connectivity, it is also expected to negatively influence species genetic variation. In fact, previous theoretical studies had showed that populations closer to the edges of a finite stepping-stone model tends to have shorter coalescence times, and therefore, lower genetic diversity, than central populations. However, predicting the impact of edge effect on local genetic diversity remains challenging in realistic and more complex habitat fragments, where the additive effect of multiple edges is expected to take place. In the present study we explore the genetic consequence of habitat loss at the scale of a habitat fragment (patch-scale), looking at the interplay between patch-size and edge-effect on spatial genetic diversity. We propose a statistical approach to estimate  edge-impacted effective population size from habitat cover information and use this measure to predict spatial genetic diversity in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium populations. We address these questions using spatially-explicit simulations and propose a spatially-explicit analytical framework able to model spatio-temporal changes in genetic diversity due to edge-effect and habitat loss.",

    "abstract": "Tandem CAG repeat expansion mutations cause >15 neurodegenerative diseases, where ongoing expansions in patients brains are thought to drive disease onset and progression. Repeat length mutations will involve single-stranded DNAs prone to form mutagenic DNA structures. However, the involvement of single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) in the prevention or formation of repeat instability is poorly understood. Here, we assessed the role of two SSBs, canonical RPA (RPA1-RPA2-RPA3) and the related Alternative-RPA (Alt-RPA, RPA1-RPA4-RPA3), where the primate-specific RPA4 replaces RPA2. RPA is essential for all forms of DNA metabolism, while Alt-RPA has undefined functions. RPA and Alt-RPA are upregulated 2- and 10-fold, respectively, in brains of Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) patients. Correct repair of slipped-CAG DNA structures, intermediates of expansion mutations, is enhanced by RPA, but blocked by Alt-RPA. Slipped-DNAs are bound and melted more efficiently by RPA than by Alt-RPA. Removal of excess slipped-DNAs by FAN1 nuclease is enhanced by RPA, but blocked by Alt-RPA. Protein-protein interactomes (BioID) reveal unique and shared partners of RPA and Alt-RPA, including proteins involved in CAG instability and known modifiers of HD and SCA1 disease. RPA overexpression inhibits rampant CAG expansions in SCA1 mouse brains, coinciding with improved neuron morphology and rescued motor phenotypes. Thus, SSBs are involved in repeat length mutations, where Alt-RPA antagonistically blocks RPA from suppressing CAG expansions and hence pathogenesis. The processing of repeat length mutations is one example by which an Alt-RPA{leftrightarrow}RPA antagonistic interaction can affect outcomes, illuminating questions as to which of the many processes mediated by canonical RPA may also be modulated by Alt-RPA.",

    "abstract": "How individual differences translate into group outcomes is a timely and debated issue. Recent studies, especially in social arthropods and fish, focus on diversity of personality traits. These studies suggest that the phenotypic group assortment by personality type of an animal group, including the presence of \"keystone\" individuals, leads to group-level personality differences and can strongly impact both group and individual outcomes. However, little attention has been given to the variation of a given trait within a group. Theory predicts that phenotypic homogeneity rather than heterogeneity yields the optimal group performance, especially in an anti-predatory context, but the experimental support includes mainly morphological traits, e.g. body size or colouration. Here, we focus on personality and group level differences in a highly gregarious bird, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We investigated how different degrees of within-flock variation in exploration affect flock outcomes in exploratory behaviour and in escape response after a frightening stimulus. First, we established consistent individual differences in exploration. Then, flocks of 4 birds were formed to obtain gradual differences in mean and in variation of exploration scores among flocks. Flocks underwent an exploration test and a perturbation test. More exploratory individuals entered the test arena earlier, tended to start flying more rapidly and also stopped flying sooner upon frightening. Flocks with a more homogeneous distribution with respect to this personality trait were significantly faster to enter the test room, but no effect on the escape response emerged. The mean exploration tendency of the flock or the maximum exploration tendency of purported  key individuals within groups did not play a notable role in explaining such differences in group performance. Our results indicate that it is not the individual that predicts/drives the flock outcome, but rather a group feature, namely phenotypic variation within the group.",

Here we show that isolated intratumoral bacteria with its association with natural purple photosynthetic bacteria have a high innate biocompatibility and drastic immunogenic anticancer efficacies. They preferentially grow and proliferate within targeted tumor milieu, which effectively causes immune cells to infiltrate the tumor and provoke strong anticancer responses in various syngeneic mouse models including those of colorectal cancer, sarcoma, metastatic lung cancer, and extensive drug-resistant breast cancer. Furthermore, these functional bacteria-treated mice, that exhibit excellent anticancerous responses of tumors, have significantly prolonged survival rates with effective immunological memory. Notably, light-harvesting nanocomplexes of microbial consortium of intratumoral bacteria and purple photosynthetic bacteria is capable of tumor diagnosis using bio-optical-window near-infrared light, making them useful theranostic agents for highly targeted immunological elimination of the tumor and for precisely marking tumor location.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of commercial long read sequencing technologies in the 2010s and the concomitant development of new bioinformatics tools bears the potential of de novo genome assemblies of unprecedented contiguity and quality. However, until today these novel technologies suffer from high rates of sequencing errors. These may be overcome by using long and short reads in combination, in so called hybrid approaches, or by increasing the through-put and thereby the coverage of sequencing runs. In particular the latter will thereby increase the cost of the assembly inevitably. Herein, to-date long read and hybrid assemblers were tested on real whole genome sequencing Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies read data sets and sub samples of these in order to elaborate a best practice for de novo assembly. The findings suggest that although long reads alone can be used to reconstruct complete and contiguous genomes, in particular the single-nucleotide and indel error rate remains high compared to hybrid approaches and that this can impact downstream applications such as variation discovery and gene prediction negatively.",

    "abstract": "Advances in multi-omics and big-data technologies have led to numerous prognostic signatures aimed at improving current clinicopathological staging systems. Due to the lack of reproducibility and independent confirmation, few signatures have been translated into clinical routine. As high-quality datasets accumulate, identifying robust signatures across multiple independent cohorts becomes possible. Nonetheless, inaccurate data retrieval, different versions of genome annotations, disparate expression distributions, difficult data cleaning, inconsistent clinical information, algorithm selection, and parameter tuning have impeded model development and validation in multi-center datasets. Hence, for the first time, we introduced SurvivalML (https://rookieutopia.com/app_direct/SurvivalML/), a web application for helping develop and validate prognostic models across multi-center datasets. SurvivalML included 37,325 samples (253 eligible datasets) with both transcriptome data and survival information from 21 cancer types, which were renewedly and uniformly re-annotated, normalized, and cleaned. This application provided 10 survival machine-learning algorithms for flexibly training models via tuning essential parameters online and delivered four aspects for model evaluation, including Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent ROC, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. Overall, we believe that SurvivalML can serve as an attractive platform for model discovery from multi-center datasets.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG expansion of the first exon of the HTT gene, resulting in an extended poly-glutamine (poly-Q) tract in the N-terminus of the protein huntingtin (httex1). The structural changes occurring to the poly-Q when increasing its length remain poorly understood mainly due to its intrinsic flexibility and the strong compositional bias of the protein. The systematic application of site-specific isotopic labeling has enabled residue-specific NMR investigations of the poly-Q tract of pathogenic httex1 variants with 46 and 66 consecutive glutamines. The integrative analysis of the data reveals that the poly-Q tract adopts long -helical conformations stabilized by glutamine side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds. 19F-NMR of site-specifically incorporated fluoro-glutamines and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the mechanism propagating -helical conformations towards the poly-Q from the upstream N17 domain is independent of the poly-Q track length. Aggregation and atomic force microscopy experiments show that the presence of long and persistent -helices in the poly-Q tract is a stronger signature in defining the aggregation kinetics and the structure of the resulting fibrils than the number of glutamines. The ensemble of our observations provides a structural perspective of the pathogenicity of expanded httex1 and paves the way to a deeper understanding of poly-Q related diseases.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly being recognised that changes in the gut microbiome have either a causative or associative relationship with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, most of this research has been carried out in a small number of developed countries with high CRC incidence. It is unknown if lower incidence countries such as India have similar microbial associations.\n\nHaving previously established protocols to facilitate microbiome research in regions with developing research infrastructure, we have now collected and sequenced microbial samples from a larger cohort study of 46 Indian CRC patients and 43 healthy volunteers. When comparing to previous global collections, these samples resemble other Asian samples, with relatively high levels of Prevotella. Predicting cancer status between cohorts shows good concordance. When compared to a previous collection of Indian CRC patients, there was similar concordance, despite different sequencing technologies between cohorts. These results show that there does seem to be a global CRC microbiome, and that some inference between studies is reasonable. However, we also demonstrate that there is definite regional variation, with more similarities between location-matched comparisons. This emphasises the importance of developing protocols and advancing infrastructure to allow as many countries as possible to contribute to microbiome studies of their own populations.\n\nImportanceColorectal cancer is increasing in many countries, thought to be partly due to the interaction between gut bacteria and changing diets. While it is known that populations in different parts of the world have very different gut microbiomes, the study of their role in colorectal cancer is almost exclusively based in the USA and Europe. We have previously shown that there is overlap between the colorectal cancer microbiome in multiple different countries, establishing robust protocols in the process. Here we expand that into a new Indian cohort. We show that while there are similarities between countries, by concentrating on one country, we can uncover important local patterns. This shows the value of sharing expertise and ensuring that work of this nature is possible wherever this disease occurs.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsVineyard performance is impacted by water availability including the amount and seasonality of rainfall and evapotranspiration and irrigation volume. We benchmarked water-limited yield potential (Yw), calculated yield gaps as the difference between Yw and actual yield, and explored the underlying environmental and management causes of these gaps.\n\nMethods and ResultsThe yield and its components in two sections of 24 Shiraz vineyards was monitored during three vintages in the Barossa zone (GI). The frequency distribution of yield was L-shaped, with half the vineyards below 5.2 t ha-1, and an extended tail of the distribution that reached 24.9 t ha-1. The seasonal ratio of actual crop evapotranspiration and reference evapotranspiration was below 0.48 in 85% of cases, with a maximum of 0.65, highlighting a substantial water deficit in these vineyards. A boundary function relating actual yield and seasonal rainfall was fitted to quantify Yw. Yield gaps increased with increasing vine water deficit, quantified by the carbon isotope composition in the fruit. The yield gap was smaller with higher rainfall before budburst, putatively favouring early-season vegetative growth and allocation to reproduction, and with higher rainfall between flowering and veraison, putatively favouring fruit set and berry growth. The gap was larger with higher rainfall and lower radiation between budburst and flowering. The yield gap increased linearly with vine age between 6 and 33 yr at a rate of 0.3 t ha-1 yr-1. The correlation between yield gap and yield components ranked bunch weight {approx} berries per bunch > bunch number > berry weight; the minimum to close the yield gap was 185,000 bunches ha-1, 105 g bunch-1, 108 berries bunch-1 and 1.1 g berry-1.\n\nConclusionsWater deficit and vine age were major causes of yield gaps. Winter irrigation provides an opportunity to improve productivity. The cost of dealing with older, less productive vines needs to be weighed against the rate of increase in yield gap with vine age.\n\nSignificance of the StudyA boundary function to estimate water-limited yield potential returned viticulturally meaningful yield gaps and highlighted potential targets to improve vineyard productivity.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsVine phenology results from the interaction between the genotype, environment and management, with implications for fruit, and wine composition. The impact of weather, site and management practices, underlying elements of terroir, impacting the timing of key phenological stages were explored across the Barossa Zone (GI).\n\nMethods and ResultsVine phenology was assessed in three zones of 24 vineyards over three vintages using the E-L scale before veraison, and total soluble sugars (TSS) in berries during ripening. We explored the associations between weather, plant traits and viticultural variables, and development in four periods: pre-budburst, budburst-flowering, flowering-veraison and veraison-maturity. The spatial structure of the timing of phenological events suggested three main groups of vineyards. This structure followed gradients in topography and soils across the landscape, and were maintained despite the effect of the season (vintage). On average, differences between early and late groups of vineyards were 13 days at budburst, 20 days at flowering and 24 days at TSS = 24 {degrees}Brix. Phenology responded mainly to temperature until flowering, and to temperature and canopy size from flowering to maturity. The strength of the relationship between the duration of the period and temperature ranked pre-budburst (r2 = 0.94) > budburst-flowering (r2 = 0.40) > veraison-maturity (r2 = 0.17). Duration of pre-budburst and budburst-flowering periods was shortened at 6 d {degrees}C-1, compared to 2 d {degrees}C-1 for veraison-maturity. The duration from veraison to maturity increased with yield (r2 = 0.29, Pa < 0.0001).\n\nConclusionsThe spatial variation in development was maintained despite vintage effects and management practices. Variation in temperature due to topography and elevation were the major drivers of vine phenological development until flowering. During ripening, development was driven by temperature and carbon capture and partitioning.\n\nSignificance of the StudyThis is the first attempt to show spatial variability on phenology across the Barossa Valley GI. The observed switch on drivers on phenology during development from temperature-driven processed before flowering to resource-dominated processes during ripening have implications for modelling and vineyard management.",

Schrenkiella parvula is one of the leading extremophyte models with initial molecular genomic resources developed to study its tolerance mechanisms to high salinity. Here we present a transcriptome atlas for S. parvula with subsequent analyses to highlight its diverse gene expression networks associated with salt responses. We included spatiotemporal expression profiles, expression specificity of each gene, and co-expression and functional gene networks representing 115 transcriptomes sequenced from 35 tissue and developmental stages examining their responses before and after 27 salt treatments in our current study. The highest number of tissue-preferentially expressed genes were found in seeds and siliques while genes in seedlings showed the broadest expression profiles among developmental stages. Seedlings had the highest magnitude of overall transcriptomic responses to salinity compared to mature tissues and developmental stages. Differentially expressed genes in response to salt were largely mutually exclusive but shared common stress response pathways spanning across tissues and developmental stages. Our foundational dataset created for S. parvula representing a stress-adapted wild plant lays the groundwork for future functional, comparative, and evolutionary studies using extremophytes aiming to uncover novel stress tolerant mechanisms.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTConcerted transcriptomic responses coordinated across developmental stages and tissues are required to complete a plant lifecycle under salt stress. Transcriptomic resources created with spatiotemporal resolution for plants are rare and for stress-adapted plants rarer. We present a transcriptome atlas enabling discovery of genes and networks evolved as adaptations to salt stress in a model extremophyte, Schrenkiella parvula. The spatiotemporally resolved gene expression networks are largely non-overlapping but functionally connected through synergistic stress responsive pathways.",

Interaction databases may also enable construction of predictive computational models of biological networks, although their fidelity for this purpose is not clear. Here, we benchmark protein interaction databases X2K, Reactome, Pathway Commons, Omnipath, and Signor for their ability to recover manually curated edges from three logic-based network models of cardiac hypertrophy, mechano-signaling, and fibrosis. Pathway Commons performed best at recovering interactions from manually reconstructed hypertrophy (137 of 193 interactions, 71%), mechano-signaling (85 of 125 interactions, 68%), and fibroblast networks (98 of 142 interactions, 69%). While protein interaction databases successfully recovered central, well-conserved pathways, they performed worse at recovering tissue-specific and transcriptional regulation. This highlights a knowledge gap where manual curation is critical. Finally, we tested the ability of Signor and Pathway Commons to identify new edges that improve model predictions, revealing important roles of PKC autophosphorylation and CaMKII phosphorylation of CREB in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

We demonstrate that the \"ratio\"-based omics profiling data, i.e., by scaling the absolute feature values of a study sample relative to those of a concurrently measured universal reference sample, were inherently much more reproducible and comparable across batches, labs, platforms, and omics types, thus empower the horizontal (within-omics) and vertical (cross-omics) data integration in multiomics studies. Our study identifies \"absolute\" feature quantitation as the root cause of irreproducibility in multiomics measurement and data integration, and urges a paradigm shift from \"absolute\" to \"ratio\"-based multiomics profiling with universal reference materials.",

    "abstract": "Motor Imagery is a subject of longstanding scientific interest. However, critical details of motor imagery protocols are not always reported in full, hampering direct replication and translation of this work. The present review provides a quantitative assessment of the prevalence of under-reporting in the recent motor imagery literature. Publications from the years 2018-2020 were examined, with 695 meeting the inclusion criteria for further examination. Of these studies, 64% (445/695) did not provide information about the modality of motor imagery (i.e., kinesthetic, visual, or a mixture of both) used in the study. When visual or mixed imagery was specified, the details of the visual perspective to be used (i.e., first person, third person, or combinations of both) were not reported in 24% (25/103) of studies. Further analysis indicated that studies using questionnaires to assess motor imagery reported more information than those that did not. We conclude that studies using motor imagery consistently under-report key details of their protocols, which poses a significant problem for understanding, replicating, and translating motor imagery effects.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) of the toxic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum are a recurrent problem in many inland and estuarine waters around the world. Strains of P. parvum vary in the toxins they produce and in other physiological traits associated with HABs, but the genetic basis for this variation is unknown. To investigate genome diversity in this morphospecies, we generated genome assemblies for fifteen phylogenetically and geographically diverse strains of P. parvum including Hi-C guided, near-chromosome level assemblies for two strains. Comparative analysis revealed considerable DNA content variation between strains, ranging from 115 Mbp to 845 Mbp. Strains included haploids, diploids, and polyploids, but not all differences in DNA content were due to variation in genome copy number. Haploid genome size between strains of different chemotypes differed by as much as 243 Mbp. Syntenic and phylogenetic analyses indicate that UTEX 2797, a common laboratory strain from Texas, is a hybrid that retains two phylogenetically distinct haplotypes. Investigation of gene families variably present across strains identified several functional categories associated with metabolism, including candidates for the biosynthesis of toxic metabolites, as well as genome size variation, including recent proliferations of transposable elements. Together, our results indicate that P. parvum is comprised of multiple cryptic species. These genomes provide a robust phylogenetic and genomic framework for investigations into the eco-physiological consequences of the intra- and inter-specific genetic variation present in P. parvum and demonstrate the need for similar resources for other HAB-forming morphospecies.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHarmful algal blooms (HABs) are a global concern. Efforts to understand the genetic basis of traits associated with the success of HAB-forming species are limited by a dearth of genomic resources. In this paper we present genomes for fifteen strains of Prymnesium parvum, a toxic alga that causes ecosystem and societally disruptive HABs around the world. We uncover an unprecedented amount of sequence-level, gene family, and genome architecture evolution in P. parvum and provide evidence for both cryptic speciation and hybridization. These results illustrate how both inter- and intraspecific genetic variation can be dramatically underestimated in a protist morphospecies. More work is needed to understand the eco-physiological consequences of hidden genetic diversity in P. parvum and HAB-forming species more generally.",

    "abstract": "Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plays an essential role in meeting the edible oil demand worldwide. Sunflower seed yield can be decomposed into several yield component traits, one of which is the head diameter. In 2019, 2020, and 2022, we evaluated the head diameter phenotypic variation on a set of diverse sunflower accessions (N=342) in replicated field trials. By combining three years of field data, the broad sense heritability (H2) of the head diameter trait was estimated to be 0.88. Then, a subset of N=274 accessions was genotyped by using the tunable genotyping-by-sequencing (tGBS) method, resulting in 226,779 high-quality SNPs. With these SNPs and the head diameter phenotype, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using two statistical approaches: 1) the mixed linear model (MLM) and 2) the fixed and random model circulating probability unification (farmCPU). The MLM and farmCPU GWAS approaches identified 106 and 8 significant SNPs that were placed close to 53 and 21 genes, respectively. Two significant peaks were identified in MLM, with a strong signal on chromosome 10 and a less strong signal on chromosome 16. The farmCPU method detected the same signals on chromosomes 10 and 16 and several additional significant signals on other chromosomes. The head diameter associated genetic loci and the underlying candidate genes can be leveraged for further functional validation and serve as a basis for sunflower oil yield improvement.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections has prompted extensive efforts to exploit new mycobacterial drug targets. ClpC1, the unfoldase component of the essential ClpC1P1P2 protease, has emerged as one particularly promising antibacterial target. However, efforts to identify and characterize ClpC1-targeting compounds are constrained by our limited knowledge of Clp protease function and regulation. To expand our understanding of ClpC1 physiology, we employed a co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry workflow to identify proteins that interact with ClpC1 in Mycolicibacterium smegmatis, a relative of M. tuberculosis. We identify a diverse panel of interaction partners, many of which make co-immunoprecipitate with both the regulatory N-terminal domain and the ATPase core of ClpC1. Notably, our interactome analysis identifies MSMEI_3879, a truncated gene product unique to M. smegmatis, as a novel proteolytic substrate. Degradation of MSMEI_3879 by ClpC1P1P2 in vitro requires an exposed N-terminal sequence, reinforcing the idea that ClpC1 selectively recognizes disordered motifs. Fluorescent substrates incorporating MSMEI_3879 may be useful in screening for novel ClpC1-targeting antibiotics, to help address the challenge of M. tuberculosis drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Dynein and kinesin motors mediate long-range intracellular transport, translocating towards microtubule minus and plus ends, respectively. Cargoes often undergo bidirectional transport by binding to both motors simultaneously. However, it is not known how motor activities are coordinated in such circumstances. In Drosophila, sequential activities of the dynein-dynactin-BicD-Egalitarian (DDBE) complex and of kinesin-1 deliver oskar mRNA from nurse cells to the oocyte, and within the oocyte to the posterior pole. Here, through in vitro reconstitution, we show that Tm1-I/C, a Tropomyosin-1 isoform, links kinesin-1 in an inactive state to DDBE-associated oskar mRNA. NMR spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and structural modeling indicate that Tm1-I/C suppresses kinesin-1 activity by stabilizing its autoinhibited conformation, thus preventing a tug-of-war between the opposite polarity motors until kinesin-1 is activated in the oocyte. Our work reveals a novel strategy ensuring sequential activity of microtubule motors.",

    "abstract": "Background14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitous proteins that play a role in cardiac physiology (e.g., metabolism, development, and cell cycle). Furthermore, 14-3-3 proteins were proposed to regulate the electrical function of the heart by interacting with several cardiac ion channels, including the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5. Given the many cardiac arrhythmias associated with Nav1.5 dysfunction, understanding its regulation by the protein partners is crucial.\n\nAimsIn this study, we aimed to investigate the role of 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of the human cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5.\n\nMethods and ResultsAmongst the seven 14-3-3 isoforms, only 14-3-3{eta} (encoded by YWHAH gene) weakly co-immunoprecipitated with Nav1.5 when heterologously co-expressed in tsA201 cells. Total and cell surface expression of Nav1.5 was however not modified by 14-3-3{eta} overexpression or inhibition with difopein, and 14-3-3{eta} did not affect physical interaction between Nav1.5 - subunits. The current-voltage relationship and the amplitude of Nav1.5-mediated sodium peak current density were also not changed.\n\nConclusionsOur findings illustrate that the direct implication of 14-3-3 proteins in regulating Nav1.5 is not evident in a transformed human kidney cell line tsA201.\n\nSummaryThis work shows that only 14-3-3{eta}, exhibits weak/transient interaction with Nav1.5, and does not modify its total protein expression, plasmalemmal trafficking, and basal biophysical properties of the whole-cell current. Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous 14-3-3/ligand interactions with difopein does not affect the dimerization of Nav1.5. Therefore, 14-3-3 proteins are suggested to be dispensable for the Nav1.5 regulation in a heterologous expression system.",

Natural Killer (NK) cells may provide an optimal class of immune cells for CAR-based approaches due to their inherent anti-tumor functionality. We sought to tune CAR synapses in NK cells by adding an intracellular scaffolding protein binding site to the CAR. We employed a PDZ binding motif (PDZbm) that specifically binds Scribble4 resulting in additional scaffolding crosslinking to enhance synapse formation and cell polarization5,6. Combined effects of this novel CAR design resulted in increased effector cell functionality in vitro and in vivo. Synapse-tuned CAR-NK cells exhibited amplified synaptic strength, number and abundance of secreted cytokines, enhanced killing of tumor cells, and prolonged survival with tumor clearance in two solid tumor models. Thus, synapse tuning has the potential to improve the efficacy of CAR-based cell therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive hematological malignancy, and there has not been any significant improvement in therapy of AML over the past several decades. The mRNA vaccines have become a promising strategy against multiple cancers, however, its application on AML remains undefined. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antigens for developing mRNA vaccines against AML and explore the immune landscape of AML to select appropriate patients for vaccination.\n\nMethodsThe genomic data and clinical information were retrieved from TCGA and GEO, respectively. The gene mutation data of AML were obtained from cBioPortal. GEPIA2 was used to analyze differentially expressed genes. The single cell RNA-seq database Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) was used to explore the association between the potential tumor antigens and the infiltrating immune cells in the bone marrow. Consensus clustering analysis was applied to identify distinct immune subtypes. The correlation between the abundance of antigen presenting cells and the expression level of antigens was evaluated using Spearman correlation analysis. The characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment in each subtype were investigated based on single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify co-expression modules and screen the hub genes.\n\nResultsFive potential tumor antigens were identified for mRNA vaccine from the pool of overexpressed and mutated genes, including CDH23, LRP1, MEFV, MYOF and SLC9A9, which were associated with infiltration of antigen-presenting immune cells (APCs). AML patients were stratified into two immune subtypes Cluster1 (C1) and Cluster2 (C2), which were characterized by distinct molecular and clinical features. Patients with C1 subtype showed higher expression level of the five candidate genes and worse prognosis compared with C2 subtype. Moreover, C1 subtype demonstrated an immune-hot and immunosuppressive phenotype, while the C1 subtype had an immune-cold phenotype. Furthermore, the two immune subtype showed remarkably different expression of immune checkpoints, immunogenic cell death modulators and human leukocyte antigens. Finally, WCGNA identified a module and five hub genes that can be used for predicting the response of AML patients to mRNA vaccine.\n\nConclusionCDH23, LRP1, MEFV, MYOF and SLC9A9 were potential antigens for developing AML mRNA vaccine, and AML patients in immune subtype 1 were suitable for vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Wild bacteria, from the open ocean to the gut, experience persistent nutrient limitation. This fundamentally affects bacterial physiology and metabolism and has profound impacts on their infection by bacterial viruses (bacteriophages). For virulent bacteriophages, which cannot enter a lysogenic state, this poses a problem for environmental persistence. Here we demonstrate that virulent bacteriophage SPP1 productively infects nutrient-limited stationary phase cultures of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Slow production and release of low numbers of infective viral particles resulted from a prolonged infection of the host population. Extensive culture lysis was greatly delayed, releasing additional viral particles and promoting fresh infections of bacterial survivors. Induced overproduction of cell surface bacteriophage receptor YueB, compensating for its scarcity in stationary phase, expedited infection dynamics under nutrient-limiting conditions, but did not change overall infection productivity. The temporal program of SPP1 gene expression differed from exponential phase, consistent with a prolonged, persistent mode of infection. Reduced expression of genes coding viral structural proteins correlated with the low yield of infectious particles. Importantly, exogenous influx of the carbon source maltose enhanced viral particle production. Our results uncover a novel adaptive strategy of a lytic phage for productive infection of nutrient-limited bacterial populations through persistent, exhaustive infection.",

Previously, the motifs were explained by an overlap of the non-palindromic motif being present on one of the half-site of targeted sequences. Here, we applied multicomponent mixture models to integration site sequences of diverse retroviruses. We demonstrate that the weak palindromic motifs result from a combination of independent sub-motifs restricted to only a few positions proximal to the site of integration. The sub-motifs are formed by either palindrome-forming nucleotide preference or nucleotide exclusion. Using the mixture models, we also identified HIV-1-favored palindromic sequences in Alu repeats serving as hotspots for integration.

    "abstract": "The Coxiellaceae family is composed of five genera showing lifestyles ranging from free-living to symbiosis. Among them, Coxiella burnetii is a well-known pathogen causing Q fever in humans. This bacterium presents both intracellular (parasitic) and environmental (resistant) forms. Recently, several environmental Coxiella genomes have been reported, among which several have come from intracellular mutualistic symbionts of ticks, termed Coxiella-like endosymbionts. We sequenced two new Coxiella-LE genomes from Dermacentor marginatus (CLEDm) and Ornithodoros maritimus (CLEOmar) ticks, the latter belonging to the C. burnetii lineage. Using these newly sequenced Coxiella-LEs and 43 Coxiellaceae genomes, we conducted comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses to increase our knowledge of C. burnetii pathogenicity and the emergence of Coxiella-LEs. Results highlight the probably parasitic nature of the common ancestor of the Coxiellaceae. Indeed, the virulence factor Dot/Icm T4 Secretion System is present in most, but not all, Coxiellaceae. Whereas it is part of a putative pathogenic island in C. burnetii, it has been entirely lost or inactivated in Coxiella-LEs, suggesting its importance in pathogenesis. Additionally, we found that a Sha/Mrp antiporter was laterally acquired in the C. burnetii lineage. This antiporter might be involved in alkali resistance and the development of the resistant form that is able to persist in the environment for long periods of time. The Sha operon is eroded or absent in Coxiella-LEs. Finally, we found that all Coxiella representatives produce B vitamins and co-factors indicating a pre-adaptation of Coxiella to mutualism with hematophagous arthropods. Accordingly, the ancestor of C. burnetii and Coxiella-LEs was likely a parasitic bacterium able to manipulate its host cell and to produce vitamins and co-factors for its own use.",

    "abstract": "\"Biological noise\" is defined as functionally insignificant events that occur in living cells due to imperfect fidelity of biological processes. Distinguishing between biological function and biological noise is often difficult, and experiments to measure biological noise have not been performed. Here, we measure biological noise in yeast cells by analyzing chromatin structure and transcription of an 18 kb region of DNA whose sequence was randomly generated and hence lacks biological function. Nucleosome occupancy on random-sequence DNA is comparable to that on yeast genomic DNA. However, nucleosome-depleted regions are much less frequent, and there are fewer well-positioned nucleosomes and shorter nucleosome arrays. Steady-state levels of RNAs expressed from random-sequence DNA are comparable to those of typical yeast mRNAs, although transcription and mRNA decay rates are higher. Transcriptional initiation (5 ends) from random-sequence DNA occurs at numerous sites at low levels, indicating very low intrinsic specificity of the Pol II machinery. In contrast, poly(A) profiles (relative levels and clustering of 3 isoforms) of random-sequence RNAs are roughly comparable to those within 3 untranslated regions of yeast mRNAs, suggesting limited evolutionary constraints on poly(A) site choice. RNAs expressed from random-sequence DNA show higher cell-to-cell variability than RNAs expressed from yeast genomic DNA, suggesting that functional elements limit the variability among individual cells within a population. These observations indicate that transcriptional noise occurs at high levels in yeast, and they provide insight into how chromatin and transcription patterns arise from the evolved yeast genome.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly prevalent in the aging population, yet currently no disease-modifying treatments are available. Increasing the expression of the cold-shock protein, RBM3, through therapeutic hypothermia is remarkably neuroprotective, but cooling poses a health risk itself, strongly limiting its clinical application. Selective upregulation of RBM3 at normothermia thus holds immense therapeutic potential. Here we identify a poison exon within the RBM3 gene that is solely responsible for cold-induced RBM3 expression. Genetic removal or ASO-mediated manipulation of this exon yields high RBM3 levels independent of cooling. Notably, a single administration of ASO to exclude the poison exon, using FDA-approved chemistry, results in long-lasting increase of RBM3 expression in mouse brains. In prion-diseased mice, this treatment leads to remarkable neuroprotection, with prevention of neuronal loss and spongiosis despite high levels of prion protein. RBM3-inducing ASOs could thus broadly deliver protection in humans in conditions ranging from acute brain injury to Alzheimers disease.\n\nOne sentence summaryInducing cold shock protein RBM3 by modulating its alternative splicing at normothermia is neuroprotective in vivo",

    "abstract": "Uveal melanoma (UM) originating in the eye and metastasizing to the liver is associated with poor prognosis and has only one approved therapeutic option. We hypothesized that liver-borne growth factors may contribute to UM growth. Therefore, we investigated the role of insulin-like growth factor -1 and its receptor (IGF-1/IGF-1R) signaling in UM. We found that the insulin receptor substrate -1 (IRS-1) is overexpressed in UM cells and tumors. Since we previously observed that IGF-1R antibody therapy was not clinically effective in UM, we investigated the potential of NT157, a small molecule inhibitor of IRS-1/2 in blocking this pathway in UM. NT157 treatment in UM cells resulted in reduced cell survival and migration, and increased apoptosis. This treatment also significantly inhibited UM tumor growth in vivo, in the chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and subcutaneous mouse models, validating the in vitro effect. Mechanistically, through reverse phase protein array (RPPA), we identified significant proteomic changes in the PI3K/AKT pathway, a downstream mediator of IGF-1 signaling, with NT157 treatment. Together, these results suggest that NT157 inhibits cell survival, migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo via inhibiting IGF-1 signaling in UM.",

    "abstract": "Deleterious mutations in the X-linked gene encoding ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) cause the most common urea cycle disorder, OTC deficiency. This rare, but highly actionable disease can present with severe neonatal onset in males or with later onset in either sex. Neonatal onset patients appear normal at birth but rapidly develop hyperammonemia, which can progress to cerebral edema, coma and death, outcomes ameliorated by rapid diagnosis and treatment. Existing biochemical assays have limitations, including the sensitivity of the citrulline assays used in newborn screening panels. With prior knowledge of variant pathogenicity, DNA sequence-based diagnostics would provide an alternative screening method. Here, we develop a high throughput functional assay for human OTC and measure the impact of 1,570 variants, 84% of all SNP-accessible missense mutations. Our assay scores agree well with existing clinical significance calls, distinguishing known benign from pathogenic variants and variants with neonatal onset from late-onset disease presentation. Further, use of an intronless expression construct allows us to measure the impact of amino acid changes at splice sites independent of their effect on splicing, thereby separating the contribution of splicing and protein coding changes to aid the analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity. Finally, we assess the utility of our functional data on OTC variant curation by using the current ACMG/AMP guidelines to reclassify variants. Inclusion of our data as PS3/BS3 substantially improves variant interpretation. Thus, our dataset is of high clinical utility and illustrates the power of functional assays to inform interpretation of existing and novel genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Sexually dimorphic traits in morphologies are widely studied, but those in essential molecular pathways remain largely unexplored. Previous work showed substantial sex differences in Drosophila gonadal piRNAs, which guide PIWI proteins to silence selfish genetic elements thereby safeguarding fertility. However, the genetic control mechanisms of piRNA sexual dimorphism remain unknown. Here, we showed that most sex differences in the piRNA program originate from the germline rather than gonadal somatic cells. Building on this, we dissected the contribution of sex chromosome and cellular sexual identity towards the sex-specific germline piRNA program. We found that the presence of the Y chromosome is sufficient to recapitulate some aspects of the male piRNA program in a female cellular environment. Meanwhile, sexual identity controls the sexually divergent piRNA production from X-linked and autosomal loci, revealing a crucial input from sex determination into piRNA biogenesis. Sexual identity regulates piRNA biogenesis through Sxl and this effect is mediated in part through chromatin proteins Phf7 and Kipferl. Together, our work delineated the genetic control of a sex-specific piRNA program, where sex chromosome and sexual identity collectively sculpt an essential molecular trait.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) lung infections are the leading cause of mortality among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients; therefore, the eradication of new-onset Pa lung infections is an important therapeutic goal that can have long-term health benefits. The use of early antibiotic eradication therapy (AET) has been shown to eradicate the majority of new-onset Pa infections, and it is hoped that identifying the underlying basis for AET failure will further improve treatment outcomes. Here we generated random forest machine learning models to predict AET outcomes based on pathogen genomic data. We used a nested cross validation design, population structure control, and recursive feature selection to improve model performance and showed that incorporating population structure control was crucial for improving model interpretation and generalizability. Our best model, controlling for population structure and using only 30 recursively selected features, had an area under the curve of 0.87 for a holdout test dataset. The top-ranked features were generally associated with motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCystic fibrosis (CF) patients are susceptible to lung infections by the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) leading to increased morbidity and earlier mortality. Consequently, doctors use antibiotic eradication therapy (AET) to clear these new-onset Pa infections, which is successful in 60%-90% of cases. The hope is that by identifying the factors that lead to AET failure, we will improve treatment outcomes and improve the lives of CF patients. In this study, we attempted to predict AET success or failure based on the genomic sequences of the infecting Pa strains. We used machine learning models to determine the role of Pa genetics and to identify genes associated with AET failure. We found that our best model could predict treatment outcome with an accuracy of 0.87, and that genes associated with chronic infection (e.g., bacterial motility, biofilm formation, antimicrobial resistance) were also associated with AET failure.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-{kappa}B) is an essential and evolutionarily conserved transcription factor complex primarily involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Transposable elements (TEs) can be co-opted to innovate immune transcriptional regulatory networks; however, the extent to which TEs have contributed to the modulation of NF-{kappa}B response in different mammalian lineages is not well established. Here we performed a multi-species analysis of TEs bound by the NF-{kappa}B subunit RELA (p65) in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha). Using endothelial cell RELA ChIP-seq data from human, mouse and cow, we found that 55 TE subfamilies were enriched within NF-{kappa}B bound regions. These RELA-bound transposons possess multiple active epigenetic features and reside near TNF-induced genes. A prominent example of lineage-specific contribution of transposons comes from the bovine SINE subfamilies Bov-tA1/2/3 which collectively contributed over 14,000 NF-{kappa}B bound regions in cow. By comparing NF-{kappa}B binding data across species, we found several examples of NF-{kappa}B motif-bearing TEs that appeared to colonize the genome prior to the divergence of the selected mammals, including a DNA transposon MER81, whose ancestral sequence contains two intact RELA motifs. We demonstrate that one NF-{kappa}B bound MER81 element can control the TNF-induced expression of INFGR2 (Interferon Gamma Receptor 2) in human. Lastly, the presence of RELA motifs within MER81 elements appeared to stabilize during human evolution, indicative of purifying selection acting on a subset of these NF-{kappa}B bound ancient DNA transposons. Taken together, our results implicate multiple transposons in establishing NF-{kappa}B mediated regulatory networks during mammalian evolution.",

However, a lack of gene editing tools and transgenic strains has limited the ability to link genotype to phenotype and dissect molecular mechanisms. To facilitate genetic manipulation and the creation of reporter lines, we developed a protocol for highly efficient, transgenerational, CRISPR-mediated gene editing in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus manjavacas by microinjection of Cas9 protein and synthetic single guide RNA into the vitellaria of young amictic (asexual) females. To demonstrate the efficacy of the method, we created knockout mutants of the developmental gene vasa and the DNA mismatch repair gene mlh3. More than half of mothers survived injection and produced offspring. Genotyping these offspring and successive generations revealed that most carried at least one CRISPR-induced mutation, with many apparently mutated at both alleles or mosaic. In addition, we achieved precise CRISPR-mediated knockin of a stop codon cassette in the mlh3 locus, with half of injected mothers producing 33% or more F2 offspring with an insertion of the cassette. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in rotifers to provide insight into the function of specific genes and further advance rotifers as a model system for biological discovery.",

    "abstract": "Developments in fluorescence microscopy techniques have enabled imaging of individual fluorescently labelled proteins in biological systems, and in the current study, a single-molecule microscopy (SMM) technique has been applied in vivo, using the zebrafish embryo model. We have used multifocal two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy (2PEFM) to study the dynamics of a GFP-fused H-Ras membrane-anchoring domain, GFP-C10H-Ras, in the epidermal cells of living embryos. In previous studies, a fast and a slow diffusing population of GFP-C10H-Ras molecules had been found. The application of the multifocal 2PEFM technique enabled us to focus on the slow diffusing population, which appears to occur in clusters that diffuse within microdomains of the epidermal cell membranes. Based on their mobility on a short timescale ([&le;] 1s) we could distinguish between a subpopulation that was diffusing and one that was virtually immobile. Owing to the multifocal 2PEFM imaging mode, we were able to dramatically reduce photobleaching which enabled us to follow the GFP-C10H-Ras particles over a prolonged time (> 3 s) and reconstruct their molecular trajectories of the diffusing subpopulation. These trajectories exhibited that the C10H-Ras particles continuously switch between a diffusing state and brief bursts of increased diffusion. As a result, they display an anomalous mobility pattern that can be referred to as hop diffusion. Taken together, this study demonstrates that multifocal 2PEFM offers a powerful approach to studying individual particles for prolonged periods of time, and that using this approach we were able to uncover the hopping behavior of GFP-C10H-Ras.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTBy application of the two-photon excitation single-molecule microscopy to living zebrafish embryos, anomalous diffusion modes of individual H-Ras membrane anchors in epidermal cells were found.",

    "abstract": "Actin plays a vital role in maintaining the stability and rigidity of biological cells while allowing for cell motility and shape change. The semiflexible nature of actin filaments - along with the myriad actin-binding proteins (ABPs) that serve to crosslink, bundle, and stabilize filaments - are central to this multifunctionality. The effect of ABPs on the structural and mechanical properties of actin network mechanics has been the topic of fervent investigation over the past few decades, revealing diverse structures from isotropic percolated networks to heterogeneous bundles that depend on the crosslinker type and concentration. Yet, the impact of filament stabilization and stiffening via ABPs on the nonlinear response of crosslinked networks has yet to be explored. Here, we perform optical tweezers microheology measurements to characterize the nonlinear force response and relaxation dynamics of actin networks in the presence of varying concentrations of -actinin, which transiently crosslinks actin filaments, and phalloidin, which stabilizes filamentous actin and increases its persistence length. We show that crosslinking and stabilization can act both synergistically and antagonistically to tune the network resistance to nonlinear straining. For example, phalloidin-stabilization leads to enhanced elastic response and reduced dissipation at large strains and timescales, while the initial microscale force response is reduced compared to networks without phalloidin. Moreover, we find that stabilization switches this initial response from that of stress-stiffening to softening despite the increased filament stiffness that phalloidin confers. Finally, we show that both crosslinking and stabilization are necessary to elicit these emergent features, while the effect of stabilization on networks without crosslinkers is much more subdued. We suggest that these intriguing mechanical properties arise from the competition and cooperation between filament connectivity, bundling, and rigidification, shedding light on how ABPs with distinct roles can act in concert to mediate diverse mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton and bio-inspired polymeric materials.",

    "abstract": "Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is the primary pathway of vertebrate DNA double-strand-break repair. NHEJ polymerases and nucleases can modify DNA ends to render them compatible for ligation, but these enzymes are usually deployed only when necessary for repair of damaged DNA ends, thereby minimizing mutagenesis. Using frog egg extracts, we reveal a structural role for the NHEJ-specific DNA Ligase IV (Lig4) in promoting NHEJ fidelity. Mutational analysis demonstrates that Lig4 must bind DNA ends to form the short-range synaptic complex, in which DNA ends are closely aligned prior to ligation. Furthermore, single-molecule experiments show that a single Lig4 binds both DNA ends at the instant of short-range synapsis. In this way, compatible ends can be rapidly ligated without polymerase or nuclease activity, which we previously showed is restricted to the short-range synaptic complex. Our results provide a molecular basis for the fidelity of NHEJ.",

    "abstract": "Considering dynamical aspects of protein-drug binding processes is inevitable in current drug compound design. Conformational plasticity of protein kinases poses a challenge for the design of their inhibitors, and therefore, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have often been utilized. While protein conformational changes have been increasingly discussed, a fundamental yet non-trivial question remains for the effect of drug compound flexibility, which is hardly detectable from experiments. In this study, we apply two-dimensional replica-exchange MD simulations as enhanced sampling to investigate how c-Src kinase can bind PP1, a small inhibitor, and dasatinib, a larger inhibitor with greater flexibility. 600 microseconds simulations in total sample binding and unbinding events of these inhibitors much more frequently than conventional MD simulation, resulting in statistically converged binding pathways. While the two inhibitors adopt a similar mechanism of multiple binding pathways, the non-canonical binding poses become less feasible for dasatinib. A notable difference is apparent in their energetics where dasatinib stabilizes at intermediate states more than PP1 to raise the barrier toward the canonical pose. Conformational analysis shows that dasatinib adopts linear and bent forms for which relative populations are altered upon binding. We further find hidden conformations of dasatinib at intermediate regions, and unexpectedly one of them could efficiently bypasses the intermediate-to-bound state transition. The results demonstrate that inhibitor size and flexibility impact the binding mechanism, which could potentially modulate inhibitor residence time.",

    "abstract": "Factors governing the faithful replication of chromosomes are essential for cellular and genomic integrity. While a variety of mechanisms to manage breaks and promote repair of DNA are widely recognized, epigenetic landmarks that preserve telomere-to-telomere replication fidelity and prevent genome instability are not well-understood. SETD2 is the histone methyltransferase responsible for trimethylation on histone H3 lysine 36 and is newly recognized as a tumor suppressor that acts to maintain genome stability. Importantly, SETD2 is frequently lost in cancers that exhibit extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. Here, we demonstrate that loss of SETD2 and H3K36me3 promotes chromosome segregation errors and DNA bridging during mitosis, and that these bridges are driven by the formation of dicentric chromosomes. Cytogenetic analyses revealed that these chromosomes were comprised of mirror-imaged isochromosomes and isodicentric chromosomes that contain two active centromeres. These data demonstrate that the SETD2 histone methyltransferase is essential to prevent a palindromic replication intermediate, whose loss precipitates the formation of a mutable chromatin structure known to initiate a cascade of genomic instability in cancer.",

    "abstract": "The chemokine CXCL4 activates myeloid cells and contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. One mechanism of CXCL4 action is binding of nucleic acids to promote their internalization and activation of endosomal TLRs. However, the signaling pathways and receptors that mediate myeloid cell responses to CXCL4 alone are not well characterized. Here, we report that in primary human monocytes, CXCL4 activated NF-{kappa}B and a TBK1-JNK signaling axis that drive the expression of inflammatory, fibrotic and neutrophil chemokine genes, and also RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. Surprisingly, six distinct lines of evidence targeting TLR4 expression and function suggested a role for TLR4 in CXCL4 responses. However, in contrast to the canonical TLR4 agonist LPS, CXCL4 did not effectively activate an autocrine IFN response or IL-12 family genes, even after IFN-{gamma} priming of monocytes. In accord with its role in inducing chemokine and inflammatory gene expression, CXCL4 regulated neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into skin wounds, and promoted wound healing in a mouse model. Our findings suggest that CXCL4 modulates the profile of TLR4 responses to induce a macrophage phenotype divergent from LPS-activated cells, provide new insights into mechanisms by which CXCL4 activates human monocytes, and implicate CXCL4 in regulation of skin wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Clubroot caused by the soil-borne protist pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae is one of the most devastating diseases of Brassica oil and vegetable crops worldwide. Understanding the pathogen infection strategy is crucial for the development of disease control. However, the molecular mechanism by which this pathogen promotes infection remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a P. brassicae-secreted effector PbE3-2 that impedes plant immunity by ubiquitinating the immune regulator RD21A for degradation. Overexpression of PbE3-2 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in higher susceptibility to P. brassicae and decreases in chitin-triggered reactive oxygen species burst and expression of marker genes in salicylic acid signaling. PbE3-2 interacted with and ubiquitinated RD21A in vitro and in vivo. Mutant plants deficient in RD21A exhibited similar susceptibility and compromsied immune responses as in PbE3-2 overexpression plants. These results suggest that P. brassicae promotes clubroot disease through RD21A degradation mediated by the effector PbE3-2. As PbE3-2 is widely conserved across different P. brassicae pathotypes, the degradation of RD21A by PbE3-2 might be a prevalent infection strategy in this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Cable bacteria of the Desulfobulbaceae family are centimeter-long filamentous bacteria, which are capable of conducting long-distance electron transfer. Currently, all cable bacteria are classified into two candidate genera: Candidatus Electronema, typically found in freshwater environments, and Candidatus Electrothrix, typically found in saltwater environments. This taxonomic framework is based on both 16S rRNA gene sequences and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) phylogenies. However, most of the currently available MAGs are highly fragmented, incomplete, and thus likely miss key genes essential for deciphering the physiology of cable bacteria. To address this, we performed Nanopore long read (total 162.4 Gbp) and Illumina short read (total 148.3 Gbp) shotgun sequencing of selected environmental samples and a single-strain enrichment of Ca. Electronema aureum. We recovered multiple cable bacteria MAGs, including two circular and one single-contig. Phylogenomic analysis, also confirmed by 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny, classified one circular MAG and the single-contig MAG as novel species of cable bacteria, which we propose to name Ca. Electronema halotolerans and Ca. Electrothrix laxa, respectively. The Ca. Electronema halotolerans, despite belonging to the previously recognized freshwater genus of cable bacteria, was retrieved from brackish-water sediment. Metabolic predictions showed several adaptations to a high salinity environment, similar to the \"saltwater\" Ca. Electrothrix species, indicating how Ca. Electronema halotolerans may be the evolutionary link between marine and freshwater cable bacteria lineages.",

    "abstract": "Seed plants comprise angiosperms and gymnosperms. The latter includes gnetophytes, cycads, Ginkgo, and conifers. Conifers are distributed worldwide, with 630 species distributed across eight families and 70 genera. Their distinctiveness has triggered much debate on their origin, evolution, and phylogenetic placement among seed plants. To better understand the evolution of gymnosperms and their relation to other seed plants, we report here a high-quality genome sequence for a tree species, Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), which has excellent timber quality and high aluminum adaptability and is a member of Cupressaceae with high levels of heterozygosity. We assembled an 11.24 Gb genome with a contig N50 value of 2.15 Mb and anchored the 10.89 Gb sequence to 11 chromosomes. Phylogenomic analyses showed that cycads sister to Ginkgo, which place to sister in all gymnosperm lineages, and Gnetales within conifers sister to Pinaceae. Whole-genome duplication (WGD) analysis showed that the ancestor of seed plants has differentiated into angiosperms and gymnosperms after having experienced a WGD event. The ancestor of extant gymnosperm has experienced a gymnosperm-specific WGD event and the extant angiosperms do not share a common WGD before their most recent common ancestor diverged into existing angiosperms lineages. Analysis of the MADS-box gene family of C. lanceolata revealed the developmental mechanism of the reproductive organs in C. lanceolata, which supported the (A)B(C) model of the development of gymnosperms reproductive organs. In addition, astringent seeds and shedding of whole branches (with withered leaves) might be a strategy of C. lanceolata that evolved during long-term adaptation to an aluminum-rich environment. The findings also reveal the molecular regulation mechanism of shade tolerance in C. lanceolata seedlings. Our results improve the resolution of ancestral genomic features within seed plants and the knowledge of genome evolution and diversification of gymnosperms.",
