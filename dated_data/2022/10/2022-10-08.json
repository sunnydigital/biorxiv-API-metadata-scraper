    "abstract": "Xylella fastidiosa is a bacterium that infects crops like grapevines, coffee, almonds, citrus and olives, causing economically devastating damage. There is, however, little understanding of the genes that contribute to resistance, the genomic architecture of resistance, and the potential role of climate in shaping resistance, in part because major crops like grapevines (V. vinifera) are not resistant to the bacterium. Here we studied a wild grapevine species, Vitis arizonica, that segregates for resistance to X. fastidiosa. Using genome-wide association, we identified candidate genes that mediate the host response to X. fastidiosa infection. We uncovered evidence that resistance requires genes from multiple genomic regions, based on data from breeding populations and from additional Vitis species. We also inferred that resistance evolved more than once in the wild, suggesting that wild Vitis species may be a rich source for resistance alleles and mechanisms. Finally, resistance in V. arizonica was climate dependent, because individuals from low (< 10{degrees}C) temperature locations in the wettest quarter were typically susceptible to infection, likely reflecting a lack of pathogen pressure in these climates. Surprisingly, climate was nearly as effective a predictor of resistance phenotypes as some genetic markers. This work underscores that pathogen pressure is likely to increase with climate, but it also provides genetic insight and tools for breeding and transforming resistant crops.",

    "abstract": "Double-digest Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) is widely used to generate genomic data for non-model organisms in evolutionary and ecological studies. Along with affordable paired-end sequencing, this method makes population genomic analyses more accessible. However, multiple factors should be considered when designing a ddRADseq experiment, which can be challenging for new users. The generated data often suffer from substantial read overlaps and adaptor contamination, severely reducing sequencing efficiency and at times affecting data quality. Here, we analyse diverse datasets from the literature and carry out controlled experiments to understand the effects of enzyme choice and size selection on sequencing efficiency. The empirical data reveal that size selection is imprecise and has limited efficacy. In certain scenarios, a substantial proportion of short fragments pass below the lower size-selection cut-off resulting in low sequencing efficiency. However, enzyme choice can considerably mitigate inadvertent inclusion of these shorter fragments. A simple model based on these experiments is implemented to predict the number of genomic fragments generated after digestion and size selection, number of SNPs genotyped, number of samples that can be multiplexed, and the expected sequencing efficiency. We developed ddgRADer - http://ddgrader.haifa.ac.il/ - a user-friendly webtool that aids ddRADseq experimental design while optimising sequencing efficiency. This tool can also be used for single enzyme protocols such as Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS). Given user-defined study goals, ddgRADer recommends enzyme pairs and allows users to compare and choose enzymes and size-selection criteria. ddgRADer improves the accessibility and ease of designing ddRADseq experiments and increases the probability of success of the first population genomic study conducted in labs with no prior experience in genomics.",

    "abstract": "Microgels have recently received widespread attention for their applications in a wide array of domains such as tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and cell and tissue transplantation because of their properties like injectability, modularity, porosity, and the ability to be customized in terms of size, form, and mechanical properties. However, it is still challenging to mass produce microgels with diverse sizes and tunable properties. Herein, we developed an air-assisted co-axial device (ACAD) for continuous production of microgels in a high-throughput manner. To test its robustness, microgels of multiple hydrogels and their combination, including alginate (Alg), gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and Alg-GelMA, were formed at a maximum production rate of 65,000 microgels per sec while retaining circularity and a size range of 50-500 m based on varying air pressure levels. The ACAD platform allowed single and multiple cell encapsulation with around 75% efficiency. These microgels illustrated appealing rheological properties such as yield stress, viscosity, and shear modulus for bioprinting applications. Specifically, Alg microgels have the potential to be used as a sacrificial support bath while GelMA microgels have potential for direct extrusion both on their own or when loaded in a bulk GelMA hydrogel. Generated microgels showed high cell viability (>90%) and proliferation over 7 days with their increased interactions with cells, particularly for GelMA microgels. The developed strategy provides a facile and rapid approach without any complex or expensive consumables and accessories for scalable high-throughput microgel production for cell therapy, tissue regeneration and 3D bioprinting applications.",

    "abstract": "Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is a substrate adaptor in the ubiquitin proteasome system, and plays important roles in cell-cycle control, development, and cancer. SPOP forms linear higher-order oligomers following an isodesmic self-association model. Oligomerization is essential for SPOPs multivalent interactions with substrates, which facilitate phase separation and localization to biomolecular condensates. Structural characterization of SPOP in its oligomeric state and in solution is, however, challenging due to the inherent conformational and compositional heterogeneity of the oligomeric species. Here, we develop an approach to simultaneously and self-consistently characterize the conformational ensemble and the distribution of oligomeric states of SPOP by combining small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and molecular dynamics simulations. We build initial conformational ensembles of SPOP oligomers using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and use a Bayesian/maximum entropy approach to refine the ensembles, along with the distribution of oligomeric states, against a concentration series of SAXS experiments. Our results suggest that SPOP oligomers behave as rigid, helical structures in solution, and that a flexible linker region allows SPOPs substrate binding domains to extend away from the core of the oligomers. Additionally, our results are in good agreement with previous characterization of the isodesmic self-association of SPOP. In the future, the approach presented here can be extended to other systems to simultaneously characterize structural heterogeneity and self-assembly.",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming metabolism is of great therapeutic interest for reducing morbidity and mortality during sepsis-induced critical illness1. Disappointing results from randomized controlled trials targeting glutamine and antioxidant metabolism in patients with sepsis have begged for both identification of new metabolic targets, and a deeper understanding of the metabolic fate of glutamine at the systemic and tissue-specific manner2-4. In critically ill patients versus elective surgical controls, skeletal muscle transcriptional metabolic reprogramming is comprised of reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, electron transport, and glutamate transport, with concomitant increases in glutathione cycling, glutamine, branched chain, and aromatic amino acid transport. To analyze putative interorgan communications during sepsis, we performed systemic and tissue specific metabolic phenotyping in a murine polymicrobial sepsis model, cecal ligation and puncture. In the setting of drastically elevated inflammatory cytokines, we observed >10% body weight loss, >50% reductions in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, and near full suppression of voluntary activity for the 48 hours following sepsis as compared to sham-operated controls. We found increased correlations in the metabolome between liver, kidney, and spleen, with drastic loss of correlations between the heart and quadriceps metabolome and all other organs, pointing to a shared metabolic signature within vital abdominal organs, and unique metabolic signatures for skeletal and cardiac muscle during sepsis. A lowered GSH:GSSG and elevated AMP:ATP ratio in the liver underlie the significant upregulation of isotopically labeled glutamines contribution to TCA anaplerosis and glutamine-derived glutathione biosynthesis; meanwhile, the skeletal muscle and spleen were the only organs where glutamines contribution to the TCA cycle was significantly suppressed. These results highlight tissue-specific mitochondrial reprogramming, rather than global mitochondrial dysfunction, as a mechanistic consequence of sepsis. Using a multi-omic approach, we demonstrate a model by which sepsis-induced proteolysis fuels the livers production of anaplerotic substrates and the antioxidant glutathione to sustain tolerance to sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer treatment is shifting away from traditional to precise therapeutic approaches informed by patient and tumor profiles. To achieve better outcomes for cancer patients, it will be necessary to design and test therapies that target the heterogeneity of tumors that exists within and between patients and even within the same tumor. Existing in vitro model systems do not fully recapitulate the physio-chemical gradients of tumors and may fall short of representing a living organism. Mouse models remain the gold standard for preclinical testing but lack the throughput needed to quickly understand mechanisms and iterate quickly to maximize therapeutic efficacy. Microfluidic systems can fill this gap but remain out of reach for most biologic laboratories due to their complexity in assembly and use. We created T-SLICE (Tumor Spheroids Layered in an Imageable Cancer Environment) to enable high-throughput imageable studies within a complex simulated tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor spheroids are seeded on a monolayer of fibroblasts and cultured between two parallel, closely spaced glass coverslips (300-700 m). The restrictive gap distance limits permeation of nutrients and oxygen to create gradients that recapitulate those observed in the in vivo TME. In T-SLICE, physio-chemical gradients are defined by cellular metabolism, akin to an actual tumor. We demonstrate that this is associated with changes in cellular viability, mitochondrial trans-membrane potential, and proliferation. T-SLICE provides a live-cell imaging compatible, high throughput platform that allows real-time monitoring of cellular phenotypes, function, and sociology within a cell-driven TME physio-chemistry amenable to therapeutic optimization, screening, and patient avatar modelling.",
