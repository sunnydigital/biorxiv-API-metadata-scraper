    "abstract": "Evolutionary early-branching xanthomonads, also referred to as clade-1 xanthomonads, include major plant pathogens, most of which colonize monocotyledonous plants. Seven species have been validly described, among them the two sugarcane pathogens Xanthomonas albilineans and Xanthomonas sacchari, and Xanthomonas translucens, which infects small grain cereals, diverse grasses, but also asparagus and pistachio trees. Single-gene sequencing and genomic approaches indicated that this clade likely contains more, yet undescribed species. In this study, we sequenced representative strains of three novel species using long-read sequencing technology. Xanthomonas sp. pv. phormiicola strain CFBP 8444 causes bacterial streak on New Zealand flax, another monocotyledonous plant. Xanthomonas sp. strain CFBP 8443 has been isolated from common bean and Xanthomonas sp. strain CFBP 8445 originated from banana. Complete assemblies of the chromosomes confirmed their unique taxonomic position within clade 1 of Xanthomonas. Genome mining revealed novel genetic traits, hitherto undescribed in other members of the Xanthomonas genus. In strain CFBP 8444, we identified genes related to the synthesis of coronatine-like compounds, a phytotoxin produced by several pseudomonads, which raises interesting questions about the evolution and pathogenicity of this pathogen. In addition, strain CFBP 8444 was found to encode a second, atypical flagellar gene cluster in addition to the canonical flagellar gene cluster. Overall, this research represents an important step toward better understanding the evolutionary history and biology of early-branching xanthomonads.",

    "abstract": "Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus (IAV) is involved in multiple blocking processes of cellular antiviral action. One of these includes the binding of cytosolic tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) to impede nuclear translocation and, thus, counteracting the block of viral RNA elongation taking place inside the nucleus. In addition, TRIM25 is part of the RIG-I signaling pathway and is an important component regarding the activation of interferon-induced genes and triggering cellular antiviral responses. In this study, we focus on the spatial localization of TRIM25 with respect to cytosolic NS1 aggregates found in IAV infected cells. Besides strain specific characteristics, we confirmed co-localization of TRIM25 to NS1 cytosolic aggregates at 16 hours post infection for all investigated IAV strains based on image analysis on single cell level. Immunoprecipitation further confirmed the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 when comparing wt IAV and recombinant IAV devoid of NS1 expression. Of note, we combined fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting viral RNA with immunolabeling of TRIM25 suitable for nanoscopy and the diffraction limited detection of NS1 in one imaging approach. Our study reveals strain dependent differences in the block of IRF3 activation in respect to the accumulation of TRIM25 in cytosolic NS1 aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Translation initiation in bacteria is thought to occur upon base-pairing between the Shine-Dalgarno site in the mRNA and anti-Shine-Dalgarno site in the rRNA. However, in many bacterial species, such as Caulobacter crescentus, a minority of mRNAs have Shine-Dalgarno sites. To examine the functional importance of Shine-Dalgarno sites in C. crescentus, we analyzed the transcriptome and found more Shine-Dalgarno sites exist in the coding sequence than preceding start codons. To examine the function of Shine-Dalgarno sites in initiation we designed a series of mutants with altered ribosome accessibility and Shine-Dalgarno content in translation initiation regions (TIRs) and elongator AUG regions (EARs). A lack of mRNA structure content is required for initiation in TIRs, and when introduced into EARs, can stimulate initiation, suggesting that low mRNA structure content is a major feature required for initiation. SD sites appear to stimulate initiation in TIRs, which generally lack structure content, but SD sites only stimulate initiation in EARs if RNA secondary structures are destabilized. Taken together, this suggests that the difference in secondary structure between TIRs and EARs directs ribosomes to start codons where SD base pairing can tune the efficiency of initiation, but SDs in EARs do not stimulate initiation as they are blocked by stable secondary structures. This highlights the importance of studying translation initiation mechanisms in diverse bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "Several species of luminous bacteria in the genus Photobacterium are the light organ symbionts of teleost fishes. Photobacterium leiognathi and its subspecies, P. mandapamensis, in particular, commonly form bioluminescent symbioses with fish hosts in the Leiognathidae and Acropomatidae families as well as with cardinalfish in the genus Siphamia (Apogonidae). These two closely related lineages of Photobacterium are right at the cutoff average nucleotide identity used to delimit bacterial species (95-96%) and show overlapping ecological niches, including their host fish range. However, there are only a few whole genome assemblies available for these bacterial species, particularly for symbiotic strains isolated from fish light organs, that can be used to explore genome evolution of these two lineages. Here we used Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing to produce long reads for assembling highly contiguous genomes of Photobacterium strains isolated from fish light organs, including several P. kishitanii strains isolated from deep water fishes. We were able to assemble 31 high-quality genomes with near complete BUSCO scores, many at the chromosome-level, and compare their gene contents, including plasmid genes. In doing so, we discovered a new candidate species of Photobacterium, Candidatus Photobacterium acropomis, which originated from the light organ of the acropomid fish, Acropoma japonicum. We also describe a lack of congruency between the presence of the luxF gene, which is involved in light production, and the phylogenetic relationships between closely related P. leiognathi and P. mandapamensis strains. In contrast, there was strong congruency between luxF and the host fish family of origin, suggesting this gene might be essential to initiate bioluminescent symbioses with certain hosts, including Siphamia and Acropoma species. Our study shows the benefit of using long reads in the assembly of bacterial genomes and outlines an assembly pipeline that results in highly contiguous genomes, even from low-coverage ONT reads.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-hour cycles that allow organisms to anticipate predictable environmental changes such as light intensity, temperature, and humidity. Circadian rhythms are found widely throughout nature where cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms known to carry out circadian rhythmicity. Circadian rhythmicity in cyanobacteria is carried out via the KaiA, KaiB and KaiC core oscillator proteins that keep ~24h time. A series of input and output proteins; CikA, SasA and RpaA, regulate the clock by sensing environmental changes, and time rhythmic activities, including global rhythms of gene expression. Our previous work identified a novel set of KaiC-interacting proteins, some of which are encoded by genes that are essential for viability. To understand the relationship of these essential genes to the clock we applied CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) which utilizes a deactivated Cas9 protein and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to reduce the expression of target genes but not fully abolish their expression to allow for survival. Eight candidate genes were targeted, and strains were analyzed by quantitative Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR for reduction of gene expression and rhythms of gene expression were monitored to analyze circadian phenotypes. We present data that reduced expression of SynPCC942_0001, which encodes for the {beta}-clamp of the replicative DNA polymerase, or SynPCC7942_1081, which likely encodes for KtrA involved in K+ transport, displayed a long circadian period compared to the wild type. As neither of these proteins have been previously implicated in the circadian clock, these data suggest that diverse cellular processes, DNA replication and K+ transport, can influence the circadian clock and represent new avenues to understand clock function.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesCOVID-19 disease can be exacerbated by Aspergillus superinfection (CAPA). The causes of CAPA are not yet fully understood. Recently, alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with a complicating course and increasing severity of COVID-19 disease, most likely via immunological mechanisms. Aim of this study was to investigate a potential association between severe CAPA and alterations in the gut and bronchial microbiota.\n\nMethodsWe performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of stool and bronchial samples from a total of 16 COVID-19 patients with CAPA and 26 patients without CAPA. All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. Results were carefully tested for potential influences on the microbiome during hospitalization.\n\nResultsWe found that late in COVID-19 disease, CAPA patients exhibited a trend towards reduced gut microbial diversity. Furthermore, late stage CAPA disease showed an increased presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the gut. This is not found in late non-CAPA cases or early disease. The analysis of bronchial samples did not show significant results.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first study showing alterations in the gut microbiome accompany severe CAPA and possibly influence the hosts immunological response. In particular, an increase of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the intestine could be of importance.\n\nSummaryThe composition of intestinal bacteria in severe CAPA disease is altered with an increase in Staphylococcus epidermidis in the gut. Alterations in the composition of intestinal bacteria in severe CAPA may indicate immunologic involvement of the gut in the disease.",

    "abstract": "A healthy mammary gland is a necessity for milk production of dairy goats. The role of chi-miR-3880 in goat lactation is illustrated in our previous study. Among the differentially expressed genes regulated by chi-miR-3880, one seventh are interferon stimulated genes, including MX1, MX2, IFIT3, IFI44L, and DDX58. As the inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) has been identified as a potential marker of caseous lymphadenitis in lactating sheep, the interaction between IFN{gamma} and immune-related microRNAs is explored. In this study, it was found that chi-miR-3880 could be one of the microRNAs downregulated by IFN{gamma} in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). The regulation among IFN{gamma}, chi-miR-3880, and DDX58, as well as their roles in mammary gland were investigated. The study illustrated that IFN{gamma}/chi-miR-3880/DDX58 axis modulates GMEC proliferation and lipid formation through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and regulates apoptosis through Caspase-3 and Bcl-2/Bax. The role of the axis in involution was reflected by the expression of p53 and NF-{kappa}B. In conclusion, IFN{gamma}/chi-miR-3880/DDX58 axis plays an important part in lactation.",

    "abstract": "In Dictyostelium chimeras, strains social behaviour is defined based on their relative representation in the spores - the reproductive cells resulting from development - referred to as spore bias. Some strains, called  cheaters, display systematically positive spore bias in chimeras and are considered a threat to the evolutionary stability of multicellular organization. The selective advantage gained by cheaters is indeed predicted to undermine collective functions whenever social behaviours are genetically determined. However, genotypes are not the only determinant of spore bias, and the relative role of genetic and plastic phenotypic differences in strains evolutionary success is unclear.\n\nHere, we control phenotypic heterogeneity by harvesting cells in different growth phases, and study the effects of plastic variation on spore bias in chimeras composed of isogenic or genetically different populations. Spore bias is shown to depend both on growth phase and on population composition, and to be negatively correlated to the fraction of  loners, i.e. cells that do not join aggregates. We examined several single-cell mechanical properties that are expected to affect aggregation efficiency, and found that variations in the fraction of slowly moving cells with growth phase may explain why earlier cultures appear to be underrepresented in the spores. The involvement of a go-or-grow mechanism during cell aggregation is also consistent with known variations of cell-cycle phase distribution during population growth. We confirm the expected ubiquity of growth-phase induced spore bias variation by showing that it is not negligible in genetic chimeras, and can even reverse the classification of a strains social behaviour. These results suggest that aggregation can provide an efficient  lottery system to harness the evolutionary spread of cheaters.",

Despite their biological significance, our understanding of how these iron-chelating cyclic hexapeptides are assembled by non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines remains poorly understood, primarily due to the nonlinearity exhibited by the domain architecture. Herein, we report the biochemical characterization of the SidC NRPS, responsible for construction of the intracellular siderophore ferricrocin. In vitro reconstitution of purified SidC revealed its ability to produce ferricrocin and its structural variant, ferrichrome. Application of intact protein mass spectrometry uncovered several non-canonical events during peptidyl siderophore biosynthesis, including inter-modular loading of amino acid substrates and an adenylation domain capable of poly-amide bond formation.

    "abstract": "Infection with HIV is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which may be mediated by the effect of the viral proteins, Nef and Tat, on inflammation and endothelial activation. The viral genes coding for Nef and Tat contain numerous polymorphisms, which we hypothesised may be differentially associated with endothelial activation. Therefore, our aim was to assess the association of these polymorphisms with endothelial activation and inflammation in subjects infected with HIV-1.\n\nThe HIV-1 nef and tat genes were sequenced from clinical isolates from 31 and 34 patients, respectively. Plasma concentration of biomarkers of endothelial activation (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (E-selectin), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and von Willebrand factor (vWF)), and biomarkers of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8)), were measured. Analysis of HIV-1 nef gene sequences identified five polymorphisms (V16I, H40Y, T50A,H, S169N and H188Q,S) that were each significantly (p<0.05) associated with ICAM-1 plasma concentration. An additive effect of these variants on plasma ICAM-1 concentration (p=0.004 for trend), was observed. No significant associations were seen between Tat amino acid residues and plasma concentration of markers of endothelial activation and inflammation. These are the first human in vivo data that support the hypothesis that nef gene polymorphisms impact endothelial function.\n\nImportanceCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality in adults living with HIV, which may in part be due to endothelial activation and inflammation caused by the viral proteins, Nef and Tat. However, there is no data from humans supporting the CVD-associated Nef and Tat hypothesis, and assays for accurately measuring Nef and Tat plasma concentrations are not currently available. Therefore, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in the nef and tat genes of clinical viral isolates may be associated with host plasma markers of endothelial activation and inflammation. Our results show that this was the case, with five nef polymorphisms showing both individual and additive association with plasma concentration of ICAM-1. The HIV-1 Tat gene, however, showed no significant association with plasma concentrations of markers of endothelial activation and inflammation. This is the first human study to directly link Nef to endothelial activation and to provide a possible screening tool i.e., nef genotyping, for identifying individuals at high risk of endothelial-based diseases.",

Most of the proteins that are required to carry out these functions are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. A growing number of metabolic disorders arising from mitochondrial dysfunction can be traced to errors in mitochondrial protein import. The mechanisms underlying the import of precursor proteins are commonly studied by using radioactively-labeled precursor proteins, which are imported into purified mitochondria. Here, we establish a fluorescence-based import assay to analyze protein import into mitochondria. We show that fluorescently-labeled precursors enable import analysis with similar sensitivity to those using radioactive precursors, yet they provide the advantage of quantifying import with picomole resolution. We adapted the import assay to a 96-well plate format allowing for fast analysis in a screening-compatible format. Moreover, we show that fluorescently labeled precursors can be used to monitor the assembly of the F1F0 ATP-synthase in purified mitochondria.

Here we show that ICL-1, the only protein of the glyoxylate shunt, is critical for protection against embryonic lethality resulting from elevated levels of mitochondrial superoxide. In exploring the mechanism by which ICL-1 protects against ROS-mediated embryonic lethality, we find that ICL-1 is required for the efficient activation of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and that the UPRmt is essential to suppress embryonic/neonatal lethality in animals lacking mitochondrial SOD. In sum, we identified a biochemical pathway that highlights a molecular strategy for combating superoxide consequences in cells.",

    "abstract": "Diverse aerobic bacteria use atmospheric H2 as an energy source for growth and survival. This recently discovered yet globally significant process regulates the composition of the atmosphere, enhances soil biodiversity, and drives primary production in certain extreme environments. Atmospheric H2 oxidation has been attributed to still uncharacterised members of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase superfamily. However, it is unresolved how these enzymes overcome the extraordinary catalytic challenge of selectively oxidizing picomolar levels of H2 amid ambient levels of the catalytic poison O2, and how the derived electrons are transferred to the respiratory chain. Here we determined the 1.52 [A] resolution CryoEM structure of the mycobacterial hydrogenase Huc and investigated its mechanism by integrating kinetics, electrochemistry, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics simulations. Purified Huc is an oxygen-insensitive enzyme that couples the oxidation of atmospheric H2 at its large subunit to the hydrogenation of the respiratory electron carrier menaquinone at its small subunit. The enzyme uses a narrow hydrophobic gas channel to selectively bind atmospheric H2 at the expense of O2, while three [3Fe-4S] clusters and their unusual ligation by a D-histidine modulate the electrochemical properties of the enzyme such that atmospheric H2 oxidation is energetically feasible. Huc forms an 833 kDa complex composed of an octamer of catalytic subunits around a membrane-associated central stalk, which extracts and transports menaquinone a remarkable 94 [A] from the membrane, enabling its reduction. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the biogeochemically and ecologically critical process of atmospheric H2 oxidation. Through the first characterisation of a group 2 [NiFe]-hydrogenase, we also uncover a novel mode of energy coupling dependent on long-range quinone transport and pave way for the development of biocatalysts that oxidize H2 in ambient air.",

The 3D structure of these two enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana have not been solved yet.\n\nMethodsThrough template-based homology modeling by different software like Robetta and Alphafold, the three-dimensional structure of enzymes of Arabidopsis thaliana has been predicted.

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe classification of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) into distinct molecular subtypes defined by ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 or YAP1 expression, paves the way for the development of targeted therapeutics. However, the existence of a distinct YAP1-expressing SCLC subtype remains controversial. Here we have undertaken a detailed molecular and histological characterisation of YAP1 expressing SCLC-Y to understand the biology of this proposed subtype.\n\nMethodsThe mutational landscape of human SCLC cell lines was interrogated to identify pathogenic genomic alterations unique to SCLC-Y. Xenograft tumours generated from cell lines representing the molecular subtypes of SCLC (SCLC-A, -N, -P and -Y) were evaluated by a panel of pathologists. Diagnoses were validated by transcriptomic analysis of primary tumour and human cell line datasets.\n\nResultsUnexpectedly, pathogenic mutations in SMARCA4 were identified in six of eight SCLC-Y cell lines and correlated with reduced SMARCA4 mRNA and protein expression. Pathologist evaluations revealed that SMARCA4-deficient SCLC-Y tumours exhibited features consistent with thoracic SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumours (SMARCA4-UT). Similarly, the transcriptional profile SMARCA4-mutant SCLC-Y lines more closely resembled primary SMARCA4-UT, or SMARCA4-deficient non-small cell carcinoma, than SCLC. Combining clinical, pathological, transcriptomic, and genetic data we found little evidence to support a diagnosis of SCLC for any of the YAP1-expressing cell lines originally used to define the SCLC-Y subtype.\n\nConclusionsSCLC-Y cell lines harbour inactivating SMARCA4 mutations and exhibit characteristics consistent with SMARCA4-deficient malignancies rather than SCLC. Our findings suggest that, unlike ASCL1, NEUROD1 and POU2F3, YAP1 is not a subtype defining transcription factor in SCLC.",

Mutations in PARK15/FBXO7 cause autosomal recessive PD and FBXO7 has been shown to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis. We investigated the extent to which FBXO7 and its Drosophila orthologue, ntc, share functional homology and explored its role in mitophagy in vivo. We show that ntc mutants partially phenocopy Pink1 and parkin mutants and ntc overexpression supresses parkin phenotypes. Furthermore, ntc can modulate basal mitophagy in a Pink1- and parkin-independent manner by promoting the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins, a mechanism that is opposed by the deubiquitinase USP30. This basal ubiquitination serves as the substrate for Pink1-mediated phosphorylation which triggers stress-induced mitophagy. We propose that FBXO7/ntc works in equilibrium with USP30 to provide a checkpoint for mitochondrial quality control in basal conditions in vivo and presents a new avenue for therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is a new pharmacology based on small-molecule degraders that induce proximity between a protein of interest (POI) and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Of the approximately 600 E3s encoded in the human genome, only around two percent can be co-opted with degraders. This underrepresentation is caused by a paucity of discovery approaches to identify degraders for defined E3s. This hampers a rational expansion of the druggable proteome, and stymies critical advancements in the field, such as tissue- and cell-specific degradation. Here, we focus on dynamic NEDD8 conjugation, a posttranslational, regulatory circuit that controls the activity of 250 cullin RING E3 ligases (CRLs). Leveraging this regulatory layer enabled us to develop a scalable assay to identify compounds that alter the interactome of an E3 of interest by tracing their abundance after pharmacologically induced auto-degradation. Initial validation studies are performed for CRBN and VHL, but proteomics studies indicate broad applicability for many CRLs. Among amenable ligases, we select CRLDCAF15 for a proof-of-concept screen, leading to the identification of a novel DCAF15-dependent molecular glue degrader inducing the degradation of RBM23 and RBM39. Together, this strategy empowers the scalable identification of degraders specific to a ligase of interest.",

    "abstract": "The functional maturation of neurons is a prolonged process that extends well beyond mitotic exit and is mediated by the chromatin-dependent orchestration of gene transcription programs. We find that the postnatal maturation of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) requires dynamic changes in the genomic distribution of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), demonstrating a function for this chromatin modification beyond its role in cell fate specification. The developmental loss of H3K27me3 at promoters of genes that turn on as CGNs mature is facilitated by the lysine demethylase, and ASD-risk gene, Kdm6b. Interestingly, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 in newborn CGNs not only blocks the repression of progenitor genes but also impairs the induction of mature CGN genes, showing the importance of bidirectional H3K27me3 regulation across the genome. These data demonstrate that H3K27me3 turnover in developing postmitotic neurons regulates the temporal coordination of gene expression programs that underlie functional neuronal maturation.",

    "abstract": "Estrogens are steroid hormones produced by the aromatization of androgens by the aromatase enzyme, encoded by the CYP19A1 gene. Although generally referred to as \"female sex hormones\", estrogen is also produced in the adult testes of many mammals, including humans. To better understand the function of estrogens in the male, we used the rabbit model which is an important biomedical model. First, the expression of CYP19A1 was localized, demonstrating that testicular estrogens are produced by meiotic germ cells inside the seminiferous tubules. Next, the cells expressing ESR1 and ESR2 were identified, showing that estrogens could exert their function on post-meiotic germ cells in the tubules and play a role during sperm maturation, since ESR1 and ESR2 were detected in the cauda epididymis. Then, CRISPR/Cas9 CYP19A1-/- genetically modified rabbits were analyzed. CYP19A1-/- males showed decreased fertility with lower sperm count associated with hypo-spermatogenesis and lower spermatid number. Germ/sperm cell DNA methylation was unchanged, while sperm parameters were affected as CYP19A1-/- males exhibited reduced sperm motility associated with increased flagellar defects. In conclusion, testicular estrogens could be involved in the spermatocyte-spermatid transition in the testis, and in the acquisition of sperm motility in the epididymis.",

Here, we report the discovery of a -proteobacterial heat shock protein, LarA, that functions as a dedicated Lon regulator. We show that LarA accumulates at the onset of proteotoxic stress and allosterically activates Lon-catalysed degradation of a large group of substrates through a five amino acid sequence at its C-terminus. Further, we find that LarA is regulated by Lon itself, which is critical to prevent toxic overactivation of Lon. We suggest that the temporal LarA-dependent activation of Lon helps to meet an increased proteolysis demand at the onset of protein unfolding stress. Our study defines a regulatory interaction of a conserved protease with a heat shock protein, serving as a paradigm of how protease activity can be tuned under changing environmental conditions.",

Protein interaction studies reveal that TMED7 interacts with TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 but not with TLR3 and TLR9. On the other hand, TMED2 interacts with TLR2, TLR4 and TLR3. Dominant negative forms of TMED7 suppress the export of cell surface TLRs from the ER to the Golgi. By contrast TMED2 is required for the ER-export of both plasma membrane and endosomal TLRs. We also find that a specific N-linked glycan of TLR2 is required for anterograde trafficking and may be directly recognised by TMEDs. Together, these findings suggest that association of TMED2 and TMED7 with TLRs facilitates anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi.",

    "abstract": "Signaling via IL1{beta} and TLR4 receptors (IL1R-TLR4) plays a crucial role in cytokine and fatty acid-induced beta cell inflammation, in type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively. IL1R-TLR4 share signaling mechanisms via a common, cytoplasmic, toll-like-receptor domain to activate proinflammatory JNK and IKK kinases. We have previously reported that in response to IL1{beta}, pancreatic islets isolated from TRB3 knockout (TRB3KO) mice show attenuated kinetics of activation for MAP3K MLK3, and JNK stress kinases. Here we report that similar to MLK3 and JNK, TRB3KO islets also show a decrease in amplitude and duration of IL1{beta}/LPS-stimulated TAK1 and IKK phosphorylation. Thus, loss of TRB3 attenuates both pathways critically required for a full-blown, cytokine-inducible, proapoptotic response in beta cells. TRB3KO islets display a sharp decrease in cytokine-induced beta cell death, accompanied by a decrease in select downstream NFkB targets, most notably, inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS/NOS2), a well-characterized mediator of beta cell dysfunction and death. In order to better understand the molecular basis of TRB3-enhanced IL1R-TLR4 signaling, we interrogated the TRB3 interactome and identified Flightless-homolog 1 (Fli1), an immunomodulatory, actin-binding, leucine-rich-repeat protein, as a novel TRB3-interaction factor. TRB3 binds and disrupts Fli1-dependent sequestration of MyD88, thereby increasing availability of this proximal adaptor to participate in IL1R-TLR4 signaling. Fli1 forms a multiprotein complex that can disconnect IL1R-TLR4 from MyD88, resulting in a brake on assembly of downstream signaling complexes. By interacting with Fli1, TRB3 lifts the brake on IL1R-TLR4 signaling to augment the proinflammatory response in beta cells.",

Here, we present four structural snapshots of activated {beta}arrs, in complex with distinct phosphorylation patterns derived from the carboxyl-terminus of three different GPCRs, determined using cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These structures of activated {beta}arrs elucidate a \"lock-and-key\" type conserved mechanism of {beta}arr activation wherein a P-X-P-P phosphorylation pattern in GPCRs interacts with a spatially organized K-K-R-R-K-K sequence in the N-domain of {beta}arrs. Interestingly, the P-X-P-P pattern simultaneously engages multiple structural elements in {beta}arrs responsible for maintaining the basal conformation, and thereby, leads to efficient {beta}arr activation. The conserved nature of this lock-and-key mechanism is further illustrated by a comprehensive sequence analysis of the human GPCRome, and demonstrated in cellular context with targeted mutagenesis including \"loss-of-function\" and \"gain-of-function\" experiments with respect to {beta}arr activation measured by an intrabody-based conformational sensor. Taken together, our findings uncover previously lacking structural insights, which explain the ability of distinct GPCRs to activate {beta}arrs through a common mechanism, and a key missing link in the conceptual framework of GPCR-{beta}arr interaction and resulting functional outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of RNA viruses encode the information required for replication in host cells in both their linear sequence and in complex higher-order structures. A subset of these complex functional RNA genome structures show clear sequence conservation. However, the extent to which viral RNA genomes contain conserved structural elements - that cannot be detected by sequence alone - that nonetheless are critical to viral fitness is largely unknown. Here, we take a structure-first approach to identify motifs conserved across the coding sequences of the RNA genomes for the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. We used SHAPE-MaP to identify 22 candidate motifs with conserved RNA structures, but no prior association with viral replication. At least ten of these motifs are important for viral fitness, revealing a significant unnoticed extent of RNA structure-mediated regulation within viral coding sequences. These conserved viral RNA structures promote a compact global genome architecture, interact with proteins, and regulate the viral replication cycle. These motifs are constrained at the levels of both RNA structure and protein sequence and are potential resistance-refractory targets for antivirals and live-attenuated vaccines. Structure-first identification of conserved RNA structure is poised to guide efficient discovery of RNA-mediated regulation in viral genomes and other cellular RNAs.",
