    "abstract": "Sleep has been shown to boost the integration of memories, and thus to facilitate relational learning. This benefit is thought to rely upon memory reactivation during non-REM sleep. We set out to test this possibility by explicitly cueing such reactivation using a technique called targeted memory reactivation (TMR), in which sounds are paired with learned material in wake and then softly played back to the participant in sleep, triggering reactivation of the associated memories. Specifically, we tested whether TMR during slow wave sleep leads to enhancements in inferential thinking in a transitive inference task. Because the Up-phase of the slow oscillation is more responsive to external cues than the Down-phase, we also asked whether stimulation at this specific phase is more beneficial for such integration. Our data show that Up-phase TMR boosts the ability to make inferences, but only for the most distant inferential leaps. Such stimulation was also associated with detectable memory reinstatement, whereas Down-phase stimulation produced no such trace and led to below-chance performance. These findings demonstrate that cueing memory reactivation at the right time points in sleep can provide a direct benefit to difficult relational learning problems.\n\nSignificance StatementMemory reactivation in sleep is thought to be important for integrative thinking. We examined this by explicitly cueing reactivation of a transitive inference task during slow wave sleep using Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR). Because TMR at different phases of the slow oscillation has different impacts, we cued different hierarchies at Up and Down phases. Up-phase TMR enhanced inferential performance and was associated with classifiable memory reactivation. Conversely, Down-phase TMR lead to a short-term impairment in inferential thinking and no detectable reactivation. These findings provide the first evidence that TMR can boost transitive inference and is thus important for integration and reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Maps of the nervous system that identify individual cells along with their type, subcellular components, and connectivity have the potential to reveal fundamental organizational principles of neural circuits. Volumetric nanometer-resolution imaging of brain tissue provides the raw data needed to build such maps, but inferring all the relevant cellular and subcellular annotation layers is challenging. Here, we present Segmentation-Guided Contrastive Learning of Representations (\"SegCLR\"), a self-supervised machine learning technique that produces highly informative representations of cells directly from 3d electron microscope imagery and segmentations. When applied to volumes of human and mouse cerebral cortex, SegCLR enabled the classification of cellular subcompartments (axon, dendrite, soma, astrocytic process) with 4,000-fold less labeled data compared to fully supervised approaches. Surprisingly, SegCLR also enabled inference of cell types (neurons, glia, and subtypes of each) from fragments with lengths as small as 10 micrometers, a task that can be difficult for humans to perform and whose feasibility greatly enhances the utility of imaging portions of brains in which many neuron fragments terminate at a volume boundary. These predictions were further augmented via Gaussian process uncertainty estimation to enable analyses restricted to high confidence subsets of the data. Finally, SegCLR enabled detailed exploration of layer-5 pyramidal cell subtypes and automated large-scale statistical analysis of upstream and downstream synaptic partners in mouse visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial volume (ICV) is frequently used in volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, both as an adjustment factor for head size and as a variable of interest. Associations with age have been reported in both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, but results have varied, potentially due to differences in ICV estimation methods. Here, we compared five commonly used ICV estimation methods and their cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with age. T1-weighted cross-sectional MRI data was included for 651 healthy individuals recruited through the NORMENT Centre (mean age = 46.1 years, range = 12.0-85.8 years) and 2,410 healthy individuals recruited through the UK Biobank study (UKB, mean age = 63.2 years, range = 47.0-80.3 years), where follow-up data was also available with a mean follow-up interval of 2.3 years. ICV was estimated with FreeSurfer (eTIV and sbTIV), SPM12, CAT12, and FSL. We assessed Pearson correlations, performed Bland-Altman analysis, and tested the explained variance of sex, height, body weight, and age on pairwise differences between ICV estimation methods. We fitted regression models to test linear and non-linear cross-sectional associations between age and ICV. For the UKB dataset, we further assessed longitudinal ICV change using linear mixed-effects (LME) models. We found overall high correlations across ICV estimation method, with the lowest correlations between FSL and eTIV (r=0.87) and between FSL and CAT12 (r=0.89). Widespread proportional bias was found in the Bland-Altman analyses, i.e., agreement between methods varying as a function of head size. Body weight, age, and sex explained the most variance in the differences between ICV estimation methods, indicating possible confounding by these variables for some estimation methods. In the NORMENT dataset, cross-sectional associations with age were found only for FSL and SPM12, indicating a positive association. For the UKB dataset, we observed negative cross-sectional associations with age for all ICV estimation methods. Longitudinal associations with age were found for all ICV estimation methods, with estimated annual percentage change ranging from -0.291 % to -0.416 % across the sampled age range. This convergence of longitudinal results across ICV estimation methods, in the largest dataset to date, offers strong evidence for age-related ICV reductions in mid- to late adulthood.\n\nHighlightsO_LICorrelations between the five assessed estimation methods were very high (r>0.90) with the exception of FSL and eTIV (r=0.87), and FSL and CAT12 (r=0.89).\nC_LIO_LIExplained variance of estimated ICV differences by body weight, age, and sex indicate possible confounding for some ICV estimation methods.\nC_LIO_LIPositive cross-sectional associations with age, from adolescence to old age, were observed for the SPM12 and FSL estimation methods in one dataset.\nC_LIO_LIIn the other dataset, negative cross-sectional associations with age, from mid- to late adulthood, were found for all estimation methods.\nC_LIO_LILongitudinal ICV changes were observed for all estimation methods, indicating an annual percentage ICV reduction of -0.29 % to -0.42 % in mid- to late adulthood.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Historically, staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) was a preeminent reef-builder in the Caribbean and Tropical Western Atlantic, where it constructed extensive thickets at 5-20 m depth that supported diverse ecosystems and provided coastal populations with food, storm protection, and income from tourism. In recent decades, A. cervicornis declined precipitously, up to 97% in some localities. To reverse its decline, widespread efforts are underway to characterize the phenotypic and genetic diversity of persisting populations with the goal of restoring them to historical levels by out-planting nursery grown specimens. To support this target, we developed transcriptomes for two A. cervicornis populations located in Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, Belize. These populations experience significantly different temperatures, light levels and water currents, and they harbor individuals that differ in key phenotypes. Because differentiating the gene activity of diverse taxa--i.e., coral host, algal photosymbiont, plus associated eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and viruses-- is critical to understanding the function of the coral holobiont, we developed a pipeline for parsing transcripts by taxon. Separate transcriptomes for each population contain complete representatives for >96% of 978 conserved metazoan single copy orthologs. The taxonomic breakdown of transcripts differed between sites, with more bacterial transcripts recovered from Calabash Caye and more symbiont transcripts from Blackbird Caye. The assembled transcriptomes will facilitate gene expression studies and in silico cloning from this endangered coral.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is closely related to several metabolic diseases along with abnormal increase in fat cells. Reducing size and number of fat cells, a procedure known as lipolysis, may be used to prevent obesity as a potential therapy, which also requires fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of lipolysis at molecular level upon different types of stimulations. Here, we used low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) stimulation to investigate underlying mechanisms of the activation of lipolysis and autophagy related genes and signaling pathways of adipocytes differentiated from 3T3-L1 cells. LIPUS with the center frequency of 2 MHz was applied for 10 minutes per day for three days. After LIPUS stimulation, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot were used to determine the regulation of lipolytic factors such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). At RNA level, all three factors were upregulated while only MGL was upregulated at protein level, which presents slightly different activation pattern of lipolysis compared to widely used chemical stimulation. These results demonstrate that LIPUS stimulation can promote the lipolytic capacity of adipocytes in the differentiated state. The differences between transcriptional genes and metabolites were analyzed by transcript analysis and metabolomic profiling experiments. Cellular RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) showed an increase in lipolysis and immune-related genes and autophagy related genes after LIPUS stimulation. This study may provide an important experimental basis for the clinical applications and a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of lipolysis using LIPUS stimulation.",

Some protein language models, including MSA Transformer and AlphaFolds EvoFormer, take multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of evolutionarily related proteins as inputs. Simple combinations of MSA Transformers row attentions have led to state-of-the-art unsupervised structural contact prediction. We demonstrate that similarly simple, and universal, combinations of MSA Transformers column attentions strongly correlate with Hamming distances between sequences in MSAs. There-fore, MSA-based language models encode detailed phylogenetic relationships. We further show that these models can separate coevolutionary signals encoding functional and structural constraints from phylogenetic correlations reflecting historical contingency. To assess this, we generate synthetic MSAs, either without or with phylogeny, from Potts models trained on natural MSAs. We find that unsupervised contact prediction is substantially more resilient to phylogenetic noise when using MSA Transformer versus inferred Potts models.",

    "abstract": "Most invasive lobular breast cancers (ILC) are of the luminal A subtype and strongly hormone receptor positive. Yet, they are relatively resistant to tamoxifen and are associated with inferior long-term outcomes compared to invasive ductal cancers (IDC). In this study, we sought to gain mechanistic insights into these clinical findings that are not explained by the genetic landscape of ILC and to identify strategies to improve patient outcomes. Through a comprehensive analysis of the epigenome of ILC in pre-clinical models and clinical samples we found that compared to IDC, ILC has a distinct chromatin state that is linked to gained recruitment of FOXA1, a lineage-defining pioneer transcription factor. This results in an ILC-unique FOXA1-estrogen receptor (ER) axis that promotes the transcription of genes associated with tumor progression and poor outcomes. The ILC-unique FOXA1-ER axis leads to retained ER chromatin binding after tamoxifen treatment thereby facilitating tamoxifen resistance while remaining strongly dependent on ER signaling. Mechanistically, gained FOXA1 binding was associated with the auto-induction of FOXA1 in ILC through an ILC-unique FOXA1 binding site. Targeted silencing of this regulatory site resulted in the disruption of the feed-forward loop and growth inhibition in ILC.\n\nIn summary, we show that ILC is characterized by a unique cell state and FOXA1-ER axis that dictate tumor progression and offer a novel mechanism of tamoxifen resistance. These results underscore the importance of conducting clinical trials dedicated to patients with ILC to optimize endocrine treatments in this breast cancer subtype.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is commonly diagnosed in its late stages, and new treatment modalities are needed to improve patient outcomes and survival. We have recently established the synergistic effects of combination tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and procaspase activating compound (PAC-1) therapies in granulosa cell tumours (GCT) of the ovary, a rare form of ovarian cancer, using a mathematical model of the effects of both drugs in a GCT cell line. Here, to understand the mechanisms of combined TRAIL and PAC-1 therapy, study the viability of this treatment strategy, and accelerate preclinical translation, we leveraged our mathematical model in combination with population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) models of both TRAIL and PAC-1 to expand a realistic heterogeneous cohort of virtual patients and optimize treatment schedules. Using this approach, we investigated treatment responses in this virtual cohort and determined optimal therapeutic schedules based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic characteristics. Our results showed that schedules with high initial doses of PAC-1 were required for therapeutic efficacy. Further analysis of individualized regimens revealed two distinct groups of virtual patients within our cohort: one with high PAC-1 elimination, and one with normal PAC-1 elimination. In the high elimination group, high weekly doses of both PAC-1 and TRAIL were necessary for therapeutic efficacy, however virtual patients in this group were predicted to have a worse prognosis when compared to those in the normal elimination group. Thus, PAC-1 pharmacokinetic characteristics, particularly clearance, can be used to identify patients most likely to respond to combined PAC-1 and TRAIL therapy. This work underlines the importance of quantitative approaches in preclinical oncology.",

    "abstract": "Turgor pressure is an essential, but difficult to measure indicator of plant water status. Turgor has been quantified by localised compression of cells or tissues, but a simple method to perform these measurements is lacking. We hypothesized that changes in leaf turgor pressure can be monitored by uniaxially compressing the leaf lamina and measuring the mechanical stress under a constrained thickness (stress relaxation); and that changes in leaf water content can be monitored by measuring the thickness of the leaf lamina compressed under a constant force (creep). Using a custom-built leaf squeeze-flow rheometer, we performed different compression tests on leaves from thirteen plant species. The equilibrium mechanical stress measured during stress relaxation was correlated with leaf turgor pressure (R2 > 0.95) and thus with leaf water potential (R2 > 0.94); the equilibrium leaf thickness measured during creep was correlated with relative water content (R2 > 0.74). The coefficients of these relationships were related to the leaf osmotic pressure at the turgor-loss point. An idealised average-cell model suggests that, under isothermal conditions, the bulk cell stiffness during compression is largely determined by the leaf osmotic pressure.

    "abstract": "Pain alerts us to actual or potential tissue damage. During acute pain, our central nervous system acts endogenously to modulate pain processing, thus reducing or enhancing pain perception. However, during chronic pain, the balance between inhibitory and facilitatory processes are tipped in favour of pro-pain modulation.\n\nDiffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) is a naturally occurring pain inhibitory pathway that projects from the brainstem to the spinal cord to inhibit neuronal activity therein in a manner that is 1) subserved by noradrenaline, and 2) dysfunctional in chronicity. To harness its high therapeutic potential, we aimed to anatomically and functionally define DNIC.\n\nThrough employing an intersectional opto- and chemogenetic approach to modulate activity in brainstem noradrenergic nuclei, here we show that spinal neuronal firing observed upon DNIC activation during electrophysiological experiments, and animal pain thresholds observed during behavioural experiments, are modulated in a pro-pain manner upon opto-manipulation of A5 spinally projecting noradrenergic neurons, thus evidencing the DNIC origin.\n\nGiven the plasticity of the functional expression of DNIC in disease, and the success of back and forward translation of paradigms that evoke DNIC in pre-clinical and clinical models, our findings offer an attractive avenue of studies for disease specific analgesic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases and neurotraumatic injuries are typically age-associated disorders that can reduce neuron survival, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity leading to loss of cognitive capacity, executive function, and motor control. In pursuit of reducing the loss of said neurological functions, novel compounds are sought that promote neuron viability, neuritogenesis, and/or synaptic plasticity. Current high content in vitro screenings typically use cells that are iPSC-derived, embryonic, or originate from post-natal tissues; however, most patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma are of middle-age and older. The chasm in maturity between the neurons used in drug screens and those in a target population is a barrier for translational success of in vitro results. It has been historically challenging to culture adult neurons let alone conduct screenings; therefore, age-appropriate drug screenings have previously not been plausible. We have modified Miltenyis protocol to increase neuronal yield, neuron purity, and neural viability at a reduced cost to expand our capacity to screen compounds directly in primary adult neurons. Furthermore, we have developed the first morphology-based screening system using adult cortical neurons. By using primary adult cortical neurons from mice that were 4 to 48 weeks old for screening of a library of pharmaceuticals, we have demonstrated age- and sex-dependent effects on neuritogenesis and neuron survival in vitro. Utilizing age- and sex-appropriate in vitro models to find novel compounds increasing neuron survival and neurite outgrowth, made possible by our modified adult neuron processing method, will greatly increase the relevance of in vitro screening for finding neuroprotective compounds.",

    "abstract": "Conversion of astrocytes to neurons (AtN) is a promising potential strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have reported that shRNA-, CasRx-, or ASO-mediated Ptbp1 suppression could reprogram resident astrocytes to neurons1-3. However, some groups have disputed the data interpretation of the reported AtN conversion events4-7. These controversies surrounding AtN conversion may due to differences in the astrocyte fate-mapping systems they applied from that in the original study, i.e., recombinant mouse strains with astrocyte specific reporter constructs versus AAV-based labeling systems. Here, we applied AAV-based tracing systems to label astrocytes with GFAP-driven HA-tagged Cas13X (AAV-GFAP::Cas13X-NLS-HA-sgPtbp1). Compared to GFAP-driven tdTomato reporter (AAV-GFAP::tdTomato) system in previous studies, we found no AtN conversion in mouse striatum. Furthermore, no intermediate neurons and no neuron density increase suggested no AtN conversion. Our findings indicated that inconsistent AtN outcomes may arise from different fate-mapping systems between AAV and transgenic mice, as well as through use of different reporter proteins. Thus, the complexity of astrocyte labeling systems warrants careful attention when drawing conclusions about whether AtN conversion occurs.",

    "abstract": "The recently discovered cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) is related to eukaryotic cGAS-STING anti-viral immunity and is present in diverse prokaryotes. However, our understanding of how CBASS detects, inhibits, and co-evolves with phages is limited because CBASS function has only been studied in reconstituted heterologous systems. Here, we identify a phage-encoded CBASS antagonist (acbIIA1, anti-cbass type II-A gene 1) necessary for phage replication in the presence of endogenous CBASS immunity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. acbIIA1 homologs are encoded by numerous lytic and temperate phages infecting Gram-negative bacteria. Deletion of acbIIA1 renders multiple phages susceptible to CBASS, but phages can then escape immune function via mutations in the major capsid gene. These mutants suggest that CBASS is activated by, or targets, the late-expressed phage capsid. Together, we establish a native model system to study CBASS and identify a common phage-encoded CBASS antagonist, demonstrating that CBASS is a bona fide anti-phage immune system in nature.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/486325v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a4bb64org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ade0forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@78e1b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@28f556_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The enteric pathogens cycle between nutrient rich host and nutrient poor external environment. These pathogens compete for nutrients in the host as well as in external environment and also often experience starvation. In this context, we have studied the role of a global nitrogen regulator (NtrC) of Salmonella Typhimurium. The ntrC mutation caused extended lag phase and slow growth in minimal media. In lag phase the wild-type cells showed [~]60 fold more expression of ntrC as compared to log phase cells. The role of ntrC gene is often studied with respect to nitrogen scavenging in a low nitrogen growing condition. However, our observation indicates that, even in the adequate supply of nitrogen, the ntrC null mutants failed to adapt to new nutrient conditions and were slow to exit from the lag phase. Gene expression studies at lag phase showed down-regulation of the genes involved in carbon/nitrogen transportation and metabolism in {Delta}ntrC mutant. In the co-culture competition studies, we observed that ntrC knockout was unable to survive with the wild-type Salmonella and E. coli. We also observed that the {Delta}ntrC mutant did not survive long term nitrogen starvation (150 days). Critical analysis of starvation survival revealed that, ntrC gene is essential for recycling of nutrients from the dead cells. The nutrient recycling efficiency of {Delta}ntrC mutant was [~] 12 times less efficient than wild-type. Hence, the current work establishes that ntrC expression at the lag phase is essential for competitive fitness of Salmonella to survive in an environment having low and fluctuating nutrient conditions.\n\nImportanceSalmonella Typhimurium, both inside or outside of the host organism face enormous competition from other microorganisms. The competition may take place either in steady or in fluctuating climatic conditions. Thus, how Salmonella Typhimurium survive under such overlapping stress conditions, remained unclear. Therefore, here we report that, a global regulator NtrC, which is also a part of two-component system, activates the set of genes and operons involved in rapid adaptation and efficient nutrient recycling/scavenging. These properties, make cell able to compete with other microbes, under characteristic feast- or-famine life style of Salmonella Typhimurium. Therefore, this piece of work helps us to understand the starvation physiology of enteric bacterial pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium.",

Traditional PRS prediction methods are predominantly for European population. The accuracy of PRS prediction in non-European populations is diminished due to much smaller sample size of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this article, we introduced a novel method to construct PRS for non-European populations, abbreviated as TL-Multi, by conducting transfer learning framework to learn useful knowledge from European population to correct the bias for non-European populations. We considered non-European GWAS data as the target data and European GWAS data as the informative auxiliary data. TL-Multi borrows useful information from the auxiliary data to improve the learning accuracy of the target data while preserving the efficiency and accuracy. To demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method, we applied TL-Multi to predict the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Asian population and the risk of asthma in Indian population by borrowing information from European population. TL-Multi achieved better prediction accuracy than the competing methods including Lassosum and meta-analysis in both simulations and real applications.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that demyelination associated with multiple sclerosis alters coupling between axons in a diseased nerve tract due to exposure of ion channels. In this work we ask the question whether the presence of electric fields as a coupling mechanism between nerve axons, has any impact on the expected conduction properties of the nerve under focal demyelination. Using an approximate geometry for a bundle of three axons, we allow electric fields generated at a node of Ranvier to influence other nodes of Ranvier on different axons. In order to introduce focal demyelination, we allow a new type of structure, intermediate between a node and an internodal segment. We find that the nerves conduction profiles are different with and without field-based coupling. This is important because it opens up the possibility for an experimental investigation to study whether field-based coupling predominates over current-based coupling. Fields and currents may also be measured using different methods and so there are implications for bio-instrumentation. From a systems perspective, the study is based on a novel equation which allows electric fields to act as sources of current at axons nodes of Ranvier, thereby generating new behaviors from the set of coupled partial differential equations that model the electrodynamics of the nerve. In addition to our simulation study of focal demyelination, we present a justification for a certain geometric W-matrix used in our phenomenological 2019 model. We also provide the first simulations of a tract of tortuous axons, showing the impact of tract tortuosity on conduction velocity. The tortuous model is analyzed geometrically to illustrate the mechanism of synchronization. Finally, this same model is shown to be castable as a learning machine - a formulation that has neuroscience implications.",

Despite targeting a conserved motif, only some mAbs show broad neutralizing activity in vitro against alpha and beta coronaviruses, including Omicron BA.1 variant and bat WIV-1, and reduce viral titers and pathology in vivo. Structural and functional analyses show that the fusion peptide-specific mAbs bind with different modalities to a cryptic epitope which is concealed by prefusion-stabilizing  2P mutations and becomes exposed upon binding of ACE2 or ACE2-mimicking mAbs.

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has indicated that receptor-like kinase (RLK) autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation triggered by RLK are early and essential events for RLK function. However, the structural and biochemical basis for these early events is largely unclear. Herein, we used RLK FERONIA (FER) as a model and crystallized its core kinase domain (FER-KD) in the dephosphorylated state. We found that FER-KD adopts an active conformation in its crystal structure. Moreover, FER-KD mutants with reduced or no catalytic activity also adopt an active conformation before phosphorylation. Collectively, these observations suggest that FER employs a phosphorylation-independent active state before ligand-induced phosphorylation and full activation. We further demonstrated that FER is a dual-specificity kinase and that autophosphorylation on Tyr residues lags somewhat behind Ser/Thr phosphorylation. More importantly, Tyr phosphorylation is essential for FER-KD to initiate substrate GRP7 phosphorylation. Our work provides a paradigm to study the mechanisms of the early steps of RLK signaling initiation and highlights its \"active\" form and Tyr phosphorylation-gated roles in response to signaling stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Interfacial enzyme reactions are common in nature and in industrial settings, including the enzymatic deconstruction of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste. Kinetic descriptions of PET hydrolases are necessary for both comparative analyses, discussions of structure-function relations and rational optimization of technical processes. We investigated whether the Sabatier principle could be used for this purpose. Specifically, we compared the kinetics of two well-known PET hydrolases, leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) and a cutinase from the bacterium T. fusca (TfC) when adding different concentrations of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). We found that CTAB consistently lowered the strength of enzyme-PET interactions, while its effect on enzymatic turnover was strongly biphasic. Thus, at gradually increasing CTAB concentrations, turnover was initially promoted and subsequently suppressed. This correlation with maximal turnover at an intermediate binding strength is in accordance with the Sabatier principle. One consequence of these results is that both enzymes had too strong intrinsic interaction with PET for optimal turnover, especially TfC, which showed a 20-fold improvement of kcat at the maximum. LCC on the other hand had an intrinsic substrate affinity closer to the Sabatier optimum and the turnover rate was 5-fold improved at weakened substrate binding. Our results show that the Sabatier principle may indeed rationalize enzymatic PET degradation and support process optimization. Finally, we suggest that future discovery efforts should consider enzymes with weakened substrate binding, since strong adsorption seems to limit their catalytic performance.\n\nToC graphics O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Retinal glial cells-- microglia, astrocytes, and Muller glia--provide homeostatic support, regulate vascular blood flow, and react to injury by releasing inflammatory cytokines. Glial reactivity has been shown to be relevant for retinal vascular pathology and neuronal death. Non-apoptotic expression of endothelial caspase-9 (EC Casp9) was recently identified as a key mediator of retinal edema, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and neurodegeneration in retinal vein occlusion (RVO). In the current study we aimed to determine the glial responses that are modulated by EC Casp9 as a means to identify relevant neuro-immune mechanisms for the development of retinal edema and neurodegeneration. To this end we used a mouse model of RVO and a tamoxifen inducible EC Casp9 KO mouse line. We show that EC Casp9 leads to an increase in reactive microglia and to macrogliosis in a time-dependent manner. RVO induced an EC Casp9 dependent astroglial caspase-6 and cleavage of GFAP. Cytokine array analysis revealed that RVO increases expression of inflammatory cytokines out of which CX3CL1, IGF-1, IL-4, LIX, IL-1, M-CSF, TNF-, IL-1{beta}, IL-10, and VEGF-A, were regulated by EC Casp9. Moreover, we found that EC Casp9 deletion resulted in protection from contrast sensitivity decline one day post-RVO. These results demonstrate that caspase-9 in hypoxic endothelial cells regulates retinal inflammatory signaling in microglia, astrocytes and Muller cells and changes in visual function.",

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the three affected parrots and their parents.\n\nResultsThe brains of affected parrots exhibited neuronal loss, spongiosis, and Lewy bodies in the neocortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal vagal nucleus, in some cerebellar Purkinje cells, and in the basal ganglia. Proteasome activity was significantly reduced in the affected parrots compared to a control (p<0.05). WGS identified a single homozygous missense mutation (p.V559L) in a highly conserved amino acid residue within the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the Calcium Dependent Secretion Activator 2 (CADPS2) gene. Previous studies suggest that CADPS2 is expressed at high levels in the substantia nigra where it regulates BDNF release. Thus, disruption of CADPS2 function could impact survival of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, CADPS2 expression is in part regulated by two well established PD genes, LRRK2 and SNCA.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest that a homozygous mutation in the CADPS2 gene causes a severe neurodegenerative phenotype with Lewy bodies in parrots. Although CADPS2 variants have not been reported to cause PD in humans, further investigation of the gene in model organisms might provide important insights into the pathophysiology of Lewy body disorders.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy is emerging as a powerful strategy for cancer therapy; however, an important safety consideration is the potential for off-tumor recognition of normal tissue. This is particularly important as ligand-based CARs are optimized for clinical translation. Our group has developed and clinically translated an IL13(E12Y) ligand- based CAR targeting the cancer antigen IL13R2 for treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). There remains limited understanding of how IL13-ligand CAR design impacts the activity and selectivity for the intended tumor-associated target IL13R2 versus the more ubiquitous unintended target IL13R1. In this study, we functionally compared IL13(E12Y)-CARs incorporating different intracellular signaling domains, including first-generation CD3{zeta}- containing CARs (IL13{zeta}), second-generation 4-1BB- (CD137) or CD28-containing CARs (IL13- BB{zeta} or IL13-28{zeta}), and third-generation CARs containing both 4-1BB and CD28 (IL13-28BB{zeta}). In vitro co-culture assays at high tumor burden establish that 2nd generation IL13-BB{zeta} or IL13- 28{zeta} outperform first-generation IL13{zeta} and 3rd generation IL13-28BB{zeta} CAR designs, with IL13- BB{zeta} providing superior CAR proliferation and in vivo anti-tumor potency in human xenograft mouse models. IL13-28{zeta} displayed a lower threshold for antigen recognition, resulting in higher off-target IL13R1 reactivity both in vitro and in vivo. Syngeneic mouse models of GBM also demonstrate safety and anti-tumor potency of murine IL13-BB{zeta} CAR T cells delivered systemically after lymphodepletion. These findings support the use of IL13-BB{zeta} CARs for greater selective recognition of IL13R2 over IL13R1, higher proliferative potential, and superior anti-tumor responsiveness. This study exemplifies the potential of modulating factors outside the antigen targeting domain of a CAR to improve selective tumor recognition..",

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 encodes multiple accessory proteins that modulate host antiviral immunity by different mechanisms. Among all SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins, ORF8 is rapidly evolving and a deletion in this protein has been linked to milder disease. Here, we studied the effect of ORF8 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Specifically, we found that ORF8 can bind monocytes as well as NK cells. Strikingly, ORF8 binds CD16a (Fc{gamma}RIIIA) with nanomolar affinity and decreases the overall level of CD16 at the surface of monocytes and, to a lesser extent, NK cells. Strikingly, this decrease significantly reduces the capacity of PBMCs and particularly monocytes to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Overall, our data identifies a new immune-evasion activity used by SARS-CoV-2 to escape humoral responses.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing yield during bacterial enzyme production could have positive economic and environmental impacts. For cell factories, such improvements in yields could potentially be obtained by fine-tuning the metabolic processes and their regulatory mechanisms for gene candidates. In pursuit of such candidates, we performed RNA-sequencing of two -amylase producing Bacillus strains and predict hundreds of putative novel non-coding transcribed regions. Complex operons that are regulated by a wide variety of transcription factors, non-coding and structured RNAs add to the challenge of finding yield-affecting candidates. Surprisingly, we found that non-coding genomic regions are proportionally undergoing the highest changes in expression during fermentation (75% of novel RNA predictions had absolute logFC > 2). Since these classes of RNA are also understudied, we targeted the corresponding genomic regions with CRIPSRi knockdown to test for any potential impact on the yield. From differentially expressed annotations, including both novel candidate and prior annotated ncRNAs, we selected 53 non-coding candidates. The targeting with CRISPRi knockdowns transcription in a genomic region on both the sense and the antisense strand. Thus, the CRISPRi experiment cannot link causes for yield changes to the sense or antisense disruption. Nevertheless, we observed on several instances with strong changes in enzyme yield. The knockdown targeting the genomic region for a putative antisense RNA of the 3 UTR of the skfA-skfH operon led to a 21% increase in yield. In contrast, the knockdown targeting the genomic regions of putative antisense RNAs of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (ctaD), the sigma factor sigH, and the uncharacterized gene yhfT decreased yields by 31 to 43%.",

    "abstract": "Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomerase-independent telomere maintenance mechanism utilized by about 15% of cancers. Orphan nuclear receptors (NRs), such as COUP-TF1, COUP-TF2, EAR2, TR2, and TR4, associate with telomeres of ALT cells by binding to variant telomeric repeats. However, how these orphan NRs function in the ALT pathway remains to be characterized. Here, we have established an ALT-inducing cell model by tethering orphan NRs to telomeres in non-ALT BJ fibroblast cells. We demonstrate that recruitment of orphan NRs to telomeres is sufficient to initiate formation of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (APBs) and telomeric DNA synthesis at APBs. We found that the ability of orphan NRs to initiate APB formation and recombination is dependent on the orphan NR AF2 domain, the zinc-finger protein ZNF827, and PML protein. Depletion of orphan NRs in ALT cell lines reduced APB formation and telomeric DNA synthesis, confirming the role of orphan NRs in ALT cells. Furthermore, we found that ATRX/DAXX depletion, together with the telomeric localization of orphan NRs, induces APB formation, telomere clustering, and telomeric DNA synthesis more dramatically in non-ALT cells. Accordingly, we propose that these events in ALT, orphan NR recruitment to telomeres and ATRX/DAXX loss, operate in concert to activate the ALT pathway.",

Mic19 promotes Mic60 tetramerization via a conserved interface between the Mic60 mitofilin and Mic19 CHCH domains.

    "abstract": "The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery has been shown to be centrally involved in repair of damage to both the plasma and lysosome membranes. ESCRT recruitment to sites of damage occurs on a fast time scale, and Ca2+ has been proposed to play a key signaling role in the process. Here, we show that the Ca2+-binding regulatory protein ALG-2 binds directly to negatively charged membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Next, by monitoring the colocalization of ALIX with ALG-2 on negatively charged membranes, we show that ALG-2 recruits ALIX to the membrane. Furthermore, we show that ALIX recruitment to membrane orchestrates the downstream assembly of late-acting CHMP4B, CHMP3, CHMP2A subunits along with the AAA+ ATPase VPS4B. Finally, we show that ALG-2 can also recruit the ESCRT-III machinery to the membrane via the canonical ESCRT-I/II pathway. Our reconstitution experiments delineate the minimal sets of components needed to assemble the entire membrane repair machinery and open a new avenue for mechanistic understanding of endolysosomal membrane repair.\n\nSignificance statementOne of the ways by which protein aggregates can propagate and lead to progression of a neurodegenerative disease is by damaging the membrane that is destined to degrade the misfolded, aggregated protein. ESCRT machinery has been implicated in sealing these damaged membranes, and the nature of the membrane recruitment trigger signal for this machinery is a major open question. Here, we show in vitro that ALG-2 can bring ESCRT machinery to membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Chorea-acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome are diseases with shared clinical manifestations caused by mutations in VPS13A and XK, respectively. Key features of these conditions are the degeneration of caudate neurons and the presence of abnormally shaped erythrocytes. XK belongs to a family of plasma membrane (PM) lipid scramblases whose action results in exposure of PtdSer at the cell surface. VPS13A is an ER-anchored lipid transfer protein with a putative role in the transport of lipids at contacts of the ER with other membranes. Recently VPS13A and XK were reported to interact by still unknown mechanisms. So far, however, there is no evidence for a colocalization of the two proteins at contacts of the ER with the PM, where XK resides, as VPS13A was shown to be localized at contacts between the ER and either mitochondria or lipid droplets. Here we show that VPS13A can also localize at ER-PM contacts via the binding of its PH domain to a cytosolic loop of XK, that such interaction is regulated by an intramolecular interaction within XK and that both VPS13A and XK are highly expressed in the caudate neurons. Binding of the PH domain of VPS13A to XK is competitive with its binding to intracellular membranes that mediate other tethering functions of VPS13A. Our findings support a model according to which VPS13A-dependent lipid transfer between the ER and the PM is coupled to lipid scrambling within the PM. They raise the possibility that defective cell surface exposure of PtdSer may be responsible for neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 protein is an effector that plays a major role in a prokaryotic adaptive immune system, by which invading DNA can be targeted and cut for inactivation. The Cas9 endonuclease is directed to target sites by a guide RNA (gRNA) where Cas9 can recognize specific sequences (PAMs) in foreign DNA, which then serve as an anchoring point for cleavage of the adjacent RNA-matching DNA region. Although the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been widely studied and repurposed for diverse applications (notably, genome editing), its origin and evolution remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigate the evolution of Cas9 from resurrected ancient nucleases (anCas) in extinct firmicutes species as old as 2600 myr to the current day. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that these ancient forms were much more flexible in their PAM and gRNA scaffold requirements compared to modern day Cas9 enzymes. In addition, anCas portrays a gradual paleoenzymatic adaptation from nickase to double-strand break activity, suggesting a mechanism by which ancient CRISPR systems could propagate when harboring Cas enzymes with minimal PAMs. The oldest anCas also exhibit high levels of activity with ssDNA and ssRNA targets, resembling Cas nucleases in related system types. Finally, we illustrate editing activity of the anCas enzymes in human cells. The prediction and characterization of anCas proteins uncovers an unexpected evolutionary trajectory leading to ancient enzymes with extraordinary properties.",

These attributes along with genetic tractability make Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 an attractive candidate for industrial scale production of specialty and commodity chemicals. One such strain produces limonene, an energy dense diesel jet fuel drop-in additive, at a titer of 4 mg/L over a four-day incubation period. In this study, we use the state-of-the-art whole-cell characterization tool, isotopically non-stationary 13C metabolic flux analysis (INST-13CMFA) to determine intracellular fluxes through the pathways of central metabolism for the limonene producing strain and wild type strain of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. We find similar flux distribution in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, photorespiration, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. The key difference between strains is observed in the production of pyruvate. The limonene producing strain displays significantly higher flux through the amphibolic pathways of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and the malic enzyme to synthesize pyruvate, while the wild type strain uses pyruvate kinase in a single step. Our findings suggest that this flux distribution is a mechanism to recover a physiologically optimal ratio of ATP to NADPH. The upregulation of this amphibolic pathway may act to restore the physiological ATP:NADPH ratio that has been disturbed by limonene biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and evolve worldwide, despite intense efforts to develop multiple vaccines and therapeutic options against COVID-19. Moreover, the precise role of SARS-CoV-2 in the pathophysiology of the nasopharyngeal tract (NT) is still unfathomable. Therefore, we used the machine learning methods to analyze 22 RNA-seq datasets from COVID-19 patients (n=8), recovered individuals (n=7), and healthy individuals (n=7) to find disease-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In comparison to healthy controls, we found 1960 and 153 DEG signatures in COVID-19 patients and recovered individuals, respectively. We compared dysregulated DEGs to detect critical pathways and gene ontology (GO) connected to COVID-19 comorbidities. In COVID-19 patients, the DEG- miRNA and DEG-transcription factors (TFs) interactions network analysis revealed that E2F1, MAX, EGR1, YY1, and SRF were the most highly expressed TFs, whereas hsa-miR-19b, hsa-miR-495, hsa-miR-340, hsa-miR-101, and hsa-miR-19a were the overexpressed miRNAs. Three chemical agents (Valproic Acid, Alfatoxin B1, and Cyclosporine) were abundant in COVID-19 patients and recovered individuals. Mental retardation, mental deficit, intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, micrognathism, and cleft palate were the significant diseases associated with COVID-19 by sharing DEGs. Finally, we detected DEGs impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection and mediated by TFs and miRNA expression, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to various comorbidities. These pathogenetic findings can provide some crucial insights into the complex interplay between COVID-19 and the recovery stage and support its importance in the therapeutic development strategy to combat against COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIMPORTANCEDespite it has now been over two years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many crucial questions about SARS-CoV-2 infection and the different COVID-19 symptoms it causes remain unresolved. An intriguing question about COVID-19 is how SARS-CoV-2 interplays with the host during infection and how SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause so many disease symptoms. Our analysis of three different datasets (COVID-19, recovered, and healthy) revealed significantly higher DEGs in COVID-19 patients than recovered humans and healthy controls. Some of these DEGs were found to be co-expressed in both COVID-19 patients. They recovered humans supporting the notion that DEGs level is directly correlated with the viral load, disease progression, and different comorbidities. The protein-protein interaction consisting of 24 nodes and 72 edges recognized eight hub-nodes as potential hub-proteins (i.e., RPL4, RPS4X, RPL19, RPS12, RPL19, EIF3E, MT-CYB, and MT-ATP6). Protein-chemical interaction analysis identified three chemical agents (e.g., Valproic Acid, Alfatoxin B1, and Cyclosporine) enriched in COVID-19 patients and recovered individuals.

    "abstract": "The introduction of CRISPR/Cas9 based gene editing has greatly accelerated therapeutic genome editing. However, the off-target DNA cleavage by CRISPR/Cas9 protein hampers its clinical translation, thereby hindering its widespread use as a programmable genome editing tool. Although Cas9 variants with better mismatch discrimination have been developed, they have significantly lower rates of on-target DNA cleavage. Here, we have compared the dynamics of a more specific naturally occurring Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9) to the most widely used, SpCas9 protein. Long-scale atomistic MD simulations of free and gRNA-bound forms of both the Cas9 proteins were performed, and their domain rearrangements and binding affinity with gRNA were compared to decipher the possible reason behind the enhanced specificity of FnCas9 protein. The greater binding affinity with gRNA, high domain electrostatics, and more volatility of FnCas9 than SpCas9 may explain its increased specificity and lower tolerance for mismatches.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe gRNA binding led to the opening of the structure of Cas9 endonuclease and exposure of hydrophobic residues to accommodate it.\nC_LIO_LIConcerted domain movement was observed in both SpCas9 (HNH-REC2 domains, CTD-Topo domains, and REC3-RuvC) and FnCas9 (HNH-REC3-REC1 and PI-WED-RuvC).\nC_LIO_LIBoth Cas9s have shown a decrease in percentage helicity and an increase in the percentage of structurally dynamic residues (more secondary structural transitions) post gRNA binding.\nC_LIO_LIIn the gRNA-bound form of FnCas9, the PAM-interacting domain was found to have a larger structural transition and increased coil%.\nC_LIO_LIElectrostatic interactions have a major contribution to the high binding affinity of FnCas9 with gRNA.\nC_LIO_LIArginine-helix has shown a pivotal role in the binding of gRNA in FnCas9 protein.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of A{beta}42 is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease. It is still not known what the biochemical changes are inside a cell which will eventually lead to A{beta}42 aggregation. Thermogenesis has been associated with cellular stress, the latter of which may promote aggregation. We perform intracellular thermometry measurements using fluorescent polymeric thermometers (FPTs) to show that A{beta}42 aggregation in live cells leads to an increase in cell-averaged temperatures. This rise in temperature is mitigated upon treatment with an aggregation inhibitor of A{beta}42 and is independent of mitochondrial damage that can otherwise lead to thermogenesis. With this, we present a diagnostic assay which could be used to screen small-molecule inhibitors to amyloid proteins in physiologically relevant settings. To interpret our experimental observations and motivate the development of future models, we perform classical molecular dynamics of model A{beta} peptides to examine the factors that hinder thermal disspation. We observe that this is controlled by the presence of ions in its surrounding environment, the morphology of the amyloid peptides and the extent of its hydrogen-bonding interactions with water. We show that aggregation and heat retention by A{beta} peptides are favoured under intracellular-mimicking ionic conditions, which could potentially promote thermogenesis. The latter will, in turn, trigger further nucleation events that accelerate disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Activating Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) mutations occur in pediatric neuroblastoma and are associated with poor prognosis. To study ALK-activating mutations in a genetically controllable system we employed CRIPSR/Cas9, incorporating orthologues of the human oncogenic mutations ALKF1174L and ALKY1278S in the Drosophila Alk locus. AlkF1251L and AlkY1355S mutant Drosophila exhibit enhanced Alk signaling phenotypes, but unexpectedly depend on the Jelly belly (Jeb) ligand for activation. Both AlkF1251L and AlkY1355S mutant larval brains display hyperplasia, represented by increased numbers of Alk-positive neurons. Despite this hyperplasic phenotype, no brain tumors were observed in mutant animals. We show that hyperplasia in Alk mutants was not caused by significantly increased rates of proliferation, but rather by decreased levels of apoptosis in the larval brain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify perturbations during temporal fate specification in AlkY1355S mutant mushroom body lineages. These findings shed light on the role of Alk in neurodevelopmental processes and highlight the potential of activating Alk mutations to perturb specification and promote survival in neuronal lineages.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer related deaths in women and there are few effective therapies against this advanced disease. Emerging evidence suggests that key steps of tumor progression and metastasis are controlled by reversible epigenetic mechanisms. Using an in vivo genetic screen, we identified WDR5 as an actionable epigenetic regulator that is required for metastatic progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer. We found that knockdown of WDR5 in breast cancer cells independently impaired their tumorigenic as well as metastatic capabilities. Mechanistically, WDR5 promotes cell growth by increasing ribosomal gene expression and translation efficiency in a KMT2-independent manner. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition or degradation of WDR5 impedes cellular translation rate and the clonogenic ability of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, combination of WDR5-targeting with mTOR inhibitors leads to potent suppression of translation and proliferation of breast cancer cells. These results reveal novel therapeutic strategies to treat metastatic breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Ocular neovascular diseases including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) are widespread causes of blindness. Patients non-responsiveness to currently used biologics that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) poses an unmet need for novel therapies. Here, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as a novel therapeutic target for nvAMD. PRMT5 is a well-known epigenetic enzyme. We previously showed that PRMT5 methylates and activates a proangiogenic and proinflammatory transcription factor, the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B), which has a master role in tumor progression, notably in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer. We identified a potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of PRMT5, PR5-LL-CM01, that dampens the methylation and activation of NF-{kappa}B. Here for the first time, we assessed the antiangiogenic activity of PR5-LL-CM01 in ocular cells. Immunostaining of human nvAMD sections revealed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid where neovascularization occurs, while mouse eyes with laser induced choroidal neovascularization (L-CNV) showed PRMT5 is overexpressed in the retinal ganglion cell layer and in the RPE/choroid. Importantly, inhibition of PRMT5 by PR5-LL-CM01 or shRNA knockdown of PRMT5 in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived choroidal endothelial cells (iCEC2) reduced NF-{kappa}B activity and the expression of its target genes, such as tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) and VEGF-A. In addition to inhibiting angiogenic properties of proliferation and tube formation, PR5-LL-CM01 blocked cell cycle progression at G1/S-phase in a dose-dependent manner in these cells. Thus, we provide the first evidence that inhibition of PRMT5 impedes angiogenesis in ocular endothelial cells, suggesting PRMT5 as a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate ocular neovascularization.",

    "abstract": "Multi-trophic parasites often modulate host behaviors and development to attract other hosts. However, whether these modulations are controlled by specific parasite genes and are adaptive remains debated. Insect-transmitted phytoplasma parasites take control of their plant host by turning them into  Zombie plants, which feature spectacular vegetative organ proliferations and juvenilization. The phytoplasma effector SAP05 induces these symptoms by mediating the degradation of multiple plant SPL and GATA developmental transcription factors via recruiting the ubiquitin receptor RPN10. Here, we investigated if these SAP05-induced modulations impact the leafhopper vectors on which phytoplasmas depend for spread. SAP05 promotes leafhopper reproduction on Arabidopsis thaliana in a RPN10-dependent manner. Moreover, SAP05 homologs that degrade SPLs and both SPLs and GATAs promote leafhopper reproduction, whereas those that degrade only GATAs do not. Leafhoppers also produced more progeny on plants with misregulated MiR156, which suppresses SPL expression. SPLs control several developmental processes. Surprisingly, leaf color and shape changes and increased leaf numbers did not correlate to leafhopper progeny increases, whereas disturbing the plant phase transition processes did. Therefore, only specific phenotypes induced by a single parasite gene extend beyond one host to control another and promote host-host attractions of a multi-trophic parasite.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering signalling pathways is essential to understanding how organisms respond to environmental cues but elucidating how these signalling pathways evolve in new environments is less clear.1,2 Most plants, for example, monitor multiple environmental cues to optimize the time and place to germinate. Some root parasitic plants, however, germinate in response to small molecules like strigolactones (SLs) emanating from host roots3,4 whilst a number of ephemeral weeds germinate in response to chemicals called karrikins (KARs) released after a forest fire.5,6 Although these species represent distinct clades, they use the same HYPOSENSITIVE TO LIGHT/KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (HTL/KAI2) signalling pathway to perceive strigolactones or karrikins, which suggests convergent evolution.3,5 Because specialist lifestyles are derived traits, it is not clear if HTL/KAI2 signalling in these species evolved from a specific germination-signalling pathway or whether this pathway had other functions that were co-opted for specialist germination circumstances. Here, we show HTL/KAI2 signalling in Arabidopsis bypasses the light requirement for germination. In part, this is because the HTL/KAI2 downstream component, SMAX1 impinges on PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 1/PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 5 (PIF1/PIL5)-regulated hormone response pathways conducive to germination. We identified Arabidopsis accessions that can germinate in the dark, which had altered expression of HTL/KAI2 signalling components, suggesting that divergence in this signalling pathway occurs in nature. Moreover, Arabidopsis HTL/KAI2-regulated gene signatures were observed in germinating Striga seed. The ability of HTL/KAI2 signalling to substitute for light advances an explanation for how some specialist plants evolved their underground germination behaviour in response to specific environments.",

    "abstract": "TGA transcription factors, which bind their target DNA through a conserved basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, are vital regulators of gene expression in salicylic acid (SA)-mediated plant immunity. Here, we investigate the role of StTGA2.1, a potato TGA lacking the full bZIP, which we name a mini-TGA. Such truncated proteins have been widely assigned as loss-of-function mutants. We, however, confirm that StTGA2.1 overexpression compensates for SA-deficiency. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we show that StTGA2.1 can physically interact with StTGA2.2 and StTGA2.3, while its interaction with DNA was not detected. We investigate the changes in transcriptional regulation due to StTGA2.1 overexpression, identifying direct and indirect target genes. Using in planta transactivation assays, we confirm that StTGA2.1 interacts with StTGA2.3 to activate StPRX07, a member of class III peroxidases, which are known to play role in immune response. Finally, via structural modelling and molecular dynamics simulations, we hypothesise that the compact molecular architecture of StTGA2.1 distorts DNA conformation upon heterodimer binding to enable transcriptional activation. This study demonstrates how protein truncation can lead to novel functions and that such events should be studied carefully in other protein families.",

To characterize synaptic failure in the spinal cord (SC) in the Tg-SOD1/G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we applied a method we originally designed to isolate cortical and hippocampal SNs to SC tissue. Interestingly, we found that the SC SNs were isolated in a different gradient fraction to the cortical/hippocampal SNs. We compared the relative levels of synaptoneurosomal proteins in control (Tg-SOD1) animals, with Tg-SOD1/G93A mice at onset and those that were symptomatic using iTRAQ proteomics.

Furthermore, T cell activation is accompanied by reprogramming of cellular metabolism to provide the energy and building blocks for proliferation, differentiation and effector function. Transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) has pleiotropic effects on T cell populations, having both an essential role in the maintenance of immune tolerance but also context-dependent pro-inflammatory functions. We set out to define the mechanisms underpinning the suppressive effects of TGF{beta} on mouse CD8+ T cell activation. RNA-sequencing analysis of TCR-stimulated T cells determined that Myc-regulated genes were highly enriched within gene sets downregulated by TGF{beta}. Functional analysis demonstrated that TGF{beta} impeded TCR-induced upregulation of amino acid transporter expression, amino acid uptake and protein synthesis. Furthermore, TCR-induced upregulation of Myc-dependent glycolytic metabolism was substantially inhibited by TGF{beta} treatment with minimal effects on mitochondrial respiration or mTOR activation. Thus, our data suggest that inhibition of Myc-dependent metabolic reprogramming represents a major mechanism underpinning the suppressive effects of TGF{beta} on CD8+ T cell activation.",

    "abstract": "Sexual reproduction is a ubiquitous and ancient trait of eukaryotic life. While sexual organisms are usually faced with the challenge of finding a compatible mating partner, species as diverse as animals, plants, and fungi have repeatedly evolved the ability to reproduce sexually without an obligate requirement for another individual. Here, we uncovered the underlying mechanism of self-compatibility (homothallism) in Cryptococcus depauperatus, a fungal species sister to the clinically relevant human fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii species complexes. In contrast to C. neoformans or C. gattii, which grow as a yeast in the asexual stage, and produce hyphae, basidia, and infectious spores during the sexual stage, C. depauperatus grows exclusively as hyphae decorated with basidia and abundant spores and appears to be continuously engaged in sexual reproduction. By combining the insights from comparative genomics and genetic analyses of mutants defective in key mating and meiosis genes, we demonstrate the sexual cycle of C. depauperatus involves meiosis, and reveal that self-compatibility is orchestrated by the expression, in the same cell, of an unlinked mating receptor (Ste3a) and pheromone ligand (MF) pair seemingly derived from opposite mating types of a heterothallic (self-sterile) ancestor. We identified a putative mating-type (MAT) determining region containing genes phylogenetically aligned with MATa alleles of other species, and a few MAT gene alleles scattered and unlinked throughout the genome, but no homologs of the mating-type homeodomain genes SXI1 (HD1) and SXI2 (HD2). Comparative genomic analyses suggested a dramatic remodeling of the MAT locus possibly owing to reduced selective constraints to maintain mating-type genes in tight linkage, associated with a transition to self-fertility. Our findings support C. depauperatus as an obligately sexual, homothallic fungal species and provide additional insight into the repeated transitions between modes of sexual reproduction that have occurred throughout the fungal kingdom.",

    "abstract": "Tight regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics is necessary for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. The MT destabilizing Kinesin-8, Kif18B, controls astral MT dynamics and spindle positioning. Kif18B interacts with importin /{beta} as well as with the plus-tip tracking protein EB1, but how these associations modulate Kif18B is not known. We mapped the key binding sites on Kif18B, made residue-specific mutations, and assessed their impact on Kif18B function. Blocking EB1 interaction disrupted Kif18B MT plus-end accumulation and inhibited its ability to control MT length on monopolar spindles in cells. Blocking importin /{beta} interaction disrupted Kif18B localization without affecting aster size. In vitro, importin /{beta} increased Kif18B MT association by increasing the on-rate and decreasing the off-rate from MTs, which stimulated MT destabilization. In contrast, EB1 promoted MT destabilization without increasing lattice binding in vitro, which suggests that EB1 and importin /{beta} have distinct roles in the regulation of Kif18B-mediated MT destabilization. We propose that importin /{beta}-spatially modulate Kif18B association with MTs to facilitate its MT destabilization activity. Our results suggest that Ran-regulation is important not only to control molecular motor function near chromatin but also provides a spatial control mechanism to modulate MT binding of NLS-containing spindle assembly factors.",

    "abstract": "TopBP1 is a large scaffold protein with multiple functions in genome integrity. We previously identified a novel role for TopBP1 during M phase by showing that TopBP1 reduces carry-over of DNA damage to daughter cells. This function emerges as a critical backup pathway in BRCA deficient cells, yet many aspects of TopBP1 regulation during mitosis are unclear. The mitotic kinase PLK1 has been reported to interact with TopBP1 but the functional relevance of this is unclear. Here, we identify and characterize a conserved PLK1 docking site in TopBP1. Endogenous deletion of the PLK1 docking site in TopBP1 results in increased number of mitotic TopBP1 foci, increased DNA damage in daughter cells, deficient mitotic DNA repair synthesis and increased frequency of binucleation. At the same time, cell cycle distribution and ATR activation are normal in cells with the PLK1 docking site deletion in TopBP1. Interestingly, mutation of this site in TopBP1 renders cells sensitive to PARP inhibitors but not to camptothecin hinting to different cellular effects of the two chemotherapeutics. Altogether, our data indicate that the PLK1-TopBP1 interaction is critical for the mitotic function of TopBP1.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to represent a global health emergency as a highly transmissible, airborne virus. An important coronaviral drug target for treatment of COVID-19 is the conserved main protease (Mpro). Nirmatrelvir is a potent Mpro inhibitor and the antiviral component of Paxlovid. The significant viral sequencing effort during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represented a unique opportunity to assess potential nirmatrelvir escape mutations from emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. To establish the baseline mutational landscape of Mpro prior to the introduction of Mpro inhibitors, Mpro sequences and its cleavage junction regions were retrieved from [~]4,892,000 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in GISAID. Any mutations identified from comparison to the reference sequence (Wuhan-hu-1) were cataloged and analyzed. Mutations at sites key to nirmatrelvir binding and protease functionality (e.g., dimerization sites) were still rare. Structural comparison of Mpro also showed conservation of key nirmatrelvir contact residues across the extended Coronaviridae family (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-coronaviruses). Additionally, we showed that over time the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme remained under purifying selection and was highly conserved relative to the spike protein. Now, with the EUA approval of Paxlovid and its expected widespread use across the globe, it is essential to continue large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro evolution. This study establishes a robust analysis framework for monitoring emergent mutations in millions of virus isolates, with the goal of identifying potential resistance to present and future SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.\n\nImportanceThe recent authorization of oral SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, such as Paxlovid, has ushered in a new era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergence of new variants, as well as selective pressure imposed by antiviral drugs themselves, raise concern for potential escape mutations in key drug binding motifs. To determine the potential emergence of antiviral resistance in globally circulating isolates and its implications for the clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates before, during, and after the introduction of new antiviral treatments is critical. The infrastructure built herein for active genetic surveillance of Mpro evolution and emergent mutations will play an important role in assessing potential antiviral resistance as the pandemic progresses and Mpro inhibitors are introduced. We anticipate our framework to be the starting point in a larger effort for global monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutational landscape.",

Here we found that their function is modulated in a time- and sleep-dependent manner naturally during the day. We first show that PV-evoked inhibition is stronger by the end of the light (ZT12) compared to the end of dark (ZT0) cycle. In addition, both PVs excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission slowly oscillate but in the opposite directions during the light/dark cycle. Whereas excitatory synapses are predominantly regulated by experience, inhibitory synapses are regulated by sleep. Mechanistically, we found that the daily regulation of PVs inhibitory synapses is mediated by acetylcholine activating M1 receptors. Consistent with our ex vivo findings, we show in vivo that PVs spontaneous activity display clear oscillation, which is opposite to that of the pyramidal neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that the daily changes in PV neural activity negatively correlate with the dLGN-evoked responses in V1, underscoring the physiological significance of PVs daily regulation.",

    "abstract": "Genetic liability associated with schizophrenia most frequently arises from common genetic variation that confers small individual effects and contributes to phenotypes only when considered in aggregate. These risk variants are typically non-coding and act by genetically regulating the expression of one or more gene targets (eGenes), but the mechanisms by which unlinked eGenes interact to contribute to complex genetic risk remains unclear. Here we apply a pooled CRISPR approach to evaluate in parallel ten schizophrenia eGenes in human glutamatergic neurons. Querying the shared neuronal impacts across eGenes reveals shared downstream transcriptomic impacts (\"convergence\") concentrated on pathways of brain development and synaptic signaling. The composition and strength of convergent networks is influenced by both the similarity of eGene functional annotation and the strength of eGene co-expression in human postmortem brain tissue. Convergent networks resolve distinct patterns of eGene up-regulation associated with individual-level risk in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that are broadly enriched for neuropsychiatric disorder risk genes and may represent molecular subtypes of schizophrenia. Convergent gene targets are druggable as novel points of therapeutic intervention. Overall, convergence suggests a model to explain how non-additive interactions arise between risk genes and may explain cross-disorder pleiotropy of genetic risk for psychiatric disorders.",

Here, we examine all six such amino acid substitutions in the three proteins known to have key roles in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation and to be highly expressed in the stem cells of the developing neocortex. When we introduce these modern human-specific substitutions in the mouse, three substitutions in two of these proteins, KIF18a and KNL1, cause a prolongation of metaphase and a reduction in chromosome segregation errors in apical progenitors of the developing neocortex. Conversely, the ancestral substitutions cause a reduction in metaphase length and an increase in chromosome segregation errors in human brain organoids. Our data also show that, in these aspects, Neandertals were more similar to chimpanzees than to modern humans. Thus, the fidelity of chromosome segregation during neocortex development improved in modern humans after their divergence from Neandertals.",

    "abstract": "The emergent coherent population activity from thousands of stochastic neurons in the brain is believed to constitute a key neuronal mechanism for salient processing of external stimuli and its link to internal states like attention and perception. In the sensory cortex, functional cell assemblies are formed by recurrent excitation and inhibitory influences. The stochastic dynamics of each cell involved is largely orchestrated by presynaptic CAV2.1 voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Cav2.1 VGCCs initiate the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic compartment and are therefore able to add variability into synaptic transmission which can be partly explained by their mobile organization around docked vesicles. To investigate the relevance of Cav2.1 channel surface mobility for the input processing in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in vivo, we make use of a new optogenetic system which allows us to acutely cross-link Cav2.1 VGCCs via a photo-cross-linkable cryptochrome mutant, CRY2olig. In order to map neuronal activity across all cortical layers of the A1, we performed laminar current-source density (CSD) recordings with varying auditory stimulus sets in transgenic mice with a citrine tag on the N-terminus of the VGCCs. Clustering VGCCs suppresses overall sensory-evoked population activity, particularly when stimuli lead to a highly synchronized distribution of synaptic inputs. Our findings reveal the importance of membrane dynamics of presynaptic calcium channels for sensory encoding by dynamically adjusting network activity across a wide range of synaptic input strength.\n\nStatement of SignificanceVoltage Gated Calcium Channel (VGCC) mobility plays an important role in neuronal firing dynamics. Failure of these channels to function or be regulated has been linked to migraine and ataxia. We here link the microscopic process of VGCC mobility to the mesoscopic population dynamics as a mechanism to regulate and appropriately amplify synaptic inputs of different strengths to the mouse primary auditory cortex. We also demonstrate a novel and effective technique with which VGCC function can be further explored in meso- or macroscopic scales and with behaving subjects. We believe that this is of importance to the broader scientific community in aspects of non-linear scaling in the brain, potential translational applications, and basic research on cortical mechanisms of physiological function.",

Changes in APA have been associated with multiple biological processes and disease phenotypes. However, the role of hormones and their drug analogs in APA remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated transcriptome-wide the impact of glucocorticoids on APA in 30 human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. We found that glucocorticoids could regulate APA of a subset of genes, possibly by changing the expression of 142 RNA-binding proteins, some with known APA-regulating properties. Interestingly, genes with glucocorticoid-mediated APA were enriched in viral translation-related pathways, while genes with glucocorticoid-mediated expression were enriched in interferon and interleukin pathways, suggesting that glucocorticoid-mediated APA might result in functional consequences distinct from gene expression. Glucocorticoid-mediated APA was also cell-type-specific, suggesting an action of glucocorticoids that may be unique to immune regulation. We also observed evidence for genotype-dependent glucocorticoid-mediated APA, providing potential functional mechanisms for a series of common genetic variants that had previously been associated with immune disorders, but without a clear mechanism. In summary, this study reports a series of novel observations regarding the impact of glucocorticoids on APA, suggesting novel avenues for mechanistic studies of hormonal biology.",

    "abstract": "Spatial cognitive abilities allow individuals to remember the location of food patches, predator hide-outs, or shelters. Animals typically incorporate learnt spatial information or use external environmental cues to navigate their surroundings. A spectacular example of how some fishes move is through aerial jumping. For instance, fish that are trapped within isolated pools, cut off from the main body of water during dry periods, may jump over obstacles and direct their jumps to return to safe locations. However, what information such re-orientation behaviour during jumping is based on remains enigmatic. Here we combine a lab and field experiment to test if guppies (Poecilia reticulata) incorporate learnt spatial information and external environmental cues (visual and auditory) to determine where to jump. In a spatial memory assay we found that guppies were more likely to jump towards deeper areas, hence incorporating past spatial information to jump to safety. In a matched vs. mismatched spatial cue experiment in the field, we found that animals only showed directed jumping when visual and auditory cues matched. We show that in unfamiliar entrapments guppies direct their jumps by combining visual and auditory cues, while in familiar entrapments they use a cognitive map. We hence conclude that jumping behaviour is a goal-directed behaviour, guided by different sources of information and involving important spatial cognitive skills.",

While sophisticated 3D tissues can be generated, technology that can accurately monitor these complex models in a high-throughput and non-invasive manner is not well adapted. Here we show the development of 3D bioelectronic devices based on the electroactive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) - PEDOT:PSS and their use for non-invasive, electrical monitoring of stem cell growth. We show that the electrical, mechanical and wetting properties as well as the pore size/architecture of 3D PEDOT:PSS scaffolds can be fine-tuned simply by changing the processing crosslinker additive. We present a comprehensive characterization of both 2D PEDOT:PSS thin films of controlled thicknesses, and 3D porous PEDOT:PSS structures made by the freeze-drying technique. By slicing the bulky scaffolds we show that homogeneous, porous 250 um thick PEDOT:PSS slices are produced, generating biocompatible 3D constructs able to support stem cell cultures. These multifunctional membranes are attached on Indium-Tin oxide substrates (ITO) with the help of an adhesion layer that is used to minimize the interface charge resistance. The optimum electrical contact result in 3D devices with a characteristic and reproducible, frequency dependent impedance response. This response changes drastically when human adipose derived stem cells grow within the porous PEDOT:PSS network as revealed by fluorescence microscopy. The increase of these stem cell population within the PEDOT:PSS porous network impedes the charge flow at the interface between PEDOT:PSS and ITO, enabling the interface resistance to be extracted by equivalent circuit modelling, used here as a figure of merit to monitor the proliferation of stem cells. The strategy of controlling important properties of 3D PEDOT:PSS structures simply by altering processing parameters can be applied for development of a number of stem cell in vitro models. We believe the results presented here will advance 3D bioelectronic technology for both fundamental understanding of in vitro stem cell cultures as well as the development of personalized therapies.",

Current 3D imaging methods suffer from low resolution and are limited in their ability to distinguish cell types and their spatial relationships. We present a novel 3D workflow: MATRICS-A (Multiplexed Image Three-D Reconstruction and Integrated Cell Spatial - Analysis) that generates a 3D map of cells from multiplexed images and calculates cell type distance from endothelial cells and other features of interest. We applied this workflow to multiplexed data from sequential skin sections from younger and older donors (n=10; 33-72 years) with biopsies from ten anatomical regions with different sun exposure effects (mild, moderate-marked). Up to 26 sequential sections from each sample underwent multiplexed imaging with 18 biomarkers covering 12 cell types (keratinocytes (granular, spinous, basal), epithelial and myoepithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, T helpers, T killers, T regs, neurons and endothelial cells, markers of DNA damage and repair (p53, DDB2) and cell proliferation (Ki67). Following cell classification, the tissue and classified cells were reconstructed into 3D volumes. A significant inverse correlation between DDB2 positive cells and age was found (corr= -0.78, adj. p=0.047). This suggests reduced capacity for repair in non-cancer older sun-exposed individuals. While absolute immune cell count did not differ by age or sun exposure, the ratio of T Helper/T Killer cells was positively correlated with age (corr=0.82, adj. p=0.048) This is the first such 3D study in skin and paves the way for cataloging more cell types and spatial relationships in aging and disease in skin and other organs.",

    "abstract": "Dietary nitrate lowers the oxygen cost of human exercise. This effect has been suggested to result from stimulation of coupling efficiency of skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation by reduced nitrate derivatives. In this paper, we report the acute effects of sodium nitrite on the bioenergetic behaviour of L6 myocytes. At odds with improved efficiency of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, extracellular flux analysis reveals that a [1/2]-hour exposure to NaNO2 (0.1 - 5 {micro}M) significantly decreases mitochondrial coupling efficiency in static myoblasts and tends to lower it in spontaneously contracting myotubes. Unexpectedly, NaNO2 stimulates the rate of glycolytic ATP production in both myoblasts and myotubes. Increased ATP supply through glycolysis does not emerge at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation, which means that NaNO2 acutely increases the rate of overall myocellular ATP synthesis, highly significantly so in myoblasts and tending towards significance in contractile myotubes. Notably, NaNO2 exposure shifts myocytes to a more glycolytic phenotype. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption does not decrease after NaNO2 exposure, and non-mitochondrial respiration tends to drop. When total ATP synthesis rates are normalised to total cellular oxygen consumption rates, it thus transpires that NaNO2 lowers the oxygen cost of ATP supply in L6 myocytes.",

    "abstract": "Precise spatial patterning of cell fate during morphogenesis requires accurate inference of cellular position. In making such inferences from morphogen profiles, cells must contend with inherent stochasticity in morphogen production, transport, sensing and signalling. Motivated by the multitude of signalling mechanisms in various developmental contexts, we show how cells may utilise multiple tiers of processing (compartmentalisation) and parallel branches (multiple receptor types), together with feedback control, to bring about fidelity in morphogenetic decoding of their positions within a developing tissue. By simultaneously deploying specific and nonspecific receptors, cells achieve a more accurate and robust inference. We explore these ideas in the patterning of Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal disc by Wingless morphogen signalling, where multiple endocytic pathways participate in decoding the morphogen gradient. The geometry of the inference landscape in the high dimensional space of parameters provides a measure for robustness and delineates stiff and sloppy directions. This distributed information processing at the scale of the cell highlights how local cell autonomous control facilitates global tissue scale design.",

    "abstract": "Protein domains biased toward a few amino acid types are vital for the formation of biomolecular condensates in living cells. These membraneless compartments are formed by molecules exhibiting a range of molecular motions and structural order. Missense mutations increase condensate persistence lifetimes or structural order, properties that are thought to underlie pathological protein aggregation. We examined seeded fibrils of the T-cell restricted intracellular antigen-1 low complexity domain and determined residues 338-357 compose the rigid fibril core. Aging of wild-type and P362L mutant low complexity domain liquid droplets resulted in fibril assemblies that are structurally distinct from the seeded fibril preparation. The results show that most disease mutations lie outside the region that forms homogeneous fibril structure, the droplets age into conformationally heterogenous fibrils, and the P362L disease mutation does not favor a specific fibril conformation.",

    "abstract": "FOXG1 Syndrome (FS) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutation of the FOXG1 gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator important for telencephalic brain development. People with FS have marked developmental delays, impaired ambulation, movement disorders, seizures, and behavior abnormalities including autistic features. Current therapeutic approaches are entirely symptomatic, however the ability to rescue phenotypes in mouse models of other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Phelan-McDermid syndrome by postnatal expression of gene products has led to hope that similar approaches could help modify the disease course in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as FS. While FoxG1 protein function plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, the ongoing adult expression of FoxG1 and behavioral phenotypes that present when FoxG1 function is removed postnatally provides support for opportunity for improvement with postnatal treatment. Here we generated a new mouse allele of Foxg1 that disrupts protein expression and characterized the behavioral and structural brain phenotypes in heterozygous mutant animals. These mutant animals display changes in locomotor behavior, gait, anxiety, social interaction, aggression, and learning and memory compared to littermate controls. Additionally, they have structural brain abnormalities reminiscent of people with FS. This information provides the framework for future studies to evaluate the potential for post-natal expression of FoxG1 to modify the disease course in this severe neurodevelopmental disorder.",

    "abstract": "Methylation is a widely occurring modification that requires the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and acts in regulation of gene expression and other processes. SAM is synthesized from methionine, which is imported or generated through the 1-carbon cycle (1CC). Alterations in 1CC function have clear effects on lifespan and stress responses, but the wide distribution of this modification has made identification of specific mechanistic links difficult. Exploiting a dynamic stress-induced transcription model, we find that two SAM synthases in Caenorhabditis elegans, SAMS-1 and SAMS-4, contribute differently to modification of H3K4me3, gene expression and survival. We find that sams-4 enhances H3K4me3 in heat shocked animals lacking sams-1, however, sams-1 cannot compensate for sams-4, which is required to survive heat stress. This suggests that the regulatory functions of SAM depend on its enzymatic source and that provisioning of SAM may be an important regulatory step linking 1CC function to phenotypes in aging and stress.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact site dynamics plays a central role for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). ER localized calcium sensor STIM1 translocates to the contact sites, interacts with Orai and mediates calcium influx from the extracellular environment. Different species of phosphoinositides (PIPs) have been reported to be involved in contact site dynamics as well as STIM1 translocation. However, most of the studies were based on loss-of-function experiments or conditions that generate massive calcium store depletion. The kinetics of ER-PM contact site dynamics during physiological stimuli -induced calcium oscillations are not well understood. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we investigated the relationship between dynamics of STIM1 as well as cortical ER (cER) proteins and calcium oscillations in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. Surprisingly, a significant percentage of cells displayed cyclic STIM1 and cER dynamics that were calcium-independent. Using specific lipid sensors, we showed that cyclic ER-PM contact site assembly was in phase with PI(4)P oscillation, but preceded phases of PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3 oscillation. Optogenetic recruitment of the phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase from INPP5E, which decreased PI(4,5)P2 and increased PI(4)P levels on the plasma membrane, stimulated the translocation of STIM1 and inhibited calcium oscillations. Interestingly, prolonged stable translocation of STIM1 to the plasma membrane had an inhibitory effect on calcium oscillations. Collectively, our findings suggest that ER-PM contact sites formation is PI(4)P-dependent. In addition, reversibility of ER-PM contact sites dynamics and intermediate strength of ER-PM contact are needed for calcium oscillation.",
