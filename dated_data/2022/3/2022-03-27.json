    "abstract": "Disrupted processing of social cues and altered social behaviors are among the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and they emerge as early as the first year of life. These differences in sensory abilities may affect the ability of children with ASDs to securely attach to a caregiver and experience caregiver buffering of stress. Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) has been used to model some aspects of ASDs in rodents. Here, we asked whether prenatal VPA exposure altered infant rats behavioral responsivity to maternal olfactory cues in an odor preference test and affected maternal buffering of infants stress responsivity to shock. In the odor preference test, one-week old rats treated with VPA during pregnancy appeared to have impaired social recognition and/or may be less motivated to approach social odors in early infancy. These effects were particularly prominent in female pups. In two-week old rats, VPA-exposed pups and saline-exposed pups showed similar preferences for home cage bedding. Although VPA-exposed pups may initially have a deficit in this attachment-related behavior they do recover typical responses to home cage bedding in later infancy. Both control and VPA-exposed pups showed robust stress hormone responses to repeated shocks, an effect which was blocked when a calm mother was present during shock exposure. No sex differences in the effect of maternal presence on the stress response to shock and no interactions between sex and prenatal drug exposure were observed. Although VPA-exposed pups may show impaired responsivity to maternal cues in early infancy, maternal presence is still capable of regulating the stress response in VPA-exposed pups. In this study we demonstrate the importance of utilizing multiple batteries of tests in assessing behavior, dissecting the behavior on one test into different components. Our results inform about the underlying behavioral characteristics of some of the ASD phenotypes, including sex differences reported by clinical studies, and could shed light on potential opportunities for intervention.",

    "abstract": "The time we spend asleep is adjusted to previous time spent awake, and therefore believed to be under tight homeostatic control. Here, we establish microglia as a new cellular component of the sleep homeostat circuit. By using quantitative phosphoproteomics we demonstrate that microglia-derived TNF controls thousands of phosphorylation sites during the sleep period. Substrates of microglial TNF comprise sleep-promoting kinases and numerous synaptic proteins, including a subset whose phosphorylation status codes sleep need and determines sleep duration. As a result, lack of microglial TNF attenuates the build-up of sleep need, as measured by slow wave activity, and prevents immediate compensation for loss of sleep. Together, we propose that microglia control sleep homeostasis by releasing TNF that acts at the neuronal circuitry through dynamic control of phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Opioids like fentanyl are the mainstay treatment for chronic pain. Unfortunately, opioids high addiction liability has led to the current opioid crisis. This is in part related to long-term use side-effects, including analgesic tolerance (gradual decrease in analgesia), and physical dependence (withdrawal symptoms upon opioid interruption), causing dose-escalation and preventing usage interruption. Altered circadian rhythmicity and sleep patterns are common in patients on opioid therapy. Prior research showed intricate bidirectional interactions between circadian rhythmicity, opioid analgesic efficacy, and side-effects. However, underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) is a circadian transcription factor that is highly expressed in structures of the central nervous system that modulate pain and opioids. In this study, we used male and female mice expressing non-functional NPAS2 (NPAS2 deficient, NPAS2-/-) to investigate the role of NPAS2 in fentanyl analgesia, tolerance, hyperalgesia, and dependence. In NPAS2-/- mice, we found that thermal pain thresholds, acute analgesia, and tolerance to a fixed dose of fentanyl were largely like wild-type mice. However, female NPAS2-/- mice augmented behavioral state of analgesic tolerance and exhibited significantly more behavioral symptoms of physical dependence. Conversely, only male NPAS2-/- mice had increased fentanyl-induced hypersensitivity, when compared to matched-sex littermate controls. Together, our findings suggest sex-specific effects of NPAS2 signaling in the regulation of fentanyl-induced tolerance, hyperalgesia, and dependence.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations often occur as transient bursts with variable amplitude and frequency dynamics. Quantifying these effects is important for understanding brain-behaviour relationships, especially in continuous datasets. To robustly measure bursts, rhythmical periods of oscillatory activity must be separated from arrhythmical background 1/f activity, which is ubiquitous in electrophysiological recordings. The Better OSCillation (BOSC) framework achieves this by defining a power threshold above the estimated background 1/f activity, combined with a duration threshold. Here we introduce a modification to this approach called fBOSC which uses a spectral parametrisation tool to accurately model background 1/f activity in neural data. fBOSC (which is openly available as a MATLAB toolbox) is robust to power spectra with oscillatory peaks and can also model non-linear spectra. Through a series of simulations, we show that fBOSC more accurately models the 1/f power spectrum compared with existing methods. fBOSC was especially beneficial where power spectra contained a \"knee\" below [~]0.5-10 Hz, which is typical in neural data. We also found that, unlike other methods, fBOSC was unaffected by oscillatory peaks in the neural power spectrum. Moreover, by robustly modelling background 1/f activity, the sensitivity for detecting oscillatory bursts was standardised across frequencies (e.g. theta- and alpha-bands). Finally, using openly available resting state magnetoencephalography and intracranial electrophysiology datasets, we demonstrate the application of fBOSC for oscillatory burst detection in the theta-band. These simulations and empirical analyses highlight the value of fBOSC in detecting oscillatory bursts, including in datasets that are long and continuous with no distinct experimental trials.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=102 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485674v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b0b40org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cfc616org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5f09eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a8419b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG To determine a power threshold for burst detection, the Better OSCillation framework (BOSC) estimates background 1/f activity by modelling neural power spectra.

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a common and complex neurodegenerative disorder. Loss of neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) is a hallmark of PD neuropathology; the etiology of PD remains unclear. Single-cell (-nucleus) RNA sequencing (sc or snRNAseq) has significantly advanced our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers, but limited progress has been made in PD. Here we generated by far the largest snRNAseq data of high-quality 315,867 nuclei from the human SN including 9 healthy controls and 23 idiopathic PD cases across different Braak stages. Clustering analysis identified major brain cell types including DA neurons, excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, glial cells, endothelial, pericytes, fibroblast and T-cells in the human SN. By combining immunostaining and validating against the datasets from independent cohorts, we identified three molecularly distinct subtypes of DA-related neurons, including a RIT2-enriched population, in human aged SN. All DA neuron subtypes degenerated in PD, whereas the composition of non-neuronal cell clusters including major glial types showed little change. Our study delineated cell-type-specific PD-linked gene expression in the SN and their alterations in PD. Examination of cell-type-based transcriptomic changes suggests the complexity and diversity of molecular mechanisms of PD. Analysis of the remaining DA neurons of the three subtypes from PD demonstrated alterations of common gene sets associated with neuroprotection. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of DA neurons in the human SN and suggest molecular basis for vulnerability and resilience of human DA neurons in PD. Our cohort thus provides a valuable resource for dissecting detailed mechanisms of DA neuron degeneration and identifying new neuroprotective strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "The complex visually mediated behaviors of diurnal lizards are enabled by a retina typically containing five types of opsins with the potential for tetrachromatic color vision. Despite lizards using a wide range of color signals, the limited variation in photoreceptor spectral sensitivities across lizards suggests only weak selection for species-specific, spectral tuning of photoreceptors. Some species, however, have enhanced short wavelength sensitivity, which likely helps with the detection of signals rich in ultraviolet and short wavelengths. In this study, we examined the visual system of Tiliqua rugosa, which has a UV/blue tongue, to determine the spectral sensitivity of the eye and to gain insight into this species visual ecology. Electroretinograms coupled with spectral stimulation showed peak sensitivity at 560 nm with high similarity to other lizards at wavelengths greater than 530 nm. However, at shorter wavelengths, sensitivity is enhanced leading to a spectral sensitivity curve that is 28 nm broader (full width at half height) than other lizards studied so far. The width of the curve is partially explained by a population of photoreceptors that respond more strongly to low temporal frequencies with possible peaks in sensitivity between 460 and 470 nm suggesting that they are SWS2 photoreceptors. The lack of a peak in sensitivity at 360 nm at low temporal frequencies and under a monochromatic light that suppresses the response of LWS photoreceptors, suggests that the SWS1 photoreceptors are red-shifted. In addition, the yellow and green oil droplets that are common in other diurnal lizards appear to be missing and instead, only transparent and pale-yellow oil droplets are present. LWS photoreceptors are likely paired with pale-yellow oil droplets to produce LWS photoreceptors with wider spectral sensitivity curves than in other lizards. Opsin sequencing reveals SWS1, SWS2, RH1, RH2 and LWS opsin genes that are very similar to the visual opsins detected in the green anole, Anolis carolinensis, suggesting there is little change in the spectral sensitivity of photoreceptors compared to other diurnal lizards. Since we only obtained a partial sequence of the SWS1 opsin, we were unable to determine whether amino acid substitution at tuning sites could have played a role in red-shifting the SWS1 photoreceptor spectral sensitivity. Photoreceptor densities are typically higher in central and ventral retinal regions than in the dorsal retina suggesting that higher spatial sampling is necessary at eye level and above the animal than on the ground. However, the SWS1 photoreceptors do not follow this pattern potentially due to their low abundance making them less relevant to high acuity visual tasks. Our findings demonstrate that there are possibly multiple mechanisms acting synergistically in the visual system of T. rugosa to enhance short wavelength sensitivity between 360 and 530 nm. While it is tempting to suggest that this is an adaptation to facilitate the detection of the blue tongues of conspecifics, additional experiments are necessary to determine its ecological relevance.\n\nSummary statementColor vision and the distribution of photoreceptor subtypes in T. rugosa",

    "abstract": "Callous-Unemotional (CU) traits are often associated with impairments in perspective taking and cognitive control (regulating goal directed behavior); and adolescents with CU traits demonstrate aberrant brain activation/connectivity in areas underlying these processes. Together cognitive control and perspective taking are thought to link mechanistically to explain CU traits. Because increased cognitive control demands modulate perspective taking ability among both typically developing samples and individuals with elevated CU traits, understanding the neurophysiological substrates of these constructs could inform efforts to alleviate societal costs of antisocial behavior. The present study uses GIMME to examine the heterogenous functional brain properties (i.e., connection density, node centrality) underlying cognitive controls influence on perspective taking among adolescents on a CU trait continuum. Results reveal that cognitive control had a negative indirect association with CU traits via perspective taking; and brain connectivity indirectly associated with lower CU traits - specifically the social network via perspective taking and conflict network via cognitive control. Additionally, less negative connection density between the social and conflict networks was directly associated with higher CU traits. Our results support the growing literature on cognitive controls influence on socio-cognitive functioning in CU traits and extends that work by identifying underlying functional brain properties.",

    "abstract": "Background and HypothesisSchizophrenia research arose in the last decades, focusing more on its neural basis. Executive functions such as decision making and cognitive flexibility are the main cognitive areas that are impaired and are considered schizophrenia endophenotypes. Recently, cognitive impairment has been connected with the ablation of glutamatergic NMDARs resulting in increased cortical activity. Selective NMDARs antagonists such as dizocilpine have been used to model cognitive inflexibility in schizophrenia. Moreover, a decreased GABAergic inhibitory activity has been shown elsewhere along with the enhanced cortical activity. This NMDARs/GABA unbalanced ratio may reduce the entrainment of prefrontal gamma and hippocampal theta rhythm, resulting in a prefrontal-hippocampal gamma/theta band desynchronization.\n\nStudy DesignThe study addressed the role of acute administrations of dizocilpine to model schizophrenia-like cognitive inflexibility in rats. We used a new version of the attentional set-shifting task, where rats learned switching/reversing the relevant rule. Moreover, we used the new ASST after dizocilpine systemic injections to test cognitive flexibility. Finally, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulations at specific light pulses of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus.\n\nResultsThe first experiments showed that acute dizocilpine in rats reproduced schizophrenia-like cognitive inflexibility. The second set of experiments demonstrated that appropriate optogenetic light pulses frequencies could rescue the cognitive flexibility previously altered by acute dizocilpine.\n\nConclusionsThese findings advance our knowledge on the pivotal role of parvalbumin interneurons in schizophrenia-like cognitive impairment and may serve as a standpoint for further research of this severe psychiatric disorder.",

Nutrient availability also impacts T-cell functionality via metabolic and biosynthetic processes that are largely unexplored.

Here, we review the pertinent literature on this topic and highlight the newly identified role of TNFR2 as a metabolic regulator for thymus-derived (t)Tregs.

Furthermore, we adoptively transferred heart-specific T-cells that were pre-differentiated in vitro towards pro-inflammatory versus regulatory phenotypic states to dissect how they differentially regulate post-myocardial infarction (MI) inflammation.\n\nResultsFlow cytometry and single-cell transcriptomics findings reveled that transferred TCR-M cells rapidly acquired an induced regulatory phenotype (iTreg) in the infarcted myocardium and blunt local inflammation. Myocardial TCR-M cells differentiated into two main lineages enriched with cell activation and pro-fibrotic transcripts (e.g. Tgfb1) or with suppressor immune checkpoints (e.g. Pdcd1), which we also found in human myocardial tissue. These cells produced high levels of latency-associated peptide (LAP) and inhibited interleukine-17 (IL-17) responses. Notably, TCR-M cells that were pre-differentiated in vitro towards a regulatory phenotype maintained a stable in vivo FOXP3 expression and anti-inflammatory activity when adoptively transferred prior to MI induction. In contrast, TCR-M cells that were pre-differentiated in vitro towards a pro-inflammatory TH17 phenotype were partially converted towards a regulatory phenotype in the injured myocardium and blunted myocardial inflammation.\n\nConclusionsThese findings reveal that the myocardial milieu provides a suitable environment for iTreg differentiation and reveals novels mechanisms by which the healing myocardium shapes local immunological processes.",

While allelic variation at alr1 and alr2 can predict the phenotypes in inbred lines, these two loci do not entirely predict the allorecognition phenotypes in wild-type colonies and their progeny, suggesting the presence of additional uncharacterized genes that improve the prediction of these phenotypes. Comparative genomics analyses were used to identify coding sequence differences in assembled chromosomal intervals of the ARC and genomic scaffold sequences between two incompatible H. symbiolongicarpus siblings from a backcross population. New IgSF-like genes are reported for the ARC, five of these genes are closely related to the alr1 and alr2 genes, suggesting the presence of multiple alr-type genes within this complex. Cloning evidence revealed that the allelic polymorphism of eight Ig-SF-like genes is associated with allorecognition phenotypes in a backcross population of H. symbiolongicarpus. Remarkably, alternative splicing was found as a mechanism that contributes to the functional variability of these genes by changing putative activating receptors to inhibitory receptors, or generating secreted isoforms of allorecognition proteins. Our findings demonstrate that allorecognition in H. symbiolongicarpus is a multigenic phenomenon controlled by genetic variation in at least eight genes in the ARC complex, as well as putative uncharacterized variation outside of this region.",

Animals colonized with T.mu show severely exacerbated allergic inflammation in the airways and reveal a new protozoan-driven gut-lung axis that remotely shapes the lung immune network to potentiate chronic pulmonary inflammation.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA gut microbe exacerbates asthma severity by promoting lung eosinophilia through a tripartite lymphocyte immune network.",

    "abstract": "Protein function can be modulated by phase transitions in their material properties, which can range from liquid-to solid-like; yet the mechanisms that drive these transitions and whether they are important for physiology are still unknown. Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we show that developmental robustness is reinforced by phase transitions of the plasma membrane-bound lipid-binding protein SEC14-like. Using imaging, genetics, and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we show that SEC14-like undergoes liquid-like phase separation in the root stem cells. Outside the stem cell niche, SEC14-like associates with the caspase-like protease separase and conserved microtubule motors at unique polar plasma membrane interfaces. In these interfaces, SEC14-like undergoes abrupt processing by separase, which promotes its liquid-to-solid transition. The SEC14-like liquid-to-solid transition is important for root developmental robustness, as lines expressing an uncleavable SEC14-like variant or mutants of separase, and associated microtubule motors show similar developmental phenotypes. Furthermore, the processed and solidified but not the liquid form of SEC14-like interacts with the polar protein PINFORMED2 at the plasma membrane and perhaps other polar proteins of the PINFORMED family. This work demonstrates that robust development can involve abrupt liquid-to-solid transitions mediated by proteolysis at unique plasma membrane interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Spotted fever group rickettsioses caused by Rickettsia (R) are devastating human infections, which mainly target microvascular endothelial cells (EC) and can induce lethal EC barrier dysfunction in the brain and lungs. Our previous evidence reveals that exosomes (Exos) derived from rickettsial-infected ECs, namely R-ECExos, can induce disruption of the tight junctional (TJ) protein ZO-1 and barrier dysfunction of human normal recipient brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Given that we have observed that microRNA23a (miR23a), a negative regulator of endothelial ZO-1 mRNA, is selectively sorted into R-ECExos, the aim of the present study was to characterize the potential functional role of exosomal miR23a delivered by R-ECExos in normal recipient BMECs. We demonstrated that EC-derived Exos (ECExos) have the capacity to deliver oligonucleotide RNAs to normal recipient BMECs in an RNase-abundant environment. miR23a in ECExos impairs normal recipient BMEC barrier function, directly targeting TJ protein ZO-1 mRNAs. In separate studies using a traditional in vitro model and a novel single living-cell biomechanical assay, our group demonstrated that miR23a anti-sense oligonucleotide-enriched ECExos ameliorate R-ECExo-provoked recipient BMEC dysfunction in association with stabilization of ZO-1 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that Exo-based therapy could potentially prove to be a promising strategy to improve vascular barrier function during bacterial infection and concomitant inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Organoids hold great potential for regenerative medicine and biomedical research. While they are able to recapitulate many structural and functional aspects of their in vivo counterparts, they lack a functional vasculature. In this study, we aimed to coculture human small intestinal organoids (hSIO) with a vasculature in a triple co-culture system with endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts in a microfluidic device. Organoids and micro-vessels favour distinct matrix and medium conditions, which were optimized to sustain growth of all cell types. In addition, we found that organoids exhibit poor survival in monoculture in the microfluidic devices. Interestingly, co-culturing hSIO together with ECs and fibroblasts enhances stemness and survival of hSIO. This effect can be further enhanced by adding the GSK-3{beta} inhibitor CHIR99021 to the medium to enhance Wnt signalling. Direct contact of fibroblasts is not required for either vessel formation or for the effect on stem cell maintenance of organoids, as culturing fibroblasts in side-channels yields larger micro-vessels and better organoid survival. Additionally, we observed that the response of cells to different culture media is strongly dependent on the culture set-up as the second setup allows organoids to be cultured in angiogenic medium. Our results suggest that angiocrine signalling by the vasculature affects stem cell maintenance, which should be further investigated. Our co-culture system offers a platform to study angiocrine signalling in the small intestine, which could in the future be used to unravel different mechanisms behind endothelial mediated intestinal homeostasis and (patho) physiology.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic cell division requires that kinetochores form microtubule attachments that can segregate chromosomes and control mitotic progression via the spindle assembly checkpoint. During prometaphase, kinetochores shed a distal domain called the fibrous corona as microtubule attachments form and mature. This shedding is mediated, in part, by the minus-end directed motor dynein, which  strips kinetochore cargoes along K-fibre microtubules towards the pole. While the main molecular players are well understood, relatively little is known about how dynein stripping is regulated and how it responds to increasing microtubule occupancy. Lis1 is a conserved dynein regulator that associates with kinetochores and is mutated in the severe neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly. Here, we have combined loss-of-function studies, high-resolution imaging and engineered separation-of-function mutants to define how Lis1 contributes to dynein-mediated corona stripping. We show that cells depleted of Lis1 fail to fully dissemble the corona and delay in metaphase as a result of persistent checkpoint activation. Furthermore, we find that while kinetochore-tethered Lis1-dynein is required for attachment error-correction, the contribution of Lis1 to corona disassembly can be mediated by a rapidly cycling cytosolic pool. These findings support the idea that Lis1 contextualises dynein function at kinetochores to maintain corona disassembly into metaphase and prevent chromosome mis-segregation.",

    "abstract": "In multicellular systems, all cells exhibit transcriptional noise. However, its exact contribution to morphogenesis often remains unclear, especially in animals where cells can also move. Here we take advantage of walled plant cells, where transcriptional noise happens in tissues with a fixed topology. Using synchronously growing guard cells in stomata, we demonstrate that mutation in VIP3, a subunit of the conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C), increases transcriptional noise in Arabidopsis. This conclusion could be generalized to other group of cells at the shoot apex. Such noise translates into growth and shape defects. Indeed, in vip3 sepals, we measured higher growth heterogeneity between adjacent cells, with molecular evidence of increased local mechanical conflicts. This even culminated with the presence of negatively growing cells in specific growth conditions. Interestingly, such increased local noise makes the regional pattern of growth less clear-cut. Reduced regional conflicts lead to delay in organ growth arrest, ultimately making final organ shapes and sizes more variable. We propose that transcriptional noise is managed by Paf1C to ensure organ robustness by building up mechanical conflicts at the regional scale, instead of the local scale.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIPaf1C controls transcriptional noise in Arabidopsis\nC_LIO_LIPaf1C reduces growth heterogeneity and dampens local mechanical conflicts\nC_LIO_LIImpairing both Paf1C and microtubules can trigger negative growth in Arabidopsis\nC_LIO_LIScaling up local conflicts to regional ones with sharp boundaries contributes to organ shape robustness\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "High resolution ribosome fractionation and low-input ribosome profiling of bovine oocytes and preimplantation embryos has enabled us to define the translational landscapes of early embryo development at an unprecedented level. We analyzed the transcriptome, polysome- and non-polysome-bound RNA profiles of bovine oocytes (GV and MII stage) and early embryos at 2-, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stage, and revealed four modes of translational selectivity: i. selective translation of non-abundant mRNAs, ii. active, but modest translation of a selection of highly expressed mRNAs, iii. translationally suppressed abundant to moderately abundant mRNAs, and iv. mRNAs associated specifically with monosomes. A strong translational selection of low abundance mRNAs encoding protein components involved in metabolic pathways and lysosome was found throughout bovine oocyte and preimplantation development. In particular, genes encoding components involved in mitochondrial function were prioritized for translation. Notably, transcripts encoding proteins regulating chromatin modifications selectively translated in oocytes. We found that the translational dynamics largely reflects transcriptional profiles in oocytes and 2-cell embryos, but observed marked shift in translational control in 8-cell embryos associated with the main phase of embryonic genome activation. Subsequently, transcription and translation become better synchronized in morulae and blastocysts. Together, these data reveal a unique spatiotemporal translational regulation that accompanies bovine preimplantation development.\n\nSignificance StatementTranslational control during preimplantation embryo development is poorly understood, mostly due to the scarcity of samples and the corresponding inability to analyze low quantities of these materials. By developing a low-input method, we have been able to explore the transcriptome, polysome- and non-polysome-bound RNA profiles of bovine oocytes (GV and MII stage) and preimplantation embryos at 2-, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages. We reveal four different modes of translational selectivity, plus novel temporal regulatory mechanisms during early embryo development. The spatiotemporal translation dynamics of bovine oocytes and preimplantation embryos offer an entirely new insight into mammalian embryo development research and new possibilities for improving efficiency of assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs).",

In particular, the portable sequencing device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has the potential to facilitate hands-on training from sampling to sequencing and interpretation of mitogenomes. In this study, we present the results from sampling and sequencing six gastropod mitogenomes (Aplysia argus, Cellana orientalis, Cellana toreuma, Conus ebraeus, Conus miles and Tylothais aculeata) from a graduate level biodiversity course. The students were able to produce mitochondrial genomes from sampling to annotation using existing protocols and programs. Approximately 4Gb of sequence was produced from 15 Flongle and two R9.4 Flowcells, averaging 235Mb and N50=4.4kb per Flowcell. Five of the six 14.1-18kb mitogenomes were circlised containing all 13 core protein coding genes. Additional Illumina sequencing reveal that the ONT assemblies were able to span over highly AT rich sequence in the control region that was otherwise missing in Illumina-assembled mitogenomes, but still contained a base error of one every 70.8-346.7bp with the majority occurring at homopolymer regions. Our findings suggest that ONT are portable and can be used to rapidly produce mitogenomes at low cost and tailored to genomics-based training in biodiversity research.",

    "abstract": "Correlations belong to the standard repertoire of ecologists for quantifying the strength of dependence between two random variables. Classical dependence measures are usually not capable of detecting non-monotonic or non-functional dependencies. Furthermore, they completely fail to detect asymmetry and direction in dependence, which exist in many situations and should not be ignored. In this paper, we present qad (short for quantification of asymmetric dependence), a non-parametric statistical method to quantify directed and asymmetric dependence of bivariate samples. qad is applicable in general situations, is sensitive to noise in data, exhibits a good small sample performance, detects asymmetry in dependence, shows high power in testing for independence, requires no assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of the data, and reliably quantifies the information gain/predictability of quantity Y given knowledge of quantity X, and vice versa (i.e. q(X,Y) = q(Y, X)). Here, we briefly recall the methodology underlying qad, introduce the functions of the R-package qad, which returns estimates for the measures q(X, Y) denoting the directed dependence of Y on X (or, equivalently, the influence of X on Y), q(Y, X) the directed dependence of X on Y, a(X, Y) [colone] q(X, Y) - q(Y, X) the asymmetry in dependence. Furthermore, qad can be used to predict Y given knowledge of X, and vice versa. Additionally, we compare empirical performance of qad with that of seven other well established measures and demonstrate the applicability of qad on ecological datasets. We illustrate that direction and asymmetry in dependence are universal properties of bivariate associations. qad thus provides additional information gain and the avoidance of model bias and will therefore advance and facilitate the understanding of ecological systems.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is an important technique for characterizing protein-DNA binding in vivo. One drawback of ChIP based techniques is the lack of cell type-specificity when profiling complex tissues. To overcome this limitation, we developed SpyChIP to identify cell type-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites in native physiological contexts without tissue dissociation or nuclei sorting. SpyChIP takes advantage of a specific covalent isopeptide bond that rapidly forms between the 15 amino acid SpyTag and the 17 kD protein SpyCatcher. In SpyChIP, the target TF is fused with SpyTag by genome engineering, and an epitope tagged SpyCatcher is expressed in cell populations of interest, where it covalently binds to SpyTag-TF. Cell type-specific ChIP is obtained by immunoprecipitating chromatin prepared from whole tissues using antibodies directed against the epitope-tagged SpyCatcher. Using SpyChIP, we identified the genome-wide binding profiles of the Hox protein Ubx in two distinct cell types of the Drosophila haltere disc. Our results revealed extensive region-specific Ubx-DNA binding events, highlighting the significance of cell type-specific ChIP and the limitations of whole tissue ChIP approaches. Analysis of Ubx::SpyChIP results provided novel insights into the relationship between chromatin accessibility and Ubx-DNA binding, as well as different mechanisms Ubx employs to regulate its downstream cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). In addition to SpyChIP, we suggest that SpyTag-SpyCatcher technology, as well as other covalent interaction peptide pairs, has many potential in vivo applications that were previously unachievable.",

Despite growing popularity and increasing numbers of breeds of atypical colour and pattern variants in reptiles, only few studies have investigated the appearance and cause of various diseases associated with colour morphs. Ball pythons (Python regius) are among the most frequently bred reptiles and breeders selected for a multitude of different colour and pattern morphs. Among those colour variants, the spider morph of the ball python is frequently associated with the wobble syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine, whether a morphological variant can be found and brought in association with the clinical occurrence of the wobble syndrome in spider ball pythons, using MRI and CT-imaging as intra-vitam diagnostic methods. Data from eight ball pythons including five spider ball pythons and three wild type ball pythons was assessed and evaluated comparatively. We were able to identify distinctive structural differences in inner ear morphology in spider ball pythons highly probable to relate to the wobble syndrome. To our knowledge, these anomalies are described for the first time and represent a basis for further anatomical and genetic studies and discussions regarding animal welfare in reptile breeding.",

Previous PCA-LMM comparisons give mixed results, unclear guidance, and have several limitations, including not varying the number of principal components (PCs), simulating simple population structures, and inconsistent use of real data and power evaluations. We evaluate PCA and LMM both varying number of PCs in realistic genotype and complex trait simulations including admixed families, subpopulation trees, and real multiethnic human datasets with simulated traits. We find that LMM without PCs usually performs best, with the largest effects in family simulations and real human datasets and traits without environment effects. Poor PCA performance on human datasets is driven by large numbers of distant relatives more than the smaller number of closer relatives. While PCA was known to fail on family data, we report strong effects of family relatedness in genetically diverse human datasets, not avoided by pruning close relatives. Environment effects driven by geography and ethnicity are better modeled with LMM including those labels instead of PCs. This work better characterizes the severe limitations of PCA compared to LMM in modeling the complex relatedness structures of multiethnic human data for association studies.",

    "abstract": "The clarification of genomic signatures left during evolutionary histories of crops is crucial for breeding varieties adapting to changing climate. Soybean, a leguminous crop, provides both plant oil and protein. Here, we analyzed genome sequences of 2,214 soybeans and proposed its evolutionary route, which includes four geographic paths, expansion of annual wild soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc.) from Southern China, domestication in Central China, expansion of landrace (G. max (L.) Merr.), and local breeding. We observed that local adaptation of the wild and cultivated soybeans was largely independent, and that genetic introgression was mostly derived from sympatric rather than allopatric wild populations during the range expansion of soybean landraces. Range expansion and breeding processes were accompanied with positive selection of flowering-time genes including GmSPA3c as validated by knock-out mutants. Our study shed lights on the evolutionary history of soybean and provides valuable genetic resources for future breeding.\n\nTeaserThe expansion and selection history of soybean",

    "abstract": "The social environment has long been recognized to play an important role in substance abuse disorders (SUD). Operant conditioning is the most widely used rodent model of SUD. However, most operant chambers do not accommodate more than one rat at a time. Here, we introduce PeerPub - a novel social operant chamber. PeerPub uses a touch sensor to record the number of licks on drinking spouts. It then delivers a drop of solution with a fixed volume as the reward to the tip of the spout when the number of licks meets the requirement of a reinforcement schedule. A radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip implanted on top of each rats skull tracks the identity of the rat. The system is controlled by a Raspberry Pi computer. We tested PeerPub using male Wistar Kyoto rats in daily one-hour sessions where supersac, a solution containing glucose and saccharin, was delivered under a fixed ratio 5 schedule. We found that male rats consumed more supersac in group housing rather than in isolated conditions. These data demonstrated the utility of PeerPub in modeling the interaction between motivated behavior and social context. We anticipate devices like PeerPub will help demonstrate the role of the social environment in SUD phenotypes. The design of PeerPub is available at http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub",

Cell coupling via connexin-43 (Cx43) GJCs is important in a wide range of cellular processes in health and disease 1-3, yet the structural basis of Cx43 function and regulation has not been determined until now. Here we describe the structure of a human Cx43 GJC solved by cryo-EM and single particle analysis at 2.26 [A] resolution. The pore region of Cx43 GJC features several lipid-like densities per Cx43 monomer, located close to a putative lateral access site at the monomer boundary. We found a previously undescribed conformation on the cytosolic side of the pore, formed by the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane helix 2 of Cx43 and stabilized by a small molecule. Structures of the Cx43 GJC and hemichannels in nanodiscs reveal a similar gate arrangement. The features of the Cx43 GJC and hemichannel cryo-EM maps and the channel properties revealed by molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the captured states of Cx43 are consistent with a closed state.",

    "abstract": "Almost all biosensors that use ligand-receptor binding operate under equilibrium conditions. However, at low ligand concentrations, the equilibration with the receptor (e.g., antibodies and aptamers) become slow and thus equilibrium-based biosensors are inherently limited in making measurements that are both rapid and sensitive. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for a novel method through which biosensors can quantitatively measure ligand concentration before reaching equilibrium. Rather than only measuring receptor binding at a single time-point, the pre-equilibrium approach leverages the receptors kinetic response to instantaneously quantify the changing ligand concentration. Importantly, analyzing the biosensor output in frequency domain, rather than in the time domain, we show the degree to which noise in the biosensor affects the accuracy of the pre-equilibrium approach. Through this analysis, we provide the conditions under which the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor can be maximized for a given target concentration range and rate of change. As a model, we apply our theoretical analysis to continuous insulin measurement and show that with a properly selected antibody, the pre-equilibrium approach could make the continuous tracking of physiological insulin fluctuations possible.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneously studying different types of biomarkers (DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites) has the potential to significantly improve understanding and diagnosis for many complex diseases. However, extracting biomarkers of different types involves using several technically complex or expensive methodologies, often requiring specialized laboratories and personnel. Streamlining detection through the use of a single multiplexed assay would greatly facilitate the process of accessing and interpreting patient biomarker data. In this work, we present a method for multiplexed biomarker detection based on variable-length DNA payload chains, which are systematically disassembled in the presence of specific biomolecular targets, leading to fragments of different sizes that yield characteristic band patterns in gel electrophoresis. This strategy has enabled us to detect with high sensitivity and specificity DNA sequences including BRCA1, an RNA sequence (miR-141) and the steroid aldosterone. We show that our assay can be multiplexed, enabling simultaneous detection of different types of biomarker. Furthermore, we show that our method suffers no loss of sensitivity when conducted in fetal bovine serum and can be applied using capillary electrophoresis, which may be more amenable to automation and integration in healthcare settings.\n\nToC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485867v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b4169org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d36ebdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b69e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55dc00_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Despite the growing number of epigenetic datasets, new tools are still needed to discover novel distinctive patterns of heterogeneous epigenetic signals at regulatory elements.\n\nResultsWe introduce ChromDMM, a product Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model for clustering genomic regions that are characterised by multiple chromatin features. ChromDMM extends the mixture model framework by profile shifting and flipping that can probabilistically account for inaccuracies in the position and strand-orientation of the genomic regions. Owing to hyper-parameter optimisation, ChromDMM can also regularise the smoothness of the epigenetic profiles across the consecutive genomic regions. With simulated data, we demonstrate that ChromDMM clusters, shifts, and strand-orients the profiles more accurately than previous methods. With ENCODE data, we show that the clustering of enhancer regions in the human genome reveals distinct patterns in several chromatin features. We further validate the enhancer clusters by their enrichment for transcriptional regulatory factor binding sites.\n\nAvailabilityThe software is available at https://github.com/MariaOsmala/ChromDMM",

    "abstract": "Influenza viruses pose significant threats to public health and cause enormous economic loss every year. Previous work has revealed the viral factors that influence the virulence of influenza viruses. However, taking prior viral knowledge represented by heterogeneous categorical and discrete information into account is scarce in the existing work. How to make full use of the preceding domain knowledge into virulence study is challenging but beneficial. This paper proposes a general framework named ViPal for virulence prediction that incorporates discrete prior viral mutation and reassortment information based on all eight influenza segments. The posterior regularization technique is leveraged to transform prior viral knowledge to constraint features and integrated into the machine learning models. Experimental results on influenza genomic datasets validate that our proposed framework can improve virulence prediction performance over baselines. The comparison between ViPal and other existing methods shows the computational efficiency of our framework with superior performance. Moreover, the interpretable analysis through SHAP identifies the scores of constraint features contributing to the prediction. We hope this framework could provide assistance for the accurate detection of influenza virulence and facilitate flu surveillance.",

    "abstract": "At the genome level, microorganisms are highly adaptable both in terms of allele and gene composition. Such heritable traits emerge in response to different environmental niches and can have a profound influence on microbial community dynamics. As a consequence of this, any individual genome or clonal population will contain merely a fraction of the total genetic diversity of any operationally defined \"species\", with the collective from that group presenting the broader genomic diversity known as the pangenome. Pangenomes are valuable concepts for studying evolution and adaptation in microorganisms, as they partition genomes into core regions (present in all the genomes, and responsible for housekeeping and species-level niche adaptation) and accessory regions (present only in some genomes, and responsible for ecotype divergence).\n\nHere we present SuperPang, an algorithm capable of producing pangenome assemblies from a set of input genomes of varying quality, including metagenome-assembled genomes or MAGs. SuperPang runs in linear time and its results are complete, non-redundant, preserve gene ordering and contain both coding and non-coding regions. Our approach provides a modular view of the pangenome, identifying operons and genomic islands, and allowing to track their prevalence in different populations. We illustrate our approach by analyzing the intra-species diversity of Polynucleobacter, a clade of ubiquitous freshwater microorganisms characterized by their streamlined genomes and their ecological versatility. We show how SuperPang facilitates the simultaneous analysis of allelic and gene content variation under different environmental pressures, allowing us to study the drivers of microbial diversification at unprecedented resolution.",

    "abstract": "The miR-17~92a polycistron, also known as oncomiR-1, is commonly overexpressed in multiple cancers and has several oncogenic properties. OncomiR-1 encodes six constituent microRNAs (miRs), each enzymatically processed with different efficiencies. However, the structural mechanism that regulates this differential processing remains unclear. Chemical probing of oncomiR-1 revealed that the Drosha cleavage sites of pri-miR-92a are sequestered in a four-way junction. NPSL2, an independent stem loop element, is positioned just upstream of pri-miR-92a and sequesters a crucial part of the sequence that constitutes the basal helix of pri-miR-92a. Disruption of the NPSL2 hairpin structure could promote the formation of a pri-miR-92a structure that is primed for processing by Drosha. Thus, NPSL2 is predicted to function as a structural switch, regulating pri-miR-92a processing. Here, we determined the solution structure of NPSL2 using solution NMR spectroscopy. This is the first high-solution structure of an oncomiR-1 element. NPSL2 adopts a hairpin structure with a large, but highly structured, apical and internal loops. The 10-bp apical loop contains a pH-sensitive A+{middle dot}C mismatch. Additionally, several adenosines within the apical and internal loops have elevated pKa values. The protonation of these adenosines can stabilize the NPSL2 structure through electrostatic interactions. Our study provides fundamental insights into the secondary and tertiary structure of an important RNA hairpin proposed to regulate miR biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) reside in their tumor microenvironment (TME) niches, which are often hypoxic. Previously, we found that hypoxia and oxidative stress prevalent in TME may reprogram CSCs to a highly aggressive and inflammatory phenotype, the tumor stemness switch (TSS) phenotype. We previously reported a \"stem cell niche defense\" mechanism in bone marrow and lung mesenchymal stem cell niche against pathogen. Pathogen induced bystander apoptosis (PIBA) of stem cells harboring intracellular pathogen may be part of this defense mechanism. We speculate that the TSS phenotype may also activate this niche defense mechanism to defend their TME niche against pathogen and therefore could be exploited to target CSCs. Here we report that CSCs of TSS phenotype enriched in post-hypoxia ABCG2+ CSCs of several cell lines of diverse tumors including oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line SCC-25 exhibited bystander apoptosis when infected with either Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) or mutant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strain 18b. The conditioned media (CM) of the infected cells not only exhibited marked anti-tumor activity in vivo, but also showed significant anti-microbial activity. A detailed mechanisms study revealed that some of the infected ABCG2+ CSCs underwent pyroptosis and released a high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1)/p53 death signal that can induce a toll like receptor (TLR) 2/4 mediated bystander apoptosis. Thus, our findings suggest that PIBA can be utilized to activate the \"niche defense\" mechanism in TSS phenotype, which not only target the TSS, but also exhibit marked anti-tumor activity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The flurry of publications devoted to the functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) published in the last decade leaves no doubt about the exceptional importance of lncRNAs in various areas including tumor biology. Contribution of lncRNAs to the early stages of oncogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study we explored a new role for lncRNAs: stimulation of driver oncogenic mutations that result from specific chromosomal rearrangements. We demonstrated that lncRNA CASTL1 (ENSG00000269945) stimulates the formation of the CCDC6-RET inversion (RET/PTC1) in human thyroid cells subjected to radiation or chemical DNA damage. Facilitation of chromosomal rearrangement requires lncRNA to contain regions complementary to the introns of both CCDC6 and RET genes as deletion of these regions deprives CASTL1 of the ability to stimulate the gene fusion. We found that CASTL1 expression is elevated in tumors with CCDC6-RET fusion which is the most frequent rearrangement in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Our results open a new venue for the studies of early oncogenesis in various tumor types, especially those associated with physical or chemical DNA damage.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485761v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb217corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1936eeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58430forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ab5f8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) pose exceptional challenges with fatal brain metastases as a clear and unmet need. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are promising therapeutic strategies, but most TNBC are resistant, or \"cold\" tumors, due to lack of tumor-resident immune engagement. No FDA-approved therapies exist which promote a \"cold-to-hot\" transition or induce the important biomarker PD-L1, often used for ICI clinical decision-making. Maximal ICI susceptibility, or a full \"cold-to-hot\" transition, requires reciprocal Wnt signaling inhibition and Jak/STAT/interferon signaling activation. We report a new compound combination (CHA1) that fits the above criteria. CHA1 is comprised of EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate; green-tea compound) and decitabine (DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT1) inhibitor; 5deaza-cytidine; FDA-approved for hematologic malignancies). We used immune-compromised and syngeneic TNBC pre-clinical models to investigate tumor-intrinsic and tumor-resident T-cell effects, respectively. All results required CHA1 (but not EGCG or decitabine alone) and utilized attainable human dose equivalences with manageable safety profiles. CHA1 triggered efficient Wnt signaling inhibition by elevating Wnt pathway inhibitors (HBP1 and SFRP1) and traversed the blood-brain barrier to reduce both tumor and brain metastatic growth. Transcriptomic and expression analyses revealed that CHA1 treatment effectuated a robust tumor-intrinsic JAK/STAT/IFN response 1) to induce PDL1 and 2) to induce antigen presentation and processing genes, including MHC-1, MHC-2 and numerous genes attributed to professional antigen-presenting cells; 3) to induce CD8+-T-cell infiltration and activation. Additionally, CHA1 pre-treatment improved anti-PDL1 efficacy in a syngeneic setting. Lastly, we derived a composite gene signature emblematic of CHA1 treatment and of a favorable clinical prognosis in-silico. Together, our work supports a model in which CHA1 influences epigenetics, Wnt and Jak/STAT/IFN signaling mechanisms--all to reprogram an epithelial-mesenchymal TNBC tumor to express antigen-presenting properties and to recruit and activate tumor-resident CD8+-T-cells. We discuss our findings in the context of cancer biology and immunity with implications for improving ICI susceptibility for TNBC.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo resist lineage-dependent therapies such as androgen receptor inhibition in prostate cancer, cancer cells often adopt a stem-like state resulting in lineage-plasticity and phenotypic heterogeneity. We assessed the dynamics of lineage determination and cellular subpopulation expansion in treatment-resistant adenocarcinoma, amphicrine, and small cell neuroendocrine castrate resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs).\n\nExperimental DesignWe developed CRPC patient-derived organoid models that preserve heterogeneity of the originating tumor, including an amphicrine model harboring epigenetic driver mutations, ARID1A and ARID1B, and displaying a range of luminal and neuroendocrine phenotypes. We used single-cell RNA-seq, barcode lineage-tracing, single-cell ATAC-seq, and RNA-FISH to delineate the subpopulation structure of the heterogeneous organoids and define the lineage hierarchy, determine potential transcriptional regulators of amphicrine lineage-plasticity, and identify subpopulation-specific molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\nResultsTranscriptionally similar stem/progenitor cells were identified for all lineage populations. Lineage tracing in amphicrine CRPC showed that heterogeneity originated from distinct subclones of infrequent stem/progenitor cells that produced mainly quiescent differentiated amphicrine progeny. Amphicrine cells were enriched for secretory luminal, mesenchymal, and enzalutamide treatment persistent signatures. By contrast, adenocarcinoma CRPC had a less defined hierarchy, as progeny originated from stem/progenitor cells and self-renewing differentiated luminal cells. NEPC was composed almost exclusively of self-renewing stem/progenitor cells. Amphicrine stem cells demonstrated concurrent transcription factor activities associated with stem/progenitor, luminal epithelial and mesenchymal lineages. Finally, the amphicrine stem/progenitor subpopulation was specifically depleted with an AURKA inhibitor, which blocked tumor growth.\n\nConclusionsThese data illuminate distinct origins and dynamics of subtype-specific CRPC plasticity in addition to demonstrating a strategy for targeting differentiation-competent stem cells.\n\nTranslational RelevanceFor advanced prostate cancer, therapeutic resistance to androgen signaling suppression increasingly involves the development of lineage plasticity. The cellular states of transition and subpopulation heterogeneity that underlie lineage-plasticity are not well understood, which is an ongoing challenge to the design of effective treatments. Using patient-derived organoid models of various CRPC lineage subtypes, we observed distinct patterns with respect to stem/progenitor activity and associated growth phenotypes. The simultaneous expression of AR-driven and neuroendocrine identities, so-called amphicrine tumors, are thought to be an early dedifferentiation stage in plasticity-mediated resistance. We observed in an epigenetically-driven, amphicrine model of CRPC that a rare but necessary bipotent stem/progenitor population is suppressed by AURKA inhibitors, leading to tumor regression, while ARPC demonstrates both self-renewing differentiated luminal cells and stem/progenitors. These data suggest that AURKA inhibition may block the amplification of a resistance dedifferentiation pathway and should be considered in combination with AR signaling inhibitors for ARPC with characteristics of lineage plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The microstructure of the cuticle of several Agnostina species is described. For the first time, it has been shown that their cuticle consists of three layers: thick outer and transitional layers and a thin inner layer. The layers are made up of stacks of laminae: the laminae in the outer layer are thicker than in the transitional and inner ones. The evolution of the agnostoid cuticle proceeded, apparently, in the direction of decreasing the thickness of the inner layer which in contrast to all other arthropods, is thinner than the outer layer. Apparently, the inner layer was mineralized to a lesser extent than the outer one. In the structure of the cuticle, Agnostina are close to horseshoe crabs and trilobites. On the outer and inner layers, a set of sensilla was revealed; they can be attributed to trichoid, campaniform, and digitiform sensilla (with mechanoreceptor function) and celoconic sensilla (with chemoreceptor function). Also, unique sensorial ensembles were found on cephalons and pygidia; the function of the former is probably mechanosensorial, and the purpose of the latter cannot be assumed on this material.",

    "abstract": "Water-saving and drought-resistant rice (WDR) is a new type of rice varieties. It plays an important role in responding to drought with high yield and has been widely planted in central China at present. High photosynthetic production potential caused by high mesophyll conductance (gm) is the main factor promoted high yield formation in drought for WDR. But little is known about physiological and molecular mechanisms regulated gm in drought for WDR. Therefore, WDR cultivar HY73 and drought-sensitive cultivar HLY898 were used for comparative studies with three irrigation regimes before applying severe drought treatment at heading to create different differential individuals of photosynthetic potential and gm. The results showed that cultivar HY73 had lower up-regulation different expression genes (DEGs) than cultivar HLY898 in drought at transcriptional level. Conversely, DEGs of down-regulation was higher in cultivar HY73 than cultivar HLY898. In addition, 3071 DEGs were clustered in 3 modules named Midnightblue (734 DEGs), Blue (921 DEGs), and Turquoise (1416 DEGs) in severe drought merged three irrigation regimes and both cultivars, which the modules had significant correlational relationship with gm based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (P<0.05). Only DEGs in midnightblue module were enriched in photosynthesis process and positively regulated gm (P<0.05). The main biological process were photosynthesis (GO:0015979), light harvesting in photosystem I (GO:0009768), reductive pentose-phosphate cycle (GO:0019253), protein-chromophore linkage (GO:0018298), photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem I (GO:0009773), and photosystem II repair (GO:0010206). These results indicate that gm and energy distribution in PSI and PSII systems could synergistic effect photosynthetic production potential in severe drought for rice plants. In the modules, the 18 most highly connected hub genes were screened using co-expression networks method. RT-PCR analysis indicated that CSP41B, PGLP1A, LHCA5, and GSTU6 genes had a similar variation trend with gm among treatments for both cultivar. LHCA5 and CSP41B genes were significantly up-regulated in HY73 compared with HLY898 in drought (P<0.05). And the both genes locates in thylakoid membrane in photosystems. Therefore, LHCA5 and CSP41B genes could be key genes to synergistically manage gm and energy distribution in photosystems. Our results provide some new physiological and molecular mechanisms regulated gm in severe drought for WDR.",

    "abstract": "The pixels segmentation of high resolution RGB images into background, green vegetation and senescent vegetation classes is a first step often required before estimating key traits of interest including the vegetation fraction, the green area index, or to characterize the sanitary state of the crop. We developed the SegVeg model for semantic segmentation of RGB images into the three classes of interest. It is based on a U-net model that separates the vegetation from the background. It was trained over a very large and diverse dataset. The vegetation pixels are then classified using a SVM shallow machine learning technique trained over pixels extracted from grids applied to images. The performances of the SegVeg model are then compared to a three classes U-net model trained using weak supervision over RGB images with predicted pixels by SegVeg as groundtruth masks.\n\nResults show that the SegVeg model allows to segment accurately the three classes, with however some confusion mainly between the background and the senescent vegetation, particularly over the dark and bright parts of the images. The U-net model achieves similar performances, with some slight degradation observed for the green vegetation: the SVM pixel-based approach provides more precise delineation of the green and senescent patches as compared to the convolutional nature of U-net. The use of the components of several color spaces allows to better classify the vegetation pixels into green and senescent ones. Finally, the models are used to predict the fraction of the three classes over the grids pixels or the whole images. Results show that the green fraction is very well estimated (R2=0.94) by the SegVeg model, while the senescent and background fractions show slightly degraded performances (R2=0.70 and 0.73, respectively).\n\nWe made SegVeg publicly available as a ready-to-use script, as well as the entire dataset, rendering segmentation accessible to a broad audience by requiring neither manual annotation nor knowledge, or at least, offering a pre-trained model to more specific use.",

Plasma membrane-localized AtSWEET11 and AtSWEET12 transporters exclusively facilitate sucrose transport along the concentration gradient. This article examines the sucrose binding pocket of AtSWEET11 and AtSWEET12 using docking studies, and how they act synergistically in various functions throughout plant development and during abiotic and biotic stresses. Further, we highlight the phylogenetic and the in-silico analyses of AtSWEET11 and AtSWEET12 orthologs from 39 economically important plant species that could provide new platforms for future studies on sugar allocation mechanisms across the different plant families. In-depth understanding of these transporters and their molecular regulatory mechanisms could be harnessed for crop improvement and crop protection.",

    "abstract": "One of the more interesting ideas for achieving personalized, preventive, and participatory medicine is the concept of a digital twin. A digital twin is a personalized computer model of a patient. So far, digital twins have been constructed using either mechanistic models, which can simulate the trajectory of physiological and biochemical processes in a person, or using machine learning models, which for example can be used to estimate the risk of having a stroke given a cross-section profile at a given timepoint. These two modelling approaches have complementary strengths which can be combined into a hybrid model. However, even though hybrid modelling combining mechanistic modelling and machine learning have been proposed, there are few, if any, real examples of hybrid digital twins available. We now present such a hybrid model for the simulation of ischemic stroke. On the mechanistic side, we develop a new model for blood pressure and integrate this with an existing multi-level and multi-timescale model for the development of type 2 diabetes. This mechanistic model can simulate the evolution of known physiological risk factors (such as weight, diabetes development, and blood pressure) through time, under different intervention scenarios, involving a change in diet, exercise, and certain medications. These forecast trajectories of the physiological risk factors are then used by a machine learning model to calculate the 5-year risk of stroke, which thus also can be calculated for each timepoint in the simulated scenarios. We discuss and illustrate practical issues with clinical implementation, such as data gathering and harmonization. By improving patients understanding of their body and health, the digital twin can serve as a valuable tool for patient education and as a conversation aid during the clinical encounter. As such, it can facilitate shared decision-making, promote behavior change towards a healthy lifestyle, and improve adherence to prescribed medications.",

One solution is to compare studies after compound identification. However, compound identification is expensive and time consuming. We successfully identify common spectral features across multiple studies, with a generalizable experimental design approach. First, we included an anchor strain, PD1074, during sample and data collection. Second, we collected data in blocks with multiple controls. These anchors enabled us to successfully integrate three studies of Caenorhabditis elegans for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data from five different assays. We found 34% and 14% of features to be significant in LC-MS and NMR, respectively.

    "abstract": "Despite clear therapeutic potential, the mechanisms that confer differential neuronal sensitivity are not well understood. During Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), sensitive spinal motor neurons (SpMN) die while a subset of rostral cranial motor neurons (CrMN) survive. In this work, we optimized a protocol to differentiate CrMNs and SpMNs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by direct programming and positional patterning. Human iCrMNs are more resistant than iSpMNs to proteotoxic stress and rely on the proteasome to maintain proteostasis. iCrMNs better prevent mislocalization of TDP43 from the nucleus, a hallmark of ALS progression. iSpMNs contain more splicing defects than iCrMNs in response to ALS-related stress with genes involved in splicing and proteostasis maintenance. Therefore, iCrMNs resist ALS at two levels, preventing protein accumulation and reducing splicing defects in response to TDP43 nuclear depletion. Thus, ALS-sensitive iSpMNs appear to enter a downward spiral compromising their ability to maintain proteostasis and splicing.",

To address this question, we functionally mapped the spatial organization of the input axons and target neurons in the mouse retinocollicular pathway at single-cell resolution using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. We found a near-perfect retinotopic tiling of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals, with an average error below 30 m or 2 degrees of visual angle. The precision of retinotopy was relatively lower for local neurons in the superior colliculus. Subsequent data-driven modelling ascribed it to a low input convergence, on average 5.5 retinal ganglion cell inputs to a postsynaptic cell in the superior colliculus. These results indicate that retinotopy arises largely from topographically precise input from presynaptic cells, rather than elaborating local circuitry to reconstruct the topography by postsynaptic cells.",

Whilst we have advanced recording systems with over 4000 electrodes, capable of recording data at over 20 kHz, it still presents computational challenges to handle, process, extract, and view information from these large recordings. It can be challenging for researchers to extract and view even a single channel that has more than a billion data points, let alone process a group of channels.\n\nWe have created a computational method, and an open-source toolkit built on Python, rendered on a web browser using Plotlys Dash for extracting and viewing the data, and creating interactive visualization. In addition to extracting and viewing entire or small chunks of data sampled at lower or higher frequencies, respectively, it provides a framework to collect user inputs, analyze channel groups, generate raster plots, view quick summary measures for LFP activity, detect and isolate noise channels, and generate plots and visualization in both time and frequency domain. Incorporated into our Graphical User Interface (GUI), we also have created a novel seizure detection method, which can be used to detect the onset of seizures in all or a selected group of channels and provide the following measures of seizures: distance, duration, and propagation across the region of interest.\n\nWe demonstrate the utility of this toolkit, using datasets collected from the 3Brain BioCAM duplex system. For the current analysis, we demonstrate the toolkit and methods with a low sampling frequency dataset (300 Hz) and a group of approximately 400 channels. Using this toolkit, we present novel data demonstrating increased seizure propagation speed from slices of Scn1aHet mice compared to littermate controls.\n\nWith advances in HD-MEA recording systems with high spatial and temporal resolution, limited tools are available for researchers to view and process these big datasets. We now provide a user-friendly toolkit to analyze LFP activity obtained from large-scale MEA recordings with translatable applications to EEG recordings, and demonstrate the utility of this new graphic user interface with novel biological findings.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human spinal cord (SC) is a unique non-invasive method for characterizing neurovascular responses to stimuli. Group-analysis of SC fMRI data involves co-registration of subject-level data to standard space, which requires manual masking of the cord and may result in bias of group-level SC fMRI results. To test this, we examined variability in SC masks drawn in fMRI data from 21 healthy participants from a completed study mapping responses to sensory stimuli of the C7 dermatome. Masks were drawn on temporal mean functional image by eight raters with varying levels of neuroimaging experience, and the rater from the original study acted as a reference. Spatial agreement between rater and reference masks was measured using the Dice Similarity Coefficient, and the influence of rater and dataset was examined using ANOVA. Each raters masks were used to register functional data to the PAM50 template. Gray matter-white matter signal contrast of registered functional data was used to evaluate the spatial normalization accuracy across raters. Subject- and group-level analyses of activation during left- and right-sided sensory stimuli were performed for each raters co-registered data. Agreement with the reference SC mask was associated with both rater (F(7,140) = 32.12, P < 2x10-16,{eta} 2 = 0.29) and dataset (F(20,140) = 20.58, P < 2x10-16,{eta} 2 = 0.53). Dataset variations may reflect image quality metrics: the ratio between the signal intensity of spinal cord voxels and surrounding cerebrospinal fluid was correlated with DSC results (p<0.001). As predicted, variability in the manually-drawn masks influenced spatial normalization, and GM:WM contrast in the registered data showed significant effects of rater and dataset (rater: F(8,160) = 23.57, P < 2x10-16,{eta} 2 = 0.24; dataset: F(20,160) = 22.00, P < 2x10-16,{eta} 2 = 0.56). Registration differences propagated into subject-level activation maps which showed rater-dependent agreement with the reference. Although group-level activation maps differed between raters, no systematic bias was identified. Increasing consistency in manual contouring of spinal cord fMRI data improved co-registration and inter-rater agreement in activation mapping, however our results suggest that improvements in image acquisition and post-processing are also critical to address.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. AD is more prevalent in females than males. While estrogen provides neuroprotection in females, sex mediated differences in the development of AD pathology are not fully elucidated. Therefore, a comparison of the events that develop between sexes in the early-stage of AD pathology may reveal new potential targets for more effective therapeutic intervention. To address sex differences, we analyzed early stage 9-month male and female TgF344-AD (Tg-AD) rats, an AD model carrying the APPswe and Presenilin 1 (PS1{Delta}E9) mutations that develops progressive age-dependent AD pathology similar to humans. Using active place avoidance (aPAT) tests that assess hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, we found significant deficits in Tg-AD females compared to wild type females, but no significant difference between the two male genotypes. Moreover, significant sex differences were observed in that Tg-AD females outperformed Tg-AD males in several measures of the aPAT test. Unexpectedly, Tg-AD females displayed higher levels of hippocampal amyloid plaques and amoeboid microglia than their Tg-AD male littermates. Furthermore, Tg-AD females experienced less hippocampal neuronal loss and had higher GluA2 subunit levels than Tg-AD males. Based on our findings, we propose that estrogen may protect females against cognitive impairment at early stages of AD by regulating GluA2 levels independently of amyloid plaque deposition and gliosis. Elucidating this potential protective mechanism of action of estrogen in AD could lead to new targets for early intervention.",

    "abstract": "As the sister group to bilaterians, cnidarians stand in a unique phylogenetic position that provides insight into evolutionary aspects of animal development, physiology, and behavior. While cnidarians are classified into two types, sessile polyps and free-swimming medusae, most studies at the cellular and molecular levels have been conducted on representative polyp-type cnidarians and have focused on establishing techniques of genetic manipulation. Recently, gene knockdown by delivery of short hairpin RNAs into eggs via electroporation has been introduced in two polyp-type cnidarians, Nematostella vectensis and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, enabling systematic loss-of-function experiments. By contrast, current methods of genetic manipulation for most medusa-type cnidarians, or jellyfish, are quite limited, except for Clytia hemisphaerica, and reliable techniques are required to interrogate function of specific genes in different jellyfish species. Here, we present a method to knock down target genes by delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) into fertilized eggs via electroporation, using the hydrozoan jellyfish, Clytia hemisphaerica and Cladonema paciificum. We show that siRNAs targeting endogenous GFP1 and Wnt3 in Clytia efficiently knock down gene expression and result in known planula phenotypes: loss of green fluorescence and defects in axial patterning, respectively. We also successfully knock down endogenous Wnt3 in Cladonema by siRNA electroporation, which circumvents the technical difficulty of microinjecting small eggs. Wnt3 knockdown in Cladonema causes gene expression changes in axial markers, suggesting a conserved Wnt/{beta}-catenin-mediated pathway that controls axial polarity during embryogenesis. Our gene-targeting siRNA electroporation method is applicable to other animals, including and beyond jellyfish species, and will facilitate the investigation and understanding of myriad aspects of animal development.",

    "abstract": "Heart development begins with the formation of a tube, as cardiac progenitors migrate from opposite sides of the embryo and meet medially. Defective cardiac progenitor movements cause congenital heart defects. However, the mechanisms of cell migration during early heart development remain poorly understood. We investigated the mechanisms of movement of the Drosophila cardiac progenitors, the cardioblasts. Using quantitative time-lapse microscopy, we found that cardioblasts did not advance monotonically. Instead, cardioblasts took periodic forward and backward steps as they migrated. The forward steps were greater in both amplitude and duration, resulting in net forward movement of the cells. The molecular motor non-muscle myosin II displayed an alternating pattern of localization between the leading and trailing ends of migrating cardioblasts, forming oscillatory waves that traversed the cells. The alternating pattern of myosin polarity was associated with the alternative contraction and relaxation of the leading and trailing edges of the cell. Mathematical modelling predicted that forward migration requires the presence of a stiff boundary at the trailing edge of the cardioblasts. Consistent with this, we found a supracellular actin cable at the trailing edge of the cardioblasts. When we reduced the tension sustained by the actin cable, the amplitude of the backward steps of cardioblasts increased, thus reducing the net forward speed of migration. Together, our results indicate that periodic cell shape changes coupled with a polarized actin cable produce asymmetrical forces that guide cardioblast migration.",

However, which strategies to generate pseudo-absences give rise to faithful SDMs in complex mountainous terrain, and whether species-specific or generic strategies perform better remain open questions.\nC_LIO_LIHere, across 500 plant species, we investigated comprehensively how predictions of SDMs at a 93 m spatial resolution are influenced by pseudo-absence strategies, using the complex topography of the Swiss mountains as a model system. We used five generic (random, equal-stratified, proportional-stratified, target, density) and three species-specific (target specific, density specific and geographic specific) approaches to derive pseudo-absence data. We conducted performance tests for each of our eight strategies in combination with (a) spatial bias, generated within our occurrence dataset on sites with highest sampling density, to investigate how this common bias problem influences the performance of pseudo-absence sampling strategies, and (b) a new approach to reduce model extrapolation in environmental space by including background data from all environmental conditions of the study area. SDMs were evaluated against an independent and well-sampled dataset of true presences and absences.\nC_LIO_LIThe random, the density (generic), and the geographic specific (species-specific) strategies consistently performed best, even in cases of strong spatial sampling bias in the occurrence data. Including a background of environmentally stratified pseudo-absences improved predictions of species distributions towards environmental extremes, and significantly reduced spatial extrapolations of model predictions in environmental space.\nC_LIO_LIOur results indicate that both generic and species-specific pseudo-absence strategies allow estimating robust SDMs and we provide clear recommendations which strategies to choose in complex terrain and when presence data are prone to high sampling bias. In datasets with strong sampling bias, most pseudo-absence strategies produce extrapolation problems and we additionally recommend environmentally stratified pseudo-absences in these cases. Overall, in species rich datasets the use of complex and computationally demanding, species-specific pseudo-absence strategies may not always be justified compared to simpler generic approaches.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Some fungi have been domesticated for food production, with genetic differentiation between populations from food and wild environments, and food populations often acquiring beneficial traits through horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). Studying their adaptation to human-made substrates are of fundamental and applied importance, for understanding adaptation processes and for further strain improvement. We studied here the population structures and phenotypes of two distantly related Penicillium species used for dry-cured meat production, P. nalgiovense, the most common species in the dry-cured meat food industry, and P. salamii, used locally by farms. Both species displayed low genetic diversity, lacking differentiation between strains isolated from dry-cured meat and those from other environments. Nevertheless, the strains collected from dry-cured meat within each species displayed slower proteolysis and lipolysis than their wild conspecifics, and those of P. nalgiovense were whiter. Phenotypically, the non-dry-cured meat strains were more similar to their sister species than to their conspecific dry-cured meat strains, indicating an evolution of specific phenotypes in dry-cured meat strains. A comparison of available Penicillium genomes from various environments revealed HGTs, particularly between P. nalgiovense and P. salamii (representing almost 1.5 Mb of cumulative length). HGTs additionally involved P. biforme, also found in dry-cured meat products. We further detected positive selection based on amino-acid changes. Our findings suggest that selection by humans has shaped the P. salamii and P. nalgiovense populations used for dry-cured meat production, which constitutes domestication. Several genetic and phenotypic changes were similar in P. salamii, P. nalgiovense, and P. biforme, indicating convergent adaptation to the same human-made environment. Our findings have implications for fundamental knowledge on adaptation and for the food industry: the discovery of different phenotypes and of two mating types paves the way for strain improvement by conventional breeding, to elucidate the genomic bases of beneficial phenotypes and to generate diversity.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC1 activity is positively regulated by the presence of amino acids and glucose in the medium. However, mechanisms underlying nutrient-induced TORC1 activation remain poorly understood. By utilizing a TORC1 activation assay, we demonstrate that differential metabolism of glucose activates TORC1 through three distinct pathways in yeast. The first  canonical Rag GTPase-dependent pathway requires conversion of glucose to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate which activates TORC1 via the Rag GTPase heterodimer Gtr1GTP/Gtr2GDP. The second  non-canonical Rag GTPase-dependent pathway requires conversion of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate which activates TORC1 via Gtr1GTP/Gtr2GTP. The third  Rag GTPase-independent pathway requires complete glycolysis and vacuolar ATPase reassembly for TORC1 activation. Glucose-induced TORC1 activation can be uncoupled from glucose-induced AMPK inactivation. We have established a roadmap to deconstruct the link between glucose metabolism and TORC1 activation.",

ME variants (MEVs) are difficult to genotype, obscuring their impact on recent genome and trait diversification. We developed a tool that uses short-read sequence data to accurately genotype MEVs, enabling us to study them using statistical genetics methods in global human genomes. We observe population-specific differences in the distribution of Alu insertions that distinguish Japanese from other populations. We integrated MEVs with epigenomic and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) maps to determine how they impact traits. This reveals coherent patterns by which specific MEs regulate tissue-specific gene expression, including creating or attenuating enhancers and recruiting post-transcriptional regulators. We pinpoint MEVs as genetic causes of disease risk, including a LINE-1 insertion linked to keloid and other diseases of fibroblast inflammation, by introducing MEVs into the genome-wide association study (GWAS) framework. In addition to nominating previously-hidden MEVs as causes of human diseases, this work highlights MEs as accelerators of human population divergence and begins to decipher the semantics of MEs.",

Microfluidic chips offer potential to address both of these issues. However, few solutions offer both control over onset and duration of cell-cell communication, and high throughput. We have developed a microfluidic chip designed to culture cells in adjacent chambers, separated by valves to selectively allow or prevent exchange of paracrine signals. The chip features 16 fluidic inputs and 128 individuallyaddressable chambers arranged in 32 sets of 4 chambers. Media can be continuously perfused or delivered by diffusion, which we model under different culture conditions to ensure normal cell viability. Immunocytochemistry assays can be performed in the chip, which we modeled and fine-tuned to reduce total assay time to 1h. Finally, we validate the use of the chip for co-culture studies by showing that HEK293Ta cells respond to signals secreted by RAW 264.7 immune cells in adjacent chambers, only when the valve between the chambers is opened.",

Recently, exitron splicing has been shown to increase proteome plasticity and play a role in cancer. Long-read RNA-seq is well suited for quantification and discovery of alternative splicing events; however, there are currently no tools available for detection and annotation of exitrons in long-read RNA-seq data. Here we present ScanExitronLR, an application for the characterization and quantification of exitron splicing events in long-reads. From a BAM alignment file, reference genome and reference gene annotation, ScanExitronLR outputs exitron events at the transcript level. Outputs of ScanExitronLR can be used in downstream analyses of differential exitron splicing. A companion tool, AnnotateExitron, reports exitron annotations such as truncation or frameshift type, nonsense-mediated decay status, and Pfam domain interruptions. We demonstrate that ScanExitronLR performs better on noisy long-reads than currently published exitron detection algorithms designed for short-read data.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationScanExitronLR is freely available at https://github.com/ylab-hi/ScanExitronLR and distributed as a pip package on the Python Package Index.\n\nContactyang4414@umn.edu\n\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "PurposeNon-T cell-inflamed immunologically \"cold\" tumor microenvironments (TME) are associated with poor responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and can be sculpted by tumor cell genomics. Here we evaluated how Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor loss of function (LOF), one of the most frequent alterations in human cancer and associated with lineage plasticity, poor prognosis and therapeutic outcomes, alters the TME, and whether therapeutic strategies targeting the molecular consequences of Rb loss enhance ICB efficacy.\n\nExperimental DesignWe performed bioinformatics analysis to elucidate the impact of endogenous Rb LOF on the immune TME in human primary and metastatic tumors. Next, we utilized isogenic murine models of Rb-deficient prostate cancer (PC) for in vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies to examine how Rb loss and bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) domain inhibition (BETi) reprograms the immune landscape, and evaluated in vivo therapeutic efficacy of BETi, singly and in combination with ICB and androgen deprivation therapy.\n\nResultsRb loss was enriched in non-T cell-inflamed tumors, and Rb-deficient murine tumors demonstrated decreased immune infiltration in vivo. The BETi JQ1 increased immune infiltration into the TME through enhanced tumor cell STING/NF-{kappa}B activation and type I interferon (IFN) signaling within tumor cells, resulting in differential macrophage and T cell-mediated tumor growth inhibition and sensitization of Rb-deficient PC to ICB.\n\nConclusionsBETi can reprogram the immunologically cold Rb-deficient TME via STING/NF-{kappa}B/IFN signaling to sensitize Rb-deficient PC to ICB. These data provide the mechanistic rationale to test combinations of BETi and ICB in clinical trials of Rb-deficient PC.\n\nSTATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCERb LOF is one of the most common genomic alterations in human cancer, occurring in approximately 1/3 of advanced malignancies, Furthermore, loss of Rb correlates with enhanced aggressiveness and poor therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of Rb is also associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and lack of responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). As a strategy to overcome Rb LOF induced immunosuppression, we have demonstrated that BETi treatment drives STING/NF-{kappa}B signaling and type I interferon production within tumor cells, resulting in immune-mediated tumor control in Rb-deficient PC, which is accentuated by the combination with ICB and ADT. These findings provide a roadmap for maximizing the clinical translation of BET inhibitors into the clinic to treat aggressive-variant Rb-deficient PC.",

Here, we employed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the cellular microenvironment of healthy and chronically injured pre-malignant livers using two distinct mouse models. Analysis of 40,748 hepatic nuclei unraveled a previously uncharacterized disease-associated hepatocyte transcriptional state (daHep). These cells were absent in healthy livers, but were increasingly prevalent as chronic liver disease progressed towards hepatocarcinogenesis. Gene expression deconvolution of 1,439 human liver transcriptomes from publicly available datasets revealed that daHep frequencies highly correlate with current histopathological liver disease staging systems. Importantly, we show that high daHep levels precede carcinogenesis in mice and humans and predict a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development.

    "abstract": "There is growing concern about infectious diseases in wildlife species caused by pathogenic fungi. Detailed knowledge exists about host pathology and the molecular mechanisms underlying host physiological response to some fungal diseases affecting amphibians and bats but is lacking for others with potentially significant impacts on large groups of animals. One such disease is ophidiomycosis (Snake Fungal Disease; SFD) which is caused by the fungus Ophidiomyces ophidiicola and impacts diverse species of snakes. Despite this potential, the biological mechanisms and molecular changes occurring during infection are unknown for any snake species. To gain this information, we performed a controlled experimental infection of captive Prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis) with O. ophidiicola at different temperatures. We then generated liver, kidney, and skin transcriptomes from control and infected snakes to assess tissue specific genetic responses to infection. Given previous SFD histopathological studies and the fact that snakes are ectotherms, we expected highest fungal activity on skin and a significant impact of temperature on host response. In contrast, we found that most of the differential gene expression was restricted to internal tissues and fungal-infected snakes showed transcriptome profiles indicative of long-term inflammation of specific tissues. Infected snakes at the lower temperature had the most pronounced overall host functional response whereas, infected snakes at the higher temperature had overall expression profiles similar to control snakes possibly indicating recovery from the disease. Overall, our results suggest SFD is a systemic disease with a chronic host response, unlike acute response shown by amphibians to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infections. Our analysis also generated a list of candidate protein coding genes that potentially mediate SFD response in snakes, providing tools for future comparative and evolutionary studies into variable species susceptibility to ophidiomycosis.\n\nAuthor summaryOphidiomycosis (Snake Fungal Disease; SFD) is an infectious fungal disease in snakes that has been documented in more than 40 species over the past 20 years. Though many snake species seem vulnerable to SFD, little is known about how snake physiology changes in response to infection with the causative fungus, Ophidiomyces ophidiicola. Here we report results from the first experimental transcriptomic study of SFD in a snake host. Our goals were to identify genes with a putative role in host response, use this information to understand what biological changes occur in different tissues in snakes when infected with O. ophidiicola, and determine if temperature has an impact in these ectothermic animals. We conclude that SFD is a systemic disease with a chronic inflammation leading to deterioration of internal organs and that these physiological impacts are more pronounced at low rather than high temperatures. These results contrast with fungal infections in amphibians where hosts show an acute response mostly restricted to skin. Our list of candidate genes carry utility in potentially diagnosing genetic susceptibility to SFD in snake species of conservation concern.",

    "abstract": "As multicellular organisms, plants constantly balance and coordinate many metabolic, physiological, and molecular responses between different cell types and tissues. This process is essential for plant development, growth, and response to different environmental cues. Because plants lack a nervous system, they transmit different signals over long distances via cell-to-cell signaling. Recent studies revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced by respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs) at the apoplast play a key role in cell-to-cell signaling. A state of enhanced ROS production by one cell is thereby sensed by a neighboring cell, causing it to produce ROS, creating a continuous chain of cell-to-cell ROS accumulation termed the  ROS wave. This process was found to mediate systemic signals throughout the plant and is required for plant acclimation to different stresses. Although RBOHs were found to produce ROS essential for this process, the identity of the receptor(s) perceiving the apoplastic ROS signal is currently unknow. Here we reveal that the leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase HPCA1 (H2O2-induced Ca2+ increases 1) acts as a central ROS receptor required for the propagation of cell-to-cell ROS signals, systemic signaling in response to different biotic and abiotic stresses, and plant acclimation to stress. We further report that HPCA1 is required for systemic calcium signals, but not systemic membrane depolarization responses, and identify key calcium-dependent signal transduction proteins involved in this process. Our findings reveal that HPCA1 plays a key role in mediating and coordinating systemic cell-to-cell ROS and calcium signals that are required for plant acclimation to stress.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of neural circuits from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) images is being accelerated by automatic image segmentation methods. Segmentation accuracy is often limited by the preceding step of aligning 2D section images to create a 3D image stack. Precise and robust alignment in the presence of image artifacts is challenging, especially as datasets are attaining the petascale. We present a computational pipeline for aligning ssEM images with several key elements. Self-supervised convolutional nets are trained via metric learning to encode and align image pairs, and they are used to initialize iterative fine-tuning of alignment. A procedure called vector voting increases robustness to image artifacts or missing image data. For speedup the series is divided into blocks that are distributed to computational workers for alignment. The blocks are aligned to each other by composing transformations with decay, which achieves a global alignment without resorting to a time-consuming global optimization. We apply our pipeline to a whole fly brain dataset, and show improved accuracy relative to prior state of the art. We also demonstrate that our pipeline scales to a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex. Our pipeline is publicly available through two open source Python packages.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor neuron dysfunction and loss. A portion of ALS is caused by mutation of the proteasome shuttle factor Ubiquilin 2 (UBQLN2), but the molecular pathway leading from UBQLN2 dysfunction to disease remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a function of UBQLN2 in regulating activity of the domesticated gag-pol retrotransposon  paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) in human cells and tissues. In cells, the PEG10 gag-pol protein cleaves itself in a mechanism reminiscent of retrotransposon self-processing to generate a liberated  nucleocapsid fragment, which uniquely localizes to the nucleus and changes expression of genes involved in axon remodeling. In spinal cord tissue from ALS patients, PEG10 gag-pol is elevated compared to healthy controls. These findings implicate the retrotransposon-like activity of PEG10 as a contributing mechanism in ALS through regulation of gene expression, and restraint of PEG10 as a primary function of UBQLN2.",

Following the discovery of an unexpectedly high prevalence of EET genes in a bog lakes bacterioplankton, we hypothesized that the redox capacities of dissolved organic matter (DOM) enrich for electroactive bacteria by mediating redox chemistry. We developed the bioinformatics pipeline FEET (Find EET) to identify and summarize EET proteins from metagenomics data. We then applied FEET to several bog and thermokarst lakes and correlated EET protein occurrence values with environmental data to test our predictions. Our results provide evidence that DOM participates in EET by bacterioplankton. We found a similarly high prevalence of EET genes in most of these lakes, where oxidative EET strongly correlated with DOM. Numerous novel clusters of multiheme cytochromes that may enable EET were identified. Taxa previously not considered EET-capable were found to carry EET genes. We conclude that EET and DOM interactions are of major ecological importance to bacterioplankton in small boreal lakes, and that EET, particularly by methylotrophs and phototrophs, should be further studied and incorporated into both conceptual and quantitative methane emission models of melting permafrost.",

As many human coronaviruses are known to be sensitive to IFN, antiviral roles of IRFs are yet to be fully understood. TypeI or II IFN treatment protected MRC5 cells from infection of human coronavirus 229E, but not human coronavirus OC43. Infection of 229E or OC43 efficiently upregulated ISGs, indicating that antiviral transcription is not suppressed during their infection. Antiviral IRFs, IRF1, IRF3 and IRF7, were activated in cells infected with 229E, OC43 or severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RNAi knockdown and overexpression of the IRFs demonstrated that IRF1 and IRF3 have antiviral property against OC43 while only IRF3 and IRF7 are effective to restrict 229E infection. Our study demonstrates that IRF3 plays critical roles against infection of human coronavirus 229E and OC43, which may be an anti-human coronavirus therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 encodes for a small 75 amino acid transmembrane protein known as the envelope (E) protein. The E protein forms an ion channel, like the viroporins from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Vpu) and influenza A virus (M2). Here, we analyzed HIV-1 virus infectivity in the presence of four different {beta}-coronavirus E proteins. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV E proteins reduced HIV-1 yields by approximately 100-fold while MERS-CoV or HCoV-OC43 E proteins restricted HIV-1 infectivity to a lesser extent. This was also reflected in the levels of HIV-1 protein synthesis in cells. Mechanistically, we show that that the E protein neither affected reverse transcription nor genome integration. However, SARS-CoV-2 E protein activated the ER-stress pathway associated with the phosphorylation of eIF-2, which is known to attenuate protein synthesis in cells. Finally, we show that these four E proteins and the SARS-CoV-2 N protein did not significantly down-regulate bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2) while the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and HIV-1 Vpu efficiently down-regulated cell surface BST-2 expression. The results of this study show for the first time that viroporins from a heterologous virus can suppress HIV-1 infection.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe E protein of coronaviruses is a viroporin that is required for efficient release of infectious virus and for viral pathogenicity. We determined if the E protein from four {beta}-coronaviruses could restrict virus particle infectivity of HIV-1 infection. Our results indicate that the E proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV potently restricted HIV-1 while those from MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 were less restrictive. Substitution of the highly conserved proline in the cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV-2 E abrogated the restriction on HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 E protein did not interfere with viral integration or RNA synthesis but rather reduced viral protein synthesis. We show that the E protein-initiated ER stress causing phosphorylation of eIF-2, which is known to attenuate protein synthesis. Companion studies suggest that the E protein also triggers autophagy. These results show for the first time that a viroporin from a coronavirus can restrict infection of another virus.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemia that conducted in 6 million deaths worldwide so far. SARS-CoV-2 particles are mainly composed of the 4 main structural proteins M, N, E and S to form 100nm diameter viral particles. Based on productive assays, we propose an optimal transfected plasmid ratio mimicking the virus RNA ratio allowing SARS-CoV-2 Virus-Like Particle (VLPs) formation composed of the viral structural proteins M, N, E and S. Furthermore, monochrome, dual-color fluorescent or photoconvertible VLPs were produced. Thanks to live fluorescence and super-resolution microscopy, we quantified VLPs size and concentration. It shows a diameter of 110 and 140 nm respectively for MNE-VLPs and MNES-VLPs with a minimum concentration of 10e12 VLP/ml. SARS-CoV-2 VLPs could tolerate the integration of fluorescent N and M tagged proteins without impairing particle assembly. In this condition, we were able to establish incorporation of the mature Spike in fluorescent VLPs. The Spike functionality was then shown by monitoring fluorescent MNES-VLPs docking and endocytosis in human pulmonary cells expressing the receptor hACE2. This work provides new insights on the use of non-fluorescent and fluorescent VLPs to study and visualize the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle in a safe environment (BSL-2 instead of BSL-3). Moreover, optimized SARS-CoV-2 VLP production can be further adapted to vaccine design strategies.",

    "abstract": "Human rotavirus (RV) vaccines used worldwide have been developed using live attenuated platforms. The recent development of a reverse genetics system for RVs has delivered the possibility of engineering chimeric viruses expressing heterologous peptides from other virus species to generate polyvalent vaccines. We tested the feasibility of this using two approaches. Firstly, we inserted short SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides into the hypervariable region of the simian SA11 RV strain viral protein (VP) 4. Secondly, we fused the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or the shorter receptor binding motif (RBM) nested within the RBD, to the C-terminus of non-structural protein (NSP) 3 of the bovine RF strain RV, with or without an intervening T2A peptide. Mutating the hypervariable region of SA11 VP4 impeded viral replication, and for these mutants no cross-reactivity with spike antibodies was detected. To rescue NSP3 mutants, we established a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for the bovine RF strain. Except for the RBD mutant, all NSP3 mutants delivered endpoint titres and replication kinetics comparable to that of the WT virus. In ELISAs, cell lysates of an NSP3 mutant expressing the RBD peptide showed cross reactivity with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody. 3D bovine gut enteroids were susceptible to infection by all NSP3 mutants but only RBM mutant showed cross reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody. The tolerability of large peptide insertions in the NSP3 segment highlights the potential for this approach in the development of vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe explored the use of rotaviruses (RVs) to express heterologous peptides, using SARS-CoV-2 as an exemplar. Small SARS-CoV-2 peptide insertion (<34 amino acids) into the hypervariable region of the viral protein 4 (VP4) of RV SA11 strain resulted in reduced viral titre and replication, thus limiting its use as a potential vaccine expression platform. To test RF strain for its tolerance for peptide insertions, we constructed a reverse genetics system. NSP3 was C-terminally tagged with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides of up to 193 amino acids. With a T2A-separated 193 amino acid tag on NSP3, there was little effect on the viral rescue efficiency, titre and replication. Tagged NSP3 elicited cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in ELISA. This is the first report describing epitope tagging of VP4, and of a reverse genetics system for the RF strain. We highlight the potential for development of RV vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously.",

Here, we used immunoprecipitation followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins that associate with the L1 ORF1-encoded protein (ORF1p) in ribonucleoprotein particles. Three ISG proteins that interact with ORF1p inhibit retrotransposition: HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 5 (HERC5); 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL); and helicase with zinc finger 2 (HELZ2). HERC5 destabilizes ORF1p, but does not affect its cellular localization. OASL impairs ORF1p cytoplasmic foci formation. HELZ2 recognizes sequences and/or structures within the L1 5UTR to reduce L1 RNA, ORF1p, and ORF1p cytoplasmic foci levels. Overexpression of WT or reverse transcriptase-deficient L1s led to a modest induction of IFN- expression, which was abrogated upon HELZ2 overexpression. Notably, IFN- expression was enhanced upon overexpression of an ORF1p RNA binding mutant, suggesting ORF1p binding might protect L1 RNA from \"triggering\" IFN- induction. Thus, ISG proteins can inhibit retrotransposition by different mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The ability of human encoded soluble proteins to convert into amyloid fibrils is now recognized as a generic phenomenon in several human illnesses. Typically, such disease causal proteins/peptides consist of aggregation-prone regions (APR) that make them susceptible to misfolding and assemble into highly ordered {beta}-sheet rich fibrils, distinct from their native soluble state. Here, we show that the zika virus (ZIKV) consists of several such aggregation prone hotspots spread across its entire proteome. Using a combination of high-accuracy prediction tools, we identified APRs in both structural and non-structural proteins of ZIKV. Furthermore, we have experimentally validated the bioinformatic results by subjecting the ZIKV proteins and peptides to artificial aggregation inducing environment. Using a combination of dye-based assays (ThT and ANS) and microscopy techniques (HR-TEM and AFM), we further characterized the morphological features of amyloid-like fibrils. We found that Envelope domain III (EDIII) protein, NS1 {beta}-roll peptide, membrane-embedded signal peptide 2K, and cytosolic region of NS4B protein to be highly aggregating in the experimental setup. Our findings also pave the way for an extensive and detailed functional analysis of these predicted APRs in the future to enhance our understanding of the role played by amyloids in the pathogenesis of flavivirus.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485915v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bedf4dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@364676org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14bf54aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4fc19_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (referred to as Chlamydomonas throughout) is an ideal model organism which possesses both plant and animal attribute for studying the fundamental processes such as photosynthesis, sexual reproduction and life cycle etc. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA modification and plays important roles during sexual reproduction in animals and plants. However, the pattern and function of m6A modification during Chlamydomonas sexual reproduction is still unknown. Here, we performed transcriptome and MeRIP sequencing on the six samples from different stages during sexual reproduction of Chlamydomonas life cycle. The results showed that m6A occurs widely at the main motif of UGKAM (K= U/G, M= A/C) in Chlamydomonas mRNA. Moreover, m6A peak in Chlamydomonas mRNA is mainly enriched in the 3UTR region and negatively correlated with the abundance of the transcripts at each stage. Especially, genes in microtubule-associated pathway showed a significant negative correlation between gene expression level and m6A level, indicating the influences of m6A modification on sexual reproduction and life cycle of Chlamydomonas through regulating microtubule-based movement. In summary, our findings first demonstrate the distributions and the functions of m6A modification in Chlamydomonas and provide new insights into the understandings of m6A modification in the process of sexual reproduction in other plant organisms evolutionarily.",

    "abstract": "Ascochyta blight (AB) caused by a filamentous fungus Ascochyta rabiei is a major threat to global chickpea production. The mechanisms underlying chickpea response to A. rabiei remain elusive. Here, we investigated the comparative transcriptional dynamics of AB-resistant and susceptible chickpea genotypes upon A. rabiei infection to understand the early host defence response. Our findings revealed that AB-resistant plants underwent rapid and extensive transcriptional reprogramming compared to susceptible host. At early stage (24-hpi), mainly cell wall remodeling and secondary metabolite pathways were highly activated, while DEGs related with signaling components viz. protein kinases, transcription factors, and hormonal pathways show remarkable upsurge at 72-hpi, especially in resistant genotype. Notably, our data suggests imperative role of JA, ET, and ABA signaling in providing immunity against A. rabiei. Furthermore, gene co-expression networks and modules corroborated the importance of cell wall remodeling, signal transduction and phytohormone pathways. The hub genes such as MYB14, PRE6 and MADS-SOC1 discovered in these modules might be the master regulators governing chickpea immunity. Overall, we not only provide novel insights for comprehensive understanding of immune signaling components mediating AB resistance/susceptibility at early Cicer-Ascochyta interactions, but also offer a valuable resource for developing AB-resistant chickpea.\n\nHighlightsComparative transcriptomic and co-expression analysis of AB-resistant and susceptible chickpea genotypes reveals high-amplitude transcriptional dynamics in resistant plants, and also identifies TFs, PKs and phytohormone-crosstalk as core regulators for AB-resistance.",

In HD models, we discovered mitochondria with enlarged granules and distorted cristae, and thin sheet aggregates in double membrane-bound organelles. We used artificial intelligence to quantify mitochondrial granules, and proteomics to show differential protein content in HD mitochondria.

    "abstract": "X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional differences in degeneration and age of onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics that target XDP-related mechanisms requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is due, in part, to either a partial loss of TAF1 function and/or a SVA-driven pathological gain of function. A disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within intron 32 of TAF1, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight iPSC lines from XDP female carrier individuals, and identified isogenic lines where one clonal iPSC line expressed the wild-type X, and the two other clonal iPSC lines expressed the XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant transcript expression variation in humans, and found that SVA-F expression decreases slightly after 30 years of age in the neurotypical human brain and that TAF1 is modestly decreased in the majority of female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression is not sexually dymorphic and decreased after 15 years of age. These findings indicate that regional-, age- and sex-specific mechanisms regulate TAF1, highlighting the importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue analysis. We propose that the decreased TAF1 expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the XDP-specific partial loss of TAF1 function in patients, thereby passing a minimum threshold of TAF1 function, and triggering degeneration in the neostriatum.\n\nSignificance StatementXDP is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No therapeutics alter disease progression. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is possibly due to a partial loss of TAF1 function. While all XDP males are usually affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight stem cell lines from XDP female carrier individuals. Furthermore, we found that, uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression decreases after adolescence in healthy humans. We hypothesize that the decrease of TAF1 after adolescence in human caudate, in general, may underlie the vulnerability of the adult neostriatum in XDP.",

    "abstract": "Surface antigens of pathogens are commonly targeted by vaccine-elicited antibodies but antigenic variability, notably in RNA viruses such as influenza, HIV and SARS-CoV-2, pose challenges for control by vaccination. For example, influenza A(H3N2) entered the human population in 1968 causing a pandemic and has since been monitored, along with other seasonal influenza viruses, for the emergence of antigenic drift variants through intensive global surveillance and laboratory characterisation. Statistical models of the relationship between genetic differences among viruses and their antigenic similarity provide useful information to inform vaccine development though accurate identification of causative mutations is complicated by highly correlated genetic signals that arise due to the evolutionary process. Here, using a sparse hierarchical Bayesian analogue of an experimentally validated model for integrating genetic and antigenic data, we identify the genetic changes in influenza A(H3N2) virus that underpin antigenic drift. We show that incorporating protein structural data into variable selection helps resolve ambiguities arising due to correlated signals, with the proportion of variables representing haemagglutinin positions decisively included, or excluded, increased from 59.8% to 72.4%. The accuracy of variable selection judged by proximity to experimentally determined antigenic sites was improved simultaneously. Structure-guided variable selection thus improves confidence in the identification of genetic explanations of antigenic variation and we also show that prioritising the identification of causative mutations is not detrimental to the predictive capability of the analysis. Indeed, incorporating structural information into variable selection resulted in a model that could more accurately predict antigenic assay titres for phenotypically-uncharactrised virus from genetic sequence. Combined, these analyses have the potential to inform choices of reference viruses, the targeting of laboratory assays, and predictions of the evolutionary success of different genotypes, and can therefore be used to inform vaccine selection processes.",

    "abstract": "Microcin C-like compounds are natural Trojan horse peptide-nucleotide antibiotics produced by diverse bacteria. The ribosomally-synthesized peptide parts of these antibiotics are responsible for their facilitated transport into susceptible cells. Once inside the cell, the peptide part is degraded, releasing the toxic payload, an isoaspartyl-nucleotide that inhibits aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. Bacteria that produce microcin C-like compounds have evolved multiple ways to avoid self-intoxication. Here, we describe a new strategy through the action of S51 family peptidases, which we name MccG. MccG cleaves the toxic isoaspartyl-nucleotide rendering it inactive. While some MccG homologs are encoded in gene clusters responsible for McC-like compounds biosynthesis, most are encoded by stand-alone genes whose products may provide basal level of resistance to peptide-nucleotide antibiotics in phylogenetically distant bacteria.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe identified a natural substrate for a major phylogenetic clade of poorly characterized S51 family proteases from bacteria. We show that these proteins can contribute to basal level of resistance to an important class of natural antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Despite a yearly death toll of up to one million people due to parasite-related infections, parasites are still neglected in genomics research. While there is progress in the detection of bacteria and viruses using metagenomics in the context of infectious diseases, there are still challenges in metagenomics-based detection of parasites. Here, we implement a workflow for the detection of parasites from metagenomics data. We employ stringent cut off criteria to limit false positive detections. We analysed a total of 7.120 metagenomics samples of which 359 originated from gut microbiomes of livestock (pigs and chicken) from nine countries, and 6.761 from gut microbiomes of humans (adults and infants) from 25 countries. Five parasite-related genera were detected in livestock, of which Blastocystis sp. was detected in 71% of all pig herds and Eimeria in 83% of all chicken flocks. Distinct gut bacterial taxa were associated with Blastocystis sp. abundance in pigs. Nine parasite-related genera were detected in humans. Blastocystis sp. subtypes ST1, ST2, and ST3 were detected in all countries, and ST3 was most predominant. A higher overall prevalence of Blastocystis sp. was observed in low-income countries as compared to high-income countries, and a higher diversity of Blastocystis subtypes (ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4, ST6, ST7, ST8) was detected in high-income countries as compared to low-income countries. The prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in infant gut microbiome samples was lower as compared to adults. Overall, metagenomics-based analysis may be a promising tool for parasite detection from complex microbiome samples in clinical and veterinary medicine.\n\nMetagenomics could become the preferred method for parasite detection for a wide range of biological samples. Current parasite detection methods often rely on microscopic examination of the sample or using specific PCR. Metagenomics-based analyses may allow for a faster and more convenient way of detecting parasites in humans and animals, as this approach could serve as a one-for-all untargeted approach for pathogen detection, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites.",

    "abstract": "Type I collagen is the most abundant structural protein in the body and, with other fibrillar collagens, forms the fibrous network of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Another group of ECM polymers, the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and GAG-modified proteoglycans, play important roles in regulating collagen behaviors and contribute to the compositional, structural and mechanical complexity of the ECM. While the binding between collagen and small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) has been studied in detail, the interactions between collagen and the large bottlebrush proteoglycan versican are not well understood. Here, we report that versican binds collagen directly and regulates collagen structure and mechanics. Versican colocalizes with collagen fibers in vivo and binds to collagen via its C-terminal G3 domain (a non-GAG-modified domain present in all known versican isoforms) in vitro; it promotes the deposition of a highly-aligned collagen-rich matrix by fibroblasts. Versican also shows an unexpected effect on the rheology of collagen gels in vitro, causing decreased stiffness and attenuated shear strain stiffening, and the cleavage of versican in liver results in reduced tissue compression stiffening. Thus, versican is an important collagen binding partner, playing a role in modulating collagen organization and mechanics.",

BMPs have an established role in controlling cell fate and tissue morphogenesis in a diverse range of organisms and are known to maintain stem cells in adult Drosophila testes. Additional studies in embryonic and larval testes suggest BMP regulates germ cell behavior. However, the roles of BMP signaling in controlling testis stem cell formation have yet to be directly examined. Here, we explore the pattern of BMP activation during embryonic testis niche morphogenesis as well as niche maturation in larval testes. We also assess the impact of altered BMP signaling on these stages of development. Our data suggest that BMP signaling is critical for promoting germ cell identity in primordial germ cells during embryonic niche formation. During niche maturation, we also find that that BMP signaling is both necessary and sufficient for maintenance of a self- renewing germline stem cell (GSC) population, and that newly formed cyst stem cells (CySCs) are a source of BMP activating ligand. As development progresses, however, BMP activation is no longer sufficient to alter GSC self-renewal. Collectively, our work promotes a more thorough understanding of BMP as a key mechanism controlling stem cell development in Drosophila testes that has implications for the development of other organ systems.",

    "abstract": "When males contribute costly investments to offspring (i.e., paternal care or nuptial gifts), they are expected to have high confidence of paternity. While studies of species with exclusive male parental care have provided support for this hypothesis, paternity may be more uncertain in systems where males feed each mate. While mating co-occurs with each oviposition in many male-care systems, allowing control over insemination, mating is separated from egg-laying in nuptial-gift systems so that males typically compete more with rivals for fertilizations. Given the costly gift investment, and long refractory periods that limit male ability to gain fitness from frequent copulations, there should be strong selection to avoid cuckoldry, especially complete paternity failure. Further, because females are expected to mate frequently to obtain male-supplied nutrition prior to oviposition, males may be unable to avoid sperm competition because virgins will be rare (and lower quality), and females are expected to undermine male traits that limit remating or manipulate sperm stores. Thus, paternity sharing, in which males are not excluded from siring offspring completely, is an expected outcome of sperm competition in these systems. Using wild-caught females in two species (an orthopteran and a dipteran), in which sexually selected females compete for important male nuptial gifts, we examined paternity patterns and compared them to findings in other insects. Using microsatellite analysis of offspring and sperm stores, we found evidence of shared paternity in both study species, where very few males failed to sire offspring. Although paternity was not equal among sires, our estimates of paternity bias were similar to other insects with valuable nuptial gifts and contrasted with patterns in gryllid crickets where males supply little more than sperm and are frequently excluded from siring offspring. Further support for paternity-sharing is the lack of last-male sperm precedence in either of our study species.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidy, the phenomenon of having more than one copy of the genome in an organism, is common among haloarchaea. While providing short-term benefits for DNA repair, polyploidy is generally regarded as an  evolutionary trap that by the notion of the Mullers ratchet will inevitably conclude in the species decline or even extinction due to a gradual reduction in fitness. In most reported cases of polyploidy in archaea, the genetic state of the organism is considered as homoploidy i.e. all copies of the genome are identical. Here we demonstrate that while this is indeed the prevalent genetic status in the halophilic archaeon H. volcanii, its close relative H. mediterranei maintains a prolonged heteroploidy state in a non-selective environment once a second allele is introduced. Moreover, a strong genetic linkage was observed between two distant loci in H. mediterranei indicating a low rate of homologous recombination while almost no such linkage was shown in H. volcanii indicating a high rate of recombination in the latter species.\n\nWe suggest that H. volcanii escapes Mullers ratchet by means of an effective chromosome-equalizing gene-conversion mechanism facilitated by highly active homologous recombination, whereas H. mediterranei must elude the ratchet via a different, yet to be elucidated mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Genes for major ribosomal RNAs (rDNA) are present in multiple copies organized in tandem arrays. Number and position of rDNA loci can change dynamically and their re-patterning is presumably driven by repetitive sequences. We explored a peculiar rDNA organization in several representatives of Lepidoptera with either extremely large or numerous rDNA clusters. We combined molecular cytogenetics with analyses of second and third generation sequencing data to show that rDNA spreads as a transcription unit and reveal association between rDNA and various repeats. Furthermore, we performed comparative long read analyses between the species with derived rDNA distribution and moths with a single rDNA locus, which is considered ancestral. Our results suggest that satellite arrays, rather than mobile elements, facilitate homology-mediated spread of rDNA via either integration of extrachromosomal rDNA circles or ectopic recombination. The latter arguably better explains preferential spread of rDNA into terminal regions of lepidopteran chromosomes as efficiency of ectopic recombination depends on proximity of homologous sequences to telomeres.",

Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of converting intestinal epithelial cells to insulin-producing, glucose-responsive {beta}-like cells by targeted inhibition of Foxo1. We have shown that this can be achieved by genetic ablation in gut Neurogenin3 progenitors, adenoviral or shRNA-mediated inhibition in human gut organoids, and chemical inhibition in Akita mice, a model of insulin-deficient diabetes. In the present study, we provide evidence that two novel Foxo1 inhibitors, FBT432 and FBT374 have glucose-lowering and gut {beta}-like cell-inducing properties in mice rendered insulin-deficient by administration of streptozotocin. FBT432 is also highly effective in combination with a Notch inhibitor in this model.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe capacity of cells to process information is currently used to design cell-based tools for ecological, industrial, and biomedical applications such as detecting dangerous chemicals or for bioremediation. In most applications, individual cells are used as the information processing unit. However, single cell engineering is limited by the necessary molecular complexity and the accompanying metabolic burden of synthetic circuits. To overcome these limitations, synthetic biologists have begun engineering multicellular systems that combine cells with designed subfunctions. To further advance information processing in synthetic multicellular systems, we introduce the application of reservoir computing. Reservoir computers (RCs) approximate a temporal signal processing task via a fixed-rule dynamic network (the reservoir) with a regression-based readout. Importantly, RCs eliminate the need of network rewiring, as different tasks can be approximated with the same reservoir. Previous work has already demonstrated the capacity of single cells, as well as populations of neurons, to act as reservoirs. In this work, we extend reservoir computing in multicellular populations with the widespread mechanism of diffusion-based cell-cell signaling. As a proof-of-concept, we simulated a reservoir made of a 3D community of cells communicating via diffusible molecules and used it to approximate two benchmark signal processing tasks, computing median and parity functions from binary input signals. We demonstrate that a diffusion-based multicellular reservoir is a feasible synthetic framework for performing complex temporal computing tasks that provides a computational advantage over single cell reservoirs. We also identified a number of biological properties that can affect the computational performance of these processing systems.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic modelling has considerably improved our understanding of complex molecular mechanisms. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are the most detailed and popular approach to modelling the dynamics of molecular systems. However, their application in signalling networks, characterised by multi-state molecular complexes, can be prohibitive. Contemporary modelling methods, such as rule-based (RB) modelling, have addressed these issues. The advantages of RB modelling over ODEs have been presented and discussed in numerous reviews. In this study, we conduct a direct comparison of the time courses of a molecular system founded on the same reaction network but encoded in the two frameworks. To make such a comparison, a set of reactions that underlie an ODE model was manually encoded in the Kappa language, one of the RB implementations. A comparison of the models was performed at the level of model specification and results were acquired through model simulations. Conforming to previous reports, we confirm that the Kappa model recapitulated the general dynamics of its ODE counterpart with minor differences. These differences occur whenever molecules have multiple sites binding the same interactor. Furthermore, activation of these molecules in the RB model is slower than in the ODE one but can be corrected by revision of the rate constants used in the relevant rules. As in previous reports on other molecular systems, we find that, also in the case of the DARPP-32 reaction network, the RB representation offers a more expressive and flexible syntax that facilitates access to fine details of the model, facilitating model reuse. In parallel with these analyses, this manuscript reports a refactored model of the DARPP-32 interaction network that can serve as a canvas for the development of a more complex interaction network to study this important molecular system.",

However, the neurophysiological mechanisms of DBS remain largely unknown, because of the difficulty of obtaining cellular resolution recordings without electrical interference. Here, we performed high-speed membrane voltage fluorescence imaging of individual hippocampal CA1 neurons during DBS in awake mice. We discovered that DBS, delivered at either 40Hz or 140Hz, reliably depolarizes somatic membrane potentials. Further, DBS enhanced spike rates and paced membrane voltage and spike timing at the stimulation frequency, though more prominent at 40Hz than 140Hz. To determine how DBS induced membrane voltage change impacts neurons ability to process inputs, we optogenetically evoked membrane depolarization. We found that neurons become unreliable in responding to optogenetic inputs during DBS, particularly during 140Hz DBS. These results demonstrate that DBS produces powerful membrane depolarization that interferes with neurons ability to process inputs, creating information lesion.",

    "abstract": "In meditation practices that involve focused attention to a specific object, novice practitioners often experience moments of distraction (i.e., mind wandering). Previous studies have investigated the neural correlates of mind wandering during meditation practice through Electroencephalography (EEG) using linear metrics (e.g., oscillatory power). However, their results are not fully consistent. Since the brain is known to be a chaotic/nonlinear system, it is possible that linear metrics cannot fully capture complex dynamics present in the EEG signal. In this study, we assess whether nonlinear EEG signatures can be used to characterize mind wandering during breath focus meditation in novice practitioners. For that purpose, we adopted an experience sampling paradigm in which 25 participants were iteratively interrupted during meditation practice to report whether they were focusing on the breath or thinking about something else. We compared the complexity of EEG signals during mind wandering and breath focus states using three different algorithms: Higuchis fractal dimension (HFD), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), and Sample entropy (SampEn). Our results showed that EEG complexity was generally reduced during mind wandering relative to breath focus states. We conclude that EEG complexity metrics are appropriate to disentangle mind wandering from breath focus states in novice meditation practitioners, and therefore, they could be used in future EEG neurofeedback protocols to facilitate meditation practice.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive evolution of clonally dividing cells and microbes is the ultimate cause of cancer and infectious diseases. The possibility of constraining the adaptation of cell populations, by inhibiting proteins that enhance their evolvability has therefore attracted substantial interest. However, our current understanding of how individual genes influence the speed of adaptation is limited, partly because accurately tracking adaptation for many experimental cell populations in parallel is challenging. Here we use a high throughput artificial laboratory evolution (ALE) platform to track the adaptation of >18.000 cell populations corresponding to single gene deletion strains in the haploid yeast deletion collection. We report that the fitness of gene knockout near-perfectly (R2=0.91) predicts their adaptation dynamics under arsenic exposure, leaving virtually no role for dedicated evolvability functions in the corresponding proteins. We tracked the adaptation of another >23.000 yeast gene knockout populations to a diverse range of selection pressures and generalised the almost perfect (R2=0.72 to 0.98) capacity of initial fitness to predict the rate of adaptation. Finally, we reconstruct mutations in the genes FPS1, ASK10, and ARR3, which together account for almost all arsenic adaptation in wildtype cells, in gene deletions covering a broad fitness range. We show that the predictability of arsenic adaptation can be understood almost entirely as a global epistasis phenomenon where excluding arsenic from cells, through these mutations, is more beneficial in cells with low arsenic fitness regardless of what causes the arsenic defects. The lack of genes with a meaningful effect on the adaptation dynamics of clonally reproducing cell populations diminishes the prospects of developing adjuvant drugs aiming to slow antimicrobial and chemotherapy resistance.",

However, a comprehensive assessment of performance-influencing factors like the sequencing depth, read length or the number of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) as well as guidance regarding the choice of methodology are still lacking. In this work, we evaluated the ability of six available methods to reconstruct full-length BCRs using one simulated and three experimental SMART-seq datasets. In addition, we validated that the BCRs assembled in silico recognize their intended targets when expressed as monoclonal antibodies. We observed that methods like BALDR, BASIC and BRACER showed the best overall performance across the tested datasets and conditions whereas only BASIC demonstrated acceptable results on very short read libraries. Furthermore, the de novo assembly-based methods BRACER and BALDR were the most accurate in reconstructing BCRs harboring different degrees of SHMs in the variable domain, while TRUST4, MiXCR and BASIC were the fastest.

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully advanced our understanding of genetic basis of complex traits. Despite the fruitful discovery of GWASs, most GWAS samples are collected from European populations, and these GWASs are often criticized for their lack of ancestry diversity. Trans-ancestry association mapping (TRAM) offers an exciting opportunity to fill the gap of disparities in genetic studies between non-Europeans and Europeans. Here we propose a statistical method, LOG-TRAM, to leverage the local genetic architecture for TRAM. By using biobank-scale datasets, we showed that LOG-TRAM can greatly improve the statistical power of identifying risk variants in under-represented populations while producing well-calibrated p-values. We applied LOG-TRAM to the GWAS summary statistics of 29 complex traits/diseases from Biobank Japan (BBJ) and UK Biobank (UKBB), and achieved substantial gains in power (the effective sample sizes increased by 49% in average compared to the BBJ GWASs) and effective correction of confounding biases compared to existing methods. Finally, we demonstrated that LOG-TRAM can be successfully applied to identify ancestry-specific loci and the LOG-TRAM output can be further used for construction of more accurate polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in under-represented populations.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein 1 is almost exclusively responsible for intracellular transport toward the minus-end of microtubules in animal cells. One of the key factors for the unidirectional movement of dynein is the asymmetry of the unbinding of the motor from the microtubule when an external load is applied; it dissociates more easily from microtubules with minus-end directed loading than with plus-end directed loading. To elucidate the molecular basis for this property, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to identify the key residues responsible for asymmetry, which were then examined experimentally. First, we reproduced asymmetry in the unbinding behavior of dynein using coarse-grained simulations. Then, data analysis together with mutational analysis in silico predicted the specific residues that may be responsible for the asymmetry in unbinding. To examine this prediction, we expressed and purified recombinant dynein with mutations in either of the identified key residues. Consistent with the simulations, one of the mutants did not exhibit asymmetry in the in vitro unbinding assay. Moreover, the mutant dynein was able to bind and move diffusely along a microtubule but was unable to restrict its movement to the minus-end direction. Our results demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically how the key residue on the microtubule-binding domain generates asymmetry in unbinding, which is a critical mechanism for the unidirectional movement of dynein along a microtubule track.\n\nSignificance StatementCytoplasmic dynein moves to the minus end of microtubules. This unidirectional dynein motility provides the driving force for various cellular activities including vesicle transport, organelle positioning and cell division. One of the key factors for dynein to exhibit unidirectional movement is the asymmetry of unbinding of dynein from the microtubule depending on the direction of external load. By combining computational simulations and in vitro experiments, we identified a residue responsible for the asymmetry. A point mutation at the residue indeed abolished unidirectional motility, highlighting the importance of the asymmetric unbinding property in dyneins unidirectional movement.",

In Alzheimers disease (AD) animal models, TSPO is first overexpressed in astrocytes and then in microglia. However, the precise role of TSPO in the onset and progression of pathology and symptoms characteristic of the disease remains unknown. Here, we report that in the absence of TSPO in 3xTgAD mice the expected disease onset is significantly delayed and a reduction is seen in the hippocampal load of poorly and highly aggregated forms of Tau (-44% and -82%, respectively) and A{beta}42 (-25% and -95%, respectively), at 9 months of age. In addition, the astrocyte reactivity was decreased in 3xTgAD.TSPO-/- mice with a reduction in the morphologic complexity and the size of astrocytes in the dorso-dorsal hippocampus and the hilus. Functionally, the absence of TSPO ameliorated the cognitive consequences of adeno-associated virus-induced Tau over-expression in the hippocampus. This suggests that TSPO plays an important role in the active disease progression of AD. TSPO-inhibiting drugs thus merit further exploration as to their potential to reduce the rate of neurodegenerative disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear feedback controllers are ubiquitous features of biological systems at different scales. A key motif arising in these systems is a sequestration-based feedback. As a physiological example of this type of feedback architecture, platelets (specialized cells involved in blood clotting) differentiate from stem cells, and this process is activated by a protein called Thrombopoietin (TPO). Platelets actively sequester and degrade TPO, creating negative feedback whereby any depletion of platelets increases the levels of freely available TPO that upregulates platelet production. We show similar examples of sequestration-based feedback in intracellular biomolecular circuits involved in heat-shock response and microRNA regulation. Our systematic analysis of this feedback motif reveals that platelets induced degradation of TPO is critical in enhancing system robustness to external disturbances. In contrast, reversible sequestration of TPO without degradation results in poor robustness to disturbances. We develop exact analytical results quantifying the limits to which the sensitivity to disturbances can be attenuated by sequestration-based feedback. Next, we consider the stochastic formulation of the circuit that takes into account low-copy number fluctuations in feedback components. Interestingly, our results show that the extent of random fluctuations are enhanced with increasing feedback strength, but can exhibit local maxima and minima across parameter regimes. In summary, our systematic analysis highlights design principles for enhancing the robustness of sequestration-based feedback mechanisms to external disturbances and inherent noise in molecular counts.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages show remarkable functional pleiotropy that is dependent on microenvironmental context. Prior studies have characterized how polarizing cytokines alter the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscape. Here we characterized the immune-threat appropriate responses of polarized macrophages by measuring the single-cell signaling dynamics of transcription factor NF{kappa}B. Leveraging a fluorescent protein reporter mouse, primary macrophages were polarized into 6 states and stimulated with 8 different stimuli resulting in a vast dataset. Linear Discriminant Analysis revealed how NF{kappa}B signaling codons compose the immune threat level of stimuli, placing polarization states along a linear continuum between the M1/M2 dichotomy. Machine learning classification revealed losses of stimulus distinguishability with polarization, which reflect a switch from sentinel to more canalized effector functions. However, the stimulus-response dynamics and discrimination patterns did not fit the M1/M2 continuum. Instead, our analysis suggests macrophage functional niches within a multi-dimensional polarization landscape.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPolarization of macrophages affects stimulus-response NF{kappa}B dynamics\nC_LIO_LIFor each condition, NF{kappa}B signaling codons quantify the \"immune threat\" level\nC_LIO_LIMachine Learning reveals polarization-induced canalization of stimulus-responses\nC_LIO_LINF{kappa}B stimulus-responses may define a landscape of macrophage states\nC_LI\n\neTOC blurbMacrophages are profoundly responsive to their tissue microenvironment, but how that affects their pathogen response functions has not been investigated systematically. Here we studied how their signaling response is affected by six polarizing cytokines. We found each modulates their stimulus-responses highly specifically, producing distinct patterns of stimulus-discrimination. Thereby, these stimulus-response specificities may be used to describe a landscape of functional macrophage states.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485991v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (77K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d34d5forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17cc0eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d6022org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1526f72_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of mammalian sex chromosomes is a small region of sequence identity that allows pairing, crossover, recombination, and proper chromosome segregation during male meiosis. The structure of the mouse PAR is largely unknown. Here, we developed a new assembly method to robustly resolve repetitive sequences and employed highly accurate long-read sequencing data to reveal the entire PAR sequence. The PAR of the widely-used inbred strain C57BL/6J is [~]700 kb, comprising 10 protein- coding genes in a mass of complex repetitive sequences. A large segmental duplication exhibiting copy-number polymorphisms even among C57BL/6J littermates is present. High GC-content exons and short introns are common properties of PAR genes and are the consequence of maintaining gene function, while PAR is rapidly evolving. Elucidating the mouse PAR sequence completes the mouse euchromatic genome sequencing and enables the exploration of the function and evolution of the PAR using modern molecular genetic approaches.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a mouse Infinium DNA methylation array that contains 297,415 probes to capture the diversity of mouse DNA methylation biology. We present a mouse DNA methylation atlas as a rich reference resource of 1,239 DNA samples encompassing distinct tissues, strains, age, sex, and pathologies. We describe applications for comparative epigenomics, genomic imprinting, epigenetic inhibitors, PDX assessment, backcross tracing, and epigenetic clocks. We dissect DNA methylation processes associated with differentiation, aging and tumorigenesis. Notably, we find that tissue-specific methylation signatures localize to binding sites for transcription factors controlling the corresponding tissue development. Age-associated hypermethylation is enriched at regions of Polycomb repression, while hypomethylation is enhanced at regions bound by cohesin complex members. ApcMin/+ polyp-associated hypermethylation affects enhancers regulating intestinal differentiation, while hypomethylation targets AP-1 binding sites. This MM285 mouse array is widely accessible to the research community, and will accelerate future high sample-throughput studies in this important model organism.",
