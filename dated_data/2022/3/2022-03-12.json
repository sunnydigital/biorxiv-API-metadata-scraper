    "abstract": "Flippase proteins exchanging phospholipids between the cytoplasmic membrane leaflets have been identified in Eukaryotes but remained largely unknown in Prokaryotes. Only MprF proteins that synthesize aminoacyl phospholipids in some bacteria have been found to contain a domain that translocates the produced lipids. We show here that this domain, which we named  prokaryotic phospholipid translocator (PplT), is widespread in Bacteria and Archaea, encoded as a separate protein or fused to different types of enzymes. We also demonstrate that the Escherichia coli PplT protein interacts with many phospholipid-synthetic enzymes and deletion of pplT impaired bacterial growth, which supports its potential role in membrane lipid metabolism. PplT domain proteins may be general prokaryotic lipid flippases with critical roles in cellular homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Wool traits of rabbits are important in fiber production and model organism research on hair growth, while the genetic architecture remains obscure. In this study, we focused on wool characteristics in Angora rabbits, a well-known fiber breed. Balancing genotyping cost and variant detection, we proposed low-coverage whole genome sequencing (LCS) followed by genotype imputation for genotyping. Different genotype imputation strategies, sequencing coverages and sample sizes were compared, and we found by BaseVar + STITCH, genotyping reached high accuracy (>0.97) at a depth of 1.0X and a sample size > 300. Multivariate GWAS followed by conditional GWAS and confidence interval estimation of QTLs were used to reveal the genetic architecture of wool traits. Six QTLs were detected with phenotypic variation contribution ranging from 0.42% to 7.50%. Gene-level mapping implicated FGF10 associated with fiber growth and diameter, which supported previous function research on fibroblast growth factor family in other species and provided genetic information for wool rabbit breeding. We suggest LCS as a cost-effective alternative for assessing common variants. GWAS combined with LCS can excavate QTLs and fine-map genes associated with quantitative traits. This study provides a powerful analysis mentality for investigating complex traits, which lays the foundation for genomic breeding.",

Here we present CopyKit, a comprehensive set of computational methods for the pre-processing and analysis of single cell copy number data to resolve clonal substructure and reconstruct genetic lineages in tumors. We performed single cell DNA sequencing of 2977 cells from multiple spatial regions in two liver metastasis and 7365 cells from three primary tumors with matched metastatic tissues. In the liver metastases, CopyKit resolved clonal substructure in different spatial regions, which revealed both clonal intermixing and spatial segregation in the tumor mass. In the matched metastatic colorectal and breast cancers, CopyKit resolved metastatic lineages and identified subclones and genomic events that were associated with metastases. These applications show that CopyKit is comprehensive tool for resolving copy number substructure in tumors.",

VPS13s are anchored between membranes via interactions with receptors, including both peripheral or integral membrane proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of VPS13s adaptor binding domain (VAB) complexed with a Pro-X-Pro peptide recognition motif present in one such receptor, the integral membrane protein Mcp1p, and show biochemically that other Pro-X-Pro motifs bind the VAB in the same site. We further demonstrate that Mcp1p and another integral membrane protein that interacts directly with human VPS13A, XK, are scramblases. This finding supports an emerging paradigm of a partnership between bulk lipid transport proteins and scramblases. Scramblases can re-equilibrate lipids between membrane leaflets as lipids are removed from or inserted into, respectively, the cytosolic leaflet of donor and acceptor organelles in the course of protein-mediated transport.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a common, devastating, and incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to drive PD, with genetic and pathological evidence pointing towards aberrant protein homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. PD is clinically highly heterogeneous, it is likely that different mechanisms underlie the pathology in different individuals, each requiring a specific targeted treatment. Recent advances in stem cell technology and fluorescent live-cell imaging have enabled the generation of patient-derived neurons with different mechanistic subtypes of PD. Here, we performed multi-dimensional fluorescent labelling of organelles in iPSC-derived neurons, in healthy control cells, and in four different disease subclasses. We generated a machine learning-based model that can simultaneously predict the presence of disease, and its primary mechanistic subtype. We independently trained a series of classifiers using both quantitative single-cell fluorescence variables and images to build deep neural networks. Quantitative cellular profile-based classifiers achieve an accuracy of 82%, whilst image based deep neural networks predict control, and four distinct disease subtypes with an accuracy of 95%. The classifiers achieve their accuracy across all subtypes primarily utilizing the organellar features of the mitochondria, with additional contribution of the lysosomes, confirming their biological importance in PD. Taken together, we show that machine learning approaches applied to patient-derived cells are able to predict disease subtypes, demonstrating that this approach may be used to guide personalized treatment approaches in the future.",

    "abstract": "Background/AimsCholestatic liver diseases (CLD) are the leading indication for pediatric liver transplantation. Increased intrahepatic bile acid concentrations cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to maintain homeostasis. UPR dysregulation, including the inositol-requiring enzyme 1/X-box protein 1 (IRE1/XBP1) pathway, is associated with several adult liver diseases. We evaluated hepatic UPR expression in pediatric patients with end-stage CLD and hypothesize that an inability to appropriately activate the hepatic IRE1/XBP1 pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of CLD.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated 34 human liver explants. Cohorts included: pediatric CLD (Alagille, ALGS, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, PFIC), pediatric non-cholestatic liver disease controls (autoimmune hepatitis, AIH), adult CLD, and normal controls. We performed RNA-seq, quantitative PCR, and western blotting to measure expression differences of the hepatic UPR and other signaling pathways.\n\nResultsMetascape pathway analysis demonstrated that the KEGG  protein processing in ER pathway was downregulated in pediatric CLD compared to normal controls. Pediatric CLD had decreased hepatic IRE1/XBP1 pathway gene expression and decreased protein expression of p-IRE1 compared to normal controls. These CLD changes were not disease-specific to ALGS or PFIC. IRE1/XBP1 pathway gene expression was decreased in pediatric CLD compared to AIH disease controls.\n\nConclusionPediatric CLD explants have decreased gene and protein expression of the protective IRE1/XBP1 pathway and down-regulated KEGG protein processing in the ER pathways. IRE1/XBP1 pathway expression differences occur when compared to both normal and non-cholestatic disease controls. Attenuated expression of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway is associated with cholestatic diseases and could be targeted to treat pediatric CLD.",

    "abstract": "Assembly of protein complexes is facilitated by assembly chaperones. Alpha and gamma adaptin binding protein (AAGAB) is a chaperone governing the assembly of the heterotetrameric adaptor complexes 1 and 2 (AP1 and AP2) involved in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking. Here, we found that before AP1/2 binding, AAGAB exists as a homotetramer. AAGAB tetramerization is mediated by its C-terminal domain, which is critical for AAGAB stability and is missing in mutant proteins found in patients with the skin disease punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 (PPKP1). We solved the crystal structure of the tetramerization domain (TD), revealing a dimer of dimer assembly. Interestingly, AAGAB uses the same TD to recognize and stabilize the {gamma} subunit in the AP1 complex and the  subunit in the AP2 complex, forming binary complexes containing only one copy of AAGAB. These findings demonstrate a dual role of TD in stabilizing resting AAGAB and binding to substrates, providing a molecular explanation for disease-causing AAGAB mutations. The oligomerization state transition mechanism may also underlie the functions of other assembly chaperones.",

    "abstract": "The problem of predicting a proteins 3D structure from its primary amino acid sequence is a longstanding challenge in structural biology. Recently, approaches like AlphaFold have achieved remarkable performance on this task by combining deep learning techniques with coevolutionary data from multiple sequence alignments of related protein sequences. The use of coevolutionary information is critical to these models accuracy, and without it their predictive performance drops considerably. In living cells, however, the 3D structure of a protein is fully determined by its primary sequence and the biophysical laws that cause it to fold into a low-energy configuration. Thus, it should be possible to predict a proteins structure from only its primary sequence by learning a highly-accurate biophysical energy function. We provide evidence that AlphaFold has learned such an energy function, and uses coevolution data to solve the global search problem of finding a low-energy conformation. We demonstrate that AlphaFolds learned potential function can be used to rank the quality of candidate protein structures with state-of-the-art accuracy, without using any coevolution data. Finally, we explore several applications of this potential function, including the prediction of protein structures without MSAs.",

    "abstract": "Synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple systems atrophy (MSA) have the same hallmark pathologic feature of misfolded -synuclein protein accumulation in the brain. PD patients who carry -syn hereditary mutations tend to have an earlier onset and more severe clinical symptoms and pathology than sporadic PD patients who carry wild-type (WT) -syn. Therefore, revealing the structural effect of -syn hereditary mutations on the wild-type fibril structure can help us understand synucleinopathies structural basis. Here, we present a 3.38 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of -synuclein fibrils containing the hereditary A53E mutation. The A53E fibril is symmetrically composed of two protofilaments, as are many other synucleopathic structures - including WT. Interestingly, the interface between the protofilaments in A53E has significantly less buried surface area than all other documented fibril structures of -syn and its other mutants. The A53E fibril also exhibits slower formation/growth in in vitro fibrillation experiment compared to other mutants. This implies that the structural differences - both in the protofilament and between each protofilament of A53E - change the aggregation mechanism, or in the least, its kinetics of formation. These differences influence the molecular characteristics of each fibril mutant and likely plays a macro-scale role in progressing one clinical pathology over another.",

The tumor suppressor WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX), one of the most active fragile sites in the human genome (FRA16D), is commonly altered in pancreatic cancer. However, the direct contribution of WWOX loss to pancreatic cancer development and progression remains largely unknown. Here, we report that combined conditional deletion of Wwox and activation of KRasG12D in Ptf1a-CreER-expressing mice results in accelerated formation of precursor lesions and pancreatic carcinoma. At the molecular level, we found that WWOX physically interacts with SMAD3 and BMP2, which are known activators of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway. In the absence of WWOX, TGF{beta}/BMPs signaling was enhanced, leading to increased macrophage infiltration and enhanced cancer stemness. Finally, overexpression of WWOX in patient-derived xenografts led to diminished aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our findings reveal an essential role of WWOX in pancreatic cancer development and progression and underscore its role as a bona fide tumor suppressor.",

Dynein meets a unique challenge in meiosis by moving chromosomes tethered to the nuclear envelope to facilitate homolog pairing essential for gametogenesis. Though processive dynein motility requires binding to an activating adaptor, the identity of the activating adaptor required for dynein to move meiotic chromosomes is unknown. We show that the meiosis-specific nuclear-envelope protein KASH5 is a dynein activating adaptor: KASH5 directly binds dynein using a mechanism conserved among activating adaptors and converts dynein into a processive motor. We map the dynein-binding surface of KASH5, identifying mutations that abrogate dynein binding in vitro and disrupt recruitment of the dynein machinery to the nuclear envelope in cultured cells and mouse spermatocytes in vivo. Our study identifies KASH5 as the first transmembrane dynein activating adaptor and provides molecular insights into how it activates dynein during meiosis.",

    "abstract": "Gaining insight into the behavior of bacteria at the single cell level is important given that heterogeneous microenvironments strongly influence microbial physiology. The hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a technique that provides in situ molecular signal amplification, enabling simultaneous mapping of multiple target RNAs at small spatial scales. To refine this method for biofilm applications, we designed and validated new probes to visualize expression of key catabolic genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa aggregates. In addition to using existing probes for the dissimilatory nitrate reductase (narG), we developed probes for a terminal oxidase (ccoN1), nitrite reductase (nirS), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), and acetate kinase (ackA). These probes can be used to determine gene expression levels both in liquid culture and in biofilms. Using these probes, we quantified gene expression across oxygen gradients in aggregate populations grown using the agar block biofilm assay (ABBA). We observed distinct patterns of catabolic gene expression, with upregulation occurring in particular ABBA regions both within individual aggregates and over the aggregate population. Aerobic respiration (ccoN1) showed peak expression under oxic conditions, whereas fermentation (ackA) showed peak expression in the anoxic cores of high metabolic activity aggregates near the air-agar interface. Denitrification genes narG, nirS, and nosZ showed peak expression in hypoxic and anoxic regions, although nirS expression was much stronger in anoxic environments compared to other denitrification genes. These results reveal that the microenvironment correlates with catabolic gene expression in aggregates, and demonstrate the utility of HCR in unveiling cellular activities at the microscale in heterogeneous populations.\n\nImportanceTo understand bacteria in diverse contexts we must understand the variations in behaviors and metabolisms they express spatiotemporally. Populations of bacteria are known to be heterogeneous, but the ways this variation manifests can be challenging to characterize due to technical limitations. By focusing on energy conservation, we demonstrate that HCR v3.0 can visualize nuances in gene expression, allowing us to understand how metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms responds to microenvironmental variation at high spatial resolution. We validated probes for four catabolic genes: a constitutively expressed oxidase, acetate kinase, nitrite reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase. We showed that the genes for different modes of metabolism are expressed in overlapping but distinct subpopulations according to oxygen concentrations in a predictable fashion. The spatial transcriptomic technique described here has the potential to be used to map microbial activities across diverse environments.",

    "abstract": "IRONMAN is a family of small peptides which positively regulate the Fe deficiency response. However, the molecular mechanism by which OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 regulate Fe homeostasis was unclear. Here, we reveal that OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 interact with the potential Fe sensors, OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2. OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 contain a conserved 17-amino acid C-terminal region which is responsible for the interactions with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2. The OsIMA1 overexpressing plants have the increased seed Fe concentration and the reduced fertility, as observed in the hrz1-2 loss-of-function mutant plants. Moreover, the expression trends of Fe deficiency inducible genes in the OsIMA1 overexpressing plants are the same to those in the hrz1-2. Co-expression assays suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 promote the degradation of OsIMA1 proteins. As the interaction partners of OsHRZ1, the OsPRI proteins also interact with OsHRZ2. The conserved C-terminal region of four OsPRIs contributes to the interactions with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2. An artificial IMA (aIMA) derived from the C-terminal of OsPRI1 can be also degraded by OsHRZ1. Moreover, the aIMA overexpressing rice plants accumulate more Fe without reduction of fertility. This work establishes the link between OsIMAs and OsHRZs, and develops a new strategy for Fe fortification in rice.",

    "abstract": "The accurate characterization of structural variation is crucial for our understanding of how large chromosomal alterations affect phenotypic differences and contribute to genome evolution. Whole-genome sequencing is a popular approach for identifying structural variants, but the accuracy of popular tools remains unclear due to the limitations of existing benchmarks. Moreover, the performance of these tools for predicting variants in non-human genomes is less certain, as most tools were developed and benchmarked using data from the human genome.\n\nTo address this problem, multiple short- and long-read tools were benchmarked using real and simulated Caenorhabditis elegans whole-genome sequence data. To evaluate the use of long-read data for the validation of short-read predictions, the agreement between predictions from a short-read ensemble learning method and long-read tools were compared. The results obtained from simulated data indicate that the best performing tool is contingent on the type and size of the variant, as well as the sequencing depth of coverage. These results also highlight the need for reference datasets generated from real data that can be used as  ground truth in benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Dominance rank is a vital descriptor of social dynamics in animal societies and regularly used in studies to explain observed interaction patterns. However, researchers can choose between different indices and standardizations, and can specify dyadic rank relations differently when studying interaction distributions. These researcher degrees of freedom potentially introduce biases into studies and reduce replicability. Here, I demonstrate the impact of researcher choices by comparing the performance of different combinations of rank index, standardization, and model specification when explaining dyadic interaction patterns in sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys). I show that while no combination consistently performed best across interaction types (aggression, grooming, proximity, supplants), model specifications allowing for non-linear patterns performed better than other models on average. Choices made in pre-processing and model building impacted model performance and subsequent interpretation of results. Researchers could end up describing social systems differently based on the same data. These results highlight the impact of researcher choices in the processing of behavioural data and potential limitations when using indirect species comparisons in animal behaviour research. To increase repeatability, researchers could make the impact of their processing choices more transparent and report results using a variety of indices and model specifications.",

    "abstract": "Zika is a vector-borne disease caused by an arbovirus (ZIKV) and overwhelmingly transmitted by Ae. aegypti. This disease is linked to adverse fetal outcomes, mostly microcephaly in newborns, and other clinical aspects such as acute febrile illness and neurologic complications, for example, Guillain-Barre syndrome. One of the actual most promising strategies to mitigate arbovirus transmission involves releasing Ae. aegypti mosquitoes carrying the maternally inherited endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. The presence of Wolbachia is associated with a reduced susceptibility to arboviruses and a fitness cost in mosquito life-history traits as fecundity and fertility. However, the mechanisms by which Wolbachia influences metabolic pathways leading to differences in egg production remains poorly known. To investigate the impact of co-infections on the reproductive tract of the mosquito, we applied an isobaric labeling-based quantitative proteomic strategy to investigate the influence of Wolbachia wMel and ZIKV infection in Ae. aegypti ovaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complete proteome of Ae. aegypti ovaries reported so far, with a total of 3,913 proteins identified, also,were able to quantify a total of 1,044 Wolbachia proteins in complex sample tissue of Ae. aegypti ovary.. Furthermore, we discuss proteins and pathways altered in Ae. aegypti during ZIKV infections, Wolbachia infections, co-infection Wolbachia/ZIKV, and compared with no infection, focusing on immune and reproductive aspects of Ae. aegypti. The modified aspects were mostly related to the immune priming enhancement by Wolbachia presence and the modulation of the Juvenile Hormone pathway caused by both microorganisms infection.\n\nHighlightsO_LIProteome changes in Ae. aegypti, Wolbachia, and ZIKV interactions\nC_LIO_LIA great diversity of Wolbachia proteins were quantified in Ae. aegypti ovary\nC_LIO_LIJuvenile Hormone pathway is modulated by both infections\nC_LIO_LIWolbachia enhances Ae. aegypti immune priming mechanism\nC_LIO_LIZIKV unsettles host immune response by reducing antimicrobial peptides production\nC_LIO_LICoinfection triggers oxidative stress and a lack of vitellogenin precursors\nC_LI",

Comparisons with measurements in microfluidic devices, where the progeny of 80-150 individual cells are followed, show good agreement between individual trajectories and mathematical and molecular results. Further analysis of individual progenies shows the heterogeneity of individual cell contributions to global repair efficacy.

Here we explore their synergistic combination to extract and concentrate a heterologous sesquiterpenoid produced by engineered green algal cells.

Subsequent continuous membrane extraction of patchoulol from dodecane enabled product concentration in a methanol stream as well as dodecane recovery for its reuse. A structure-based prediction using machine learning was used to model a process whereby 100% patchoulol recovery from dodecane could be achieved with solvent-resistant nanofiltration membranes. Solvent consumption, E-factor, and economic sustainability were assessed and compared with existing patchoulol production processes.

The Sterile Insect Technique is a valuable alternative but is limited by the slow, error-prone, and wasteful sex-separation requirement. Here, we present four Genetic Sexing Strains (two for each Aedes species) based on fluorescence markers linked to the m and M sex loci, allowing for the isolation of transgenic males. Furthermore, we demonstrate how combining these sexing strains enables the production of non-transgenic males. Scaling-up would allow the sorting of 100,000 first instar male larvae in under 1.5 hours with an estimated 0.01-0.1% female contamination. Cost-efficiency analyses revealed that using these strains could result in important savings while setting up and running a mass-rearing facility.

    "abstract": "Collateral circulation in the circle of Willis (CoW), closely associated with disease mechanisms and treatment outcomes, can be effectively investigated using one-dimensional-zero-dimensional hemodynamic simulations. As the entire cardiovascular system is considered in the simulation, it captures the systemic effects of local arterial changes, thus reproducing collateral circulation that reflects biological phenomena. The simulation facilitates rapid assessment of clinically relevant hemodynamic quantities under patient-specific conditions by incorporating clinical data. During patient-specific simulations, the impact of clinical data uncertainty on the simulated quantities should be quantified to obtain reliable results. However, as uncertainty quantification (UQ) is time-consuming and computationally expensive, its implementation in time-sensitive clinical applications is considered impractical. Therefore, we constructed a surrogate model based on machine learning using simulation data. The model accurately predicts the flow rate and pressure in the CoW in a few milliseconds. This reduced computation time enables the UQ execution with 100 000 predictions in a few minutes on a single CPU core and in less than a minute on a GPU. We performed UQ to predict the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion (CH), a life-threatening condition that can occur after carotid artery stenosis surgery if collateral circulation fails to function appropriately. We predicted the statistics of the postoperative flow rate increase in the CoW, which is a measure of CH, considering the uncertainties of arterial diameters, stenosis parameters, and flow rates measured using the patients clinical data. A sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify the impact of each uncertain parameter on the flow rate increase. Results indicated that CH occurred when two conditions were satisfied simultaneously: severe stenosis and when arteries of small diameter serve as the collateral pathway to the cerebral artery on the stenosis side. These findings elucidate the biological aspects of cerebral circulation in terms of the relationship between collateral flow and CH.\n\nAuthor summaryCerebral arteries generate a ring-like network that provides alternative routes for blood supply in the case of carotid artery stenosis. This collateral circulation is closely associated with the potential risk of stroke and treatment outcomes in patients with stenosis. In this study, we propose a method to elucidate the cerebral circulation of individual patients using a blood flow simulation that incorporates the patients clinical data. A key feature of our approach is its capability to obtain the probability of the different outputs using simulation, considering the uncertainty of patient conditions. Although this capability is essential for obtaining reliable results, the process is time-consuming and requires numerous computer resources. We solved this problem by combining the blood flow simulation with machine learning to perform predictions 43 000 times faster than conventional simulations. We applied the proposed method to predict cerebral circulation following surgery in three patients with stenosis and verified that the method can assess the surgical risk almost in real-time, even on a desktop computer. Additionally, extensive prediction results (100 000 cases for each patient) obtained using this method clarify the relationship between collateral circulation and life-threatening surgical outcomes.",

PARP1 and PARP2 (PARP1/2) recognize damaged DNA and recruit the DNA repair machinery. Using single molecule microscopy in live cells, we monitored the movement of PARP1/2 on undamaged and damaged chromatin. We identify two classes of freely diffusing PARP1/2 and two classes of bound PARP1/2. The majority (> 60%) of PARP1/2 diffuse freely in both undamaged and damaged nuclei and in the presence of inhibitors of PARP1/2 used for cancer therapy (PARPi). Laser induced DNA damage results in a small fraction of slowly diffusing PARP1 and PARP2 to become transiently bound. Treatment of cells with PARPi in the presence of DNA damage causes subtle changes in the dynamics of bound PARP1/2, in contrast to bulk studies that suggest PARP trapping. Our results imply that next-generation PARPi could specifically target the small fraction of DNA-bound PARP1/2.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) regulates cardiac contractility by slowing shortening velocity and sensitizing the thin filament to calcium. cMyBP-C has been shown to interact with the proximal myosin S2 tail and the thin filament. However, the relative contribution of these interactions to the collective modulation of actomyosin ensemble function remains unclear. Hence, we developed a \"nanosurf\" assay as a model system to interrogate cMyBP-C interactions with actin and/or myosin. Synthetic thick filaments were generated using recombinant human {beta}-cardiac myosin subfragments (HMM or S1) attached to DNA nanotubes, with 14 or 28 nm spacing, corresponding to the 14.3 nm myosin spacing found in native thick filaments. In vitro motility assays with myosin bound to the surrounding surface, exhibit enhanced thin filament interactions with synthetic thick filaments. No significant differences were observed in mean thin filament velocities between 14 and 28 nm spacing, consistent with our previous results for myosin V, VI, and {beta}-cardiac myosin S1. Our nanosurf assay demonstrates the slowing of actomyosin motility by cMyBP-C. Alternating {beta}-cardiac myosin HMM and cMyBP-C N-terminal fragments, C0-C2 or C1-C2, every 14 nm on the nanotube, reduced the mean thin filament velocity 4-6 fold relative to myosin alone. Interestingly, similar inhibition was observed using a {beta}-cardiac myosin S1 construct, which lacks the S2 region proposed to interact with cMyBP-C, suggesting the actin-cMyBP-C interactions may dominate the inhibitory mechanism. No significant inhibition of thin filament velocity was observed with a C0-C1f fragment, lacking the majority of the M-domain, supporting the importance of this domain for inhibitory interaction(s). A phosphomimetic C0-C2 fragment showed a 3-fold higher velocity compared to its phosphonull counterpart, further highlighting phosphorylation-dependent regulation via the M-domain. Together, we have established the nanosurf assay as a tool to precisely manipulate spatially dependent cMyBP-C binding partner interactions, shedding light on the molecular regulation of {beta}-cardiac myosin contractility.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is the most frequently mutated protein associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common cause of sudden cardiac death. Despite the importance of cMyBP-C in cardiac contractility, the mechanisms underlying this regulation are unclear due to experimental challenges in studying the complex, transient, weak interactions of cMyBP-C with the contractile proteins of the sarcomere. In this study, we created a nanosurf synthetic DNA thick filament assay to dissect the cMyBP-C interactions with actin and human {beta}-cardiac myosin. We demonstrate actomyosin inhibition by cMyBP-C fragments regardless of recombinant human {beta}-cardiac myosin subfragment (HMM or S1) and highlight the importance of the cMyBP-C M-domain using cMyBP-C fragments and phosphomimetics.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRs) are non-coding RNA-molecules that regulate gene expression. Global circulating miR (c-miR) expression patterns (c-miRnome) change with carcinogenesis in various sporadic cancers. Therefore, aberrantly expressed c-miRs could have diagnostic, predictive and prognostic potential in molecular profiling of cancers. c-miR functions in carriers of inherited pathogenic mismatch-repair gene variants (path_MMR), also known as Lynch syndrome (LS), have remained understudied. LS cohort provides an ideal population for biomarker mining due to increased lifelong cancer risk and excessive cancer occurrence. Using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic approaches, we conducted an exploratory analysis to characterize systemic c-miRnomes of path_MMR carriers. Our discovery cohort included 81 healthy path_MMR carriers and 37 non-LS controls. Our analysis also included cancer cohort comprised of 13 path_MMR carriers with varying cancers and 24 sporadic rectal cancer patients. We showed for the first time that c-miRnome can discern healthy path_MMR carriers from non-LS controls but does not distinguish healthy path_MMR carriers from cancer patients with or without path_MMR. Our c-miR expression analysis combined with in silico tools suggest ongoing alterations of biological pathways shared in LS and sporadic carcinogenesis. We observed that these alterations can produce a c-miR signature which can be used to track oncogenic stress in cancer-free path_MMR carriers. Thus, c-miRs hold potential in monitoring which cancer patients would require more intensive surveillance or clinical management.\n\nSignificanceC-miRnome can discern between healthy persons with or without path_MMR but does not distinguish healthy path_MMR carriers from cancer patients with or without path_MMR, indicating an ongoing alteration of biological pathways that can be used to track oncogenic stress at cancer-free state.",

    "abstract": "The complex physiology and anatomy of the lungs and the range of processes involved in pulmonary drug transport and disposition make it challenging to predict the fate of orally inhaled drugs. This study aimed to develop an integrated computational pharmacology approach to mechanistically describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of inhaled drugs in both systemic circulation and site-specific lung tissue. The model included all the physiologically relevant pulmonary processes, such as deposition, dissolution, transport across lung barriers, and mucociliary clearance, to predict the inhaled drug pharmacokinetics. For validation test cases, the model predicted the fate of orally inhaled budesonide (highly soluble, mildly lipophilic) and fluticasone propionate (practically insoluble, highly lipophilic) in healthy subjects for: i) systemic and site-specific lung retention profiles, ii) aerodynamic particle size-dependent deposition profiles, and iii) identified the most impactful drug-specific, formulation-specific, and system-specific property factors that impact the fate of both the pulmonary and systemic concentration of the drugs. In summary, the presented multiscale computational model can guide the design of orally inhaled drug products to target specific lung areas, identify the effects of product differences on lung and systemic pharmacokinetics, and be used to better understand bioequivalence of generic orally inhaled drug products.\n\nAuthor summaryDespite widespread use of available orally inhaled drug products (OIDPs), much is unknown regarding their optimal lung deposition, targeted delivery to specific lung regions, and the effects of various device, formulation, and physiological factors on deposition, absorption, transport, and clearance. In this study, we have presented a multiscale computational framework that integrates a full-scale 24 generation 3D lung model with distinct barrier regions spanning trachea, tracheobronchial, alveolar, and the terminal alveolar sacs with multiple other modules to track the OIDP levels (concentration) in both blood and pulmonary tissue regions. Along with validating the framework on two different inhaled drug types, we have also presented a sensitivity analysis to highlight the most impactful drug and formulation parameters, and therefore, potential optimization parameters to modulate lung selectivity and to better understand the pulmonary retention of drugs in distinct lung regions.",

    "abstract": "PHO1 proteins play a central role in plant inorganic phosphorus translocation and sensing. The maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) genome encodes two co-orthologs of the Arabidopsis PHO1 gene, designated ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b. Here, we report the characterization of the transposon-footprint allele Zmpho1;2a-m1.1, which we refer to hereafter as pho1;2a. The pho1;2a allele is a stable derivative formed by excision of an Activator element from the ZmPho1;2a gene. The pho1;2a allele contains an 8 bp insertion at the point of excision that disrupts the reading frame and is predicted to generate a premature translational stop. We show that the pho1;2a allele is linked to a dosage-dependent reduction in transcript accumulation and a mild reduction in seedling growth that is enhanced under nutrient deficient conditions. Characterization of the shoot and root transcriptomes of seedlings segregating the pho1;2a mutation under different nutrient conditions revealed pho1;2a to have a dominant effect on patterns of transcript accumulation. Gene set enrichment analysis of the transcripts mis-regulated in pho1;2a mutants suggests that Pho1;2a functions in the fine-tuning of the transcriptional phosphate starvation response. We discuss our results with reference to possible genetic redundancy among maize Pho1 genes and in the context of reports linking functional variation in Pho1;2a to agronomically important traits.",

    "abstract": "Diatoms are a group of microalgae that are important primary producers in a range of open ocean, freshwater and intertidal environments. The latter can experience significant long- and short-term variability in temperature, from seasonal variations to rapid temperature shifts caused by tidal immersion and emersion. As temperature is a major determinant in the distribution of diatom species, their temperature sensory and response mechanisms likely have important roles in their ecological success. We have examined the mechanisms diatoms use to sense rapid changes in temperature, such as those experienced in the intertidal zone. We find that the diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana exhibit a transient cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) elevation in response to rapid cooling, similar to those observed in plant and animal cells. However, [Ca2+]cyt elevations were not observed in response to rapid warming. The kinetics and magnitude of cold-induced [Ca2+]cyt elevations correlate with the rate of temperature decrease. We do not find a role for the [Ca2+]cyt elevations in enhancing cold tolerance, but show that cold shock induces a Ca2+-dependent K+ efflux and reduces mortality of P. tricornutum during a simultaneous hypo-osmotic shock. As inter-tidal diatom species may routinely encounter simultaneous cold and hypo-osmotic shocks during tidal cycles, we propose that cold-induced Ca2+ signalling interacts with osmotic signalling pathways to aid in the regulation of cell volume. Our findings provide insight into the nature of temperature perception in diatoms and highlight that cross-talk between signalling pathways may play an important role in their cellular responses to multiple simultaneous stressors.",

    "abstract": "The cortical motor cells (CMCs) in a legume pulvinus execute the reversible deformation in leaf movement that is driven by changes in turgor pressure. In contrast to the underlying osmotic regulation proper, the cell wall structure of CMCs that contributes to the movement has yet to be characterized in detail. Here, we report that the cell wall of CMCs has circumferential slits with low levels of cellulose deposition. This structure is unique and distinct from that of any other primary cell walls reported so far; thus, we named them \"pulvinar slits.\" Notably, we predominantly detected de-methyl-esterified homogalacturonan inside pulvinar slits, with a low deposition of highly methyl-esterified homogalacturonan, as with cellulose. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that the cell wall composition of pulvini is different from that of other axial organs, such as petioles or stems. Moreover, monosaccharide analysis showed that pulvini are pectin-rich organs like developing stems and that the amount of galacturonic acid in pulvini is greater than in developing stems. Computer modeling suggested that pulvinar slits facilitate anisotropic extension in the direction perpendicular to the slits in the presence of turgor pressure. When tissue slices of CMCs were transferred to different extracellular osmotic conditions, pulvinar slits altered their opening width, indicating their deformability. In this study, we thus characterized a distinctive cell wall structure of CMCs, adding new knowledge to repetitive and reversible organ deformation as well as the structural diversity and function of the plant cell wall.",

    "abstract": "rRNA depletion is the most expensive step in prokaryotic RNA-seq library preparation. rRNA is so abundant that small increases in depletion efficiency lead to large changes in mRNA sequencing coverage. A variety of commercial and home-made methods exist to lower the cost or increase the efficiency of rRNA removal. Many of these techniques are suboptimal when applied to new species of bacteria or when the protocol or reagents need to be changed. Re-optimizing a protocol by trial-and-error is an expensive and laborious process. Systematic frameworks like the statistical design of experiments (DOE) can improve processes by exploring the quantitative relationship between multiple factors. DOE allows experimenters to find factor interactions that may not be apparent when factors are studied in isolation.\n\nWe used DOE to optimize an rRNA depletion protocol by updating reagents and identifying factors that maximize rRNA removal and minimize cost. The optimized protocol more efficiently removes rRNA, uses fewer reagents, and is less expensive than the original protocol. Our optimization required only 17 experiments and identified two significant interactions among three factors. Overall, our approach demonstrates the utility of a rational, DOE framework for improving complex protocols.",

    "abstract": "The Pekin duck was domesticated between 4000 and 10,000 years ago from the Mallard duck and is the predominate meat type duck in the world (Cherry and Morris, 2008). The global production of waterfowl is a rapidly growing industry. Total meat duck production increased from 2.9 million tons in 2000 to nearly 4.4 million tons in 2013, a growth rate of 3.2% per year, and further increased to 7.2 million tons in 2018, and valued at $19B in 2019 (IndexBox, 2019). Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchus domesticus) are the fastest growing poultry species growing from hatch to 4.5 kg market weight in as little as 28 days (Blois et al., 2019; Campbell et al., 2015; Cherry and Morris, 2008). Thus, there is a need to study the growth and reproduction of this economically important species. While Pekin duck biology is being explored by many researchers, there are fewer molecular tools available for duck compared to other poultry species and many fewer compared to mammalian systems. For example, one molecular tool commonly used to interrogate other systems are adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. AAV vectors are being utilized by many researchers to deliver transgenes to target tissues or cells and for genetic manipulation. Recently, avian adeno-associated virus (A3V) has been used to deliver genes to the cells and neurons of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). Here, we show that A3V can be used to deliver genes to Pekin duck neurons and cells in culture. Together, these results suggest that A3V will be a useful molecular tool in Pekin duck research.\n\nSummary StatementHere we demonstrate the use of viral vectors to deliver transgenes to Pekin duck cells. These vectors can be used to advance understanding of reproduction in this economically important species.",

However, progress is scant for most insect groups due to shortfalls in distribution and phylogenetic information, namely Wallacean and Darwinian shortfalls respectively. Here, we used the western Palearctic ants as the case to tackle these shortfalls and test their biogeographic structure through novel distribution data and phylogenetic approaches.\n\nLocationWestern Palearctic realm.\n\nTaxonAnts (Formicidae).\n\nMethodsFirstly, we developed a refined database integrating the occurrences of 747 ant species across 207 regions of the western Palearctic realm, based on newly expert-validated records derived from the existing global ant biodiversity informatics. Using range estimates for these species derived from polygons and species distribution modelling, we produced species assemblages in 50 x 50 km grid cells. We calculated taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover of ant assemblages, performing hierarchical clustering analysis using the Simpson dissimilarity index to delineate biogeographic structure.\n\nResultsAt both the regional list- and grid assemblage-levels, the Mediterranean has higher turnover and more biogeographic regions than northern Europe, both taxonomically and phylogenetically. Delineations based on grid assemblages detected more detailed biogeographic transitions, while those based on regional lists showed stronger insularity in biogeographic structure. The phylogenetic regionalization suggested closer but varied affinities between assemblages in comparison to the taxonomic approach.\n\nMain conclusionsHere, we integrated expert-validated regional lists, species distribution modelling, and a recent phylogeny to tackle Wallacean and Darwinian shortfalls for an important insect group by developing a next-generation map of biogeographic regionalization for the western Palearctic ants. The results of this study suggest strong constraints from geographic barriers and potential effects of climatic history on ant distributions and evolutionary history, and also provide baseline spatial information for future investigations of regional insect distributions.",

    "abstract": "SFPQ is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that is involved in a wide range of physiological processes including neuronal development and homeostasis. However, the mislocalization and cytoplasmic aggregation of SFPQ are associated with the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have previously reported that zinc mediates SFPQ polymerization and promotes the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates in neurons. Here we characterize two familial ALS (fALS)-associated SFPQ variants, which cause amino acid substitutions in the proximity of the SFPQ zinc-coordinating center (N533H and L534I). Both mutants display increased zinc-binding affinities, which can be explained by the presence of a secondary zinc-binding site revealed by the 1.83[A] crystal structure of the human SFPQ L534I mutant. Overexpression of these fALS-associated mutants significantly increases the number of SFPQ cytoplasmic aggregates in primary neurons. Although they do not affect the density of dendritic spines, the presence of SFPQ cytoplasmic aggregates causes a marked reduction in the levels of the GluA1, but not the GluA2 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors on the neuronal surface. Taken together, our data demonstrate that fALS-associated mutations enhance the propensity of SFPQ to bind zinc and form aggregates, leading to the dysregulation of AMPA receptor subunit composition, which may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in ALS.",

The \"success,\" or genome-wide abundance, of TEs differs widely between species. Deciphering the causes for this large variety in TE abundance has remained a central question in evolutionary genomics. We previously proposed that species-specific TE abundance could be driven by the inadvertent consequences of host-direct epigenetic silencing of TEs--the spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from silenced TEs into adjacent sequences. Here, we compared this TE-mediated \"epigenetic effect\" in six species in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup to dissect step-by-step the role of such effect in determining genomic TE abundance.\n\nWe found that TE-mediated spreading of repressive marks is prevalent and substantially varies across and even within species. While this TE-mediated effect alters the epigenetic states of adjacent genes, we surprisingly discovered that the transcription of neighboring genes could reciprocally impact this spreading. Importantly, our multi- species analysis provides the power and appropriate phylogenetic resolution to connect species-specific host chromatin regulation, TE-mediated epigenetic effects, the strength of natural selection against TEs, and genomic TE abundance unique to individual species. Our findings point towards the importance of host chromatin landscapes in shaping genome evolution through the epigenetic effects of a selfish genetic parasite.",

Targeting of downstream mediators of c-Myc, such as the  cyclin-like cell cycle regulator Spy1, may be a viable therapeutic option in a subset of breast cancer subtypes.\n\nMethodsMouse mammary tumour cells isolated from MMTV-Myc mice and human breast cancer cell lines were used to manipulate Spy1 levels followed by tamoxifen or chemotherapeutic treatment with a variety of endpoints. Patient samples from TNBC patients were obtained and constructed into a TMA and stained for c-Myc and Spy1 protein levels.\n\nResultsOver time, MMTV-Myc cells show a decreased response to tamoxifen treatment with increasing levels of Spy1 in the tamoxifen-resistant cells. shRNA against Spy1 re-establishes tamoxifen sensitivity. Spy1 was found to be highly elevated in human TNBC cell and patient samples, correlating to c-Myc protein levels. c-Myc was found to be stabilized by Spy1 and knocking down Spy1 in TNBC cells shows a significant increase in response to chemotherapy treatments.\n\nConclusionsUnderstanding the interplay between protein expression level and response to treatment is a critical factor in developing novel treatment options for breast cancer patients. These data have shown a connection between Spy1 and c-Myc protein levels in more aggressive breast cancer cells and patient samples. Furthermore, targeting c-Myc has proven difficult, these data suggest targeting Spy1 even when c-Myc is elevated can confer an advantage to current chemotherapies.",

The heterozygous ATR-I774Yfs*5 mutation, the result of strand slippage in a poly-A tract of the Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) gene, is overexpressed in MMR-defective malignancies including colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and is the most common ATR mutation in cancer. Here, we explore the contribution of ATR-I774Yfs*5 to genomic integrity. Using heterozygous ATR-I774Yfs*5 HCT-116 cells to mimic the native mutation, we found this mutation reduced ATR activity as measured by damage-induced Chk1 phosphorylation at S317 and ATR autophosphorylation ATR at T1989. ATR-I774Yfs*5 expression impaired genomic stability as visualized by the appearance of micronuclei in two stable expression models as well as in cell lines transfected with ATR-I774Yfs*5. Micronucleus development was dependent on replication and independent of ATR copy number. ATR-I774Yfs*5 expression did not alter cellular viability, cell cycle progression, or replicative rate, suggesting this mutation is well-tolerated despite its destabilizing effect on the genome.

    "abstract": "The taxonomic status of the zooplanktivorous cichlids Copadichromis mloto and C. virginalis has been confused since their original descriptions by lles in 1960. While two forms of C. virginalis, Kaduna and Kajose, were distinguished in the type material, C. mloto has not been positively identified since its original description. Here we re-examined the types as well as 54 recently collected specimens from multiple sampling locations. Genome sequencing of 51 recent specimens revealed two closely related but reciprocally monophyletic clades. Geometric morphological analysis indicated that one clade morphologically encompasses the type specimens of C. virginalis identified by Iles as the  Kaduna form, including the holotype, while the other clade encompasses not only the paratypes identified as the  Kajose form, but also the type series of C. mloto. Given that all three forms have the same type locality, that there are no meristic or character states to differentiate them and that there are no records of adult male C. mloto in breeding colours, we conclude that the  Kajose form previously identified as C. virginalis represents relatively deeper bodied sexually active or maturing individuals of C. mloto.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are the resident immune cells of nervous system. In healthy conditions, microglia actively patrol neural tissues in a homeostatic state, which can rapidly change to an activated state in response to local injury/disease. Dysregulated microglia activation is a hallmark of disorders and diseases of the nervous system, including motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The elucidation of the roles of microglia in human biology and disease has recently benefitted from the development of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based approaches to generate microglia-like cells. Microglia represent a heterogeneous group of cells with spatial diversity in both health and disease. This situation poses a considerable challenge along the path towards establishing the most pathologically-relevant human iPSC-derived microglia preparations to investigate the complex roles of microglia in ALS and other neurological diseases. The success of these approaches must account for microglia diversity in different regions of the brain and spinal cord. In this study, we compared the transcriptomes of human iPSC-derived microglia generated using different methods to determine whether or not separate strategies can be used to generate microglia with distinct transcriptional signatures in vitro. We show that microglia derived using two different methods display distinct in vitro maturation characteristics. We also reveal that different derivation methods give rise to preparations comprising human microglia with distinct transcriptomic signatures resembling the gene profiles of specific microglia subpopulations in vivo. These findings suggest that a careful, and coordinated, implementation of multiple microglia differentiation methods from human iPSCs can be an effective approach towards the goal of generating multiple microglia subtypes that will offer enhanced model systems to account for microglia heterogeneity in vivo. Spatially-defined human iPSC-derived microglia would represent an enhanced tool to study the multiple levels of involvement of microglia in mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS, as well as other neurological diseases and disorders.",

    "abstract": "Clinical evidence has linked increased peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, whether inflammation contributes to or is a consequence of PTSD is still unclear. Previous research shows that stress can activate P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) on microglia to induce inflammation and behavioral changes. In this investigation, we examined whether P2X7Rs contribute to the development of PTSD-like behaviors induced by single prolonged stress (SPS) exposure in rats. Consistent with the literature, exposing adult male and female rats to SPS produced a PTSD-like phenotype of impaired fear extinction and increased anxiety-like behavior one week after exposure. In addition, SPS-exposed animals had more Iba1-positive microglia expressing the P2X7R in the ventral hippocampus, a structure that regulates fear extinction and anxiety-like behavior. Next, we examined if inflammation precedes the behavioral manifestations. Three days after SPS exposure, increased inflammatory cytokines were found in the blood and hippocampal microglia showed increased expression of the P2X7R, IL-1{beta}, and TNF-, suggesting increased peripheral and central inflammation before behavioral testing. To determine whether P2X7Rs contribute to the PTSD-related behaviors induced by SPS exposure, we gave ICV infusions of the P2X7R antagonist, A-438079, for one week starting the day of SPS exposure. Blocking P2X7Rs prevented the SPS-induced impaired fear extinction and increased anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats, suggesting that SPS activates P2X7Rs which increase inflammation to produce a PTSD-like phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect inflammation and immunity in a multitude of ways, in particular in the context of the signaling pathways that determine cell fate. Inflammasomes are multiprotein cytoplasmic complexes whose pyroptosis-inducing activities are controlled by ROS. Our knowledge of how ROS mediates inflammasome activities is largely based on studies of the initiating events in these pathways. Herein, we show that ROS controls the terminal events in the pyroptosis pathways. We found that ROS oxidizes the protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) and promotes its assembly into a death-inducing pore forming complex. Mechanistically, ROS enhances GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in an intrinsic manner, likely through oxidative modification of a specific cysteine residue (C192). Diverse ROS sources promote GSDMD oxidation, ranging from homeostatic control via the Ragulator-Rag complex, to inducible control via diverse microbial products and environmental toxins. These findings expand the steps in the inflammasome pathway that are controlled by ROS and suggest that GSDMD operates as a pyroptosis-inducing redox sensor.",

    "abstract": "Microbes rely on signal transduction systems to sense and respond to environmental changes for survival and reproduction. It is generally known that niche adaptation plays an important role in shaping the signaling repertoire. However, the evolution of bacterial signaling capacity lacks systematic studies with a temporal direction. Particularly, it is unclear how complexity evolved from simplicity or vice versa for signaling networks. Here we examine the evolutionary processes of major signal transduction systems in Campylobacterota (formerly Epsilonproteobacteria), a phylum with sufficient evolutionary depth and ecological diversity. Evolution of signaling systems within Campylobacterota shows two opposite trends. During niche expansion, signaling complexity increases with gene expansions through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), gene duplication, fusion and fission, which create opportunities for genetic innovation and pathway integration. In contrast, as the lineages adapt to a specialized niche, complexity decreases with massive gene losses that lead to the decline or disappearance of pathways mediated by multiple transmitters. Overall, signaling capacity and complexity arise and drop together in Campylobacterota, determined by sensory demand, genetic resources and co-evolution within the genomic context. These findings reflects plausible evolutionary principles for other cellular networks and genome evolution of the Bacteria domain.",

    "abstract": "Insulin is an essential hormone made by the pancreatic beta-cells in the islets of Langerhans. Beta-cells produce more insulin protein than virtually all other cellular proteins combined. Dysfunction in the process of insulin synthesis can lead to disease, including rare forms of monogenic diabetes. Specifically, aberrant intra-insulin and inter-insulin disulphide bonds have been implicated in the pathology of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In type 1 diabetes, misprocessed insulin isoforms may be neoepitopes that kick-start and/or exacerbate the auto-immune response. In type 2 diabetes, aberrant disulphides form insulin dimers that can clog the endoplasmic reticulum and contribute to beta cell dysfunction. To facilitate the study of novel and known insulin neoepitopes and dimers, we present an unbiased and rapid technique for identifying insulin disulphide patterns from pancreatic islet extracts. The basis of this method is the cleavage between insulins cysteine residues with the metalloprotease, thermolysin, and subsequent identification of cysteine containing fragments and their partner peptides by LC-MS/MS. Using this technique, we identify 6 aberrant disulphide bonded insulin species, including a previously described type 1 diabetes neoepitope, as well as inter-chain disulphide bonded insulin dimers. Furthermore, using the endoplasmic stress inducer, thapsigargin, we observe increased disulphide errors in a patient donor sample. This approach lays foundations to identify the scope and cause of aberrant insulin disulphide formation in health and disease.",

Extensive optimization of reagent delivery and nuclease activity have improved genome editing workflows, but comparatively few efforts have been made to alter the gene editing activity of template molecules. Here, we report template DNA modified with interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) - xHDRTs - increases editing frequencies in Cas9-directed gene editing workflows by up to five-fold. xHDRTs increase gene editing frequencies independent of DNA template topology, amount of sequence added, or cell type. Gene editing using xHDRTs requires the DNA repair kinase, ATR, and partially requires Fanconi Anemia proteins, including FANCA, but is independent of other ICL-repair pathways. Covalent modification of donor DNA thus presents a compelling opportunity to improve nonviral gene editing workflows.",

    "abstract": "Steroid hormone signaling is a central regulator of insect development especially during the post-embryonic period. However, its role during embryonic development is less understood, particularly in short-germ band hemimetabolous insects. Here, we used the short-germ band hemimetabolous insect Blattella germanica to analyse the functions of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), the most active insect steroid, signaling during the embryonic stage. We show that the heterodimeric 20E receptor, BgEcR-A and BgRXR, is present from the beginning of embryogenesis and that a stereotypical 20E-dependent cascade of nuclear receptors is first detected at the early blastoderm stage. Using parental RNAi, we show that both receptors are required for the proper formation of the germ band by controlling cell proliferation during the blastoderm stage. In addition, they are also required for the coordinated induction of the 20E-induced cascade of nuclear receptors. Finally, we show that two of these nuclear receptors, BgHR3 and BgFTZ-F1, have relevant roles in germ band formation. Whereas BgHR3 controls the formation and development of the cephalic region of the germ band, BgFTZ-F1 stripped expression suggested a role in the segmentation of the germ band. In summary, our results show that 20E-signaling is required much earlier in short-germ band hemimetabolous than in long-germ band holometabolous embryogenesis, which raises the possibility that the loss of 20E-signaling during the initial stages of embryogenesis could be a key feature in the evolution of the different types of insect development.",

    "abstract": "Benefits of invasive species management for terrestrial biodiversity are widely expected and promoted in New Zealand. Evidence for this is presented in policy and scientific reviews of the literature, but the robustness and repeatability of the underpinning evidence-base remains poorly understood. We evaluated the design of field-based studies assessing biodiversity responses to invasive species management in 155 peer-reviewed articles published across 46 journals from 2010 - 2019. Each study was assessed against nine principles of experimental design, covering robustness of sampling and avoidance of bias. These principles are important in New Zealand to detect treatment effects from environmental variability driven by underlying gradients such as soil fertility, climate and disturbance. Fifty two percent of studies defined a sampling universe and 68% of studies specified the treatment. Whereas, 54%, 74%, and 50% of studies did not utilise replication, representatively sample the universe, or quantify invasive species, respectively. Ninety five percent of studies quantified biodiversity responses, although a high proportion of these did not representatively sample replicates. Initial conditions and accounting for effects of experimental implementation were not utilised in 57% and 84% of studies respectively. No studies avoided observer/analyst bias using blinding methods, despite this being widely adopted in other fields. Ordinal logistic regression showed these principles varied in how robustly they were applied among categories of biodiversity responses and invasive species. Our findings suggest that greater attention to experimental design principles is desirable: supported by researchers, funding agencies, reviewers, and journal editors. Greater resources is not necessarily a solution to these design issues. Undertaking fewer studies, that are individually more expensive because they better adhere to experimental design principles, is one alternative. Our intent in this article is to improve the robustness of future field studies for at least some principles. Robust designs have enduring value, reduce uncertainty and increase our understanding of when, where and how often the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity are indeed reversible.",

    "abstract": "The transition in Mysticeti (Cetacea) from capture of individual prey using teeth to bulk filtering batches of small prey using baleen ranks among the most dramatic evolutionary transformations in mammalian history. We review phylogenetic work on the homology of mysticete feeding structures from anatomical, ontogenetic, and genomic perspectives. Six characters with key functional significance for filter-feeding behavior are mapped to cladograms based on 11 morphological datasets to reconstruct evolutionary change across the teeth-to-baleen transition. This comparative summary within a common parsimony framework reveals extensive conflicts among independent systematic efforts but also broad support for the newly named clade Kinetomenta (Aetiocetidae + Chaeomysticeti). Complementary anatomical studies using CTscans and ontogenetic series hint at commonalities between the developmental programs for teeth and baleen, lending further support for a  transitional chimaeric feeder scenario that best explains current knowledge on the transition to filter feeding. For some extant mysticetes, the ontogenetic sequence in fetal specimens recapitulates the inferred evolutionary transformation: from teeth, to teeth and baleen, to just baleen. Phylogenetic mapping of inactivating mutations reveals mutational decay of  dental genes related to enamel formation before the emergence of crown Mysticeti, while  baleen genes that were repurposed or newly derived during the evolutionary elaboration of baleen currently are poorly characterized. Review and meta-analysis of available data suggest that the teeth-to-baleen transition in Mysticeti ranks among the best characterized macroevolutionary shifts due to the diversity of data from the genome, the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and ontogeny that directly bears on this remarkable evolutionary transformation.",

    "abstract": "As a major origin of evolutionary novelties, gene duplication is a widespread phenomenon across species. However, the evolutionary force that determines the fate of duplicate genes is still under debate. Here, we studied the functional evolution of duplicate genes at both macroevolution and microevolution scales using the genomic sequences of eleven Caenorhabditis species and 773 C. elegans wild isolates. We found that compared to older duplicate genes and single-copy genes, recently duplicated gene copies showed rapid turnover, large genetic diversity, and signs of balancing and positive selection within the species. Young duplicate genes have low basal expression restricted to a few tissues but show highly responsive expression towards pathogenic infections. Recently duplicated genes are enriched in chemosensory perception, protein degradation, and innate immunity, implicating their functions in enhancing adaptability to external perturbations. Importantly, we found that young duplicate genes are rarely essential, while old duplicate genes have the same level of essentiality as singletons, suggesting that essentiality develops over a long time. Together, our work in C. elegans demonstrates that natural selection shapes the dynamic evolutionary trajectory of duplicate genes.\n\nSignificanceThe \"evolution by gene duplication\" theory suggests that gene duplications provide the genetic materials for mutation and selection to act upon, expand the repertoire of molecular functions, and enable evolutionary novelty. Although various models were proposed to describe the fate of duplicate genes, empirical evidence for these models is limited. We analyzed gene duplications in eleven nematode Caenorhabditis species and studied the intraspecific variation of these duplicate genes among C. elegans wild strains. We found that compared to older duplicate gens and single-copy genes, recently duplicated genes show rapid turnover, large genetic diversity, and strong signs of balancing and positive selection but rarely develop essential functions. Our results describe the evolutionary trajectory of duplicate genes shaped by natural selection.",

    "abstract": "Cytonuclear coevolution is a common feature among plants, which coordinates gene expression and protein products between the nucleus and organelles. Consequently, lineage-specific differences may result in incompatibilities between the nucleus and cytoplasm in hybrid taxa. Allopolyploidy is also a common phenomenon in plant evolution. The hybrid nature of allopolyploids may result in cytonuclear incompatibilities, but the massive nuclear redundancy created during polyploidy affords additional avenues for resolving cytonuclear conflict (i.e., cytonuclear accommodation). Here we evaluate expression changes in organelle-targeted nuclear genes for six allopolyploid lineages that represent four genera (i.e., Arabidopsis, Arachis, Chenopodium, and Gossypium) and encompass a range in polyploid ages. Because incompatibilities between the nucleus and cytoplasm could potentially result in biases toward the maternal homoeolog and/or maternal expression level, we evaluate patterns of homoeolog usage, expression bias, and expression level dominance in cytonuclear genes relative to the background of non-cytonuclear expression changes and to the diploid parents. Although we find subsets of cytonuclear genes in most lineages that match our expectations of maternal preference, these observations are not consistent among either allopolyploids or categories of organelle-targeted genes. Our results indicate that cytonuclear expression accommodation may be a subtle and/or variable phenomenon that does not capture the full range of mechanisms by which allopolyploid plants resolve nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibilities.",

We confirm a previously mapped sex-independent effect of initial locomotor responses to morphine (50 mg/kg ip) that maps precisely to Oprm1 on chromosome (Chr) 10, with the linkage score reaching -log10P of ~12.4 (with a high B allele) at 75 min and exhausted by 160 min. We detected a new modulator of opiate locomotor activation in both sexes on Chr 16, with a peak linkage that climbs from 105 through to 180 min after injection. This locus includes one compelling candidate--fibroblast growth factor 12 (Fgf12). We also detected a strong, but transient epistatic interaction between these two loci. Single nuclei transcriptomic analyses in rats demonstrates that expression of Oprm1 and Fgf12 mRNA covary in one specific subtype of Drd1 medium spiny neurons. Our Bayesian network analysis identified that a cascade of MAP kinases--Mapk8ip2, Map3k11, and Map3k12--are part of the Oprm1-Fgf12 network. This is the first demonstration of a time-dependent epistatic interaction modulating drug response in mammals with interesting mechanistic implications. Analysis of OPRM1 and FGF12 gene networks in human GWAS data highlights enrichment of signals associated with substance use disorder.",

Many software tools have been developed to detect retained introns from short RNA-seq reads, but reliable detection is complicated by overlapping genes and transcripts as well as the presence of unprocessed or partially processed RNAs. We compared introns detected by 5 tools using short RNA-seq reads with introns observed in long RNA-seq reads from the same biological specimens and found: (1) significant disagreement among tools (Fleiss{kappa} = 0.231) such that 52.4% of all detected intron retentions were not called by more than one tool; (2) that no tool achieved greater than 20% precision or 35% recall under generous conditions; and (3) that retained intron detectability was adversely affected by greater intron length and overlap with annotated exons.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational methylation of proteins, which occurs in arginines and lysines, modulates several biological processes at different levels of cell signaling. Recently, methylation has been demonstrated in the regulation beyond histones, for example, in the dynamics of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. However, the presence and role of non-histone methylation in Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, has not yet been elucidated. Here, we applied mass spectrometry-based-proteomics (LC-MS/MS) to describe the methylproteome of T. cruzi epimastigotes. A total of 1253 methyl sites in 824 methylated proteins were identified, of these, 712 (86.4%) proteins were identified in two or more biological replicates. Our results of functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction, and co-occurrence with other PTMs, show that protein methylation impacts different levels of biological processes, such translation, RNA and DNA binding, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, 171 methylated proteins were previously reported with phosphorylation sites in T. cruzi, including flagellar proteins and RNA binding proteins, indicating that there may be an interplay between these different modifications in non-histone proteins. Our results show that a broad spectrum of functions are affected by methylation indicating its potential to impact important processes in the biology of the parasite and other trypanosomes.\n\nStatement of the significanceTrypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans and faces different environmental changes throughout its life cycle. Protein methylation is an important post-translational modification by which cells respond and adapt to the environment. We applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics and reported the first proteomic analysis of arginine and lysine methylation in T. cruzi. Our data demonstrate that protein methylation is broad and impacts different cellular processes in T. cruzi. This study represents a significant advance in the investigation of the importance of protein methylation in trypanosomes.",

It involves a multi-step process, and multiple parameters and options that need to be tested and determined. In this article, we describe Snaq, a snakemake pipeline that helps automate and optimize 16S data analysis using QIIME2. Snaq offers an informative file naming system and automatically performs the analysis of a data set by downloading and installing the required databases and classifiers, all through a single command-line instruction. It works natively on Linux and Mac and on Windows through the use of containers, and is potentially extendable by adding new rules. This pipeline will substantially reduce the efforts in sending commands and prevent the confusion caused by the accumulation of analysis results due to testing multiple parameters.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches have been applied to identify transcription factor (TF)-DNA interaction important for gene regulation and expression. However, due to the enormous search space of the genome, it is challenging to build models capable of surveying entire reference genomes, especially in species where models were not trained. In this study, we surveyed a variety of methods for classification of epigenomics data in an attempt to improve the detection for 12 members of the Auxin Response Factor (ARF) binding DNAs from maize and soybean as assessed by DNA Affinity Purification and sequencing (DAP-seq). We used the classification for prediction by minimizing the genome search space by only surveying unmethylated regions (UMRs). For identification of DAP-seq binding events within the UMRs, we achieved 93.54% accuracy, 6.2% false positive, and a 43.29% false negative rate across 12 members of ARFs of maize on average by encoding DNA with count vectorization for k-mer with a logistic regression classifier with up-sampling and feature selection. Importantly, feature selection helps to uncover known and potentially novel ARF binding motifs. This demonstrates an independent method for identification of transcription factor binding sites. Finally, we tested the model built with maize DAP-seq data and applied it directly to the soybean genome and found unacceptably high false positive rates, which accounted for more than 40% across the ARF TFs tested. The findings in this study suggest the potential use of various methods to predict TF-DNA interactions within and between species with varying degrees of success.",

    "abstract": "Reversible transition between the epithelial and mesenchymal states are key aspects of carcinoma cell dissemination and the metastatic disease, and thus, characterizing the molecular basis of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial to find druggable targets and more effective therapeutic approaches in cancer. Emerging studies suggest that epigenetic regulators might endorse cancer cells with the cell plasticity required to conduct dynamic changes in cell state during EMT. However, epigenetic mechanisms involved remain mostly unknown. Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs) proteins are well-established epigenetic regulators of development and stem cell differentiation, but their role in different cancer systems is inconsistent and sometimes paradoxical. In this study, we have analysed the role of the PRC2 protein EZH2 in lung carcinoma cells. We found that besides its described role in CDKN2A-dependent cell proliferation, EZH2 upholds the epithelial state of cancer cells by repressing the transcription of hundreds of mesenchymal genes. Chemical inhibition or genetic removal of EZH2 promotes the residence of cancer cells in the mesenchymal state during reversible epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In fitting, analysis of human patient samples and tumour xenograft models indicate that EZH2 is required to efficiently repress mesenchymal genes and facilitate tumour colonization in vivo. Overall, this study discloses a novel role of PRC2 as a master regulator of EMT in carcinoma cells. This finding has important implications for the design of therapies based on EZH2 inhibitors in human cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII) is a major contributor to physiological and pathological glutamate-mediated Ca2+ signals, and its involvement in various critical cellular pathways demands specific pharmacological strategies. We recently presented GHB ligands as the first small molecules selectively targeting the CaMKII hub, a domain primarily responsible for holoenzyme oligomerisation, with an emerging functional role. Here, we report that the GHB ligand, HOCPCA, improves sensorimotor function after experimental stroke in mice when administered at clinically relevant time and in combination with alteplase. We observed that hub modulation by HOCPCA results in differential effects on distinct CaMKII pools, ultimately alleviating aberrant CaMKII signalling after cerebral ischemia. As such, HOCPCA normalised cytosolic Thr286 autophosphorylation after ischemia in mice and downregulated the ischemia-specific expression of a constitutively active CaMKII kinase fragment. Previous studies suggest holoenzyme stabilisation as a potential mechanism, yet a causal link to in vivo findings requires further studies. HOCPCAs selectivity and absence of effects on physiological CaMKII signalling highlight pharmacological modulation of the CaMKII hub domain as an attractive neuroprotective strategy.",

    "abstract": "AimTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) aims to supplement sensory feedback to improve force steadiness or motor function. In this study, we directly assessed potential changes in corticospinal excitability and motor unit discharge characteristics from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle due to TENS by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG).\n\nMethodsEleven healthy young adults performed a series of submaximal isometric index abductions. We estimated i) motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, ii) persistent inward current amplitudes (PIC, i.e., delta F), iii) motor unit recruitment thresholds and discharge rates, and iv) common synaptic input to motor units before and after TENS.\n\nResultsTENS did not affect force steadiness (2.5 {+/-} 0.9% and 3.3 {+/-} 1.9% (p = 0.010)). MEP amplitudes decreased at 110% of the resting motor threshold (rMT; 0.72 {+/-} 0.66 mV vs. 0.59 {+/-} 0.63 mV; p < 0.001), increased at 130% rMT (1.18 {+/-} 1.10 mV vs. 1.41 {+/-} 1.29 mV; p < 0.001). Delta F increased after TENS (3.7 {+/-} 2.2 pps vs. 4.5 {+/-} 2.6 pps; p = 0.010). We did not find a change in the level of common synaptic input or in the temporal variability of motor unit discharge rates after the session of TENS.\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that TENS can modulate corticospinal excitability through supraspinal and spinal processes and, thus act as a priming technique. At the same time, TENS does not generate short-term changes in the neural control of force in young, healthy adults.",

    "abstract": "Huanglongbing (HLB) causes significant economic loss in citrus production worldwide. HLB is caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), a gram-negative bacterium which inhabits the phloem exclusively. CLas infection results in accumulation of callose and reactive oxygen species in the phloem of infected plants, but little is known about the specific processes that take place during infection because of the sparse distribution of bacteria and the inaccessibility of the phloem inside the tree. In this study, we used the seed vasculatures, which accumulate a high number of CLas, as a model tissue to study CLas-host cellular interactions. In vasculature where CLas is abundant, sieve pore callose and H2O2 concentration were reduced compared to healthy seed vasculature. The expression of callose synthases (CalS) and respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH) genes were downregulated in infected seeds compared to healthy ones. In leaves of HLB-infected plants, H2O2 concentration and CalS expression increased compared to uninfected leaves, but cells with CLas had lower levels of sieve plate callose compared to cells without CLas. Our results provide evidence that the bacteria manipulate cell metabolism to disable plant defenses and suggests that HLB disease is the result of a constant arms-race between the pathogen and a defense response, which is ultimately harmful to the host plant.",
