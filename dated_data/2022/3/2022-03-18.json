    "abstract": "Iron is mostly devoted to the hemoglobinization of erythrocytes for oxygen transport. Yet, emerging evidence points to a broader role for the metal in hematopoiesis, including the formation of the immune system. Iron availability in mammalian cells is controlled by iron-regulatory proteins (IRP)-1 and -2. We report that global disruption of both IRP1 and IRP2 in adult mice impairs neutrophil development and differentiation in the bone marrow, yielding immature neutrophils with abnormally high glycolytic and autophagic activity, resulting in neutropenia. IRPs promote neutrophil differentiation in a cell intrinsic manner by securing cellular iron supply together with transcriptional control of neutropoiesis to facilitate differentiation to fully mature neutrophils. Unlike neutrophils, monocyte count was not affected by IRP and iron deficiency, suggesting a lineage-specific effect of iron on myeloid output. This study unveils the previously unrecognized importance of IRPs and iron metabolism in the formation of a major branch of the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "Minicollagens are major structural components in the biogenesis of nematocysts in Cnidaria. Sequence mining and recent proteomic analysis of polar capsules, homologues of cnidarian nematocysts, have confirmed the presence of minicollagens in this evolutionarily ancient cnidarian endoparasitic group. Nonetheless, the role of nematocyst-associated proteins in polar capsule morphogenesis has never been studied in myxozoans. Here, we report the gene expression of three myxozoan minicollagens, ncol-1, ncol-3, and the recently identified ncol-5, during the intrapiscine development of Myxidium lieberkuehni, the myxozoan parasite of Northern pike Esox lucius. Moreover, we determined the abundance and localisation of Ncol-1 and Ncol-5 proteins in the developing myxozoan stages by western blotting and by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. We found that expression of minicollagens was spatiotemporally restricted to developing polar capsules in sporogonic stages. Intriguingly, Ncol-1 and Ncol-5 were localised as major components of the polar capsule wall and polar tubule. These results support the common origin of nematocysts and myxozoan polar capsules. Furthermore, our findings have practical implications for a more accurate identification of developmental stages of myxozoan parasites.",

    "abstract": "The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) depends on environmental and genetic factors. Among environmental factors, an imbalance in the gut microbiota can increase CRC risk. Also, microbiota is influenced by host genetics. However, it is not known if germline variants influence CRC development by modulating microbiota composition. We investigated germline variants associated with the abundance of bacterial populations in the normal (non-involved) colorectal mucosa of 93 CRC patients and evaluated their possible role in disease. Using a multivariable linear regression, we assessed the association between germline variants identified by genome wide genotyping and bacteria abundances determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\n\nWe identified 37 germline variants associated with the abundance of the genera Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium and Gemmiger and with alpha diversity. These variants are correlated with the expression of 58 genes involved in inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, apoptosis and barrier integrity. Genes and bacteria appear to be involved in the same processes. In fact, expression of the pro-inflammatory genes GAL, GSDMD and LY6H was correlated with the abundance of Bacteroides, which has pro-inflammatory properties; abundance of the anti-inflammatory genus Faecalibacterium correlated with expression of KAZN, with barrier-enhancing functions.\n\nBoth the microbiota composition and local inflammation are regulated, at least partially, by the same germline variants. These variants may regulate the microenvironment in which bacteria grow and predispose to the development of cancer. Identification of these variants is the first step to identifying higher-risk individuals and proposing tailored preventive treatments that increase beneficial bacterial populations.\n\nAuthors summaryGenetic variants describe the variation in the DNA sequence in our genomes and are unique for each person. These variants modify the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating genes that participate in CRC-associated mechanisms. CRC risk is also affected by microbiota (the microorganisms residing in ourselves). A balanced microbiota helps perform our normal body functions, but can induce cancer, if this balance is lost. Microbiota is affected by factors such as pollution and diet, but is also regulated by genetic variants. However, can genetic variants predispose to cancer risk by regulating microbiota? To answer this question, we sequenced the genetic variants of 93 CRC patients and examined the composition of their intestinal microbiota. We identified variants that regulate the presence of benefic or pathogenic bacteria. The same variants also affect the expression of genes that participate in inflammation, immunity and integrity of intestinal tissue. We found that genetic variants regulate gene expression and microbiota at the same time, predisposing to a higher or lower CRC risk. People with variants predisposing to a higher risk may be benefitted by tailored preventive treatments that increase beneficial bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal cytokine and chemokine concentrations during SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent disease severity. We aimed to assess plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations in patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In this study, 260 adults: 126 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 sorted into severity groups: severe (n=68) and mild or moderate (n=58), and 134 healthy controls were enrolled. We quantified 39 plasma cytokines and chemokines using multiplex ELISA. Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Whitney U test were used to identify mechanistically coupled cytokines/chemokines and compare disease severity. Compared to healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of interleukins 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), IFN-{gamma}-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1), eotaxin-3, interferon-gamma (IFN-{Upsilon}), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), and fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1). Patients with severe COVID-19 had higher IL-10 and lower macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) compared to the mild or moderate group (P<0.05). In the receiver operating characteristic curve, SAA, IL-6 and CRP showed strong sensitivity and specificity predicting the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Greater age and higher CRP had a significant association with disease severity (P<0.05). Our findings reveal that CRP, SAA, VCAM-1, IP-10, MDC and IL-10 levels are promising biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity, suggesting that plasma cytokines/chemokines could be used as warning indicators of COVID-19 severity, aid in COVID-19 prognosis and treatment.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammatory reaction resulting in respiratory discomfort and in critical case may result in death. Cytokines and chemokines are inflammatory biomarkers that regulate and determine the nature of immune responses. Measuring cytokine and chemokine levels is useful in stratification, management and treatment of COVID-19 patients as well as guide resource allocations and therapeutic options. Here, we examined ctytokine and chemokine profiles in COVID-19 patients. Understanding how distinct cytokines and chemokines change over time as COVID-19 disease progresses might aid clinicians in detecting severe illness earlier and thereby improve patient prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly becomes dominant globally. Its extensive mutations confer severe efficacy reduction to most of existing antibodies or vaccines. Here, we developed RAMIHM, a highly efficient strategy to generate fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), directly applied it with Omicron-mRNA immunization, and isolated three potent and specific clones against Omicron. Rapid mRNA immunization elicited strong anti-Omicron antibody response in humanized mice, along with broader anti-coronavirus activity. Customized single cell BCR sequencing mapped the clonal repertoires. Top-ranked clones collectively from peripheral blood, plasma B and memory B cell populations showed high rate of Omicron-specificity (93.3%) from RAMIHM-scBCRseq. Clone-screening identified three highly potent neutralizing antibodies that have low nanomolar affinity for Omicron RBD, and low ng/mL level IC50 in neutralization, more potent than majority of currently approved or authorized clinical RBD-targeting mAbs. These lead mAbs are fully human and ready for downstream IND-enabling and/or translational studies.",

We use a combination of a gradient descent, a simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm to find a population of models that fit illustrative data. We analyze this population and present distributions of the model parameters and include a collection of plots of the dilution process for illustrative models.

    "abstract": "Advances in functional brain imaging now allow sustained rapid 3D visualization of large numbers of neurons inside behaving animals. To decode circuit activity, imaged neurons must be individually segmented and tracked. This is particularly challenging when the brain itself moves and deforms inside a flexible body. The field has lacked general methods for solving this problem effectively. To address this need, we developed a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) Awith specific enhancements which we apply to freely moving Caenorhabditis elegans. For a traditional CNN to track neurons across images of a brain with different postures, the CNN must be trained with ground truth (GT) annotations of similar postures. When these postures are diverse, an adequate number of GT annotations can be prohibitively large to generate manually. We introduce  targeted augmentation, a method to automatically synthesize reliable annotations from a few manual annotations. Our method effectively learns the internal deformations of the brain. The learned deformations are used to synthesize annotations for new postures by deforming the manual annotations of similar postures in GT images. The technique is germane to 3D images, which are generally more difficult to analyze than 2D images. The synthetic annotations, which are added to diversify training datasets, drastically reduce manual annotation and proofreading. Our method is effective both when neurons are represented as individual points or as 3D volumes. We provide a GUI that incorporates targeted augmentation in an end-to-end pipeline, from manual GT annotation of a few images to final proofreading of all images. We apply the method to simultaneously measure activity in the second-layer interneurons in C. elegans: RIA, RIB, and RIM, including the RIA neurite. We find that these neurons show rich behaviors, including switching entrainment on and off dynamically when the animal is exposed to periodic odor pulses.",

    "abstract": "Spinally-projecting serotonergic neurons play a key role in controlling pain sensitivity and can either increase or decrease nociception depending on physiological context. It is currently unknown how serotonergic neurons mediate these opposing effects. Utilizing virus-based strategies, we identified two anatomically separated populations of serotonergic hindbrain neurons located in the lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) and the medial hindbrain, which respectively innervate the superficial and deep spinal dorsal horn and have contrasting effects on sensory perception. Our tracing experiments revealed that serotonergic neurons of the LPGi were much more susceptible to transduction with spinally injected AAV2retro vectors than medial hindbrain serotonergic neurons. Taking advantage of this difference, we employed intersectional chemogenetic approaches to demonstrate that activation of the LPGi serotonergic projections decreases thermal sensitivity, whereas activation of medial serotonergic neurons increases sensitivity to mechanical von Frey stimulation. Together these results suggest that there are functionally distinct classes of serotonergic hindbrain neurons that differ in their anatomical location in the hindbrain, their postsynaptic targets in the spinal cord, and their impact on nociceptive sensitivity. The LPGi neurons that give rise to rather global and bilateral projections throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the spinal cord appear to be ideally posed to contribute to widespread systemic pain control.",

The N protein, which was expressed as a fusion protein within herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) stimulated antibodies and CD8+ T cells.

Protection was enhanced if AdC-S vectors were given together with the AdC vaccines that expressed the gDN fusion protein (AdC-gDN). In contrast hamsters that just received the AdC-gDN vaccines showed only marginal lessening of symptoms compared to control animals.

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant exhibits very high levels of transmission, pronounced resistance to authorized therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies and reduced sensitivity to vaccine-induced immunity. Here we describe P2G3, a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) isolated from a previously infected and vaccinated donor, which displays picomolar-range neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and all other current variants, and is thus markedly more potent than all authorized or clinically advanced anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. Structural characterization of P2G3 Fab in complex with the Omicron Spike demonstrates unique binding properties to both down and up spike trimer conformations at an epitope that partially overlaps with the receptor-binding domain (RBD), yet is distinct from those bound by all other characterized mAbs. This distinct epitope and angle of attack allows P2G3 to overcome all the Omicron mutations abolishing or impairing neutralization by other anti-SARS-COV-2 mAbs, and P2G3 accordingly confers complete prophylactic protection in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron monkey challenge model. Finally, although we could isolate in vitro SARS-CoV2 mutants escaping neutralization by P2G3 or by P5C3, a previously described broadly active Class 1 mAb, we found these viruses to be lowly infectious and their key mutations extremely rare in the wild, and we could demonstrate that P2G3/P5C3 efficiently cross-neutralized one anothers escapees. We conclude that this combination of mAbs has great prospects in both the prophylactic and therapeutic settings to protect from Omicron and other VOCs.",

    "abstract": "ContextIntraspecific variability (IV) has been proposed to explain species coexistence in diverse communities. Assuming, sometimes implicitly, that conspecific individuals can perform differently in the same environment and that IV blurs species differences, previous studies have found contrasting results regarding the effect of IV on species coexistence.\n\nObjectiveWe aim at showing that the large IV observed in data does not mean that conspecific individuals are necessarily different in their response to the environment and that the role of high-dimensional environmental variation in determining IV has been largely underestimated in forest plant communities.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe first used a simulation experiment where an individual attribute is derived from a high-dimensional model, representing \"perfect knowledge\" of individual response to the environment, to illustrate how a large observed IV can result from \"imperfect knowledge\" of the environment. Second, using growth data from clonal Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, we estimated a major contribution of the environment in determining individual growth. Third, using tree growth data from long-term tropical forest inventories in French Guiana, Panama and India, we showed that tree growth in tropical forests is structured spatially and that despite a large observed IV at the population level, conspecific individuals perform more similarly locally than compared with heterospecific individuals.\n\nSynthesisAs the number of environmental dimensions that are typically quantified is generally much lower than the actual number of environmental dimensions influencing individual attributes, a great part of observed IV might be misinterpreted as random variation across individuals when in fact it is environmentally-driven. This mis-representation has important consequences for inference about community dynamics. We emphasize that observed IV does not necessarily impact species coexistence per se but can reveal species response to high-dimensional environment, which is consistent with niche theory and the observation of the many differences between species in nature.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance is one of the cornerstones of modern medicine and biomedical research. Over the past several decades, the speed and precision of in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) have increased by leaps and bounds, by utilizing sophisticated excitation and acquisition techniques, from parallel imaging and compressed sensing to magnetic resonance fingerprinting. However, these approaches have all been static in nature, fixing measurement parameters in advance, in anticipation of a wide range of expected tissue parameter values, and are therefore sub-optimal for any given subject. We depart from the conventional framework of magnetic resonance and propose a new approach - termed adaptive magnetic resonance - which binds acquisition and excitation, by using the measured signal to update and fine-tune the measurement parameters in real time. This targets the specific tissue characteristics of the subject while they are being scanned. Adaptive magnetic resonance provides a completely new and previously-untapped avenue for improving the sensitivity and specificity of in-vivo magnetic resonance across all tissue contrast mechanisms. Equivalently, it can accelerate data acquisition compared to non-adaptive schemes, by obtaining the same precision using fewer, optimally tuned excitations. We demonstrate that an adaptive pulse sequence for measuring the transverse relaxation time (T2) of metabolites in-vivo improves upon the precision of static approaches by a factor of {approx} 1.7 - or, alternatively, accelerates acquisition 2.5-fold.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is the only noninvasive method for quantifying microstructure and reconstructing white-matter pathways in the living human brain. Fluctuations from multiple sources create significant additive noise in DWI data which must be suppressed before subsequent microstructure analysis. We introduce a self-supervised learning method for denoising DWI data, Patch2Self (P2S), which uses the entire volume to learn a full-rank locally linear denoiser for that volume. By taking advantage of the oversampled q-space of DWI data, P2S can separate structure from noise without requiring an explicit model for either. The setup of P2S however can be resource intensive, both in terms of running time and memory usage, as it uses all voxels (n) from all-but-one held-in volumes (d - 1) to learn a linear mapping {Phi} : [R]nx(d-1) [&map;] [R]n for denoising the held-out volume. We exploit the redundancy imposed by P2S to alleviate its performance issues and inspect regions that influence the noise disproportionately. Specifically we introduce P2S-sketch, which makes a two-fold contribution: (1) P2S-sketch uses matrix sketching to perform self-supervised denoising. By solving a sub-problem on a smaller sub-space, so called, coreset, we show how P2S can yield a significant speedup in training time while using less memory. (2) We show how the so-called statistical leverage scores can be used to interpret the denoising of dMRI data, a process that was traditionally treated as a black-box. Our experiments conducted on simulated and real data clearly demonstrate that P2S via matrix sketching (P2S-sketch) does not lead to any loss in denoising quality, while yielding significant speedup and improved memory usage by training on a smaller fraction of the data. With thorough comparisons on real and simulated data, we show that Patch2Self outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for DWI denoising both in terms of visual conspicuity and downstream modeling tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via multiple quantitative metrics such as fiber bundle coherence, R2 via cross-validation on model fitting, mean absolute error of DTI residuals across a cohort of sixty subjects.",

    "abstract": "The DNA-sensing cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and mediates type-I interferon inflammatory responses to foreign viral and bacterial DNA as well as self-DNA. Studies of the intervertebral disc in humans and mice demonstrate associations between aging, increased cell senescence, and disc degeneration. Herein we assessed the role of STING in SASP promotion in STING gain- (N153S) and loss-of-function mouse models. N153S mice evidenced elevated circulating levels of proinflammatory markers including IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF- and exhibited a mild trabecular and cortical bone phenotype in caudal vertebrae. Interestingly, despite systemic inflammation, the structural integrity of the disc and knee articular joint remained intact, and cells did not show a loss of their phenotype or elevated SASP. Transcriptomic analysis of N153S tissues demonstrated an upregulated immune response by disc cells, which did not closely resemble inflammatory changes in human tissues. Interestingly, STING-/- mice also showed a mild vertebral bone phenotype, but the absence of STING did not improve the age-associated disc phenotype or reduce the abundance of SASP markers. Overall, the analyses of N153S and STING-/- mice that the cGAS-STING pathway is not a major contributor to SASP induction and consequent disc aging and degeneration but may play a minor role in the maintenance of trabecular bone in the vertebrae. This work contributes to a growing body of work demonstrating that systemic inflammation is not a key driver of disc degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Absence of Isc1, the yeast homologue of mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase type 2, leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction. We show that deletion of another type-C phospholipase, the phosphatidylglycerol (PG)-specific Pgc1, rescues this defect. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) levels and cytochrome c oxidase activity, reduced in isc1{Delta} cells, were restored to wild-type levels in the pgc1{Delta}isc1{Delta} mutant. Pgc1 substrate, PG, inhibited in vitro activity of Isc1 and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase Psd1, an enzyme crucial for PE biosynthesis. We also identify a mechanism by which the balance between the current demand for PG and its consumption is controlled. We document that the product of PG hydrolysis, diacylglycerol, competes with the substrate of PG-phosphate synthase, Pgs1, and thereby inhibits the biosynthesis of excess PG. This feedback loop does not work in the absence of Pgc1, which catalyzes PG degradation. Finally, Pgc1 activity is partially inhibited by products of Isc1-mediated hydrolysis. The described functional interconnection of the two phospholipases contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis throughout the cellular architecture.\n\nSummaryThe coordinated action of two different type-C phospholipases is documented, which provides a balance between mitochondrial phospholipid biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism. The regulatory role of specific lipids, phosphatidylglycerol, diacylglycerol and ceramide in this process is demonstrated.",

While current in vitro approaches subjecting tissues to homogenous stresses, it is currently no possible to recapitulate highly local spatially varying forces. Here we develop a method for local actuation of organoids using embedded magnetic nanoparticles. Sequential aggregation of magnetically labelled human pluripotent stem cells followed by actuation by a magnetic field produces localized magnetic clusters within the organoid. These clusters impose local mechanical forces on the surrounding tissue in response to applied global magnetic fields. We show that precise, spatially defined actuation provides short-term mechanical tissue perturbations as well as long-term cytoskeleton remodeling. We demonstrate that local magnetically-driven actuation guides asymmetric growth and proliferation, leading to enhanced patterning in human neural organoids. We show that this approach is applicable to other model systems by observing polarized patterning in paraxial mesoderm organoids upon local magnetic actuation. This versatile approach allows for local, controllable mechanical actuation in multicellular constructs, and is widely applicable to interrogate the role of local mechanotransduction in developmental and disease model systems.",

Many methods for determining mRNA half-lives rely on transcriptional inhibition or metabolic labelling. Here we use a non-invasive method for estimating half-lives for hundreds of mRNAs in the early Drosophila embryo. This approach uses the intronic and exonic reads from a total RNA-seq time series and Gaussian process regression to model the dynamics of premature and mature mRNAs. We show how regulation of mRNA stability is used to establish a range of mature mRNA dynamics during embryogenesis, despite shared transcription profiles. Using single molecule imaging we provide evidence that, for the mRNAs tested, there is a correlation between short half-life and mRNA association with P-bodies. Moreover, we detect an enrichment of mRNA 3 ends in P-bodies in the early embryo, consistent with 5 to 3 degradation occurring in P-bodies for at least a subset of mRNAs. We discuss our findings in relation to recently published data suggesting that the primary function of P-bodies in other biological contexts is mRNA storage.",

    "abstract": "Animals of different sexes often exhibit unique behaviors that benefit their specific reproductive interests. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, self-fertilizing hermaphrodites can reproduce without a mate and thus prioritize feeding to satisfy the high energetic costs of reproduction. However, males, which rely on finding potential mates for reproduction, sacrifice feeding and instead prioritize exploratory behavior. Here, we demonstrate that these differences in behavior are linked to sexual dimorphism at the cellular level; young males raised on a rich food source show constitutive induction of gut tubular lysosomes, a non-canonical lysosome morphology that typically forms in the gut of young hermaphrodites only when food is limited. We find that male-specific induction of gut tubular lysosomes on abundant food is due to self-imposed dietary restriction through daf-7/TGF{beta} signaling, which promotes mate-searching at the cost of feeding. While gut tubular lysosomes are largely absent from well-fed hermaphrodites at the start of adulthood, their induction accelerates in hermaphrodites in early aging, dependent on the presence of sperm and, partly, on embryo production. These findings identify tubular lysosome induction as a sexually dimorphic cellular event that may integrate animal physiology with sex-specific behavioral differences important for reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne Alphavirus, is the etiological agent of chikungunya fever. To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of CHIKV in China, we performed a molecular epidemiological study during the 2014-2019 period. Phylogenetic analysis of CHIKV in the 2014-2019 shows that it is currently clustered geographically, which means that CHIKVs local adaptability is gradually strengthening. Focusing on CHIKV adaptive mutation E1-A226V is not obvious in our study. The CHIKV E1 amino acid non-synonymous mutation results revealed the common mutation site M343I. Most mutation sites belong to the American epidemic strains, and the mutation rate is 2.8%. In 31 sequences, 19 non-synonymous mutations were found in CHIKV E1 (total mutation rate 20/499 = 4%), and 37 non-synonymous mutations in CHIKV E2 (total mutation rate 30/425 = 7%). It is worth noting that the mutation of CHIKV E2 has changed more than that of CHIKV E1 between 2014 and 2019. CHIKV E2 screened out common mutation sites, and the results showed that there are five common mutation sites, namely S119G, L182M, G206D, S300N, and A345T. Eighty-three percent of the CHIKV E2 receptor binding domain mutations in the American strains, namely T3I and N6H, may cause immune escape.\n\nWe constructed a new luciferase immunosorbent assay using CHIKV E2 antigen and mutant E2 antigen to test the serum of the CHIKV infected patients, and the detected samples and dilution ratios were different. The T3I, N6H, S119G, L182M, G206D, S300N, and A345T mutations in CHIKV E2 could explain these differences between patients.\n\nIMPORTANCECHIKV originated in Africa more than 500 years ago, with a common lineage dividing into two distinct branches called West Africa (West African, WA) and East/Central/South Africa (East/Central/South African, ECSA). Moreover, the E1-A226V mutation enhanced the replication and transmission capacity of CHIKV in Aedes albopictus. However, it should be noted that E1-A226V does not explain the CHIKV epidemic that has occurred in the Americas in recent years. We analyzed CHIKV samples in the 2014-2019, and the results showed that the mutation of CHIKV E1 protein occurred was not mainly concentrated in E1-A226V, but concentrated in M343I. This also means that CHIKV constantly mutates in the natural environment and is formed under natural conditions. Analysis of the common mutation sites of CHIKV E2 showed that there were seven common mutation sites S119G/L182M/ G206D /S300N/A345T, and the new mutation of CHIKV E2 may affect serological antibody detection.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 subtypes differ, among other things, in their clinical manifestations and the speed in which they spread. In particular, the frequency of subtype C is increasing relative to subtype A and D. We aim to investigate whether HIV-1 subtype A, C and D differ in their per-pathogen virulence and to what extend this can explain the difference in spread between these subtypes.\n\nWe use data from the Hormonal Contraception and HIV-1 Genital Shedding and Disease Progression among Women with Primary HIV Infection (GS) Study. For each study participant, we determine the set-point viral load value, CD4+ T cell level after primary infection and CD4+ T cell decline. Based on both the CD4+ T cell count after primary infection and CD4+ T cell decline, we estimate the time until AIDS for each individual. We then obtain our newly introduced measure of virulence as the inverse of the estimated time until AIDS. This new measure of virulence has an improved correlation with the set-point viral load compared to the decline of CD4+ T cells alone. After fitting a model to the measured virulence and set-point viral load values, we tested if this relation varies per subtype. We found that subtype C has a significantly higher per-pathogen virulence than subtype A. Based on an evolutionary model, we then hypothesize that differences in the primary length of infection period cause the observed variation in the speed of spread of the subtypes.\n\nAuthor summaryHIV-1 subtype C is currently spreading relatively fast in various parts of the world. Data from a study that followed many women infected with different HIV-1 subtypes (A, C and D) before they started treatment shows that neither their viral load nor the disease duration are increased for subtype C compared to subtype A and D. Thus, it seems that subtype C does not have a transmission advantage, neither per contact nor due to longer infection, making the observed relative rise in subtype C a puzzle. We used the same data to test if subtype C has optimized its potential to spread by decreasing the disease duration per unit of viral load (per-pathogen virulence) compared to subtype A and D. However, we find that subtype C has a significantly higher per-pathogen virulence than subtype A and D. This result makes the rise of subtype C even more counter-intuitive.\n\nIn a last step, we develop an evolutionary model, in which we synthesize all our empirical results. With this model we can show that the most likely explanation for the global spread of subtype C is a difference in the duration of primary infection between the subtypes.",

Deletion of Lcp1 impeded osteoclast-mediated angiogenesis, which maintained the low levels of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in subchondral bone as well as the whole joint and delayed the OA progression. Stabilization of HIF-1 delayed cartilage degeneration and knockdown of Hif1a abolished the protective effects of Lcp1 knockout. Notably, we identified a novel subgroup of hypertrophic chondrocytes highly associated with OA by single cell sequencing analysis of human articular chondrocytes. Lastly, we showed that Oroxylin A, an Lcp1-encoded protein L-plastin (LPL) inhibitor, could alleviate OA progression. In conclusion, maintaining hypoxic environment in subchondral bone is an attractive strategy for OA treatment.\n\nTeaserInhibiting subchondral osteoclastogenesis alleviates OA progression via maintaining joint hypoxia environment.",

    "abstract": "Modern web techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity for leveraging complex biomedical data generating in clinical, omics, and mechanism experiments. Currently, the functions for carrying out publication-ready biomedical data visualization represent primary technical hurdles in the state-of-art omics-based web services, whereas the demand for visualization-based interactive data mining is ever-growing. Here, we propose an easy-to-use web service, Hiplot (https://hiplot.com.cn), equipping with comprehensive and interactive biomedical data visualization functions (230+) including basic statistics, multi-omics, regression, clustering, dimensional reduction, meta-analysis, survival analysis, risk modeling, etc. We used the demo and real datasets to demonstrate the usage workflow and the core functions of Hiplot. It permits users to conveniently and interactively complete a few specialized visualization tasks that previously could only be done by senior bioinformatics or biostatistics researchers. A modern web client with efficient user interfaces and interaction methods has been implemented based on the custom components library and the extensible plugin system. The versatile output can also be produced in different environments via using the cross-platform portable command-line interface (CLI) program, Hctl. A switchable view between the editable data table and the file uploader/path selection could facilitate data importing, previewing, and exporting, while the plumber-based response strategy significantly reduced the time costs for generating basic scientific graphics. Diversified layouts, themes/styles, and color palettes in this website allow users to create high-quality and publication-ready graphics. Researchers devoted to both life and data science may benefit from the emerging web service.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic chromosomes without nucleosomes have been reconstituted in recent experiments. When topo II is depleted from the reconstituted chromosomes, these chromosomes are entangled and form  sparklers, where DNA is condensed in the core with linker histone H1.8 and condensin is localized at the periphery. To understand the mechanism of the assembly of sparklers, we here take into account the loop extrusion by condensin in an extension of the theory of entangled polymer gels. The loop extrusion stiffens an entangled DNA network because DNA segments in the elastically effective chains are translocated to loops, which are elastically ineffective. Our theory predicts that the loop extrusion by condensin drives the volume phase transition that collapses a swollen entangled DNA gel as the stiffening of the network destabilizes the swollen phase. This is an important element to understand the mechanism of the assembly of the reconstituted chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Tensional homeostasis is a cellular process whereby nonmuscle cells such as fibroblasts keep a constant level of intracellular tension and signaling activities. Cells are allowed thanks to tensional homeostasis to adapt to mechanical stress, but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Here we address from a theoretical point of view what is required for maintaining cellular tensional homeostasis. A constrained optimization problem is formulated to analytically determine the probability function of the length of individual actin filaments (AFs) responsible for sustaining cellular tension. An objective function composed of two entropic quantities measuring the extent of formation and dispersion of AFs within cells is optimized under two constraint functions dictating a constant amount of actin molecules and tension that are arguably the two most salient features of tensional homeostasis. We then derive a specific probability function of AFs that is qualitatively consistent with previous experimental observations, in which short AF populations preferably appear. Regarding the underlying mechanism, our analyses suggest that the constraint for keeping the constant tension level makes long AF populations smaller in number because long AFs have a higher chance to be involved in bearing larger forces. The specific length distribution of AFs is thus required for achieving the constrained objectives, by which individual cells are endowed with the ability to stably maintain a homeostatic tension throughout the cell, thereby potentially allowing cells to locally detect deviation in the tension, keep resulting biological functions, and hence enable subsequent adaptation to mechanical stress. Although minimal essential factors are included given the actual complexity of cells, our approach would provide a theoretical basis for understanding complicated homeostatic and adaptive behavior of the cell.",

    "abstract": "Cell division during early embryogenesis has been linked to key morphogenic events such as embryo symmetry breaking and tissue patterning. It is thought that boundary conditions together with cell intrinsic cues act as a mechanical \"mold\", guiding cell division to ensure these events are more robust. We present a novel computational mechanical model of cytokinesis, the final phase of cell division, to investigate how cell division is affected by mechanical and geometrical boundary conditions. The model reproduces experimentally observed furrow dynamics and predicts the volume ratio of daughter cells in asymmetric cell divisions based on the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle. We show that the orientation of confinement relative to the division axis modulates the volume ratio in asymmetric cell division and quantified the mechanical contribution of cortex mechanics, relative to the mechanical properties of the furrow ring. We apply this model to early C. elegans development, which proceeds within the confines of an eggshell, and simulate the formation of the three body axes via sequential (a)symmetric divisions up until the six cell stage. We demonstrate that spindle position and orientation alone can be used to predict the volume ratio of daughter cells during the cleavage phase of development. However, for compression perturbed egg geometries, the model predicts that the change in confinement alone is insufficient to explain experimentally observed differences in cell volume, inferring an unmodeled underlying spindle positioning mechanism. Finally, the model predicts that confinement stabilizes asymmetric cell divisions against bubble-instabilities, which can arise due to elevated mitotic cortical tension.\n\nAuthor summaryA crucial morphogenic step during early embryonic development is symmetry breaking in the embryo. For C. elegans the formation of the three body axes can be traced back to the six cell stage, where tissue-topology is the result of symmetric and asymmetric divisions. How cell mechanical boundary conditions and cell intrinsic cues influence this process of symmetry breaking is still an open question, as currently, a quantitative mechanical description of cytokinesis in complex architectures is lacking. We developed a simple mechanical model of cell division, incorporated in an existing mechanical cortex model, to simulate cytokinesis in geometrically confined environments. Our approach was able to both capture furrow ring dynamics and predict the volume ratio of daughter cells accurately. By simulating early C. elegans development with different geometrical boundary conditions, we were able to trace back the origin of volume discrepancies between the experimental setups to a quantifiable shift in spindle positioning during cytokinesis. Finally, we showed how embryo confinement partially stabilizes bubble-instabilities that arise during asymmetric cell division during the early cleavage phase.",

In this study, we compare nucleosome binding of two conserved S. cerevisiae basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs, Cbf1 and Pho4. A Cryo-EM structure of Cbf1 in complex with the nucleosome reveals that the Cbf1 HLH region can electrostatically interact with exposed histone residues within a partially unwrapped nucleosome. Single molecule fluorescence studies show that the Cbf1 but not the Pho4 HLH region facilitates efficient nucleosome invasion by slowing its dissociation rate relative to DNA through interactions with histones. In vivo studies show that this enhanced binding provided by the Cbf1 HLH region enables nucleosome invasion and ensuing repositioning. These structural, single molecule, and in vivo studies reveal the mechanistic basis of dissociation rate compensation by pioneer factors and how this translates to facilitating chromatin opening inside cells.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of biomolecular condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation is that they dynamically exchange materials with their surroundings, and this can be crucial to condensate function. How is this rate of exchange controlled? Intuitively, the rate can be limited by the flux from the dilute phase or by the mixing speed in the dense phase. Surprisingly, recent experiments suggest that the exchange rate can instead be limited by the dynamics of molecules at the droplet interface, implying the existence of an \"interface resistance\". We combine theory and simulation to show that interface resistance can arise when incident molecules transiently touch the interface without bonding to the dense phase, i.e., the molecules \"bounce\" from the interface. This occurs when the molecules can adopt conformations that limit the accessibility of their sticky regions. Our work highlights the underappreciated role of interface resistance, with implications for both natural and synthetic condensates.",

    "abstract": "Claudins (Cldns) form a large family of protein homologs that are essential for the assembly of paracellular tight junctions (TJs), where they form channels or barriers with tissue-specific selectivity for permeants. In contrast to several family members whose physiological role has been identified, the function of claudin 4 (Cldn4) remains elusive, despite experimental evidence suggesting that it can form anion-selective TJ channels in the renal epithelium. Computational approaches have recently been employed to elucidate the molecular basis of Cldns function, and hence could help in clarifying Cldn4 role. In this work, we use structural modeling and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to transfer two previously introduced structural models of Cldn-based paracellular complexes to Cldn4, in order to reproduce a paracellular anion channel. Free energy (FE) calculations for ionic transport through the pores allow us to establish the thermodynamic properties driving the ion-selectivity of the structures. While one model shows a cavity permeable to chloride and repulsive to cations, the other forms barrier to the passage of all the major physiological ions. Furthermore, our results confirm the charge selectivity role of the residue Lys65 in the first extracellular loop of the protein, rationalizing Cldn4 control of paracellular permeability.",

    "abstract": "Alternative mRNA splicing is common in cancers. In BRAF V600E mutated malignant melanoma a frequent mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors involves alternative splicing (AS) of BRAF. The resulting shortened BRAF protein constitutively dimerizes and conveys drug resistance. Here, we have analysed AS in SKMEL-239 melanoma cells and a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) resistant derivative that expresses an AS, shortened BRAF V600E transcript. Transcriptome analysis showed differential expression of spliceosome components between the two cell lines. As there is no consensus approach to analysing AS events, we used and compared four common AS softwares based on different principles, DEXSeq, rMATS, ASpli, and LeafCutter. Two of them correctly identified the BRAF V600E AS in the vemurafenib resistant cells. Only 12 AS events were identified by all four softwares. Testing the AS predictions experimentally showed that these overlapping predictions are highly accurate. Interestingly, they identified AS caused alterations in the expression of melanin synthesis and cell migration genes in the vemurafenib resistant cells. This analysis shows that combining different AS analysis approaches produce reliable results and meaningful, biologically testable hypotheses.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484656v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9f4920org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@179e9bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e05632org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3b1c41_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to human health. The high level of antibiotic use in the rearing of livestock is contributing to the origin and persistence of antibiotic resistance amongst humans. Understanding how resistance genes spread from livestock to humans and investigating the impact of managing antibiotic use in livestock will be important for guiding strategies to reduce the risk to humans. We have developed a mathematical model of the transmission of resistance genes from livestock to humans and their spread amongst the human population. Using this framework we demonstrate that although resistant zoonotic foodborne infections do not contribute significantly to the annual burden of death, they could be a source of resistance amongst other pathogens, including those that exclusively spread between humans. Amongst these pathogens, only livestock-derived resistant strains that are associated with a net fitness cost would be expected to decline in prevalence following control strategies aimed at reducing the impact on humans of antibiotic use in livestock.\n\nAuthor SummaryAntibiotics are an essential component of human health care. They are also used in the rearing of livestock for human consumption, which contributes to the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens. Although humans are known to be at risk from antibiotic resistance that evolves amongst livestock, the number of human lives that are at stake remains unclear. Furthermore, the number of lives that could be saved through interventions to reduce antibiotic use in livestock has not been evaluated. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework to explore these questions. Using this framework we explicitly demonstrate that there are too many uncertainties to calculate the number of preventable human deaths. Nevertheless, the importance of reserving new and currently effective antibiotics for human use is clear. Once resistance genes that do not have a fitness disadvantage have spread from livestock to humans, it is too late for interventions targeted at livestock to affect their prevalence in humans in the long term.",

However, the functional significance of these effects, and whether they are moderated by age, remains unclear. In the present study, we used fMRI paired with an associative recognition task to examine retrieval effects in the striatum in a large sample of healthy young, middle aged, and older adults. We identified anatomically segregated patterns of enhanced striatal BOLD activity during recollection- and familiarity-based memory judgments. Successful recollection was associated with enhanced BOLD activity in bilateral putamen and nucleus accumbens. Familiarity effects were evident in the head of the caudate nucleus bilaterally. Crucially, none of these effects were reliably moderated by age. Using psychophysiological interaction analyses, we observed a monitoring-related increase in functional connectivity between the caudate and regions of the frontoparietal control network, and between the putamen and bilateral retrosplenial cortex and intraparietal sulcus. In all instances, monitoring-related increases in cortico-striatal connectivity were unmoderated by age. These results suggest that the striatum, and the caudate in particular, couples with the frontoparietal control network to support top-down retrieval monitoring operations, and that the integrity of these effects are preserved in advanced age.",

Although studies found that early visual experience could influence the endogenous development of visual cortex in animals, little is known about such impact on human infants. Using the multi-modal MRI data from developing human connectome project, we revealed the early structural and functional maps in the ventral visual cortex and their development across the first month of age. Particularly, we found the postnatal experience could modulate both the cortical morphology in ventral visual cortex and the functional circuit between bilateral primary visual cortices. But the cortical myelination and overall functional circuits of ventral cortex, particularly that of the high-order visual cortex, developed without significant influence of postnatal experience in such early period. These experience-dependent cortical properties were further validated in the preterm-born infants who have longer postnatal time but immature cortical development at birth. The results confirmed that the development of cortical thickness was dominated by the postnatal experience but the functional circuit might be determined by the overall maturity of visual cortex. These data suggest in human newborns that early postnatal experience shapes the structural and functional development of the visual cortex in selective and organized pattern.",

In both species correlated dendritic excitatory input led to the initiation of sodium channel-mediated dendritic spikes with conserved biophysical properties. Dendritic sodium spikes in human and rat layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons could be generated across a similar wide input range, exhibited a similar frequency range of activation, and forward propagated with high fidelity to drive neuronal output to implement stereotyped computations.

    "abstract": "Despite extensive studies on the chromatin landscape of exhausted T cells, the transcriptional wiring underlying the heterogeneous functional and dysfunctional states of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is incompletely understood. Here, we identify tissue-specific and general gene-regulatory landscapes in the wide breadth of CD8+ TIL functional states covering four cancer entities using single-cell chromatin profiling. We map enhancer-promoter interactions in human TILs by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility with single-cell RNA-seq data from tumor entity-matching samples, and prioritize key elements by super-enhancer analysis. Our results reveal a human core chromatin trajectory to TIL dysfunction and identify involved key enhancers, transcriptional regulators, and deregulated target genes in this process. Finally, we validate enhancer regulation at immunotherapeutically relevant loci by targeting non-coding regulatory elements with potent CRISPR activators and repressors. In summary, our study provides a framework for understanding and manipulating cell-state-specific gene-regulatory cues from human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) is the causative agent of gastroenteritis. Among the various gut pathogens, STm is still one of the most frequent culprits posing a significant health challenge. STm utilizes its effector proteins to highjack host cell processes. Alteration of SUMOylation, a post-translational modification mechanism, is one such change caused by STm. STm mediated simultaneous downregulation of SUMO-pathway genes, Ubc9 and PIAS1, is required for an efficient infection. In the present study, the regulation of SUMO pathway genes during STm infection was investigated. Promoters of both UBC9 and PIAS1, were seen to harbor binding motifs of AP-1, Activator protein-1 (c-Jun:c-Fos heterodimers or c-Jun:c-Jun homodimers). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, a direct binding of c-Fos to the identified motifs was observed. Perturbation of c-Fos led to changes in expression of Ubc9 and PIAS1, while its SUMO-modifications resulted in differential regulation of its target genes. In line with this, STm infection of fibroblasts with SUMOylation deficient c-Fos (c-FOS-KOSUMO-def-FOS) resulted in uncontrolled activation of target genes, as revealed by 3mRNA-Seq analysis and mathematical modelling, resulting in massive activation of inflammatory pathways. Infection of c-FOS-KOSUMO-def-FOS cells favored STm replication, indicating misdirected immune mechanisms in these cells. Finally, chromatin Immuno-precipitation assays confirmed a context dependent differential binding and release of AP-1 to/from target genes due to its Phosphorylation and SUMOylation respectively. Overall, our data point towards existence of a bidirectional cross-talk between c-Fos and the SUMO pathway and highlighting its importance in AP-1 function relevant to STm infections and beyond.\n\nAuthor summaryFood borne infections caused Salmonella Typhimurium pose a major health challenge in developing and developed world. Unfortunately, many aspects of Salmonella-host crosstalk still remain unknown. In the current work, using sophisticated computational tools along with cell culture experiments and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate how Salmonella controls SUMOylation, a post-translational modification (PTM) pathway of host. SUMOylation governs fundamental processes of the host cell, and its alteration is required for a successful Salmonella infection. We show that SUMO-pathway genes, Ubc9 and Pias1, are direct target genes of AP-1 transcription factor. C-Fos, a component of AP-1 transcriptionally regulates SUMO-genes by binding to their promoters. During Salmonella infection, a selective activation of target genes of c-Fos was observed. The selective regulation of target genes relied on c-fos PTMs. Experimental perturbation of c-Fos PTMs led to global transcriptional dysregulation including immune hyperactivation. Thus, we show existence of a complex interplay between the SUMO-pathway genes and AP-1 transcription factors which mediate selective gene regulation during Salmonella infection.",

    "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG) defines cell shape and protects bacteria against osmotic stress. The growth and integrity of PG require coordinated actions between synthases that insert new PG strands and hydrolases that generate openings to allow the insertion. However, the mechanisms of their coordination remain elusive. Here we show that moenomycin that inhibits a family of PG synthases known as Class-A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs), triggers cell lysis despite aPBPs being non-essential for cell integrity. We demonstrate that inhibited PBP1a2, an aPBP, accelerates the degradation of cell poles by DacB, a hydrolytic PG peptidase, in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. Moenomycin reduces the mobility of DacB molecules through PBP1a2, potentially promoting the binding between DacB and PG. Conversely, DacB also regulates the distribution and dynamics of aPBPs. These findings reveal the lethal action of moenomycin and suggest that disrupting the coordination between PG synthases and hydrolases could be more lethal than eliminating individual enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Copper is essential to most living beings but also toxic. Bacteria have thus developed homeostatic mechanisms to tightly control its intracellular concentration. The 3-gene operon bp2923-bfrG-bp2921 is down-regulated by copper and notably encodes a TonB-dependent transporter in Bordetella pertussis. We show that the protein encoded by bp2923, which is a member of the DUF2946 family, represents a new type of upstream Open Reading Frame (uORF) involved in post-transcriptional regulation of the downstream genes. In the absence of copper, the entire operon is transcribed and translated. Perception of copper by the nascent bp2923-coded protein via its conserved CXXC motif triggers Rho-dependent transcription termination between the first and second genes by relieving translation arrest on a conserved C-terminal RAPP motif. Homologues of bp2923 are widespread in bacterial genomes, where they head operons predicted to participate in copper homeostasis. This work has unveiled an original mode of genetic regulation by a transition metal and identified a regulatory function for a member of an uncharacterized family of bacterial proteins that we have named CruR, for copper-responsive upstream regulator.",

Many substrates are found modified by both SUMO1 and SUMO2/3, while others are modified by one or the other. How isoform specificity is directed is poorly understood. Here we examine modification of the catalytic component of the human SUMO Activation Enzyme, SAE2. We find that an acetylated K164-SAE2 analogue preferentially activates SUMO2 in competition with SUMO1, and that K164-SAE2 discriminates paralogues through their C-terminal regions. We find that K164-SAE2 is deacetylated during mitosis. Mitotic defects in cells expressing an acetylated K164-SAE2 analogue can be corrected by over-expression of SUMO1, suggesting SUMO1 conjugation driven by the deacetylated enzyme supports mitotic fidelity. These surprising data reveal that modification of the SUMO-activating enzyme can bias SUMO paralogue conjugation.",

    "abstract": "The obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis is the causative agent of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide. While the host response to infection by this pathogen has been well characterized, it remains unclear to what extent host gene expression during infection is the product of Chlamydia-directed modulation of host transcription factors. In this report, we show the transcriptome of Chlamydia-infected epithelial cells exhibits gene expression consistent with activity of YAP, a transcriptional coactivator implicated in cell proliferation, organ morphogenesis, wound healing, and fibrosis. After confirming induction of YAP target genes during infection, we observed increased YAP nuclear translocation in Chlamydia-infected epithelial cells. We show that increased YAP activation is a Chlamydia-directed process occurring during midcycle infection; critically, this phenotype is sensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis by the pathogen. Infection-mediated YAP activation bypasses YAP inhibition by the Hippo kinase cascade, instead involving YAP tyrosine phospho-activation and the activity of host Src family kinases. Taken together, our results define a mechanism for Chlamydia-directed modulation of host gene expression independent of the host inflammatory response to infection, as well as introduce novel therapeutic targets for treatment of this pervasive disease.",

    "abstract": "Maternally synthesized products play critical roles in development of offspring. A premier example is the C. elegans H3K36 methyltransferase MES-4, which is essential for germline survival and development in offspring. How maternal MES-4 protects germline immortality is not well understood, but its role in H3K36 methylation hinted that it may regulate gene expression in Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs). We tested this hypothesis by profiling transcripts from single pairs of PGCs dissected from wild-type and mes-4 mutant (lacking maternal and zygotic MES-4) newly hatched larvae. We found that mes-4 PGCs display normal turn-on of most germline genes and normal repression of somatic genes, but dramatically up-regulate hundreds of genes on the X chromosome. We demonstrated that X mis-expression is the cause of germline death by generating and analyzing mes-4 mutants that inherited different endowments of X chromosome(s). Intriguingly, removal of the THAP transcription factor LIN-15B from mes-4 mutants reduced X mis-expression and prevented germline death. lin-15B is X-linked and mis-expressed in mes-4 PGCs, identifying it as a critical target for MES-4 repression. The above findings extend to the H3K27 methyltransferase MES-2/3/6, the C. elegans version of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. We propose that maternal MES-4 and PRC2 cooperate to protect germline survival by preventing synthesis of germline-toxic products encoded by genes on the X chromosome, including the key transcription factor LIN-15B.",

    "abstract": "Photo-identification is a non-invasive method used for recognising wild animals with distinctive and stable patterns over time. This method is now widely used for capture-recapture wildlife monitoring. However, in species exhibiting rapid colouration changes, the evolving body patterns can lead to errors in individual recognition. In this study, we assessed the effect of dorsal physiological colour change of the tiny threatened European leaf-toed gecko (Euleptes europaea) on the performance of Wild-ID and Hotspotter, the two most commonly used individual recognition software for wildlife monitoring. We exposed 30 European leaf-toed geckos to several semi-controlled parameters (substrate type, temperature and light from natural diurnal/nocturnal cycles) in order to characterise the extent of variation in dorsal colouration, by standardised reflectance measurements. The colour of the substrate had a significant effect on individual reflectance changes. Body temperature also seemed to significantly affect the reflectance but the experimental conditions did not allow us to clearly distinguish the effect of temperature and light. For each of the 30 geckos, four photographic databases (n = 4*280) were then analysed by both software packages, under two extreme reflectance conditions. Despite the large changes in individual reflectance, Wild-ID and Hotspotter proved to be extremely reliable with a 100% recognition rate. The analysis of similarity scores suggests that Hotspotter is less sensitive to chromatic variation than Wild-ID. We provide here the first evidence that physiological colour change is not a barrier to computer-assisted individual recognition. This study advocates the use of Hotspotter for monitoring populations of European leaf-toed geckos and other saurians that generate significant colouration change over a short time.",

Recent years have seen drastic increases in both the size and complexity of phylogenetic data as computational resources and genetic/trait databases expand. Graphical representations of these massive phylogenetic datasets push against the limits of legibility, often veering closer to artwork than scientific figures optimized to communicate results. While attractive scientific illustrations are certainly a laudable goal, researchers may want to opt for simpler representations to communicate results more concisely. Here, we introduce a new R package, shiftPlot, which implements methods for simplifying and plotting phylogenetic comparative data on discrete traits. Specifically, shiftPlot automatically finds and collapses clades exhibiting the same character state, effectively creating smaller phylogenies that may be more legibly rendered on standard page sizes. Further, these visualizations more clearly communicate evolutionary dynamics by emphasizing state shifts over tip states. While there are undoubtedly situations where this graphical approach will not be suitable (e.g., continuous traits), we believe shiftPlot will prove useful for modern researchers faced with the task of communicating the results of complex phylogenetic analyses.",

    "abstract": "The optomotor response (OMR) is central to the locomotory behavior in diverse animal species including insects, fish and mammals. Furthermore, the study of the OMR in larval zebrafish has become a key model system for investigating the neural basis of sensorimotor control. However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying control algorithms is still outstanding. In fish it is often assumed that the OMR, by reducing average optic flow across the retina, serves to stabilize position with respect to the ground. Yet the degree to which this assumption is true, and how this could emerge from the intermittent burst dynamics of larval zebrafish swimming is unclear. Here, we combine detailed computational modeling with a new approach to free-swimming experiments, in which feedback gain - i.e., the degree of sensory feedback produced by swimming - is manipulated by varying the height of larval zebrafish above a moving stimulus. We develop an account of underlying feedback control mechanisms that describes not only bout initiation but also the control of swim speed during bouts. We observe that the degree to which fish stabilize their position is only partial and gain-dependent, suggesting that the OMR may not primarily function in fish to prevent drift. We find the speed profile during bouts follows a fixed temporal pattern independent of bout intensity, suggesting that bout termination and bout duration are not explicitly controlled. We also find that the reverse optic flow, experienced when the fish is swimming faster than the stimulus, plays a minimal role in control of the OMR despite carrying most of the sensory information about self-movement. These results shed new light on the underlying dynamics of the OMR in larval zebrafish and will be crucial for future work aimed at identifying the neural basis of this behavior.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn many animals vision is central to the control of locomotory behaviors. In particular, innate motor responses to optic flow allow flying animals to react to gusts of air and fish to changes of current. As fish are washed downstream, for example, movement of the riverbed image across the retina evokes forward movement in bouts (short periods of swimming followed by rest periods). It is typically assumed that this translational optomotor response stabilizes the fishs position to prevent it drifting downstream. In larval zebrafish, this response has become a key model system for investigating the neural basis of sensorimotor behaviors in a vertebrate. Here, we combine behavioral experiments and computational modeling to elucidate the underlying control algorithms. We unpick the detailed relationship between visual stimuli and the initiation, termination and intensity of swim bouts. We find initiation and intensity are controlled separately, and that termination is not explicitly controlled. Surprisingly we also found that the degree of stabilization is only partial and varies systematically with height above ground, raising questions of the function of this response. These findings shed new light on the underlying dynamics which will be crucial for future work to identify the neural basis of this behavior.",

When re-tested, all eight  experienced bats that previously learned the novel prey sounds flew to those sounds within seconds, whereas 17 naive bats tested with the same sounds showed weak responses. Experienced bats also showed behavior indicating generalization of memories between novel sounds and rewards over time.

To simultaneously advance all these aims, we developed prioritized Single Cell ProtEomics (pSCoPE). pSCoPE consistently analyzes thousands of prioritized peptides across all single cells (thus increasing data completeness) while analyzing identifiable peptides at full duty-cycle, thus increasing proteome depth. These strategies increased the sensitivity, data completeness, and proteome coverage over 2-fold. The gains enabled quantifying protein variation in untreated and lipopolysaccharide-treated primary macrophages. Within each condition, proteins covaried within functional sets, including phagosome maturation and proton transport. This protein covariation within a treatment condition was similar across the treatment conditions and coupled to phenotypic variability in endocytic activity. pSCoPE also enabled quantifying proteolytic products, suggesting a gradient of cathepsin activities within a treatment condition. pSCoPE is freely available and widely applicable, especially for analyzing proteins of interest without sacrificing proteome coverage. Support for pSCoPE is available at: scp.slavovlab.net/pSCoPE\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484655v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c44f04org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fb3e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c456eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d271e0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, two-photon stereolithography is adopted to fabricate freestanding perfusable 3D cell scaffolds with micrometer resolution from gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel derived from extracellular matrix protein. As a proof of concept, we introduce an ultracompact bio-hybrid chip layout to demonstrate perfusion and cell seeding of double-digit m proteinaceous channels. This perfusion chip consists of a standardized microfluidic interface fabricated from standard resin and a GM10 bioink channel printed atop of this interface. In addition, we demonstrate that algorithmic design synthesis can recapitulate intact alveoli and capillary networks with tunable design parameters to implement vascularized alveolar tissue models. This approach will allow for a systematic investigation of cell-cell and tissue dynamics in response to defined structural, mechanical and bio-molecular cues and is ultimately scalable to fabricate organ-on-a-chip systems.",

    "abstract": "Viruses remain an area of concern despite constant development of antiviral drugs and therapies. One of the contributors among others is the flaviviridae family of viruses. Like other spaces, antiviral peptides (AVP) are gaining importance for studying flaviviridae family. Along with antiviral properties of peptides, information about bioactivity takes it even closer to accurate predictions of peptide capabilities. Experimental identification of bioactivity of each potential peptide is an expensive and time consuming task. Computational methods like Proteochemometric modelling (PCM) are promising for prediction of bioactivity based on peptide and target sequence. The additional edge PCM methods bring in is the aspect of considering both peptide and target properties instead of only looking at peptide properties. In this study, we propose prediction of pIC50 for AVP against flaviviridae family target proteins. The target proteins were manually curated from literature. Here we utilize the PCM descriptors as peptide descriptors, target descriptors and cross term descriptors. We observe taking peptide and target information improves the results qualitatively and gives better pIC50 predictions. The R2 and MAPE values are 0.85 and 8.44 % respectively",

Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based methods like Hi-C, active or inactive compartments and open or closed topologically associating domain (TAD) structures can be identified on a cell population level. Recently developed high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) molecular imaging techniques such as 3D electron microscopy with in situ hybridization (3D-EMSIH) and 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) enable direct detection of physical representations of chromatin structures in a single cell. However, computational analysis of 3D image data with explainability and interpretability on functional characteristics of chromatin structures is still challenging. We developed Extracting Physical-Characteristics from Images of Chromatin Structures (EPICS), a machine-learning based computational method for processing high-resolution chromatin 3D image data. Using EPICS on images produced by 3D-EMISH or 3D-SIM techniques, we generated more direct 3D representations of higher-order chromatin structures, identified major chromatin domains, and determined the open or closed status of each domain. We identified several high-contributing features from the model as the major physical characteristics that define the open or closed chromatin domains, demonstrating the explainability and interpretability of EPICS. EPICS can be applied to the analysis of other high-resolution 3D molecular imaging data for spatial genomics studies. The R and Python codes of EPICS are available at https://github.com/zang-lab/epics.",

The two central chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 coordinate protein homeostasis, but the nature of the interaction of Tau with the Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery has remained enigmatic. Here we show that Tau is a high-affinity substrate of the human Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery. Complex formation involves extensive intermolecular contacts, blocks Tau aggregation and depends on Taus aggregation-prone repeat region. The Hsp90 co-chaperone p23 directly binds Tau and stabilizes the multichaperone/substrate complex, whereas the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP efficiently disassembles the machinery targeting Tau to proteasomal degradation. Because phosphorylated Tau binds the Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery but is not recognized by Hsp90 alone, the data establish the Hsp70/Hsp90 multichaperone complex as a critical regulator of Tau in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Topological excitations at tissue interfaces can cause local elevations in calcium concentration, possibly providing a bioelectrical mechanism for interface sensing.

    "abstract": "Prostate gland is a highly androgen dependent gland and hence the first line of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer happens to be androgen ablation. This is achieved by multiple non-surgical methods. However, most of these cancers although respond well initially, become resistant to androgen ablation sooner or later. These cancers then become extremely aggressive and difficult to treat, thereby drastically affect the patient prognosis. The purpose of this project was to identify a gene expression signature for castrate resistant prostate cancer which may aid in identification of mechanisms responsible for castrate resistance. For this purpose, we have collected patient samples belonging to a. Control group; b. Castrate Sensitive group and c. Castrate resistant group. Gene expression profiling has been done on these samples using RNA-seq and several differentially expressed genes identified between the castrate sensitive and resistant groups. We have also identified some genes which are expressed in the castrate resistant group alone, which is of interest since these may have an implication in evolution of castrate resistance and also prognosis.\n\nWe have compared this with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using criteria such as overall survival, disease free survival, progression free survival and biochemical recurrence, we have identified genes which may have relevance in progression to castrate resistance and in prognosis. Functional annotation of these genes may give an insight into the mechanism of development of castrate resistance.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic tumor cell invasion into interstitial tissue is a mechanochemical process that responds to tissue cues and further involves proteolytic remodeling of the tumor stroma. How matrix density, tissue guidance and the ability of proteolytic tissue remodeling cooperate and determine decision-making of invading tumor cells in complex-structured three-dimensional (3D) tissue remains unclear. We here developed a collagen-based invasion assay containing a guiding interface of low collagen density adjacent to randomly organized 3D fibrillar lattice and examined the invasion of melanoma cells from multicellular spheroids in response to matrix density, guidance cues and collagenolysis. After 48 hours of culture, two invasion niches developed, (i) sheet-like collective migration along the interface and (ii) single cell- and strand-like invasion into randomly organized 3D matrix. High collagen density impeded migration into the random matrix, whereas migration along a high-density collagen interface was increased compared to the low-density matrix assay. In silico analysis predicted that facilitated interface migration in high-density matrix depended on physical guidance without collagen degradation, whereas migration into randomly organized matrix was strongly dependent on collagenolysis. When tested in 3D culture, inhibition of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-mediated collagen degradation compromised migration into random matrix in dependence of density, whereas interface-guided migration remained effective. In conclusion, with increasing tissue density, matrix cues bordered by dense matrix, but not randomly organized matrix, support effective MMP-independent migration. This identifies the topology of interstitial tissue a primary determinant of switch behaviors between MMP-dependent and MMP-independent cancer cell invasion.",

In addition, biophysical considerations of the interaction of far-UVC with tissue, as well as multiple short-term safety studies in animal models and humans, suggest that far-UVC exposure may be safe for skin and eye tissue. Nevertheless, the potential for skin cancer after chronic long-term exposure to far-UVC has not been studied. Here, we assessed far-UVC induced carcinogenic skin changes and other pathological dermal abnormalities in 96 SKH-1 hairless mice of both sexes that were exposed to average daily dorsal skin doses of 396 mJ/cm2, 126 mJ/cm2 or 56 mJ/cm2 of 222 nm far-UVC radiation for 66 weeks, 5 days per week, 8 hours per day, as well as similarly-treated unexposed controls. No evidence for increased skin cancer, abnormal skin growths, or incidental skin pathology findings was observed in the far-UVC exposed mice.

    "abstract": "Metabolic cost minimization is thought to underscore the neural control of locomotion. Yet, avoiding high muscle activation, a cause of fatigue, often outperforms energy minimization in computational predictions of human gait. Discerning the relative importance of these criteria in human walking has proved elusive, in part, because they have not been empirically decoupled. Here we explicitly decouple whole-body metabolic cost and  fatigue-like muscle activation costs (estimated from electromyography) by pitting them against one another using two distinct gait tasks. When experiencing these competing costs, participants (N=10) chose the task that avoided overburdening muscles (fatigue avoidance) at the expense of higher metabolic power (p<0.05). Muscle volume-normalized activation more closely models energy use and was also minimized by the participants decision (p<0.05), demonstrating that muscle activation was, at best, an inaccurate signal for metabolic energy. Energy minimization was only observed when there was no adverse effect on muscle activation costs. By decoupling whole-body metabolic and muscle activation costs, we provide among the first empirical evidence of humans embracing non-energetic optimality in favor of a clearly defined neuromuscular objective. This finding indicates that local muscle fatigue and effort may well be key factors dictating human walking behavior and its evolution.",

However, the molecular and cellular details underlying this process in halophytes remain unclear. Using free flow electrophoresis and label-free proteomics, we report that the increased abundance of PIPs at the plasma membrane of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum roots under salinity conditions is regulated by clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). To understand this regulation, we analyzed several components of the M. crystallinum CCVs complexes: clathrin light chain (McCLC) and subunits 1 and 2 of the adaptor complex (McAP1 and McAP2). Co-localization analyses revealed the association between McPIP1;4 and McAP2 and between McPIP2;1 and McAP1, observations corroborated by mbSUS assays, suggesting that aquaporin abundance at the PM is under the control of CCVs. The ability of McPIP1;4 and McPIP2;1 to form homo- and hetero-oligomers was tested and confirmed, as well as their activity as water channels. Also, we found increased phosphorylation of McPIP2;1 only at plasma membrane in response to salt stress. Our results prompt how root PIPs from halophytes are regulated through CCVs trafficking and phosphorylation, impacting their localization, transport activity and abundance under salinity conditions.\n\nOne-sentence summaryAbundance of plasma membrane aquaporins in M. crystallinum roots increases in response to salinity via a clathrin-coated vesicle-dependent mechanism.",

    "abstract": "In plants, SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) is a key energy-sensor that orchestrates large-scale transcriptional reprogramming to maintain cellular homeostasis under energy deficit. SnRK1 activity is under tight negative control, although the exact mechanisms leading to its activation are far from being understood. We show that the Arabidopsis DOMAIN OF UNKNOWN FUNCTION (DUF581) protein DUF581-9/FLZ3 binds to the catalytic SnRK1 subunit KIN10 to inhibit its activation by GRIK-dependent T-loop phosphorylation. Overexpression of DUF581-9 in Arabidopsis dampens SnRK1 signalling and interferes with adaptation to dark-induced starvation. The presence of DUF581-9 significantly reduced SnRK1 activity in protoplasts and in vitro. This was accompanied by a reduction in T175 T-loop phosphorylation and also diminished KIN10 auto-phosphorylation. Furthermore, DUF581-9 reduced binding of the up-stream activating kinase GRIK2 to KIN10, explaining the reduced KIN10 T-loop phosphorylation. Ectopically expressed DUF581-9 protein was rapidly turned over by the proteasome when Arabidopsis plants were subjected to starvation treatment, likely releasing its inhibitory activity on the SnRK1 complex. Taken together, our results support a model in which DUF581-9 negatively regulates SnRK1 activity under energy sufficient conditions. Turnover over of the protein provides a rapid way for SnRK1 activation under energy deficit without the need of de-novo protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Low plasma iron (hypoferremia) induced by hepcidin is a conserved inflammatory response that protects against infections but inhibits erythropoiesis. How hypoferremia influences leukocytogenesis is unclear. Using proteomic data, we predicted that neutrophil production would be profoundly more iron-demanding than generation of other white blood cell types. Accordingly in mice, hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia substantially reduced numbers of granulocytes but not monocytes, lymphocytes or dendritic cells. Neutrophil rebound after anti-GR1-induced neutropenia was blunted during hypoferremia, but was rescued by supplemental iron. Similarly, hypoferremia markedly inhibited pharmacologically-stimulated granulopoiesis mediated by GCSF and inflammation-induced accumulation of neutrophils in the spleen and peritoneal cavity. Furthermore, hypoferremia specifically altered neutrophil effector functions, suppressing antibacterial mechanisms but enhancing mitochondrial ROS-dependent NETosis associated with chronic inflammation. Notably, antagonising endogenous hepcidin during acute inflammation enhanced production of neutrophils. We propose plasma iron modulates the profile of innate immunity by controlling monocyte-to-neutrophil ratio and neutrophil activity in a therapeutically targetable system.",

    "abstract": "De novo initiation by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases often requires a polymerase priming residue, located within a priming loop, to stabilize the initiating NTPs. Polymerase structures from three different non-segmented negative strand RNA virus (nsNSV) families revealed putative priming loops in different conformations, and an aromatic priming residue has been identified in the rhabdovirus polymerase. In a previous study of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) polymerase, we found that Tyr1276, the L protein aromatic amino acid residue that most closely aligns with the rhabdovirus priming residue, is not required for RNA synthesis but two nearby residues, Pro1261 and Trp1262, were required. In this study, we examined the roles of Pro1261 and Trp1262 in RNA synthesis initiation. Biochemical studies showed that substitution of Pro1261 inhibited RNA synthesis initiation without inhibiting back-priming, indicating a defect in initiation. Biochemical and minigenome experiments showed that the initiation defect incurred by a P1261A substitution could be rescued by factors that would be expected to increase the stability of the initiation complex, specifically increased NTP concentration, manganese, and a more efficient promoter sequence. These findings indicate that Pro1261 of the RSV L protein plays a role in initiation, most likely in stabilizing the initiation complex. However, we found that substitution of the corresponding proline residue in a filovirus polymerase had no effect on RNA synthesis initiation or elongation. These results indicate that despite similarities between the nsNSV polymerases, there are differences in the features required for RNA synthesis initiation.\n\nAuthor SummaryRSV has a significant impact on human health. It is the major cause of respiratory disease in infants and exerts a significant toll on the elderly and immunocompromised. RSV is a member of the Mononegavirales, the non-segmented, negative strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs). Like other viruses in this order, RSV encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing and replicating the viral genome. Due to its essential role during the viral replication cycle, the polymerase is a promising candidate target for antiviral inhibitors and so a greater understanding of the mechanistic basis of its activities could aid antiviral drug development. In this study, we identified an amino acid residue within the RSV polymerase that appears to stabilize the RNA synthesis initiation complex and showed that it plays a role in both transcription and RNA replication. However, the corresponding residue in a different nsNSV polymerase does not appear to play a similar role. This work reveals a key feature of the RSV polymerase but identifies differences with the polymerases of other related viruses.",

    "abstract": "Natural plant populations often harbour substantial heritable variation in DNA methylation. However, a thorough understanding of the genetic and environmental drivers of this epigenetic variation requires large-scale and high-resolution data, which currently exist only for a few model species. Here, we studied 207 lines of the annual weed Thlaspi arvense (field pennycress), collected across a large latitudinal gradient in Europe and propagated in a common environment. By screening for variation in DNA sequence and DNA methylation using whole-genome (bisulfite) sequencing, we found significant epigenetic population structure across Europe. Average levels of DNA methylation were strongly context-dependent, with highest DNA methylation in CG context, particularly in transposable elements and in intergenic regions. Residual DNA methylation variation within all contexts was associated with genetic variants, which often co-localized with annotated methylation machinery genes but also with new candidates. Variation in DNA methylation was also significantly associated with climate of origin, with methylation levels being higher in warmer regions and lower in more variable climates. Finally, we used variance decomposition to assess genetic versus environmental associations with differentially methylation regions (DMRs). We found that while genetic variation was generally the strongest predictor of DMRs, the strength of environmental associations increased from CG to CHG and CHH, with climate-of-origin as the strongest predictor in about one third of the CHH DMRs. In summary, our data show that natural epigenetic variation in Thlaspi arvense is significantly associated with both DNA sequence and environment of origin, and that the relative importance of the two factors strongly depends on the sequence context of DNA methylation. T. arvense is an emerging biofuel and winter cover crop; our results may hence be relevant for breeding efforts and agricultural practices in the context of rapidly changing environmental conditions.\n\nAuthor SummaryVariation within species is an important level of biodiversity, and it is key for future adaptation. Besides variation in DNA sequence, plants also harbour heritable variation in DNA methylation, and we want to understand the evolutionary significance of this epigenetic variation, in particular how much of it is under genetic control, and how much is associated with the environment. We addressed these questions in a high-resolution molecular analysis of 207 lines of the common plant field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), which we collected across Europe, propagated under standardized conditions, and sequenced for their genetic and epigenetic variation. We found large geographic variation in DNA methylation, associated with both DNA sequence and climate of origin. Genetic variation was generally the stronger predictor of DNA methylation variation, but the strength of environmental association varied between different sequence contexts. Climate-of-origin was the strongest predictor in about one third of the differentially methylated regions in the CHH context, which suggests that epigenetic variation may play a role in the short-term climate adaptation of pennycress. As pennycress is currently being domesticated as a new biofuel and winter cover crop, our results may be relevant also for agriculture, particularly in changing environments.",

Chronic muscle damage eventually leads to histological alterations in skeletal muscles. The identification of genes and cell types driving tissue remodeling is a key step to develop effective therapies. Here we use spatial transcriptomics in two DMD mouse models differing in disease severity to identify gene expression signatures underlying skeletal muscle pathologies and directly link this to the muscle histology. Deconvolution analysis allowed the identification of cell types contributing to histological alterations. We show how the expression of specific genes is enriched in areas of muscle regeneration (Myl4, Sparc, Hspg2), fibrosis (Vim, Fn1, Thbs4) and calcification (Bgn, Ctsk, Spp1). Finally, our analysis of differentiation dynamics in the severely affected D2-mdx muscle shows a subset of the muscle fibers are predicted to become affected in its future state. Genes associated with tissue remodeling could enable to design new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for DMD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic mark that can be used to understand interindividual variability in genomic regulation, and it is influenced by many genetic and environmental factors. Co-methylation between DNAm sites is a known phenomenon but the full architecture of relationships between the approximately 450,000 (450k) sites most commonly measured in epidemiological studies has not been described. We investigate whether the cis and trans interindividual co-methylation structure amongst the 450k sites changes across the lifecourse, whether it differs between UK-born White and Pakistani individuals, and how it may be related to genome regulation.\n\nResultsWe find stability across the life course (birth to adolescence), across cohorts, and between two ethnic groups. Highly correlated DNAm sites in close proximity are highly heritable, influenced by nearby genetic variants (cis mQTLs), and are enriched for transcription factor (TF) binding sites related to regulation of short RNAs essential for cellular function transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Highly correlated sites that are either distant, or on different chromosomes, are driven by both common and unique environmental factors, and methylation at these sites is less likely to be driven by genotype. They are enriched for a multitude of TF binding sites and for inter-chromosomal chromatin contact sites, suggesting that DNA co-methylation of distant sites may be related to long-range cooperative TF interactions.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that DNA co-methylation, especially in cis, has a stable structure from birth to adolescence and between white British and Pakistani individuals. We hypothesise that co-methylation may have roles in genome regulation in humans, including 3D chromatin architecture. The stable structure we have identified might have implications for the future design and interpretation of epigenetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative bovine gait analysis using technology has evolved significantly over the last two decades. However, subjective methods of gait assessment using visual locomotion scoring remain the primary on-farm and experimental approach. The objective of this review is to map research trends in quantitative bovine gait analysis and to explore the technologies that have been utilized to measure biomechanical parameters of gait. A scoping literature review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. A search algorithm based on PICO framework generated three components - bovine, gait, and technology - to address our objectives. Three online databases were searched for original work published from January 2000 to June 2020. A two-step screening process was then conducted, starting with the review of article titles and abstracts based on inclusion criteria. A remaining 125 articles then underwent a full-text assessment, resulting in 82 final articles. Thematic analysis of research aims resulted in four major themes among the studies: gait/claw biomechanics, lameness detection, intervention/comparison, and system development. Lameness detection (55 % of studies) was the most common reason for technology use. Studies in the field of bovine gait analysis used three main technologies: force and pressure platforms (FPP), vision-based systems (VB), and accelerometers. FPP were the first and most popular technologies to evaluate bovine gait and were used in 58.5 % of studies. They include force platforms, pressure mapping systems, and weight distribution platforms. The second most applied technology was VB (34.1 % of studies), which predominately consists of video analysis and image processing systems. Accelerometers, another technological method to measure gait characteristics, were used in 14.6 % of studies. A strong demand for automatic lameness detection influences the path of development for quantitative gait analysis technologies. Although progress has been made, more research is needed to achieve more accurate, practical, and user-friendly technologies.",

    "abstract": "Post-copulatory sexual selection is theorized to favor female traits that allow them to control sperm use and fertilization, leading to the prediction that female reproductive traits that influence sperm migration should differ between polyandrous and monogamous species. Here we exploit natural variation in the female mating strategies of closely related Peromyscus mice to compare female traits that influence sperm motility - the viscosity, pH, and calcium concentration of fluids in the reproductive tract - between polyandrous and monogamous species. We find that the viscosity and pH, but not calcium concentration, of fluids collected from both the uterus and the oviduct significantly differ between species based on mating system. Our results demonstrate the existence of a viscosity gradient within the female reproductive tract that increases in monogamous species but decreases in polyandrous species. Both species have a more alkaline environment in the uterus than oviduct, but only in the polyandrous species did we observe a decrease in calcium in the distal end of the tract. These results suggest that fluid viscosity and pH in the female reproductive tracts of these mice may be influenced by post-copulatory sexual selection and provide a promising potential mechanism for female sperm control given their importance in modulating sperm behavior.",

    "abstract": "Since Braaks initial histological observations, it has been recognized that Alzheimers disease (AD) neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) appear in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of the brain very early in the disease course. MRI-based shape diffeomorphometry markers have demonstrated pre-clinical AD changes in the MTL but it has not been possible to confirm that these MRI changes correspond to the presence of NFTs. Here, we present a method termed Projective LDDMM for aligning sparse measurement profiles of AD pathology (i.e., 2D digital histology images) with 3D MRI. We reconstruct measures of 2D NFT density in the dense metric of 3D MRI, using the Mai Paxinos Atlas coordinates for two cases of advanced AD. Analyses reveal the highest levels of NFT density in the rostral third (10-15 mm) of the hippocampus and the adjoining regions of the entorhinal cortex and amygdala. These findings emphasize the selective vulnerability of MTL subregions in AD, and suggest that high resolution MRI methods might benefit from focusing on the rostral MTL to more closely link these MRI images to AD neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "Absence seizures are characterized by brief periods of unconsciousness accompanied by a lapse in motor function that can occur hundreds of times throughout the day. Outside of these frequent moments of unconsciousness, approximately a third of patients experience treatment-resistant attention impairments. Convergent evidence suggests prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction may underlie attention impairments in affected patients. To test this, we use a combination of slice physiology, fiber photometry, electrocorticography (ECoG), optogenetics, and behavior in the Scn8a+/- mouse model of absence epilepsy. In these mice, we find decreased parvalbumin interneuron (PVIN) recruitment in the medial PFC (mPFC) in vitro and hypoactivity during cue presentation in vivo that is linked to attention dysfunction. Further, we find that low levels of mPFC PVIN activity are predictive of poorer performance in WT littermates. This highlights cue-evoked PVIN activity as an important mechanism for attention and suggests PVINs may represent a therapeutic target for cognitive comorbidities in absence epilepsy.",

Our results suggest that mouse-human homologous genes capture broad patterns of neuroanatomical organization, but that the resolution of cross-species correspondences can be improved using a novel supervised machine learning approach. Using this method, we demonstrate that sensorimotor subdivisions of the neocortex exhibit greater similarity between species, compared with supramodal sub-divisions, and that mouse isocortical regions separate into sensorimotor and supramodal clusters based on their similarity to human cortical regions. We also find that mouse and human striatal regions are strongly conserved, with the mouse caudoputamen exhibiting an equal degree of similarity to both the human caudate and putamen.",
