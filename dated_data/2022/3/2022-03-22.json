    "abstract": "Codon usage and nucleotide composition of coding sequences have profound effects on protein expression. However, while it is recognized that different tissues have distinct tRNA profiles and codon usages in their transcriptomes, the effect of tissue-specific codon optimality on protein synthesis remains elusive. Here, we leverage existing state-of-the-art transcriptomics and proteomics datasets from the GTEx project and the Human Protein Atlas to compute the protein-to-mRNA ratios of 36 human tissues. Using this as a proxy of translational efficiency, we build a machine learning model that identifies codons enriched or depleted in specific tissues. In particular, we detect two clusters of tissues with an opposite pattern of codon preferences. We then use the identified patterns for the development of CUSTOM, a codon optimizer algorithm which suggests a synonymous codon design in order to optimize protein production in a tissue-specific manner. In a human cell model, we provide evidence that codon optimization should indeed take into account particularities of the translational machinery of the tissues in which the target proteins are expressed and that our approach can design genes with tissue-optimized expression profiles. Altogether, CUSTOM could benefit biological and biotechnological research, such as the design of tissue-targeted therapies and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "When challenged with an invading pathogen, the host defense response is engaged to eliminate the pathogen (resistance) and to maintain health in the presence of the pathogen (disease tolerance). However, the identification of distinct molecular programs underpinning disease tolerance and resistance remained obscure. We exploited transcriptional and physiological monitoring across 33 mouse strains, during in vivo influenza virus infection, to identify two host-defense gene programs - one is associated with hallmarks of disease tolerance and the other with hallmarks of resistance. Both programs constitute generic responses in multiple mouse and human cell types. Our study describes the organizational principles of these programs and validates Arhgdia as a regulator of disease-tolerance states in epithelial cells. We further reveal that the baseline disease-tolerance state in macrophages is associated with the pathophysiological response to injury and infection. Our framework provides a paradigm for the understanding of disease tolerance and resistance at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "The danger signals that activate the NLRP1 and CARD8 inflammasomes have not been fully established. We recently discovered that cytosolic peptide accumulation activates these inflammasomes. In addition, we found that the oxidized form of TRX1 binds to and represses NLRP1, suggesting that NLRP1 also detects a lack of reactive oxygen species, or reductive stress. However, no agents that induce reductive stress were known to test this premise. Here, we identify and characterize several radical-trapping antioxidants, including JSH-23, that induce reductive stress. We show that these compounds accelerate the proteasome-mediated degradation of the repressive N-terminal fragments of NLRP1 and CARD8, releasing the inflammasome-forming C-terminal fragments from autoinhibition. Moreover, we found that reductive stress and peptide accumulation together trigger much more intense inflammasome activation than either signal alone. Overall, this work validates chemical probes that induce reductive stress, and establishes reductive stress alongside peptide accumulation as the key inflammasome-activating danger signals.",

    "abstract": "The larvae-to-adult development on the life cycle of zoonotic parasitic tapeworm Taenia solium involves striking -but clinically unappreciated- events with pivotal importance in cestode biology. Unlike the ones related to the intermediate host, the early-adult stages can be addressed in vitro offering a useful model to study evagination, strobilation and worm development. In the absence of a stage-specific transcriptome, postgenomic data exploration followed by single-gene relative expression analysis by RT-qPCR (reverse transcription-quantitative PCR) are useful strategies to gather information on the regulation of genes of interest during parasite development. However, this approach requires the validation of an endogenous reference gene (RG) to achieve accurate comparisons.\n\nTherefore, we analyzed the expression stability of 17 candidate RGs on the context of the early-adult stages of T. solium classified as non-evaginated and evaginated larvae (cysts). The comprehensive tool RefFinder ranked malate dehydrogenase as the most stable gene within these conditions, and its suitability for relative quantification was validated by normalizing the expression of the transporter TGTP1 gene, known for being upregulated upon evagination. This study is the first attempt in finding reliable normalization standards for transcript exploration in genus Taenia.",

    "abstract": "Cell differentiation processes are highly dependent on cell stage-specific gene expression, including timely production of alternatively spliced transcripts. One of the most transcriptionally rich tissues is the testis, where the process of spermatogenesis, or generation of male gametes, takes place. To date, germ cell-specific transcriptome dynamics remain understudied due to limited transcript information emerging from short-read sequencing technologies. To fully characterize the transcriptional profiles of human male germ cells and to understand how the human spermatogenic transcriptome is regulated, we compared whole transcriptomes of men with different types of germ cells missing from their testis. Specifically, we compared the transcriptomes of testis lacking germ cells (Sertoli cell-only phenotype; SCO; n=3), with an arrest at the stage of spermatogonia (SPG; n=4), spermatocytes (SPC; n=3), and round spermatids (SPD; n=3), with the transcriptomes of testis with normal and complete spermatogenesis (Normal; n=3). We found between 839 and 4,138 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, log2 fold change [&ge;] 1) per group comparison, with the most prevalent changes observed between SPG and SPC arrest samples, corresponding to the entry into meiosis. We detected highly germ cell-type specific marker genes among the topmost DEGs of each group comparison. Moreover, applying state-of-the-art bioinformatic analysis we were able to evaluate differential transcript usage (DTU) during human spermatogenesis and observed between 1,062 and 2,153 genes with alternatively spliced transcripts per group comparison. Intriguingly, DEGs and DTU genes showed minimal overlap (< 8%), suggesting that stage-specific splicing is an additional layer of gene regulation in the germline. By generating the most complete human testicular germ cell transcriptome to date, we unravel extensive dynamics in gene expression and alternative splicing during human spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Objective1.Explore the differential metabolites and metabolic pathways between different interstitial lung disease (ILD) and healthy controls, so as to find out new biomarkers and metabolic pathways of ILD and provide new biological targets for IPF diagnosis and treatment.2.Detect the levels of serum related fibrosis and metabolic indexes of ILD, explore the relationship between these indexes and the types and general parameters of ILD diseases, and focus on GDF-15 on the basis of metabonomics, explore new metabolic pathways related to ILD, and further expound the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nMethod1.According to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, the ILD patients admitted to our hospital from January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2022 were signed with informed consent, and all of them had clear multidisciplinary diagnosis. At the same time, the physical examination in the health management center of our hospital was selected as the healthy control group. General clinical data of ILD patients and healthy controls were collected, including gender, age, onset, clinical manifestations, clinical biochemistry, lung function and other related data. Collect patients peripheral venous blood, keep serum samples, and analyze the serum of ILD patients and healthy controls by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to obtain differential metabolites, metabolic maps and related data. According to the diagnosis, the patients were divided into Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD), other interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients and healthy control group. R statistical software was used to observe whether there are differential metabolites in IPF group and healthy control group, CTD-ILD group and healthy control group, other ILD groups and healthy control group, IPF group and CTD-ILD group, IPF group and other ILD groups, CTD-ILD group and other ILD groups by using positive and negative ion flow charts and score charts of orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis. And the potential biomarkers were found through the S-plot diagram of OPLS-DA and the variable weight value VIP>1. ROC curve analysis of differential metabolites was carried out by SPSS21.0 software to analyze the value of differential diagnosis and find out new biomarkers with differential diagnosis significance. Based on KEGG database, the metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites was carried out to find out the main metabolic pathways. 2.Serum levels of type I collagen, KL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNF-, IGF-1 and GDF-15 were detected by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in all patients and healthy controls. Using SPSS21.0 statistical software and R statistical software, using T-test, variance analysis or nonparametric test method, according to different diagnoses (IPF/CTD-ILD/ other ILD/ healthy control group, ILD/ healthy control group, IPF/ other), the data were analyzed and compared in subgroups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between serum biomarkers and other factors such as lung function, metabolomics and so on. ROC curve was used to analyze the diagnostic efficiency of each index, and the best critical value, sensitivity and specificity were found out.\n\nResults1.Analysis of general clinical data and clinical indicators: 26 cases of IPF, 21cases of CTD-ILD, 23 cases of others ILD and 20 cases of healthy control group were included, respectively. There were significant differences in age, sex and smoking history among the four groups (P < 0.05), and the differences were statistically significant. There were statistically significant differences among IPF group, CTD-ILD group and other ILD groups in cough and expectoration symptoms, eosinophil count percentage, creatine kinase, creatine kinase isoenzyme, C-reactive protein and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLco) (P < 0.05). 2. Metabonomics analysis: LC-MC total ion flow chart of serum samples and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of serum samples showed the difference of ion peak intensity, and there were different metabolites among each group. The OPLS-DA model has good quality evaluation and reliable data analysis. There are 193, 115, 101, 188, 148 and 169 differential metabolites in IPF group and healthy control group, IPF group and CTD-ILD group, CTD-ILD group and other ILD groups, others ILD groups and healthy control group respectively. There is a correlation between the differential metabolites of each ILD subgroup and the healthy control group. The most relevant metabolic pathways in IPF mainly include choline metabolic pathway, metabolic pathway and linoleic acid metabolic pathway in cancer. The metabolic pathways most related to CTD-ILD and other ILD include choline metabolic pathway and retrograde neural signal metabolic pathway in cancer. Metabolic pathway and linoleic acid metabolic pathway may distinguish IPF from other ILD. Metabolites involved in metabolic pathway are L-Glutamate, PE(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)/P-18:0) and PC (18: 2 (9z, 12z)/20: 2 (11z, 14z)), respectively. There are three differential metabolites of linoleic acid pathway, namely 12,13-EpOME, 13S-HODE and PC(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:2(11Z,14Z)). There are 35 kinds of differential metabolites in IPF group and healthy control group, and the top three places of AUC are 3- sulfodeoxycholic acid, 20,22-dihydrodigitalis glycoside, ({+/-}14) (15)-EET-SI, with AUC values of 0.985, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92.3%. L- acetylcarnitine, 5-hydroxydodecanoate and L-Glutamate are involved in significant enrichment pathways, among which the ROC curve area of L-Glutamate is the largest, with AUC value of 0.921, cutoff value of 40145.490, sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 96%, and participation in metabolic pathways. 3. Serum metabolism-related detection indexes: The six serum detection indexes of IPF group and CTD-ILD group are higher than those of healthy control group, and the difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05), but the difference between IPF group and CTD-ILD group is not statistically significant (P>0.05). The expression of GDF-15 in IPF group and non-IPF ILD group was higher than that in healthy control group, with significant difference, but there was no significant difference between IPF group and non-IPF ILD group. Type I collagen and IL-1{beta} were negatively correlated with DLco. KL-6 is negatively correlated with the measured values of VC and DLco; IGF-1 was negatively correlated with FVC, VC and DLco (all P<0.05). GDF-15 was positively correlated with type I collagen, KL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNF- and IGF-1, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). ROC curve shows that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of six serum indexes in IPF group is greater than 0.9; In CTD-ILD group, the AUC of IGF-1 was greater than 0.9, the cutoff value was 35.081ng/ml, the sensitivity was 90%, the specificity was 76%, and the area under ROC curve was greater than 0.8, and the difference was statistically significant. In other ILD groups, the ROC curve area of these six indicators ranged from 0.6 to 0.8, among which IGF-1, GDF-15 and TNF- had diagnostic value. In IPF, L-Glutamate was positively correlated with type I collagen, KL-6, IGF-1, IL-1{beta}, TNF- and GDF-15, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05), with the highest correlation with IGF-1.\n\nConclusionIn this study, the serum samples of IPF patients, CTD-ILD patients, other interstitial lung diseases and healthy controls were analyzed by LM-MS and ELISA, and the following conclusions were drawn. 1.There are differences in serum metabolites in different groups. IPF has three main metabolic pathways, namely choline metabolic pathway, metabolic pathway and linoleic acid metabolic pathway in cancer, among which metabolic pathway and linoleic acid metabolic pathway are different from other groups. There are 35 differential metabolites in IPF and healthy control group with the area under ROC curve larger than 0.80, among which the metabolites with the highest diagnostic value are 3- sulfodeoxycholic acid, 20,22-dihydrodigitalis glycoside and ({+/-}) 14 (15)-EET-SI. The AUC value of L- glutamic acid is the highest among the metabolites that participate in the enrichment pathway significantly. 2. The expressions of type I collagen, KL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNF-, IGF-1 and GDF-15 are different in different ILDs, which have potential diagnostic and differential diagnostic value, and are correlated with lung function indexes. In IPF, GDF-15 is positively correlated with L-Glutamate, which may be involved in metabolic pathway to further promote pulmonary fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "How cells monitor the status of translating ribosomes is a major question in gene regulation. Elongating ribosomes frequently stall during mRNA translation, resulting in context- dependent activation of quality control pathways. However, surveillance mechanisms that specifically respond to stalled ribosomes with an elongation factor occupying the GTPase center have not been identified. By employing ternatin-4, an allosteric elongation factor-1 (eEF1A) inhibitor, we unveil an E3 ligase network that triggers ubiquitination and degradation of eEF1A on stalled ribosomes. A CRISPRi screen revealed two E3 ligases of unknown function, RNF14 and RNF25, which are both essential for ternatin-induced eEF1A degradation. Based on quantitative proteomics analysis, we find that RNF14 and RNF25 promote ubiquitination of eEF1A and a discrete set of ribosomal proteins. By forming a complex with RNF14, the ribosome collision sensor GCN1 plays an essential role in eEF1A degradation. Our findings illuminate a translation elongation checkpoint that monitors the ribosomal GTPase center.",

    "abstract": "Migration, a critical evolutionary force, can have contrasting effects on adaptation. It can aid as well as impede adaptation. The effects of migration on microbial adaptation have been studied primarily in simple constant environments. Very little is known about the effects of migration on adaptation to complex, fluctuating environments. In our study, we subjected replicate populations of Escherichia coli, adapting to complex and unpredictably fluctuating environments to different proportions of clonal ancestral immigrants. Contrary to the results from simple/constant environments, the presence of clonal immigrants reduced all measured proxies of fitness. However, migration from a source population with a greater variance in fitness resulted in no change in fitness w.r.t the no-migration control, except at the highest level of migration. Thus, the presence of variation in the immigrants could counter the adverse effects of migration in complex and unpredictably fluctuating environments. Our study demonstrates that the effects of migration are strongly dependent on the nature of the destination environment and the genetic makeup of immigrants. These results enhance our understanding of the influences of migrating populations, which could help better predict the consequences of migration.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHuman-mediated introductions are reshuffling species distribution on a global scale. Consequently, an increasing number of allopatric taxa are now brought into contact, promoting introgressive hybridization between incompletely isolated species and new adaptive gene transfer. The broadcast spawning marine species, Ciona robusta, has been recently introduced in the native range of its sister taxa, Ciona intestinalis, in the English Channel and North-East Atlantic. These sea squirts are highly divergent, yet hybridization has been reported by crossing experiments and genetic studies in the wild. Here, we examined the consequences of secondary contact between C. intestinalis and C. robusta in the English Channel. We produced genomes phased by transmission to infer the history of divergence and gene flow, and analyzed introgressed genomic tracts. Demographic inference revealed a history of secondary contact with a low overall rate of introgression. Introgressed tracts were short, segregating at low frequency, and scattered throughout the genome, suggesting traces of past contacts during the last 30 ky. However, we also uncovered a hotspot of introgression on chromosome 5, characterized by several hundred kb-long C. robusta haplotypes segregating in C. intestinalis, that introgressed during contemporary times the last 75 years. Although locally more frequent than the baseline level of introgression, C. robusta alleles are not fixed, even in the core region of the introgression hotspot. Still, linkage-disequilibrium patterns and haplotype-based tests suggest this genomic region is under recent positive selection. We further detected in the hotspot an over-representation of candidate SNPs lying on a cytochrome P450 gene with a high copy number of tandem repeats in the introgressed alleles. Cytochromes P450 are a superfamily of enzymes involved in detoxifying exogenous compounds, constituting a promising avenue for functional studies. These findings support that introgression of an adaptive allele is possible between very divergent genomes and that anthropogenic hybridization can provide the raw material for adaptation of native lineages in the Anthropocene.",

    "abstract": "The transition from prokaryotic lateral gene transfer to eukaryotic meiotic sex is poorly understood. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that it was tightly linked to eukaryogenesis, which involved an unprecedented rise in both genome size and the density of genetic repeats. Expansion of genome size raised the severity of Mullers ratchet, whilst limiting the effectiveness of lateral gene transfer (LGT) at purging deleterious mutations. In principle, an increase in recombination length combined with higher rates of LGT could solve this problem. Here we show using a computational model that this solution fails in the presence of genetic repeats prevalent in early eukaryotes. The model demonstrates that dispersed repeat sequences allow ectopic recombination, which leads to the loss of genetic information and curtails the capacity of LGT to prevent mutation accumulation. Increasing recombination length in the presence of repeat sequences exacerbates the problem. Mutational decay can only be resisted with homology along extended sequences of DNA. We conclude that the transition to homologous pairing along linear chromosomes was a key innovation in meiotic sex, which was instrumental in the expansion of eukaryotic genomes and morphological complexity.\n\nRelevance StatementThe origin of meiotic sex is a long-standing evolutionary enigma. This novel mechanism of reproduction replaced lateral gene transfer (LGT), the uptake and recombination of pieces of environmental DNA seen in bacteria and archaea. We link its origin to the expanded genome size and proliferation of genetic repeats found in early eukaryotes. Both factors led to high levels of mutation accumulation and gene loss under LGT which could not be retarded through increases in the rate of LGT or the length of DNA recombined. Meiotic sex with homologous pairing of long chromosome sized pieces of DNA promoted purifying selection and supressed ectopic recombination. It permitted the evolution of the expanded genome needed for the evolution of complex eukaryotic life.",

    "abstract": "Acetaldehyde (AA), a by-product of ethanol metabolism, is acutely toxic due to its ability to react with various biological molecules including DNA and proteins, which can greatly impede key processes such as replication and transcription and lead to DNA damage. As such AA is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Previous in vitro studies have shown that AA generates bulky adducts on DNA, with signature guanine-centered (GG[-&gt;]TT) mutations. However, due to its weak mutagenicity, short chemical half-life, and the absence of powerful genetic assays, there is considerable variability in reporting the genotoxic effects of AA in vivo. Here, we used an established yeast genetic reporter system and demonstrate that AA is highly mutagenic and makes strand-biased mutations on guanines (G[-&gt;]T) at a high frequency on single stranded DNA (ssDNA). We further demonstrate that AA-derived mutations occur through lesion bypass on ssDNA by the translesion polymerase Pol{zeta}. Finally, we describe a unique mutation signature for AA, which we then identify in several whole-genome and -exome sequenced cancers, particularly those associated with alcohol consumption.",

    "abstract": "Multicellular development employs periodic spatial patterning to generate repetitive structures such as digits, vertebrae, and teeth. Turing patterning has long provided a key paradigm for understanding such systems. The simplest Turing systems are believed to require at least two signals, or morphogens, that diffuse and react to spontaneously generate periodic patterns. Here, using mathematical modeling, we show that a minimal circuit comprising an intracellular positive feedback loop and a single diffusible morphogen is sufficient to generate stable, long-range spatially periodic cellular patterns. The model considers cells as discrete entities as a key feature, and incorporates transient boundary conditions. Linear stability analysis reveals that this single-morphogen Turing circuit can support a broad range of spatial wavelengths, including fine-grain patterns similar to those generated by classic lateral inhibition systems. Further, signals emanating from a boundary can initiate and stabilize propagating modes with a well-defined spatial wavelength. Once formed, patterns are self-sustaining and robust to noise. Finally, while noise can disrupt patterning in pre-patterned regions, its disruptive effect can be overcome by a bistable intracellular circuit loop, or by considering patterning in the context of growing tissue. Together, these results show that a single morphogen can be sufficient for robust spatial pattern formation, and should provide a foundation for engineering pattern formation in the emerging field of synthetic developmental biology.",

    "abstract": "CARD8 is a pattern-recognition receptor that forms a caspase-1-activating inflammasome. CARD8 undergoes autoproteolysis, generating an N-terminal (NT) fragment with a disordered region and a ZU5 domain and a C-terminal (CT) fragment with UPA and CARD domains. DPP8 and DPP9 (DPP8/9) inhibitors, including Val-boroPro (VbP), accelerate the degradation of the NT fragment via a poorly characterized proteasome-mediated pathway, thereby releasing the inflammatory CT fragment from autoinhibition. Here, we show that the core 20S proteasome, which degrades disordered and misfolded proteins independent of ubiquitin, controls CARD8 activation. In unstressed cells, the 20S proteasome degrades just the NT disordered region, leaving behind the folded ZU5, UPA, and CARD domains to act as an inhibitor of inflammasome assembly. In VbP-stressed cells, the 20S proteasome degrades the entire NT fragment, perhaps due to ZU5 domain unfolding, freeing the CT fragment from autoinhibition. Overall, this work shows that CARD8 NTs susceptibility to 20S proteasome-mediated degradation controls inflammasome activation.",

    "abstract": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a mixture of complex particles mediating reverse cholesterol transport in the human body and several cytoprotective activities. Despite its relevance for human health, many aspects of HDL-mediated lipid trafficking and cellular signaling remain elusive at the molecular level. During HDLs journey throughout the body, its function is mediated through interactions with cell surface receptors on different cell types. Using four different cellular model systems HDL is interacting with, we comparatively analyzed their surfaceomes to define the HDL receptome. Surfaceome analysis of EA.hy926, HEPG2, foam cells, and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) revealed the main currently known HDL-receptor scavenger receptor B1 (SCRB1), as well as 154 shared cell surface receptors representing potential HDL interaction receptor candidates. Since vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) was recently found as a regulatory factor of transendothelial transport of HDL, we next analyzed the VEGF modulated surfaceome of HAEC using auto-CSC technology. VEGF-A treatment led to a remodeling of the surfaceome of HAEC cells including the previously reported higher surfaceome abundance of SCRB1 upon treatment. 165 additional receptors were found on HAEC upon VEGF-A treatment representing SCRB1 co-regulated receptors potentially involved in HDL function. Using HATRIC-based ligand receptor capturing (HATRIC-LRC) technology on human endothelial cells, we specifically aimed for the identification of other bona fide (co-)receptors of HDL beyond SCRB1. HATRIC-LRC enabled, next to SCRB1, the identification of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase Mer (MERTK), which we show is directly contributing to endothelial HDL binding and uptake. Subsequent proximity ligation assays (PLA) demonstrate furthermore the spatial vicinity of MERTK and SCRB1 on the endothelial cell surface. The data shown provide direct evidence for a complex and dynamic HDL receptome and that receptor nanoscale organization may influence functional HDL binding and uptake.\n\nList of human gene and protein names discussed in the paperABCA1: Phospholipid-transporting ATPase ABCA1 (ABCA1)\n\nABCA7: Phospholipid-transporting ATPase ABCA7 (ABCA7)\n\nABCG1: ATB-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1)\n\nACVR2A: Activin receptor type-2A (AVR2A)\n\nAPOA1: Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1)\n\nAPOB: Apolipoprotein B (APOB)\n\nAPOC3: Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3)\n\nAPOH: Beta-2-glycoprotein 1 (APOH)\n\nAPOM: Apolipoprotein M (APOM)\n\nATP5MF: Ecto-F1-ATPase (ATPK)\n\nCD4: T-cell surface glycoprotein CD4 (CD4)\n\nCD14: Monocyte differentiation antigen CD14 (CD14)\n\nCD36: platelet glycoprotein 4 (CD36)\n\nEGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\n\nITGAM: Integrin alpha-M (ITAM)\n\nITGAV: Integrin alpha-V (ITAV)\n\nKDR: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VGFR2)\n\nKIT: Mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (KIT)\n\nMEGF8: Multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains protein 8 (MEGF8)\n\nMEGF10: Multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains protein 10 (MEGF10)\n\nMERTK: tyrosine-protein kinase Mer (MERTK)\n\nMRC2: C-type mannose receptor 2 (MRC2)\n\nMSR1: Macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II (MSRE)\n\nPCDHAC1: Protocadherin alpha-C1 (PCDC1)\n\nPLTP: Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP)\n\nS1PR1: sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1)\n\nS1PR2: sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)\n\nS1PR3: sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3)\n\nSCARA3: Scavenger receptor class A member 3 (SCAR3)\n\nSCARB1: Scavenger receptor B1 (SCRB1)\n\nSLC8A3: Sodium/calcium exchanger 2 (NAC2)\n\nTF: Transferrin (TRFE)\n\nTFRC: Transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFR1)\n\nVEGFA: vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)\n\nSignificance statementA molecular understanding of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptome would provide the rational basis for modulating reverse cholesterol transport. Here we used cellular model systems mimicking tissues involved in HDL-trafficking and reverse cholesterol transport to define the HDL receptome. The receptor tyrosine-protein kinase Mer (MERTK) was identified as a novel mediator of HDL binding and uptake in human aortic endothelial cells. Endothelial MERTK resides within the surfaceome proximal to SCRB1 representing a potential co-receptor. The molecular nanoscale organization of the cell-specific surfaceome may influence cellular HDL interactions and functionality.",

    "abstract": "NLRP1 and CARD8 are related sensors that form inflammasomes, but the danger signals that they detect are not fully established. These proteins undergo autoproteolysis, generating repressive N-terminal (NT) and inflammatory C-terminal (CT) fragments. The proteasome- mediated degradation of the NT releases the CT from autoinhibition, but the CT is then sequestered in a complex with the full-length sensor and DPP9. Here, we show that cytosolic peptide accumulation activates these inflammasomes. We found that a diverse array of peptides accelerates NT degradation, and those with N-terminal XP sequences also destabilize the ternary complexes. Peptides interfere with many biological processes, including protein folding. We show that unrelated agents that disrupt protein folding also induce NT degradation, but do not cause inflammasome activation because DPP9 sequesters the CT fragments in the absence of XP peptides. Overall, these results indicate that NLRP1 and CARD8 detect protein misfolding that is associated with peptide accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of the primary cilium, a microtubule-based signaling organelle, leads to genetic conditions called ciliopathies. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is mediated by the primary cilium in vertebrates and is therefore implicated in ciliopathies; however, it is not clear which immortal cell lines are the most appropriate for modeling pathway response in human disease; therefore we systematically evaluated Hh in five commercially available, immortal mammalian cell lines: ARPE-19, HEK293T, hTERT RPE-1, NIH/3T3, and SH-SY5Y. All of the cell lines ciliated adequately for our subsequent experiments, except for SH-SY5Y which were excluded from further analysis. hTERT RPE-1 and NIH/3T3 cells relocalized Hh pathway components Smoothened (SMO) and GPR161 and upregulated Hh target genes in response to pathway stimulation. In contrast, pathway stimulation did not induce target gene expression in ARPE-19 and HEK293T cells, despite SMO and GPR161 relocalization. These data indicate that human hTERT RPE-1 cells and murine NIH/3T3 cells, but not ARPE-19 and HEK293T cells, are suitable for modeling the role of Hh signaling in ciliopathies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCold exposure may cause health problems and impaired productivity in outdoor or cold-temperature workers. The cold pressor test (CPT) is a laboratory procedure that measures cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses to acute cold exposure such as metabolic activity in brown adipose tissue. How the body responds to acute cold exposure of a hand is not completely understood. We tested the hypothesis that the upper thorax produces heat during a single hand-CPT, which restores warmth to the cold-expose appendage.\n\nObjectivesThe objective was to measure skin temperature changes in the upper thoracic regions and the cold-exposed appendage during a CPT. The secondary objective was to determine if cardiovascular or psychological responses during CPT accounted for skin temperature changes.\n\nMethods50 healthy participants immersed their right hand up to wrist level in 4 {degrees}C water for three minutes. Surface skin temperatures were imaged by infrared thermography at baseline, during CPT, and in the recovery phase. Sublingual oral temperature and water bath temperature were recorded throughout the test. Cardiovascular responses were monitored by continuous finger pulse-wave plethysmography. Peak pain and peak stress were reported by the participants on a Likert scale.\n\nResultsCPT increased the systolic blood pressure (+22 mmHg, p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (+15 mmHg, p < 0.001) and heart rate (+7 beats per minute, p = 0.024). During CPT, skin temperature increased on thoracic regions including mediastinal (+0.5{degrees}C, p < 0.021), sternal (+0.5{degrees}C, p < 0.002), right supraclavicular (+0.3{degrees}C, p < 0.042) and left supraclavicular (+0.3{degrees}C, p < 0.016) regions. During CPT, the hand was cooler on ventral (-14.6{degrees}C p < 0.001) and dorsal (-15.2{degrees}C p < 0.001) sides, and warmed up during recovery. The ventral forearm, dorsal forearm, antecubital fossa, and adjacent medial epicondyle region were significantly cooler throughout the recovery time. The oral temperature did not change during CPT. There were no correlations between the change in mediastinal skin temperature and the sex of the participant, or changes in cardiovascular parameters, peak pain, or peak stress values.\n\nConclusionsLocalized hand cooling caused a rapid warming of the thorax, dissipation of cold in the forearm, and rewarming of the hand during recovery. Thermoregulation was not dependant on pain, stress, sex, or cardiovascular changes between participants. By understanding thermoregulation, better approaches can be developed to mitigate the negative impacts of cold exposure.",
