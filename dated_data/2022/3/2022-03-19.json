    "abstract": "Nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) heterocyclization (Cy) domains generate biologically important ox-/thiazoline modifications in natural products, including in production of compounds targeting disease or siderophores that are important for bacterial pathogenicity. Cy domains share the NRPS condensation domain fold but catalyze consecutive condensation and cyclodehydration reactions via an unknown mechanism. To further understanding of Cy domain catalysis, we report the crystal structure of the second Cy domain (Cy2) of yersiniabactin synthetase from the causative agent of the plague, Yersinia pestis. We find the high-resolution structure of Cy2 adopts a conformation enabling exploration of binding the extended, thiazoline-containing cyclodehydration intermediate for catalysis and the acceptor carrier protein to which it is tethered. We also report complementary electrostatic interfaces between Cy2 and its donor carrier protein that mediate donor binding. Lastly, we explore domain flexibility through the normal mode approximation and identify small-molecule fragment binding sites to inform antibiotic design targeting Cy function. Our results suggest how carrier protein binding may influence global conformation, with consequences for active site catalytic states and inhibitor development.",

    "abstract": "With increases in throughput and reductions in cost, long read sequencing has become the standard for most genome assembly projects and has opened up new avenues for large-scale genomic research. While more amenable to assembly than short-read sequence data, long-read datasets tend to have higher error rates. To address this problem numerous tools have been developed to correct reads before assembly and polish assembled contigs. Although, numerous studies have been conducted to assess or benchmark these tools, few capture the real variance in long read sequence data that might affect tool performance much less full pipeline performance. To address these shortcomings, we compiled a dataset containing long-read sequences of 116 different strains of brewers yeast, S. cerevisiae, gathered largely from public databases and evaluated different assembly-related tools as well as their interactions. We found that pre-assembly short-read error correction of long reads combined with post-assembly short-read polishing provided the best assemblies. We also found that correction/polishing steps with uncorrected long reads often lead to degradation of assembly quality. Finally, we show which tools and pipelines work best with different types of input data.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion of biological nanoparticles in solution impedes our ability to continuously monitor individuals and measure their physical and chemical properties. To overcome this, we previously developed the Interferometric Scattering Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ISABEL) trap, which uses scattering to localize a particle and applies electrokinetic forces which counteract Brownian motion, thus enabling extended observation. Here, we present an improved ISABEL trap that incorporates a near-infrared scatter illumination beam and rapidly interleaves 405 and 488 nm fluorescence excitation reporter beams. With the ISABEL trap, we monitor the internal redox environment of individual carboxysomes labeled with the ratiometric redox reporter roGFP2. Carboxysomes widely vary in scattering contrast (reporting on size) and redox-dependent ratiometric fluorescence. Further, we used redox sensing to explore the chemical kinetics within intact carboxysomes, where bulk measurements may contain unwanted contributions from aggregates or interfering fluorescent proteins. Overall, we demonstrate the ISABEL traps ability to sensitively monitor nanoscale biological objects, enabling new experiments on these systems.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=167 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484789v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fccfacorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a639b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@116fff6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fe95fd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The conclusive identity of Wnt proteins regulating liver zonation (LZ) and regeneration (LR) remains unclear despite an undisputed role of {beta}-catenin. Using single-cell analysis of liver cells from various species, a conserved Wnt2 and Wnt9b expression in endothelial cells (ECs) in zone 3 shown to be the major Wnt cell source, was identified. Conditional EC-elimination of Wnt2 and Wnt9b led to perturbation of LZ with not only loss of {beta}-catenin targets in zone 3, but also re-appearance of zone 1 genes in zone 3, unraveling dynamicity as revealed by single-cell spatial transcriptomics using Molecular Cartography. Defective LR observed in the knockouts phenocopied other models of defective hepatic Wnt signaling. Administration of a tetravalent antibody to activate Wnt signaling rescued LZ and LR in the knockouts. Molecular Cartography on the livers of the agonist-treated animal revealed changes in LZ. Administration of the agonist also promoted LR in acetaminophen overdose acute liver failure (ALF) fulfilling an unmet clinical need. Overall, we report an unequivocal role of EC-Wnt2 and Wnt9b in LZ and LR and show the role of Wnt activators as regenerative therapy for ALF.",

    "abstract": "Titles of scientific papers pay a key role in their discovery, and \"good\" titles engage and recruit readers. A particularly interesting aspect of title construction is the use of humour, but little is known about whether funny titles boost or limit readership and citation of papers. We used a panel of volunteer scorers to assess title humour for 2,439 papers in ecology and evolution, and measured associations between humour scores and subsequent citation (both self-citation and citation by others). Papers with funnier titles were cited less often, but this appears to result from a confound with paper importance. Self-citation data suggest that authors give funnier titles to papers they consider less important. After correction for this confound, papers with funny titles have significantly higher citation rates, suggesting that humour recruits readers. We also examined associations between citation rates and several other features of titles. Inclusion of acronyms and taxonomic names was associated with lower citation rates, while assertive-statement phrasing and presence of colons, question marks, and political regions were associated with somewhat higher citation rates. Title length had no effect on citation. Our results suggest that scientists can use creativity with titles without having their work condemned to obscurity.",

    "abstract": "Genome engineering projects often utilize bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to carry multi-kilobase DNA segments on low copy number vectors. However, DNA synthesis and amplification have the potential to impose mutations on the contained DNA segments that can in turn reduce or prevent viability of the final strain. Here, we describe improvements to a multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) protocol to improve recombineering frequency and multiplexability. This protocol was applied to  recoding an Escherichia coli strain to swap out seven codons to synonymous alternatives genome-wide. Ten 44,402 to 47,179 bp de novo synthesized BAC-contained DNA segments from the recoded strain were unable to complement deletion of the corresponding 33 to 61 wild type genes using a single antibiotic resistance marker. Next-Generation Sequencing was used to identify 1-7 non-recoding mutations in essential genes per segment, and MAGE in turn proved a useful strategy to repair these mutations on the BAC-contained recoded segment when both the recoded and wild type copies of the mutated genes had to exist by necessity during the repair process. This strategy could be adapted to mutation identification and repair for other large-scale genome engineering projects, or for incorporation of small genetic engineering sites for quick protocol adjustments.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to lung injury in cystic fibrosis and asthma, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We sought to understand the impact of human NETs on barrier function in primary human bronchial epithelial and a human airway epithelial cell line. We demonstrate that NETs disrupt airway epithelial barrier function by decreasing transepithelial electrical resistance and increasing paracellular flux, partially by NET-induced airway cell apoptosis. NETs selectively impact the expression of tight junction genes claudins 4, 8 and 11. Bronchial epithelia exposed to NETs demonstrate visible gaps in E-cadherin staining, a decrease in full-length E-cadherin protein and the appearance of cleaved E-cadherin peptides. Pretreatment of NETs with alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) inhibits NET serine protease activity, limits E-cadherin cleavage, decreases bronchial cell apoptosis and preserves epithelial integrity. In conclusion, NETs disrupt human airway epithelial barrier function through bronchial cell death and degradation of E-cadherin, which are limited by exogenous A1AT.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484920v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@841dbforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bd0188org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1afaf97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130fd03_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of HIV gp41 envelope, such as 4E10 and VRC42.01, can neutralize >95% of viruses. These two MPER-directed monoclonal antibodies share germline antibody genes (IGHV1-69 and IGKV3-20) and form a bNAb epitope class. Furthermore, convergent evolution within these two lineages towards a 111.2GW111.3 motif in the CDRH3 is known to enhance neutralization potency. We have previously isolated an MPER neutralizing antibody, CAP206-CH12, that uses these same germline heavy and light chain genes but lacks breadth (neutralizing only 6% of heterologous viruses). Longitudinal sequencing of the CAP206-CH12 lineage over three years revealed similar convergent evolution towards 111.2GW111.3 among some lineage members. Mutagenesis of CAP206-CH12 from 111.2GL111.3 to 111.2GW111.3 modestly improved neutralization breadth (by 9%) and potency (3-fold), but did not reach the levels of breadth and potency of VRC42.01 and 4E10. To explore the lack of potency/breadth, viral mutagenesis was performed to map the CAP206-CH12 epitope. This indicated that CAP206-CH12 is dependent on D674, a highly variable residue at the solvent-exposed elbow of MPER. In contrast, VRC42.01 and 4E10 were dependent on highly conserved residues (W672, F673, T676, and W680) facing the hydrophobic patch of the MPER. Therefore, while CAP206-CH12, VRC42.01, and 4E10 share germline genes and show some evidence of convergent evolution, their dependence on different amino acids, which impacts orientation of binding to the MPER, result in differences in breadth and potency. These data have implications for the design of HIV vaccines directed at the MPER epitope.\n\nAuthor SummaryGermline-targeting immunogens are a promising HIV vaccine design strategy. This approach is reliant on the identification of broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) classes, which use the same germline antibody genes to target the same viral epitopes. Here, we compare three HIV Envelope MPER-directed antibodies (4E10, VRC42.01 and CAP206-CH12) that despite having shared antibody genes, show distinct neutralization profiles. We show that CAP206-CH12 targets a single highly variable residue in the MPER, which results in low neutralization breadth. In contrast, the 4E10 and VRC42.01 mAbs are dependent on highly conserved residues in the MPER, resulting in exceptional neutralization breadth. Our data suggest that while shared germline genes within bNAb epitope classes are required, in some cases these are not sufficient to produce neutralization breadth, and MPER immunogens will need to trigger responses to conserved sites.",

However, a body of research has investigated the ASD gut microbiome without consensus as to whether or how the ASD microbiome differs from neurotypical children. Here, we evaluate the underlying factors leading to study discrepancies by performing a meta-analysis on reprocessed 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon (16S) sequencing data. We compile a total of 1,740 samples across 13 carefully selected published studies together with samples from the American Gut Project, and analyze the data in aggregate and from a per-study perspective. We observed increased Bifidobacterium, Actinobacteria, and Prevotella among ASD individuals across cohorts. We further identified associations to Desulfovibrionales, Deltaproteobacteria and Prevotella that were dependent upon which 16S variable regions were sequenced. Utilizing machine learning (ML), we obtained increased accuracy in ASD classification using data collected from certain territories, on younger subjects, on unrelated age-matched rather than related controls, on samples with increased sequencing depth and when accounting for sex differences. Our work provides compelling evidence that the gut microbiome is altered in ASD patients, and highlights novel factors that are important considerations for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major pathogen that can cause acute respiratory infectious diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract, especially in children, elderly individuals and immunocompromised people. Generally, following viral infection, respiratory epithelial cells secrete cytokines and chemokines to recruit immune cells and initiate innate and/or adaptive immune responses. However, whether chemokines affect viral replication in non-immune cells is rarely clear. In this study, we detect that chemokine CCL5 was highly expressed, while expression of its receptor, CCR1, was downregulated in respiratory epithelial cells after RSV infection. When we overexpressed CCR1 on respiratory epithelial cells in vivo/in vitro, viral load was significantly suppressed, which can be restored by the neutralizing antibody for CCR1. Interestingly, the antiviral effect of CCR1 was not related to type I interferon (IFN-I), apoptosis induction or viral adhesion or entry inhibition; in contrast, it was related to the preferential recruitment and activation of adaptor Gi, which promoted inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3) expression, leading to inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, explicitly, phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 was verified to be among the important factors regulating the activity of HSP90, which has been previously reported to be a chaperone of RSV RNA polymerase. In summary, we are the first to reveal that CCR1 on the surface of non-immune cells regulates RSV replication through a previously unknown mechanism that does not involve IFN-I induction.",

Morbilliviruses infect diverse mammals including humans, dogs, cats, small ruminants, seals, and cetaceans, which serve as natural hosts. Here, I report the identification and characterization of novel viruses associated with South American long-haired and olive field mice. The divergent viruses dubbed Raton olivaceo morbillivirus (RoMV) detected in renal samples from mice collected from Chile and Argentina are characterized by an unusually large genome including long intergenic regions and the presence of an accessory protein between the F and H genes redounding in a genome architecture consisting in 3-N-P/V/C-M-F-hp-H-L-5. Structural and functional annotation, genetic distance and evolutionary insights suggest that RoMV is a member of a novel species within genus Morbillivirus tentatively dubbed South American mouse morbillivirus. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this mouse morbillivirus is closely related to, and clusters into a monophyletic group of novel rodent-borne morbilliviruses. This subclade of divergent viruses expands the host range, redefines the genomic organization and provides insights on the evolutionary history of genus Morbillivirus.",

The present study investigated the biological function of the secreted VIsPLA2 phospholipase in the phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium longisporum with emphasis on its role in host-microbe interactions. The VlsPLA2 was highly induced in V. longisporum during interaction with host plant Brassica napus, encoding an active phospholipase A2. VlsPLA2-overexpression V. longisporum strain showed an increased virulence on Arabidopsis plants, plausibly by inducing virulence factors. Furthermore, VIsPLA2 are transported to the nucleus, by hijacking VAMPA proteins, causing suppression of PTI-induced hypersensitive response, possibly by modulating the expression of genes involved in plant immunity. In summary, VlsPLA2 acts as a virulence factor by hydrolyzing the hosts nuclear envelope phospholipids, an action that induces signaling cascade, suppressing basal plant immunity responses.",

    "abstract": "Genome duplication is essential for cell proliferation and DNA synthesis is generally initiated by dedicated replication proteins at specific loci termed origins. During DNA replication initiation in bacteria, the ubiquitous DnaA protein engages both double-strand DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at the chromosome origin (oriC) to promote DNA duplex unwinding. While the molecular basis for DnaA binding to a specific dsDNA element (\"DnaA-box\") has been established, the mechanism for DnaA binding to a specific ssDNA motif (\"DnaA-trio\") is unclear. Here we define specific steps of DnaA-trio engagement by Bacillus subtilis DnaA. Single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy indicates that DnaA proteins are loaded onto DnaA-trios using DnaA-boxes located on a shared DNA polymer. Chemical modification of either the phosphodiester backbone or the nucleobases revealed that three DnaA-trio repeats proximal to DnaA-boxes are necessary and sufficient to promote DnaA-dependent strand separation, and that the amino group from the central nucleobase of the DnaA-trio is critical for this reaction. Finally, based on electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we propose that during replication initiation DnaA progresses from DnaA-boxes to nucleobase recognition at DnaA-trios before engaging the phosphodiester backbone and destabilizing the DNA duplex. These results provide new molecular insight into DnaA-dependent Bacterial Unwinding System (BUS) activity at a bacterial chromosome origin.",

The genome size is 4.72 Mb, and the G+C content is 36.4%. The in silico DDH homology, ANI, and AAI were below the cutoff value, 70% and 95% to 96%, respectively, as required for novel species delineation. The phylogenomic analysis using core and non-recombinant core genes, the strain PS-8 showed clustering with Chryseobacterium gambrini DSM 18014T. Generally, Chryseobacterium species are considered opportunistic pathogens. Prediction of the virulence genes revealed genes for adherence, biofilm and stability (glf, lpxD, clpE, cps0, clpE, IlpA), proliferation (tufA, cap8E, galE, kfic, bioB, clpP, kdtB, csgD, carB), resistance to immune response (htpB, katA, wbtl, sodB, kpsF), and host-defense evasion system (kpst, clpE, kfic, ybtQ, cap8G, clpP). The cladogram based upon the virulence genes showed a similar phylogeny amongst the Chryseobacterium species. Additionally, secondary metabolites producing gene clusters were identified, including microviridin, resorcinol and polyene, terpene, etc. Our study showed that strain PS-8 constitute a novel species for which Chryseobacterium indicum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PS-8T (= TBRC 15233T = NBRC 115235T).",

CoQ deficiency leads to a wide range of pathological manifestations3 but mechanistic consequences of CoQ deficiency in specific tissues such as BAT remain poorly understood. Here we show that pharmacological or genetic CoQ deficiency (50-75% reduction) in BAT leads to accumulation of cytosolic mitochondrial RNAs (mtRNAs) and activation of the eIF2 kinase PKR resulting in the induction of the integrated stress response (ISR) and suppression of UCP1 expression in an ATF4-dependent fashion. Surprisingly, despite diminished UCP1 levels, BAT CoQ deficiency increases whole-body metabolic rates at room temperature and thermoneutrality resulting in decreased weight gain on high fat diets (HFD). This mitohormesis like effect of BAT CoQ insufficiency is dependent on the ATF4-FGF21 axis in BAT revealing an unexpected role for CoQ in the modulation of whole-body energy expenditure with wide-ranging implications for primary and secondary CoQ deficiencies.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWRates of phenotypic evolution vary markedly across the tree of life, from the accelerated evolution apparent in adaptive radiations to the remarkable evolutionary stasis exhibited by so-called \"living fossils\". Such rate variation has important consequences for large-scale evolutionary dynamics, generating vast disparities in phenotypic diversity across space, time, and taxa. Despite this, most methods for estimating trait evolution rates assume rates vary deterministically with respect to some variable of interest or change infrequently during a clades history. These assumptions may cause underfitting of trait evolution models and mislead hypothesis testing. Here, we develop a new trait evolution model that allows rates to vary gradually and stochastically across a clade. Further, we extend this model to accommodate generally decreasing or increasing rates over time, allowing for flexible modeling of \"early/late bursts\" of trait evolution. We implement a Bayesian method, termed \"evolving rates\" (evorates for short), to efficiently fit this model to comparative data. Through simulation, we demonstrate that evorates can reliably infer both how and in which lineages trait evolution rates varied during a clades history. We apply this method to body size evolution in cetaceans, recovering substantial support for an overall slowdown in body size evolution over time with recent bursts among some oceanic dolphins and relative stasis among beaked whales of the genus Mesoplodon. These results unify and expand on previous research, demonstrating the empirical utility of evorates.",

    "abstract": "Male animals often show higher mutation rates than their female conspecifics. A hypothesis for this male-bias is that competition over fertilization of female gametes leads to increased male investment into reproduction at the expense of maintenance and repair, resulting in a trade-off between male success in sperm competition and offspring quality. Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis by harnessing the power of experimental evolution to study effects of sexual selection on the male germline in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We first show that 50 generations of evolution under strong sexual selection, coupled with experimental removal of natural selection resulted in males that are more successful in sperm competition. We then show that these males produce progeny of lower quality if engaging in socio-sexual interactions prior to being challenged to surveil and repair experimentally induced damage in their germline, and that the presence of male competitors alone can be enough to elicit this response. We identify 18 candidate genes that showed differential expression in response to the induced germline damage, with several of these previously implicated in processes associated with DNA repair and cellular maintenance. These genes also showed significant expression changes across socio-sexual treatments of fathers and predicted the reduction in quality of their offspring, with expression of one gene also being strongly correlated to male sperm competition success. Sex differences in expression of the same 18 genes indicate a substantially higher female investment in germline maintenance. While more work is needed to detail the exact molecular underpinnings of our results, our findings provide rare experimental evidence for a trade-off between male success in sperm competition and germline maintenance. This suggests that sex-differences in the relative strengths of sexual and natural selection are causally linked to male mutation bias. The tenet advocated here, that the choices of an individual can affect plasticity of its germline and the resulting genetic quality of subsequent generations, has several interesting implications for mate choice processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDegradation rate is a fundamental aspect of mRNA metabolism, and the factors governing it remain poorly characterized. Understanding the genetic and biochemical determinants of mRNA half-life would enable a more precise identification of variants that perturb gene expression through post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms.\n\nResultsHere, we establish a compendium of 54 human and 27 mouse transcriptome-wide mRNA decay rate datasets. A meta-analysis of these data identified a prevalence of technical noise and measurement bias, induced partially by the underlying experimental strategy. Correcting for these biases allowed us to derive more precise, consensus measurements of half-life which exhibit enhanced consistency between species. We trained substantially improved statistical models based upon genetic and biochemical features to better predict half-life and characterize the factors molding it. Our state-of-the-art model, Saluki, is a hybrid convolutional and recurrent deep neural network which relies only upon an mRNA sequence annotated with coding frame and splice sites to predict half-life (r=0.77). Saluki predicts the impact of RNA sequences and genetic mutations therein on mRNA stability, in agreement with functional measurements derived from massively parallel reporter assays.\n\nConclusionsOur work produces a more robust \"ground truth\" with regards to transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives in mammalian cells. Using these consolidated measurements, we trained a model that is over 50% more accurate in predicting half-life from sequence than existing models. Our best model, Saluki, succinctly captures many of the known determinants of mRNA half-life and can be rapidly deployed to predict the functional consequences of arbitrary mutations in the transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "In most species, elaborate programs exist to protect chromatin and maintain its integrity over cell cycles and generations. However some species systematically undergo excision and elimination of portions of their genome in somatic cells in a process called programmed-DNA elimination (PDE). PDE involves the elimination of mainly repeated elements but also protein-coding genes. PDE has been described in approximately 100 species from very distinct phyla, and more extensively in the parasitic nematodes Ascaris and in the unicellular Ciliates. In Ciliates, where PDE is pervasive, the underlying mechanisms have been studied and involve small RNA-guided heterochromatinization. In striking contrast, chromatin recognition and excision mechanisms remain mysterious in Metazoans, because the study species are not amenable to functional approaches. Above all, the function of such a mechanism, which has emerged repeatedly throughout evolution, is unknown. Answering these questions will provide significant insights into our understanding of chromatin regulation and genome stability.\n\nWe fortuitously discovered the phenomenon of PDE in all species of the free-living nematode genus Mesorhabditis. Mesorhabditis, which belong to the same family as C. elegans, have a small [~]150 Mb genome and offer many experimental advantages to start elucidating the elimination mechanisms in Metazoans. In this first study, we have used a combination of cytological observation and genomic approaches to describe PDE in Mesorhabditis. We found that the dynamics of chromosome fragmentation and loss are very similar to those described in Ascaris. Elimination occurs once in development, at the third embryonic cell division in all 5 presomatic blastomeres. Similar to other species, Mesorhabditis eliminate repeated elements but also about a hundred unique sequences. Most of the eliminated unique sequences are either pseudogenes or poorly conserved protein-coding genes. Our results raise the possibility that PDE has not been selected for a gene regulatory function in Mesorhabditis but rather mainly is a mechanism to irreversibly silence repeated elements in the soma.",

As observed by Turing in 1952, these patterns are in a state of continual development, and are usually transitioning from one pattern into another. How do cells robustly decode these spatio-temporal patterns into signals in the presence of confounding effects caused by unpredictable or heterogeneous environments? Here, we answer this question by developing a general theory of pattern formation in spatio-temporal variations of  pre-pattern morphogens, which determine gene-regulatory network parameters. Through mathematical analysis, we identify universal dynamical regimes that apply to wide classes of biological systems. We apply our theory to two paradigmatic pattern-forming systems, and predict that they are robust with respect to non-physiological morphogen variations. More broadly, our theoretical framework provides a general approach to classify the emergent dynamics of pattern-forming systems based on how the bifurcations in their governing equations are traversed.",

A key question is the ability of these methods to differentiate binding affinities between several peptides that bind the same receptor. We show a novel application of AlphaFold for competitive binding of different peptides to the same receptor. For systems in which the individual structures of the peptides are well predicted, predictions in which both peptides are introduced capture the stronger binder in the bound state, and the other peptide in the unbound form.

    "abstract": "Networks of intermediate filaments (IFs) need to constantly reorganize to fulfil their functions at different locations within the cell. The mechanism of IF assembly is well described and involves filament end-to-end annealing. By contrast, the mechanisms involved in IF disassembly are far less understood. In vitro, IFs are assumed to be very stable and their disassembly negligible. IF fragmentation has been observed in many cell types, but it has been suggested to be associated with active processes such as IF post-translational modifications. In this article, we uncover the contribution of filament spontaneous fragmentation in the assembly dynamics of type III vimentin IF using a combination of in vitro reconstitution probed by fluorescence imaging and theoretical modeling. We first show that vimentin assembly at low concentrations results in an equilibrium between filament annealing and fragmentation at times [&ge;]24 hours. At higher concentrations, entanglements kinetically trap the system out of equilibrium, and we show that this trapping is reversible upon dilution. Taking into account both fragmentation and entanglement, we estimate that the mean bond breaking time is [~]18 hours. This translates into a mean breaking time of [~] 5 hours for a 1 m long filament, which is a relevant time scale for IF reorganization in live cells. Finally, we provide direct evidence through dual-color imaging that filament fragmentation and annealing coexist during assembly. By showing that IF fragmentation can occur without cofactors or post-translational modifications, our study provides new insights into the physical understanding of the IF length regulation.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of multi-span thylakoid membrane proteins initiates at ribosomes off the membrane. Subsequently, the ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) are transferred to the translocase machinery in the thylakoid membrane for cotranslational protein insertion. These steps require finely tuned mechanisms for protein processing, quality control, and targeting to prevent misfolding or aggregation and to ensure efficient transfer of the nascent chain to the insertion machinery. However, little is known about the regulatory network underlying these processes. To identify factors specifically involved in the cotranslational biogenesis of the reaction center protein D1 of photosystem II we established a chloroplast-derived in vitro translation method that allows the production and affinity purification of stalled RNCs bearing nascent chains of D1 of different defined lengths. Stalled RNCs translating the soluble ribosomal subunit uS2c were affinity-purified for comparison. Quantitative tandem-mass spectrometry revealed a set of about 120 proteins specifically associated with D1 RNCs. The interactome includes proteins with broad functions in protein processing, biogenesis and metabolic pathways, such as chlorophyll biosynthesis. We identified STIC2 as a new factor specifically associated with D1 RNCs. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the interaction of STIC2 with the thylakoid insertase Alb3 and its homologue Alb4 is mediated by the conserved motif III within the C-terminal regions of Alb3 and Alb4. Our data suggest that STIC2 is involved in cotranslational substrate delivery at the thylakoid membrane by coordinating the binding of the D1 RNCs to the insertase machinery.",

Current in vitro compartmentalization systems such as droplet emulsions reproduce the compartmentalization property of cells yet fail to recapture the configurability of cellular communication with the environment. To mimic biological cells a step further and expand the capabilities of in vitro compartmentalization, we present here a general strategy that inherits the passive transport phenomenon of biology. The strategy incorporates layered, micrometer-sized, hydrogel-based compartments featuring configurability in composition, functionality, and selective permeability of biomolecules. We demonstrated the unique advantage of our strategy in two scenarios of synthetic biology. First, a compartmentalized cell-free protein synthesis system was reconstituted that could support multiple rounds of reactions. Second, we constructed living bacteria-based biosensors in the hydrogel compartments, which could achieve long-lasting functioning with markedly enhanced fitness in complex environments. Looking forward, our strategy should be widely applicable for constructing complex, robust, and sustained in vitro synthetic molecular and cellular systems, paving the way for their practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of terminally differentiated plasma cells. MM remains incurable, but overall survival of patients has progressively increased over the past two decades largely due to novel agents such as proteasome inhibitors (PI) and the immunomodulatory agents. While these therapies are highly effective, MM patients can be de novo resistant and acquired resistance with prolonged treatment is inevitable. There is growing interest in early, accurate identification of responsive versus non-responsive patients, however limited sample availability and need for rapid assays are limiting factors. Here, we test dry mass and volume as label-free biomarkers to monitor early response of MM cells to treatment with bortezomib, doxorubicin, and ultraviolet light. For the dry mass measurement, we use two types of phase-sensitive optical microscopy techniques: digital holographic tomography and computationally-enhanced quantitative phase microscopy. We show that human MM cell lines (RPMI8226, MM.1S, KMS20, and AMO1) increase dry mass upon bortezomib treatment. This dry mass increase after bortezomib treatment occurs as early as 1 hour for sensitive cells and 4 hours for all tested cells. We further confirm this observation using primary multiple myeloma cells derived from patients and show that a correlation exists between increase in dry mass and sensitivity to bortezomib, supporting the use of dry mass as a biomarker. The volume measurement using Coulter counter shows a more complex behavior; RPMI8226 cells increase the volume at an early stage of apoptosis, but MM.1S cells show the volume decrease typically observed with apoptotic cells. Altogether, this cell study presents complex kinetics of dry mass and volume at an early stage of apoptosis, which may serve as a basis for the detection and treatment of MM cells.",

    "abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is one of the major contributors to inflammatory pain hyperalgesia, however, the extent to which it modulates the activity of the nociceptive axons is incompletely understood. We used a microfluidic cell culture platform to investigate the changes in responsiveness of sensory axons following treatment with PGE2. We show that the application of PGE2 to fluidically isolated axons leads to sensitization of their responses to depolarising stimuli, and the inclusion of zatebradine, a blocker of HCN channels, blocks this enhancement. However, unexpectedly, we also found that the application of PGE2 to the axons elicited a direct and persistent spiking activity in the sensory neurons. We demonstrate that this persistent activity is due to a direct depolarization of axons by PGE2, which is inhibited by Nav1.8 sodium channel blockers but is mainly refractory to Nav1.7 channel blockade. Both the persistent activity and the membrane depolarization in the axons are abolished by the EP4 receptor inhibitor and a blocker of cAMP synthesis. Our data indicate that PGE2/EP4/cAMP pathway culminates in a sustained depolarization in the sensory axons, leading to the generation of action potentials propagating to the soma. PGE2 therefore, not only mediates nociceptor sensitization but can directly elicit discharges in nociceptive axons, hence redefining its role as a pain mediator in inflammatory conditions.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryProstaglandin E2 can depolarise nociceptive axons in the absence of any noxious stimuli leading to a sustained activation of pain sensing neurons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicroglia are the endogenous immune cells of the brain and act as sensors of pathology to maintain brain homeostasis and eliminate potential threats. In Alzheimers disease (AD), toxic amyloid beta (A{beta}) accumulates in the brain and forms stiff plaques. In late-onset AD accounting for 95% of all cases, this is thought to be due to reduced clearance of A{beta}. Human genome-wide association studies and animal models suggest that reduced clearance results from aberrant function of microglia. While the impact of neurochemical pathways on microglia have been broadly studied, mechanical receptors regulating microglial functions remain largely unexplored.\n\nMethodsHere we showed that a mechanotransduction ion channel, PIEZO1, is expressed and functional in human and mouse microglia. We used a small molecule agonist, Yoda1, to study how activation of PIEZO1 affects AD-related functions in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) -derived microglia-like cells (iMGL) under controlled laboratory experiments. Cell survival, metabolism, phagocytosis and lysosomal activity were assessed using real-time functional assays. To evaluate the effect of activation of PIEZO1 in vivo, 5-month-old 5xFAD male mice were infused daily with Yoda1 for two weeks through intracranial cannulas. Microglial Iba1 expression and A{beta} pathology were quantified with immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Published human and mouse AD datasets were used for in-depth analysis of PIEZO1 gene expression and related pathways in microglial subpopulations.\n\nResultsWe show that PIEZO1 orchestrates A{beta} clearance by enhancing microglial survival, phagocytosis, and lysosomal activity. A{beta} inhibited PIEZO1-mediated calcium transients, whereas activation of PIEZO1 with a selective agonist, Yoda1, improved microglial phagocytosis resulting in A{beta} clearance both in human and mouse models of AD. Moreover, PIEZO1 expression was associated with a unique microglial transcriptional phenotype in AD as indicated by assessment of cellular metabolism, and human and mouse single cell datasets.\n\nConclusionThese results indicate that the compromised function of microglia in AD could be improved by controlled activation of PIEZO1 channels resulting in alleviated A{beta} burden. Pharmacological regulation of these mechanoreceptors in microglia could represent a novel therapeutic paradigm for AD.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=176 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484831v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@832eadorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d8719org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c09740org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9fa85_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections worldwide. Currently, there is lack of consensus on a single optimal diagnostic method for C. difficile infection (CDI). Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) that detect toxin genes are highly sensitive, but their specificity limitations could inflate CDI rates. Alternate multi-step diagnostic algorithms emphasize the detection of C. difficile toxins TcdA/TcdB, and are premised on the rationale that stool toxin-negative (Tox-) CDI patients have less severe disease, shorter diarrhea duration, and fewer disease complications. There have been no systematic assessments, however, of the virulence of C. difficile strains from Tox-/NAAT+ (discrepant) specimens. In our prospective analysis of 1243 C. difficile-positive patient stool specimens from three Southern Arizona hospitals, 31% were discrepant. Ribotype 027 (RT027) strains were recovered from 221 specimens; of these, 23% were discrepant. Post-culture, RT027 strains produced a range of toxin amounts including levels lower than that of the non-epidemic strain CD630. These low-toxin RT027 (LT-027) strains harbored both tcdA and tcdB genes, and their culture supernatants were cytotoxic to cultured fibroblasts. We confirmed robust colonization and virulence of a subset of LT-027 strains using multiple rodent models; lethality in animals infected with LT-027 strains was comparable to that potentiated by a high-toxin RT027 strain. Comparative genomics and proteomics analyses of several LT-027 strains identified unique genes and altered protein abundances relative to closely-related high-toxin strains. Collectively our data highlight the robust virulence and clinical relevance of low-toxin-producing, RT027 C. difficile isolates.",

    "abstract": "The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria is an essential organelle that acts as a formidable barrier to antibiotics. Increasingly prevalent resistance to existing drugs has exacerbated the need for antibiotic discovery efforts targeting the OM. Acylated proteins, known as lipoproteins, are essential in every pathway needed to build the OM. The central role of OM lipoproteins makes their biogenesis a uniquely attractive therapeutic target, but it also complicates in vivo identification of on-pathway inhibitors, as inhibition of OM lipoprotein biogenesis broadly disrupts OM assembly. Here, we use genetics to probe the eight essential proteins involved in OM lipoprotein biogenesis. We define a biological signature consisting of three simple assays that can characteristically identify OM lipoprotein biogenesis defects in vivo. The few known chemical inhibitors of OM lipoprotein biogenesis conform to the biological signature. We also examine MAC13243, a proposed inhibitor of OM lipoprotein biogenesis, and find that it fails to conform to the biological signature. Indeed, we demonstrate that MAC13243 activity relies entirely on a target outside of the OM lipoprotein biogenesis pathway. Hence, our signature offers simple tools to easily assess whether antibiotic lead compounds target an essential pathway that is the hub of OM assembly.\n\nIMPORTANCEGram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane, which acts as a protective barrier and excludes many antibiotics. The limited number of antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacteria, along with rising rates of antibiotic resistance, highlights the need for efficient antibiotic discovery efforts. Unfortunately, finding the target of lead compounds, especially ones targeting outer membrane construction, remains difficult. The hub of outer membrane construction is the lipoprotein biogenesis pathway. We show that defects in this pathway result in a signature cellular response that can be used to quickly and accurately validate pathway inhibitors. Indeed, we found that MAC13243, a compound previously proposed to target outer membrane lipoprotein biogenesis, does not fit the signature, and we show that it instead targets an entirely different cellular pathway. Our findings offer a streamlined approach to discovery and validation of lead antibiotics against a conserved and essential pathway in Gram-negative bacteria.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing has become the method of choice to study the transcriptional landscape of phage-infected bacteria. However, short-read RNA sequencing approaches generally fail to capture the primary 5 and 3 boundaries of transcripts, confounding the discovery of key transcription initiation and termination events as well as operon architectures. Yet, the elucidation of these elements is crucial for the understanding of the strategy of transcription regulation during the infection process, which is currently lacking beyond a handful of model phages. To this end, we developed ONT-cappable-seq, a specialized long-read RNA sequencing technique that allows end-to-end sequencing of primary prokaryotic transcripts using the Nanopore sequencing platform. We applied ONT-cappable-seq to study transcription of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage LUZ7, obtaining a comprehensive genome-wide map of viral transcription start sites, terminators, and complex operon structures that fine-regulate gene expression. Our work provides new insights in the RNA biology of a non-model phage, unveiling distinct promoter architectures, putative small non-coding viral RNAs, and the prominent regulatory role of terminators during infection. The robust workflow presented here offers a framework to obtain a global, yet fine-grained view of phage transcription and paves the way for standardized, in depth transcription studies for microbial viruses or bacteria in general.",

For bilayers made of unsaturated lipids, DOPC and POPC, which adopt the fluid phase at ambient temperature, TEMPO is unequivocally stabilized inside the bilayers.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are multifaceted organelles which are important for bioenergetics, biosynthesis and signaling in metazoans. Mitochondrial functions are frequently altered in cancer to promote both the energy and the necessary metabolic intermediates for biosynthesis required for tumor growth. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that while non-stem, bulk cancer cells utilize glycolysis, breast CSCs are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and therefore targeting mitochondria may inhibit CSC function. We previously reported that small molecule ONC201, which is an agonist for the mitochondrial caseinolytic protease (ClpP), induces mitochondrial dysfunction in breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that ClpP agonists inhibit breast cancer CSC function in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that OxPhos inhibition downregulates multiple pathways required for CSC function, such as the mevalonate pathway, YAP, Myc, and the HIF pathway. ClpP agonists showed significantly greater inhibitory effect on CSC functions compared with other mitochondria-targeting drugs. Further studies showed that ClpP agonists deplete NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H and induce redox imbalance, and dysregulate one-carbon metabolism and proline biosynthesis. Downregulation of these pathways by ClpP agonists further contribute to the inhibition of CSC function. In conclusion, ClpP agonists inhibit breast CSC functions by disrupting mitochondrial homeostasis in breast cancer cells and inhibiting multiple pathways critical to CSC function.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence for the importance of the nuclear envelope in lipid metabolism, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Human mutations in LMNA, encoding A-type nuclear lamins, cause early-onset insulin resistance and NASH, while hepatocyte-specific deletion of Lmna predisposes to NASH with fibrosis in male mice. Given that variants in the gene encoding LAP2, a nuclear protein that regulates lamin A/C, were previously identified in patients with NAFLD, we sought to determine the role of LAP2 in NAFLD using a mouse genetic model. Hepatocyte-specific Lap2a-knockout (Lap2({Delta}Hep)) mice and littermate controls were fed normal chow or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks or 6 months. In contrast to what was observed with hepatocyte-specific Lmna deletion, male Lap2a({Delta}Hep) mice showed no increase in hepatic steatosis or NASH compared to controls. Rather, Lap2a({Delta}Hep) mice demonstrated reduced hepatic steatosis, particularly after long-term HFD, with decreased susceptibility to diet-induced NASH. Accordingly, whereas pro-steatotic genes Cidea, Mogat1, and Cd36 were upregulated in Lmn-KO mice, they were downregulated in Lap2({Delta}Hep) mice, and there was a trend toward decreases in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes. These data indicate that hepatocyte-specific Lap2a deletion protects against hepatic steatosis and NASH in mice; therefore, LAP2 might represent a potential therapeutic target in human NASH.\n\nBrief SummaryLoss of LAP2 in mouse hepatocytes protected against diet-induced hepatic steatosis and NASH.",

    "abstract": "Triphosphate tunnel metalloenzymes (TTMs) are found in all biological kingdoms and have been characterized in microorganisms and animals. Members of the TTM family already characterized have divergent biological functions and act on a range of triphosphorylated substrates (RNA, thiamine triphosphate, inorganic polyphosphate). TTM proteins in plants have received considerably less attention and are unique in that some homologs harbor additional domains including a P-loop kinase and transmembrane domain. Here we report on structural and functional aspects of the multimodular TTM1 and TTM2 of Arabidopsis thaliana. Tissue and cellular microscopy studies show that both AtTTM1 and AtTTM2 are expressed in actively dividing (meristem) tissue and are tail-anchored proteins at the outer mitochondrial membrane - mediated by the single transmembrane domain at the C-terminus, supporting earlier studies. Crystal structures of AtTTM1 in the presence and absence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog reveal a catalytically incompetent TTM tunnel domain tightly interacting with the P-loop kinase domain that is locked in an inactive conformation. Structural comparison reveals that a helical hairpin may facilitate movement of the TTM domain thereby activating the kinase. Genetic studies show that AtTTM2 is important for the developmental transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in Arabidopsis, whereas its closest paralog AtTTM1 is not. Rational design of mutations based on the 3D structure demonstrates that both the P-loop kinase and TTM tunnel modules of AtTTM2 are required for the developmental switch.",
