    "abstract": "Deep-sea microbial communities are exposed to high hydrostatic pressure. While some of these deep-sea prokaryotes are adapted to high-pressure conditions, the contribution of piezophilic (i.e., pressure-loving) and piezotolerant prokaryotes to the total deep-sea prokaryotic community remains unknown. Here we show that the metabolic activity of prokaryotic communities is increasingly inhibited with increasing hydrostatic pressure. At 4,000 m depth, the bulk heterotrophic prokaryotic activity under in situ hydrostatic pressure was only about one-third of that measured on the same community at atmospheric pressure conditions. Only [~]5% of the bathypelagic prokaryotic community are piezophilic while [~]85% of the deep-sea prokaryotes are piezotolerant. A small fraction ([~]10%) of the deep-sea prokaryotes is piezosensitive (mainly members of Bacteroidetes, Alteromonas) exhibiting specific survival strategies at meso- and bathypelagic depths. These piezosensitive bacteria elevated their activity by more than 100-fold upon depressurization. Hence, the consistently higher bulk metabolic activity of the deep-sea prokaryotic community measured upon depressurization is due to a rather small fraction of the prokaryotic community. Overall, the heterotrophic prokaryotic activity in the deep-sea is substantially lower than hitherto assumed with major impacts on the oceanic carbon cycling.",

    "abstract": "Centromeric histones (CenH3s) are essential for chromosome inheritance during cell division in most eukaryotes. CenH3 genes have rapidly evolved and undergone repeated gene duplications and diversification in many plant and animal species. In Caenorhabditis, two independent duplications of CenH3 (named hcp-3 for HoloCentric chromosome-binding Protein 3) have been previously identified: in C. elegans and C. remanei. Here, using phylogenomic analyses in Caenorhabditis, we find strict retention of the ancestral hcp-3 gene and eight additional independent hcp-3 duplications, most of which are only found in one or two species. hcp-3L (hcp-3-like) paralogs are expressed in both sexes (males and females/ hermaphrodites) and have a conserved histone fold domain. We identified novel N-terminal protein motifs, including putative kinetochore protein-interacting motifs and a potential separase cleavage site, which are well-conserved across Caenorhabditis HCP-3 proteins. Other N-terminal motifs vary in their retention across paralogs or species, revealing potential sub-functionalization or functional loss following duplication. C. afra encodes an unprecedented protein fusion, where the hcp-3 paralog fused to duplicated segments from hcp-4 (nematode CENP-C). Extending our analyses beyond CenH3, we found gene duplications of six inner and outer kinetochore genes in Caenorhabditis, including co-retention of different kinetochore protein paralogs in a few species. Our findings suggest that centromeric protein duplications occur frequently in Caenorhabditis nematodes, are selectively retained under purifying selection but only for short evolutionary periods, then degenerate or are lost entirely. We hypothesize that unique challenges associated with holocentricity in Caenorhabditis may lead to this rapid  revolving door of kinetochore protein paralogs.",

    "abstract": "Activation of endogenous retroviruses leads to widespread transcriptional reprograming, affecting innate immune activation, metabolic control, and development. We find that the histone variant H2A.Z plays a central role in orchestrating these responses. Stimulating retroviral expression in zebrafish embryos causes H2A.Z to exit developmental gene promoters, which become silent, and to accumulate specifically at  primed repetitive elements, which are pre-marked by H3K27ac and H3K9me3. Remarkably, this rewiring is greatly influenced by total H2A.Z abundance, and developmental consequences of retrovirus activation are mitigated by H2A.Z over-expression. Our results uncover mechanisms whereby H2A.Z levels determine sensitivity to retroviral activation, and repetitive elements function as a nuclear sink to dramatically influence total transcriptional output.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=162 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/486614v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (61K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@275f37org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc2d9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135f599org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18f290c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Hawaiian monk seal (HMS) is the single extant species of tropical earless seals of the genus Neomonachus. The species survived a severe bottleneck in the late 19th century and experienced subsequent population declines until becoming the subject of a NOAA-led species recovery effort beginning in 1976 when the population was fewer than 1000 animals. Like other recovering species, the Hawaiian monk seal has been reported to have reduced genetic heterogeneity due to the bottleneck and subsequent inbreeding. Here we report a chromosomal reference assembly for a male animal produced using a variety of methods including linked-read sequencing, Hi-C contiguity mapping, optical genome mapping, and nanopore long read sequencing. The final assembly consisted of 16 autosomes, an X and portions of the Y chromosomes. We compared variants in the reference animals to nine other HMS and to the human reference NA12878 confirming a low level of variation within the species and one-eighth that of the human reference. A lack of variation in several MHC genes was documented suggesting that this species may be at risk for infectious disease. Lastly, the HMS chromosomal assembly confirmed significant synteny with other pinnipeds. This reference should be a useful tool for long-term management of HMS and evolutionary studies of other carnivorans.",

    "abstract": "Hsp40s play a central role in cellular protein homeostasis by promiscuously surveying the proteome for misfolded proteins. These misfolded client proteins are then delivered to Hsp70. Mutation of the Hsp40 J-domain blocks Hsp70 binding, inhibiting client protein release from Hsp40. We previously integrated misfolded protein recognition by Hsp40 into a platform to identify proteins that are destabilized by cellular stress. However, the dependences of Hsp40 interactions and client recovery on J-domain activity, Hsp40 identity, and crosslinking have not been addressed. Herein, we apply quantitative proteomics to systematically characterize the interactions networks of human Hsp40s DNAJB8 and DNAJB1 with intact or inactivated J-domains. We find that DNAJB8 irreversibly binds over a thousand protein interactors even in the absence of stress. Inactivation of the J-domain decreases interaction with Hsp70 family and associated proteins, but does not generally affect client binding. By contrast, J-domain inactivation and cellular crosslinking substantially increase the relative recovery of proteins from DNAJB1 co-immunoprecipitation. This advantage is completely offset by loss of DNAJB1 recovery under these conditions, making DNAJB1 a poor bait for client protein recovery as compared to DNAJB8. The J-domain inactivated DNAJB8H31Q has increased affinity to its client proteins under heat stress, while no such change in affinity is observed for the wild-type protein, despite their similar client binding profiles under basal conditions. Hence, we find that DNAJB8H31Q is an effective recognition element for the recovery of destabilized client proteins following cellular stress.

Our understanding of the cellular functions of choline and its metabolites, independent of their roles as choline lipid metabolism intermediates, remains limited. In addition to fundamental cellular physiology, this knowledge has implications for cancer biology because elevated choline metabolite levels are a hallmark of cancer. Here, we establish the mammalian choline metabolite-interacting proteome by utilizing a photocrosslinkable choline probe. To design this probe, we performed metabolic labeling experiments with structurally diverse choline analogs that resulted in the serendipitous discovery of a choline lipid headgroup remodeling mechanism involving sequential dealkylation and methylation steps. We demonstrate that phosphocholine inhibits the binding of one of the proteins identified, the attractive anticancer target, p32, to its endogenous ligands and to the promising p32-targeting anticancer agent, Lyp-1.

    "abstract": "The integration host factor (IHF) is a prominent example of indirect readout as it imposes one of the strongest bends on relaxed linear DNA. However, the relation between IHF and torsionally constrained DNA, as occurs physiologically, remains unclear. By using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on DNA minicircles, we reveal, for the first time, the reciprocal influence between a DNA-bending protein and supercoiling. While the increased curvature of supercoiled DNA enhances wrapping around IHF, the protein pins the position of plectonemes, organizing the topology of the loop in a unique and specific manner. In addition, IHF restrains underor overtwisted DNA depending on whether the complex is formed in negatively or positively supercoiled DNA. This effectively enables IHF to become a  supercoiling buffer that dampens changes in the surrounding superhelical stress through DNA breathing around the protein or complex dissociation. We finally provide evidence of DNA bridging by IHF and reveal that these bridges divide DNA into independent topological domains. We anticipate that the crosstalk detected here between the  active DNA and the multifaceted IHF could be common to other DNA-protein complexes relying on the deformation of DNA.",

    "abstract": "CD8+ T cell dysfunction is a critical barrier to anti-tumor immunity, but molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of T cell dysfunction in solid tumors are diverse and complex. Extracellular matrix (ECM) composition facilitates solid tumor progression in part by inhibiting T cell migration/infiltration; however, the impact of individual ECM molecules on T cell function in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is virtually unknown. Moreover, upstream regulators of aberrant ECM deposition/organization in solid tumors are poorly defined. Therefore, we investigated the regulation and effects of ECM composition on CD8+ T cell function in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). This immunologically \"hot\" soft-tissue sarcoma exhibits durable responses to checkpoint therapy in some human patients, suggesting it may provide insights into strategies for optimizing T cell function and improving immunotherapy efficacy. Using an autochthonous model of UPS and data from multiple human patient cohorts, we discovered a multi-pronged mechanism wherein oncogene-induced remodeling of the TME promotes CD8+ T cell dysfunction, suppresses T cell-mediated cytolysis, and enhances immune evasion. Specifically, we observed that the transcriptional co-activator Yap1, which we previously linked to UPS progression, promotes the aberrant deposition of collagen VI in the UPS TME. In turn, collagen VI induces CD8+ T cell dysfunction by inhibiting T cell autophagic flux and remodeling fibrillar collagen architecture in the TME. Furthermore, collagen type I opposed ColVI in this setting, acting as tumor suppressor. Thus, our findings reveal that CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity in solid cancers is dependent upon oncogene-mediated ECM composition and remodeling in the TME.",

    "abstract": "Checkpoint immunotherapy unleashes T cell antitumor potential which has revolutionized cancer treatment showing unprecedented long-term responses. However, most patients do not respond to immunotherapy which often correlates with a dysfunctional or immunosuppressive myeloid compartment. The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is a sub-class of myeloid cells comprising monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells which plays a crucial role in tissue homeostasis. However, accumulating evidence suggests that mononuclear phagocytes contribute to all phases of tumorigenesis including orchestrating inflammatory events during de novo carcinogenesis, contribution to the progression of established tumors and promotion of resistance to checkpoint blockade. Thus, targeting the MPS could be an effective strategy to enhance checkpoint blockade efficacy and promote control of tumors. Here, we found that protein kinase C delta (PKC{delta}), a serine/threonine kinase, is abundantly expressed by mononuclear phagocytes in several human and mouse tumors. PKC{delta}-/- mice were more resistant to growth of various cancers compared to wild-type mice and were more responsive to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Furthermore, we found that tumors from PKC{delta}-/- mice harbor a Th-1-skewed immune landscape including increased antigen cross-presentation and T cell activation. Depletion of mononuclear phagocytes in vivo altered tumor growth in wild-type mice, but not in PKC{delta}-/- mice. In addition, coinjection of PKC{delta}-/--deficient M2-like macrophages with cancer cells into wild-type mice markedly delayed tumor growth and significantly increased intratumoral T cell activation compared to wild-type M2-like macrophages coinjected with cancer cells. Finally, intrinsic loss of PKC{delta}-/- functionally reprogrammed macrophages and dendritic cells by promoting their antigen presenting and cross-presenting capacity and triggered type I and type II interferon signaling. Thus, PKC{delta} might be targeted to reprogram mononuclear phagocytes and augment checkpoint blockade efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The global burden of fungal infections is alarming, primarily due to the increasing immune-compromised population. The immuno-preventive/therapeutic measures, including vaccines, are necessary to prevent or control fungal diseases. Identifying a protective host element as a functional phenotypic marker is immensely valuable. We identified a host element, sialophorin, preferentially associated with antifungal memory T cells. We investigated its role in vaccine immunity using a mouse model of pulmonary fungal infection. We found that sialophorin was essential to bolster CD8+ T-cell responses to the vaccine by enhancing their differentiation and expanding cytokine-producing cells required for immunity. Using a gain-of-function approach, activating sialophorin using mAb augmented the CD8+ T cell responses, and sialophorin-sufficient CD8+ T cells were competitively superior in differentiation and expansion to the deficient cells. Sialophorin-mediated vaccine immunity was independent of the T cell trafficking effect. Finally, we show that sialophorin is a potential functional phenotypic marker of fungal vaccine-potency and immunity. Our study revealed that sialophorin is an essential host-target element to bolster vaccine responses and serves as a potential biomarker of fungal immunity.\n\nAuthor SummaryFungal infections have been rising in recent years due to increased immunocompromised individuals. Vaccination of at-risk individuals helps counter the infections. Thus, suitable vaccine platforms are needed with apt adjuvants, and a phenotypic marker of vaccine immunity will bolster the efforts. We identified a phenotypic marker, sialophorin, associated with T cell vaccine immunity to fungal infection. Our findings show an essential role of sialophorin for fungal immunity, as a target of adjuvanticity, and as a potential biomarker of vaccine immunity against many fungal infections.",

Chemical and metabolic interference with ROS production decrease T-loop phosphorylation on CDK2, impeding its full activation and thus efficient DNA replication. ROS regulate CDK2 activity through oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue in close proximity to the T-loop, which prevents binding of the T-loop phosphatase KAP.

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has recently been shown to provide a powerful method for the analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. A potential drawback of current scRNA-seq platforms is that the cost can limit the complexity of experimental design and therefore the utility of the approach. In this manuscript, we report the use of oligonucleotide barcoding to perform multiplexed CHO cell scRNA-seq to study the impact of tunicamycin (TM), an inducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR). For this experiment, we treated a CHO-K1 GS cell line with 10g/ml tunicamycin and acquired samples at 1, 2, 4 and 8 hr post-treatment as well as a non-treated TM-control. We transfected cells with sample-specific polyadenylated ssDNA oligonucleotide barcodes enabling us to pool all cells for scRNA-seq. The sample from which each cell originated was subsequently determined by the oligonucleotide barcode sequence. Visualisation of the transcriptome data in a reduced dimensional space confirmed that cells were not only separable by sample but were also distributed according to time post-treatment. These data were subsequently utilised to perform weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) and uncovered groups of genes associated with TM treatment. For example, the expression of one group of coexpressed genes was found to increase over the time course and were enriched for biological processes associated with ER stress. The use of multiplexed single cell RNA-seq has the potential to reduce the cost associated with higher sample numbers and avoid batch effects for future studies of CHO cell biology.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPolyadenylated ssDNA oligonucleotide labelling is a viable strategy for multiplexed CHO cell scRNA-seq analysis.\nC_LIO_LITo demonstrate the effectiveness of the method we conducted an experiment to study the CHO cell response to tunicamycin treatment.\nC_LIO_LIscRNA-seq was carried out on an untreated control and at 4 time points post tunicamycin treatment.

Three gene coexpression modules were found to be correlated with the tunicamycin time course.

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have been reported to exhibit two stages of pluripotency,  primed and  naive states. Typical human PSCs (hPSCs) are in the primed state. Though several methods for conversion from primed to naive state have been reported, the mechanism of the process is not fully understood. Here, we report that 5 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream p38 is a signaling axis that can induce the naive conversion of hPSCs with single pathway activation. The simple addition of an AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-{beta}-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), or overexpression of a constitutive active form of p38 (CA-p38) alone in primed hPSCs induced naive hPSCs that satisfied naive state criteria: differentiation ability to three germ layers and naive state-specific transcriptional expression, epigenomic resetting, and mitochondrial activity. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that our AICAR- or CA-p38-induced naive hPSCs show closely similar gene expression patterns to naive state human embryonic stem cells (HNES1) derived from human inner cell mass (ICM). This novel and simple naive conversion method provides new avenues for understanding and elucidating the fundamental mechanism of naive conversion.",

    "abstract": "Degradation and recycling of plasma membrane-localized proteins occurs via the endolysosomal system, wherein endosomes bud into the cytosol from the plasma membrane and subsequently mature into degradative lysosomal compartments. The endolysosomal system also participates in intracellular membrane protein trafficking, signaling, and protein degradation via autophagy. Our understanding of the endolysosomal system has been significantly advanced through the development of methods for selective capture of lysosomes (termed Lyso-IP), but methods for analogous isolation of early intermediates in the endolysosomal system are lacking. Here, we develop an approach for rapid isolation of early/sorting endosomes through affinity capture of the early endosome-associated protein EEA1 (Endo-IP) and provide proteomic and lipidomic snapshots of early endosomes in action. In addition to resident endosomal components, we identify numerous recycling, regulatory and membrane fusion complexes as well as candidate cargo, providing a proteomic landscape of early/sorting endosomes that we distinguished from lysosomes via comparative proteomics. The approach allows capture of internalized transferrin within minutes of its addition to cells, indicating the utility of the approach for dynamic analysis of early/sorting endosomes. Among the endocytic cargo identified by Endo-IP was the amyloid precursor protein (APP) genetically linked with Alzheimers disease. Processing of APP to amyloidogenic A{beta} peptides by {beta}- and {gamma}-Secretases can occur within the endolysosomal system among other compartments, but methods for spatial quantification of A{beta} products in individual organelles are lacking. We combined Endo- and Lyso-IP with targeted proteomics to provide a spatial digital snapshot of A{beta} products. This analysis revealed that products of A{beta} processing by {beta}- and {gamma}-Secretases, and alterations in the specificity of cleavage by small molecule {gamma}-Secretase modulators, can be quantified in both early/sorting endosomes and lysosomes. We anticipate that the Endo-IP approach will facilitate systematic interrogation of the many processes that are coordinated on early endosomes.",

    "abstract": "Caveolae are small coated inner plasma membrane invaginations found in many cell types. Their diverse functions span from endocytosis to signaling, regulating key cellular processes including lipid uptake, pathogen entry, and membrane tension. Caveolae undergo shape changes from flat to curved. It is unclear which proteins regulate this process. To address this gap, we studied the shapes of caveolae with platinum replica electron microscopy in six common cell types. Next, we developed a correlative multi-color stimulated emission depletion (STED) fluorescence and platinum replica EM imaging (CLEM) method to image caveolae-associated proteins at caveolae of different shapes at the nanoscale. Caveolins and cavins were found at all caveolae, independent of their curvature. EHD2, a classic caveolar neck protein, was strongly detected at both curved and flat caveolae. Both pacsin2 and the regulator EHBP1 were found only at a subset of caveolae. Pacsin2 was localized primarily to areas surrounding flat caveolae, whereas EHBP1 was mostly detected at spheres. Contrary to classic models, dynamin was absent from caveolae and localized only to clathrin-coated structures. Cells lacking dynamin showed no substantial changes to caveolae, suggesting that dynamin is not directly involved in caveolae curvature. Together, we provide a mechanistic map for the molecular control of caveolae shape by eight of the major caveolae-associated coat and regulatory proteins. We propose a model where caveolins, cavins, and EHD2 assemble as a cohesive structural unit regulated by more intermittent associations with pacsin2 and EHBP1. These complexes can flatten and curve, capturing membrane to enable lipid traffic and changes to the surface area of the cell.",
