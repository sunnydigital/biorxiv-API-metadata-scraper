    "abstract": "One of the goals of population genetics is to understand how evolutionary forces shape patterns of genetic variation over time. However, because populations evolve across both time and space, most evolutionary processes also have an important spatial component, acting through phenomena such as isolation by distance, local mate choice, or uneven distribution of resources. This spatial dimension is often neglected, partly due to the lack of tools specifically designed for building and evaluating complex spatio-temporal population genetic models. To address this methodological gap, we present a new framework for simulating spatially-explicit genomic data, implemented in a new R package called slendr (www.slendr.net), which leverages a SLiM simulation back-end script bundled with the package. With this framework, the users can programmatically and visually encode spatial population ranges and their temporal dynamics (i.e., population displacements, expansions, and contractions) either on real Earth landscapes or on abstract custom maps, and schedule splits and gene-flow events between populations using a straightforward declarative language. Additionally, slendr can simulate data from traditional, non-spatial models, either with SLiM or using an alternative built-in coalescent msprime back end. Together with its R-idiomatic interface to the tskit library for tree-sequence processing and analysis, slendr opens up the possibility of performing efficient, reproducible simulations of spatio-temporal genomic data entirely within the R environment, leveraging its wealth of libraries for geospatial data analysis, statistics, and visualization. Here, we present the design of the slendr R package and demonstrate its features on several practical example workflows.",

    "abstract": "Plants make a variety of specialized metabolites that can mediate interactions with animals, microbes and competitor plants. Understanding how plants synthesize these compounds enables studies of their biological roles by manipulating their synthesis in vivo as well as producing them in vitro. Acylsugars are a group of protective metabolites that accumulate in the trichomes of many Solanaceae family plants. Acylinositol biosynthesis is of interest because it appears to be restricted to a subgroup of species within the Solanum genus. Previous work characterized a triacylinositol acetyltransferase involved in acylinositol biosynthesis in the Andean fruit plant Solanum quitoense (lulo or naranjillo). We characterized three additional S. quitoense trichome expressed enzymes, and found that virus induced gene silencing of each caused changes in acylinositol accumulation. Surprisingly, the in vitro triacylinositol products of these enzymes are distinct from those that accumulate in planta. These enzymes, nonetheless, provide an opportunities to test the biological impact and properties of these triacylinositols in vitro.",

    "abstract": "The fragmented sleep, fragmented mind hypothesis has associated sleep disturbances and dissociative states in subjects with dissociative traits, as supported by neurophysiological theories of consciousness stating that altered states might result from an altered functional interaction among brain modules due to inefficient sleep processes.\n\nIrrespective of dissociative traits, it is conceivable that a labile sleep-wake cycle might fuel dissociative states such as derealization, depersonalization, and dissociative amnesia.\n\nTo verify whether acute sleep loss can prompt dissociative states and to identify possible psychophysiological correlates, we evaluated dissociative experiences (by means of Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory and Clinician Administered Dissociative State Scale) and resting state EEG features (band-wise spectral content and phase synchronization) after total sleep deprivation.\n\nAfter deprivation, participants reported increased perception of altered state of consciousness and dissociative experiences, and a decreased perception of cognitive control. Analyzing the psychophysiological correlates of dissociative states following deprivation, we observed the following results: the higher the prefrontal theta spectral content, the higher the depersonalization state and the lower the self-awareness; the higher the intensity of the dissociative experiences, the higher the synchronization increase in alpha, beta, and gamma bands; the higher the decrease of higher-order functions, the higher the synchronization in the aforementioned bands.\n\nThus, acute sleep deprivation appears to fuel dissociative experiences by establishing a state of consciousness promoted by a higher large-scale synchronization at high frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the greatest known genetic risk factor for developing late- onset Alzheimers disease and its expression in microglia is associated with pro- inflammatory states. How the interaction of APOE4 microglia with neurons differs from microglia expressing the disease-neutral allele APOE3 is currently unknown. Here, we employ CRISPR-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to dissect the impact of APOE4 in neuron-microglia communication. Our results reveal that APOE4 induces a distinct metabolic program in microglia that is marked by the accumulation of intracellular neutral lipid stores through impaired lipid catabolism. Importantly, this altered lipid-accumulated state shifts microglia away from homeostatic surveillance and renders APOE4 microglia weakly responsive to neuronal activity. By examining the transcriptional signatures of APOE3 versus APOE4 microglia before and after exposure to neuronal conditioned media, we further established that neuronal soluble cues differentially induce a lipogenic program in APOE4 microglia that exacerbates pro- inflammatory signals. Pharmacological blockade of lipogenesis in APOE4 microglia is sufficient to diminish intracellular lipid accumulation and restore microglial homeostasis. Remarkably, unlike APOE3 microglia that support neuronal network activity, co-culture of APOE4 microglia with neurons disrupts the coordinated activity of neuronal ensembles. We identified that through decreased uptake of extracellular fatty acids and lipoproteins, APOE4 microglia disrupts the net flux of lipids which results in decreased neuronal activity via the potentiation of the lipid-gated K+ channel, GIRK3. These findings suggest that neurological diseases that exhibit abnormal neuronal network-level disturbances may in part be triggered by impairment in lipid homeostasis in non-neuronal cells, underscoring a novel therapeutic route to restore circuit function in the diseased brain.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484146v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d4a9corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5d888corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afa191org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@984340_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) and chronic adolescent cannabis use are both risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, exposure to a single risk factor may not result in major mental illness, indicating that multiple exposures may be required for illness onset. Here, we examine whether combined exposure to prenatal MIA and adolescent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, lead to enduring neuroanatomical and behavioural changes in adulthood.\n\nMethodsMice were prenatally exposed to viral mimetic, poly I:C (5mg/kg), or vehicle at gestational day (GD)9, and postnatally exposed to chronic THC (5mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle during adolescence (postnatal day [PND]28-45). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed pre-treatment, PND25, post-treatment, PND50, and in adulthood, PND85, followed by behavioural tests for anxiety-like, social, and sensorimotor gating. Postmortem assessment of cannabinoid (CB)1 and 2 receptor expressing cells was performed in altered regions identified by MRI (anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortices, striatum, and hippocampus).\n\nResultsSubtle deviations in neurodevelopmental trajectory and subthreshold anxiety-like behaviours were observed in mice exposed to both risk factors. Sex-dependent effects were observed in patterns of shared brain-behaviour covariation, indicative of potential sex differences in response to MIA and THC. Density of CB1 and CB2 receptor positive cells was significantly decreased in all mice exposed to MIA, THC, or both.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that there may be a cumulative effect of risk factor exposure on gross neuroanatomical development, and that the endocannabinoid system may be sensitive to both prenatal MIA, adolescent THC, or the combination.",

One of its subdivisions, the medial pulvinar, is connected to many cortical areas, including the visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices, as well as with multisensory areas and premotor areas. However, except for the visual modality, little is known about its sensory functions. A hypothesis is that, as a region of convergence of information from different sensory modalities, the medial pulvinar plays a role in multisensory integration. To test this hypothesis, two macaque monkeys were trained to a fixation task and the responses of single-units to visual, auditory and auditory-visual stimuli were examined. Analysis revealed auditory, visual and multisensory neurons in the medial pulvinar. It also revealed multisensory integration in this structure, mainly subadditive and suppressive. These findings show that the medial pulvinar is involved in multisensory integration.",

    "abstract": "Amyloids were long viewed as irreversible, pathological aggregates, often associated with neurodegenerative diseases1. However, recent insights challenge this view, providing evidence that reversible amyloids can form upon stress conditions and fulfil crucial cellular functions2. Yet, the molecular mechanisms regulating functional amyloids and the differences to their pathological counterparts remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the conserved principles of amyloid reversibility by studying the essential metabolic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) in yeast and human cells. We demonstrate that PK forms stress-dependent reversible amyloids through a pH-sensitive amyloid core. Stress- induced cytosolic acidification promotes aggregate formation via protonation of specific glutamate (in yeast) or histidine (in human) residues within the amyloid core. Our work thus unravels a conserved and potentially widespread mechanism underlying amyloid functionality and reversibility, fine-tuned to the respective physiological cellular pH range.",

    "abstract": "A widespread effect of climate change is the displacement of organisms from their thermal optima. The associated thermal stress imposed by climate change has been argued to have a particularly strong impact on male reproduction but evidence for this postulated sex-specific stress response is equivocal. One important factor that may explain intra- and interspecific variation in stress responses is sexual selection, which is predicted to magnify negative effects of stress. Nevertheless, empirical studies exploring the interplay of sexual selection and heat stress are still scarce. We tested experimentally for an interaction between sexual selection and thermal stress in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum by contrasting heat responses in male and female reproductive success between setups of enforced monogamy versus polygamy. We found that polygamy magnifies detrimental effects of heat stress in males but relaxes the observed negative effects in females. Our results suggest that sexual selection can reverse sex differences in thermal sensitivity, and may therefore alter sex-specific selection on alleles associated with heat tolerance. We argue that these findings have important implications for predicting the role of sexual selection for the adaptation to current global warming and increased frequency of extreme climatic events.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfectious Salmonid Anaemia virus (ISAV) is an orthomyxovirus responsible of large losses in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture. Current available treatments and vaccines are not fully effective, and therefore selective breeding to produce ISAV-resistant strains of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a high priority for the industry. Genomic selection and potentially genome editing can be applied to enhance the disease resistance of aquaculture stocks, and both approaches can benefit from increased knowledge on the genomic mechanisms of resistance to ISAV. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance to ISAV in Atlantic salmon we performed a transcriptomic study in ISAV-infected salmon with contrasting levels of resistance to this virus.\n\nResultsThree different tissues (gills, head kidney and spleen) were collected on 12 resistant and 12 susceptible fish at three timepoints (pre-challenge, 7 and 14 days post infection) and RNA sequenced. The transcriptomes of Infected and non-infected fish and of resistant and susceptible fish were compared at each timepoint. The results show that the responses to ISAV are organ-specific; an important response to the infection was observed in the head kidney, with up-regulation of immune processes such as interferon and NLR pathways, while in gills and spleen the response was more moderate. In addition to immune related genes our results suggest that other processes such as ubiquitination or ribosomal processing are important during early infection to ISAV. Moreover, the comparison between resistant and susceptible have also highlighted some interesting genes related to ubiquitination, intracellular transport or the inflammasome.\n\nConclusionsAtlantic salmon infection by ISAV revealed an organ-specific response, implying differential function during the infection. An early immune response was observed in the head kidney, while gills and spleen showed modest responses in comparison. Comparison between resistance and susceptible samples have highlighted genes of interest for further studies, for instance those related to ubiquitination or the inflammasome.",

    "abstract": "The co-digestion of residues from the sugarcane industry has already proven to be a highly attractive process for biogas production through anaerobic digestion (AD). The use of residues such as vinasse (1G) filter cake (1G) and deacetylation liquor (2G) in CSTR operation showed the potential for integrating 1G and 2G ethanol biorefineries through AD in previous work by our research group. The use of nanoparticles (NP) is a favorable way to optimize AD processes, as these additives allow the introduction of nutrients to the process more assertively concerning the distribution and interaction with microorganisms. The present work proposed the optimization of the co-digestion of vinasse, filter cake, and deacetylation liquor in a continuous reactor by adding Fe3O4 NP, comparing the results with a previous reactor operation without NP. Initially, tests were carried out in batches with different NP concentrations, resulting in 5 mg L-1 as the best concentration to be added in the continuous reactor along the increments of the applied organic rate load (ORL). CH4 production reached a maximum value of 2.8 {+/-} 0.1 NLCH4 gVS-1 and the organic matter removal reached 71 {+/-} 0.9%, in phase VI (ORL of 5.5 gVS L-1 day-1). This production was 90% higher than the reactor co-digestion operation without NP. The pH and alkalinity results indicated the methanogenesis stabilization within 60 days of operation: 30 days before when there was no NP added. The AD development was stable, presenting low variations in the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and stable organic acid (OA) concentrations, which indicated the propionic acid route to produce CH4 was predominant. The main methanogenic Archeae identified was Methanoculleus, indicating that the predominant metabolic route was that of acetate (SAO) coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The use of Fe3O4 NP managed to improve the AD from the 1G2G ethanol production residues and stimulated the microbial community growth, not modifying the preferable metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWTime implicitly shapes cognition, but time is also explicitly represented, for instance in the form of durations. Parsimoniously, the brain could use the same mechanisms for implicit and explicit timing. Yet, the evidence has been equivocal, revealing both joint versus separate signatures of timing. Here, we directly compared implicit and explicit timing using magnetoencephalography, whose temporal resolution allows investigating the different stages of the timing processes. Implicit temporal predictability was induced in an auditory paradigm by a manipulation of the foreperiod. Participants received two consecutive task instructions: discriminate pitch (indirect measure of implicit timing) or duration (direct measure of explicit timing). The results show that the human brain efficiently extracts implicit temporal statistics of sensory environments, to enhance the behavioral and neural responses to auditory stimuli, but that those temporal predictions did not improve explicit timing. In both tasks, attentional orienting in time during predictive foreperiods was indexed by an increase in alpha power over visual and parietal areas. Furthermore, pre-target induced beta power in sensorimotor and parietal areas increased during implicit compared to explicit timing, in line with the suggested role for beta oscillations in temporal prediction. Interestingly, no distinct neural dynamics emerged when participants explicitly paid attention to time, compared to implicit timing. Our work thus indicates that implicit timing shapes the behavioral and sensory response in an automatic way, and is reflected in oscillatory neural dynamics, while the translation of implicit temporal statistics to explicit durations remains somewhat inconclusive, possibly due to the more abstract nature of this task.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that can infect many different host species and is a cause of significant human morbidity worldwide. T. gondii secretes a diverse array of effector proteins into the host cell which are critical for infection; however, the vast majority of these secreted proteins are uncharacterised. Here, we carried out a pooled CRISPR knockout screen in the T. gondii Prugniaud strain in vivo to identify secreted proteins that contribute to parasite immune evasion in the host. We identify 22 putative virulence factors and demonstrate that ROP1, the first-identified rhoptry protein of T. gondii, has a previously unrecognised role in parasite resistance to interferon gamma-mediated innate immune restriction. This function is conserved in the highly virulent RH strain of T. gondii and contributes to parasite growth in both murine and human macrophages. While ROP1 affects the morphology of rhoptries, from where the protein is secreted, it does not affect rhoptry secretion. ROP1 interacts with the host cell protein C1QBP, which appears to facilitate parasite immune evasion. In summary, we identify 22 secreted proteins which contribute to parasite growth in vivo and show that ROP1 is an important and previously overlooked effector in counteracting both murine and human innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Interaction of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with specific single-stranded RNA and its relation to liquid-liquid phase separation were investigated in vitro by magnetic resonance based on site-directed spin labelling. An ensemble model of free hnRNP A1 in the absence of RNA was derived from distance distributions between spin labelled sites and small angle X-ray scattering. This model revealed a compact state of the low-complexity domain and interaction of this domain with the RNA recognition motifs. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR spectroscopy confirmed this interaction. The addition of RNA to dispersed solutions of hnRNP A1 induced phase separation, observed by formation of liquid droplets. The phase separation depended on the RNA concentration and sequence, with continuous wave EPR spectroscopy showing that local protein dynamics is affected by point mutations in the RNA sequence. We propose that an interplay of sequence-specific RNA binding and phase transition serves as a regulatory mechanism for RNA segregation in the stress response of cells.",

    "abstract": "Dynein motors are microtubule associated protein complexes that mediate multiple essential cellular processes, such as long-distance cargo trafficking and stabilization of the microtubule organization center. Most of these functions and their regulations depend on the dynein motor subunit dynactin. By using an infection-inducible system, we disrupted dynein motor function after HSV entry by overexpressing a dominant-negative inhibitor of dynein, resulting in a 5-fold growth defect in Vero cells and 1000-fold growth defect in CAD neuronal cells. Also, we found that in infected CAD cells, the dynein complex was recruited to viral assembly sites regardless of microtubule polymerization. Based on these observations, we then identified a novel interaction between conserved HSV-1 tegument protein pUL51 and p150Glued. pUL51 is a palmitoylated Golgi membrane-associated protein that is required for efficient virus assembly and spread. Overexpression of pUL51 alone was sufficient to recruit p150Glued to Golgi membranes. Sequences that are important and sufficient for pUL51-p150Glued interaction were mapped to residues 90 to 124 in pUL51 and residues 548 to 911 in p150Glued. Deletion of a.a 90-124 in pUL51 resulted in a moderate viral growth defect, a profound spread defect, and failure to accumulate both dynactin and the viral spread factor glycoprotein E (gE) at cell-cell junctions. A synthetic peptide that contains pUL51 a.a 90-125 could also inhibit viral growth and spread in pUL51-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that the proper function of pUL51 in efficient viral assembly and spread depends on its interaction with p150Glued.\n\nAuthor SummaryDuring their life-long infections, herpesviruses can spread within the human body in spite of a powerful immune response that includes antibodies that inactivate the virus. The virus accomplishes this by targeting its newly made infectious particles to junctions where infected cells meet their uninfected neighbors. Junctional targeting of virus particles requires that the virus hijack normal cellular machinery used for moving large cargoes within the cell, a process that is only partially understood. In this study, we have discovered a critical interaction between a virus protein that is present in all herpesviruses and a host cell cargo-moving protein that is required for virus spread between cells and shown that this interaction is common to several medically important human herpesviruses. We have also identified a short piece of this virus protein that is responsible for the interaction and shown that this short piece can be used to interrupt the interaction and prevent spread of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in cultured cells. Our study provides prove-of-concept evidence that the spread pathway of HSV, and possibly other herpesviruses, can be targeted for therapeutic purposes.",

    "abstract": "Introgression is a common evolutionary phenomenon that results in shared genetic material across non-sister taxa. Existing statistical methods such as Pattersons D statistic can detect introgression by measuring an excess of shared derived alleles between populations. The D statistic is effective to detect genome-wide patterns of introgression but can give spurious inferences of introgression when applied to local regions. We propose a new statistic, D+, that leverages both shared ancestral and derived alleles to infer local introgressed regions. Incorporating both shared derived and ancestral alleles increases the number of informative sites per region, improving our ability to identify local introgression. We use a coalescent framework to derive the expected value of this statistic as a function of different demographic parameters under an instantaneous admixture model and use coalescent simulations to compute the power and precision of D+. While the power of D and D+ is comparable, D+ has better precision than D. We apply D+ to empirical data from the 1000 Genome Project and Heliconius butterflies to infer local targets of introgression in humans and in butterflies.",

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a fatal neuromuscular disease characterized by motor neuron loss and advanced muscle weakness, which occurs in functional SMN (Survival Motor Neuron) protein deficiency with SMN1 gene-induced deletions and mutations. The incidence of SMA, which is an autosomal recessive disease, is 1/10,000 in the world. The SMN protein acts as a molecular chaperone in the formation of the spliceosome complex, which catalyzes the splicing of pre-mRNA, enabling mRNAs and non-coding RNAs to mature. Since the current SMN1-encoding Adeno-associated virus (AAV) or SMN2 gene targeting antisense oligonucleotide-based strategies cannot provide long-term stable SMN expression in neuron cells, more effective methods need to be developed. CRISPR technology, which adds a new dimension to genetic engineering and gene therapies, makes it possible to treat many genetic diseases. In terms of SMA, some previous studies in the literature prove that it is possible to treat SMA with the CRISPR strategy. Homology Directed Repair (HDR)-based CRISPR technology, which results in a high rate of in-del (insertion-deletion) mutations rather than editing, was shown unsuitable for therapeutic applications. CRISPR-Prime editing (PE) technology is a new generation of gene editing approach that precisely provides various genomic modifications without the need for double-strand breakage or donor DNA sequences. CRISPR-Prime Editing method has also been used in rare diseases such as sickle cell anemia and Tay-Sachs, and their efficiency in editing various pathogenic mutations has been demonstrated. However, CRISPR Prime Editing-mediated gene editing for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) have not yet been investigated. The c.840 T-C transition and c.859 G-C transformations in the SMN2 gene and the correction of these point mutations with a single pegRNA at the same time were investigated for the first time in this study. Here, we showed that CRISPR-PE systems could increase SMN2 gene activity and SMN protein expression by ensuring exon 7 participation by editing c.840 T-C transition and c.859 G-C transformations. The fact that Prime Editing method showed the efficacy and stability of modifications in SMN2 genes that were investigated in SMN-low Jurkat cells as a proof-of-concept. This study enabled the next step with the CRISPR-Prime Editing approach to be tested ex vivo in primary cell lines from SMA patients and SMN-low neuronal cells.",

Head-to-head comparisons of T cell, B cell, and antibody responses to diverse vaccines in humans are likely to be informative for understanding protective immunity against COVID-19, with particular interest in immune memory. Here, SARS-CoV-2-spike--specific immune responses to Moderna mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 were examined longitudinally for 6 months. 100% of individuals made memory CD4+ T cells, with cTfh and CD4-CTL highly represented after mRNA or NVX-CoV2373 vaccination. mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S induced comparable CD8+ T cell frequencies, though memory CD8+ T cells were only detectable in 60-67% of subjects at 6 months. Ad26.COV2.S was not the strongest immunogen by any measurement, though the Ad26.COV2.S T cell, B cell, and antibody responses were relatively stable over 6 months. A differentiating feature of Ad26.COV2.S immunization was a high frequency of CXCR3+ memory B cells. mRNA vaccinees had substantial declines in neutralizing antibodies, while memory T cells and B cells were comparatively stable over 6 months. These results of these detailed immunological evaluations may also be relevant for vaccine design insights against other pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic eukaryotic organelles involved in a variety of essential cellular processes including the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as in the control of apoptosis and autophagy. Impairments of mitochondrial functions lead to aging and disease. Previous works with the ascomycete Podospora anserina demonstrated that mitochondrial morphotype as well as mitochondrial ultrastructure change during aging. The latter goes along with an age-dependent reorganization of the inner mitochondrial membrane leading to a change from lamellar cristae to vesicular structures. Especially from studies with yeast it is known that beside the F1Fo-ATP-synthase and the phospholipid cardiolipin also the  mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, existing of the Mic60- and Mic10-subcomplex, is essential for proper cristae formation. In the present study, we aimed to understand the mechanistic basis of age-related changes of the mitochondrial ultrastructure. We observed that MICOS subunits are co-regulated at the posttranscriptional level. This regulation partially depends on the mitochondrial iAAA-protease PaIAP. Most surprisingly, we made the counterintuitive observation that, despite the loss of lamellar cristae and of mitochondrial impairments, the ablation of MICOS subunits (except of PaMIC12) leads to a pronounced lifespan extension. Moreover, simultaneous ablation of subunits of both MICOS subcomplexes synergistically increases lifespan, providing formal genetic evidence that both subcomplexes affect lifespan by different and at least partially independent pathways. At the molecular level we found that ablation of Mic10-subcomplex components leads to a mitohormesis-induced lifespan extension, while lifespan extension of Mic60-subcomplex mutants seems to be controlled by another pathway. Overall, our data demonstrate that both MICOS subcomplexes have different functions and play distinct roles in the aging process of P. anserina.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic steatosis associated with high fat diets, obesity and type 2 diabetes is thought to be the major driver of severe liver inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA), a central metabolite and substrate for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), is produced from citrate by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) and from acetate through AcCoA synthase short chain family member 2 (ACSS2). However, the relative contributions of these two enzymes to hepatic AcCoA pools and DNL rates in response to high fat feeding is unknown. We report here that hepatocyte-selective depletion of either ACSS2 or ACLY caused similar 50% decreases in liver AcCoA levels in obese mice, showing that both pathways contribute to generation of this DNL substrate. Unexpectedly however, the hepatocyte ACLY depletion in obese mice paradoxically increased total DNL flux measured by D2O incorporation into palmitate, while in contrast ACSS2 depletion had no effect. The increase in liver DNL upon ACLY depletion was associated with increased expression of nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and of its target DNL enzymes. This upregulated DNL enzyme expression explains the increased rate of palmitate synthesis in ACLY depleted livers. Furthermore, this increased flux through DNL may also contribute to the observed depletion of AcCoA levels due to its increased conversion to Malonyl CoA (MalCoA) and palmitate. Together, these data indicate that in HFD fed obese mice, hepatic DNL is not limited by its immediate substrates AcCoA or MalCoA, but rather by activities of DNL enzymes.",

In this study we report that insulin-immunoreactive cells with Paneth/goblet cell features are present in human fetal intestine, in addition to enteroendocrine cells.

They oxidize ingested nectar to directly fuel flight when foraging but have to switch to oxidizing stored lipids derived from ingested sugars during the night or long-distance migratory flights. Understanding how this organism moderates energy turnover is hampered by a lack of information regarding how relevant enzymes differ in sequence, expression, and regulation. To explore these questions, we generated a chromosome level de novo genome assembly of the ruby-throated hummingbird (A. colubris) using a combination of long and short read sequencing and scaffolding using other existing assemblies. We then used hybrid long and short-read RNA-sequencing for a comprehensive transcriptome assembly and annotation. Our genomic and transcriptomic data found positive selection of key metabolic genes in nectivorous avian species and a deletion of critical genes (GLUT4, GCK) involved in glucostasis in other vertebrates. We found expression of fructose-specific GLUT5 putatively in place of insulin-sensitive GLUT4, with predicted protein models suggesting affinity for both fructose and glucose. Alternative isoforms may even act to sequester fructose to preclude limitations from transport in metabolism. Finally, we identified differentially expressed genes from fasted and fed hummingbirds suggesting key pathways for the rapid metabolic switch hummingbirds undergo.",

    "abstract": "The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Irc3 protein is a mitochondrial Superfamily II DNA helicase that, according to genomic data, is conserved in different yeast species. Here we characterize Irc3 helicase from the thermotolerant yeast Ogataea polymorpha (Irc3op) that throughout its helicase motor domain has approximately 82% similarity with the S. cerevisiae protein. Irc3op retains enzymatic activity at considerably higher temperatures than Irc3sc, displaying the fastest rate of ATP hydrolysis at 41 {degrees}C and a Tm of 45.3 {degrees}C for its secondary structure melting. We demonstrate that Irc3op is a structure-specific DNA helicase translocating on both single- and double-stranded DNA molecules. Like the homolog of S. cerevisiae, Irc3op can unwind only DNA molecules that contain branched structures. Different DNA molecules containing three- and four-way branches are utilized by Irc3op as unwinding substrates. Importantly, the preferred unwinding substrate of Irc3op is a DNA fork containing the nascent lagging strand, suggesting a possible role in replication restart following a block in leading strand polymerization. A lower unwinding efficiency of four-way branched DNA molecules could explain why Irc3op only partially complements the irc3{Delta} phenotype in S. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "Engineered transactivation domains (TADs) combined with programmable DNA binding platforms have revolutionized synthetic transcriptional control. Despite recent progress in programmable CRISPR/Cas-based transactivation (CRISPRa) technologies, the TADs used in these systems often contain poorly tolerated elements and/or are prohibitively large for many applications. Here we defined and optimized minimal TADs built from human mechanosensitive transcription factors (MTFs). We used these components to construct potent and compact multipartite transactivation modules (MSN, NMS, and eN3x9) and to build the CRISPR-dCas9 recruited enhanced activation module (CRISPR-DREAM) platform. We found that CRISPR-DREAM was specific, robust across mammalian cell types, and efficiently stimulated transcription from diverse regulatory loci. We also showed that MSN and NMS were portable across Type I, II, and V CRISPR systems, TALEs, and ZF proteins. Further, as proofs of concepts, we used dCas9-NMS to efficiently reprogram human fibroblasts into iPSCs and demonstrated that MTF TADs are efficacious and well tolerated in therapeutically important primary human cell types. Finally, we leveraged the compact and potent features of these engineered TADs to build new dual and all-in-one CRISPRa AAV systems. Altogether, these compact human TADs, fusion modules, and new delivery architectures should be valuable for synthetic transcriptional control in biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "CD81 is a tetraspanin receptor that clusters into microdomains to mediate cell signalling processes. CD81 is also one of the four primary cellular receptors of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Previous structural studies on the -helical CD81 large-extracellular-loop domain (CD81LEL) have shown that it can adopt different conformations (from closed to open), likely depending on the environmental conditions. This conformational plasticity has been implicated in the endosomal fusion of HCV upon entry. However, the precise mechanism governing the CD81LEL plasticity has remained elusive so far.\n\nHere, by combining molecular dynamics simulations and circular dichroism experiments on wt-CD81LEL and two mutants at different endosomal pH conditions, pH 5.5 and pH 4.6, we show that the modulation of the solvation shell governs the plasticity of CD81LEL. The primarily implicated residues are D139 and E188, respectively, located near a loop preceded by a helix. At acidic conditions, their interaction with water is reduced, causing a re-ordering of the water molecules, and thus triggering the dynamics of CD81LEL. However, mutations E188Q and D139N retain the solvation shell and restrict the conformational space that the head subdomain can explore.\n\nWe propose that residues E188 and D139 control the solvent-induced allosteric transition of the CD81LEL domain. This mechanism might play a role in other cellular receptors that function along the endosomal pathway.\n\nPopular SummaryUnderstanding the cellular mechanisms that are exploited by viruses to infect their host is key for the development of therapeutics. Here, in the context of Hepatitis C Virus infection we report the mechanism that governs the plasticity of the extra-cellular domain of tetraspanin CD81, one of the major cellular receptors of this virus. The mechanism proposed here is a novel form of solvent-induced allosteric transition in proteins mediated by two antenna residues located in the head subdomain of CD81. We propose that it could serve as a pH sensing strategy to time the endosomal pathway and trigger a signal at the right time for HCV fusion.",

    "abstract": "The cell autonomous balance of immune-inhibitory and -stimulatory signals is a critical yet poorly understood process in cancer immune evasion. Using patient-derived co-culture models and humanized mouse models, we show that an intact CD58:CD2 interaction is necessary for anti-tumor immunity. Defects in this axis lead to multi-faceted immune evasion through impaired CD2-dependent T cell polyfunctionality, T cell exclusion, impaired intra-tumoral proliferation, and concurrent protein stabilization of PD-L1. We performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 and CD58 coimmunoprecipitation mass spectrometry screens identifying CMTM6 as a key stabilizer of CD58, and show that CMTM6 is required for concurrent upregulation of PD-L1 in CD58 loss. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of patient melanoma samples demonstrates that most TILs lack expression of primary costimulatory signals required for response to PD-1 blockade (e.g. CD28), but maintain strong CD2 expression, thus providing an opportunity to mobilize a so far therapeutically untapped pool of TILs for anti-tumor immunity. We identify two potential therapeutic avenues, including rescued activation of human CD2-expressing TILs using recombinant CD58 protein, and targeted disruption of PD-L1/CMTM6 interactions. Our work identifies an underappreciated yet critical axis at the nexus of cancer immunity and evasion, uncovers a fundamental mechanism of co-inhibitory and -stimulatory signal balancing, and provides new approaches to improving cancer immunotherapies.",

However, spatio-temporal NB progression in the TH-MYCN model has not been studied, and questions remain about the value of implanted models as a surrogate for transgenic mice. In this work, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study tumor progression and nanoparticle contrast-enhanced computed tomography (n-CECT) to assess tumor vascular architecture in TH-MYCN transgenic mice (2-7 weeks of age) and TH-MYCN+/+-derived orthotopic allograft and syngeneic mice (2-5 weeks post-tumor implantation). Tumors in TH-MYCN transgenic mice became evident in the abdominal paraspinal region at week 5. A delayed thoracic paraspinal mass became evident at week 6 and most mice succumbed by week 7. In allograft and syngeneic mice, single mass tumor growth was restricted to the peritoneal cavity. N-CECT revealed a predominantly microvascular network in TH-MYCN tumors while implanted tumors exhibited heterogeneous and tortuous vessels. N-CECT quantitative analysis demonstrated high vascularity (tumor fractional blood volume ~ 0.12) in all models. Multi-modal imaging of TH-MYCN transgenic and implanted models revealed differences in growth patterns and vascular architecture that should be considered in designing preclinical studies.",

    "abstract": "In malaria-endemic areas, subjects from specific groups like Fulani have a peculiar protection against malaria, with high levels of IgM but also frequent anemia and splenomegaly. The mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain elusive. In Benin, West Africa, we measured the deformability of circulating erythrocytes in genetically distinct groups (including Fulani) living in sympatry, using ektacytometry and microsphiltration, a mimic of how the spleen clears rigid erythrocytes. Compared to non-Fulani, Fulani displayed a higher deformability of circulating erythrocytes, pointing to an enhanced clearance of rigid erythrocytes by the spleen. This phenotype was observed in individuals displaying markers of Plasmodium falciparum infection. The heritability of this new trait was high, with a strong multigenic component. Five of the top 10 genes selected by a population structure-adjusted GWAS, expressed in the spleen, are potentially involved in splenic clearance of erythrocytes (CHERP, MB, PALLD, SPARC, PDE10A), through control of vascular tone, collagen synthesis and macrophage activity. In specific ethnic groups, genetically-controlled processes likely enhance the innate retention of infected and uninfected erythrocytes in the spleen, explaining splenomegaly, anemia, cryptic intrasplenic parasite loads, hyper-IgM, and partial protection against malaria. Beyond malaria-related phenotypes, inherited splenic hyper-filtration of erythrocytes may impact the pathogenesis of other hematologic diseases.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe genetic background of individuals influences their susceptibility to infectious diseases. Specific human groups, like the Fulani in Africa, react to malaria parasites (named Plasmodium) in a specific way. Upon infection, Fulani develop a grossly enlarged spleen, and high levels of anti-Plasmodium antibodies in their blood. They also carry smaller numbers of parasites in their blood, and thus are considered partially protected against malaria. The mechanisms underlying this natural protection, different from other natural protective mechanisms such as the sickle cell trait, are not well understood.\n\nMalaria impairs the deformability of red blood cells and the spleen is a key organ to controlling red blood cell quality. We have recently demonstrated that red blood cells containing live malaria parasites accumulate intensely in the spleen of subjects with long term exposure to these parasites. Enhanced retention of infected and uninfected red blood cells in the spleen would explain why the spleen is larger and why lower numbers of parasites are left in circulation. We thus explored whether the retention of infected and uninfected red blood cells could explain why Fulani are partially protected against malaria. Because it is unethical to perform spleen puncture or biopsies for research purposes, our explorations were indirect by carefully analyzing the properties of circulating red blood cells in a large number of subjects and by assessing whether observations could be explained by their genetic make-up.\n\nAdded value of this studyIn more than 500 subjects, we confirmed the high frequency of large spleens in Fulani and, through 2 different methods, we demonstrated an enhanced deformability of their circulating red blood cells, that likely stems from the more efficient removal of the less deformable ones. This enhanced deformability was found to be inheritable based on carefully collected family links and refined analysis of genetic markers.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur findings indicate that genes potentially driving the filtration of red blood cells by the spleen likely influence how subjects in specific groups in Africa and elsewhere react to malaria. While most previous hypotheses pointed to conventional immunological mechanisms as the trigger, we propose that a simple physiological mechanism that controls the quality of red blood cells may drive natural protection from malaria even before the intervention of immunological cells. A better understanding of these processes is of great importance in the context of malaria elimination efforts.\n\nThese findings may also have an impact on the understanding of other red blood cell-related disorders, such as inherited red cell diseases, in which splenic filtration of abnormal red blood cells may precipitate splenic complications.",

    "abstract": "Our previous work found that the RNA binding protein polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) is critical for regulating multiple events in T cell activation including changes in proliferation, and expression of activation markers and cytokines. These changes corresponded to the regulation of the ERK1/2 and NF-{kappa}B pathways as well as through changes in steady-state RNA levels. Because proliferation is critical for driving T cell activation, it was unclear whether PTBP1 was required for optimal activation per se or whether changes were secondary to a requirement for initiating/sustaining proliferation. To address this question, the human T cell lymphoma cell line, Jurkat, which recapitulates many of the molecular events of TCR-induced activation, was used to understand how PTBP1 impacts early events in T cell activation with ongoing proliferation. Using two phenotypically distinct Jurkat subclones (D1.1 and B2.7), we first profiled global RNA expression patterns using RNAseq analysis and found marked differences between the two cell lines with the D1.1 line giving a more antigen-experienced phenotype. Reducing PTBP1 by shPTB expression, to 60% WT levels resulted in no significant decrease in proliferation in the two subclones. However, we observed that PTBP1 was required for both optimal expression of activation markers, CD25, CD38, CD69, and CD40L, and signaling through the ERK1/2, P38 and AKT pathways. Importantly, limiting PTBP1 had different effects on the activation signals for each cell line suggesting that the differentiation state of the cell is a critical factor in understanding the role of PTBP1 in T cell activation. This was further reinforced by our finding that PTBP1 regulated distinct groups of genes specific for each line. Together, our findings suggest that PTBP1 regulates specific T cell activation responses independent of its role in proliferation and that the initial phenotype of the T cell plays an essential role in the dependency of the cell on PTBP1 for driving these changes.",

    "abstract": "The use of electronic-cigarettes (e-cigs) has increased substantially in recent years, particularly among the younger generations. Liquid nicotine is the main component of e-cigs. Previous studies have shown that mice exposed to e-cig aerosols developed lung adenocarcinoma and bladder hyperplasia. These findings implicated a potential role for e-cig aerosols and nicotine in cancer development, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we report that exposure to liquid nicotine or nicotine aerosol generated from e-cig induces downregulation of Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and polyadenylation of canonical histone mRNAs in human bronchial epithelial cells and in mice lungs. Canonical histone mRNAs typically do not end in a poly(A) tail and the acquisition of such a tail via depletion of SLBP has been shown to causes chromosome instability. We show that nicotine-induced SLBP depletion is reversed by an inhibitor of 7-nAChR (nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) or siRNA specific for 7-nAChR, indicating a nAChR-dependent reduction of SLBP by nicotine. Moreover, not only CDK1 and CK2, two kinases well known for their function for SLBP phosphorylation and degradation, but also CDK2 and PI3K/AKT pathways are shown to be involved, 7-nAChR-dependently, in nicotine-induced SLBP depletion. Importantly, nicotine-induced anchorage-independent cell growth is attenuated by inhibition of 7-nAChR and is rescued by overexpression of SLBP. We propose that the SLBP depletion and polyadenylation of canonical histone mRNAs via activation of 7-nAChR and a series of downstream signal transduction pathways, are critical for nicotine-induced cell transformation and potential carcinogenesis.",

In this research paper, identification of candidate genes involved in bioactive compounds (diosgenin) was conducted via whole transcriptome profiling of T. terrestris using the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform, which generated 482 million reads. RNA-Seq reads were assembled and clustered into 148871 unigenes. NCBI non-redundant (NR) and Swiss-Prot databases search anchored 50% unigenes with the functional annotations based on similarities of sequence. Further, in Gene Ontology and KEGG-KAAS pathways, a total of 126 unigenes were highly expressed in the terpenoids backbone biosynthesis, in which diosgenin pathways (two genes of glycolytic, three genes of mevalonate, two genes of MEP/DOX, one gene of mono-terpenoids, and seven genes of steroidal pathways) were identified. In addition, 9 genes were randomly selected for confirmation through real-time PCR. T. terrestris showed the highest homology with the Citrus sinensis and Juglans regia. 27478 unigenes of transcription factors were assembled, in which top ten transcription factors were highly expressed. A total of 17623 SSR was assembled, amongst them unigenes of di-nucleotide were highly repeated.

We used high-throughput RNA sequencing and mapping of Pho92-binding sites following UV-crosslinking to show that Pho92 is recruited to specific mRNAs in an m6A-dependent manner during the meiotic prophase, preceding their down-regulation. Strikingly, point mutations altering m6A sites in mRNAs targeted by Pho92 are sufficient to delay their down-regulation and, in one case, to impact meiotic progression. Altogether, our results indicate that Pho92 facilitate the meiotic progression by accelerating the down-regulation of timely-regulated mRNAs during meiotic recombination.",

Scientific analysis, publication, education, and outreach often benefit from photorealistic molecular depictions rendered using advanced computer-graphics programs such as Maya, 3ds Max, and Blender. However, setting up molecular scenes in these programs can be laborious even for expert users, and rendering often requires substantial time and computer resources.\n\nResultsWe have created a deep-learning model called Prot2Prot that quickly imitates photorealistic visualization styles, given a much simpler, easy-to-generate molecular representation. The resulting images are often indistinguishable from images rendered using industry-standard 3D graphics programs, but they can be created in a fraction of the time, even when running in a web browser. To the best of our knowledge, Prot2Prot is the first example of image-to-image translation applied to macromolecular visualization.\n\nAvailabilityProt2Prot is available free of charge, released under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.

    "abstract": "Yamuna river water of Agra city is heavily contaminated with toxic pollutants including heavy metal that causes severe damage to ecological and social aspects. At present, the direct use of river water for the purpose of drinking causes severe hazards due to anthropogenic activities causing environmental pollution in rivers. In present study, Yamuna River water was collected from three different sites of Agra city. Various physico-chemical parameters were estimated by following the standard methods of APHA and the concentration of heavy metals were measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). In case of physico-chemical parameters characterization, the obtained values were extremely above the permissible limits. On account of the research work; the Yamuna river water samples contains heavy metal concentrations (Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Lead and Nickel) above the desirable and admissible levels except for Zinc. During analysis of non-culturable bacteria a substantial bacterial diversity was observed in the Yamuna river water samples collected from different sites. The water samples were subjected to metagenomic analysis using Illumina platform which revealed that Proteobacteria (phylum), Betaproteobacteria (class), Burkholderiales (order), Comamonadaceae (family), Hydrogenophaga (genus) and Chloroflexi bacterium OLB 14 (species) were found as the most dominant bacterial taxonomic abundance in the river water samples. The presence of such bacterial communities in water indicates the availability of pollutants and suggests the futuristic use in the field of bioremediation.",

Here, we investigate systematically the spatial distribution and expression of mRNA at single molecule sensitivity and their corresponding proteins of 200 YFP trap protein trap lines across the intact Drosophila nervous system. 98% of the genes studied showed discordance between the distribution of mRNA and the proteins they encode in at least one region of the nervous system. These data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is very common, helping to explain the complexity of the nervous system. We also discovered that 68.5% of these genes have transcripts present at the periphery of neurons, with 9.5% at the glial periphery. Peripheral transcripts include many potential new regulators of neurons, glia and their interactions. Our approach is applicable to most genes and tissues and includes powerful novel data annotation and visualisation tools for post-transcriptional regulation.\n\nBrief outlineA novel high resolution and sensitive approach to systematically co-visualise the distribution of mRNAs and proteins in the intact nervous system reveals that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is very common.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the prevalent cause of mortality worldwide and account for the most common noncommunicable disease. CVDs describe a wide spectrum of disorders affecting the proper function, physiology and morphogenesis of the heart and blood vessels. The risk of developing cardiovascular diseases is modulated by a combination of environmental and genetic effectors. Thus, its highly important to identify candidate genes and elucidate their role in the manifestation of the disease. Large-scale human studies have revealed the implication of Craniofacial Development Protein 1 (CFDP1) in coronary artery disease (CAD). CFDP1 belongs to the evolutionary conserved Bucentaur (BCNT) family and up to date, its function and mechanism of action in Cardiovascular Development is still unclear. In this study, we utilize zebrafish to investigate the role of cfdp1 in the developing heart due to the high genomic homology, similarity in heart physiology and the ease of experimentally manipulation. We showed that cfdp1 is expressed during development and at 120 hours post fertilization its expression is restricted to the region of the heart and the head. We then generated a cfdp1-null zebrafish line using CRISPR-Cas9 system which led to a lethal phenotype since knockout embryos do not reach adulthood. cfdp1-/- embryos develop arrhythmic hearts and defective cardiac performance exhibiting statistically significant differences in heart features including End Diastolic Volume, Cardiac Output, Ejection Fraction and Stroke Volume. Myocardial trabeculation is also impaired in cfdp1-/- embryonic hearts, implying its regulatory role also in this developmental process. Findings from both knockdown and knockout experiments showed that abrogation of cfdp1 leads to downregulation of Wnt signaling in embryonic hearts during valve development but without affecting Notch activation in this process.",

    "abstract": "Information on common markers of metabolic resistance in malaria vectors from countries sharing similar eco-climatic characteristics can facilitate coordination of malaria control. Here, we characterized populations of the major malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii from Sahel region, spanning four sub-Saharan African countries: Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis identified major genes previously implicated in pyrethroid and/or cross resistance to other insecticides, overexpressed across the Sahel, including CYP450s, glutathione S-transferases, carboxylesterases, and cuticular proteins. Several, well-known markers of insecticide resistance were found in high frequencies - including in the voltage-gated sodium channel (V402L, I940T, L995F, I1527T and N1570Y), the acetylcholinesterase-1 gene (G280S) and the CYP4J5-L43F (fixed). High frequencies of the epidemiologically important chromosomal inversions, 2La, 2Rb and 2Rc were observed ([~]80% for 2Rb and 2Rc). The 2La alternative arrangement is fixed across the Sahel. Low frequencies of these inversions (<10%) were observed in the fully insecticide susceptible laboratory colony of An. coluzzii (Ngoussou). Several of the most commonly overexpressed metabolic resistance genes sit in these three inversions. Two commonly overexpressed genes, GSTe2 and CYP6Z2 were functionally validated. Transgenic Drosophila melanogaster expressing GSTe2 exhibited extremely high DDT and permethrin resistance (mortalities < 10% in 24 h). Serial deletion of the 5 intergenic region, to identify putative nucleotide(s) associated with GSTe2 overexpression, revealed that simultaneous insertion of adenine nucleotide and a transition (T->C), between Fork-head box L1 and c-EST putative binding sites were responsible for the high overexpression of GSTe2 in the resistant mosquitoes. Transgenic flies expressing CYP6Z2 exhibited marginal resistance towards 3-phenoxybenzylalcohol (a primary product of pyrethroid hydrolysis by carboxylesterases) and a type II pyrethroid, -cypermethrin. However, significantly higher mortalities were observed in CYP6Z2 transgenic flies compared with controls, on exposure to the neonicotinoid, clothianidin. This suggests a possible bioactivation of clothianidin into a toxic intermediate, which if true make it an ideal insecticide against populations of An. coluzzii overexpressing this P450. These findings will facilitate regional collaborations within the Sahel region, and refine implementation strategies through re-focusing interventions, improving evidence-based, cross-border policy towards local and regional malaria pre-elimination.",

    "abstract": "Large range structural dynamics plays a critical role for the function of electron transfer proteins. This information is generally not available from crystallographic structures, while cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can provide some elements but frequently with a degraded spatial resolution. Recently, AlphaFold-based structural modelling was extended to the prediction of protein complexes. In this work, bacterial CYP102A1 from Priestia megaterium was used as a test case to evaluate the capability of AlphaFold2 to predict alternative structures critical for catalysis. CYP102A1 monooxygenase, a NADPH-supported fatty acid hydroxylase, works as a soluble homodimer, each monomer harboring two flavins (FAD and FMN) and one heme cofactors. Large conformational changes are required during catalytic cycle to allow successive electron transfers from FAD to FMN and finally heme iron. We used the recently released AlphaFold2_advanced notebook (AF2A), to predict the possible alternate conformations supporting electron transfers in CYP102A1 homodimer. Challenging AF2A-derived models with previously reported experimental data revealed an unforeseen domain connectivity of the diflavin reductase part of the enzyme. Intermolecular crossed complex constitutes a novel type of structural organization never previously described. The predicted formation within the dimer of a stable complex between the heme containing domains was challenged and found consistent with uninterpreted features of reported crystallographic structures and cryo-EM imaging. The particularly efficient CYP102A1 catalytic mechanism was revisited to the light of the new evidenced connectivity in which the FMN-binding domain of each monomer oscillates on themselves to alternatively receive and transfer electrons without needing large structural change in the dimer. Such model was found explanatory for previously contradictory reported biochemical data. Possibility to mimic CYP102A1 structural organization into bicomponent eukaryotic P450 systems was evaluated by designing and modeling in silico synthetic reductase domains built from composite sequence segments from P. megaterium and human origins. More generally, this work illustrates how the ability of AF2A to predict alternate complex structures can enlighten and explain conformational changes critical for bio-assemblies.",

We propose a more rigorous method for inter-family cross-validation that can be used to assess the performance of learning-based models. Using this method, we further demonstrate that intra-family performance is insufficient proof of generalisation despite the widespread assumption in the literature, and provide strong evidence that many existing learning-based models have not generalised inter-family.\n\nAvailabilitySource code and data is available at https://github.com/marcellszi/dl-rna.",

    "abstract": "Cupredoxins are widely occurring copper-binding proteins with a typical Greek-key beta barrel fold. They are generally described as electron carriers that rely on a T1 copper center coordinated by four ligands provided by the folded polypeptide. The discovery of novel cupredoxins demonstrates the high diversity of this family, with variations in term of copper-binding ligands, copper center geometry, redox potential, as well as biological function. AcoP is a periplasmic protein belonging to the iron respiratory chain of the acidophilic bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. AcoP presents original features: highly resistant to acidic pH, it possesses a constrained green-type copper center of high redox potential. To understand the unique properties of AcoP, we undertook structural and biophysical characterization of wild-type AcoP and of two Cu-ligand mutants (H166A and M171A). The crystallographic structure of AcoP at 1.65 [A] resolution unveils a typical cupredoxin fold with extended loops, never observed in previously characterized cupredoxins, that might be involved in the interaction of AcoP with its physiological partners. Moreover, the structure shows that the green color of AcoP cannot be attributed to nonclassical copper ligands, its green-colored copper center raising from a long Cu-S (Cys) bond, determined by both X-ray diffraction and EXAFS. The crystal structures of two AcoP mutants confirm that the active center of AcoP is highly constrained. Comparative analysis with other cupredoxins of known structures, suggests that in AcoP the second coordination sphere might be an important determinant of active center rigidity due to the presence of an extensive hydrogen bond network.",

    "abstract": "The TMEM16 family of transmembrane proteins includes Ca2+-activated phospholipid scramblases (PLS) that can also function as non-selective ion channels. Extensive structural and functional studies have established that a membrane-exposed hydrophilic groove in TMEM16 PLS can serve as a translocation pathway for lipids. However, it is still unclear how the TMEM16 PLS conduct ions. A \"protein-delimited pore\" model suggests that ions are translocated through a narrow opening of the groove region, which is not sufficiently wide to allow lipid movement, whereas a \"proteolipid pore\" model envisions ions and lipids translocating through an open conformation of the groove. We investigated the dynamic path of potassium ion (K+) translocation that occurs when an open groove state of nhTMEM16 is obtained from long atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and calculated the free energy profile of the ion movement through the groove with umbrella sampling methodology. The free energy profile identifies effects of specific interactions along the K+ permeation path. The same calculations were performed to investigate ion permeation through a groove closed to lipid permeation in the nhTMEM16 L302A mutant which exhibits a stable conformation of the groove that does not permit lipid scrambling. Our results identify structural and energy parameters that enable K+ permeation and suggest that the presence of lipids in the nhTMEM16 groove observed in the simulations during scrambling or in/out diffusion, affect the efficiency of K+ permeation to various extents.",

    "abstract": "Airway epithelial damage is a common feature in respiratory diseases such as COPD and has been suggested to drive inflammation and progression of disease. These features manifest as remodeling and destruction of lung epithelial characteristics including loss of small airways which contributes to chronic airway inflammation. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has been shown to play a role in epithelial function and dysregulation, such as in cilia disassembly, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oxidative stress responses, and has been implicated in several diseases. We thus used ACY-1083, an inhibitor with high selectivity for HDAC6, and characterized its effects on epithelial function including epithelial disruption, cytokine production, remodeling, mucociliary clearance and cell characteristics.\n\nPrimary lung epithelial air-liquid interface cultures from COPD patients were used and the impacts of TNF, TGF-{beta}, cigarette smoke and bacterial challenges on epithelial function in the presence and absence of ACY-1083 were tested. Each challenge increased the permeability of the epithelial barrier whilst ACY-1083 blocked this effect and even decreased permeability in the absence of challenge. TNF was also shown to increase production of cytokines and mucins, with ACY-1083 reducing the effect. We observed that COPD-relevant stimulations created damage to the epithelium as seen on immunohistochemistry sections and that treatment with ACY-1083 maintained an intact cell layer and preserved mucociliary function. Interestingly, there was no direct effect on ciliary beat frequency or tight junction proteins indicating other mechanisms for the protected epithelium.\n\nIn summary, ACY-1083 shows protection of the respiratory epithelium during COPD-relevant challenges which indicates a future potential to restore epithelial structure and function to halt disease progression in clinical practice.",

To separate genetic and non-genetic inheritance, mating of males and females with average motor activity was carried out in the presence males with high or low activity. Our results show that offspring of parents who mated in the presence of males with a high motor activity were significantly more active than offspring of parents that were paired in the presence of males with low activity. Anxiety level and learning ability were not inherited in this way. It is possible that the phenomenon we discovered is important for maintaining a certain level of activity of specific populations of animals. It counteracts natural selection, which should lead to a constant increase in the activity of animals.",

    "abstract": "1A huge, unprecedented demand for gelatin coupled with its implications on global sustainability has resulted in the need to discover novel proteins with gelling attributes for applications in the food industry. Currently used gelation assays require large sample volumes and thus the screening for novel gelling proteins is a formidable technical challenge. In this paper, we report the  Floating Sphere Assay which is a simple, economical, and miniaturized assay to detect minimum gelling concentration with volumes as low as 50 l. Results from the Floating Sphere Assay are consistent with currently used methods for gelation tests and accurately estimate the Minimum Gelling Concentrations (MGCs) of gelatin, {kappa}-carrageenan and gellan gum. The assay was also able to differentiate the strengths of strong and weak gellan gum gels prepared at pH 3.5 and pH 7.0 respectively. The Floating Sphere Assay can be utilized in high-throughput screens for gelling proteins and can accelerate the discovery of gelatin substitutes.\n\n2 HighlightsO_LIWe report the Floating Sphere Assay that can be used to assesses minimum gelling concentration of solutions with volumes as low as 50 l.\nC_LIO_LIObserving whether a glass sphere placed on the surface of a test solution floats or sinks is diagnostic of gel formation\nC_LIO_LIFloating Sphere Assay can distinguish a strong gel from a weak gel\nC_LIO_LIFloating Sphere Assay is a rapid and cost-effective approach to screen for novel plant-based gelatin alternatives.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Kiwi are a unique and emblematic group of birds endemic to New Zealand. Deep-time evolutionary relationships among the five extant kiwi species have been difficult to resolve, in part due to the absence of pre-Quaternary fossils to inform speciation events among them. Here, we utilise single representative nuclear genomes of all extant kiwi species (great spotted kiwi, little spotted kiwi, Okarito brown kiwi, North Island brown kiwi, and southern brown kiwi) and investigate their evolutionary histories with phylogenomic, genetic diversity, and deep-time (past million years) demographic analyses. We uncover low levels of gene-tree phylogenetic discordance across the genomes, suggesting clear distinction between species. However, we also find indications of post-divergence gene flow, concordant with recent reports of interspecific hybrids. The four species with available reference assemblies show relatively low levels of genetic diversity, which we suggest reflects a combination of older environmental as well as more recent anthropogenic influence. In addition, we uncover similarities and differences in the demographic histories of the five kiwi species over the past million years, and suggest hypotheses regarding the impact of known past environmental events, such as volcanic eruptions and glacial periods, on the evolutionary history of the group.",
