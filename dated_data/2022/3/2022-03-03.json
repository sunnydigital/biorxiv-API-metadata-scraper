    "abstract": "There are limited data on why the 2016 Zika outbreak in Miami-Dade County, Florida was confined to certain neighborhoods. In this research, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of Zika virus, are studied to examine neighborhood-level differences in their population dynamics and underlying processes. Weekly mosquito data were acquired from the Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control Division from 2016 to 2020 from 172 traps deployed around Miami-Dade County. Using Random Forest, a machine learning method, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics of Ae. aegypti in response to meteorological conditions and neighborhood-specific socio-demographic and physical characteristics, such as land-use and land-cover type and income level, were created. The study area was divided into two groups: areas affected by local transmission of Zika during the 2016 outbreak and unaffected areas. Aedes aegypti populations in areas affected by Zika were more strongly influenced by 14- and 21-day lagged weather conditions. In the unaffected areas, mosquito populations were more strongly influenced by land-use and day-of-collection weather conditions. There are neighborhood-scale differences in Ae. aegypti population dynamics. These differences in turn influence vector-borne disease diffusion in a region. These results have implications for vector control experts to lead neighborhood-specific vector control strategies and for epidemiologists to guide vector-borne disease risk preparations, especially for containing the spread of vector-borne disease in response to ongoing climate change.",

    "abstract": "The salivary glands are a crucial site of replication for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and its murine counterpart, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Studies of MCMV often involve the use of BALB/c strain mice, but most in vitro assays are carried out in the NIH 3T3 cell line, which is derived from Swiss Albino mice. This report describes a BALB/c-derived mouse salivary gland cell line immortalized using the SV40 large T antigen. Cells stained positive for PDGFR1 and negative for E-cadherin and PECAM-1, indicating mesenchymal origin. This cell line, which has been named murine salivary gland mesenchymal (mSGM), shows promise as a tool for ex vivo immunological assays due to its MHC haplotype match with the BALB/c mouse strain. In addition, plaque assays using mSGM rather than NIH 3T3 cells are significantly more sensitive for detecting low concentrations of MCMV particles. Finally, it is demonstrated that mSGM cells express all 3 BALB/c MHC class I isotypes and are susceptible to T cell-mediated ex vivo cytotoxicity assays, leading to many possible uses in immunological studies of MCMV.",

    "abstract": "Duplication of genes and their associated cis-regulatory elements, or enhancers, is a key contributor to genome evolution and biological complexity. Moreover, many paralogs, particularly tandem duplicates, are fixed for long periods of time under the control of shared enhancers. However, in most cases the mechanism by which gene expression and function diverge following duplication is not known. Here we dissect the regulation and function of the paralogous nubbin/pdm2 genes during wing development in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that these paralogs play a redundant role in the wing and that their expression relies on a single shared wing enhancer. However, the two genes differ in their ability to respond to this enhancer, with nub responding in all wing progenitor cells and pdm2 only in a small subset. This divergence is a result of a pdm2-specific silencer element at the pdm2 promoter that receives repressive input from the transcription factor Rotund. Repression through this silencer also depends on nub, allowing pdm2 to fully respond to the wing enhancer when nub expression is perturbed and functional compensation to occur. Thus, expression divergence downstream of a shared enhancer arises as a consequence of silencing the promoter of one paralog.",

    "abstract": "The function of a feedback inhibitory circuit between cerebellar Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) was defined by combining optogenetics, neuronal activity recordings both in cerebellar slices and in vivo, and computational modeling. Purkinje cells inhibit a subset of MLIs in the inner third of the molecular layer. This inhibition is non-reciprocal, short-range (less than 200 m) and is based on convergence of 1-2 Purkinje cells onto MLIs. During learning-related eyelid movements in vivo, the activity of a subset of MLIs progressively increases at the same time that Purkinje cell activity decreases, with Purkinje cells usually leading the MLIs. Computer simulations indicate that these relationships are best explained by the feedback circuit from Purkinje cells to MLIs and that this feedback circuit plays a central role in making cerebellar learning efficient.",
