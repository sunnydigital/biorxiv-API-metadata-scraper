    "abstract": "Accurate molecular mechanics force fields for small molecules are essential for predicting protein-ligand binding affinities in drug discovery and understanding the biophysics of biomolecular systems. Torsion potentials derived from quantum chemical (QC) calculations are critical for determining the conformational distributions of small molecules, but are computationally expensive and scale poorly with molecular size. To reduce computational cost and avoid the complications of distal through-space intramolecular interactions, molecules are generally fragmented into smaller entities to carry out QC torsion scans. However, torsion potentials, particularly for conjugated bonds, can be strongly affected by through-bond chemistry distal to the torsion it-self. Poor fragmentation schemes have the potential to significantly disrupt electronic properties in the region around the torsion by removing important, distal chemistries, leading to poor representation of the parent molecules chemical environment and the resulting torsion energy profile. Here we show that a rapidly computable quantity, the fractional Wiberg bond order (WBO), is a sensitive reporter on whether the chemical environment around a torsion has been disrupted. We show that the WBO can be used as a surrogate to assess the robustness of fragmentation schemes and identify conjugated bond sets. We use this concept to construct a validation set by exhaustively fragmenting a set of druglike organic molecules and examine their corresponding WBO distributions derived from accessible conformations that can be used to evaluate fragmentation schemes. To illustrate the utility of the WBO in assessing fragmentation schemes that preserve the chemical environment, we propose a new fragmentation scheme that uses rapidly-computable AM1 WBOs, which are available essentially for free as part of standard AM1-BCC partial charge assignment. This approach can simultaneously maximize the chemical equivalency of the fragment and the substructure in the larger molecule while minimizing fragment size to accelerate QC torsion potential computation for small molecules and reducing undesired through-space steric interactions.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic was a stark reminder that a barren global antiviral pipeline has grave humanitarian consequences. Pandemics could be prevented in principle by accessible, easily deployable broad-spectrum oral antivirals. Here we report the results of the COVID Moonshot, a fully open-science, crowd sourced, structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. We discovered a novel chemical series that is differentiated from current Mpro inhibitors in that it maintains a new non-covalent, non-peptidic scaffold with nanomolar potency. Our approach leveraged crowdsourcing, high-throughput structural biology, machine learning, and exascale molecular simulations and high-throughput chemistry. In the process, we generated a detailed map of the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, extensive structure-activity relationships for multiple chemotypes, and a wealth of biochemical activity data. In a first for a structure-based drug discovery campaign, all compound designs (>18,000 designs), crystallographic data (>840 ligand-bound X-ray structures), assay data (>10,000 measurements), and synthesized molecules (>2,400 compounds) for this campaign were shared rapidly and openly, creating a rich open and IP-free knowledgebase for future anti-coronavirus drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "One of the unique traits of membrane proteins is that a significant fraction of their hydrophobic amino acids is exposed to the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers rather than being embedded in the protein interior, which is often not explicitly considered in the protein structure and function predictions. Here, we propose a characteristic and predictive quantity, the membrane contact probability (MCP), to describe the likelihood of the amino acids of a given sequence being in direct contact with the acyl chains of lipid molecules. We show that MCP is complementary to solvent accessibility in characterizing the outer surface of membrane proteins, and it can be predicted for any given sequence with a machine learning-based method by utilizing a training dataset extracted from MemProtMD, a database generated from molecular dynamics simulations for the membrane proteins with a known structure. As the first of many potential applications, we demonstrate that MCP can be used to systematically improve the prediction precision of the protein contact maps and structures.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by intracerebral accumulations of extracellular amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques and intracellular tau pathology that spread in the brain. Tau lesions occur in the form of neuropil threads, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaques i.e. tau aggregates within neurites surrounding A{beta} deposits. The cascade of events linking these lesions and synaptic or memory impairments are still debated. Intracerebral infusion of human AD brain extracts in A{beta} plaque-bearing mice that do not overexpress pathological tau proteins induces tau pathologies following heterotopic seeding of mouse tau protein. There is however little information regarding the downstream events including synaptic or cognitive repercussions of tau pathology induction in these models. In the current study, human AD brain extracts (ADbe) and control-brain extracts (Ctrlbe) were infused in the hippocampus of A{beta} plaque-bearing APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Memory, synaptic density, as well as A{beta} plaque and tau aggregate loads, microgliosis, astrogliosis at the inoculation site and in connected regions (perirhinal/entorhinal cortex) were evaluated 4 and 8 months post-inoculation. ADbe inoculation induced memory deficit. It increased deposition of A{beta} plaques close to the inoculation site. Tau pathology was also induced in ADbe-inoculated mice. Neuropil threads and neurofibrillary tangles occurred next to the inoculation site and spread to connected regions notably the perirhinal/entorhinal cortex. Neuritic plaque pathology was detected in both ADbe- and Ctrlbe- inoculated animals but ADbe inoculation increased the severity close and at distance of the inoculation site. Finally, ADbe inoculation reduced synaptic density close to the inoculation site and in connected regions as the perirhinal/entorhinal cortex. Synaptic impairments were correlated with increased severity of neuritic plaques but not of other tau lesions or A{beta} lesions, which suggests that neuritic plaques are a culprit for synaptic loss. Synaptic density was also associated with microglial load.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/438654v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@791f29org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecf87corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@adb3a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ebef93_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Electrodiagnosis is routinely integrated into clinical neurophysiology practice for peripheral nerve disease diagnoses such as neuropathy, demyelinating disorders, nerve entrapment/impingement, plexopathy or radiculopathy. Measured with conventional surface electrodes, the propagation of peripheral nerve action potentials along a nerve is the result of ionic current flow which, according to Amperes Law, generates a small magnetic field that is also detected as an \"action current\" by magnetometers such as superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) Magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems. Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are an emerging class of quantum magnetic sensors with a demonstrated sensitivity at the 1 fT/{surd}Hz level, capable of cortical action current detection. But OPMs were ostensibly constrained to low bandwidth therefore precluding their use in peripheral nerve electrodiagnosis. With careful OPM bandwidth characterization, we hypothesized OPMs may also detect compound action current signatures consistent with both Sensory Nerve Action Potential (SNAP) and the Hoffmann Reflex (H-Reflex). In as much, our work confirms OPMs enabled with expanded bandwidth can detect the magnetic signature of both the SNAP and H-Reflex. Taken together, OPMs now show potential as an emerging electrodiagnostic tool.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 contains four structural proteins in its genome. These proteins aid in the assembly and budding of new virions at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Current fundamental research efforts largely focus on one of these proteins - the spike (S) protein. Since successful antiviral therapies are likely to target multiple viral components, there is considerable interest in understanding the biophysical role of its other structural proteins, in particular structural membrane proteins. Here, we have focused our efforts on the characterization of the full-length envelope (E) protein from SARS-CoV-2, combining experimental and computational approaches. Recombinant expression of the full-length E protein from SARS-CoV-2 reveals that this membrane protein is capable of independent multimerization, possibly as a tetrameric or smaller species. Fluorescence microscopy shows that the protein localizes intracellularly, and coarse-grained MD simulations indicate it causes bending of the surrounding lipid bilayer, corroborating a potential role for the E protein in viral budding. Although we did not find robust electrophysiological evidence of ion-channel activity, cells transfected with the E protein exhibited reduced intracellular Ca2+, which may further promote viral replication. However, our atomistic MD simulations revealed that previous NMR structures are relatively unstable, and result in models incapable of ion conduction. Our study highlights the importance of using high-resolution structural data obtained from a full-length protein to gain detailed molecular insights, and eventually permitting virtual drug screening.",

    "abstract": "The Solanaceae or \"nightshade\" family is an economically important group that harbors a remarkable amount of diversity. To gain a better understanding of how the unique biology of the Solanaceae relates to the familys small RNA genomic landscape, we downloaded over 255 publicly available small RNA datasets that comprise over 2.6 billion reads of sequence data. We applied a suite of computational tools to predict and annotate two major small RNA classes: (1) microRNAs (miRNAs), typically 20-22 nt RNAs generated from a hairpin precursor and functioning in gene silencing, and (2) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), including 24-nt heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs) typically functioning to repress repetitive regions of the genome via RNA-directed DNA methylation, as well as secondary phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs) and trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) generated via miRNA-directed cleavage of a Pol II-derived RNA precursor. Our analyses described thousands of small RNA loci, including poorly-understood clusters of 22-nt siRNAs that accumulate during viral infection. The birth, death, expansion, and contraction of these small RNA loci are dynamic evolutionary processes that characterize the Solanaceae family. These analyses indicate that individuals within the same genus share similar small RNA landscapes, whereas comparisons between distinct genera within the Solanaceae reveal relatively few commonalities.\n\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYWe use over 255 publicly-available small RNA datasets to characterize the small RNA landscape for the Solanaceae family.",

    "abstract": "Several vaccines have been introduced to combat the coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines include mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles or adenoviral vectors that encode the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, inactivated virus, or protein subunits. Despite growing success in worldwide vaccination efforts, additional capabilities may be needed in the future to address issues such as stability and storage requirements, need for vaccine boosters, desirability of different routes of administration, and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the Delta variant. Here, we present a novel, well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) of Salmonella typhimurium that are decorated with the mammalian cell culture-derived Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). RBD-conjugated outer membrane vesicles (RBD-OMVs) were used to immunize the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) model of COVID-19. Intranasal immunization resulted in high titers of blood anti-RBD IgG as well as detectable mucosal responses. Neutralizing antibody activity against wild-type and Delta variants was evident in all vaccinated subjects. Upon challenge with live virus, hamsters immunized with RBD-OMV, but not animals immunized with unconjugated OMVs or a vehicle control, avoided body mass loss, had lower virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and experienced less severe lung pathology. Our results emphasize the value and versatility of OMV-based vaccine approaches.",

    "abstract": "The anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria could transform ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas, and this obligate anaerobic process accounts for up to half of the global nitrogen loss in surface environments. Yet its origin and evolution, which may give important insights into the biogeochemistry of early Earth, remains enigmatic. Here, we performed comprehensive phylogenomic analysis and showed a single origin of anammox bacteria within the phylum Planctomycetes. After accommodating the uncertainties and factors influencing time estimates, which includes implementing both a traditional cyanobacteria-based and a recently developed mitochondria-based approach, we estimated that anammox bacteria originated at early Proterozoic and most likely around the so-called Great Oxidation Event (GOE; 2.32 to 2.5 billion years ago [Ga]) which fundamentally changed global biogeochemical cycles. We further showed that during the origin of anammox bacteria, genes involved in oxidative stress, bioenergetics and anammox granules formation were recruited, which might have contributed to their survival on an increasingly oxic Earth. Our findings suggest the rising levels of atmospheric oxygen, which made nitrite increasingly available, was a potential driving force for the emergence of anammox bacteria. This is one of the first studies that link the GOE to the evolution of obligate anaerobic bacteria.",

The major advantages of our approach are: 1) synthetic training data can be generated virtually instantly, and on demand; 2) these synthetic images are accompanied by perfect ground truth positions of cells, meaning no data curation is required; 3) different biological conditions, imaging platforms, and imaging modalities can be rapidly simulated, meaning any change in ones experimental setup no longer requires the laborious process of manually generating new training data for each change. Our benchmarking results demonstrate that models trained on SyMBac data generate more accurate and precise cell masks than those trained on human annotated data, because the model learns the true position of the cell irrespective of imaging artefacts. Machine-learning models trained with SyMBac data are capable of analysing data from various imaging platforms and are robust to drastic changes in cell size and morphology.",

    "abstract": "Despite the beneficial effects of xenotopically expressing the mitochondrial alternative oxidase AOX from Ciona intestinalis in mammalian and insect models, important detrimental outcomes have also been reported, raising concerns regarding its potential deployment as a therapeutic enzyme for human mitochondrial diseases. Because of its non-protonmotive terminal oxidase activity, AOX can bypass the cytochrome segment of the respiratory chain whilst not contributing to mitochondrial ATP synthesis. We have previously shown that pupal lethality occurs when AOX-expressing Drosophila larvae are cultured on a low-nutrient diet, indicating that AOX can perturb normal metabolism during development. Here, combined omics analyses revealed multiple correlates of this diet-dependent lethality, including a general alteration of larval amino acid and lipid metabolism, functional and morphological changes to the larval digestive tract, and a drastic decrease in larval biomass accumulation. Pupae at the pre-lethality stage presented a general downregulation of mitochondrial metabolism and a signature of starvation and deregulated signaling. AOX-induced lethality was partially rescued when the low-nutrient diet was supplemented with tryptophan and/or methionine, but not with proline and/or glutamate, strongly suggesting perturbation of one-carbon metabolism. The developmental dependence on tryptophan and/or methionine, associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, 2-hydroxyglutarate, choline-containing metabolites and breakdown products of membrane phospholipids, indicates that AOX expression promotes tissue proliferation and larval growth, but this is ultimately limited by energy dissipation due to partial mitochondrial uncoupling. We speculate that the combination of dietary interventions and AOX expression might, nevertheless, be useful for the metabolic regulation of proliferative tissues, such as tumors.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes have evolved repeatedly across the tree of life. As they are present in different copy numbers in males and females, they are expected to experience different selection pressures than the autosomes, with consequences including a faster rate of evolution, increased accumulation of sexually antagonistic alleles, and the evolution of dosage compensation. Whether these consequences are general or linked to idiosyncrasies of specific taxa is not clear as relatively few taxa have been studied thus far. Here we use wholegenome sequencing to identify and characterize the evolution of the X chromosome in five species of Timema stick insects with XX:X0 sex determination. The X chromosome had a similar size (approximately 11% of the genome) and gene content across all five species, suggesting that the X chromosome originated prior to the diversification of the genus. Genes on the X showed evidence of relaxed selection (elevated dN/dS) and a slower evolutionary rate (dN + dS) than genes on the autosomes, likely due to sex-biased mutation rates. Genes on the X also showed almost complete dosage compensation in somatic tissues (heads and legs), but dosage compensation was absent in the reproductive tracts. Contrary to prediction, sex-biased genes showed little enrichment on the X, suggesting that the advantage X-linkage provides to the accumulation of sexually antagonistic alleles is weak. Overall, we found the consequences of X-linkage on gene sequences and expression to be similar across Timema species, showing the characteristics of the X chromosome are surprisingly consistent over 30 million years of evolution.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that intramolecular epistasis is a major determinant of rates and patterns of protein evolution and imposes a substantial constraint on the evolution of novel protein functions. Here, we examine the role of intramolecular epistasis in the recurrent evolution of resistance to cardiotonic steroids (CTS) across tetrapods, which occurs via specific amino acid substitutions to the -subunit family of Na,K-ATPases (ATP1A). After identifying a series of recurrent substitutions at two key sites of ATP1A that are predicted to confer CTS resistance in diverse tetrapods, we then performed protein engineering experiments to test the functional consequences of introducing these substitutions onto divergent species backgrounds. In line with previous results, we find that substitutions at these sites can have substantial background-dependent effects on CTS resistance. Globally, however, these substitutions also have pleiotropic effects that are consistent with additive rather than background-dependent effects. Moreover, the magnitude of a substitutions effect on activity does not depend on the overall extent of ATP1A sequence divergence between species. Our results suggest that epistatic constraints on the evolution of CTS-resistant forms of Na,K-ATPase likely depend on a small number of sites, with little dependence on overall levels of protein divergence. We propose that dependence on a limited number sites may account for the observation of convergent CTS resistance substitutions observed among taxa with highly divergent Na,K-ATPases.\n\nSignificance StatementIndividual amino acid residues within a protein work in concert to produce a functionally coherent structure that must be maintained even as orthologous proteins in different species diverge over time. Given this dependence, we expect identical mutations to have more similar effects on protein function in more closely related species. We tested this hypothesis by performing protein-engineering experiments on ATP1A, an enzyme mediating target-site insensitivity to cardiotonic steroids (CTS) in diverse animals. These experiments reveal that the phenotypic effects of substitutions can sometimes be background-dependent, but also that the magnitude of these phenotypic effects does not correlate with overall levels of ATP1A sequence divergence. Our results suggest that epistatic constraints are determined by states at a small number of sites, potentially explaining the frequent convergent CTS resistance substitutions among Na,K-ATPases of highly divergent taxa.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, multiple studies have shown that cells maintain a balance of mRNA production and degradation, but the mechanisms by which cells implement this balance remain unknown. Here, we monitored cells mRNA and nascent mRNA profiles immediately following an acute depletion of Xrn1 - the main 5-3 mRNA exonuclease - that was previously implicated in balancing mRNA levels. We captured the detailed dynamics of the cells adaptation to rapid degradation of Xrn1 and observed a significant accumulation of mRNA, followed by a delayed global reduction in nascent transcription and a gradual return to baseline mRNA levels. We present evidence that this transcriptional response is linked to cell cycle progression, and that it is not unique to Xrn1 depletion; rather, it is induced earlier when upstream factors in the 5-3 degradation pathway are perturbed. Our data suggest that the RNA feedback mechanism is cell-cycle-linked and monitors the accumulation of inputs to the 5-3 exonucleolytic pathway rather than its outputs.",

But strategies to analyse protein interactions on a diffusible membrane surface combined with the practical ease of pull-downs remain unavailable. Such strategies are important to analyse protein complexes that mature in composition and stability because of diffusion-based encounter between participant proteins. Here, we describe a generic pull-down strategy to analyse such complexes using chelating lipid-containing supported bilayers formed on silica beads. These templates can display desired His-tagged bait proteins on a diffusible membrane surface. Using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a paradigm, we find that the clathrin-binding adaptor protein epsin1 displayed as bait on these templates pulls down significantly higher amounts of clathrin from brain lysates than when immobilized on conventional matrices. Together, our results establish the potential of such templates as superior matrices for analysing protein-protein interactions and resultant complexes formed on membrane surfaces.",

An iterative procedure was developed in which AlphaFold models are automatically rebuilt based on experimental density maps and the rebuilt models are used as templates in new AlphaFold predictions.

    "abstract": "Predictable trait variation across environmental gradients suggests that adaptive evolution repeatedly finds the same solution to a challenge. Trait-environment associations can reflect long-term, genetic evolution across phylogenies, or short-term, plastic responses of individuals. When phylogenetic and population-level patterns match, it implies consistency between the long timescale of adaptation and the short timescale of acclimatization. Alternatively, genetic adaptation can find solutions that  break the rules of trait-environment covariation. For example, blood-hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) increases at high elevations in animals, but genetic adaptations in some populations have been shown to augment tissue oxygenation while curtailing hemoglobin production, altering this predictable [Hb]-elevation association. Here, we tested whether species adaptation to elevation generally alters trait-environment relationships for blood. To do this, we measured blood traits of 1,217 individuals representing 77 species of Andean hummingbirds, across a 4,600 m elevational gradient. We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to estimate blood trait responses to elevation, environmental temperature, precipitation, individual and species characteristics, and phylogeny. Strikingly, the effects of elevation on [Hb] and hematocrit (Hct) were nearly identical for individuals and species, implying that rules of elevational blood variation are set by physics of gas exchange in the hummingbird respiratory system and are unchanged by species adaptation. However, when we looked at mechanisms of [Hb] adjustment--by changes in red blood cell size or number--we did find a signal of species adaptation: To adjust [Hb], species at low and high elevations, respectively, tended to adjust cell size, whereas species at mid-elevations tended to adjust cell number. Despite scale-independent elevational variation in [Hb] and Hct, the species-specific balance of red blood cell size versus number appears to have been affected by adaptations that distinguish hummingbird species living at moderate versus high elevations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWithdrawal of problematic scientific articles after publication is one of the mechanisms for correcting the literature available to publishers, especially in the conditions of the ever-increasing trend of publishing activity in the medical field. The market volume and the business model justify publishers involvement in the post-publication quality control(QC) of scientific production. The limited information about this subject determined us to analyze retractions and the main retraction reasons for publishers with many withdrawn articles. We also propose a score to measure the evolution of their performance. The data set used for this article consists of 4844 PubMed retracted papers published between 1.01.2009 and 31.12.2020.\n\nMethodsWe have analyzed the retraction notes and retraction reasons, grouping them by publisher. To evaluate performance, we formulated an SDTP score whose calculation formula includes several parameters: speed (article exposure time(ET)), detection rate (percentage of articles whose retraction is initiated by the editor/publisher/institution without the authors participation), transparency (percentage of retracted articles available online and clarity of retraction notes), precision (mention of authors responsibility and percentage of retractions for reasons other than editorial errors).\n\nResultsThe 4844 withdrawn articles were published in 1767 journals by 366 publishers, the average number of withdrawn articles/journal being 2.74. Forty-five publishers have more than ten withdrawn articles, holding 88% of all papers and 79% of journals. Combining our data with data from another study shows that less than 7% of PubMed journals withdrew at least one article. Only 10.5% of the withdrawal notes included the individual responsibility of the authors. Nine of the top 11 publishers had the largest number of articles withdrawn in 2020, in the first 11 places finding, as expected, some big publishers. Retraction reasons analysis shows considerable differences between publishers concerning the articles ET: median values between 9 and 43 months (mistakes), 9 and 73 months (images), 10 and 42 months (plagiarism & overlap).\n\nThe SDTP score shows, between 2018 and 2020, an improvement in QC of four publishers in the top 11 and a decrease in the gap between 1st and 11th place. The group of the other 355 publishers also has a positive evolution of the SDTP score.\n\nConclusionsPublishers have to get involved actively and measurably in the post-publication evaluation of scientific products. The introduction of reporting standards for retraction notes and replicable indicators for quantifying publishing QC can help increase the overall quality of scientific literature.",

    "abstract": "With the continual evolution of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that are more virulent, transmissible, and able to evade current vaccines, there is an urgent need for effective anti-viral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a leading target for drug design due to its conserved and indispensable role in the viral life cycle. Drugs targeting Mpro appear promising but will elicit selection pressure for resistance. To understand resistance potential in Mpro, we performed a comprehensive mutational scan of the protease that analyzed the function of all possible single amino acid changes. We developed three separate high-throughput assays of Mpro function in yeast, based on either the ability of Mpro variants to cleave at a defined cut-site or on the toxicity of their expression to yeast. We used deep sequencing to quantify the functional effects of each variant in each screen. The protein fitness landscapes from all three screens were strongly correlated, indicating that they captured the biophysical properties critical to Mpro function. The fitness landscapes revealed a non-active site location on the surface that is extremely sensitive to mutation making it a favorable location to target with inhibitors. In addition, we found a network of critical amino acids that physically bridge the two active sites of the Mpro dimer. The clinical variants of Mpro were predominantly functional in our screens, indicating that Mpro is under strong selection pressure in the human population. Our results provide predictions of mutations that will be readily accessible to Mpro evolution and that are likely to contribute to drug resistance. This complete mutational guide of Mpro can be used in the design of inhibitors with reduced potential of evolving viral resistance.",

While the core mechanisms of photosynthesis are highly conserved, certainly in higher plants, plants that can maintain a high photosynthetic light-use efficiency at high irradiance are exceptional and may be useful to understand and improve high irradiance photosynthesis of crops. One such exceptional species is Hirschfeldia incana, a member of the well-studied Brassicaceae family that is easy to grow under standard laboratory conditions, providing an excellent resource for studying the genetic and physiological basis of this trait. Here, we present a reference assembly of H. incana and affirm its high photosynthetic efficiency relative to the Brassicaceae species Brassica rapa, Brassica nigra, and Arabidopsis thaliana. We estimate that it diverged from B. rapa and B. nigra 10-11 million years ago and that its genome has diversified from that of the latter two species through large chromosomal rearrangements, species-specific transposon activity, and differential retention of duplicated genes. Genes present at copy numbers different from B. rapa and B. nigra include those involved in photosynthesis and/or abiotic stress, which may mediate the high photosynthetic efficiency of H. incana. We expect the reference assembly of H. incana to be a valuable genomic resource for identifying ways to enhance photosynthetic rates in crop species.",

To this end, we studied how monkeys switched between three rules. Each rule was compositional, requiring the animal to discriminate one of two features of a stimulus and then respond with an associated eye movement along one of two different response axes. By modeling behavior we found the animals learned the axis of response using fast inference (rule switching) while continuously re-estimating the stimulus-response associations within an axis (rule learning).

However, transcript assembly efforts have produced a surprisingly large variation in the number of transcripts, and especially so for noncoding transcripts. The heterogeneity of the assembled transcript sets might be partially explained by sequencing depth.\n\nResultsHere, we used real and simulated short-read sequencing data as well as long-read data to systematically investigate the impact of sequencing depths on the accuracy of assembled transcripts. We assembled and analyzed transcripts from 671 human short-read data sets and four long-read data sets. At the first level, there is a positive correlation between the number of reads and the number of recovered transcripts. However, the effect of the sequencing depth varied based on cell or tissue type, the type of read considered and the nature and expression levels of the transcripts. The detection of coding transcripts saturated rapidly for both short-read and long-reads, however, there was no sign of saturation for noncoding transcripts at any sequencing depth. Increasing long-read sequencing depth specifically benefited transcripts containing transposable elements. Finally, we show how single-cell RNA-seq can be guided by transcripts assembled from bulk long-read samples, and demonstrate that noncoding transcripts are expressed at similar levels to coding transcripts but are expressed in fewer cells.\n\nConclusionsThis study shows the impact of sequencing depth on transcript assembly. Sequencing read depth has a relatively minor impact on coding transcript assembly, but a major effect on the assembly of noncoding transcripts. This study highlights important factors to consider when deciding the sequencing read depths to be used for transcript assembly.",

    "abstract": "Macroporous hydrogels facilitate solute transport and cell-cell communication in 3D, but materials allowing for in situ pore formation and 3D-printing in aqueous solutions are scarce. Here, a phase-separating thiol-ene photoresin is developed for light-assisted 3D-printing of hierarchical macroporous hydrogels that support 3D cell growth. The resin consists of norbornene-functionalized polyvinyl alcohol, di-thiol crosslinker and dextran sulfate, which can rapidly form a hydrogel with interconnected pores by photopolymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS). The pore size is tunable in the range of 2-40 m as quantified by fast Fourier transformation of confocal imaging data and depends on light intensity, polymer composition and molecular charge. After 3D photoencapsulation, high cell viability (>90%) is achieved and cell spreading in the macroporous hydrogels is significantly higher than in conventional nanoporous hydrogels. The incorporation of a thermo-reversible gelatin network enables its printability for tomographic volumetric bioprinting in the presence of human mesenchymal stem cells. A cm-scale cell-laden hydrogel construct with vasculature-like channels and interconnected pores can be 3D-printed in 12 seconds. The materials are cell-compatible, low-cost, easy-to-make and highly efficient for PIPS and light-based 3D-printing, which is unachievable with conventional 3D-printable hydrogels. Such materials are promising for future photofabrication of complex tissues with a hierarchical porosity within seconds.",

It relies on specialized cells, the sieve elements, which are enucleated and interconnected through large so-called sieve pores in their adjoining cell walls. Reverse genetics identified PECTATE LYASE LIKE 12 (PLL12) as critical for plant growth and development. Using genetic complementation, we establish that PLL12 enzyme activity is required exclusively late during cell differentiation. Physiological assays suggested a role specifically in phloem long distance transport while short distance symplastic transport does not require PLL12. Exploiting CALLOSE SYNTHASE 7 (CALS7) as a polar fluorescent marker, we identified structural defects in sieve pores in pll12. Due to the serial arrangement of sieve elements in the phloem, such defects should affect a plants ability specifically for symplastic transport over long distances.",

    "abstract": "Axon degeneration contributes to the disruption of neuronal circuit function in diseased and injured nervous systems. Severed axons degenerate following the activation of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, which culminates in the activation of SARM1 in mammals to execute the pathological depletion of the metabolite NAD+. SARM1 NADase activity is activated by the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In mammals, keeping NMN levels low potently preserves axons after injury, however, it remains unclear whether NMN is also a key mediator of axon degeneration, and dSarm activation, in flies. Here, we demonstrate that lowering NMN levels in Drosophila through the expression of a newly generated prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase (NMN-D) preserves severed axons for months and keeps them circuit-integrated for weeks. NMN-D alters the NAD+ metabolic flux by lowering NMN, while NAD+ remains unchanged in vivo. Increased NMN synthesis, by the expression of mouse nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (mNAMPT), leads to faster axon degeneration after injury. We also show that NMN-induced activation of dSarm mediates axon degeneration in vivo. Finally, NMN-D delays neurodegeneration caused by loss of the sole NMN-consuming and NAD+-synthesizing enzyme dNmnat. Our results reveal a critical role for NMN in neurodegeneration in the fly, which extends beyond axonal injury. The potent neuroprotection by reducing NMN levels is similar or even stronger than the interference with other essential mediators of axon degeneration in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCRISPR-Cas9-generated zebrafish carrying a 12 base-pair deletion in stxbpb1b, a paralog sharing 79% amino acid sequence identity with human, exhibit spontaneous electrographic seizures during larval stages of development. Zebrafish stxbp1b mutants provide an efficient preclinical platform to test antiseizure therapeutics. The present study was designed to test prototype antiepileptic drugs approved for clinical use and two recently identified repurposed drugs with antiseizure activity.\n\nMethodsLarval homozygous stxbp1b zebrafish (4 days post-fertilization) were agarose-embedded and monitored for electrographic seizure activity using a local field recording electrode placed in midbrain. Frequency of ictal-like events was evaluated at baseline and following 45 min of continuous drug exposure (1 mM, bath application). Analysis was performed on coded files by an experimenter blinded to drug treatment and genotype.\n\nResultsPhenytoin, valproate, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, and diazepam had no effect on ictal-like event frequency in stxbp1b mutant zebrafish. Clemizole and trazodone decreased ictal-like event frequency in stxbp1b mutant zebrafish by 80% and 83%, respectively. These results suggest that repurposed drugs with serotonin receptor binding affinities could be effective antiseizure treatments.\n\nSignificanceClemizole and trazodone were identified in a larval zebrafish model for Dravet syndrome. Based primarily on these preclinical zebrafish studies, compassionate-use and double-blind clinical trials with both drugs have progressed. The present study extends this approach to a preclinical zebrafish model representing STXBP1-related disorders, and suggests that future clinical studies may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment with the advent of advanced cell engineering techniques aimed at targeted therapy with reduced systemic toxicity. However, understanding the underlying immune-cancer interactions require development of advanced three-dimensional (3D) models of human tissues. In this study, we developed proof-of-concept 3D tumor models with increasing complexity to study the cytotoxic responses of CD8+ T cells, genetically engineered to express mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell receptors, towards MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Homotypic MDA-MB-231 and heterotypic MDA-MB-231/human dermal fibroblast (HDF) tumor spheroids were primed with precursor MAIT cell ligand 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-ARU). Engineered T cells effectively eliminated tumors after a 3-day culture period, demonstrating that the engineered TCR recognized MR1 expressing tumor cells in the presence of 5-ARU. Tumor cell killing efficiency of engineered T cells were also assessed by encapsulating these cells in fibrin, mimicking a tumor extracellular matrix microenvironment. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN{gamma}, IL-13, CCL-3 indicated immune cell activation in all tumor models, post immunotherapy. Further, in corroborating the cytotoxic activity, we found that granzymes A and B were also upregulated, in homotypic as well as heterotypic tumors. Finally, a 3D bioprinted tumor model was employed to study the effect of localization of T cells with respect to tumors. T cells bioprinted proximal to the tumor had reduced invasion index and increased cytokine secretion, which indicated a paracrine mode of immune-cancer interaction. Development of 3D tumor-T cell platforms may enable studying the complex immune-cancer interactions and engineering MAIT cells for cell-based cancer immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Necrosis of macrophages in the tuberculous granuloma represents a major pathogenic event in tuberculosis. Through a zebrafish forward genetic screen, we identified the mTOR kinase, a master regulator of metabolism, as an early host resistance factor in tuberculosis. We found that mTOR complex 1 protects macrophages from mycobacterium-induced death by enabling infection-induced increases in mitochondrial energy metabolism fueled by glycolysis. These metabolic adaptations are required to prevent mitochondrial damage and death caused by the secreted mycobacterial virulence determinant ESAT-6. Thus, the host can effectively counter this early critical mycobacterial virulence mechanism simply by regulating energy metabolism, thereby allowing pathogen-specific immune mechanisms time to develop. Our findings may explain why Mycobacterium tuberculosis, albeit humanitys most lethal pathogen, is successful in only a minority of infected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes chicken pox and shingles and is prevalent worldwide. Acyclovir and penciclovir (and its prodrugs) are first-line treatments for VZV infections, but they are not highly potent against VZV and resistance may arise in immunocompromised people on long-term therapy. HPMPC (cidofovir) is active against VZV, but cidofovir is not approved for treating VZV diseases, is nephrotoxic, and is not orally bioavailable. Here, we present the synthesis and evaluation of USC-373, a phosphonate prodrug of HPMPC with activity against VZV and other DNA viruses. In cultured fibroblasts, it was potent against VZV Ellen laboratory strain and was not overtly toxic, with EC50 of 4 nM and CC50 of 0.20 M, producing a selectivity index of 50. In ARPE-19 cells, USC-373 was effective against VZV-ORF57-Luc wild type strain and the acyclovir-resistant isogenic strain. In human skin organ culture, USC-373 formulated in cocoa butter and applied topically prevented VZV-ORF57-Luc spread without toxicity. In NuSkin mice with human skin xenografts, one daily dose of 3 mg/kg was effective by the subcutaneous route, and one daily dose of 10 mg/kg was effective by the oral route. Remarkably, a 10 mg/kg oral dose given every other day was also effective. USC-373 was well tolerated and mice did not lose weight or show signs of distress. The prodrug modifications of USC-373 increase the potency and oral bioavailability compared to its parent nucleoside analog, HPMPC.",

    "abstract": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a tick-borne bandavirus mainly transmitted by Haemaphysalis longicornis in East Asia, mostly in rural areas. To date, the amplifying host involved in the natural transmission of SFTSV remains unidentified. Our epidemiological field survey conducted in endemic areas in China showed that hedgehogs were widely distributed, had heavy tick infestations, and had high SFTSV seroprevalence and RNA prevalence. After experimental infection of Erinaceus amurensis and Atelerix albiventris hedgehogs with SFTSV, robust but transitory viremias were detected, which lasted for around nine to eleven days. The infected hedgehogs experienced light weight loss and histopathology of the spleen showed hemorrhagic necrosis and lymphopenia, with infected hedgehogs recovering after viral clearance. Remarkably, SFTSV transmission cycle between hedgehogs and nymph/adult H. longicornis was easily accomplished under laboratory condition with 100% efficiency. Furthermore, naive H. longicornis ticks could be infected by SFTSV-positive ticks co-feeding on naive hedgehogs, with transstadial transmission of SFTSV also confirmed. We also found that SFTSV viremia remained high in hedgehogs during hibernation, suggesting that this mechanism might contribute to the persistence of SFTSV from one year to the next. Of concern, we recently found evidence of the natural circulation of SFTSV in the urban area of Beijing City in China involving H. longicornis ticks and E. amurensis hedgehogs. Our study suggests that the hedgehogs are the major wildlife amplifying hosts of SFTSV and that urban outbreaks of SFTSV might occur in the future.",

    "abstract": "The environment is an important component in the emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Despite that, little effort has been made to monitor AMR outside of clinical and veterinary settings. Partially, this is caused by a lack of comprehensive reference data for the vast majority of environments. To enable monitoring to detect deviations from the normal background resistance levels in the environment, it is necessary to establish a baseline of AMR in a variety of settings. In an attempt to establish this baseline level, we here performed a comprehensive literature survey, identifying 150 scientific papers containing relevant qPCR data on antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in environments associated with potential routes for AMR dissemination. The collected data included 1594 samples distributed across 30 different countries and 12 sample types, in a time span from 2001 to 2020. We found that for most ARGs, the typically reported abundances in human impacted environments fell in an interval from 10-5 to 10-3 copies per 16S rRNA, roughly corresponding to one ARG copy in a thousand bacteria. Altogether these data represent a comprehensive overview of the occurrence and levels of ARGs in different environments, providing background data for risk assessment models within current and future AMR monitoring frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Male MS-NASH mice were maintained on a high-fat diet for 16 weeks with and without red algae-derived minerals. Obeticholic acid (OCA) was used as a comparator in the same strain and diet. C57BL/6 mice maintained on a standard (low-fat) rodent chow diet were used as a control. At the end of the in-life portion of the study, body weight, liver weight, liver enzyme levels and liver histology were assessed. Samples obtained from individual livers were subjected to Tandem Mass Tag labeling / mass spectroscopy for protein profile determination. As compared to mice maintained on the low-fat diet, all high-fat-fed mice had increased whole body and liver weight, increased liver enzyme (aminotransferases) levels and widespread steatosis / ballooning hepatocyte degeneration. Histological evidence for liver inflammation and collagen deposition was also present, but changes were to a lesser extent. A moderate reduction in ballooning degeneration and collagen deposition was observed with mineral supplementation. Control mice on the high-fat diet alone demonstrated multiple protein changes associated with dysregulated fat and carbohydrate metabolism, lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Cholesterol metabolism and bile acid formation were especially sensitive to diet. In mice receiving multi-mineral supplementation along with the high-fat diet, there was reduced liver toxicity as evidenced by a decrease in levels of several cytochrome P450 enzymes and other oxidantgenerating moieties. Additionally, elevated expression of several keratins was also detected in mineral-supplemented mice. The protein changes observed with mineral supplementation were not seen with OCA. Our previous studies have shown that mice maintained on a high-fat diet for up to 18 months develop end-stage liver injury including hepatocellular carcinoma. Mineral-supplemented mice were substantially protected against tumor formation and other end-state consequences of high-fat feeding. The present study identifies early (16-week) protein changes occurring in the livers of the high-fat diet-fed mice, and how the expression of these proteins is influenced by mineral supplementation. These findings help elucidate early protein changes that contribute to end-stage liver injury and potential mechanisms by which dietary minerals may mitigate such damage.",

The main cause of morbidity and mortality in MFS is thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection, but the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. We found a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in ascending aorta of MFS patients and MFS mice harboring the Fbn1 mutation (C1039G), which was associated with up-regulation of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) protein in aortic endothelial cells (ECs). Mechanosensitive signaling involving focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and early growth response-1 (Egr- 1) was aberrantly activated in ascending aorta of Fbn1C1039G/+ mice, and mechanical stress on human aortic ECs up-regulated XOR expression through FAK-p38 MAPK activation and Egr-1 up-regulation. Inhibition of XOR function by ECs-specific disruption of Xdh gene or by systemic administration of XOR inhibitor febuxostat in Fbn1C1039G/+ mice suppressed ROS generation, FAK-p38 MAPK activation, and Egr-1 up-regulation, leading to attenuation of aortic aneurysm formation. These findings unveil aberrant mechanosensitive signaling in vascular ECs triggering endothelial XOR activation and ROS generation as a culprit underlying the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm formation in MFS, and highlight a drug repositioning approach using a uric acid lowering drug febuxostat as a potential therapy for MFS.",

    "abstract": "As important as the fasting response is for survival, an inability to shut it down once nutrients become available can lead to exacerbated disease and severe wasting. The liver is central to transitions between feeding and fasting states, with glucagon being a key initiator of the hepatic fasting response. However, the precise mechanisms controlling fasting are not well defined. One potential mediator of these transitions is Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) given its role in nutrient sensing. Here, we show LKB1 knockout mice have a severe wasting and prolonged fasting phenotype despite increased food intake. By applying RNA sequencing and intravital microscopy we show that loss of LKB1 leads to a dramatic reprogramming of the hepatic lobule through robust upregulation of periportal genes and functions. This is likely mediated through the opposing effect LKB1 has on glucagon pathways and gene expression. Conclusion: our findings show that LKB1 acts as a brake to the glucagon-mediated fasting response resulting in \"periportalization\" of the hepatic lobule and whole-body metabolic inefficiency. These findings reveal a new mechanism by which hepatic metabolic compartmentalization is regulated by nutrient-sensing.",

    "abstract": "Using conventional statistical approaches there exist powerful methods to classify shapes. Embedded in morphospaces is information that allows us to visualize theoretical leaves. These unmeasured leaves are never considered nor how the negative morphospace can inform us about the forces responsible for shaping leaf morphology. Here, we model leaf shape using an allometric indicator of leaf size, the ratio of vein to blade areas. The borders of the observable morphospace are restricted by constraints and define an orthogonal grid of developmental and evolutionary effects which can predict the shapes of possible grapevine leaves. Leaves in the genus Vitis are found to fully occupy morphospace available to them. From this morphospace we predict the developmental and evolutionary shapes of grapevine leaves that are not only possible, but exist, and argue that rather than explaining leaf shape in terms of discrete nodes or species, that a continuous model is more appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) kinetics in urokinase-type plasminogen activator/severe combined immunodeficient (uPA-SCID) mice reconstituted with humanized livers from inoculation to steady state is highly dynamic despite the absence of an adaptive immune response. We developed a stochastic agent-based model that includes virion production cycles in individual infected human hepatocytes. The model was calibrated using a genetic algorithm approach with the serum HBV kinetics observed in mice inoculated with 108 HBV genome equivalents and fit the data well when the following viral production parameters were assumed: (1) An eclipse phase lasting 5-50 hours and (2) a post-eclipse phase production rate that is based on increasing production cycles initially starting with a long production cycle of 1 virion per 20 hours that gradually reaches 1 virion per hour after approximately 3-4 days before virion production increases dramatically to reach to a steady state production rate of 4 virions per hour per cell. The model was then validated by showing it could accurately simulate the viral kinetics observed with lower HBV inoculation doses (104-107 genome equivalents) in which similar, but delayed patterns were observed. Together, modeling suggests that it is the cyclic nature of the virus lifecycle combined with an initial slow but increasing rate of HBV production from each cell that plays a role in generating the observed multiphasic HBV kinetic patterns in humanized mice.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside on the luminal surface of the airways and alveoli, ensuring proper gas exchange by ingesting cellular debris and pathogens, and regulating inflammatory responses. Therefore, understanding the heterogeneity and diverse roles played by AMs, interstitial macrophages (IMs), and recruited monocytes is critical for treating airway diseases. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 113,213 bronchoalveolar lavage cells from four healthy and three uninflamed cystic fibrosis subjects and identified FOLR2+SELENOP+ and SPP1+PLA2G7+ IMs, monocyte subtypes, and dendritic cell 1 (DC1), DC2, migDCs, plasmacytoid DCs, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and four AM superclusters (families) based on the expression of IFI27 and APOC2 genes. These 4 AM families have at least eight distinct functional members (subclusters) named after their differentially expressed gene(s): IGF1, CCL18, CXCL5, Cholesterol, Chemokine, Metallothionein, Interferon and small-cluster AMs. Interestingly, the Chemokine cluster further divides with each subcluster selectively expressing a unique combination of chemokines. One of the most striking observations, besides the heterogeneity, is the conservation of AM family members in relatively equal ratio across all AM superclusters and individuals. Transcriptional data and TotalSeq technology were used to investigate cell surface markers that distinguish resident AMs from recruited monocytes. Lastly, other AM datasets were projected onto our dataset. Similar AM superclusters and functional subclusters were observed, along with changes in AM subclusters in individuals infected with COVID-19. Overall, functional specializations of the AM subclusters suggest that there are highly regulated AM niches with defined programming states, highlighting a clear division of labor.\n\nSummary BlurbThere are at least 14 AM subtypes; their frequency, along with other immune cells, are highly conserved across individuals suggesting a specific niche exists for each leukocyte population.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478325v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9fd85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b33a9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cddcaeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1535215_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) is a promising approach to cancer immunotherapy, but its efficiency fundamentally depends on the extent of tumor-specific T-cell enrichment within the graft. This can be estimated via activation with identifiable neoantigens, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), or living or lyzed tumor cells, but these approaches remain laborious, time-consuming, and functionally limited, hampering clinical development of ACT. Here, we demonstrate that homology cluster analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires efficiently identifies tumor-reactive TCRs allowing to: 1) detect their presence within the pool of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); 2) optimize TIL culturing conditions, with IL-2low/IL-21/anti-PD-1 combination showing increased efficiency; 3) investigate surface marker-based enrichment for tumor-targeting T cells in freshly-isolated TILs (enrichment confirmed for CD4+ and CD8+ PD-1+/CD39+ subsets), or re-stimulated TILs (informs on enrichment in 4-1BB-sorted cells). We believe that this approach to the rapid assessment of tumor-specific TCR enrichment should accelerate T cell therapy development.",

    "abstract": "In addition to coordinating the storage and mobilization of neutral fat, lipid droplets (LDs) are conserved organelles that can accommodate additional cargos in order to support animal development. However, it is unclear if each type of cargo is matched with a specific subset of LDs. Is the identity of each subset rigidly maintained? Here, we report that SEIP-1/seipin defines a subset of oocyte LDs that are required for proper eggshell formation in C. elegans. Using a photoconvertible fluorescent protein-based imaging assay, we found that SEIP-1 positive LDs were selectively depleted after fertilization, coincident of the formation of a lipid-rich permeability barrier of the eggshell. Loss of SEIP-1 function caused impenetrant embryonic arrest, which could be suppressed by depleting a LD-structural protein PLIN-1/perilipin. The embryonic development of seip-1; plin-1 mutant in turn depended on another LD-associated protein, RAB-18/Rab18. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that SEIP-1 dependent and independent mechanisms act redundantly to ensure the packaging and export of lipid-rich permeability barrier constituents via LDs. The identity of these LDs, as defined by their associated proteins, exhibits unexpected plasticity that ultimately ensures the survival of embryos ex utero.",

Although factors involved in mRNA transport have been characterized, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of this critical process and its regulation is lacking. Here, we use single RNA imaging to show that cells use selective mRNA retention to re-wire mRNA export during stress. We demonstrate that upon glucose withdrawal the essential export factor Nab2 forms RNA-dependent condensates in the nucleus blocking bulk mRNA export while selectively allowing the transport of stress-induced mRNAs. This is accompanied by reduced abundance of the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 at the nuclear pore, and experimental Dbp5 depletion triggers Nab2 condensation and nuclear mRNA accumulation. Condensation can be recapitulated in vitro, with Nab2 forming RNA-dependent liquid droplets, which fail to form in the presence of active Dbp5. Our results suggest that cells use condensation to selectively regulate mRNA export and to control gene expression during stress.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe nuclear Poly(A)-binding protein Nab2 forms condensates upon acute cellular depletion of the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5\nC_LIO_LINab2 dimerization but not its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are essential for condensation in vitro and in vivo\nC_LIO_LIGlucose stress leads to global mRNA retention in the nucleus and depends on Nab2 condensation\nC_LIO_LINab2 condensation confers selectivity of RNA retention during glucose stress\nC_LIO_LIProper Nab2 condensation is essential for survival after prolonged stress\nC_LI",

Employing a new deconvolution algorithm, BayesPrism, to pair single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we cartograph the lymphatic ligand:ISC receptor interactomes at high resolution. We unearth crypt lymphatics as a major source of WNT-signaling factors (WNT2, R-SPONDIN-3) known to drive ISC behavior, and REELIN, a hitherto unappreciated ISC regulator secreted by crypt lymphatics.

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, thyroid hormones, including thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are critical players in controlling different physiological processes such as development, growth, metabolism among others. There is evidence in mammals that thyroid hormones are also an important component of the hormonal system that controls reproduction, although studies in fish remain poorly investigated. Here we tested this hypothesis by investigating the effects of methimazole-induced hypothyroidism on the testicular function in adult D. rerio. Treatment of fish with methimazole, in vivo, significantly affected the progression of zebrafish spermatogenesis by inducing the accumulation of pre-meiotic cells, delaying cell differentiation and meiosis, as well as reducing the number of spermatozoa. The observed impairment of spermatogenesis by methimazole was correlated with significant changes in transcript levels for several genes involved in the control of reproduction. Using an in vitro approach, we also demonstrated that in addition to affecting the components of the brain-pituitary-peripheral axis, T3 also exerts direct action at the level of the testis. These results support the hypothesis that thyroid hormones are an essential component of multifactorial control of reproduction and testicular function in zebrafish and possibly other vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation has emerged as a powerful technology - both as a biological tool and for broadening the therapeutic proteome. As tools to probe this approach on historically intractable targets, we have previously advanced  biodegraders -- targeted degradation fusion constructs composed of mini-proteins/peptides linked to modified E3 ligase receptors. Herein, we gain deeper insights into the utility and potential of biodegraders, through a detailed study on Con1-SPOP, a biodegrader which rapidly degrades the potential cancer target, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In a variety of settings, the active biodegrader (Con1-SPOP) proved pharmacologically superior to its stoichiometric (non-degrading) inhibitor equivalent (Con1-SPOPmut). Specifically, in addition to more potent anti-proliferative effects in both 2D cell culture and 3D spheroids, PCNA degradation uniquely induced DNA damage, cell apoptosis and necrosis. Global proteomic profiling of a stable cell-line expressing Con1-SPOP under doxycycline (Dox) induction revealed that impaired mitotic division and mitochondria dysfunction is a direct consequence of PCNA degradation, effects not seen with the stoichiometric inhibitor protein. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of biodegraders, we showed that Dox-induced Con1-SPOP achieved complete tumor-growth inhibition in a xenograft model. To explore application of biodegraders as a novel therapeutic modality, modified mRNA encoding Con1-SPOP was synthesized and encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The approach successfully delivered mRNA in vitro to deplete endogenous PCNA within hours of application and with nanomolar potency. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of biodegraders as biological tools and highlight target-degradation as a more efficacious approach versus stoichiometric inhibition. Finally, once in vivo delivery and expression are optimized, biodegraders may be leveraged as an exciting therapeutic modality.",

    "abstract": "Diversity in the human genome is one factor that confers resistance and susceptibility to infectious diseases. This is observed most dramatically during pandemics, where individuals exhibit large differences in risk and clinical outcomes against a pathogen infecting large portions of the worlds populations. Here, we developed scHi-HOST (single cell High-throughput Human in vitrO Susceptibility Testing), a method for rapidly identifying genetic variants that confer resistance and susceptibility to pathogens. scHi-HOST leverages scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA-sequencing) to simultaneously assign genetic identity to individual cells in mixed infections of cell lines of European, African, and Asian origin, reveal associated genetic variants for viral entry and replication, and identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Applying scHi-HOST to influenza A virus (IAV), we identified eQTLs at baseline and in genes that are induced by IAV infection. Integration of scHi-HOST with a human IAV challenge study (Prometheus) revealed that a missense variant in ERAP1 (Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1; rs27895) was associated with IAV burden in cells and human volunteers. Functional studies using RNA interference, ERAP1 inhibitor, and overexpression of alternative alleles demonstrated that ERAP1 is exploited by IAV to promote infection. Specifically, the nonsynonymous substitution, which results in a glycine to aspartate substitution at ERAP1 residue 348, would disrupt the substrate binding pocket of ERAP1, likely resulting in a significantly altered preference for substrates, poorer catalytic efficiency, or both. Finally, rs27895 exhibits substantial population differentiation, with the higher frequency of the minor T allele in two African populations likely contributing to the greater permissivity of cells from these populations to IAV infection. scHi-HOST is an important resource for understanding susceptibility to influenza and is a broadly applicable method for decoding human genetics of infectious disease.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting promotes differential expression of parental alleles in the endosperm of flowering plants, and is regulated by epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone tail modifications in chromatin. After fertilization, the endosperm develops through a syncytial stage before it cellularizes and becomes a nutrient source for the growing embryo. Both in early and late endosperm development regional compartmentalization has been shown, and different transcriptional domains suggest divergent spatial and temporal regional functions. The analysis of the role of parent-of-origin allelic expression in the endosperm as a whole and also investigation of domain specific functions has been hampered by the availability of the tissue for high-throughput transcriptome analyses and contamination from surrounding tissue. Here we have used Fluorescence-Activated Nuclear Sorting (FANS) of nuclear targeted eGFP fluorescent genetic markers to capture parental specific allelic expression from different developmental stages and specific endosperm domains. This RNASeq approach allows us to successfully identify differential genomic imprinting with temporal and spatial resolution. In a systematic approach we report temporal regulation of imprinted genes in the endosperm as well as region specific imprinting in endosperm domains. Our data identifies loci that are spatially differentially imprinted in one domain of the endosperm while biparentally expressed in other domains. This suggests that regulation of genomic imprinting is dynamic and challenges the canonical mechanisms for genomic imprinting.",

    "abstract": "We carried out monthly surveys of the giant otter population between 2010 and 2020 in a study area comprised of 1,500 hectares of igapo flooded forest with oxbow lakes in the Cantao region of central Brazil. We recorded 16-32 resident adults in the study area each year, distributed in 4-8 groups. Resident groups exhibited extensive home range overlap, with each group using several lakes and larger lakes used in rotation by up to six groups. Dens and campsites were also shared by multiple groups, but lakes were used by only one group at a time, and encounters between groups were very rare. 24 adult otters were observed to join an existing group. Some individuals changed groups multiple times. Resident adult turnover was high. Each year an average of 36% of resident adults were new immigrants, and 72% of groups left the area within two years. Resident groups had, on average, one litter every three years, and annual cub production showed high variability and a negative correlation to the number of new immigrants in the area. No pairs of giant otters reproduced successfully during the study. Groups of three otters formed through the recruitment of an adult individual by an existing pair and reproduced as successfully as larger groups. Group dynamics and territorial behavior in the Cantao flooded forest ecosystem, where optimal giant otter habitat is continuous in all directions, were found to be different from that reported in areas composed of patchy (isolated oxbow lakes) or linear (rivers) habitat. This suggest that giant otter social and territorial behavior is plastic and adapts to the spatial characteristics of the habitat.",

    "abstract": "In vitro models of human organs must accurately reconstitute oxygen concentrations and gradients that are observed in vivo to mimic gene expression, metabolism, and host-microbiome interactions. Here we describe a simple strategy to achieve physiologically relevant oxygen tension in a two-channel human small intestine-on-a-chip (Intestine Chip) lined with primary human duodenal epithelium and intestinal microvascular endothelium in parallel channels separated by a porous membrane while both channels are perfused with oxygenated medium. This strategy was developed using computer simulations that predicted lowering the oxygen permeability of poly-dimethlysiloxane (PDMS) chips in specified locations using a gas impermeable film will allow the cells to naturally decrease the oxygen concentration through aerobic respiration and reach steady-state oxygen levels < 36 mm Hg (< 5%) within the epithelial lumen. The approach was experimentally confirmed using chips with embedded oxygen sensors that maintained this stable oxygen gradient. Furthermore, Intestine Chips cultured with this approach supported formation of a villus epithelium interfaced with a continuous endothelium and maintained intestinal barrier integrity for 72 h. This strategy recapitulates in vivo functionality in an efficient, inexpensive, and scalable format that improves the robustness and translatability of Organ Chip technology for studies on microbiome as well as oxygen sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian carcinoma (OC) forms outgrowths that extend from the outer surface of an afflicted organ into the peritoneum. OC outgrowth formation is poorly understood because there is limited availability of OC cell culture models to examine the behavior of cell assemblies that form outgrowths. Prompted by immunochemical evaluation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, laminin {gamma}1 and collagens, in human tissues representing untreated and chemotherapy-recovered OC, we developed laminin- and collagen-rich ECM-reconstituted cell culture models amenable to studies of cell clusters that can form outgrowths. We demonstrate that ECM promotes outgrowth formation in fallopian tube non-ciliated epithelial cells (FNE) expressing mutant p53-R175H and various OC cell lines. Outgrowths were initiated by cells that had undergone outward translocation and, upon mechanical detachment, could intercalate into mesothelial cell monolayers. Electron microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and small amplitude oscillatory shear experiments revealed that high ECM concentration increased ECM fibrous network thickness and led to high shear elasticity in the ECM environment. These physical characteristics were associated with the suppression of outgrowths. A culture environment with low ECM concentration mimicked viscoelasticity of malignant peritoneal fluids (ascites) and supported cell proliferation, cell translocation, and outgrowth formation. These results highlight the importance of ECM microenvironments in modulating OC growth and could provide an additional explanation of why primary and recurrent ovarian tumors form outgrowths that protrude into the peritoneal cavity.",

    "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) has strong effects on neurogenesis and axon pathfinding in the prenatal brain. Endocannabinoids that activate CB1R are abundant in the early postnatal brain and in mothers milk, but few studies have investigated their function in newborns. We examined postnatal CB1R expression in the major striatonigral circuit from striosomes of the striatum to the dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra. CB1R enrichment was first detectable between postnatal days 5 and 7, and this timing coincided with the formation of  striosome-dendron bouquets, the elaborate anatomical structures by which striosomal neurons control dopaminergic cell activity through inhibitory synapses. In Cnr1-/- knockouts lacking CB1R expression, striosome-dendron bouquets were markedly disorganized by postnatal day 11 and at adulthood, suggesting a postnatal pathfinding connectivity function for CB1R in connecting striosomal axons and dopaminergic neurons analogous to CB1Rs prenatal function in other brain regions. Our finding that CB1R plays a major role in postnatal wiring of the striatonigral dopamine system, with lasting consequences at least in mice, points to a crucial need to determine whether lactating mothers use of CB1R agonists (e.g., in marijuana) or antagonists (e.g., type 2 diabetes therapies) can disrupt brain development in nursing offspring.",

    "abstract": "Protein degradation is critical for brain function through processes that remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the in vivo function of a recently reported neuronal membrane-associated proteasome (NMP) in the brain of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. We demonstrated that NMPs are present in the tadpole brain with biochemistry and electron microscopy, and showed that they actively degrade neuronal activity-induced nascent proteins. Using in vivo calcium imaging in the optic tectum, we showed that acute inhibition of NMP function rapidly increased spontaneous neuronal activity, resulting in hyper-synchronization among tectal neurons. At the circuit level, inhibiting NMPs abolished learning-dependent improvement in a visuomotor behavior paradigm in live animals. Our data provide the first in vivo characterization of NMP functions in the vertebrate nervous system and suggest that NMP-mediated degradation of activity-induced nascent proteins may serve as a homeostatic modulatory mechanism in neurons that is critical for regulating neuronal activity and experience-dependent circuit plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The ability to associate sensory stimuli with abstract classes is critical for survival. How are these associations implemented in brain circuits? And what governs how neural activity evolves during abstract knowledge acquisition? To investigate these questions, we consider a circuit model that learns to map sensory input to abstract classes via gradient descent synaptic plasticity. We focus on typical neuroscience tasks (simple, and context-dependent, categorization), and study how both synaptic connectivity and neural activity evolve during learning. To make contact with the current generation of experiments, we analyze activity via standard measures such as selectivity, correlations, and tuning symmetry. We find that the model is able to recapitulate experimental observations, including seemingly disparate ones. We determine how, in the model, the behaviour of these measures depends on details of the circuit and the task. These dependencies make experimentally-testable predictions about the circuitry supporting abstract knowledge acquisition in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Invasive electromyography opened a new window to explore motoneuron behaviour in vivo. However, the technique is limited by the small fraction of active motoneurons that can be concurrently detected, precluding a population analysis in natural tasks. Here, we developed a high-density intramuscular electrode for in vivo human recordings along with a fully automatic methodology that could detect the discharges of action potentials of up to 67 concurrently active motoneurons with 99% accuracy. These data revealed that motoneurons of the same pool receive common synaptic input at frequencies up to 75 Hz and that late recruited motoneurons inhibit the discharges of those recruited earlier. These results constitute an important step in the population coding analysis of the human motor system in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the consequences of mutation for molecular fitness and function is a fundamental problem in biology. Recently, generative probabilistic models have emerged as a powerful tool for estimating fitness from evolutionary sequence data, with accuracy sufficient to predict both laboratory measurements of function and disease risk in humans, and to design novel functional proteins. Existing techniques rest on an assumed relationship between density estimation and fitness estimation, a relationship that we interrogate in this article. We prove that fitness is not identifiable from observational sequence data alone, placing fundamental limits on our ability to disentangle fitness landscapes from phylogenetic history. We show on real datasets that perfect density estimation in the limit of infinite data would, with high confidence, result in poor fitness estimation; current models perform accurate fitness estimation because of, not despite, misspecification. Our results challenge the conventional wisdom that bigger models trained on bigger datasets will inevitably lead to better fitness estimation, and suggest novel estimation strategies going forward.",
