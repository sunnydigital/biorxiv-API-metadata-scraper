    "abstract": "The alfalfa leafcutting bee Megachile rotundata Fabricius (HYMENOPTERA: Megachilidae) is an important pollinator for multiple agricultural seed commodities in the United States. Megachile rotundata is a solitary bee that forms brood cocoons where its larvae can develop. During the developmental stages of growth, broods can be preyed upon by multiple different fungal and bacterial pathogens and insect predators and parasitoids, resulting in the loss of the developing larvae. Larval loss is a major concern for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) seed producers because they rely on pollinator services provided by Megachile rotundata and reduced pollination rates result in lower yields and increased production costs. In the present study, we examined the taxonomic composition of organisms found within M. rotundata brood cells using a multiplex PCR assay which was developed for the detection of the most common bacterial, fungal, and invertebrate pests and pathogens of M. rotundata larvae. Known pests of M. rotundata were detected, including members of the fungal genus Ascosphaera, the causative agent of chalkbrood. Co-infection of single brood cells by multiple Ascosphaera species was confirmed, with potential implications for chalkbrood disease management. The multiplex assay also identified DNA from more than 2,400 total species including multiple new predators and pathogenetic species not previously documented in associated with M. rotundata brood cells.",

    "abstract": "The alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) is one of the primary pollinators for the alfalfa seed industry. The alfalfa leafcutting bee is a solitary cavity nesting bee. Female Megachile rotundata bees will construct and provision individual brood cells lined with cut leaves (cocoon) and will gather nectar and pollen to place within the constructed cocoon. The female bee will lay a single egg within the constructed cocoon and leave the egg to undergo larval stage development and pupation into the adult stage. During this time multiple pathogens and parasitoids can prey on the developing larvae, resulting in the loss of the future adult bee. A major concern for commercial alfalfa seed growers is the presence of invertebrate pests and fugal pathogens. In the present study, we used historical data from the Parma Cocoon Diagnostic Laboratory to determine baseline rates of pathogen and parasite infection of Megachile rotundata cells and used this analysis to determine historical infection rates and cutoffs for management practices. Additionally, using a Faxitron (X-ray) analysis for Megachile rotundata cell obtained in 2020, we compared the presence of chalkbrood, pathogens, and parasitoids in samples collected from both growers stocks and newly purchased Canada bees. The results of the investigation demonstrate historical averages of the presence of chalkbrood, pathogens, and parasitoids. We also show a significant increase in chalkbrood and predators in 2007-2011 and a significant difference in chalkbrood and predators between bee samples obtained from Canada and grower stocks.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe identification and role of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains controversial. Single-cell omics analysis can shed light on EPCs and their potential contribution to PAH pathobiology.\n\nObjectivesWe aim to identify EPCs in rat lungs and assess their relevance to preclinical and human PAH.\n\nMethodsDifferential expression, gene set enrichment, cell-cell communication, and trajectory reconstruction analyses were performed on lung endothelial cells from single-cell RNA-seq of Sugen-hypoxia, monocrotaline, and control rats. Relevance to human PAH was assessed in multiple independent blood and lung transcriptomic datasets.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsA subpopulation of endothelial cells (EA2) marked by Tm4sf1, a gene strongly implicated in cancer, harbored a distinct transcriptomic signature including Bmpr2 downregulation that was enriched for pathways such as inflammation and angiogenesis. Cell-to-cell communication networks specific to EA2 were activated in PAH such as CXCL12 signaling. Trajectory analysis demonstrated EA2 has a stem/progenitor cell phenotype. Analysis of independent datasets revealed Tm4sf1 is a marker for hematopoietic stem cells and is upregulated in PAH peripheral blood, particularly in patients with worse WHO functional class. EA2 signature genes including Procr and Sulf1 were found to be differentially regulated in the lungs of PAH patients and in PAH models in vitro, such as BMPR2 knockdown.\n\nConclusionsOur study uncovered a novel Tm4sf1-marked stem/progenitor subpopulation of rat lung endothelial cells and demonstrated its relevance to preclinical and human PAH. Future experimental studies are warranted to further elucidate the pathogenic role and therapeutic potential of targeting EA2 and Tm4sf1 in PAH.",

    "abstract": "Microporous annealed particle (MAP) hydrogels are an exciting new development in biomaterial design. They regulate innate and acquired immunity which has been linked to their ability to evade normal host-material fibrosis. Yet, resident stromal fibroblasts, not immune cells, are the arbiters of the extracellular matrix assembly that characterizes fibrosis. In other idiopathic fibrotic disorders, a fibroblast subpopulation defined by its loss of cell surface Thy-1 expression is strongly correlated with degree of fibrosis. We have previously shown that Thy-1 is a critical v{beta}3 integrin regulator that enables normal fibroblast mechanosensing and here, leveraging non-fibrosing MAP gels, we demonstrate that Thy-1-/- mice mount a robust response to MAP gels that remarkably resembles a classical foreign body response. We further find that within the naive, Thy-1+ fibroblast population exists a distinct and cryptic SMA+ Thy-1- population that emerges in response to IL-1{beta} and TNF. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that IL-1{beta}/TNF-induced Thy-1- fibroblasts actually consist of two distinct subpopulations, both of which are strongly pro-inflammatory. These findings illustrate the emergence of a unique pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic fibroblast subpopulation that is central to material-associated fibrosis likely through amplifying local inflammatory signaling.\n\nSignificance StatementDespite decades of research, implanted biomaterials are still significantly hampered by the foreign body response and fibrotic encapsulation.\n\nAdvancements in material design and immunomodulation have made positive impacts, yet, a fuller mechanistic understanding of aberrant ECM remodeling in the biomaterial microenvironment could improve approaches in biomaterial-host interactions. Here, we leverage anti-fibrotic MAP hydrogels and demonstrate that their ability to evade fibrosis is linked to fibroblast Thy-1 (CD90) surface expression. Thy-1-/- mice exhibit elevated NF{kappa}B signaling and elevated fibrosis in response to MAP gel implantation. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory cytokines elicit a Thy-1-/SMA+ myofibroblast subpopulation. Single-cell RNA-Seq more fully identifies an  immunofibroblast subpopulation defined by Thy-1 loss and a pro-inflammatory/fibrotic cytokine, chemokine, and cytokine receptor expression profile, suggesting a self-perpetuating pro-fibrotic subpopulation.",

    "abstract": "A restriction endonuclease (RE) is an enzyme that can recognize a specific DNA sequence and cleave that DNA into fragments with double-stranded breaks. This sequence-specific cleaving ability and its ease of use have made REs commonly used tools in molecular biology since their first isolation and characterization in 1970s. While artificial REs still face many challenges in large-scale synthesis and precise activity control for practical use, searching for new REs in natural samples remains a viable route for expanding the RE pool for fundamental research and industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to search for REs in an efficient fashion. Briefly, we construct a host bacterial cell to link the RE genotype to the phenotype of {beta}-galactosidase expression based on the bacterial SOS response, and use a high-throughput microfluidic platform to isolate, detect and sort the REs. We employ this strategy to screen for the XbaI gene from constructed libraries of varied sizes. In single round of sorting, a 30-fold target enrichment was obtained within 1 h. The direct screening approach we propose shows potential for efficient search of desirable REs in natural samples compared to the conventional RE-screening method, and is amenable to being adapted to high-throughput screening of other genotoxic targets.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessels anastomosis is one of the most challenging and delicate tasks to learn in many surgical specialties, especially for vascular and abdominal surgeons. Such a critical skill implies a learning curve that goes beyond technical execution. The surgeon needs to gain proficiency in adapting gestures and the amount of force expressed according to the type of tissue he/she is dealing with. In this context, surgical simulation is gaining a pivotal role in the training of surgeons, but currently available simulators can provide only standard or simplified anatomies, without the chance of presenting specific pathological conditions and rare cases.\n\n3D printing technology, allowing the manufacturing of extremely complex geometries, find a perfect application in the production of realistic replica of patient-specific anatomies. According to available technologies and materials, morphological aspects can be easily handled, while the reproduction of tissues mechanical properties still poses major problems, especially when dealing with soft tissues.\n\nThe present work focuses on blood vessels, with the aim of identifying - by means of both qualitative and quantitative tests - materials combinations able to best mimic the behavior of the biological tissue during anastomoses, by means of J750 Digital Anatomy technology and commercial photopolymers from Stratasys. Puncture tests and stitch traction tests are used to quantify the performance of the various formulations. Surgical simulations involving anastomoses are performed on selected clinical cases by surgeons to validate the results.\n\nA total of 37 experimental materials were tested and 2 formulations were identified as the most promising solutions to be used for anastomoses simulation. Clinical applicative tests, specifically selected to challenge the new materials, raised additional issues on the performance of the materials to be considered for future developments.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimers disease (AD) remains elusive, especially at the cell type level. Gene regulatory network, a key molecular mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern target gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, it is still challenging to understand how cell type networks work abnormally under AD. To address this, we integrated single-cell multi-omics data and predicted the gene regulatory networks in AD and control for four major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes. Importantly, we applied network biology approaches to analyze the changes of network characteristics across these cell types, and between AD and control. For instance, many hub TFs target different genes between AD and control (rewiring). Also, these networks show strong hierarchical structures in which top TFs (master regulators) are largely common across cell types, whereas different TFs operate at the middle levels in some cell types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g., feed-forward loops) further uncover cell-type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in gene regulation. The cell type networks are highly modular. Several network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are enriched with AD-risk genes and putative targets of approved and pending AD drugs, suggesting possible cell-type genomic medicine in AD. Finally, using the cell type gene regulatory networks, we developed machine learning models to classify and prioritize additional AD genes. We found that top prioritized genes predict clinical phenotypes (e.g., cognitive impairment). Overall, this single-cell network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals mechanisms on cell-type gene dyregulation in AD.",

    "abstract": "Little is known of how the deep root systems of perennial crops contribute to deeper and better resource use when intercropped with annuals in arable fields. Therefore, we aimed at measuring the capacity of perennial deep roots, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and curly dock (Rumex crispus L.) to access the nutrient source located under the neighboring annuals at 1.0 and 2.5 m of soil depth. Alfalfa and curly dock were able to access the tracer-labelled source placed at a distance under the annual crop strips. As a result, the reliance on deeper soil layer for nutrient uptake under intercroppings became greater compared with sole-croppings. Combination of an annual cereal (winter rye) and a perennial legume (alfalfa) with contrasting root systems exhibited higher resource complementarity compared with intercroppings having similar root systems or absence of legumes. Our results demonstrated that the deep-rooted perennials when intercropped with annuals can induce vertical niche complementarity, especially at deeper soil layers. This was assumed to be due to the vertically stratified root activity between the crop components, however, the magnitude of the effects depended on choice of crop combinations, and on types of tracers. Future studies should include estimates such as relative yield total and land equivalent ratio to quantitatively determine the effects of resource acquisition under annual-perennial intercropping in arable fields.",

Although over 1500 proteins are associated with RNAs in human cells, their binding motifs, targets and functions still remain to be elucidated, especially in the complex environment of human tissues and in the context of diseases. To overcome the lack of methods for systematic and automated detection of sequence motif-guided changes in pre-mRNA processing based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data we have developed MAPP (Motif Activity on Pre-mRNA Processing). We demonstrate MAPPs functionality by applying it to RNA-seq data from 284 RBP knock-down experiments in the ENCODE project, from which MAPP not only infers position-dependent impact profiles of known regulators, but also reveals RBPs that modulate both the inclusion of cassette exons and the poly(A) site choice. Among these, the Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 (PTBP1) has a similar activity in glioblastoma samples. This highlights the ability of MAPP to unveil global regulators of mRNA processing under physiological and pathological conditions.",

High frequency optogenetic stimulation of the CS and US-activated ensembles or biochemical induction of synaptic potentiation in US-responsive neurons alone was sufficient to produce a context fear association without prior associative training. These results suggest that plasticity of CS inputs onto US-responsive amygdala neurons is a necessary and sufficient step in forming context fear associations, and that context discrimination is determined by the CS-specific amygdala inputs activated during retrieval.",

    "abstract": "In susceptible populations, stress is a major risk factor for the development of mental disorders, including depression. Estradiol, often considered a female hormone, is distributed in the male brain via aromatization of testosterone. The role of estrogen receptors (ERs) in male stress susceptibility and depression is not well understood. We found that absence of ER{beta} is associated with susceptibility to stress in male mice and that activity of ER{beta}-projecting neurons from the basolateral amygdala to nucleus accumbens is reduced in hypogonadal mice subjected to stress, while activation of this circuit reverses stress-induced maladaptive behaviors. We identified that absence of estradiol, but not testosterone per se, underlies stress susceptibility and that brain-selective delivery of estradiol prevents the development of depression-related behaviors. Our findings provide evidence for an estrogen-based mechanism underlying stress susceptibility and offer an unexpected therapeutic strategy for treating depression in males.",

    "abstract": "When viewing the actions of others, we not only see patterns of body movements, but we also \"see\" the intentions and social relations of people, enabling us to understand the surrounding social environment. Previous research has shown that experienced forensic examiners--Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) operators--convey superior performance in identifying and predicting hostile intentions from surveillance footages than novices. However, it remains largely unknown what visual content CCTV operators actively attend to when viewing surveillance footage, and whether CCTV operators develop different strategies for active information seeking from what novices do. In this study, we conducted computational analysis for the gaze-centered stimuli captured by experienced CCTV operators and novices eye movements when they viewed the same surveillance footage. These analyses examined how low-level visual features and object-level semantic features contribute to attentive gaze patterns associated with the two groups of participants. Low-level image features were extracted by a visual saliency model, whereas object-level semantic features were extracted by a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), AlexNet, from gaze-centered regions. We found that visual regions attended by CCTV operators versus by novices can be reliably classified by patterns of saliency features and DCNN features. Additionally, CCTV operators showed greater inter-subject correlation in attending to saliency features and DCNN features than did novices. These results suggest that the looking behavior of CCTV operators differs from novices by actively attending to different patterns of saliency and semantic features in both low-level and high-level visual processing. Expertise in selectively attending to informative features at different levels of visual hierarchy may play an important role in facilitating the efficient detection of social relationships between agents and the prediction of harmful intentions.\n\nAuthor SummaryImagine seeing a person walking toward another person menacingly on the street, we may instantly feel that some physical confrontation will happen in the next second. However, it remains unclear how we efficiently infer social intentions and outcomes from the observed dynamic visual input. To answer this question, CCTV experts, who have years of experience on observing social scenes and making online predictions of the action outcomes, provide a unique perspective. Here, we collected experts and novices eye movements when observing different action sequences and compared the attended visual information between groups. A saliency model was used to compare low-level visual features such as luminance and color, and a deep convolutional neural network was used to extract object-level semantic visual features. Our findings showed that experts obtained different patterns of low-level and semantic-level features in visual processing compared to novices. Thus, the expertise in selectively attending to informative features at different levels of visual hierarchy may play an important role in facilitating the efficient detection of social relationships between agents and the prediction of harmful intentions.",

    "abstract": "Differential rodent responses to the sex of human experimenters could have far reaching consequences in preclinical studies. Here, we show that the sex of human experimenters affects mouse behaviours and responses to the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine and its bioactive metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine. We found that mice manifest aversion to human male odours, preference to female odours, and increased susceptibility to stress when handled by male experimenters. This male induced aversion and stress susceptibility is mediated by the activation of brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons projecting from the entorhinal cortrex to hippocampal area CA1. We further establish that exposure to male scent prior to ketamine administration activates CRF neurons projecting from the entorhinal cortex to hippocampus, and that CRF is necessary and sufficient for ketamines in vivo and in vitro actions. Further understanding of the specific and quantitative contributions of the sex of human experimenters to different experimental outcomes in rodents may lead not only to reduced heterogeneity between studies, but also increased capability to uncover novel biological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Chronic peritoneal inflammation following pristane injection induces lupus with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and pulmonary capillaritis in C57BL/6 mice. The pathogenesis involves pristane-induced microvascular lung injury. BALB/c mice are resistant to endothelial injury and DAH. Lung disease in C57BL/6 mice is abolished by depleting monocytes/macrophages. The objective of this study was to define the role of myeloid subsets in DAH. Hemorrhage and vasculitis were abolished in Ccr2-/- mice, indicating involvement of bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages. Along with Ly6Chi monocytes, we found two subsets of circulating Ly6Clo monocytes: one CD138- and a novel CD138+ subset. Nr4a1-dependent patrolling Ly6Clo monocytes maintain vascular integrity after endothelial injury. Circulating Ly6CloCD138+ monocytes were associated with DAH and were absent in mice without DAH. They also were absent in Nr4a1-/- mice, whereas Ly6CloCD138- monocytes were unaffected. However, Nr4a1-/- mice were susceptible to pristane-induced DAH and lung vasculitis, suggesting that disease onset does not require Ly6CloCD138- monocytes. Peritoneal Ly6CloCD138+ M{phi} were unchanged in Nr4a1-/- mice, indicating that they are not derived from Ly6CloCD138+ monocytes. We conclude that pristane-induced lung microvascular lung injury stimulates a wave of Nr4h1-dependent Ly6CloCD138+ patrolling monocytes in an ineffectual effort to maintain vascular integrity in the face of ongoing endothelial damage.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal lymphocytes are crucial members of the mucosal immune system with impact over outcomes of intestinal health versus dysbiosis. Resolving intestinal lymphocyte complexity and function is a challenge, as the intestine provides cellular snapshots of a diverse spectrum of immune states. In pigs, intestinal lymphocytes are poorly described relative to humans or traditional model species. Enhanced understanding of porcine intestinal lymphocytes will promote food security and improve utility of pigs as a biomedical model for intestinal research. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to provide transcriptomic profiles of lymphocytes in porcine ileum, with 31,983 cells annotated into 26 cell types. Deeper interrogation revealed previously undescribed cells in porcine intestine, including SELLhi{gamma}{delta} T cells, group 1 and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and four subsets of B cells. Single-cell transcriptomes in ileum were compared to those in porcine blood, and subsets of activated lymphocytes were detected in ileum but not periphery. Comparison to scRNA-seq human and murine ileum data revealed a general consensus of ileal lymphocytes across species. Lymphocyte spatial context in porcine ileum was conferred through differential tissue dissection prior to scRNA-seq. Antibody-secreting cells, B cells, follicular CD4 {beta} T cells, and cycling T/ILCs were enriched in ileum with Peyers patches, while non-cycling{gamma}{delta} T, CD8 {beta} T, and group 1 ILCs were enriched in ileum without Peyers patches. scRNA-seq findings were leveraged to develop advanced toolsets for further identification of ILCs in porcine ileum via flow cytometry and in situ staining. Porcine ileal ILCs identified via scRNA-seq did not transcriptionally mirror peripheral porcine ILCs (corresponding to natural killer cells) but instead had gene signatures indicative of tissue- and activation-specific functions, indicating potentially similar roles to intestinal ILCs identified in humans. Overall, the data serve as a highly-resolved transcriptomic atlas of the porcine intestinal immune landscape and will be useful in further understanding intestinal immune cell function.",

We observed distinct significantly recurrent breakpoints in localized and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC), with pervasive alterations in noncoding regions flanking the AR, MYC, FOXA1, and LSAMP genes enriched in mCRPC and TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements enriched in localized prostate cancer. We defined nine subclasses of mCRPC based on signatures of structural variation, each associated with distinct genetic features and clinical outcomes.

    "abstract": "The tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) is a critical regulator of cancer progression and metastasis, significantly affecting the treatment response. Expression of collagen XVIII (ColXVIII), a ubiquitous component of basement membranes, is induced in many solid tumors, but its involvement in tumorigenesis has remained elusive. We show here that ColXVIII is markedly upregulated in human breast cancer (BC) cells and is closely associated with a poor prognosis in high-grade BC, especially in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and basal/triple-negative cases. We identified a novel mechanism of action for ColXVIII as a modulator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) signaling and show that it forms a complex with EGFR, HER2 and 6 integrin to promote cancer cell proliferation in a pathway involving its N-terminal portion and the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt cascades. In vivo studies with Col18a1 mouse models crossed with the MMTV-PyMT mammary carcinogenesis model showed that the short ColXVIII isoform promotes BC growth and metastasis in a tumor cell-autonomous manner. Moreover, the number of mammary cancer stem cells was significantly reduced in both mouse and human cell models upon ColXVIII inhibition. Finally, ablation of ColXVIII in human BC cells and the MMTV-PyMT model substantially improved the efficacy of certain EGFR/ERbB-targeting therapies, even abolishing resistance to EGFR/ErbB inhibitors in some cell lines. In summary, a new function is revealed for ColXVIII in sustaining the stemness properties of BC cells, and tumor progression and metastasis through EGFR/ErbB signaling, suggesting that targeting ColXVIII in the tumor milieu may have significant therapeutic potential.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCollagen XVIII is upregulated in breast cancer and promotes mammary carcinogenesis through EGFR/ErbB signaling and by sustaining cancer stem cells, so that its targeting improves the efficacy of ErbB-targeted therapies.",

Using diffusion tractography, we detailed PFC structural connectivity with three regions, namely the Hb, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and anterior thalamus (AT), and quantified the tract-specific microstructural integrity using diffusion tensor imaging within the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) in healthy and cocaine-addicted individuals. White matter microstructure in cocaine-addicted individuals was uniquely impaired in PFC-Hb projections in the ALIC, distinguishable from adjacent PFC-VTA and PFC-AT projections, with more pronounced abnormalities in short-term abstinence.

    "abstract": "Sex differences in brain activity evoked by sexual stimuli remain elusive despite robust evidence for stronger enjoyment of and interest towards sexual stimuli in men than in women. To test whether visual sexual stimuli evoke different brain activity patterns in men and women, we measured haemodynamic brain activity induced by visual sexual stimuli in two experiments in 91 subjects (46 males). In one experiment, the subjects viewed sexual and non-sexual film clips and dynamic annotations for nudity in the clips was used to predict their hemodynamic activity. In the second experiment, the subjects viewed sexual and non-sexual pictures in an event-related design. Males showed stronger activation than females in the visual and prefrontal cortices and dorsal attention network in both experiments. Furthermore, using multivariate pattern classification we could accurately predict the sex of the subject on the basis of the brain activity elicited by the sexual stimuli. The classification generalized across the experiments indicating that the sex differences were consistent. Eye tracking data obtained from an independent sample of subjects (N = 110) showed that men looked longer than women at the chest area of the nude female actors in the film clips. These results indicate that visual sexual stimuli evoke discernible brain activity patterns in men and women which may reflect stronger attentional engagement with sexual stimuli in men than women.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnodal transcranial direct current stimulation (aTDCS) of primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) can enhance corticomotor excitability. Yet, it is still unknown which current intensity produces the strongest effect on regional neural activity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (pc-ASL MRI) can map regional cortical blood flow (rCBF) and may thus be useful to probe the relationship between current intensity and neural response at the individual level.\n\nObjectiveHere we employed pc-ASL MRI to map acute rCBF changes during short-duration aTDCS of left M1-HAND. Using the rCBF response as a proxy for regional neuronal activity, we investigated if short-duration aTDCS produces an instantaneous dose-dependent rCBF increase in the targeted M1-HAND that may be useful for individual dosing.\n\nMethodsNine healthy right-handed participants received 30 seconds of aTDCS at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mA with the anode placed over left M1-HAND and cathode over the right supraorbital region. Concurrent pc-ASL MRI at 3 T probed TDCS-related rCBF changes in the targeted M1-HAND.

    "abstract": "Sudden unexpected death of epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of of death in patients with epilepsy. Due to the complicated pathogenesis of SUDEP, however, the exact mechanism of SUDEP remains elusive. Currently, although it is recognized that the seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) may be a main cause for SUDEP, other factors resulting in SUDEP can not be excluded e.g arrhythmias. Our previous findings indicated that the incidence of S-IRA and SUDEP evoked by acoustic stimulation or pentetrazol (PTZ) injection was significantly reduced by atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), suggesting that noradrenergic neurotransmission modulates S-IRA and SUDEP. Given that norepinephrine acts on the target to modulate respiratory and circulation function by targeting adrenergic receptor  and beta (a-AR and {beta}-AR) and the arrhythmias can be contributed to SUDEP. Meanwhile, to further test whether cardiac factors are implicated in S-IRA and SUDEP, we choose esmolol hydrochloride, a selective antagonist of {beta}1-AR to test it in our models. Our findings demonstrated that the lower incidence of S-IRA and SUDEP evoked by acoustic stimulation or PTZ injection in DBA/1 mice by administration with atomoxetine was significantly reversed by intraperitoneal (IP) of esmolol hydrochloride. Importantly, the data of electrocardiogram (ECG) showed that the cardiac arrhythmia including the ventricular tachycardia, ventricular premature beat and atrioventricular block can be evoked by acoustic stimulation or PTZ injection in our model. Administration of atomoxetine significantly reduced these arrhythmias and the incidence of S-IRA and SUDEP in our models. However, administration of esmolol hydrochloride with the dose without affecting ECG and mortality changing of DBA/1 significantly blocking the protective effects of atomoxetine on S-IRA and SUDEP in our models. Thus, the dysfunction of respiratory and circulation may be implicated in the pathogenesis of S-IRA and SUDEP. Enhancing the central norepinephrinergic neurotransmission in the brain contributes to inhibition of seizure-induced respiratory arrest by targeting {beta}1-AR locating in the cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the suppression effects of S-IRA by atomoxetine was significantly reversed by the norepinephrine neuronal degradation in the LC in our models. Furthermore, PTZ-induced Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of norepinephrine, activity but not TH content from the serum of left ventricle and the whole heart tissue was reduced following the S-IRA. Our findings will show a new light on decoding the pathogenesis of SUDEP concerning the pathway between the LC and heart.",

Hence, alternative strategies targeted to slow the progression or delay the onset of motor symptoms are still highly sought. Here we report the identification of a long-term striatal plasticity mechanism that delays for several months, the onset of motor deficits in a mouse PD model.

    "abstract": "Stress is an unavoidable condition in human life. Stressful events experienced during development, including in utero, have been suggested as one major pathophysiological mechanism for developing vulnerability towards neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in adulthood. One cardinal feature of such disorders is impaired cognitive ability, which may in part rely on abnormal structure and function of the hippocampus. In the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus is a site of continuous neurogenesis, a process that has been recently implicated in spatial pattern separation, a cognitive phenomenon that serves to reduce the degree of overlap in the incoming information to facilitate its storage with minimal interference. We previously reported that adult neurogenesis is altered by prenatal stress allowing us to hypothesize that prenatal stress may possibly lead to impairment in pattern separation. To test this hypothesis, both control (C) and prenatally stressed (PS) adult mice were tested for metric and contextual discrimination abilities. We report for the first time that prenatal stress impairs pattern separation process, a deficit that may underlie their cognitive alterations and that may result in defective behaviors reminiscent of psychiatric illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder.",

    "abstract": "While noise is an important factor in biology, biological processes often involve multiple noise sources, whose relative importance can be unclear. Here we develop tools that quantify the importance of noise sources in a network based on their contributions to variability in a quantity of interest. We generalize the edge importance measures proposed by Schmidt and Thomas [1] for first-order reaction networks whose steady-state variance is a linear combination of variance produced by each directed edge. We show that the same additive property extends to a general family of stochastic processes subject to a set of linearity assumptions, whether in discrete or continuous state or time. Our analysis applies to both expanding and contracting populations, as well as populations obeying a martingale (\"wandering\") at long times. We show that the original Schmidt-Thomas edge importance measure is a special case of our more general measure, and is recovered when the model satisfies a conservation constraint (\"persists\"). In the growing and wandering cases we show that the choice of observables (measurements) used to monitor the process does not influence which noise sources are important at long times. In contrast, in the shrinking or persisting case, which noise sources are important depends on what is measured. We also generalize our measures to admit models with affine moment update equations, which admit additional limiting scenarios, and arise naturally after linearization. We illustrate our results using examples from cell biology and ecology: (i) a model for the dynamics of the inositol trisphospate receptor, (ii) a model for an endangered population of white-tailed eagles, and (iii) a model for wood frog dispersal.\n\nAuthor summaryBiological processes are frequently subject to an ensemble of independent noise sources. Noise sources produce fluctuations that propagate through the system, driving fluctuations in quantities of interest such as population size or ion channel configuration. We introduce a measure that quantifies how much variability each noise source contributes to any given quantity of interest. Using these methods, we identify which binding events contribute significantly to fluctuations in the state of a molecular signalling channel, which life history events contribute the most variability to an eagle population before and after a successful conservation effort rescued the population from the brink of extinction, and which dispersal events, at what times, matter most to variability in the recolonization of a series of ponds by wood frogs after a drought.",

    "abstract": "Understanding processes that determine community membership and abundance is important for many fields from theoretical community ecology to conservation. However, spatial community studies are often conducted only at a single timepoint despite the known influence of temporal variability on community assembly processes. Here we used a spatiotemporal study to determine how environmental fluctuation differences induced by mesocosm volumes (larger volumes were more stable) influence assembly processes of aquatic bacterial metacommunities along a press disturbance gradient. By combining path analysis and network approaches, we found mesocosm size categories had distinct relative influences of assembly process and environmental factors that determined spatiotemporal bacterial community composition, including dispersal and species sorting by conductivity. These processes depended on, but were not affected proportionately by, mesocosm size. Low fluctuation, large mesocosms primarily developed through the interplay of species sorting that became more important over time and transient priority effects as evidenced by more time-delayed associations. High fluctuation, small mesocosms had regular disruptions to species sorting and greater importance of ecological drift and dispersal limitation indicated by lower richness and higher taxa replacement. Together, these results emphasize that environmental fluctuations influence ecosystems over time and its impacts are modified by biotic properties intrinsic to ecosystem size.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiomes of humans carry a complex symbiotic assemblage of microorganisms. As in all mammals, the special mode of feeding newborn infants through milk from the mammary gland enhances the opportunity for vertical transmission of the milk microbiome from parents to the gut microbiome of offspring. This has potential benefits, but it also brings with it some hazards for the host. Here we use mathematical and numerical models to demonstrate that vertical transmission from both parents would allow host populations to be invaded by microbiome elements that are deleterious. In contrast, vertical transmission, when restricted to one parent, acts as a sieve preventing the spread of such elements. We show that deleterious symbionts generate selection for uniparental transmission in host populations, and that this selective advantage is maintained in the presence of moderate horizontal transmission. Some vertical transmission from mother to infant is bound to happen in placental mammals. This paper therefore puts forward the hypothesis that the asymmetry between females and males, together with the hazards that come with biparental transmission of the milk microbiome, generate selection against male lactation in humans, and in mammals in general.",

We present a study of a wild wheat population sampled over a 36-year period at high spatial resolution. We genotyped 832 individuals from regular sampling along transects during the course of the experiment. Genotypes were clustered into ecological microhabitats over scales of tens of metres, and this clustering was remarkably stable over the 36 generations of the study. Simulations show that it is difficult to explain this spatial and temporal stability using only limited dispersal, suggesting a role for fine-scale local adaptation to ecological parameters. Using a common-garden experiment, we showed that the genotypes found in distinct microhabitats differ phenotypically, further supporting the hypothesis of local adaptation.

We found that megabase-scale recombination landscapes in inbred lines are strikingly similar to the recombination landscapes in hybrids, with the sole exception of heterozygous large rearrangements where recombination is prevented locally. In addition, we found that the megabase-scale recombination landscape can be accurately predicted by chromatin features.

We comprehensively evaluated 18 functional weighting methods for identifying novel associations.

Although no method achieved both high sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for any trait, a subset of methods utilizing pleiotropy and expression quantitative trait loci nominated variants with high PPV (>75%) for multiple traits. Application of functionally weighting methods to enhance GWAS power for locus discovery is unlikely to circumvent the need for larger sample sizes in truly underpowered GWAS, but these results suggest that applying functional weighting to GWAS can accurately nominate additional novel loci from available samples for follow-up studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfectious disease spread in populations is controlled by individuals susceptibility (propensity to acquire infection), infectivity (propensity to pass on infection to others) and recoverability (propensity to recover/die). Estimating the effects of genetic risk factors on these host epidemiological traits can help reduce disease spread through genetic control strategies. However, the effects of previously identified  disease resistance SNPs on these epidemiological traits are usually unknown. Recent advances in computational statistics make it now possible to estimate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on these traits from longitudinal epidemic data (e.g. infection and/or recovery times of individuals or diagnostic test results). However, little is known how to optimally design disease transmission experiments or field studies to maximise the precision at which pleiotropic SNP effects estimates for susceptibility, infectivity and recoverability can be estimated.\n\nResultsWe develop and validate analytical expressions for the precision of SNP effects estimates on the three host traits assuming a disease transmission experiment with one or more non-interacting contact groups. Maximising these leads to three distinct  experimental designs, each specifying a different set of ideal SNP genotype compositions across groups: a) appropriate for a single contact-group, b) a multi-group design termed \"pure\", and c) a multi-group design termed \"mixed\", where  pure and  mixed refer to contact groups consisting of individuals with the same or different SNP genotypes, respectively. Precision estimates for susceptibility and recoverability were found to be less sensitive to the experimental design than infectivity. Data from multiple groups were found more informative about infectivity effects than from a single group containing the same number of individuals. Whilst the analytical expressions suggest that the multi-group pure and mixed designs estimate SNP effects with similar precision, the mixed design is preferable because it uses information from naturally occurring infections rather than those artificially induced. The same optimal design principles apply to estimating other categorical fixed effects, such as vaccinations status, helping to more effectively quantify their epidemiological impact.\n\nAn online software tool SIRE-PC has been developed which calculates the precision of estimated substitution and dominance effects of a single SNP (or vaccine status) associated with all three traits depending on experimental design parameters.\n\nConclusionsThe developed methodology and software tool can be used to aid the design of disease transmission experiments for estimating the effect of individual SNPs and other categorical variables underlying host susceptibility, infectivity and recoverability.",

We evaluated our algorithms in subjects with and without suspected age-related CS to assess whether physiological and behavioural markers associated with CS can be improved. Our data show that after applying our algorithms, envelope-following responses and perceptual amplitude-modulation sensitivity were consistently enhanced in both young and older listeners. Speech-in-noise intelligibility showed small improvements after processing but mostly for young normal-hearing participants, with median improvements of up to 8.3%. Since our hearing-enhancement strategies were designed to optimally drive the AN fibres, they were able to improve temporal-envelope processing for listeners both with and without suspected CS. Our proposed algorithms can be rapidly executed and can thus extend the application range of current hearing aids and hearables, while leaving sound amplification unaffected.",

    "abstract": "Coevolution is an important biological process that shapes interacting species or even proteins - may it be physically interacting proteins or consecutive enzymes in a metabolic pathway. The detection of co-evolved proteins will contribute to a better understanding of biological systems. Previously, we developed a semi-automated method, termed FunOrder, for the detection of co-evolved genes from an input gene or protein set. We demonstrated the usability and applicability of FunOrder by identifying essential genes in biosynthetic gene clusters from different ascomycetes. A major drawback of this original method was the need for a manual assessment, which may create a user bias and prevents a high-throughput application. Here we present a fully automated version of this method termed FunOrder 2.0. To fully automatize the method, we used several mathematical indices to determine the optimal number of clusters in the FunOrder output, and a subsequent k-means clustering based on the first three principal components of a principal component analysis of the FunOrder output. Further, we replaced the BLAST with the DIAMOND tool, which enhanced speed and allows the future integration of larger proteome databases. The introduced changes slightly decreased the sensitivity of this method, which is outweighed by enhanced overall speed and specificity. Additionally, the changes lay the foundation for future high-throughput applications of FunOrder 2.0 in different phyla to solve different biological problems.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCoevolution is a process which arises between different species or even different proteins that interact with each other. Any change occurring in one partner must be met by a corresponding change in the other partner to maintain the interaction throughout evolution. These interactions may occur in symbiotic relationships or between rivaling species. Within an organism, consecutive enzymes of metabolic pathways are also subjected to coevolution. We developed a fully automated method, FunOrder 2.0, for the detection of co-evolved proteins, which will contribute to a better understanding of protein interactions within an organism. We demonstrate that this method can be used to identify essential genes of the secondary metabolism of fungi, but FunOrder 2.0 may also be used to detect pathogenicity factors or remains of horizontal gene transfer next to many other biological systems that were shaped by coevolution.",

    "abstract": "Leaf morphology is one of the most important features of the ideal plant architecture. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling leaf morphology in crops remain largely unknown, despite their central importance. Here we demonstrate that the APC/CTAD1-WL1-NAL1 pathway regulates leaf width in rice, and mutation of WL1 leads to width leaf variation. WL1 interacts with TAD1 and is degraded by APC/CTAD1, with the loss of TAD1 function resulting in narrow leaves. The WL1 protein directly binds to the regulatory region of NAL1 and recruits the corepressor TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEIN to inhibit NAL1 expression by down-regulating the level of histone acetylation of chromatin. Furthermore, biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that TAD1, WL1, and NAL1 function in a common pathway to control leaf width. Our study establishes an important framework for the APC/CTAD1-WL1-NAL1 pathway-mediated control of leaf width in rice and introduces novel perspectives for using this regulatory pathway for improving crop plant architecture.",

The aim of the present study was to establish a new neonatal rat model by simulating hypoxia ischemia reperfusion brain damage (HIRBD) through \"common carotid artery (CCA) muscle bridge\".\n\nMethodsSixty 7-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to group A (HIRBD groups, n=36), group B (Rice-Vannucci group, n=12), and group C (sham-operated group, n=12). Rats in group A were assigned to 3 subgroups (A1-A3, 12 animals/subgroup). Dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) were evaluated by the laser speckle imaging system. The status of the CCA was observed under a stereomicroscope. Changes in body weight, gross morphology as well as pathological sections of brain tissue were examined to evaluate the feasibility of the model.\n\nResultsThe results indicated that CCA muscle bridge successfully blocked the CBF. CBF was restored after removal of the CCA muscle bridge in HIRBD groups. The CCA was in good condition after removing the muscle bridge, and blood supply was not affected. Changes in body weight, gross morphology and pathological sections of brain tissue indicated that ischemia reperfusion induced by the CCA muscle bridge method caused varying degrees of brain damage.\n\nConclusionCCA muscle bridge method is effective for establishing a reliable, stable, and reproducible neonatal rat model for study of HIRBD.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex receives multiple afferents from the thalamus that segregate by stimulus modality forming cortical maps for each sense. In vision, the primary visual cortex maps the multiple dimensions of the visual stimulus in patterns that vary across species for reasons unknown. Here we introduce a general theory of cortical map formation, which proposes that map diversity emerges from species variations in the thalamic afferent density sampling sensory space. In the theory, increasing afferent sampling density enlarges the cortical domains representing the same visual point, allowing the segregation of afferents and cortical targets by multiple stimulus dimensions. We illustrate the theory with an afferent-density model that accurately replicates the maps of different species through afferent segregation followed by thalamocortical convergence pruned by visual experience. Because thalamocortical pathways use similar mechanisms for axon segregation and pruning, the theory may extend to other sensory areas of the mammalian brain.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the study of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed that functional connectivity within and between networks are linked to cognitive states and pathologies. However, the white matter connections supporting connectivity remain only partially described. We developed a method to jointly map the white and grey matter contributing to each resting-state network. Using the Human Connectome Project, we generated an atlas of 30 resting-state networks. The method also allows highlighting the overlap between networks, which revealed that most of the brains white matter (89%) is shared between multiple networks, with 16% shared by at least 7 resting-state networks. These overlaps, especially the existence of regions shared by numerous networks, suggest that white matter lesions in these areas might strongly impact the correlations and the communication within resting-state networks. We provide an open-source software to explore the joint contribution of white and grey matter to RSNs and facilitate the study of the impact of white matter damage on RSNs. In a first clinical application of the software, we were able to link stroke patients and impacted resting-state networks, showing that their symptoms aligned well with the estimated functions of the networks.",

    "abstract": "Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) are widely used to index top-down cognitive processing in human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies. Typically, two stimuli flickering at different temporal frequencies (TFs) are presented, each producing a distinct response in the EEG at its flicker frequency. However, how SSVEP responses in EEG are modulated in the presence of a competing flickering stimulus just due to sensory interactions is not well understood. We have previously shown in local field potentials (LFP) recorded from awake monkeys that when two overlapping full screen gratings are counter-phased at different TFs, there is an asymmetric SSVEP response suppression, with greater suppression from lower TFs, which further depends on the relative orientations of the gratings (stronger suppression and asymmetry for parallel compared to orthogonal gratings). Here, we first confirmed these effects in both male and female human EEG recordings. Then, we mapped the response suppression of one stimulus (target) by a competing stimulus (mask) over a much wider range than the previous study. Surprisingly, we found that the suppression was not stronger at low frequencies in general, but systematically varied depending on the target TF, indicating local interactions between the two competing stimuli. These results were confirmed in both human EEG and monkey LFP and electrocorticogram (ECoG) data. Our results show that sensory interactions between multiple SSVEPs are more complex than shown previously and are influenced by both local and global factors, underscoring the need to cautiously interpret the results of studies involving SSVEP paradigms.",

Dopaminergic system was assessed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry and by chromatographic quantification of the whole-brain dopamine levels. Beam-walking test was also repeated after the treatment with the dopamine receptor antagonists, ecopipam and raclopride. The volumes of 20 brain regions in the CYP2C19 transgenic mice and controls were quantified by 9.4T gadolinium-enhanced postmortem structural neuroimaging.\n\nResultsCYP2C19 transgenic mice were found to exhibit abnormal, unilateral ataxia-like gait, clasping reflex and 5.6-fold more paw-slips using the beam-walking test (p<0.0001, n=89); the phenotype was more pronounced in younger animals. Hyperdopaminergism was observed in the CYP2C19 mice; however, the motoric impairment was not ameliorated by dopamine receptor antagonists and there was also no midbrain dopamine neuron loss in CYP2C19 mice. However, in these mice, cerebellar volume was drastically decreased (11.8% [95%CI: -14.7, -9.0], q<0.0001, n=59), whereas a moderate decrease in hippocampal volume was observed (-4.2% [95%CI: -6.4%, -1.9%], q=0.015, n=59).\n\nConclusionsHumanized CYP2C19 transgenic mice exhibit altered motoric function and functional motoric impairments; this phenotype is likely caused by an aberrant cerebellar development.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease with high morbidity and mortality caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). Cleaning and disinfection remain one of the most effective biosecurity measures to prevent and control the spread of ASFV. In this study, we evaluated the inactivation effects of highly complexed iodine (HPCI) combined with compound organic acids (COAs) against ASFV under different conditions. The results showed that the inactivation rates of the disinfectants on the reporter ASFV increased in dose- and time-dependent manners, the best inactivation effects were obtained when the compatibility ratio of HPCI and COAs was 5:1 at 25{degrees}C. Furthermore, there were no significant differences by comparing the efficacy of HPCI combined with COAs (HPCI+COAs) in inactivating wild-type ASFV and the reporter ASFV (P > 0.05). ASFV of 104.0 TCID50/mL was completely inactivated by 0.13% HPCI (0.0065% effective iodine), 0.06% COAs or 0.13% HPCI+COAs (approximately 0.0054% effective iodine), respectively, while 106.0 TCID50/mL ASFV was completely inactivated by 1.00% HPCI (0.05% effective iodine), 0.50% COAs or 1.00% HPCI+COAs (0.042% effective iodine), respectively. Therefore, HPCI+COAs had synergistic effects to inactivate ASFV. This study demonstrated that HPCI+COAs could rapidly and efficiently inactivate ASFV and represent an effective compound disinfectant for the control of ASF.\n\nIMPORTANCEAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease with high morbidity and mortality caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). Due to the lack of commercial vaccines and treatment available for ASF, effective disinfectants and the proper use of them are extremely essential to inactivate ASFV. The significance of this research is in searching for an ideal disinfectant that not only has the advantages of low toxicity and non-pollution but also can inactivate ASFV rapidly and efficiently. In this study, we proved that HPCI+COAs not only exhibited low cytotoxicity, but also could completely inactivate ASFV within 5 min at 4{degrees}C, 25{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C. In addition, HPCI+COAs had synergistic effects on inactivated ASFV. Thus, HPCI +COAs could be used as an effective disinfectant for the control of ASF.",

    "abstract": "Colony pattern formations of bacteria with motility manifest complicated morphological self-organization phenomena. Leptolyngbya boryana is the filamentous cyanobacterial species, which has been used as a genetic model organism for studying metabolism including photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation. Although a widely used type strain (wild type) of this species has not been reported to show any motile activity, we isolated a spontaneous mutant strain which shows active motility (gliding activity) to give rise to complicated colony patters, including comet-like wandering clusters and disk-like rotating vortices on solid media. Whole-genome resequencing identified multiple mutations on the genome in the mutant strain. We confirmed that inactivation of a candidate gene, dgc2 (LBDG_02920), in the wild type background was sufficient to give rise to motility and the morphological colony patterns. This gene encodes a protein, containing the GGDEF motif, which is conserved at the catalytic domain of diguanylate cyclase (DGC). Although DGC has been reported to be involved in biofilm formation, the mutant strain lacking dgc2 significantly facilitated biofilm formation, suggesting a role of DGC for suppressing both gliding motility and biofilm formation. Thus, L. boryana provides an excellent genetic model to study dynamic colony pattern formation, and novel insight on a role of c-di-GMP for biofilm formation.\n\nImportanceSelf-propelled bacteria often show complicated collective behaviors, such as the formation of dense moving clusters, which is exemplified by wandering comet-like and rotating disk-like colonies, while molecular details of forming such structures remain limited. We found that a strain deficient in the diguanylate cyclase gene dgc2 in the filamentous cyanobacterium L. boryana induces motility, complex and dynamic colony pattern formation including the comet-like and disk-like clusters. While c-di-GMP has been reported to activate biofilm formation in some bacterial species, disruption of the dgc2 gene unexpectedly enhanced it, providing a novel role for c-di-GMP regulatory system in both colony pattern formation and biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a facultative anaerobe that can grow in a variety of environmental conditions. In the complete absence of O2, E. coli can perform a mixed-acid fermentation that contains within it an elaborate metabolism of formic acid. In this study, we use cavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (CERS), FTIR, liquid Raman spectroscopy, isotopic labelling, and molecular genetics to make advances in the understanding of bacterial formate and H2 metabolism. It is shown that, under anaerobic (anoxic) conditions, formic acid is generated endogenously, excreted briefly from the cell, and then taken up again to be disproportionated to H2 and CO2 by formate hydrogenlyase (FHL-1). However, exogenously added D-labelled formate behaves quite differently from the endogenous formate and is taken up immediately, independently, and possibly by a different mechanism, by the cell and converted to H2 and CO2. Our data support an anion-proton symport model for formic acid transport. In addition, when E. coli was grown in a micro-aerobic (micro-oxic) environment it was possible to analyse aspects of formate and O2 respiration occurring alongside anaerobic metabolism. While cells growing under micro-aerobic conditions generated endogenous formic acid, no H2 was produced. However, addition of exogenous formate at the outset of cell growth did induce FHL-1 biosynthesis and resulted in formate-dependent H2 production in the presence of O2.",

Here, cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) is applied to reveal the neighboring domains of the flexible receptor. For AAV5, where the PKD1 domain is bound strongly, PKD2 is seen in three configurations extending away from the virus. AAV2 binds tightly to the PKD2 domain at a distinct site, and cryo-ET now reveals four configurations of PKD1, all different from that seen in AAV5. The AAV2 receptor complex also shows unmodeled features on the inner surface that appear to be an equilibrium alternate configuration. Other AAV structures start near the 5-fold axis, but now {beta}-strand A is the minor conformer and, for the major conformer, partially ordered N-termini near the 2-fold axis join the canonical capsid jellyroll fold at the {beta}A-{beta}B turn. The addition of cryo-ET is revealing unappreciated complexity that is likely relevant to viral entry and to the development of improved gene therapy vectors.\n\nIMPORTANCEWith 150 clinical trials for 30 diseases underway, AAV is a leading gene therapy vector. Immunotoxicity at high doses used to overcome inefficient transduction, has occasionally proven fatal and highlighted gaps in fundamental virology. AAV enters cells, interacting through distinct sites with different domains of the AAVR receptor, according to AAV clade. Single domains are resolved in structures by cryogenic electron microscopy. Here, the adjoining domains are revealed by cryo-electron tomography of AAV2 and AAV5 complexes. They are in flexible configurations interacting minimally with AAV, despite measurable dependence of AAV2 transduction on both domains.",

    "abstract": "The definition of bacterial species is traditionally a taxonomic issue while bacterial populations are identified by population genetics. These assignments are species specific, and depend on the practitioner. Legacy multilocus sequence typing is commonly used to identify sequence types (STs) and clusters (ST Complexes). However, these approaches are not adequate for the millions of genomic sequences from bacterial pathogens that have been generated since 2012. EnteroBase (http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk) automatically clusters core genome MLST allelic profiles into hierarchical clusters (HierCC) after assembling annotated draft genomes from short read sequences. HierCC clusters span core sequence diversity from the species level down to individual transmission chains. Here we evaluate HierCCs ability to correctly assign 100,000s of genomes to the species/subspecies and population levels for Salmonella, Escherichia, Clostridoides, Yersinia, Vibrio and Streptococcus. HierCC assignments were more consistent with maximum-likelihood super-trees of core SNPs or presence/absence of accessory genes than classical taxonomic assignments or 95% ANI. However, neither HierCC nor ANI were uniformly consistent with classical taxonomy of Streptococcus. HierCC was also consistent with legacy eBGs/ST Complexes in Salmonella or Escherichia and with O serogroups in Salmonella. Thus, EnteroBase HierCC supports the automated identification of and assignment to species/subspecies and populations for multiple genera.",

Previous reports demonstrate that the formation of so-called  round bodies and biofilms, and chemotaxis are involved in spirochete pathogenesis. Here, in the spirochete Treponema denticola, we report a direct link between these cellular states that involves a new class of protein sensor (CheWS) with hitherto unclear function. Using cryo-EM methods, protein modeling, bioinformatics, genetics methods, and behavioral assays we demonstrate that spirochetes regulate these behaviors in response to the small molecule s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) via a SAM sensor that is anchored to chemotaxis arrays. CheWS influences chemotaxis, biofilm and round body formation under nonstressed conditions by a novel sporulation-like mechanism. Taken together, we establish an improved model for round body formation, we discovered a direct link between this SAM sensor and changes in cellular states, as well as characterized a new sensor class involved in chemotaxis.",

We performed and integrated snATAC-seq and scRNA-seq from human IPF and donor control explants to identify differentially accessible chromatin regions and enriched transcription factor motifs within lung cell populations. TWIST1 and other E-box transcription factor motifs were significantly enriched in IPF myofibroblasts compared to both IPF non-myogenic and control fibroblasts. TWIST1 expression was also selectively upregulated in IPF myofibroblasts. Overexpression of Twist1 in lung COL1A2-expressing fibroblasts in bleomycin-injured mice was associated with increased collagen synthesis. Our studies utilizing human multiomic single-cell analyses combined with in vivo murine disease models confirm a critical regulatory function for TWIST1 in IPF myofibroblast activity in the fibrotic lung.

Nonetheless, the functions and modes of action that STAR proteins have in lineage specification are still poorly understood. Here, we characterized the role of STAR proteins SAM68 and QUAKING (QKI) in pluripotency and differentiation by performing their depletion through CRISPR-Cas9 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Combining RNA-sequencing, ribosome profiling and advanced computational predictions, we found that both SAM68 and QKI regulate the mESCs self-renewal and are indispensable for cardiomyocyte differentiation. At the molecular level, we discovered that SAM68 and QKI antagonistically control the expression of cardiogenic factors. Our calculations indicated that SAM68, unlike QKI, binds the cardiogenic-specific transcription factor Gata4 in a region spanning nucleotides 500 to 1000 of the mRNA corresponding to part of the 5 untranslated region and the first exon. We validated the predictions by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and RNA immunoprecipitation showing that SAM68 controls the translation of Gata4 during mESCs differentiation towards the cardiomyocyte lineage.",

Detergent-free technologies such as styrene-maleic acid lipid particles (SMALP), diisobutylene-maleic acid lipid particles (DIBMALP), and native cell membrane nanoparticles (NCMN) systems have recently emerged as revolutionary alternatives to the traditional detergent-based approaches for membrane protein research. NCMN systems aim to create a membrane-active polymer library suitable for high-resolution structure determination. Herein, we report our design, synthesis, characterization and comparative application analyses of three novel classes of NCMN polymers, NCMNP13-x, NCMNP21-x and NCMNP21b-x. Although each NCMN polymer can solubilize various model membrane proteins and conserve native lipids into NCMN particles, only the NCMNP21b-x series reveals lipid-protein particles with good buffer compatibility and high homogeneity suitable for single-particle cryo-EM analysis.

Deposition of H2A.Z requires ATP-dependent replacement of nucleosomal H2A by a chromatin remodeler related to the multi-subunit enzyme, yeast SWR1C. How these enzymes use ATP to promote this nucleosome editing reaction remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule and ensemble methodologies to identify three ATP-dependent phases in the H2A.Z deposition reaction. Real-time analysis of single nucleosome remodeling events reveals an initial, priming step that occurs after ATP addition that likely involves transient DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome. Priming is followed by rapid loss of histone H2A, which is subsequently released from the H2A.Z nucleosomal product. Surprisingly, the rates of both priming and the release of the H2A/H2B dimer are sensitive to ATP concentration. This complex reaction pathway provides multiple opportunities to regulate the timely and accurate deposition of H2A.Z at key genomic locations.",

In this study, we have developed drug-eluting antibacterial catheters to prevent catheter-related infections. Niclosamide (NIC), originally a well-studied antiparasitic drug, was incorporated into the polymeric matrix of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) via solvent casting, and catheters were fabricated using hot-melt extrusion technology. The mechanical and physicochemical properties of TPU polymers loaded with NIC were studied. NIC was released in a sustained manner from the catheters and exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in different in vitro models. Moreover, the antibacterial efficacy of NIC-loaded catheters was validated in an in vivo biomaterial-associated infection mouse model using a methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus. The released NIC from the produced catheters reduced bacterial colonization of the catheter as well as of the surrounding tissue. A sustained in vivo release of NIC from the catheters for at least 14 days was observed. In summary, the NIC-releasing hot-melt extruded catheters prevented implant colonization and reduced the bacterial colonization of peri-catheter tissue by methicillin sensitive as well as resistant S. aureus in a biomaterial-associated infection mouse model and has good prospects for preclinical development.",

    "abstract": "During the last few years, gene editing has emerged as a powerful tool for the therapeutic correction of monogenic diseases. CRISPR/Cas9 applied to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has shown great promise in proof-of-principle preclinical studies to treat haematological disorders, and clinical trials using these tools are now underway. Nonetheless, there remain important challenges that need to be addressed, such as the efficiency of targeting primitive, long-term repopulating HSPCs and expand them in vitro for clinical purposes. Here we have tested the effect exerted by different culture media compositions on the ability of HSPCs to proliferate and undergo homology directed repair-mediated knock-in of a reporter gene, while preserving their stemness features during ex-vivo culture. We tested different combinations of compounds and demonstrated that by supplementing the culture media with inhibitors of histone deacetylases, and/or by fine-tuning its cytokine composition it is possible to achieve high levels of gene targeting in long-term repopulating HSPCs both in vitro and in vivo, with a beneficial balance between preservation of stemness and cell expansion, thus allowing to obtain a significant amount of edited, primitive HSPCs compared to established, state-of-the-art culture conditions. Overall, the implantation of this optimized ex vivo HSPC culture protocol will improve the efficacy, feasibility and applicability of gene editing and will likely provide one step further to unlock the full therapeutic potential of such powerful technology.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSequencing long reads presents novel challenges to mapping. One such challenge is low sequence similarity between the reads and the reference, due to high sequencing error and mutation rates. This occurs, e.g., in a cancer tumor, or due to differences between strains of viruses or bacteria. A key idea in mapping algorithms is to sketch sequences with their minimizers. Recently, syncmers were introduced as an alternative sketching method that is more robust to mutations and sequencing errors.\n\nResultsWe introduce parameterized syncmer schemes, a generalization of syncmers, and provide a theoretical analysis for multi-parameter schemes. By combining these schemes with downsampling or minimizers we can achieve any desired compression and window guarantee. We implemented the use of parameterized syncmer schemes in the popular minimap2 and Winnowmap2 mappers. In tests on simulated and real long read data from a variety of genomes, the syncmer-based algorithms, with scheme parameters selected on the basis of the theoretical analysis, reduced unmapped reads by 20-60% at high compression while usually using less memory. The advantage was more pronounced at low sequence identity. At sequence identity of 75% and medium compression, syncmer-minimap had only 37% as many unmapped reads, and 8% fewer of the reads that did map were incorrectly mapped. Even at lower compression and error rates, parameterized syncmer based mapping mapped more reads than the original minimizer-based mappers as well as mappers using the original syncmer schemes. We conclude that using parameterized syncmer schemes can improve mapping of long reads in a wide range of settings.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/Shamir-Lab/syncmer_mapping\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/syncmer_mapping.\n\nAuthor summaryPopular long read mappers use minimizers, the minimal hashed k-mers from overlapping windows, as alignment seeds. Recent work showed that syncmers, which select a fixed set of k-mers as seeds, are more likely to be conserved under errors or mutations than minimizers, making them potentially useful for mapping error-prone long reads. We introduce a framework for creating syncmers, that we call parameterized syncmer schemes, which generalize those introduced so far, and provide a theoretical analysis of their properties. We implemented parameterized syncmer schemes in the minimap2 and Winnowmap2 long read mappers. Using parameters selected on the basis of our theoretical analysis we demonstrate improved mapping performance, with fewer unmapped and incorrectly mapped reads on a variety of simulated and real datasets. The improvements are consistent across a broad range of compression rates and sequence identities, with the most significant improvements for lower sequence identity (high error or mutation rates) and high compression.",

However, it remains difficult to precisely align spatial observations across slices, samples, scales, individuals, and technologies. Here, we propose a probabilistic model that aligns a set of spatially-resolved genomics and histology slices onto a known or unknown common coordinate system into which the samples are aligned both spatially and in terms of the phenotypic readouts (e.g., gene or protein expression levels, cell density, open chromatin regions). Our method consists of a two-layer Gaussian process: the first layer maps the observed samples spatial locations into a common coordinate system, and the second layer maps from the common coordinate system to the observed readouts. Our approach also allows for slices to be mapped to a known template coordinate space if one exists. We show that our registration approach enables complex downstream spatially-aware analyses of spatial genomics data at multiple resolutions that are impossible or inaccurate with unaligned data, including an analysis of variance, differential expression across the z-axis, and association tests across multiple data modalities.",

    "abstract": "Cancer driver mutations often display mutual exclusion or co-occurrence, underscoring the key role of epistasis in carcinogenesis. However, estimating the magnitude of epistasis and quantifying its effect on tumor evolution remains a challenge. We developed a method to quantify COnditional SELection on the Excess of Nonsynonymous Substitutions (Coselens) in cancer genes. Coselens infers the number of drivers per gene in different partitions of a cancer genomics dataset using covariance-based mutation models and determines whether coding mutations in a gene affect selection for drivers in any other gene. Using Coselens, we identified 296 conditionally selected gene pairs across 16 cancer types in the TCGA dataset. Conditional selection affects 25-50% of driver substitutions in tumors with >2 drivers. Conditionally co-selected genes form modular networks, whose structures challenge the traditional interpretation of within-pathway mutual exclusivity and across-pathway synergy, suggesting a more complex scenario, where gene-specific across-pathway epistasis shapes differentiated cancer subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica Typhimurium is a serious pathogen that is involved in human nontyphoidal infections. Tackling Typhimurium infections is difficult due to the species dynamic adaptation to its environment, which is dictated by a complex transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). While traditional biomolecular methods provide characterizations of specific regulators, it is laborious to construct the global TRN structure from this bottom-up approach. Here, we used a machine learning technique to understand the transcriptional signatures of S. enterica Typhimurium from the top down, as a whole and in individual strains. Furthermore, we conducted cross-strain comparison of 6 strains in serovar Typhimurium to investigate similarities and differences in their TRNs with pan-genomic analysis. By decomposing all the publicly available RNA-Seq data of Typhimurium with independent component analysis (ICA), we obtained over 400 independently modulated sets of genes, called iModulons. Through analysis of these iModulons, we 1) discover three transport iModulons linked to antibiotic resistance, 2) describe concerted responses to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs), 3) uncover evidence towards new regulons, and 4) identify two iModulons linked to bile responses in strain ST4/74. We extend this analysis across the pan-genome to show that strain-specific iModulons 5) reveal different genetic signatures in pathogenicity islands that explain phenotypes and 6) capture the activity of different phages in the studied strains. Using all high-quality publicly-available RNA-Seq data to date, we present a comprehensive, data-driven Typhimurium TRN. It is conceivable that with more high-quality datasets from more strains, the approach used in this study will continue to guide our investigation in understanding the pan-transcriptome of Typhimurium. Interactive dashboards for all gene modules in this project are available at https://imodulondb.org/ under the \"Salmonella Typhimurium\" page to enable browsing for interested researchers.",

    "abstract": "Neural system identification aims at learning the response function of neurons to arbitrary stimuli using experimentally recorded data, but typically does not leverage normative principles such as efficient coding of natural environments. Visual systems, however, have evolved to efficiently process input from the natural environment. Here, we present a normative network regularization for system identification models by incorporating, as a regularizer, the efficient coding hypothesis, which states that neural response properties of sensory representations are strongly shaped by the need to preserve most of the stimulus information with limited resources. Using this approach, we explored if a system identification model can be improved by sharing its convolutional filters with those of an autoencoder which aims to efficiently encode natural stimuli. To this end, we built a hybrid model to predict the responses of retinal neurons to noise stimuli. This approach did not only yield a higher performance than the \"stand-alone\" system identification model, it also produced more biologically-plausible filters. We found these results to be consistent for retinal responses to different stimuli and across model architectures. Moreover, our normatively regularized model performed particularly well in predicting responses of direction-of-motion sensitive retinal neurons. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that efficiently encoding environmental inputs can improve system identification models of early visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene. Because the ATXN3 protein regulates photoreceptor ciliogenesis and phagocytosis, we aimed to explore whether expanded polyQ ATXN3 impacts retinal function and integrity in SCA3 patients and transgenic mice.\n\nWe evaluated the retinal structure and function in five patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and in a transgenic mouse model of this disease (YACMJD84.2, Q84) using, respectively, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinogram (ERG). We further determined in the transgenic mice: a) the retinal expression pattern of ATXN3 and assessed the distribution of cones and rods by immunofluorescence (IF); and b) the retinal ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\n\nSome patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 in our cohort revealed: i) reduced central macular thickness indirectly correlated with disease duration; ii) decreased thickness of the macula and the ganglion cell layer, and reduced macula volume inversely correlated with disease severity (SARA score); and iii) electrophysiological dysfunction of cones, rods, and inner retinal cells. Transgenic mice replicated the human OCT and ERG findings with aged homozygous Q84/Q84 mice showing a stronger phenotype accompanied by further thinning of the outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor layer and highly reduced cone and rod activities, thus supporting severe retinal dysfunction in these mice. In addition, Q84 mice showed progressive accumulation of ATXN3-positive aggregates throughout several retinal layers and depletion of cones alongside the disease course. TEM analysis of aged Q84/Q84 mouse retinas supported the IF ATXN3 aggregation findings by revealing the presence of high number of negative electron dense puncta in ganglion cells, inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers, and further showed thinning of the outer plexiform layer, thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium and elongation of apical microvilli.\n\nOur results indicate that retinal alterations detected by non-invasive eye examination using OCT and ERG could represent a biological marker of disease progression and severity in patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.",

    "abstract": "The complement system has been heavily implicated in severe COVID-19 with clinical studies revealing widespread gene induction, deposition, and activation. However, the mechanism by which complement is activated in this disease remains incompletely understood. Herein we examined the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and complement by inoculating the virus in lepirudin-anticoagulated human blood. This caused progressive C5a production after 30 minutes and 24 hours, which was blocked entirely by inhibitors for factor B, C3, C5, and heparan sulfate. However, this phenomenon could not be replicated in cell-free plasma, highlighting the requirement for cell surface deposition of complement and interactions with heparan sulfate. Additional functional analysis revealed that complement-dependent granulocyte and monocyte activation was delayed. Indeed, C5aR1 internalisation and CD11b upregulation on these cells only occurred after 24 hours. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is a non-canonical complement activator that triggers the alternative pathway through interactions with heparan sulfate.",

    "abstract": "In response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, macrophages mount early proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses similar to those observed in M1 macrophages classically activated by LPS and IFN-{gamma}. A metabolic reprogramming to HIF-1-mediated uptake of glucose and its metabolism by glycolysis is required for M1-like polarization, but little is known about other metabolic programs driving M1-like polarization during M. tuberculosis infection. Identification and quantification of labeling patterns of U13C glutamine and U13C glucose-derived metabolites demonstrated that glutamine, rather than glucose, is catabolized in both the oxidative and reductive TCA cycle of M1-like macrophages, thereby generating signaling molecules that include succinate, biosynthetic precursors such as aspartate, and the antimicrobial metabolite itaconate. This conclusion is corroborated by diminished M1 polarization via chemical inhibition of glutaminase (GLS), the key enzyme of the glutaminolysis pathway, and by genetic deletion of GLS in infected macrophages. Furthermore, characterization of the labeling distribution pattern of U15N glutamine in M1-like macrophages indicates that glutamine serves as a nitrogen source for the synthesis of intermediates of purine and pyrimidine metabolism plus amino acids including aspartate. Thus, the catabolism of glutamine, as an integral component of metabolic reprogramming in activating macrophages, fulfills the cellular demand for bioenergetic and biosynthetic precursors of M1-like macrophages. Knowledge of these new immunometabolic features of M1-like macrophages is expected to advance the development of host-directed therapies that will enhance bacterial clearance and prevent immunopathology during tuberculosis.\n\nSummaryRecent advances in immunometabolism have stimulated increasing interest in understanding the specific cellular metabolic states of immune cells associated with the various disease states of tuberculosis. As the primary target of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, macrophages play essential roles in dictating the progression and final outcome of infection. Previous studies, including our own, show that the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible-factor 1 alpha (HIF-1) and a metabolic reprogramming to the Warburg effect-like state are general features of the host immune cell response to Mtb infection. They are also critical for macrophage polarization to the M1-like phenotype characterized by high-level expression of proinflammatory and antimicrobial molecules against Mtb infection. However, our knowledge about the immunometabolic features of M1-like macrophages is poor. Using widely targeted small metabolite (WTSM) screening (600+ small polar metabolites) and stable isotope tracing of U13 glutamine, U13 glucose, and N15 glutamine, as well as therapeutic and genetic approaches, we report that, in addition to elevated glucose catabolism by glycolysis, glutamine serves as an important carbon and nitrogen source for the generation of building blocks, signaling molecules, and antimicrobial metabolite during macrophage polarization to the M1-like phenotype. The study adds novel insights into the immunometabolic properties of Mtb-infected macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes show high IFN responses, and contribute to both protective and pathogenic functions following influenza virus infection. In order to understand the significance of IFN responses in this subset, we examined monocytes during infection with a lethal H5N1 virus that induces high levels of IFN and a low-pathogenicity H1N1 virus that induces low levels of IFN. We show that H5N1 infection results in early recruitment of high numbers of Ly6Chi monocytes and induction of chemokines and Ifnb1. Using unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we also find that monocytes are significantly enriched during H5N1 infection and are associated with chemokine and IFN signatures in mice, and with severity of symptoms after influenza virus infection in humans. Recruited Ly6Chi monocytes subsequently become infected in the lung, produce IFN-{beta}, and mature into FasL+ monocyte-derived cells (FasL+MCs) expressing dendritic cell markers. Both Ccr2-/- and Faslgld mice are protected from lethal infection, indicating that monocytes contribute to pathogenesis. Global loss of type I and type III IFN signaling in Stat2-/- mice results in loss of monocyte recruitment, likely reflecting a requirement for IFN-dependent chemokine induction. Here we show that IFN is not directly required for monocyte recruitment on an IFN-sufficient background, but is required for maturation to FasL+MCs. Loss of IFN signaling skews to a Ly6Clo phenotype associated with tissue repair, suggesting that IFN signaling in monocytes is a critical determinant of influenza virus pathogenesis.",

However, coiled coils lack features typical of protein-protein interaction sites, and it is therefore challenging to understand how M proteins achieve specific binding, for example, with the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, leading to its neutralization. The crystal structure of a complex of LL-37 with M87 protein, an antigenic M protein variant from a strain that is an emerging threat, revealed a novel interaction mode. The M87 coiled coil unfurled and asymmetrically exposed its hydrophobic core to capture LL-37. A single LL-37 molecule bound M87 in the crystal, but in solution recruited additional LL-37 molecules, consistent with a  protein trap neutralization mechanism. The interaction mode visualized crystallographically was verified to contribute significantly to LL-37 resistance in an M87 Strep A strain, and was identified to be conserved in a number of other M protein types that are prevalent in human populations. Our results provide specific detail for therapeutic inhibition of LL-37 neutralization by M proteins.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread occurrence of crystalline inclusions in unicellular eukaryotes, scant attention has been paid to their composition, functions, and evolutionary origins, assuming just their inorganic contents. The advent of Raman microscopy, still scarcely used for biological samples, allowed chemical characterization of cellular inclusions in vivo. Using this method, herein we provide a substantial revision of the cellular crystalline inclusions across the broad diversity of eukaryotes examining all major supergroups. Surprisingly, here we show that 80 % of these crystalline inclusions contain purines, mostly anhydrous guanine (62 %), guanine monohydrate (2 %), uric acid (12 %) and xanthine (4 %). Hence, our findings indicate that purine biocrystallization is a very general and an ancestral eukaryotic process operating by an as-yet-unknown mechanism. Purine crystalline inclusions are high-capacity and rapid-turnover reserves of nitrogen of a great metabolic importance, as well as optically active elements, e.g., present in the light sensing eyespots of flagellates, possessing even more hypothetical functions. Thus, we anticipate our work to be a starting point for more in-depth studies of this phenomenon on the detailed level spanning from cell biology to global ecology, with further potential applications in biotechnologies, bio-optics or in human medicine.",

    "abstract": "The initiation of a spatially and temporally limited inflammation is essential for tissue and bone remodeling by the periodontal ligament (PdL) located between teeth and alveolar bone. Obesity-associated hyperlipidemic changes may impair PdL fibroblast (PdLF) functions, disturbing their inflammatory response to mechanical stress such as those occurring during orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). Recently, we reported an attenuated pro-inflammatory response of human PdLF (HPdLF) to compressive forces when stimulated with monounsaturated oleic acid (OA). Fatty acids, including OA, could serve as alternative source of acetyl-CoA, thereby affecting epigenetic histone marks such as histone 3 lysine acetylation (H3Kac) in a lipid metabolism-dependent manner. In this study, we therefore aimed to investigate the extent to which OA exerts its anti -inflammatory effect via changes in H3Kac. Six-hour compressed HPdLF showed increased H3Kac when cultured with OA. Inhibition of histone deacetylases resulted in a comparable IL10 increase as observed in compressed OA cultures. In contrast, inhibition of histone acetyltransferases, particularly p300/CBP, in compressed HPdLF exposed to OA led to an inflammatory response comparable to compressed control cells. OA-dependent increased association of H3Kac to IL10 promoter regions in force-stressed HPdLF further strengthened the assumption that OA exhibits its anti-inflammatory properties via modulation of this epigenetic mark. In conclusion, our study strongly suggests that obesity-related hyperlipidemia affect the functions of PdL cells via alterations in their epigenetic code. Since epigenetic inhibitors are already widely used clinically, they may hold promise for novel approaches to limit obesity-related risks during OTM.",

Unusually, it adopts the typical fold of canonical ABC exporters. Here, we report the structure of unliganded Mtb IrtAB and its structure in complex with ATP, ADP, and an ATP analogue (AMP-PNP) at resolutions from 2.9 to 3.5 [A]. In the ATP-bound state, the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a \"head-to-tail\" dimer, but IrtAB has an unexpectedly occluded conformation, with the inner core forming a large hydrophilic cavity of about 4600 [A]3. Comparison of the structure of the transporter in inward-facing and occluded conformations reveals that the NBD and the intracellular helical region of transmembrane domain (TMD) have an asymmetric allosteric mechanism when ATP binding/hydrolysis such that the one exhibits rigid-body rotation and the other moves in a concerted response as a rigid body. This study provides a molecular basis for the ATP-driven conformational changes that occur in IrtAB and an explanation as to how iron-loaded siderophores are imported into Mtb by IrtAB.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative nucleic acid amplification tests (qNAATs) are critical in treating infectious diseases, such as in HIV viral load monitoring or SARS-CoV-2 testing, in which viral load indicates viral suppression or infectivity. Quantitative PCR is the gold standard tool for qNAATs; however, there is a need to develop point-of-care (POC) qNAATs to manage infectious diseases in outpatient clinics, low- and middle-income countries, and the home. Isothermal amplification methods are an emerging tool for POC NAATs as an alternative to traditional PCR-based workflows. Previous works have focused on relating isothermal amplification bulk fluorescence signals to input copies of target nucleic acids for sample quantification with limited success. In this work, we show that recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) reactions on paper membranes exhibit discrete fluorescent amplification nucleation sites. We demonstrate that the number of nucleation sites can be used to quantify HIV-1 DNA and RNA in less than 20 minutes. An image-analysis algorithm quantifies nucleation sites and determines the input nucleic acid copies in the range of 67-3,000 copies per reaction. We demonstrate a mobile phone-based system for image capture and onboard processing, illustrating that this method may be used at the point-of-care for qNAATs with minimal instrumentation.",

    "abstract": "Fundamental aspects of DNA replication, such as the anatomy of replication stall sites, how replisomes are influenced by gene transcription and whether the progression of sister replisomes is coordinated are poorly understood. Available techniques do not allow the precise mapping of the positions of individual replisomes on chromatin. We have developed a new method called Replicon-seq that entails the excision of full-length replicons by controlled nuclease cleavage at replication forks. Replicons are sequenced using Nanopore, which provides a single molecule readout of long DNA molecules. Using Replicon-seq, we have investigated replisome movement along chromatin. We found that sister replisomes progress with remarkable consistency from the origin of replication but function autonomously. Replication forks that encounter obstacles pause for a short duration but rapidly resume synthesis. The helicase Rrm3 plays a critical role both in mitigating the effect of protein barriers and facilitating efficient termination. Replicon-seq provides an unprecedented means of defining replisome movement across the genome.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of Human and Animal African trypanosomiasis, cycles between a mammalian host and a tsetse fly vector. The parasite undergoes huge changes in morphology and metabolism as it adapts to each host environment. These changes are reflected in the differing transcriptomes of parasites living in each host. While changes in the transcriptome have been well catalogued for parasites differentiating from the mammalian bloodstream to the insect stage, it remains unclear whether chromatin interacting proteins mediate transcriptomic changes during life cycle adaptation. We and others have shown that chromatin interacting bromodomain proteins localize to transcription start sites in bloodstream parasites, but whether the localization of bromodomain proteins changes as parasites differentiate from bloodstream to insect stage parasites remains unknown. To address this question, we performed Cleavage Under Target and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) timecourse experiments using a tagged version of Bromodomain Protein 3 (Bdf3) in parasites differentiating from bloodstream to insect stage forms. We found that Bdf3 occupancy at most loci increased at 3 hours following onset of differentiation and decreased thereafter. A number of sites with increased bromodomain protein occupancy lie proximal to genes known to have altered transcript levels during differentiation, such as procyclins, procyclin associated genes, and invariant surface glycoproteins. While most Bdf3 occupied sites are observed throughout differentiation, a very small number appear de novo as differentiation progresses. Notably, one such site lies proximal to the procyclin gene locus, which contains genes essential for remodeling surface proteins following transition to the insect stage. Overall, these studies indicate that occupancy of chromatin interacting proteins is dynamic during life cycle stage transitions, and provides the groundwork for future studies aimed at uncovering whether changes in bromodomain protein occupancy affect transcript levels of neighboring genes. Additionally, the optimization of CUT&RUN for use in Trypanosoma brucei may prove helpful for other researchers as an alternative to Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis (BX) are characterised by severe chronic infections. Fungal and bacterial components of infection are both recognized. Little however is known about how fungal and bacterial organisms interact and whether these interactions impact on disease outcomes.\n\nMethodsQuantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing of ITS2 and 16S rRNA gene was carried out on 107 patients with CF or BX with clinically defined fungal infection status for all patients. The relationship between fungal and bacterial community composition was extensively explored using: random forest modelling, correlation network analysis, multi-omics factor analysis, and sample-wise clustering, to understand associations both within and between the microbial communities and their relationship to respiratory disease.\n\nResultsRandom forest modelling demonstrated distinct fungal and bacterial communities within CF and BX patients. The inclusion of both kingdoms in the models did not improve discrimination between the two diseases. Within the CF patients, bacterial community composition was independent of clinical fungal disease status. Bacterial and fungal communities did not relate to the presence of CF pulmonary exacerbations (CFPE). Correlation network analysis found intra-kingdom interactions were predominant in the data. Multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) revealed latent factors corresponding to single kingdoms. Thus, in the bacterial community we identified two distinct clusters characterised by the presence or absence of Pseudomonas-domination. This was independent of fungal community which was characterised by a second set of independent clusters dominated by Saccharomycetes.\n\nConclusionsIn this study we were unable to detect clear evidence of clinically significant inter-kingdom interactions between the bacterial and fungal communities. While further work is required to fully understand microbial interaction within the lung, our data suggests that interkingdom interactions may not be the primary driver of patient outcomes, particularly in the context of fungal infection.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveBreast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous type of cancer that occurs as a result of distinct molecular alterations in breast tissue. Although there are many new developments in treatment and targeted therapy for BC in recent years, this cancer type is still the most common one among women with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, new research is still needed for biomarker detection.\n\nMethodsGSE101124 and GSE182471 datasets were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to evaluate differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) databases were used to identify the significantly dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes considering the Prediction Analysis of Microarray (PAM50) classification. The circRNA-miRNA-gene relationship was investigated using the Cancer Specific CircRNA (v2.0) (CSCD), miRDB, miRWalk and miRTarBase databases. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed by the STRING 2021 database and visualized by the Cytoscape tool (v3.9.0). Then, raw miRNA data and genes were filtered using some selection criteria according to a specific expression level in PAM50 subgroups. A bottleneck method was utilized to obtain highly interacted hub genes using cytoHubba Cytoscape plugin. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) analysis were performed for these hub genes, which are detected within the miRNA and circRNA axis in our study.\n\nResultsWe identified three circRNAs, three miRNAs, and eighteen candidate target genes that may play an important role in BC. In addition, it has been determined that these molecules can be useful in the classification of BC, especially in determining the basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) subtype.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that hsa_circ_0000515/ miR-486-5p/ SDC1 axis may be an important biomarker candidate in distinguishing patients in the BLBC group, especially according to the PAM50 classification of BC.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites secrete the contents of rhoptries into host cells to permit their invasion and establishment of an infectious niche. The rhoptry secretory apparatus (RSA), which is critical for rhoptry secretion, was recently discovered in Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium. It is positioned at the cell apex and associates with an enigmatic apical vesicle (AV), which docks one or two rhoptries at the site of exocytosis. The interplay among the rhoptries, the AV, and the parasite plasma membrane for secretion remains unclear. Moreover, it is unknown if a similar machinery exists in the deadly malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, we use in situ cryo-electron tomography to investigate the rhoptry secretion system in P. falciparum merozoites. We identify the presence of an RSA at the cell apex and a morphologically distinct AV docking the tips of the two rhoptries to the RSA. We also discover two new organizations: one in which the AV is absent with one of the two rhoptry tips docks directly to the RSA, and a second in which the two rhoptries fuse together and the common tip docks directly to the RSA. Interestingly, rhoptries among the three states show no significant difference in luminal volume and density, suggesting that the exocytosis of rhoptry contents has not yet occurred, and that these different organizations likely represent sequential states leading to secretion. Using subtomogram averaging, we reveal different conformations of the RSA structure corresponding to each state, including the opening of a gate-like density in the rhoptry-fused state. These conformational changes of the RSA uncover structural details of a priming process for major rhoptry secretion, which likely occur after initial interaction with a red blood cell. Our results highlight a previously unknown step in the process of rhoptry secretion and indicate a regulatory role for the conserved apical vesicle in host invasion by apicomplexan parasites.",

    "abstract": "Indoor surfaces are paradoxically presumed to be both colonized by pathogens, necessitating disinfection, and \"microbial wastelands.\" In these resource-poor, dry environments, competition and decay are thought to be important drivers of microbial community composition. However, the relative contributions of these two processes have not been specifically evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, we used microcosms to specifically evaluate whether interspecies interactions occur on surfaces. We combined transcriptomics and traditional microbiology techniques to investigate whether competition occurred between two clinically important pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and a probiotic cleaner containing a consortium of Bacillus species. Probiotic cleaning seeks to take advantage of ecological principles such as competitive exclusion, thus using benign microorganisms to inhibit viable pathogens, but there is limited evidence that competitive exclusion in fact occurs in environments of interest (i.e., indoor surfaces). Our results indicate that competition in this setting has a negligible impact on community composition but may influence the functions expressed by active organisms. Although Bacillus spp. remained viable on surfaces for an extended period of time after application, viable colony forming units (CFUs) of A. baumannii recovered following exposure to a chemical-based detergent with and without Bacillus spp. showed no statistical difference. Similarly, for K. pneumoniae, there were small statistical differences in CFUs between cleaning scenarios with or without Bacillus spp. in the chemical-based detergent. The transcriptome of A. baumannii with and without Bacillus spp. exposure shared a high degree of similarity in overall gene expression, but the transcriptome of K. pneumoniae differed in overall gene expression, including reduced response in genes related to antimicrobial resistance. Together, these results highlight the need to fully understand the underlying biological and ecological mechanisms for community assembly and function on indoor surfaces, as well as having practical implications for cleaning and disinfection strategies for infection prevention.",

    "abstract": "Honey bees, the worlds most significant agricultural pollinator, have suffered dramatic losses in the last few decades (1,2). These losses are largely due to the synergistic effects of multiple stressors, the most pervasive of which is limited nutrition (3-5). The effects of poor nutrition are most damaging in the developing larvae of honey bees, who mature into workers unable to meet the needs of their colony (6-8). It is therefore essential that we better understand the nutritional landscape experienced by honey bee larvae. In this study, we characterize the metabolic capabilities of a honey bee larvae-associated bacterium, Bombella apis (formerly Parasaccharibacter apium), and its effects on the nutritional resilience of larvae. We found that B. apis is the only bacterium associated with larvae that can withstand the antimicrobial larval diet. Further, we found that B. apis can synthesize all essential amino acids and significantly alters the amino acid content of synthetic larval diet, largely by increasing the essential amino acid lysine. Analyses of gene gain/loss across the phylogeny suggest that two distinct cationic amino acid transporters were gained by B. apis ancestors, and the transporter LysE is conserved across all sequenced strains of B. apis. This result suggests that amino acid export is a key feature conserved within the Bombella clade. Finally, we tested the impact of B. apis on developing honey bee larvae subjected to nutritional stress and found that larvae supplemented with B. apis are bolstered against mass reduction despite limited nutrition. Together, these data suggest an important role of B. apis as a nutritional mutualist of honey bee larvae.",

    "abstract": "Double strand break repair during meiosis is normally achieved using the homologous chromosome as a repair template. Heteromorphic sex chromosomes have reduced sequence homology with one another, presenting unique challenges to the repair of double strand breaks. Our understanding of how heteromorphic sex chromosomes behave during meiosis has been largely limited to the ancient sex chromosomes of mammals, where the X and Y differ markedly in overall structure and gene content. Consequently, pairing of the X and Y chromosomes is limited to a small pseudoautosomal region. It remains unclear how more recently evolved sex chromosomes, that share considerably more sequence homology with one another, pair and repair double strand breaks during meiosis. One possibility is barriers to pairing evolve rapidly. Alternatively, recently evolved sex chromosomes may exhibit pairing and double strand break repair that more closely resembles that of their autosomal ancestors. Here we use the recently evolved X and Y chromosomes of the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to study patterns of pairing and double stranded break formation using molecular cytogenetics. We found that the sex chromosomes of threespine stickleback fish do not pair exclusively in the pseudoautosomal region. Instead, the chromosomes fully pair in a non-homologous fashion. To achieve this, the X chromosome underwent synaptic adjustment during pachytene to match the axis length of the Y chromosome. Double strand break formation and repair rate also matched that of the autosomes. Our results highlight that recently evolved sex chromosomes exhibit meiotic behavior that is reminiscent of autosomes and argues for further work to identify the homologous templates that are used to repair double strand breaks on the X and Y chromosomes.",

The comprehension of physiological processes of organisms at different levels of organizations is essential to explore and predict nutrient recycling behavior in different scenarios, and to design integrated productive systems that efficiently use the nutrient inputs through an adjusted mass balance. We fed with fish-feed three species of decapods from different families and with aquacultural potential to explore the animal-mediated nutrient dynamic and its applicability in productive systems. We tested whether physiological (body mass, body elemental content), ecological (diet), taxonomic and experimental (time of incubation) variables predicts N and P excretion rates and ratios across and within taxa. We also analysed body mass and body elemental content independently as predictors of N and P excretion of decapods across, among and within taxa. Finally, we verified if body content scales allometrically across and within taxa and if differed among taxa. Body mass and taxonomic identity predicted nutrient excretion rates both across and within taxa. When physiological variables were analysed independently, body size best predicted nutrient mineralization in both scales of analyses. Regarding body elemental content, only body P content scaled negatively with body mass across taxa. Results showed higher N-requirements and lower C:N of prawns than anomurans and crabs. The role of crustaceans as nutrient recyclers depends mainly on the species and body mass, and should be considered to select complementary species that efficiently use feed resources. Prawns need more protein in their feed and might be integrated with fish of higher N-requirements, while crabs and anomurans, with fish of lower N-requirements. Our study contributed to the background of MTE and EST through empirical data obtained from decapods and provided useful information to achieve more efficient aquaculture integration systems.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus cereus is a food contaminant with widely varying enterotoxic potential of its virulence proteins. In this article, phylogenetic analysis of the whole-genome amino acid sequences of 41 strains, evolutionary distance calculation of the amino acid sequences of the virulence genes, and functional and structural prediction of the virulence proteins were performed to reveal the taxonomically diverse distribution of virulence factors. The genome evolution of the strains showed a clustering trend based on the coding virulence genes. The strains of B. cereus have evolved into non-toxic risk and toxic risk clusters with medium-high- and medium-low-risk clusters. The distances of evolutionary transfer relative to housekeeping genes of incomplete virulence genes were greater than those of complete virulence genes, and the distance values of HblACD were higher than those of nheABC and CytK among the complete virulence genes. Cytoplasmic localization was impossible for all the virulence proteins, and NheB, NheC, Hbl-B, and Hbl-L1 were extracellular according to predictive analysis. Nhe and Hbl proteins except CytK had similar spatial structures. The predicted structures of Nhe and Hbl mainly showed  head and  tail domains. The  head of NheA and Hbl-B, including two -helices separated by {beta}-tongue strands, might play a special role in Nhe trimers and Hbl trimers, respectively. The  cap of CytK, which includes two  latches with many {beta}-sheets, formed a {beta}-barrel structure with pores, and a  rim balanced the structure. The evolution of B. cereus strains showed a clustering tendency based on the coding virulence genes, and the complete virulence-gene operon combination had higher relative genetic stability. The beta-tongue or latch associated with {beta}-sheet folding might play an important role in the binding of virulence structures and pore-forming toxins in B. cereus.",

    "abstract": "Forward masking was investigated by the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) method in a bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus using stimulation by two successive acoustic pulses (the masker and test) projected from spatially separated sources. The positions of the two sound sources either coincided with or were symmetrical relative to the head axis at azimuths from 0 to {+/-}90{degrees}. AEPs were recorded either from the vertex or from the lateral head surface next to the auditory meatus. In the last case, the test source was ipsilateral to the recording side, whereas the masker source was either ipsi- or contralateral. For lateral recording, AEP release from masking (recovery) was slower for the ipsi-than for the contralateral masker source position. For vertex recording, AEP recovery was equal both for the coinciding positions of the masker and test sources and for their symmetrical positions relative to the head axis. The data indicate that at higher levels of the auditory system of the-dolphin, binaural convergence makes the forward masking nearly equal for ipsi- and contralateral positions of the masker and test.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Even though successful transplantation of dopamine-producing cells into the striatum exhibits favourable effects in animal models and clinical trials; transplanted cell survival is low. Since every transplant elicits an inflammatory response which can affect cell survival and differentiation, we aimed to study in vivo and in vitro the impact of the pro-inflammatory environment on human dopaminergic precursors. We first observed that transplanted human dopaminergic precursors into the striatum of immunosuppressed rats elicited an early and sustained activation of astroglial and microglial cells after 15 days post-transplant. This long-lasting response was associated with Tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in microglial cells. In vitro conditioned media from activated BV2 microglial cells increased cell death, decreased Tyrosine hydroxylase -positive cells and induced morphological alterations on human neural stem cells-derived dopaminergic precursors at two differentiation stages: 19 days and 28 days. Those effects were ameliorated by inhibition of Tumor necrosis factor alpha, a cytokine which was previously detected in vivo and in conditioned media from activated BV-2 cells. Our results suggest that a pro-inflammatory environment is sustained after transplantation under immunosuppression, providing a window of opportunity to modify this response to increase transplant survival and differentiation. In addition, our data show that the microglia-derived pro-inflammatory microenvironment has a negative impact on survival and differentiation of dopaminergic precursors. Finally, Tumor necrosis factor alpha plays a key role in these effects, suggesting that this cytokine could be an interesting target to increase the efficacy of human dopaminergic precursors transplantation in Parkinsons Disease.",

    "abstract": "Herein we describe a previously uninvestigated salivary gland escape barrier (SEB) in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes infected with two different strains of Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV). The WEEV strains were originally isolated either from mosquitoes (IMP181) or a human patient (McMillan). Both IMP181 and McMillan viruses were fully able to infect the salivary glands of Culex tarsalis after intrathoracic injection as determined by expression of mCherry fluorescent protein. IMP181, however, was better adapted to transmission as measured by virus titer in saliva as well as transmission rates in infected mosquitoes. We used chimeric recombinant WEEV strains to show that inclusion of IMP181-derived structural genes partially circumvents the SEB.\n\nAuthor StatementDuring the first half of the previous century, WEEV was responsible for large outbreaks throughout the northern United States and Canada that caused severe disease in horses and people. Over the past 60 years, cases of WEEV have mysteriously faded and the pathogen is rarely encountered in the clinic today. Salivary gland escape barriers (SEB) are a relatively neglected field of study in arbovirology, and this study provides a valuable contribution to the field by describing a SEB found in otherwise vector competent Culex tarsalis mosquitoes. Although midgut barriers are well studied, less is known about barriers to transmission in the salivary glands. Although salivary gland infection occurs at a high rate following direct injection of virus into the hemocoel, we noticed that only [~]20-30% of infected mosquitoes transmit detectable infectious virus in their saliva. Additionally, although the more pathogenic patient-derived McMillan strain of WEEV infected salivary glands at a similar rate, its transmission was more severely restricted than the mosquito-derived but less pathogenic Imperial 181 strain. We were able to trace determinants of viral transmission to the 6K/E1 region of the gene encoding the viral structural polyprotein. WEEV is a valuable research model for the closely related Eastern equine encephalitis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus we believe that our findings are applicable to other members of Togaviridae.",

    "abstract": "The complete halt in the synthesis of new effective antimicrobial compounds is a global concern. Pathogenic microorganisms virulence mechanisms seem to have a significant impact on their pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity of the ethanol and methanol fractions of Pechuel-Loeschea leubnitziae leaf extract, as well as its effect on the expression level of virulence-associated genes.\n\nThe extracts fractions were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae (clinical), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans ATCC 90029. The test organisms antibiogram pattern was determined. The extracts attenuation effect on the target genes of the susceptible organisms was investigated employing relative quantification using RT-qPCR. The test organisms antibiogram pattern revealed that it was drug-resistant, intermediate, and sensitive. The extracts tested positive for antimicrobial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans ATCC 90029, with zones of inhibition varying from 20.33 to 29 mm. The lowest recorded MIC value was 4.688 mg/ml, while the highest was 37.5 mg/ml. In contrast to the methanol extract, the ethanol extract had a cidal action at a lower dose. The ethanol extracts Sub-MIC (18.25 mg/ml) merely reduced the expression of the hly gene in MRSA. The MRSA virulence genes were not suppressed by the sub-MIC of methanol extract (18.25 mg/ml). Notably, the expression of als1, pbl1, and sap1 in Candida albicans ATCC 90029 was significantly attenuated when exposed to sub-MICs of ethanol extract (2,344 mg/ml) and methanol extract (9.375 mg/ml). Per the findings of this research, the leaves of P. leubnitziae could be a source of an effective antimicrobial agent in the therapy of MRSA/Candida-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Ixodes ricinus, the most common species of tick in Europe, is known to transmit major pathogens to animals and humans such as Babesia spp. or Borrelia spp.. Its abundance and distribution have been steadily increasing in Europe during recent decades, due to global environmental changes. Indeed, as ticks spend most of their life in the environment, their activity and life cycle are highly dependent on environmental conditions, and therefore on climate or habitat changes. Simultaneously, wild ungulates have expanded their range and increased dramatically in abundance worldwide, in particular roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), have allowed tick populations to grow and spread. Currently, tick infestation on newborn wild ungulates is poorly documented. However, newborn ungulates are considered more sensitive to tick bites and pathogen transmission because of their immature immune system. Thus, improving knowledge about the factors influencing tick infestation on newborns is essential to better understand their health risks. This study was conducted at Trois-Fontaines forest, Champagne-Ardenne, France (1992-2018). Based on a long-term monitoring of roe deer fawns, we used a novel Bayesian model of the infestation of fawns to identify which biotic or abiotic factors are likely to modify the level of infestation by ticks of 965 fawns over time. We show that tick burden increased faster during the first days of life of the fawns and became constant when fawns were 5 days old and more, which could be explained by the depletion of questing ticks or the turnover of ticks feeding on fawns. Moreover, the humidity, which favors tick activity, was weakly positively related to the tick burden. Our results demonstrate that tick infestation was highly variable among years, particularly between 2000 and 2009. We hypothesize that this results from a modification of habitat caused by hurricane Lothar.",

    "abstract": "The success achieved in reducing malaria transmission by vector control is threatened by insecticide resistance. To strengthen the current vector control programmes, the non-genetic factors underlying the emergence of insecticide resistance in Anopheles vectors and its widespread need to be explored. This study aimed to assess the effects of larval diet on some life-history traits and pyrethroid-insecticide susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae s.s.\n\nThree (3) An. gambiae strains, namely Kisumu (insecticide susceptible), AcerKis (homozygous ace-1RG119S resistant) and KisKdr (homozygous kdrRL1014F resistant) were fed with three different diets (low, medium, and high) of TetraMin(R) Baby fish food. Pre-imaginal developmental time, larval mortality, adult emergence rate and female wing length were measured. Mosquito females were exposed to insecticide-treated net (ITN) PermaNet 2.0 and PermaNet 3.0.\n\nIn the three An. gambiae strains, significant differences in adult emergence rates (F = 1054.2; df = 2; p <0.01), mosquito wing length (F = 970.5; df = 2; p <0.01) and adult survival post insecticide exposure ({chi}2= 173; df = 2; p <0.01), were noticed among the three larval diets. Larvae fed with the low food diets took more time to develop, were smaller at emergence and displayed a short lifespan, while the specimens fed with a high regime developed faster and into big adults. Although being fed with a high diet, none of An. gambiae strain harbouring the kdrR and ace-1R allele survived 24 hours after exposure against PermaNet 3.0.\n\nThis study showed that variation in the larval diet significantly impacts An. gambiae life-history traits such as larval mortality and developmental time, adult wing length, and female susceptibility to pyrethroid insecticides. Further investigations through field-based studies would allow an in-depth understanding of the implications of these non-genetic parameters on the physiological traits of malaria vectors and consequently improve resistance management.",
