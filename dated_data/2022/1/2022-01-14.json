    "abstract": "Within-host spread of pathogens is an important process for the study of plant-pathogen interactions. However, the development of plant-pathogen lesions remains practically difficult to characterize beyond the common traits such as lesion area. Here, we address this question by combining image-based phenotyping with mathematical modelling.\n\nWe consider the spread of Peyronellaea pinodes on pea stipules that were monitored daily with visible imaging. We assume that pathogen propagation on host-tissues can be described by the Fisher-KPP model where lesion spread depends on both a logistic growth and an homogeneous diffusion. Model parameters are estimated using a variational data assimilation approach on sets of registered images.\n\nThis modelling framework is used to compare the spread of an aggressive isolate on two pea cultivars with contrasted levels of partial resistance. We show that the expected slower spread on the most resistant cultivar is actually due to a decrease of diffusion and, to a lesser extent, growth rate.\n\nThese results demonstrate that spatial models with imaging allows one to disentangle the processes involved in host-pathogen interactions. Hence, promoting model-based phenotyping of interactions would allow a better identification of quantitative traits thereafter used in genetics and ecological studies.",

    "abstract": "Climate-driven advances in spring can result in phenological mismatch between brood rearing and prey availability and consequently cause decreased productivity in birds. How consequences of mismatch vary across species ranges, and how individual behavior can mitigate mismatch effects is less studied. We quantified the relationship between phenological mismatch, productivity, and behavioral adaptations of American kestrels (Falco sparverius) across their breeding range in the United States and southern Canada. We obtained phenology and productivity data using nest observations from long term nest box monitoring, remote trail cameras, and community-scientist based programs. We collected data on parental incubation behavior and hatch asynchrony using trail cameras in nest boxes. Kestrels that laid eggs after the start of spring had higher rates of nest failure and fewer nestlings than earlier nesters, and effects of mismatch on productivity were most severe in the Northeast. In contrast, kestrels in the Southwest experienced a more gradual decline in productivity with seasonal mismatch. We attribute the effect of location to the growing season and temporal nesting windows (duration of nesting season). Specifically, resource availability in the Northeast is narrow and highly peaked during the breeding season, potentially resulting in shorter nesting windows. Conversely, resource curves may be more prolonged and dampened in the Southwest, and growing seasons are becoming longer with climate change, potentially resulting in longer nesting windows. We found that the onset of male incubation was negatively associated with lay date. Males from breeding pairs that laid eggs after the start of spring began incubation sooner than males from breeding pairs that laid before the start of spring. Early-onset male incubation was positively associated with hatching asynchrony, creating increased age variation in developing young. In sum, we demonstrate that American kestrels are vulnerable to phenological mismatch, and that this vulnerability varies across space. Northeastern populations could be more vulnerable to mismatch consequences, which may be one factor contributing to declines of kestrels in this region. Also, we demonstrate early onset of incubation as a potential adaptive behavior to advance average hatch date and spread out offspring demands, but it is unknown how impactful this will be in mitigating the fitness consequences of phenology mismatch.\n\nHighlightsClimate-driven phenological mismatch is a growing conservation concern.\n\nWe studied phenology and productivity of an avian predator across North America.\n\nAmerican kestrels nesting after the start of spring had lower productivity.\n\nLater nesting kestrels altered incubation to create hatching asynchrony.\n\nMismatch effects were strongest in the Northeast and may contribute to population declines.",

    "abstract": "In a rapidly urbanizing region such as West Africa, Aedes mosquitoes pose an emerging threat of infectious disease that is compounded by limited vector surveillance. Citizen science has been proposed as a way to fill surveillance gaps by training local residents to collect and share information on disease vectors. Increasing citizen science efforts can begin to bridge the gaps in our current knowledge of Aedes distribution while engaging locals with mosquito control and public health efforts. Understanding the distribution of disease vectors in West Africa can inform researchers and public health officials on where to conduct disease surveillance and focus public health interventions. We aimed to compare citizen science data to published literature observations of Aedes mosquitoes and to quantify how incorporating citizen science changes our understanding of Aedes mosquito distribution in West Africa. We utilized citizen science data collected through NASAs GLOBE Observer mobile phone application and data from a previously published literature review on Aedes mosquito distribution to examine the contribution of citizen science to understanding the distribution of Ae. aegypti in West Africa using Maximum Entropy modeling. Combining citizen science and literature-derived observations improved the fit of the model compared to models created by each data source alone, but did not alleviate location bias within the models, likely due to lack of widespread observations. Understanding Ae. aegypti distribution will require greater investment in Aedes mosquito surveillance in the region, and citizen science should be utilized as a tool in this mission to increase the reach of surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Biotechnological processes development is challenging due to the sheer variety of process parameters. For efficient upstream development parallel cultivation systems have proven to reduce costs and associated timelines successfully, while offering excellent process control. However, the degree of automation of such small scale systems is comparably low and necessary sample analysis requires manual steps. Although the subsequent analysis can be performed in a high-throughput manner, the integration of analytic devices remains challenging. Especially, when cultivation and analysis laboratories are spatially separated. Mobile robots offer a potential solution, but the implementation in research laboratories is not widely adopted. Our approach demonstrates the integration of a small scale cultivation system into a liquid handling station for an automated sample procedure. The samples are transferred via a mobile robotic lab assistant and subsequently analysed by a high-throughput analyzer. The process data is stored in a centralized database. The mobile robotic workflow guarantees a flexible solution for device integration and facilitates automation. Restrictions regarding spatial separation of devices are circumvented, enabling a modular platform throughout different laboratories. The presented cultivation platform is evaluated based on industrial relevant E. coli BW25113 high cell density fed-batch cultivation. Here its suitability for accelerating bioprocess development is proven. The necessary magnesium addition for reaching high cell densities in mineral salt medium is automated via a feedback operation loop. The feedback operation loop demonstrates the possibility for advanced control options. This study sets the foundation for a fully integrated facility with different cultivation scales sharing the same data infrastructure, where the mobile robotic lab assistant physically connects the devices.",

    "abstract": "The progression of tumorigenesis starts with a few mutational and structural driver events in the cell. Various cohort-based computational tools exist to identify driver genes but require a large number of samples to produce reliable results. Many studies use different methods to identify driver mutations/genes from mutations that have no impact on tumour progression; however, a small fraction of patients show no mutational events in any known driver genes. Current unsupervised methods map somatic and expression data onto a network to identify the perturbation in the network. Our method is the first machine learning model to classify genes as tumour suppressor gene (TSG), oncogene (OG) or neutral, thus assigning the functional impact of the gene in the patient. In this study, we develop a multi-omic approach, PIVOT (Personalised Identification of driVer OGs and TSGs), to train on experimentally or computationally validated mutational and structural driver events. Given the lack of any gold standards for the identification of personalised driver genes, we label the data using four strategies and, based on classification metrics, show gene-based labelling strategies perform best. We build different models using SNV, RNA, and multi-omic features to be used based on the data available. Our models trained on multi-omic data improved predictions compared to mutation and expression data, achieving an accuracy [&ge;] 0.99 for BRCA, LUAD and COAD datasets. We show network and expression-based features contribute the most to PIVOT. Our predictions on BRCA, COAD and LUAD cancer types reveal commonly altered genes such as TP53, and PIK3CA, which are predicted drivers for multiple cancer types. Along with known driver genes, our models also identify new driver genes such as PRKCA, SOX9 and PSMD4. Our multi-omic model labels both CNV and mutations with a more considerable contribution by CNV alterations. While predicting labels for genes mutated in multiple samples, we also label rare driver events occurring in as few as one sample. We also identify genes with dual roles within the same cancer type. Overall, PIVOT labels personalised driver genes as TSGs and OGs and also identifies rare driver genes.\n\nPIVOT is available at https://github.com/RamanLab/PIVOT.",

Bistable stimuli give us a rare opportunity to study the neural mechanisms behind this process. Such stimuli can be visually interpreted as simple or as more complex on the basis of the same sensory input. Previous studies demonstrated increased activity in the superior parietal cortex when participants perceived an illusory Gestalt impression compared to a simpler interpretation of individual elements. Here we tested whether activity related to the illusory Gestalt can be detected not only during, but also prior to it, by examining the slow fluctuations of resting-state-fMRI activity before the stimulus onset. We presented 31 participants with a bistable motion stimulus, which can be perceived either as four moving dot pairs (local) or two moving illusory squares (global). This allowed us to isolate the specific neural mechanisms that accompany the experience of an illusion under matched sensory input. fMRI was used to measure brain activity in a sparse event-related design. We observed stronger IPS and putamen responses to the stimulus when participants perceived the global interpretation compared to local, confirming the previously reported role of these areas in perceptual grouping. Most importantly, we also observed that the global stimulus interpretation was preceded by an increased activity of the bilateral dorsal insula, which is known to process saliency and gate information for conscious access. Our data suggest an important role of the dorsal insula in shaping an internally generated illusory Gestalt percept.",

    "abstract": "We tested whether sensitivity to acoustic spectrotemporal modulations can be observed from reaction times for normal-hearing and impaired-hearing conditions. In a manual reaction-time task, normal-hearing listeners had to detect the onset of a ripple (with density between 0-8 cycles/octave and a fixed modulation depth of 50%), that moved up or down the log-frequency axis at constant velocity (between 0-64 Hz), in an otherwise-unmodulated broadband white-noise. Spectral and temporal modulations elicited band-pass filtered sensitivity characteristics, with fastest detection rates around 1 cycle/oct and 32 Hz for normal-hearing conditions. These results closely resemble data from other studies that typically used the modulation-depth threshold as a sensitivity criterion. To simulate hearing-impairment, stimuli were processed with a 6-channel cochlear-implant vocoder, and a hearing-aid simulation that introduced separate spectral smearing and low-pass filtering. Reaction times were always much slower compared to normal hearing, especially for the highest spectral densities. Binaural performance was predicted well by the benchmark race model of binaural independence, which models statistical facilitation of independent monaural channels. For the impaired-hearing simulations this implied a \"best-of-both-worlds\" principle in which the listeners relied on the hearing-aid ear to detect spectral modulations, and on the cochlear-implant ear for temporal-modulation detection. Although singular-value decomposition indicated that the joint spectrotemporal sensitivity matrix could be largely reconstructed from independent temporal and spectral sensitivity functions, in line with time-spectrum separability, a substantial inseparable spectral-temporal interaction was present in all hearing conditions. These results suggest that the reaction-time task yields a valid and effective objective measure of acoustic spectrotemporal-modulation sensitivity.",

Here, we show that differences in specific metabolic regulation explain the frequent presence of lasR loss-of-function mutations in the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While LasR contributes to virulence, lasR mutants have been associated with more severe disease. A model based on the intrinsic growth kinetics for a wild type strain and its LasR- derivative, in combination with an experimental evolution based genetic screen and further genetics analyses, indicated that differences in metabolism were sufficient to explain the rise of these common mutant types. The evolution of LasR- lineages in laboratory and clinical isolates depended on activity of the two-component system CbrAB, which modulates substrate prioritization through the catabolite repression control pathway. LasR- lineages frequently arise in cystic fibrosis lung infections and their detection correlates with disease severity. Our analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid metabolomes identified compounds that negatively correlate with lung function, and we show that these compounds support enhanced growth of LasR- cells in a CbrB-controlled manner. We propose that in vivo metabolomes are a major driver of pathogen evolution, which may influence the progression of disease and its treatment.",

    "abstract": "The canonical function of a bacterial sigma ({sigma}) factor is to determine the gene specificity of the RNA polymerase (RNAP). In several diverse bacterial species, the {sigma}54 factor uniquely confers distinct functional and regulatory properties on the RNAP. A hallmark feature of the {sigma}54-RNAP is the obligatory requirement for an activator ATPase to allow transcription initiation. The genes that rely upon {sigma}54 for their transcription have a wide range of different functions suggesting that the repertoire of functions performed by genes, directly or indirectly affected by {sigma}54, is not yet exhaustive. By comparing the non-planktonic growth properties of prototypical enteropathogenic, uropathogenic and non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strains devoid of {sigma}54, we uncovered {sigma}54 as a determinant of homogenous non-planktonic growth specifically in the uropathogenic strain. Notably, bacteria devoid of individual activator ATPases of the {sigma}54-RNAP do not phenocopy the {sigma}54 mutant strain. It seems that {sigma}54s role as a determinant of homogenous non-planktonic growth represents a putative non-canonical function of {sigma}54 in regulating genetic information flow.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsEmerging studies reveal a unique bacterial community in the human bladder, with alteration of composition associated to disease states. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease that is characterized by frequent impairment of the kidney. Here, we explored the bladder microbiome, metabolome, and cytokine profiles in SLE patients, as well as correlations between microbiome and metabolome, cytokines, and disease profiles.\n\nMethods and materialsWe recruited a cohort of 50 SLE patients and 50 individually matched asymptomatic controls. We used transurethral catheterization to collect urine samples, 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile bladder microbiomes, and LC-MS/MS to perform untargeted metabolomic profiling.\n\nResultsCompared to controls, SLE patients possessed a unique bladder microbial community and increased alpha diversity. These differences were accompanied by differences in urinary metabolomes, cytokines, and patients disease profiles. The SLE-enriched genera, including Bacteroides, were positively correlated with several SLE-enriched metabolites, including olopatadine. The SLE-depleted genera, such as Pseudomonas, were negatively correlated to SLE-depleted cytokines, including IL-8. Alteration of the bladder microbiome was associated with disease profile. For example, the genera Megamonas and Phocaeicola were negatively correlated with serum complement C3, and Streptococcus was positively correlated with IgG.\n\nConclusionsOur present study reveals associations between the bladder microbiome and the urinary metabolome, cytokines, and disease phenotypes. Our results could help identify biomarkers for SLE.",

    "abstract": "Soil microorganisms drive ecosystem function, but challenges of scale between microbe and ecosystem hinder our ability to accurately quantify and predictively model the soil microbe-ecosystem function relationship. Quantifying this relationship necessitates studies that systematically characterize multi-omics of soil microorganisms and their activity across sampling scales from spatially resolved to bulk measures, and structural complexity, from liquid pure culture to in situ. To address this need, we cultured two diazotrophic bacteria in liquid and solid media, with and without nitrogen (N) to quantify differences in extracellular metabolites associated with nitrogen fixation under increasing environmental structural complexity. We also quantified extracellular metabolites across sampling scales including bulk sampling via GC-MS analysis and spatially resolved analysis via MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. We found extracellular production of inorganic and organic N during free-living nitrogen fixation activity, highlighting a key mechanism of terrestrial N contributions from this process. Additionally, our results emphasize the need to consider the structural complexity of the environment and spatial scale when quantifying microbial activity. We found differences in metabolite profiles between culture conditions, supporting previous work indicating environmental structure influences microbial function, and across scales, underscoring the need to quantify microbial scale conditions to accurately interpret microbial function.\n\nImportanceStudying soil microorganisms, both who is present and what they are doing, is a challenge because of vast differences in scale between microorganism and ecosystem and because of inherent complexities of the soil system (e.g., opacity, chemical complexity). This makes measuring and predicting important ecosystem processes driven by soil microorganisms, like free-living nitrogen fixation, difficult. Free-living nitrogen fixing bacteria play a key role in terrestrial nitrogen contributions and may represent a significant, yet overlooked, nitrogen source in agricultural systems like bioenergy crops. However, we still know very little about how free-living nitrogen fixation contributes nitrogen to terrestrial systems. Our work provides key insight by hierarchically increasing structural complexity (liquid vs. solid culture) and scale (spatially resolved vs. bulk) to address the impact of environmental structure and sampling scale on detection of free-living nitrogen fixation and to identify the forms of nitrogen contributed to terrestrial systems by free-living nitrogen bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The exocyst is a conserved multimeric complex that participates in the final steps of the secretion of vesicles. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the exocyst is crucial for polar growth, morphology, and the organization of the Spitzenkorper (Spk), the apical body where secretory vesicles accumulate before being delivered to the plasma membrane. In the highly polarized cells of N. crassa, the exocyst subunits SEC-3, SEC-5, SEC-6, SEC-8, and SEC-15 were previously found localized at the plasma membrane of the cells apices, while EXO-70 and EXO-84 occupied the frontal outer layer of the Spk, occupied by vesicles. The localization of SEC-10 had remained so far elusive. In this work, SEC-10 was tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) either at its N- or C-terminus and found localized at the plasma membrane of growing hyphal tips, similar to what was previously observed for some exocyst subunits. While expression of an N-terminally tagged version of SEC-10 at its native locus was fully viable, expression of a C-terminally tagged version at its native locus resulted in severe hyphal growth and polarity defects. Additionally, a sec-10 knockout mutant in a heterokaryotic state (with genetically different nuclei) was viable but showed a strongly aberrant phenotype, confirming that this subunit is essential to maintain hyphal morphogenesis. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the lack of a Spk in the SEC-10-GFP strain, suggesting a critical role of the exocyst in the vesicular organization at the Spk. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed fewer peptides of exocyst subunits interacting with SEC-10-GFP than with GFP-SEC-10, suggesting an essential role of the C-terminus of SEC-10 in exocyst assembly and/or stability. Altogether, our data suggest that an unobstructed C-terminus of SEC-10 is indispensable for the exocyst complex function and that a GFP tag could be blocking important subunit-subunit interactions.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen causing osteomyelitis through hematogenous seeding or contamination of implants and open wounds following orthopedic surgeries. The severity of S. aureus-mediated osteomyelitis is enhanced in obesity-related type 2 diabetes (obesity/T2D) due to chronic inflammation impairing both adaptive and innate immunity. Obesity-induced inflammation is linked to gut dysbiosis, with modification of the gut microbiota by high-fiber diets leading to a reduction in the symptoms and complications of obesity/T2D. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which modifications of the gut microbiota alter host infection responses is limited. To address this gap, we monitored tibial S. aureus infections in obese/T2D mice treated with the inulin-like fructan fiber, oligofructose. Treatment with oligofructose significantly decreased S. aureus colonization and lowered proinflammatory signaling post-infection in obese/T2D mice, as observed by decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines (TNF-) and chemokines (IP-10, KC, MIG, MCP-1, and RANTES), indicating partial reduction in inflammation. Oligofructose markedly shifted diversity in the gut microbiota of obese/T2D mice mice, with notable increases in the anti-inflammatory bacterium, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum. Analysis of the cecum and plasma metabolome suggested polyamine production was increased, specifically spermine and spermidine. Oral administration of these polyamines to obese/T2D mice resulted in reduced infection severity similar to oligofructose supplementation, suggesting polyamines can mediate the beneficial effects of fiber on osteomyelitis severity. These results demonstrate the contribution of gut microbiota metabolites to the control of bacterial infections distal to the gut and polyamines as an adjunct therapeutic for osteomyelitis in obesity/T2D.\n\nImportanceIndividuals with obesity-related type 2 diabetes (obesity/T2D) are at a five times increased risk for invasive Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis (bone infection) following orthopedic surgeries. With increasing antibiotic resistance and limited discoveries of novel antibiotics, it is imperative we explore other avenues for therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrated that the dietary fiber oligofructose markedly reduced osteomyelitis severity and hyperinflammation following acute implant-associated osteomyelitis in obese/T2D mice. Reduced infection severity is associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and metabolism as indicated by increased production of natural polyamines in the gut and circulating plasma. This work identifies a novel role for the gut microbiome in mediating control of bacterial infections and polyamines as beneficial metabolites involved in improving the obesity/T2D host response to osteomyelitis. Understanding the impact of polyamines on host immunity and mechanisms behind decreasing susceptibility to severe implant-associated osteomyelitis is crucial to improving treatment strategies for this patient population.",

A meta-analysis of methylation of 100 genes, 50 in the HG group and 50 in IntG, showed significant differences (p<0.0001) between our groups in the level of absolute methylation values of genes bodies and its promoters. We showed a reliable decrease of absolute methylation values in IntG with rising age in contrast to HG, where this level remained constant. The one-sided decrease in methylation in the IntG group is indirectly confirmed by the dispersion data analysis, which also decreased in the genes of this group. The imbalance between HG and IntG in methylation levels suggests that this IntG-shift is a side effect of the ontogenesis grownup program and the main cause of aging. The theoretical model of functional genome division also suggests the leading role of slow dividing and post mitotic cells in triggering and implementing the aging process.",

Here we report the comprehensive analysis of amino acid residue changes that have occurred in lineage B {beta}-coronaviruses that show covariance with each other. This analysis revealed patterns of covariance within conserved viral proteins that potentially define conserved interactions within and between core proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 related {beta}-coranaviruses. We identified not only individual pairs but also networks of amino acid residues that exhibited statistically high frequencies of covariance with each other using an independent pair model followed by a tandem model approach. Using 149 different CoV genomes that vary in their relatedness, we identified networks of unique combinations of alleles that can be incrementally traced genome by genome within different phylogenic lineages. Remarkably, covariant residues and their respective regions most abundantly represented are implicated in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 are also enriched in dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Canonically, MST1/2 functions as a core kinase of the Hippo pathway and non-canonically is both activated during apoptotic signaling and acts in concert with RASSFs in T-cells. Faithful signal transduction relies on both appropriate activation and regulated substrate phosphorylation by the activated kinase. Considerable progress has been made understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating activation of MST1/2 and identifying downstream signaling events. Here we present a kinetic analysis analyzing how the ability of MST1/2 to phosphorylate substrates is regulated. Using a steady state kinetic system, we parse the contribution of different factors including the domains of MST2, phosphorylation, caspase cleavage, and complex formation to MST2 activity. In the unphosphorylated state, we find the SARAH domain stabilizes substrate binding. Phosphorylation, we also determine, drives activation of MST2 and that once activated the kinase domain is free of regulation. The binding partners SAV1, MOB1A, and RASSF5 do not alter the kinetics of phosphorylated MST2. We also show that the caspase cleaved MST2 fragment is as active as full-length suggesting that the linker region of MST2 does not inhibit the catalytic activity of the kinase domain but instead regulates MST2 activity through non-catalytic mechanisms. This kinetic analysis helps establish a framework for interpreting how signaling events, mutations, and post-translational modifications contribute to signaling of MST2 in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The H3K4me3 chromatin modification, a hallmark of promoters of actively transcribed genes, is dynamically removed by the KDM5 family of histone demethylases. The KDM5 demethylases have a number of accessory domains, two of which, ARID and PHD1, lie between the segments of the catalytic domain. KDM5C, which has a unique role in neural development, harbors a number of mutations adjacent to its accessory domains that cause X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). The roles of these accessory domains remain unknown, limiting an understanding of how XLID mutations affect KDM5C activity. Through in vitro binding and kinetic studies using nucleosomes, we find that while the ARID domain is required for efficient nucleosome demethylation, the PHD1 domain alone has an inhibitory role in KDM5C catalysis. In addition, the unstructured linker region between the ARID and PHD1 domains interacts with PHD1 and is necessary for nucleosome binding. Our data suggests a model in which the PHD1 domain inhibits DNA recognition by KDM5C. This inhibitory effect is relieved by the H3 tail, enabling recognition of flanking DNA on the nucleosome. Importantly, we find that XLID mutations adjacent to the ARID and PHD1 domains break this regulation by enhancing DNA binding, resulting in the loss of specificity of substrate chromatin recognition and rendering demethylase activity lower in the presence of flanking DNA. Our findings suggest a model by which specific XLID mutations could alter chromatin recognition and enable euchromatin-specific dysregulation of demethylation by KDM5C.",

Csk also binds phosphatases, including PTPN12 (PTP-PEST) and immune-cell PTPN22 (LYP/Pep), which dephosphorylate the SFK activation loop to promote autoinhibition. Csk-binding proteins (e.g., CBP/PAG1) oligomerize within membrane microdomains, and high local concentration promotes Csk function. Purified Csk homodimerizes in solution through an interface that overlaps the phosphatase binding footprint. Here we demonstrate that Csk can homodimerize in Jurkat T cells, in competition with PTPN22 binding. We designed SH3-domain mutations in Csk that selectively impair homodimerization (H21I) or PTPN22 binding (K43D) and verified their kinase activity in solution. Disruption of either interaction, however, decreased the negative-regulatory function of Csk in cells. Csk W47A, a substitution previously reported to block PTPN22 binding, also impairs homodimerization. Csk H21I and K43D will be useful tools for dissecting the protein-specific drivers of autoimmunity mediated by the human polymorphism PTPN22 R620W, which impairs interaction with Csk and with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3. Future investigations of Csk homodimer activity and phosphatase interactions may reveal new facets of SFK regulation in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells.",

    "abstract": "Genes functionally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and genes functionally related to COVID-19 disease can be different, whose distinction will become the first essential step for successfully fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this first step has not been completed in all biological and medical research. Using a newly developed maxcompeting logistic classifier, two genes, ATP6V1B2 and IFI27, stand out to be critical in transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection with differential expressions derived from NP/OP swab PCR. This finding is evidenced by combining these two genes with one another gene in predicting disease status to achieve better-indicating accuracy than existing classifiers with the same number of genes. In addition, combining these two genes with three other genes to form a five-gene classifier outperforms existing classifiers with ten or more genes. These two genes can be critical in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic as a new focus and direction with their exceptional predicting accuracy. Comparing the functional effects of these genes with a five-gene classifier with 100% accuracy identified and tested from blood samples in our earlier work, genes and their transcriptional response and functional effects to SARS-CoV-2 infection and genes and their functional signature patterns to COVID-19 antibody are significantly different, which can be interpreted as the former is the point of a phenomenon, and the latter is the essence of the disease. We will use a total of fourteen cohort studies (including breakthrough infections and omicron variants) with 1481 samples to justify our results. Such significant findings can help explore the causal and pathological clue between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease and fight against the disease with more targeted genes, vaccines, antiviral drugs, and therapies.",

Stem-loops are some of the most common RNA structural motifs and serve as building blocks for the formation of more complex RNA structures. Given their prevalence and integral role in RNA folding, the kinetics of stem-loop (un)folding has been extensively characterized using both experimental and computational approaches. Interestingly, these studies have reported vastly disparate timescales of (un)folding, which has been recently interpreted as evidence that (un)folding of even simple stem-loops occurs on a highly rugged conformational energy landscape. Because smFETs do not rely on fluorophore reporters of conformation or on the application of mechanical (un)folding forces, they provide a unique and complementary approach that has allowed us to directly monitor tens of thousands of (un)folding events of individual stem-loops at a 200 s time resolution. Our results show that under our experimental conditions, stem-loops fold and unfold over a 1-200 ms timescale during which they transition between ensembles of unfolded and folded conformations, the latter of which is composed of at least two sub-populations. The 1-200 ms timescale of (un)folding we observe here indicates that smFETs report on complete (un)folding trajectories in which unfolded conformations of the RNA spend long periods of time wandering the free-energy landscape before sampling one of several misfolded conformations or, alternatively, the natively folded conformation. Our findings demonstrate how the combination of single-molecule sensitivity and high time resolution makes smFETs unique and powerful tools for characterizing the conformational free-energy landscape of RNA and highlight the extremely rugged landscape on which even the simplest RNA structural elements fold.",

    "abstract": "Age related cancer is not only due to the random accumulation of mutations, but also how phenotypes are selected by the aging environment. While fatty bone marrow (FBM), is one of the hallmarks of bone marrow ageing, it is unknown whether FBM can modify the evolution of the early stages of leukemia and clonal hematopoiesis (CH). To address this question, we established FBM mice models and transplanted both human and mice preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells (PreL-HSCs) carrying DNMT3A mutations. We demonstrate that castration which models age related andropenia result in FBM. A significant increase in self-renewal was found when DNMT3AMut - preL-HSPCs were exposed to FBM. To better understand the mechanisms of the FBM-preL-HSPCs interaction, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on HSPCs three days after FBM exposure. A 20-50 fold increase in DNMT3AMut-preL-HSCs was observed under FBM conditions in comparison to other conditions. PreL-HSPCs exposed to FBM exhibited an activated inflammatory signaling (IL-6 and INF{gamma}). Cytokine analysis of BM fluid demonstrated increased IL-6 levels under FBM conditions. Anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced the selective advantage of DNMT3AMut-preL-HSPCs exposed to FBM. Overall, age related paracrine FBM inflammatory signals promote DNMT3A-driven clonal hematopoiesis, which can be inhibited by blocking the IL-6 receptor.",

    "abstract": "Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is the process that protects photosynthetic organisms from photodamage by dissipating the energy absorbed in excess as heat. In the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, NPQ was abolished in the knock-out mutants of the pigment-protein complexes LHCSR3 and LHCBM1. However, while LHCSR3 was shown to be a pH sensor and switching to a quenched conformation at low pH, the role of LHCBM1 in NPQ has not been elucidated yet. In this work, we combine biochemical and physiological measurements to study short-term high light acclimation of npq5, the mutant lacking LHCBM1. We show that while in low light in the absence of this complex, the antenna size of PSII is smaller than in its presence, this effect is marginal in high light, implying that a reduction of the antenna is not responsible for the low NPQ. We also show that the mutant expresses LHCSR3 at the WT level in high light, indicating that the absence of this complex is also not the reason. Finally, NPQ remains low in the mutant even when the pH is artificially lowered to values that can switch LHCSR3 to the quenched conformation. It is concluded that both LHCSR3 and LHCBM1 need to be present for the induction of NPQ and that LHCBM1 is the interacting partner of LHCSR3. This interaction can either enhance the quenching capacity of LHCSR3 or connect this complex with the PSII supercomplex.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular compartments are functional units that support the metabolic processes within living cells, through spatiotemporal regulation of chemical reactions and biological processes. Consequently, as a step forward in the bottom-up creation of artificial cells, building analogous intracellular architectures is essential for the expansion of cell-mimicking functionality. Herein, we report the development of a droplet laboratory platform to engineer customised complex emulsion droplets as a multicompartment artificial cell chassis, using multiphase microfluidics and acoustic levitation. Such levitated constructs provide free-standing, dynamic, definable droplet networks for the encapsulation and organisation of chemical species. Equally, they can be remotely operated with pneumatic, heating, and magnetic elements for post-processing, including the incorporation of membrane proteins; alpha-hemolysin; and large-conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscL) and their activation. The assembly of droplet networks is three-dimensionally patterned with fluidic inputs configurations determining droplet contents and connectivity. Whilst acoustic manipulation can be harnessed to reconfigure the droplet network in situ. In addition, a mechanosensitive channel, MscL, can be repeatedly activated and deactivated in the levitated artificial cell by the application of acoustic and magnetic fields to modulate membrane tension on demand. This offers possibilities beyond one-time chemically mediated activation to provide repeated, non-contact control of membrane protein function. Collectively, this will expand our capability to program and operate increasingly sophisticated artificial cells as life-like materials.",

    "abstract": "Enantiopure amino acids are of particular interest in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we reported a multi-enzyme cascade for efficient production of L-phenylglycine (L-Phg) from biobased L-phenylalanine (L-Phe). We first attempted to engineer Escherichia coli for expressing L-amino acid deaminase (LAAD) from Proteus mirabilis, hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from Amycolatopsis orientalis, (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase (SMDH) from Pseudomonas putida, the endogenous aminotransferase (AT) encoded by ilvE and L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) from E. coli. However, 10 mM L-Phe only afforded the synthesis of 7.21 {+/-} 0.15 mM L-Phg. The accumulation of benzoylformic acid suggested that the transamination step might be rate-limiting. We next used leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) from Bacillus cereus to bypass the use of L-glutamate as amine donor, and 40 mM L-Phe gave 39.97 {+/-} 3.84 mM (6.04 {+/-} 0.58 g/L) L-Phg, reaching 99.9% conversion. In summary, this work demonstrated a concise four-step enzymatic cascade for the L-Phg synthesis from biobased L-Phe, with a potential for future industrial applications.\n\nGraphical abstracta concise four-step enzymatic cascade for the L-phenylglycine synthesis from biobased L-phenylalanine was devised. 40 mM L-phenylalanine afforded the synthesis of 39.97 {+/-} 3.84 mM (6.04 {+/-} 0.58 g/L) L-phenylglycine, reaching 99.9% conversion.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/476296v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f4aa0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ac5bdeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c372a2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19afa7b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn rheumatoid arthritis (RA), fibroblast like synoviocytes (FLS) undergo a \"tumor-like\" transformation, wherein they develop an aggressive phenotype that is characterized by increased adhesion to components of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) and that contributes extensively to joint destruction. The collagen binding integrin 11{beta}1 was previously shown to be involved in similar processes in cancer-associated fibroblasts mediating tumorigenicity and metastasis in certain tumors. Therefore, this study aimed to study the role of integrin 11{beta}1 in RA and to characterize the effects of 11{beta}1 deficiency on the disease course and severity in arthritic hTNFtg mice.\n\nMethodsThe expression levels of integrin 11{beta}1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blot analysis in synovial samples and FLS of patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA) as well as in samples from wild type (wt) and arthritic hTNFtg mice. Furthermore, the subcellular expression of integrin 11{beta}1 was investigated in co-culture experiments with cartilage explants and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. To investigate the effects of integrin 11{beta}1 deficiency, itga11-/- mice were interbred with hTNFtg mice and disease severity was assessed by clinical scoring of grip strength and paw swelling over the disease course. Hind paws of 12-weeks-old mice of all genotypes were analyzed by {micro}CT imaging followed by stainings of paraffin-embedded tissue sections with Toluidine-blue and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) to evaluate established parameters of joint destruction such as inflammation area, cartilage destaining, FLS attachment to the cartilage surface, and bone damage.\n\nResultsExpression levels of integrin 11{beta}1 were clearly elevated in synovial tissues and FLS from RA patients and hTNFtg mice, compared to the controls derived from OA patients and wt mice. Interestingly, this expression was shown to be particularly localized in focal adhesions of the FLS. As revealed by transmission electron microscopy, integrin 11{beta}1 expression was particularly evident in areas of direct cellular contact with the ECM of cartilage. Evaluations of clinical scorings and histomorphological analyses demonstrated that itga11-/-hTNFtg displayed alleviated clinical symptoms, higher bone volume, less cartilage destruction and reduced FLS attachment to the cartilage in comparison to hTNFtg mice.\n\nConclusionsThe collagen-binding integrin 11{beta}1 is upregulated in the context of RA and its deficiency in mice with an inflammatory hTNFtg background leads to a significant reduction in the arthritic phenotype which makes integrin 11{beta}1 an interesting target for therapeutical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Fasciola spp. liver fluke have significant impacts in veterinary and human medicine. The absence of a vaccine and increasing anthelmintic resistance threaten sustainable control and underscore the need for novel flukicides. Functional genomic approaches underpinned by in vitro culture of juvenile Fasciola hepatica facilitate control target validation in the most pathogenic life stage. Comparative transcriptomics of in vitro and in vivo maintained 21 day old F. hepatica finds that 86% of genes are expressed at similar levels across maintenance treatments suggesting commonality in core biological functioning within these juveniles. Phenotypic comparisons revealed higher cell proliferation and growth rates in the in vivo juveniles compared to their in vitro counterparts. These phenotypic differences were consistent with the upregulation of neoblast-like stem cell and cell-cycle associated genes in in vivo maintained worms. The more rapid growth/development of in vivo juveniles was further evidenced by a switch in cathepsin protease expression profiles, dominated by cathepsin B in in vitro juveniles and then by cathepsin L in in vivo juveniles. Coincident with more rapid growth/development was the marked downregulation of both classical and peptidergic neuronal signalling components in in vivo maintained juveniles, supporting a role for the nervous system in regulating liver fluke growth and development. Differences in the miRNA complements of in vivo and in vitro juveniles identified 31 differentially expressed miRNAs, notably fhe-let-7a-5p, fhe-mir-124-3p and, miRNAs predicted to target Wnt-signalling, supporting a key role for miRNAs in driving the growth/developmental differences in the in vitro and in vivo maintained juvenile liver fluke. Widespread differences in the expression of neuronal genes in juvenile fluke grown in vitro and in vivo expose significant interplay between neuronal signalling and the rate of growth/development, encouraging consideration of neuronal targets in efforts to dysregulate growth/development for parasite control.\n\nAuthor SummaryParasitic worms are notoriously difficult to study outside of a host organism. However, recent developments in culture methods for Fasciola hepatica liver fluke juveniles support growth and development of these parasites in the laboratory (in vitro) towards adult parasites. Having the ability to grow pathogenic juvenile stages in vitro enables functional studies to validate potential drug and vaccine targets. However, comparison of in vitro grown juveniles to juveniles retrieved from infected hosts (in vivo) shows considerable size differences suggesting at least some differences in biology that could undermine the relevance of data generated from in vitro maintained parasites. This study examines gene expression differences between in vitro and in vivo maintained F. hepatica juveniles via transcriptomic analysis to identify similarities and differences in their biology which may help explain differences in the rate of growth and development. 86% of genes were shown to be expressed at similar levels across treatment groups suggesting a high level of biological similarity between in vitro and in vivo juveniles. However, the genes that are expressed differently between these juveniles will help improve current culture methods and provide a new group of potential drug targets that impact on juvenile growth and development.",

    "abstract": "The unfolding of ubiquitylated proteins by the p97 / Cdc48 ATPase and its ubiquitin receptors Ufd1-Npl4 is essential in many areas of eukaryotic cell biology. Previous studies showed that yeast Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 is governed by a quality control mechanism, whereby substrates must be conjugated to at least five ubiquitins. Here we show that substrate processing by mammalian p97-UFD1-NPL4 involves a complex interplay between ubiquitin chain length and additional p97 cofactors. Using disassembly of the ubiquitylated CMG helicase as a model in vitro system, we find that reconstituted p97-UFD1-NPL4 only unfolds substrates with very long ubiquitin chains. However, this high ubiquitin threshold is greatly reduced, to a level resembling yeast Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4, by the UBXN7, FAF1 or FAF2 partners of mammalian p97-UFD1-NPL4. Stimulation by UBXN7/FAF1/FAF2 requires the UBX domain that connects each factor to p97, together with the ubiquitin-binding UBA domain of UBXN7 and a previously uncharacterised coiled-coil domain in FAF1/FAF2. Furthermore, we show that deletion of the UBXN7 and FAF1 genes impairs CMG disassembly during S-phase and mitosis and sensitises cells to reduced ubiquitin ligase activity. These findings indicate that multiple UBX proteins are important for the efficient unfolding of ubiquitylated proteins by p97-UFD1-NPL4 in mammalian cells.",

As previously observed, RecET is superior to Red for this reaction when the terminal homology is 50 bases. Deletion of the E. coli xonA gene, encoding Exonuclease I, a 3[-&gt;]5 single-strand DNA exonuclease, substantially improves the efficiency of in vivo linear DNA assembly for both systems. Deletion of ExoI function allowed robust RecET assembly of six DNA segments to create a functional plasmid. The linear DNAs are joined accurately with very few errors.

    "abstract": "Some G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands act as \"biased agonists\" which preferentially activate specific signaling transducers over others. Although GPCRs are primarily found at the plasma membrane, GPCRs can traffic to and signal from many subcellular compartments. Here, we determine that differential subcellular signaling contributes to the biased signaling generated by three endogenous ligands of the chemokine GPCR CXCR3. The signaling profile of CXCR3 changed as it trafficked from the plasma membrane to endosomes in a ligand-specific manner. Endosomal signaling was critical for biased activation of G proteins, {beta}-arrestins, and ERK1/2. In CD8+ T cells, the chemokines promoted unique transcriptional responses predicted to regulate inflammatory pathways. In a mouse model of contact hypersensitivity, {beta}-arrestin-biased CXCR3-mediated inflammation was dependent on receptor internalization. Our work demonstrates that differential subcellular signaling is critical to the overall biased response observed at CXCR3, which has important implications for drugs targeting chemokine receptors and other GPCRs.",

Here, we determined X-ray structures of LIG1/nick DNA complexes with G:T and A:C mismatches and uncovered the ligase strategies that favor or deter ligation of base substitution errors. Our structures revealed that LIG1 active site can accommodate G:T mismatch in a similar conformation with A:T base pairing, while it stays in the LIG1-adenylate intermediate during initial step of ligation reaction in the presence of A:C mismatch at 3'-strand. Moreover, we showed mutagenic ligation and aberrant nick sealing of the nick DNA substrates with 3'-preinserted dG:T and dA:C mismatches, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that AP-Endonuclease 1 (APE1), as a compensatory proofreading enzyme, interacts and coordinates with LIG1 during mismatch removal and DNA ligation.

    "abstract": "Aromatic amines are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. Here, we reported the establishment of a bacterial platform for synthesizing three types of aromatic amines, namely, tyramine, dopamine, and phenylethylamine. Firstly, we expressed aromatic amino acid decarboxylase from Enterococcus faecium (pheDC) in an Escherichia coli strain with an increased shikimate (SHK) pathway flux toward L-tyrosine or L-phenylalanine synthesis. We found that glycerol served as a better carbon source than glucose, resulting in 940{+/-}46 mg/L tyramine from 4% glycerol. Next, the genes of lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), formate acetyltransferase (pflB), phosphate acetyltransferase (pta), and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE) were deleted to mitigate the fermentation byproduct formation. The tyramine level was further increased to 1.965{+/-}0.205 g/L in shake flasks, corresponding to 2.1 times improvement compared with that of the parental strain. By using a similar strategy, we also managed to produce 703{+/-}21 mg/L dopamine and 555{+/-}50 mg/L phenethylamine. In summary, we have demonstrated that the knockout of ldhA-pflB-pta-adhE is an effective strategy in improving aromatic amine productions, and achieved the highest aromatic amine titers in E. coli under shake flasks reported to date.\n\nKey pointsAromatic amino acid decarboxylase from E. faecium was used for aromatic amine production; ldhA, pflB, pta together with adhE were deleted to mitigate the fermentation byproduct formation; Our work represented the best aromatic amine titers reported in E. coli under shake flasks.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex and dynamic meshwork of proteins providing structural support to cells. It also provides biochemical signals governing cellular processes including proliferation and migration. Alterations of ECM structure and/or composition has been shown to lead to, or accompany, many pathological processes including cancer and fibrosis. To understand how the ECM contributes to diseases, we first need to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the ECM of tissues and of its changes during disease progression. Over the past decade, mass-spectrometry-based proteomics has become the state-of-the-art method to profile the protein composition of ECMs. However, existing methods do not fully capture the broad dynamic range of protein abundance in the ECM, nor do they permit to achieve the high coverage needed to gain finer biochemical information, including the presence of isoforms or post-translational modifications. In addition, broadly adopted proteomic methods relying on extended trypsin digestion do not provide structural information on ECM proteins, yet, gaining insights into ECM protein structure is critical to better understanding protein functions. Here, we present the optimization of a time-lapsed proteomic method using limited proteolysis of partially denatured samples and the sequential release of peptides to achieve superior sequence coverage as compared to standard ECM proteomic workflow. Exploiting the spatio-temporal resolution of this method, we further demonstrate how 3-dimensional time-lapsed peptide mapping can identify protein regions differentially susceptible to trypsin and can thus identify sites of post-translational modifications, including protein-protein interactions. We further illustrate how this approach can be leveraged to gain insight on the role of the novel ECM protein SNED1 in ECM homeostasis. We found that the expression of SNED1 by mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in the alteration of overall ECM composition and the sequence coverage of certain ECM proteins, raising the possibility that SNED1 could modify accessibility to trypsin by engaging in protein-protein interactions.",

However, it remains unclear how different physical configurations between sarcomeres and mitochondria alter the energetic support for contractile function. Here, we show that sarcomere cross-sectional area (CSA) varies along its length in a cell type-dependent manner where the reduction in Z-disk CSA relative to the sarcomere center is closely coordinated with mitochondrial network configuration in flies, mice, and humans. Further, we find myosin filaments near the sarcomere periphery are curved relative to interior filaments with greater curvature for filaments near mitochondria compared to sarcoplasmic reticulum. Finally, we demonstrate smaller myosin filament lattice spacing at filament ends than filament centers in a cell type-dependent manner. These data suggest both sarcomere structure and myofilament interactions are influenced by the location and orientation of mitochondria within muscle cells.",

However, little is known about the fate of cotton SAMs as a tunica corpus structure. Here, we demonstrate that cotton SAM fate decisions depend on light signals and circadian rhythms, and the genes GhFKF1, GhGI, GhCRY1 and GhCO were responsible for SAM fate decisions and highlighted via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of different cotton cultivars, as confirmed by genetic analysis via the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In situ hybridization (ISH) analysis showed that the GhCO gene, induced by a relatively high blue light proportion, was highly upregulated during the initiation of floral meristems (FMs). Further blue light treatment analysis showed that the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth of SAM was promoted by a high proportion of blue light, coupled with high expression of the blue light-responsive genes GhCO and GhCRY1. Taken together, our study suggests that blue light signalling plays a key role in the fate decision of cotton SAM. These results provide a strategy to regulate the SAM differentiation of cotton by using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to change the ratio of red and blue light absorption to breed early-maturity cotton.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThe SAM differentiation especially the initiation of floral meristem of upland cotton were mediated by genes GhCO and GhCRY1 which in response to blue light.",

    "abstract": "The lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) is a transient embryonic tissue that gives rise to a diverse range of mature cell types, including the cardiovascular system, the urogenital system, endoskeleton of the limbs, and mesenchyme of the gut. While the genetic processes that drive development of these tissues are well defined, the early cell fate choices underlying LPM development and specification are poorly understood. In this study, we utilize single-cell transcriptomics to define cell lineage specification during development of the anterior LPM and the forelimb field in the chicken embryo. We identify the molecular pathways directing differentiation of the aLPM towards a somatic or splanchnic cell fate, and subsequent emergence of the forelimb mesenchyme. We establish the first transcriptional atlas of progenitor, transitional and mature cell types throughout the early forelimb field and uncover the global signalling pathways which are active during LPM differentiation and forelimb initiation. Specification of the somatic and splanchnic LPM from undifferentiated mesoderm utilizes distinct signalling pathways and involves shared repression of early mesodermal markers, followed by activation of lineage-specific gene modules. We identify rapid activation of the transcription factor TWIST1 in the somatic LPM preceding activation of known limb initiation genes, such as TBX5, which plays a likely role in epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition of the limb bud mesenchyme. Furthermore, development of the somatic LPM and limb is dependent on ectodermal BMP signalling, where BMP antagonism reduces expression of key somatic LPM and limb genes to inhibit formation of the limb bud mesenchyme. Together, these findings provide new insights into molecular mechanisms that drive fate cell choices during specification of the aLPM and forelimb initiation.",

Across species, strategies for stochastic multicolour labelling have greatly facilitated tracking cells in in vivo and mapping neuronal connectivity. Nevertheless, integrating multi-fluorophore information into the context of developing tissues in zebrafish is challenging given their cytoplasmic localization and spectral incompatibility with commonly used fluorescent markers. Here, we developed FRaeppli (Fish-Raeppli) expressing bright membrane-or nuclear-targeted fluorescent proteins for efficient cell shape analysis and tracking. High spatiotemporal activation flexibility is provided by the Gal4/UAS system together with Cre/lox and/or PhiC31integrase. The distinct spectra of the FRaeppli fluorescent proteins allow simultaneous imaging with GFP and infrared subcellular reporters or tissue landmarks. By tailoring hyperspectral protocols for time-efficient acquisition, we demonstrate FRaepplis suitability for live imaging of complex internal organs, like the liver. Combining FRaeppli with polarity markers revealed previously unknown canalicular topologies between differentiating hepatocytes, reminiscent of the mammalian liver, suggesting shared developmental mechanisms. The multispectral FRaeppli toolbox thus enables the comprehensive analysis of intricate cellular morphologies, topologies and tissue lineages at single-cell resolution in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCultured meat is a promising new field with the potential for considerable environmental and animal welfare benefits. One technological approach to cultured meat production utilises the proliferative and differentiative capacity of muscle-derived satellite cells (SCs) to produce large volumes of cultured muscle tissue from small biopsies of donor animals. Differing genotypes between cattle breeds lead to predictable phenotypic traits, resulting in breeds being favoured for their respective meat or milk production characteristics in the livestock industry. However, whilst these breeds show significant differences in muscle growth, it is unclear whether the physiological differences observed between them in vivo are reflected in differences in SC behaviour in vitro, particularly with respect to proliferation, differentiation and cellular longevity, and hence whether particular breeds might represent preferred SC donors for a cultured beef bioprocess.\n\nResultsComparing SCs isolated from five breeds (Belgian Blue, Holstein Friesian, Galloway, Limousin and Simmental), we found that the proliferation rates were largely unaffected by the donor breed. In contrast, potentially meaningful differences were observed in the kinetics and extent of myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, whilst differentiation dropped for all breeds with increasing population doublings (PDs), SCs from Belgian Blue and Limousin cattle showed significantly longer retention of differentiation capacity over long-term passaging.\n\nConclusionSCs from all breeds were able to proliferate and differentiate, although Limousin and (particularly) Belgian Blue cattle, both breeds commonly used for traditional meat production, may represent preferred donors for cultured beef production.",

One key response to dsRNA is the activation of PKR, an eIF2 kinase, which triggers translational arrest and the formation of stress granules. However, the process of PKR activation in cells is not fully understood. In response to increased endogenous or exogenous dsRNA, we observed that PKR forms novel cytosolic condensates, referred to as dsRNA-induced foci (dRIFs). dRIFs contain dsRNA, form in proportion to dsRNA, and are enhanced by longer dsRNAs. dRIFs also enrich several other dsRNA-binding proteins including ADAR1, Stau1, NLRP1, and PACT. Strikingly, dRIFs correlate with and form prior to translation repression by PKR and localize to regions of cells where PKR activation is initiated. We suggest that dRIF formation is a mechanism cells utilize to enhance the sensitivity of PKR activation in response to low levels of dsRNA, or to overcome viral inhibitors of PKR activation.",

    "abstract": "Differences in ciliary morphology and dynamics among multiciliated cells of the respiratory tract have been well reported and known to contribute to efficient mucociliary clearance. Nevertheless, little is known about how phenotypic differences among multiciliated cells are established in the mammalian lung. Here we show that Prominin-1 (Prom1), a transmembrane protein widely used as stem cell and tumor-initiating marker, is crucial to this process. During airway differentiation, Prom1 becomes restricted to multiciliated cells, where it is expressed at distinct levels along the proximal-distal axis of the airways and in the adult airway epithelium in vitro. We found that Prom1 is induced by Notch in post-specified multiciliated cells and that Notch inactivation abolishes the gradients of Prom1 in the developing airways and in differentiating organotypic cultures. Prom1 was not required for multicilia formation and when inactivated resulted in longer cilia, which remained functional but beating at a lower frequency. Disruption of Notch resulted in opposite effects and suggested that Notch fine-tunes Prom1 levels to regulate the multiciliated cell phenotype and generate diversity among these cells in the respiratory tract. By controlling these features, this mechanism contributes to the innate defense of the lung against environmental agents and prevent pulmonary disease.\n\nSignificance StatementMulticiliated cells are integral components of the epithelia from a variety of organs. In the respiratory tract they are crucial for mucociliary clearance, a first line of defense against environmental agents and microorganisms. Regional differences in ciliary morphology and dynamics of multiciliated cells have been well described. However, little is known about the events generating phenotypical and functional differences among these cells in airways. Here we provide evidence of a novel mechanism in post-specified multiciliated progenitors whereby local Notch and Prom1 regulate ciliary length and ciliary beating to generate morphological and functional diversity among the multiciliated cells. The findings provide insights into the impact of these signals in maintaining the integrity and function of the airway epithelium, preventing pulmonary disease.",

    "abstract": "Drugs of abuse can cause local and systemic hyperthermia, a known trigger of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Another trigger of ER stress and UPR is ER calcium depletion which causes ER exodosis, the secretion of ER resident proteins. Club drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA,  ecstasy) can create hyperthermic conditions in the brain and cause toxicity that is affected by the environmental temperature and the presence of other drugs, such as caffeine. Here we examine the secretion of ER resident proteins and activation of the UPR under combined exposure to MDMA and caffeine in a cellular model of hyperthermia. We show that hyperthermia triggers the secretion of normally ER resident proteins and that this aberrant protein secretion is potentiated by the presence of MDMA, caffeine, or a combination of the two drugs. Hyperthermia activates the UPR but the addition of MDMA or caffeine does not alter canonical UPR gene expression despite the drug effects on ER exodosis of UPR-related proteins. One exception was increased BiP/Grp78 mRNA levels in MDMA-treated cells exposed to hyperthermia. These findings suggest that club drug use under hyperthermic conditions exacerbates disruption of ER proteostasis contributing to cellular toxicity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIER resident proteins are redistributed into the extracellular space in response to hyperthermia and caffeine and MDMA further enhance this secretion.\nC_LIO_LIStabilizing ER calcium and overexpressing KDEL receptors reduces ER resident protein secretion following hyperthermia.\nC_LIO_LIHyperthermia triggers a UPR response with MDMA augmenting BiP expression in hyperthermic conditions.\nC_LI",

To determine mechanism, we systematically explored established Rab35 effectors and show that none are operative in endothelial cells. However, we find that Rab35 partners with DENNd1c, an evolutionarily divergent guanine exchange factor, to localize to actin. Here, Rab35 regulates actin polymerization, which is required to setup proper apicobasal polarity during sprout formation.

    "abstract": "The establishment of complex cell shapes is essential for specific cellular functions, and thus critical in animal development and physiology. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are conserved glycoproteins that regulate interactions between extracellular signals and their receptors, to orchestrate morphogenetic events and elicit cellular responses. Although HSPG-regulated pathways have been implicated in regulating the guidance of neuronal migrations, whether HSPGs regulate earlier aspects of cellular development that dictate cell shape remains unknown. HSPGs consist of a protein core (e.g., Syndecan, Perlecan, Glypican, etc.) with attached heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains, which are synthesized by glycosyltransferases of the exostosin family. Using mutations in the two C. elegans HS glycosyltransferases genes, rib-1 and rib-2, we reveal that HSPGs control the number of cellular projections in the epithelial excretory canal cell, which can form more than its normal four canals in these mutants. We identify SDN-1/Syndecan as the key HSPG that regulates the number of excretory canal cell projections in a cell-autonomous manner. We also find that Syndecan and guidance receptors for Netrin function in the same pathway to restrict the number of cellular projections. Furthermore, we show that the formation of extra projections in the absence of Syndecan requires the conserved Rho-family GTPases CED-10/Rac and MIG-2/RhoG. Our findings not only contribute to understanding the roles of conserved HSPGs in cellular morphogenetic events, but also reveal the existence of an HSPG-regulated system operating to guarantee that a precise number of cellular projections is established during cell development. Given the evolutionary conservation of developmental mechanisms and the molecules implicated, this work provides information relevant to understanding the cellular and molecular bases of the development of precise cellular morphologies in varied cell types across animals.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal identity dictates the position in an epithelium, and the ability to detect, process, and transmit specific signals to specified targets. Transcription factors (TFs) determine cellular identity via direct modulation of genetic transcription and recruiting chromatin modifiers. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that define neuronal identity and their magnitude remains a critical barrier to elucidate the etiology of congenital and neurodegenerative disorders. The rodent vomeronasal organ provides a unique system to examine in detail the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation and maturation of chemosensory neurons. Here we demonstrated that the identity of postmitotic/maturing vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs), and vomeronasal dependent behaviors can be reprogrammed through the rescue of tfap2e/AP-2{varepsilon} expression in the AP-2{varepsilon} mice, and partially reprogrammed by inducing ectopic AP-2{varepsilon} expression in mature apical VSNs. We suggest that the transcription factor AP-2{varepsilon} can reprogram VSNs bypassing cellular plasticity restrictions, and that it directly controls the expression of batteries of vomeronasal genes.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/476379v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (56K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f8b849org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afe27org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3e8d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7af3b1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
