    "abstract": "The current study examined the relations between hippocampal structure (e.g., volume and neurite density) and performance on a trace eye blink conditioning (EBC) task in young children. Our first aim assessed whether individual differences in hippocampal volume were associated with trace EBC performance, using both percent Conditioned Responses (% CR) and CR onset latency or the average latency (ms) at which the child started their blink, as measures of hippocampal-dependent associative learning. Our second aim evaluated whether individual differences in hippocampal neurite density were associated with EBC performance using the same outcome measures. Typically developing 4- to 6-year-olds (N = 31; 14 girls; Mage = 5.67; SDage = 0.89) completed T1 and diffusion-weighted MRI scans and a 15-minute trace eyeblink conditioning task outside of the scanner. % CR and CR onset latency were computed across all tone-puff and tone-alone trials. While hippocampal volume was not associated with any of our EBC measures, greater hippocampal neurite density bilaterally, was associated with later CR onset. In other words, children with greater left and right hippocampal neurite density blinked closer to the US (i.e., air puff) than children with less hippocampal neurite density, indicating that structural changes in the hippocampus assisted in the accurate timing of conditioned responses.",

    "abstract": "Comparing artificial neural networks with outputs of neuroimaging techniques has recently seen substantial advances in (computer) vision and text-based language models. Here, we propose a framework to compare biological and artificial neural computations of spoken language representations and propose several new challenges to this paradigm. The proposed technique is based on a similar principle that underlies electroencephalography (EEG): averaging of neural (artificial or biological) activity across neurons in the time domain, and allows to compare encoding of any acoustic property in the brain and in intermediate convolutional layers of an artificial neural network. Our approach allows a direct comparison of responses to a phonetic property in the brain and in deep neural networks that requires no linear transformations between the signals. We argue that the brain stem response (cABR) and the response in intermediate convolutional layers to the exact same stimulus are highly similar and quantify this observation. The proposed technique not only reveals similarties, but also allows for analysis of the encoding of actual acoustic properties in the two signals: we compare peak latency (i) in cABR relative to the stimulus in the brain stem and in (ii) intermediate convolutional layers relative to the input/output in deep convolutional networks. We also examine and compare the effect of prior language exposure on the peak latency in cABR and in intermediate convolutional layers. Substantial similarities in peak latency encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional networks emerge based on results from eight trained networks (including a replication experiment). The proposed technique can be used to compare encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional layers for any acoustic property and for other neuroimaging techniques.",

    "abstract": "The lack of clinically applicable mucosal adjuvants is a major hurdle in designing effective mucosal vaccines. We hereby report that the calcium-binding protein S100A4, which regulates a wide range of biological functions, is a potent mucosal adjuvant in mice for co-administered antigens, including the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with comparable or even superior efficacy as cholera toxin but without causing any adverse reactions. Intranasal immunization with recombinant S100A4 elicited antigen-specific antibody and pulmonary cytotoxic T cell responses, and these responses were remarkably sustained for longer than six months. As a self-protein, S100A4 did not stimulate antibody responses against itself, a quality desired of adjuvants. S100A4 prolonged nasal residence of intranasally delivered antigens and promoted migration of antigen-presenting cells. S100A4-pulsed dendritic cells potently activated cognate T cells. Furthermore, S100A4 induced strong germinal center responses revealed by both microscopy and mass spectrometry, a novel technique for measuring germinal center activity. In conclusion, S100A4 may be a promising adjuvant in formulating mucosal vaccines, including vaccines against pathogens that infect via the respiratory tract, such as SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Diffusible signal factors (DSFs) are medium-chain fatty acids that induce bacterial quorum sensing. Among these compounds, BDSF is a structural analog of DSF that is commonly detected in bacterial species (e.g., Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia). Additionally, BDSF contributes to the interkingdom communication regulating fungal life stage transitions. How BDSF is sensed in Xanthomonas spp. and the functional diversity between BDSF and DSF remain unclear. In this study, we generated genetic and biochemical evidence that BDSF is a low-active regulator of X. campestris pv. campestris quorum sensing, whereas trans-BDSF seems not a signaling compound. BDSF is detected by the sensor histidine kinase RpfC. Although BDSF has relatively low physiological activities, it binds to the RpfC sensor with a high affinity and activates RpfC autophosphorylation to a level that is similar to that induced by DSF in vitro. The inconsistency in the physiological and biochemical activities of BDSF is not due to RpfC- RpfG phosphorylation or RpfG hydrolase. Neither BDSF nor DSF controls the phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities of RpfC or the ability of RpfG hydrolase to degrade the bacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP. We demonstrated that BDSF is prone to degradation by RpfB, a critical fatty acyl-CoA ligase involved in the turnover of DSF-family signals. rpfB mutations lead to substantial increases in BDSF-induced quorum sensing. Although DSF and BDSF are similarly detected by RpfC, our data suggest that their differential degradation in cells is the major factor responsible for the diversity in their physiological effects.\n\nIMPORTANCEDiffusible signal factor (DSF) family are quorum-sensing signals employed by gram-negative bacteria. These signals are a group of cis-2-unsaturated fatty acids, such as DSF, BDSF, IDSF, CDSF, and SDSF. However, the functional divergence of various DSF signals remains unclear. The present study demonstrates that though BDSF is a low active quorum-sensing signal than that of DSF, it binds histidine kinase RpfC with a higher affinity and activates RpfC autophosphorylation to the similar level as DSF. Rather than regulation of enzymatic activities of RpfC and its cognate response regulator RpfG encoding a c-di-GMP hydrolase, BDSF is prone to degradation in bacterial cells by RpfB, which effectively avoided the inhibition of bacterial growth by accumulating high concentration of BDSF. Therefore, our study shed new light on the functional difference of quorum-sensing signals and revealed that bacteria balance quorum-sensing and growth by fine-turning concentration of signaling chemical.",

Beef cattle received i) an intranasal cocktail of previously characterized BT strains, ii) an injection of metaphylactic antimicrobial (tulathromycin), or iii) intranasal saline. Despite being transient colonizers, inoculated BT strains induced longitudinal modulation of the nasopharyngeal bacterial microbiota while showing no adverse effect on animal health. The BT-mediated changes in bacteria included reduced diversity and richness and strengthened cooperative and competitive interactions. In contrast, tulathromycin increased bacterial diversity and antibiotic resistance, and disrupted bacterial interactions. Overall, a single intranasal dose of BTs can modulate the bovine respiratory microbiota, highlighting that microbiome-based strategies have the potential in being utilized to mitigate BRD in feedlot cattle.",

    "abstract": "An H1N1 influenza virus caused a pandemic in 2009 and descendants of this virus continue to circulate seasonally in humans. Upon infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain (pH1N1), many humans produced antibodies against epitopes in the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk. HA stalk-focused antibody responses were common among pH1N1-infected individuals because HA stalk epitopes were conserved between the pH1N1 strain and previously circulating H1N1 strains. Here, we completed a series of experiments to determine if the pH1N1 HA stalk has acquired substitutions since 2009 that prevent the binding of human antibodies. We identified several amino acid substitutions that have accrued in the pH1N1 HA stalk from 2009-2019. We completed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, absorption-based binding assays, and surface plasmon resonance experiments to determine if these substitutions affect antibody binding. Using sera collected from 230 humans (aged 21-80 years), we found that pH1N1 HA stalk substitutions that have emerged since 2009 do not affect antibody binding. Our data suggest that the HA stalk domain of pH1N1 viruses remained antigenically stable after circulating in humans for a decade.\n\nImportanceIn 2009, a new pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus began circulating in humans. Many individuals mounted hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-focused antibody responses upon infection with the 2009 pH1N1, since the HA stalk of this virus was relatively conserved with other seasonal H1N1 strains. Here, we completed a series of studies to determine if the 2009 pH1N1 strain has undergone antigenic drift in the HA stalk domain over the past decade. We found that serum antibodies from 230 humans could not antigenically distinguish the 2009 and 2019 HA stalk. These data suggest that the HA stalk of pH1N1 has remained antigenically stable, despite the presence of high levels of HA stalk antibodies within the human population.",

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) mediate the shuffling of genes among organisms. They contribute to the spread of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in human pathogens, such as the particularly problematic group of ESKAPE pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp. Here, we performed the first systematic analysis of MGEs, including plasmids, prophages, and integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements (ICEs/IMEs), in the ESKAPE pathogens. We characterized over 1700 complete ESKAPE genomes and found that different MGE types are asymmetrically distributed across these pathogens. While some MGEs are capable of exchanging DNA beyond the genus (and phylum) barrier, most horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events are restricted by phylum or genus. We show that the MGEs proteome is involved in diverse functional processes and distinguish widespread proteins within the ESKAPE context. Moreover, anti-CRISPRs and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes are overrepresented in the ESKAPE mobilome. Our results also underscore species-specific trends shaping the number of MGEs, AMR, and virulence genes across pairs of conspecific ESKAPE genomes with and without CRISPR-Cas systems. Finally, we found that CRISPR targets vary according to MGE type: while plasmid and prophage CRISPRs almost exclusively target other plasmids and prophages, respectively, ICEs/IME CRISPRs preferentially target prophages. Overall, our study highlights the general importance of the ESKAPE mobilome in contributing to the spread of AMR and mediating conflict among MGEs.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, a subset of cells in the mesoderm germ layer are specified as hemato- vascular progenitor cells, which then differentiate into endothelial cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In zebrafish, the transcription factor npas4l, also known as cloche, is required for the specification of hemato-vascular progenitor cells. However, it is unclear if npas4l is the sole factor at the top of the hemato-vascular specification cascade. Here we show that arnt1 and arnt2 genes are required for hemato-vascular specification. We found that arnt1;arnt2 double homozygous mutant zebrafish embryos (herein called arnt1/2 mutants), but not arnt1 or arnt2 single mutants, lack blood cells and most vascular endothelial cells. arnt1/2 mutants have reduced or absent expression of etsrp and tal1, the earliest known endothelial and hematopoietic transcription factor genes. npas4l and the arnt genes are PAS domain-containing bHLH transcription factors that function as dimers. We found that Npas4l binds both Arnt1 and Arnt2 proteins in vitro, consistent with the idea that PAS domain- containing bHLH transcription factors act in a multimeric complex to regulate gene expression. Our results demonstrate that npas4l, arnt1 and arnt2 act together to regulate endothelial and hematopoietic cell fate, where each gene is necessary, but by itself not sufficient, to drive hemato-vascular specification. Our results also demonstrate that arnt1 and arnt2 act redundantly in a transcriptional complex containing npas4l, but do not act redundantly when interacting with another PAS domain- containing bHLH transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Altogether, our data enhance our understanding of hemato-vascular specification and the function of PAS domain-containing bHLH transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Hbxip, also named Lamtor5, has been well characterized as a transcriptional coactivator in various cancers. However, the role of Hbxip in normal development remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrated that homozygous knockout of Hbxip leads to embryonic lethality, with retarded growth around E7.5. Using Hbxip knockout embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we showed that depletion of Hbxip compromises the self-renewal of ESCs, with reduced expression of pluripotency genes, reduced cell proliferation, and decreased colony forming capacity. In addition, Hbxip-/- ESCs are defective in differentiation, particularly ectodermal and mesodermal differentiation. Consistently, Hbxip-/- epiblast fails to differentiate properly, indicated by sustained expression of Oct4 in E8.5 Hbxip-/- epiblast. Mechanistically, in ESCs, Hbxip interacts with other components of the Ragulator complex, which is required for mTORC1 activation by amino acids. Importantly, ESCs depleted of Ragulator subunits, Lamtor3 or Lamtor4, display differentiation defects similar to those of Hbxip-/- ESCs. Moreover, Hbxip-/-, p14-/-, and p18-/- mice, lacking subunits of the Ragulator complex, also share similar phenotypes, embryonic lethality and retarded growth around E7-8. Thus, we conclude that Hbxip plays a pivotal role in the development and differentiation of the epiblast, as well as the self-renewal and differentiation of ESCs, through activating mTORC1 signaling.",

The release of organic compounds by these microbes is less well known but may represent an as-yet unaccounted source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) available to heterotrophic marine food webs. Here, we provide measurements of cellular carbon and nitrogen quotas, DIC fixation yields and DOC release of ten phylogenetically diverse marine nitrifiers grown in multiple culture conditions. All investigated strains released DOC during growth, making up on average 5-15% of the fixed DIC. Neither substrate concentration nor temperature affected the proportion of fixed DIC released as DOC, but release rates varied between closely related species. Our results also indicate previous studies may have underestimated DIC fixation yields of marine nitrite oxidizers due to partial decoupling of nitrite oxidation from CO2 fixation, and due to lower observed yields in artificial compared to natural seawater medium. The results of this study provide values for biogeochemical models of the global carbon cycle, and help to further constrain the implications of nitrification-fueled chemoautotrophy for marine food-web functioning and the biological sequestration of carbon in the ocean.",

First, we conducted a systematic review of existing gene expression datasets to identify those with integrated genomic and environmental factors. This enabled us to curate a comprehensive genomic-environmental database for four key environmental factors (smoking, diet, infections and toxic chemicals) associated with various autoimmune and chronic conditions. Second, we developed a statistical analysis package that allows users to interrogate the relationships between differentially expressed genes and environmental factors under different disease conditions.\n\nResultsThe initial database search run on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) retrieved a total of 90,018 articles. After title and abstract screening against pre-set criteria, a total of 186 studies were selected. From those, 243 individual sets of genes, or \"gene modules\", were obtained. We then curated a database containing four environmental factors, namely cigarette smoking, diet, infections and toxic chemicals, along with a total of 25789 genes that had an association with one or more of these gene modules. In six case studies, the database and statistical analysis package were then tested with lists of differentially expressed genes obtained from the published literature related to type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, small cell lung cancer, COVID-19, cobalt exposure and smoking. On testing, we uncovered statistically enriched biological processes, which revealed pathways associated with environmental factors and the genes.\n\nConclusionsA novel curated database and software tool is provided as an R Package. Users can enter a list of genes to discover associated environmental factors under various disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "Mycetoma is a neglected tropical chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. More than 70 species with a broad taxonomic diversity have been implicated as agents of mycetoma. Understanding the full range of causative organisms and their antibiotic sensitivity profiles are essential for the appropriate treatment of infections. The present study focuses on the analysis of full genome sequences and antibiotic resistance profiles of actinomycetoma strains from patients seen at the Mycetoma Research Centre in Sudan with a view to developing rapid diagnostic tests. Seventeen pathogenic isolates obtained by surgical biopsies were sequenced using MinION and Illumina methods, and their antibiotic resistance profiles determined. The results highlight an unexpected diversity of actinomycetoma causing pathogens, including three Streptomyces isolates assigned to species not previously associated with human actinomycetoma and one new Streptomyces species. Thus, current approaches for clinical and histopathological classification of mycetoma may need to be updated. The standard treatment for actinomycetoma is a combination of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Most tested isolates were not susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim or to amoxicillin alone. However, the addition of the {beta}-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid to amoxicillin increased susceptibility, particularly for Streptomyces somaliensis and Streptomyces sudanensis. Actinomadura madurae isolates appear to be particularly resistant under laboratory conditions, suggesting that alternative agents, such as amikacin, should be considered for more effective treatment. The results obtained will inform future diagnostic methods for the identification of actinomycetoma and treatment.\n\nAuthor SummaryMycetoma is a common health and medical problem that is endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries and has devastating effects on patients. The destructive nature of late-stage infection means that treatment often requires long term use of antibiotic therapy, massive surgical excisions and amputation. Several different bacterial species have been described as causing this disease but our understanding of the true diversity of mycetoma causing bacteria has been limited by a lack of molecular sequence data. We have now sequenced the genomes of 17 samples isolated from patients at the Mycetoma Research Centre in Sudan, revealing a diverse range of species associated with infection including one new Streptomyces species, and three species with no previous association with human mycetoma. Crucially, all isolates had a high level of resistance against the current first-line antibiotics used to treat actinomycetoma under laboratory conditions. This resistance was strongest in Actinomadura madurae, which was also the most frequently observed species isolated from patients in our study. We hope that these results will aid in the development of future rapid diagnostic tools and the improvement of treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Animal cell lines cultured for extended periods often undergo extreme genome restructuring events, including polyploidy and segmental aneuploidy that can impede de novo whole-genome assembly (WGA). In Drosophila, many established cell lines also exhibit massive proliferation of transposable elements (TEs) relative to wild-type flies. To better understand the role of transposition during long-term animal somatic cell culture, we sequenced the genome of the tetraploid Drosophila S2R+ cell line using long-read and linked-read technologies. Relative to comparable data from inbred whole flies, WGAs for S2R+ were highly fragmented and generated variable estimates of TE content across sequencing and assembly technologies. We therefore developed a novel WGA-independent bioinformatics method called \"TELR\" that identifies, locally assembles, and estimates allele frequency of TEs from long-read sequence data (https://github.com/bergmanlab/telr). Application of TELR to a [~]130x PacBio dataset for S2R+ revealed many haplotype-specific TE insertions that arose by somatic transposition in cell culture after initial cell line establishment and subsequent tetraploidization. Local assemblies from TELR also allowed phylogenetic analysis of paralogous TE copies within the S2R+ genome, which revealed that proliferation of different TE families during cell line evolution in vitro can be driven by single or multiple source lineages. Our work provides a model for the analysis of TEs in complex heterozygous or polyploid genomes that are not amenable to WGA and yields new insights into the mechanisms of genome evolution in animal cell culture.",

    "abstract": "Barcoded planar microparticles have many qualities suitable for developing cost-efficient multiplexed immunoassays. But at the translational research level, there are a number of technical aspects yet remain to be addressed which includes robustness and efficiency of the assay readout process. Assay readout process involves automated barcode identification and signal intensity values from each planar microparticle. For this, each microparticle has to be correctly aligned for correct barcode readout while being, ideally, compactly assembled for maximum microparticle imaging efficiency. To simultaneously achieve such alignment and assembly of microparticles but in a straightforward manner, we designed a microfluidic microparticle assembling chip that only requires a single pipetting step. Our design utilizes capillary flow based guided particle assembly, which allows maximum microparticle-based immunoassay readout efficiency. With the aid of image processing algorithms, we obtained good multiplex immunoassay readout accuracy similar to conventional imaging platforms. Our approach is applicable to both soft elastomer materials (e.g. PDMS) and rigid materials (e.g. polystyrene), the latter of which is frequently used for injection molding based mass production. We anticipate our device could help developing facile and user-friendly platform technologies based on barcoded planar microparticles.",

Because most scRNA-seq data analyses begin with cell clustering, its accuracy considerably impacts the validity of downstream analyses. Although many clustering methods have been developed, few tools are available to evaluate the clustering \"goodness-of-fit\" to the scRNA-seq data. In this paper, we propose a new Clustering Deviation Index (CDI) that measures the deviation of any clustering label set from the observed single-cell data. We conduct in silico and experimental scRNA-seq studies to show that CDI can select the optimal clustering label set.

    "abstract": "Topological analysis of amino acid networks is a common method that can help to understand the roles of individual residues. The most popular approach for network construction is to create a connection between residues if they interact. These interactions are usually weighted by absolute values of correlation coefficients or mutual information. Here we argue that connections in such networks have to reflect levels of cohesion within the protein instead of a simple fact of interaction between residues. If this is correct, an indiscriminate combination of correlation and anti-correlation, as well as the all-inclusive nature of the mutual information metrics, should be detrimental for the analysis. To test our hypothesis, we studied amino acid networks of the protein kinase A created by Local Spatial Pattern alignment, a method that can detect conserved patterns formed by C-C{beta} vectors. Our results showed that, in comparison with the traditional methods, this approach is more efficient in detecting functionally important residues. Out of four studied centrality metrics, Closeness centrality was the least efficient measure of residue importance. Eigenvector centrality proved to be ineffective as the spectral gap values of the networks were very low due to the bilobal structure of the kinase. We recommend using joint graphs of Betweenness centrality and Degree centrality to visualize different aspects of amino acid roles.\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nProtein structures can be viewed as networks of residues with some of them being a part of highly interconnected hubs and some being connectors between the hubs. Analysis of these networks can be helpful for understanding of possible roles of single amino acids. In this paper, we challenged existing methods for the creation of such networks. A traditional way is to connect residues if they can interact. We propose that residues should be connected only if they retain their mutual positions in space during molecular dynamic simulation, that is they move cohesively. We show that this approach improves the efficiency of the analysis indicating that a significant revision of the existing views on amino acid networks is necessary.",

Here we describe the generation of a collection of pediatric RMS tumor organoid (tumoroid) models comprising all major subtypes. For aggressive tumors, tumoroid models can often be established within four to eight weeks, indicating the feasibility of personalized drug screening. Molecular, genetic and histological characterization show that the models closely resemble the original tumors, with genetic stability over extended culture periods of up to six months. Importantly, drug screening reflects established sensitivities and the models can be modified by CRISPR/Cas9 with TP53 knockout in an embryonal RMS model resulting in replicative stress drug sensitivity. Tumors of mesenchymal origin can therefore be used to generate organoid models, relevant for a variety of preclinical and clinical research questions.",

    "abstract": "Thailand was the first country outside China to officially report COVID-19 cases. Despite the strict regulations for international arrivals, up until February 2021, Thailand had been hit by two major outbreaks. With a large number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from patients, the effects of many genetic variations, especially those unique to Thai strains, are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we analysed 439,197 sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein collected from NCBI and GISAID databases. 595 sequences were from Thailand and contained 52 variants, of which 6 had not been observed outside Thailand (p.T51N, p.P57T, p.I68R, p.S205T, p.K278T, p.G832C). These variants were not predicted to be of concern. We demonstrate that the p.D614G, although already present during the first Thai outbreak, became the prevalent strain during the second outbreak, similarly to what was described in other countries. Moreover, we show that the most common variants detected in Thailand (p.A829T, p.S459F and p.S939F) do not appear to cause any major structural change to the spike trimer or the spike-ACE2 interaction. Among the variants identified in Thailand was p.N501T. This variant, which involves an asparagine critical for spike-ACE2 binding, was not predicted to increase SARS-CoV-2 binding, thus in contrast to the variant of global concern p.N501Y. In conclusion, novel variants identified in Thailand are unlikely to increase the fitness of SARS-CoV-2. The insights obtained from this study could aid SARS-CoV-2 variants prioritisations and help molecular biologists and virologists working on strain surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic apoptosis is principally governed by the BCL-2 family of proteins, but some non-BCL-2 proteins are also critical to control this process. To identify novel apoptosis regulators, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 library screen, and it identified the mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF5/MITOL/RNF153 as an important regulator of BAK apoptotic function. Deleting MARCHF5 in diverse cell lines dependent on BAK conferred profound resistance to BH3-mimetic drugs. The loss of MARCHF5 or its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity surprisingly drove BAK to adopt an activated conformation, with resistance to BH3-mimetics afforded by the formation of inhibitory complexes with pro-survival proteins MCL-1 and BCL-XL. Importantly, these changes to BAK conformation and pro-survival association occurred independently of BH3-only proteins and influence on pro-survival proteins. This study identifies a new mechanism by which MARCHF5 regulates apoptotic cell death and provides new insight into how cancer cells respond to BH3-mimetic drugs. These data also highlight the emerging role of ubiquitin signalling in apoptosis that may be exploited therapeutically.",

Here we report that fasting slows muscle repair both immediately after the conclusion of fasting as well as after multiple days of refeeding. We show that ketosis, either endogenously produced during fasting or a ketogenic diet, or exogenously administered, promotes a deep quiescent state in muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Although deep quiescent MuSCs are less poised to activate, slowing muscle regeneration, they have markedly improved survival when facing sources of cellular stress. Further, we show that ketone bodies, specifically {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, directly promote MuSC deep quiescence via a non-metabolic mechanism. We show that {beta}-hydroxybutyrate functions as an HDAC inhibitor within MuSCs leading to acetylation and activation of an HDAC1 target protein p53. Finally, we demonstrate that p53 activation contributes to the deep quiescence and enhanced resilience observed during fasting.",

Here we show that Rac is required in all cells of the cluster and promotes follower cell motility. We identify a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Cdep, that also regulates follower cell movement and cluster cohesion. The tumor suppressors Scribble, Discs Large, and Lethal Giant Larva localize Cdep basolaterally and share phenotypes with Cdep. Relocalization of Cdep::GFP partially rescues Scrib knockdown, suggesting that Cdep is a major downstream effector of basolateral proteins.

    "abstract": "The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) coordinates advancement through mitosis via temporally controlled polyubiquitination of effector proteins. Despite the long-appreciated spatial organization of key events in mitosis mediated largely by cytoskeletal networks, the spatial regulation of APC/C, the major mitotic E3 ligase, is poorly understood. Here, we describe a microtubule-resident protein, PLEKHA5, as an interactor of APC/C and spatial regulator of its activity in mitosis. PLEKHA5 knockdown delayed mitotic progression, causing accumulation of APC/C substrates dependent upon the PLEKHA5-APC/C interaction. To assess the spatial importance of this interaction, we developed microtubule-localized proximity biotinylation tools, which revealed that depletion of PLEKHA5 decreased the extent of APC/C association with the microtubule cytoskeleton. This decreased APC/C microtubule-localization in turn prevented efficient loading of APC/C with its co-activator CDC20, leading to defects in E3 ligase catalytic activity. We propose that PLEKHA5 functions as an adaptor of APC/C that promotes its subcellular localization to microtubules and facilitates its activation by CDC20, thus ensuring the timely turnover of key mitotic APC/C substrates and proper progression through mitosis.",

Membrane enrichment in n-3, but not n-6, PUFAs potentiates ligand binding. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the D2R preferentially interacts with n-3 over n-6 PUFAs. Furthermore, even though this mildly affects signalling in heterologous systems, in vivo n-3 PUFA deficiency blunts the effects of D2R ligands. These results suggest that n-3 PUFAs act as allosteric modulators of the D2R and provide a putative mechanism for their potentiating effect on antipsychotic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis, centrosomes serve as microtubule organizing centers that guide the formation of a bipolar spindle. However, oocytes of many species lack centrosomes; how meiotic spindles establish and maintain these acentrosomal poles remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the microtubule polymerase ZYG-9ch-TOG is required to maintain acentrosomal pole integrity in C. elegans oocyte meiosis; following acute depletion of ZYG-9 from pre-formed spindles, the poles split apart and an unstable multipolar structure forms. Depletion of TAC-1, a protein known to interact with ZYG-9 in mitosis, caused loss of proper ZYG-9 localization and similar spindle phenotypes, further demonstrating that ZYG-9 is required for pole integrity. However, depletion of ZYG-9 surprisingly did not affect the assembly or stability of monopolar spindles, suggesting that ZYG-9 is not required for acentrosomal pole structure per se. Moreover, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed that ZYG-9 turns over rapidly at acentrosomal poles, displaying similar turnover dynamics to tubulin itself, suggesting that ZYG-9 does not play a static structural role at poles. Together, these data support a global role for ZYG-9 in regulating the stability of bipolar spindles and demonstrate that the maintenance of acentrosomal poles requires factors beyond those acting to organize the pole structure itself.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged manganese exposure causes manganism, a neurodegenerative movement disorder. The identity of adaptive and non-adaptive cellular processes targeted by manganese remains mostly unexplored. Here we study mechanisms engaged by manganese in genetic cellular models known to increase susceptibility to manganese exposure, the plasma membrane manganese efflux transporter SLC30A10 and the mitochondrial Parkinsons gene PARK2. We found that SLC30A10 and PARK2 mutations as well as manganese exposure compromised the mitochondrial RNA granule as well as mitochondrial transcript processing. These RNA granule defects led to impaired assembly and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Notably, cells that survived a cytotoxic manganese challenge had impaired RNA granule function, thus suggesting that this granule phenotype was adaptive. CRISPR gene editing of subunits of the mitochondrial RNA granule, FASTKD2 or DHX30, as well as pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial transcription-translation, were protective rather than deleterious for survival of cells acutely exposed to manganese. Similarly, adult Drosophila mutants with defects in the mitochondrial RNA granule component scully were safeguarded from manganese-induced mortality. We conclude that the downregulation of the mitochondrial RNA granule function is a protective mechanism for acute metal toxicity.\n\nSignificance StatementMutations in the manganese efflux transporter SLC30A10 and the mitochondrial Parkinsons gene PARK2, cause neurodegeneration and increased susceptibility to toxic manganese exposure. Thus, molecular processes affected in both mutants could offer insight into fundamental mechanisms conferring susceptibility or resilience to environmental and genetic factors associated with neurodegeneration. Here we report that SLC30A10 and PARK2 mutations compromise an understudied structure, the mitochondrial RNA granule, which is required for processing polycistronic mitochondrial RNAs. Cells and Drosophila lacking mitochondrial RNA granule components were resistant to manganese exposure. We conclude that the downregulation of the mitochondrial RNA granule function is an adaptive mechanism for cells exposed to manganese.",

    "abstract": "Colonial tunicates are the only chordates that regularly regenerate a fully functional whole body as part of their asexual life cycle, starting from specific epithelia and/or mesenchymal cells. In addition, in some species, whole-body regeneration (WBR) can also be triggered by extensive injuries, which deplete most of their tissues and organs and leave behind only small fragments of their body.\n\nIn this manuscript, we characterized the onset of WBR in Botryllus schlosseri, one colonial tunicate long used as a laboratory model. We first analyzed the transcriptomic response to a WBR-triggering injury. Then, through morphological characterization, in vivo observations via time-lapse, vital dyes, and cell transplant assays, we started to reconstruct the dynamics of the cells triggering regeneration, highlighting an interplay between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. The dynamics described here suggest that WBR in B. schlosseri is initiated by extravascular tissue fragments derived from the injured individuals rather than particular populations of blood-borne cells, as has been described in closely related species. The morphological and molecular datasets here reported provide the background for future mechanistic studies of the WBR ontogenesis in B. schlosseri and allow to compare it with other regenerative processes occurring in other tunicate species and possibly independently evolved.",

The fused brain organoids were engrafted with robust vascular network-like structures, and exhibited increased number of neural progenitors, in line with the possibility that vessels regulate neural development. Fusion organoids also contained functional blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-like structures, as well as microglial cells, a specific population of immune cells in the brain. The incorporated microglia responded actively to immune stimuli to the fused brain organoids.

    "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) plays a central role in gut physiology and mediating the crosstalk between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and other organs. The human ENS has remained elusive, highlighting the need for an in vitro modeling and mapping blueprint. Here we map out the developmental and functional features of the human ENS, by establishing robust and scalable 2D ENS cultures and 3D enteric ganglioids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). These models recapitulate the remarkable neuronal and glial diversity found in primary tissue and enable comprehensive molecular analyses that uncover functional and developmental relationships within these lineages. As a salient example of the power of this system, we performed in-depth characterization of enteric nitrergic neurons (NO neurons) which are implicated in a wide range of GI motility disorders. We conducted an unbiased screen and identified drug candidates that modulate the activity of NO neurons and demonstrated their potential in promoting motility in mouse colonic tissue ex vivo. We established a high-throughput strategy to define the developmental programs involved in NO neuron specification and discovered that PDGFR inhibition boosts the induction of NO neurons in enteric ganglioids. Transplantation of these ganglioids in the colon of NO neuron-deficient mice results in extensive tissue engraftment, providing a xenograft model for the study of human ENS in vivo and the development of cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative GI disorders. These studies provide a framework for deciphering fundamental features of the human ENS and designing effective strategies to treat enteric neuropathies.",

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes to generate myelin, which is essential for normal nervous system function. OPC differentiation is driven by signaling pathways such as mTOR (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin), which functions in two distinct complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), containing Raptor or Rictor respectively. In the current studies, mTORC2 signaling was selectively deleted from OPCs in PDGFR-Cre X Rictorfl/fl mice. This study examined developmental myelination in male and female mice, comparing the impact of mTORC2 deletion in the corpus callosum and spinal cord. In both corpus callosum and spinal cord, Rictor loss in OPCs resulted in early reduction in myelin RNAs and some myelin proteins. However, these deficits rapidly recovered in spinal cord, where normal myelin abundance and thickness was noted at post-natal day 21 and 1.5 months. By contrast, the losses in corpus callosum resulted in severe hypomyelination, and increased unmyelinated axons. The current studies focus on uniquely altered signaling pathways following mTORC2 loss in developing oligodendrocytes. A major mTORC2 substrate is phospho-Akt-S473, which was significantly reduced throughout development in both corpus callosum and spinal cord at all ages measured, yet this had little impact in spinal cord. Loss of mTORC2 signaling resulted in decreased expression of actin regulators such as gelsolin in corpus callosum, but only minimal loss in spinal cord. The current study establishes a regionally-specific role for mTORC2 signaling in OPCs, particularly in the corpus callosum.\n\nSignificance StatementmTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling have differential impact on myelination in the central nervous system. Numerous studies identify a role for mTORC1, but deletion of Rictor (mTORC2 signaling) in late-stage oligodendrocytes had little impact on myelination in the CNS. However, the current studies establish that deletion of mTORC2 signaling from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells results in reduced myelination of brain axons. These studies also establish a regional impact of mTORC2, with little change in spinal cord in these conditional Rictor deletion mice. Importantly, in both, brain and spinal cord, mTORC2 downstream signaling targets were impacted by Rictor deletion. Yet, these signaling changes had little impact on myelination in spinal cord, while they resulted in long term alterations in myelination in brain.",

    "abstract": "Spermiogenesis, the post-meiotic stage of sperm development, is critical for normal male fertility. Many genetic defects and environmental assaults that affect spermiogenesis have been shown to be associated with male infertility. In addition, this later stage of spermatogenesis has been proposed to be an ideal target for male contraceptive development. The mouse is a widely used model for studying the mechanisms of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. However, due to the complexity and the asynchronous nature of spermatogenesis in adult testis, it is challenging to study molecular processes restricted to this specific developmental stage. It is also challenging to monitor the spermiogenesic activity in live mice, which is critical for screening for fertility-modulating interventions such as contraceptives. Here we reported the development of a Nutm1-T2A-luciferase 2(Luc2)-tandem Tomato(TdTomato) knock-in reporter mouse model that specifically labels post-meiotic spermatids. Homozygous reporter mice are healthy and fully fertile, demonstrating no interference with the normal functions of the Nutm1 gene by the reporter. We demonstrated the visualization of post-meiotic spermatids by fluorescent imaging of the TdTomato reporter in both live and fixed testis tissues. We also demonstrated bioluminescence imaging of Nutm1 expressing cells in live mice. The Nutm1-T2A-Luc2TdTomato reporter mouse can serve as a valuable tool for studying spermiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "During cytokinesis, the intercellular bridge (ICB) connecting the daughter cells experiences pulling forces, which delay abscission by preventing the assembly of the ESCRT scission machinery. Abscission is thus triggered by tension release, but how ICB tension is controlled is unknown. Here, we report that caveolae, which are known to control membrane tension upon mechanical stress in interphase cells, are located at the midbody, at the abscission site and at the ICB/cell interface in dividing cells. Functionally, the loss of caveolae delays ESCRT-III recruitment during cytokinesis and impairs abscission. This is the consequence of a 2-fold increase of ICB tension measured by laser ablation, associated with a local increase in myosin II activity at the ICB/cell interface. We thus propose that caveolae buffer membrane tension and limit contractibility at the ICB to promote ESCRT-III assembly and cytokinetic abscission. Altogether, this work reveals an unexpected connection between caveolae and the ESCRT machinery and the first role of caveolae in cell division.\n\nTEASERCaveolae limit the tension in the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis to enable ESCRT-III assembly and successful abscission.",

    "abstract": "Since SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was reported in November 2021, it has quickly spread to many countries and outcompeted the globally dominant Delta variant in several countries. The Omicron variant contains the largest number of mutations to date, with 32 mutations located at spike (S) glycoprotein, which raised great concern for its enhanced viral fitness and immune escape[1-4]. In this study, we reported the crystal structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Omicron variant S glycoprotein bound to human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.6 [A]. Structural comparison, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation collectively identified four key mutations (S477N, G496S, Q498R and N501Y) for the enhanced binding of ACE2 by the Omicron RBD compared to the WT RBD. Representative states of the WT and Omicron RBD-ACE2 systems were identified by Markov State Model, which provides a dynamic explanation for the enhanced binding of Omicron RBD. The effects of the mutations in the RBD for antibody recognition were analyzed, especially for the S371L/S373P/S375F substitutions significantly changing the local conformation of the residing loop to deactivate several class IV neutralizing antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron1 Variant of Concern (B.1.1.529) has spread rapidly in many countries. With a spike that is highly diverged from that of the pandemic founder, it escapes most available monoclonal antibody therapeutics2,3 and erodes vaccine protection4. A public class of IGHV3-53-using SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies5,6 typically fails to neutralize variants carrying mutations in the receptor-binding motif7-11, including Omicron. As antibodies from this class are likely elicited in most people following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, their subsequent affinity maturation is of particular interest. Here, we isolated IGHV3-53-using antibodies from an individual seven months after infection and identified several antibodies capable of broad and potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, extending to Omicron without loss of potency. By introducing select somatic hypermutations into a germline-reverted form of one such antibody, CAB-A17, we demonstrate the potential for commonly elicited antibodies to develop broad cross-neutralization through affinity maturation. Further, we resolved the structure of CAB-A17 Fab in complex with Omicron spike at an overall resolution of 2.6 [A] by cryo-electron microscopy and defined the structural basis for this breadth. Thus, public SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies can, without modified spike vaccines, mature to cross-neutralize exceptionally antigenically diverged SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Asprosin, the C-terminal furin cleavage product of profibrillin-1, was reported to act as a hormone that circulates at nanomolar levels and is recruited to the liver where it induces G protein-coupled activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway and stimulates rapid glucose release into the circulation. Although derived upon C-terminal cleavage of fibrillin-1, a multidomain extracellular matrix glycoprotein with a ubiquitous distribution in connective tissues, little is known about the mechanisms controlling the bioavailability of asprosin in tissues. In the current view, asprosin is mainly produced by white adipose tissue from where it is released into the blood in monomeric form. Here, by employing newly generated specific asprosin antibodies we monitored the distribution pattern of asprosin in human and murine connective tissues such as placenta, and muscle. Thereby we detected the presence of asprosin positive extracellular fibers. Further, by screening established cell lines for asprosin synthesis we found that most cells derived from musculoskeletal tissues render asprosin into an oligomerized form. Our analyses show that asprosin already multimerizes intracellularly, but that stable multimerization via covalent bonds is facilitated by transglutaminase activity. Further, asprosin fiber formation requires an intact fibrillin-1 fiber network for proper linear deposition. Our data suggest a new extracellular storage mechanism of asprosin in an oligomerized form which may regulate its cellular bioavailability in tissues.",

As DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that affects gene expression, blocking access to S genes through targeted methylation could increase disease resistance. Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. manihotis, the causal agent of cassava bacterial blight (CBB), uses transcription activator-like20 (TAL20) to induce expression of the S gene MeSWEET10a. In this work, we direct methylation to the TAL20 effector binding element within the MeSWEET10a promoter using a synthetic zinc-finger DNA binding domain fused to a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. We demonstrate that this methylation prevents TAL20 binding, blocks transcriptional activation of MeSWEET10a in vivo and that these plants display decreased CBB symptoms while maintaining normal growth and development. This work therefore presents an epigenome editing approach useful for crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) costimulatory domains steer the phenotypic output of therapeutic T cells. In most cases these domains are derived from native immune receptors, composed of signaling motif combinations selected by evolution. To explore if non-natural combinations of signaling motifs could drive novel cell fates of interest, we constructed a library of CARs containing [~]2,300 synthetic costimulatory domains, built from combinations of 13 peptide signaling motifs. The library produced CARs driving diverse fate outputs, which were sensitive to motif combinations and configurations. Neural networks trained to decode the combinatorial grammar of CAR signaling motifs allowed extraction of key design rules. For example, the non-native combination of TRAF- and PLC{gamma}1-binding motifs was found to simultaneously enhance cytotoxicity and stemness, a clinically desirable phenotype associated with effective and durable tumor killing. The neural network accurately predicts that addition of PLC{gamma}1-binding motifs improves this phenotype when combined with TRAF-binding motifs, but not when combined with other immune signaling motifs (e.g. PI3K-or Grb2-binding motifs). This work shows how libraries built from the minimal building blocks of signaling, combined with machine learning, can efficiently guide engineering of receptors with desired phenotypes.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=60 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/474985v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8dbf97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d8300org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1838ba0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143d907_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We demonstrate the ability of MORE in generating biological insights by finding patterns across studies. Our analyses reveal that ORs are tuned to specific ranges of several physicochemical properties of odorants; the empty-neuron recording technique for measuring OR responses is more sensitive than the Xenopus oocyte technique; there are systematic differences in the behavioral preferences reported by different types of assays; and odorants tend to become less attractive or more aversive at higher concentrations.",

Yet, lacunae remain in our understanding of antigen processing/presentation and CD8 T cell response. Given the association of Wnt5A signaling with immune homeostasis, we evaluated the utility of Wnt5A in antigen processing, cross-presentation, and CD8 T cell activation. Using mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells as antigen-presenting cells and ovalbumin as a model antigen we found that Wnt5A mediated regulation of actin and proteasome dynamics is inherently associated with antigen processing. A Wnt5A-Actin-Protasome axis also contributes to antigen cross-presentation and antigen responsive CD8 T cell expansion. In concurrence with these observations, we demonstrated impaired activation of ovalbumin-specific CD8 T cells in ovalbumin immunized Wnt5A heterozygous mice as illustrated by their poor CD8 T cell recall response to ovalbumin when compared to similarly immunized wild type cohorts. Our results suggest that Wnt5A signaling-directed antigen processing/presentation could be vital for generating CD8 T cell recall response to antigen, thus shedding light on a critical parameter of immunity.",

We performed genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) using 2237 clinical strains of Mtb to identify novel genetic factors that evoke drug resistance. In addition to the known direct targets, for the first time, we identified a strong association between the mutations in the DNA repair genes and the multidrug-resistant phenotype. To evaluate the impact of variants identified in the clinical samples in the evolution of drug resistance, we utilized knockouts and complemented strains in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) and Mtb. Results show that variant mutations abrogated the function of MutY and UvrB. MutY variant showed enhanced survival compared with wild-type (Rv) when the Mtb strains were subjected to multiple rounds of ex vivo antibiotic stress. Notably, in an in vivo Guinea pig infection model, the MutY variant outcompeted the wild-type strain. Collectively, we show that novel variant mutations in the DNA repair genes abrogate their function and contribute to better survival under antibiotic/host stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Sex, age, diet, stress, and social environment have all been shown to influence the gut microbiota. In several mammals, including humans, increased stress is related to decreasing gut microbial diversity and may differentially impact specific taxa. Recent evidence from gorillas shows fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentration (FGMC) did not significantly explain gut microbial diversity, but it was significantly associated with the abundance of the family Anaerolineaceae. These patterns have yet to be examined in other primates, like bonobos (Pan paniscus). We compared FGMC to 16S rRNA amplicons for 201 bonobo fecal samples collected across five months to evaluate the impact of stress, measured with FGMC, on the gut microbiota. Alpha diversity measures (Chaos and Shannons indexes) were not significantly related to FGMC. FGMC explained 0.08% of the variation in beta diversity for Jensen-Shannon and 1.27% for weighted UniFrac but was not significant for unweighted UniFrac. We found that genus SHD-231, a member of the family Anaerolinaceae had a significant positive relationship with FGMC. These results suggest that bonobos are relatively similar to gorillas in alpha diversity and family Anaerolinaceae responses to FGMC, but different from gorillas in beta diversity. Members of the family Anaerolinaceae may be differentially affected by FGMC across great apes. FGMC appears to be context dependent and may be species-specific for alpha and beta diversity but this study provides an example of consistent change in two African apes. Thus, the relationship between physiological stress and the gut microbiome may be difficult to predict, even among closely related species.\n\nGraphical Abstract: See PDF\n\nLegend: We compared the bonobo gut microbiota to fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (FGMC).

    "abstract": "The Toxoplasma inner membrane complex (IMC) is a specialized organelle that is crucial for the parasite to establish an intracellular lifestyle and ultimately cause disease. The IMC is composed of both membrane and cytoskeletal components, further delineated into the apical cap, body, and basal subcompartments. The apical cap cytoskeleton was recently demonstrated to govern the stability of the apical complex, which controls parasite motility, invasion, and egress. While this role was determined by individually assessing the apical cap proteins AC9, AC10, and the MAP kinase ERK7, how the three proteins collaborate to stabilize the apical complex is unknown. In this study, we use a combination of deletion analyses and yeast-2-hybrid experiments to establish that these proteins form an essential complex in the apical cap. We show that AC10 is a foundational component of the AC10:AC9:ERK7 complex and demonstrate that the interactions among them are critical to maintain the apical complex. Importantly, we identify multiple independent regions of pairwise interaction between each of the three proteins, suggesting that the AC9:AC10:ERK7 complex is organized by multivalent interactions. Together, these data support a model in which multiple interacting domains enable the oligomerization of the AC9:AC10:ERK7 complex and its assembly into the cytoskeletal IMC, which serves as a structural scaffold that concentrates ERK7 kinase activity in the apical cap.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe phylum Apicomplexa consists of obligate, intracellular parasites including the causative agents of toxoplasmosis, malaria, and cryptosporidiosis. Hallmarks of these parasites are the IMC and the apical complex, both of which are unique structures that are conserved throughout the phylum and required for parasite survival. The apical cap portion of the IMC has previously been shown to stabilize the apical complex. Here, we expand on those studies to determine the precise protein-protein interactions of the apical cap complex that confer this essential function. We describe the multivalent nature of these interactions and show that the resulting protein oligomers likely tether ERK7 in the apical cap. This study represents the first description of the architecture of the apical cap at a molecular level, expanding our understanding of the unique cell biology that drives Toxoplasma infections.",

    "abstract": "Cobalamin (vitamin B12), is a cofactor for crucial metabolic reactions in multiple eukaryotic taxa, including major primary producers such as algae, and yet only prokaryotes can produce it. Many bacteria can colonise the algal phycosphere, forming stable communities that gain preferential access to exudates and in return provide compounds, such as B12. Extended coexistence can then drive gene loss, leading to greater algal-bacterial interdependence. In this study, we investigate how a recently evolved B12-dependent strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, metE7, forms a mutualism with certain bacteria, including the rhizobium Mesorhizobium loti and even a strain of the gut bacterium E. coli engineered to produce cobalamin. Although metE7 was supported by B12 producers, its growth in co-culture was slower than the B12-independent wild-type, suggesting that high bacterial B12 provision may be necessary to favour B12 auxotrophs and their evolution. Moreover, we found that an E. coli strain that releases more B12 makes a better mutualistic partner, and although this trait may be more costly in isolation, greater B12 release provided an advantage in co-cultures. We hypothesise that, given the right conditions, bacteria that release more B12 may be selected for, particularly if they form close interactions with B12-dependent algae.\n\nOriginality-Significance statementMicroalgae are fundamental to the global carbon cycle, and yet despite being photosynthetic they often rely on other organisms for micronutrients. One of these micronutrients is vitamin B12 (cobalamin), which they receive from bacteria. Many environmental studies support the widespread role of B12 in algal-bacterial mutualisms, so here we wished to investigate how these mutualisms may arise evolutionarily by using an experimentally evolved B12-dependent alga and various B12-producers. A B12-producing rhizobium, Mesorhizobium loti, could stably support the B12-dependent Chlamydomonas reinhardtii metE7 strain, and vice versa, but nutrient supplementation increased growth of both species further. metE7 could also be supported by E. coli strains engineered to produce B12, and engineering a strain to release a higher proportion of B12 led to better algal growth, which increased bacterial growth in turn. We suggest that as B12-based mutualisms develop, increased B12 release may be selected for and therefore lead to more productive symbioses.",

    "abstract": "Although water-borne viruses have important implications for the health of humans and other animals, little is known about the impact of human land-use on viral diversity and evolution in water systems such as rivers. We used metagenomic next-generation sequencing to compare the diversity and abundance of viruses at sampling sites along a single river in New Zealand that differed in human land use impact, ranging from pristine to urban. From this we identified 504 putative virus species, of which 97% were novel. Many of the novel viruses were highly divergent, and likely included a new subfamily within the Parvoviridae. We identified at least 63 virus species that may infect vertebrates - most likely fish and water birds - from the Astroviridae, Birnaviridae, Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae. No putative human viruses were detected. Importantly, we observed differences in the composition of viral communities at sites impacted by human land-use (farming and urban) compared to native forest sites (pristine). At the viral species level, the urban sites had higher diversity (327 virus species) than the farming (n=150) and pristine sites (n=119), and more viruses were shared between the urban and farming sites (n=76) than between the pristine and farming or urban sites (n=24). The two farming sites had a lower viral abundance across all host types, while the pristine sites had a higher abundance of viruses associated with animals, plants and fungi. We also identified viruses linked to agriculture and human impact at the river sampling sites in farming and urban areas that were not present at the native forest sites. Overall, our study shows that human land-use can impact viral communities in rivers, such that further work is needed to reduce the impact of intensive farming and urbanization on water systems.",

Hence, Illumina Miseq sequencing was used to identify the genotype of eDNA from wastewater (WW), river water (RW) and stormwater (SW) runoff. High-throughput qPCR targeting 384 genes was implemented to detect extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and mobile genetic elements (eMGEs). We obtained 2,708,291 high quality sequences from 66 eDNA samples. The SW exhibited the significant higher Shannon Index. Subsequently, we identified 34 core bacteria sources of eDNA widely distributed in the three water compartments. Among which, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Limnohabitans, Burkholderiaceae_unclassified, Methylotenera and Acinetobacter were the most prevalent. A total of 302 eARGs and eMGEs were detected, suggesting that eDNA is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir. Among the 127 shared genes of the three groups, 15 core resistance genes were filtered, including IS6100, sul1 NEW, intI1, ISPps1-pseud, aac3-Via, qacH_351 and ISSm2-Xanthob. The Procrustes analysis and Variance Partitioning Analysis (VPA) demonstrated that core bacteria and MGEs were significantly correlated with eARGs. These results suggested that the occurrence and changes of eARGs in the water compartments may be largely attributed to the core microbiota and eMGEs.\n\nSynopsisThe identification of bacterial taxa of extracellular DNA is the preliminary issue for the natural transformation of extracellular antibiotic resistome.",

    "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) is a major regulatory signal during embryogenesis produced from vitamin A (retinol) by an extensive, autoregulating metabolic and signaling network to prevent fluctuations that result in developmental malformations. Xenopus laevis is an allotetraploid hybrid frog species whose genome includes L (long) and S (short) chromosomes from the originating species. Evolutionarily, the X. laevis subgenomes have been losing either L or S homoeologs in about 43% of genes to generate singletons. In the RA network, out of the 47 genes, about 46% have lost one of the homoeologs, like the genome average. In contrast, RA metabolism genes from storage (retinyl esters) to retinaldehyde production exhibit enhanced gene loss with 75% singletons out of 28 genes. The effect of this gene loss on RA signaling autoregulation was studied. Employing transient RA manipulations, homoeolog gene pairs were identified in which one homeolog exhibits enhanced responses or looser regulation than the other, while in other pairs both homoeologs exhibit similar RA responses. CRISPR /Cas9 targeting of individual homoeologs to reduce their activity supports the hypothesis where the RA metabolic network gene loss results in tighter network regulation and more efficient RA robustness responses to overcome complex regulation conditions.",

    "abstract": "Human Mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are promising in regenerative medicine for their multi-lineage differentiation capability. It has been demonstrated that lineage specification is governed by both chemical and mechanical cues. Among all the different mechanical cues known to control hMSCs fate, substrate stiffness is the most well-studied. It has been shown that the naive mesenchymal stem cells when cultured on soft gel, they commit towards adipogenic lineage while on stiff gel they become osteogenic. Soft substrates also cause less cell spreading, less traction, less focal adhesion assembly and stress fibre formation. Furthermore, chromatin condensation increases when cells are cultured on soft substrates. As the nucleus has been postulated to be mechanosensor and mechanotransducer, in this paper we asked the question how mechanosensing and mechanoresponse process will be influenced if we reduce the chromatin condensation in hMSCs cultured on soft substrates by using an external reagent. To address this question, we treated hMSCs cultured on soft polyacrylamide (PA) gels with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) called Valproic Acid (VA) which decondense the chromatin by hyperacetylation of histone proteins. We found that the treatment with VA overrides the effect of soft substrates on hMSCs morphology, cellular traction, nuclear localization of mechnosensory protein YAP (yes-associated protein), and differentiation. VA treated cells behaved as if they are on stiff substrates in all aspects tested here. In contrast, when we increase chromatin condensation using histone acetyl transferase inhibitor (HATi), adipogenic differentiation on soft gel increases. Furthermore, we have shown that VA controls hMSCs differentiation via activation of ERK/MAPK pathway by increasing the p-ERK expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time that inhibiting histone deacetylase can override the mechanoresponse of hMSCs. This work will help us to fundamentally understand the mechanosignalling process and to control the hMSCs differentiation in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.\n\nSignificanceTo harness the clinical potential of Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), it is important to understand the working mechanism of various signals in deciding cell fate. It has been shown in the recent past that the substrate rigidity influence hMSCs differentiation. Though the mechanism is not fully understood, the mechanosignals are known to alter the cell fate via reorganizing the chromatin packing. In this work, we ask if altering chromatin packing can change the cell fate as dictated by the mechanical properties of the substrates. We have shown that almost all the known effector of mechanosignals get modified when we tweak the chromatin packing via histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). This study is helpful for developing a better understanding of the mechano-signalling process. It gives us a tool to override the effect of the substrates, particularly when the mechanical properties of biomaterials are not conducive for the desired differentiation outcome. Additionally, as HDACi are being used in the therapy of cancer and different neurodegenerative diseases, our understanding of their crosstalk with tissue stiffness in controlling cell fate will help to understand any unknown and undesirable side effects of using HDACi as therapeutic agent.",

Here we report the discovery of an enigmatic mechanism for the generation of calcium signals that couple cholinergic input to secretion of hydrated mucus in the human colonic stem cell niche. Mechanistic insights for this study were derived from native human colonic crypts and crypt-like organoids expressing MUC2-mNEON. Importantly, we demonstrate that the human colonic stem cell niche is also a cholinergic niche, and that activation of muscarinic receptors initiates calcium signals at the apical pole of intestinal stem cells and neighbouring crypt-base-goblet-cells. The calcium signal  trigger zone is defined by a microdomain of juxtaposed calcium stores expressing TPC1 and InsP3R3 calcium channels. Co-activation of TPC1 and InsP3R3 is required for generation of cholinergic calcium signals and downstream secretion of hydrated mucus, which culminates in the flushing of the colonic stem cell niche.",

Investigated study for Curcumins chemopreventive mechanism against human malignancies, this research examined the cellular and molecular alterations generated by curcumin modified compound in breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. Oncogenic EGFR and VEGFR2 mutations lead to the formation, invasion, and maintenance of malignant phenotypes in humans, including breast cancer. Studied prognostic markers such as C-myc and Ki67 in breast cancer, and the apoptotic gene as Caspase-3 have been done.\n\nAim of the workThe purpose of this study is to determine the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin nanoparticles and nanocapsules in breast cancer cell lines (MCF7).\n\nMaterials and methodsWe used real-time PCR to assess the expression of the C-myc, Ki67, EGFR, VEGFR2, and Caspase-3 genes in MCF7 cells treated with Curcumin nanoparticles and nanocapsules.\n\nResultsCurcumin nanoparticles and nanocapsules boosted apoptotic cell populations considerably regardless of the nanotechnology used. Additionally, the mRNA expression analysis results indicated that the mechanism activated by curcumin nanocapsules involved the upregulation of the oncogenes EGFR and VEGFR2. In comparison to curcumin nanoparticles, curcumin nanocapsules significantly reduced the expression of Ki67 and c-myc mRNAs in breast cancer cells. The mRNA expression study revealed that curcumin nanocapsules produce an increase in the apoptotic Caspase-3 gene production compared to cells treated with curcumin nanoparticles.\n\nConclusionThis work demonstrates that curcumin nanoparticles created using a novel mechanical process can be employed successfully as an anticancer agent. These findings add to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind curcumin nanocapsules anticancer activity in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "De novo genes are novel genes which emerge from non-coding DNA. Until now, little is known about de novo genes properties, correlated to their age and mechanisms of emergence. In this study, we investigate four properties: introns, upstream regulatory motifs, 5 UTRs and protein domains, in 23135 human proto-genes. We found that proto-genes contain introns, whose number and position correlates with the genomic position of proto-gene emergence. The origin of these introns is debated, as our result suggest that 41% proto-genes might have captured existing introns, as well as the fact that 13.7% of them do not splice the ORF. We show that proto-genes which emerged via overprinting tend to be more enriched in core promotor motifs, while intergenic and intronic ones are more enriched in enhancers, even if the motif TATA is most expressed upstream these genes. Intergenic and intronic 5 UTRs of protogenes have a lower potential to stabilise mRNA structures than exonic proto-genes and established human genes. Finally, we confirm that proto-genes gain new putative domains with age. Overall, we find that regulatory motifs inducing transcription and translation of previously non-coding sequences may facilitate proto-gene emergence. Our paper demonstrates that introns, 5UTRs, and domains have specific properties in proto-genes. We also show the importance of studying proto-genes in relation to their genomic position, as it strongly impacts these properties.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfectious Salmon Anaemia Virus (ISAV) is an Orthomixovirus that currently represents a large problem for salmonid aquaculture worldwide. Prevention and treatment methods are only partially effective. Genetic selection and genome engineering strategies have potential to develop ISAV resistant salmon stocks. However, this requires a detailed understanding of the genomic regulation of ISAV pathogenesis. Here, we used single cell RNA sequencing on a salmonid cell line to provide a high dimensional insight into the transcriptional landscape that underpin host-virus interactions during ISAV infection at the single cell level.\n\nResultsSalmon head kidney 1 (SHK-1) cells were single-cell RNA sequenced before challenge, and at 24h, 48h, and 96h post-ISAV challenge. The results revealed marked changes in the host transcriptome at 48h and 96h post-infection, even in uninfected cells, potentially suggesting paracrine signalling. This paracrine activation of uninfected cells seemed to be unspecific, involving pathways such as mRNA sensing, ubiquitination or proteasome, and also the up-regulation of the mitochondrial ribosome genes. At 24h post infection, cells showed expression signatures consistent with viral entry, with up-regulation of genes such as PI3K, FAK or JNK. At 48h and 96h, infected cells showed a clear anti-viral response, characterised by the expression of IFNA2 or IRF2.\n\nConclusionsThis study has increased our understanding of the cellular response of Atlantic salmon during ISAV infection, and revealed potential host-virus interactions at the cellular level. The results highlight the value of single-cell sequencing to characterise cell culture models of viral infection, and the results can be exploited in future functional studies to increase the resistance of Atlantic salmon to ISAV.",

While the activities of RNA chaperones are well studied with short RNAs, little is known about their global effect on the entire viral transcriptome. Here we used Selective 2'-hydroxyl Acylation Analyzed by Primer Extension and Mutational Profiling (SHAPE-MaP) to systematically examine the secondary structure of the rotavirus transcriptome alone and in the presence of NSP2. Surprisingly, SHAPE-MaP data reveal that despite the well-characterized helix-unwinding activity of NSP2 in vitro, its incubation with rotavirus transcripts does not induce a significant change in the SHAPE reactivities. However, a quantitative analysis of the per nucleotide mutation rate, from which SHAPE reactivities are derived, reveals a global five-fold rate increase in the presence of molar excess of NSP2. Further analysis of the mutation rate in the context of structural classification reveals a larger effect on stems rather than loop elements. Together, these data provide the first experimentally derived secondary structure model of the rotavirus transcriptome and reveal that NSP2 exerts a larger effect on stems, while acting by globally increasing RNA backbone flexibility in a protein concentration-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale activity-based profiling of proteases requires identifying substrates that are specific to each individual protease. However, this process becomes increasingly difficult as the number of target proteases increases because most substrates are promiscuously cleaved by multiple proteases. We introduce a method - Substrate Libraries for Compressed sensing of Enzymes (SLICE) - for selecting complementary sets of promiscuous substrates to compile libraries that classify complex protease samples (1) without requiring deconvolution of the compressed signals and (2) without the use of highly specific substrates. SLICE ranks substrate libraries according to two features: substrate orthogonality and protease coverage. To quantify these features, we design a compression score that was predictive of classification accuracy across 140 in silico libraries (Pearson r = 0.71) and 55 in vitro libraries (Pearson r = 0.55) of protease substrates. We demonstrate that a library comprising only two protease substrates selected with SLICE can accurately classify twenty complex mixtures of 11 enzymes with perfect accuracy. We envision that SLICE will enable the selection of peptide libraries that capture information from hundreds of enzymes while using fewer substrates for applications such as the design of activity-based sensors for imaging and diagnostics.",

We evaluated the effects of local mechanical stimuli on osteocyte lacunar morphometrics in tibial cortical bone from young female mice flown on the Space Shuttle for [~]13 days. We optimized scan parameters, using a laboratory-based submicrometer-resolution X-Ray Microscope, to achieve large [~] 0.3 mm3 fields of view with sufficient resolution ([&ge;] 0.3 m) to visualize and measure thousands of lacunae per scan.

Osteocyte lacunae were altered following microgravity exposure in a region-specific manner: more elongated (+7.0% Stretch) in predominately tensile-loaded bone as compared to those in compressively-loaded regions. In compressively-loaded bone, lacunae formed in microgravity were significantly larger (+6.9% Volume) than in the same region formed on Earth. We also evaluated lacunar heterogeneity (i.e., spatial autocorrelation of lacunar morphometric parameters) via kriging models. These statistical models demonstrated that heterogeneity varied with underlying spatial contributors, i.e. the local mechanical and biological environment. Yet in the absence of gravitational loading, osteocyte lacunae in newly formed bone were larger and were collectively more homogenous than in bone formed on Earth. Overall, this study shows that osteocyte reshape their lacunae in response to changes, or absence, in local mechanical stimuli and different biological environments. Additionally, spatial relationships among osteocytes are complex and necessitate evaluation in carefully selected regions of interest and of large cell populations.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=86 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/474962v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f3cc2aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e0fbbdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1af3f7dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7133b0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Rapid identification of bacteria based on nucleic acid amplification allows dealing with the detection of pathogens in clinical, food, and environmental samples. Amplification product must be detected and analyzed by external devices or integrated complicated optical systems. Here, we developed a solid-state pH electrode based on iridium oxide (IrO2) films to measure released hydrogen ions (H+) from isothermal nucleic acid (NA) amplification of bacterial samples. By recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), we achieved rapid (< 15 min) and sensitive (<30 copies) detection with an accuracy of about 0.03 pH. The RPA-based hydrogen ion sensing assay shows higher specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency as the same polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. We initially used the RPA-based sensor to detect E. coli species in laboratory samples. Among, 27 random laboratory samples of E. coli samples, 6 were found to be DH5alpha, 9 BL21, 3 HB101, 6 TOP10, and 3 JM109. The electrical detection of amplification provides generally applicable techniques for the detection of nucleic acid amplification, enabling molecular diagnostic tests in the field and integrating data transmission to the mobile device. These results can be future developed into an efficient tool for rapid on-site detection of bacterial pathogens in clinical samples.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use diverse immune systems to defend themselves from ubiquitous viruses termed bacteriophages (phages). Many anti-phage systems function by abortive infection to kill a phage-infected cell, raising the question of how they are regulated to avoid cell killing outside the context of infection. Here, we identify a transcription factor associated with the widespread CBASS bacterial immune system, that we term CapW. CapW forms a homodimer and binds a palindromic DNA sequence in the CBASS promoter region. Two crystal structures of CapW suggest that the protein switches from an unliganded, DNA binding-competent state to a ligand-bound state unable to bind DNA. We show that CapW strongly represses CBASS gene expression in uninfected cells, and that phage infection causes increased CBASS expression in a CapW-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, this CapW-dependent increase in CBASS expression is not required for robust anti-phage activity, suggesting that CapW may mediate CBASS activation and cell death in response to a signal other than phage infection. Our results parallel concurrent reports on the structure and activity of BrxR, a transcription factor associated with the BREX anti-phage system, suggesting that CapW and BrxR are members of a family of universal defense signaling proteins.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin accessibility is modulated in a variety of ways to create open and closed chromatin states, both of which are critical for eukaryotic gene regulation. At the single molecule level, how accessibility is regulated in the chromatin fiber composed of canonical or variant nucleosomes is a fundamental question in the field. Here, we developed a single-molecule tracking method where we could analyze thousands of canonical H3 and centromeric variant nucleosomes imaged by high-speed atomic force microscopy. This approach allowed us to investigate how changes in nucleosome dynamics in vitro inform us about chromatin accessibility in vivo. By high-speed atomic force microscopy, we tracked chromatin dynamics in real time and determined the MSD and diffusion constant for the variant centromeric CENP-A nucleosome. Furthermore, an essential kinetochore protein CENP-C reduces the diffusion constant and mobility of centromeric nucleosomes along the chromatin fiber. We subsequently interrogated how CENP-C modulates CENP-A chromatin dynamics in vivo. Overexpressing CENP-C resulted in reduced centromeric transcription and impaired loading of new CENP-A molecules. Thus, changes which alter chromatin accessibility in vitro, also correspondingly alter transcription in vivo. These data suggest a model in which variant nucleosomes encode their own diffusion kinetics and mobility, and where binding partners can suppress or enhance mobility.",

    "abstract": "The orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is a photoactive protein involved in cyanobacterial photoprotection. Here, we report on the functional, spectral and structural characteristics of the peculiar Planktothrix PCC7805 OCP (Plankto-OCP). We show that this OCP variant is characterized by higher photoactivation and recovery rates, and a stronger energy-quenching activity, compared to other OCP studied thus far. We characterize the effect of the functionalizing carotenoid and of his-tagging on these reactions, and identify the time scales on which these modifications affect photoactivation. The presence of a his-tag at the C-terminus has a large influence on photoactivation, thermal recovery and PBS-fluorescence quenching, and likewise for the nature of the carotenoid that additionally affects the yield and characteristics of excited states and the ns-s dynamics of photoactivated OCP. By solving the structures of Plankto-OCP in the ECN- and CAN-functionalized states, each in two closely-related crystal forms, we further unveil the molecular breathing motions that animate Plankto-OCP at the monomer and dimer levels. We finally discuss the structural changes that could explain the peculiar properties of Plankto-OCP.\n\nHighlightsO_LIComplete functional characterization of Synechocystis and Planktothrix OCP\nC_LIO_LIHitherto unknown structures of ECN- and CAN-functionalized Planktothrix OCP\nC_LIO_LIInsights into fs-s timescale photodynamics of ECN- and CAN-functionalized Synechocystis and Planktothrix OCP\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) are a family of immunoglobulin-type lectins that mediate protein-carbohydrate interactions via sialic acids attached to glycoproteins or glycolipids. Most of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs), a major subfamily of rapidly evolving Siglecs, contain a cytoplasmic signaling domain consisting of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) and mediate suppressive signals for lymphoid and myeloid cells. While most CD33rSiglecs are expressed by innate immune cells, such as monocytes and neutrophils, to date, the expression of Siglecs in human T cells has not been well appreciated. In this study, we found that Siglec-5, a member of the CD33rSiglecs, is expressed by most activated T cells upon antigen receptor stimulation. Functionally, Siglec-5 suppresses T cell activation. In support of these findings, we found that Siglec-5 overexpression abrogates antigen receptor induced activation of Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and Activator protein 1 (AP-1). Furthermore, we show that GBS {beta}-protein, a known bacterial ligand of Siglec-5, reduces the production of cytokines and cytolytic molecules by activated primary T cells in a Siglec-5 dependent manner. Our data also show that some cancer cell lines express a putative Siglec-5 ligand(s), and that the presence of soluble Siglec-5 enhances tumor-cell specific T cell activation, suggesting that some tumor cells inhibit T cell activation via Siglec-5. Together, our data demonstrate that Siglec-5 is a previously unrecognized inhibitory T cell immune checkpoint molecule and suggests that blockade of Siglec-5 could serve as a new strategy to enhance anti-tumor T cell functions.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySiglec-5 is a novel checkpoint receptor expressed by activated human T cells that antagonizes TCR mediated activation and suppresses T cell effector functions such as cytokine production.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium sporozoites that are transmitted by blood-feeding female Anopheles mosquitoes invade hepatocytes for an initial round of intracellular replication, leading to the release of merozoites that invade and multiply within red blood cells. Sporozoites and merozoites share a number of proteins that are expressed by both stages, including the Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) and the Rhoptry Neck Proteins (RONs). Although AMA1 and RONs are essential for merozoite invasion of erythrocytes during asexual blood stage replication of the parasite, their function in sporozoites is still unclear. Here we show that AMA1 interacts with RONs in mature sporozoites. By using DiCre-mediated conditional gene deletion in P. berghei, we demonstrate that loss of AMA1, RON2 or RON4 in sporozoites impairs colonization of the mosquito salivary glands and invasion of mammalian hepatocytes, without affecting transcellular parasite migration. Our data establish that AMA1 and RONs facilitate host cell invasion across Plasmodium invasive stages, and suggest that sporozoites use the AMA1-RON complex to safely enter the mosquito salivary glands without causing cell damage, to ensure successful parasite transmission. These results open up the possibility of targeting the AMA1-RON complex for transmission-blocking antimalarial strategies.",

Here, using a novel approach for selectively blocking LTP, we found that eliminating LTP in hippocampal or striatal circuits only produces limited effects on learning and memory. To reconcile the discrepancy between the large physiological effect of blocking LTP and the absent effect on learning, we studied how LTP impacts neuronal computations in the hippocampus using in-vivo Ca2+-imaging. Contrary to current conceptual frameworks, we found that hippocampal CA1-region LTP is not required for accurate representations of space in hippocampal neurons, but rather endows these neurons with reward- and novelty-coding properties. Thus, instead of driving formation of cognitive maps and memory engrams, CA1-region LTP incorporates salience information into cognitive representations.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA novel approach for studying long-term potentiation reveals its surprising and selective role in salience encoding",

    "abstract": "Septins are a family of cytoskeletal proteins that regulate several important aspects of neuronal development. Septin 7 (Sept7) is enriched at the base of dendritic spines in excitatory neurons and mediates both spine formation and spine-synapse maturation. Phosphorylation at a conserved C-terminal tail residue of Sept7 mediates its translocation into the dendritic spine head to allow spine-synapse maturation. The mechanistic basis for postsynaptic stability and compartmentalization conferred by phosphorylated Sept7, however, is not known. We report herein the proteomic identification of Sept7 phosphorylation dependent neuronal interactors. Using Sept7 C-terminal phosphopeptide pulldown and biochemical assays, we show that the 14-3-3 family of proteins specifically interact with Sept7 when phosphorylated at the T426 residue. Biochemically, we validate the interaction between Sept7 and 14-3-3 isoform gamma, and show that 14-3-3 gamma is also enriched in mature dendritic spine head. Further, we demonstrate that interaction of phosphorylated Sept7 with 14-3-3 protects it from dephosphorylation, as expression of a 14-3-3 antagonist significantly decreases phosphorylated Sept7 in neurons. This study identifies 14-3-3 proteins as an important physiological regulator of Sept7 function in neuronal development.",

    "abstract": "Visual perspective taking (VPT), particularly level 2 VPT (VPT2), which allows an individual to understand that the same object can be seen differently by others, is related to the theory of mind (ToM), because both functions require a decoupled representation from oneself. Although previous neuroimaging studies have shown that VPT and ToM activate the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), it is unclear whether common neural substrates are involved in VPT and ToM. To clarify this point, the present study directly compared the TPJ activation patterns of individual participants performing VPT2 and ToM tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging and within-subjects design. VPT2-induced activations were compared with activations observed during a mental rotation task as a control task, whereas ToM-related activities were identified with a standard ToM localizer using false-belief stories. A whole-brain analysis revealed that VPT2 and ToM activated overlapping areas in the posterior part of the TPJ. By comparing the activations induced by VPT2 and ToM in individual participants, we found that the peak voxels induced by ToM were located significantly more anteriorly and dorsally within the bilateral TPJ than those measured during the VPT2 task. We further confirmed that these activity areas were spatially distinct from the nearby extrastriate body area (EBA), visual motion area (MT+), and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) using independent localizer scans. Our findings revealed that VPT2 and ToM have distinct representations, albeit partially overlapping, indicating the functional heterogeneity of social cognition within the TPJ.\n\nSignificance StatementThe temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is consistently activated by social cognitive tasks such as visual perspective taking (VPT) and theory of mind (ToM) tasks. The present study investigated whether VPT and ToM have the same neural substrates within the TPJ using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a within-subjects design. While VPT and ToM tasks activated overlapping areas in the posterior part of the TPJ, the individual peak voxels induced by ToM were located significantly more anteriorly and dorsally compared with those observed during the VPT task. Moreover, they were spatially distinct from the nearby functional modules, such as the extrastriate body area, visual motion area, and posterior superior temporal sulcus. Our findings reveal the heterogeneity of social cognition representation within the TPJ.",

    "abstract": "In new epidemics after the host shift, the pathogens may experience accelerated evolution driven by novel selective pressures. When the accelerated evolution enters a positive feedback loop with the expanding epidemics, the pathogens runaway evolution may be triggered. To test this possibility in COVID-19, we analyze the extensive databases and identify 5 major waves of strains, one replacing the previous one in 2020 - 2021. The mutations differ entirely between waves and the number of mutations continues to increase, from 3-4 to 21-31. The latest wave is the Delta strain which accrues 31 new mutations to become highly prevalent. Interestingly, these new mutations in Delta strain emerge in multiple stages with each stage driven by 6 - 12 coding mutations that form a fitness group. In short, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the oldest to the youngest wave, and from the earlier to the later stages of the Delta wave, is a process of acceleration with more and more mutations. The global increase in the viral population size (M(t), at time t) and the mutation accumulation (R(t)) may have indeed triggered the runaway evolution in late 2020, leading to the highly evolved Alpha and then Delta strain. To suppress the pandemic, it is crucial to break the positive feedback loop between M(t) and R(t), neither of which has yet to be effectively dampened by late 2021. New waves beyond Delta, hence, should not be surprising.",

Next Generation Sequencing technologies provide the capacity to study complex bacterial communities, in which the depth and the bioinformatic tools can influence the results. In this work we explored two different protocols for bacterial classification and abundance evaluation, using 10 bacterial genomes in a simulated sample at different sequencing. Protocol A consisted of metagenome assembly with Megahit and Ray Meta and taxonomic classification with Kraken2 and Centrifuge. In protocol B only taxonomic classification. In both protocols, rarefaction, relative abundance and beta diversity were analyzed. In the protocol A, Megahit had a mean contig length of 1,128 and Ray Meta de 8,893 nucleotides. The number of species correctly classified in all depth assays were 6 out of 10 for protocol A, and 9 out of 10 using protocol B. The rarefaction analysis showed an overestimation of the number of species in almost all assays regardless of the protocol, and the beta diversity analysis results indicated significant differences in all comparisons. Protocol A was more efficient for diversity analysis, while protocol B estimated a more precise relative abundance. Our results do not allow us to suggest an optimal sequencing depth at specie level.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to elucidate the apoptotic activity of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) in a human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in vitro. According to DPPH assay, GLP showed a good antioxidant (IC50 value is 202.4 g/mL). Based on MTT assay, the results showed that GLP inhibits MCF-7 cells proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner (p<0.001). IC50 values of the cytotoxicity of GLP and doxorubin were 110.907 g/mL and 58.206 g/mL respectively. The results from the flow cytometry indicated that GLP could induce apoptotic activity through inducing the up-regulation of the Bax and Caspase-9 and the down-regulation of the BcL-2 in MCF-7 cells. At 2xIC50, GLP increased the early-apoptotic and dead cells of MCF-7 from 18.23% to 34.76% and 8.45% to16.34% respectively. In conclusion, the GLP shows anticancer activity against MCF-7 through preventing the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Our data provide the potential molecular targets in cancer prevention and reveal the key barriers in the current anticancer drugs development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundQuadrivalent Inactivated Vaccine (QIV) is expected to replace Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine (TIV) over time. In Portugal, TIV is free of charge for risk groups, which include older adults. In its turn, QIV - which provides broader protection as it includes an additional lineage B strain - was introduced in Portugal in October 2018, but only from the influenza season 2019/20 was provided free of charge for the risk groups. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of switching from TIV to QIV from the National Health Service perspective in the Portuguese elderly mainland population ([&ge;] 65 years old).\n\nMethodsA decision tree model was developed to compare TIV and QIV, based on Portuguese hospitalization data for the 2015/16 influenza season. The primary health economic outcome under consideration was the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). In addition, a one-Way Sensitivity Analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of model parameters on the ICER; Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis was also carried out to analyze the robustness of the base case results.\n\nResultsThe high cost of QIV (approximately three times the cost of TIV) would lead to a total increment of 5,283,047 {euro}, and the resulting ICER would be 26,403,007{euro}/QALY, mainly above the usual willingness-to-pay threshold.\n\nConclusionsFrom the National Health Service perspective, our findings reveal that QIV is not cost-effective for the Portuguese elderly population due to the high cost. If the QIV costs were the same as the TIV, then QIV would be cost-effective.",

    "abstract": "Citrus is an economically important fruit crop grown in all provinces of Pakistan, while Punjab accounting for 95 percent of total production due to its favorable climate for citrus production. Commercially grown varieties in Pakistan include sweet oranges, grapefruits, Mandarine, Lime, and lemon. The goal of this research was to see how diverse the cultivable bacterial populations are found in citrus cultivars. Out of 90 isolated cultures, 37 endophytic bacterial species and 15 different genera of bacteria were characterized based on morphological, biochemical, and molecular methods from citrus leaves. All the isolated bacteria were subjected to PCR amplification through 16S rDNA followed by sequencing. RDP base classification revealed that class Bacilli has the largest percentage of isolates, whereas class Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Proteobacteria have the lowest percentage among all genotypes used. According to the findings, the phylum Firmicutes contains a common genus (Brevibacterium, 1%; Enterococcus, 6%; Staphylococcus, 7% and Bacillus, 60%). Alpha (Rhizobium) beta (Burkholderia cepacia; Comamonas terigena) gamma Proteobacteria (Enterobacter hermachei (1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%), Proteus mirabilis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%), Psychrobacter pulmonis and Yersinia molalretti (1%) respectively. These results revealed that cultivars of the plants might contribute to the structure and endophytic bacterial communities associated with citrus. Endophytes extracted from leaf samples of different citrus cultivars in Pakistan are reported for the first time. The idea of employing endophytes bacteria to produce enzymes stimulate plant growth, and its purpose as a biological control agent will be investigated in the future.",
