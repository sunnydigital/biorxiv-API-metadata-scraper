    "abstract": "As organisms age, they lose the ability to induce appropriate stress responses, becoming vulnerable to protein toxicity and tissue damage. Neurons can signal to peripheral tissues to induce protective organelle-specific stress responses. Recent work has demonstrated a novel and independent role of glia in inducing such responses. Here, we show that overexpression of heat shock factor 1 (hsf-1) in the four astrocyte-like cephalic sheath cells of C. elegans is sufficient to induce a non-cell autonomous cytosolic unfolded protein response (UPR), also known as the heat shock response (HSR), in distal cells. These animals upregulate the HSR in peripheral cells and have increased lifespan and resistance to heat stress. This glial HSR regulation is independent of the canonical neuronal thermosensory circuit and of known neurotransmitters but is dependent on the small clear vesicle release protein UNC-13. Additionally, HSF-1 and the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 are partially required in peripheral tissues for increase of non-autonomous HSR, lifespan, and thermotolerance. We find that cephalic sheath glial hsf-1 over-expression leads to increased pathogen resistance, which suggests a role for this signaling pathway in immune function.",

    "abstract": "The {varepsilon}4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a high-risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). However, approximately 25%-40% of patients with AD do not carry the APOE{varepsilon}4 allele, and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD are less evident in these individuals. The main objective of this study was to understand better the changes in plasma that may contribute to disease pathogenesis in AD and how APOE{varepsilon}3 and APOE{varepsilon}4 contribute to biomarker profiles in AD. We conducted an in-depth plasma proteomics analysis using intensive depletion of high-abundant plasma proteins using the Agilent multiple affinity removal liquid chromatography (LC) column-Human 14 (Hu14) followed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) technique. In this study, we identified a high number of protein expression alterations in plasma which were found uniquely in APOE{varepsilon}3 and APOE{varepsilon}4 carriers. These differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were associated with several molecular functions, including complement cascade, glycolysis, metabolism, plasma lipoprotein assembly, remodelling, and clearance. In addition to unique changes in both APOE genotypes, many proteins were also dysregulated in the presence of both APOE{varepsilon}3 and APOE{varepsilon}4 genotypes depicting the involvement of these proteins in the pathogenesis of AD regardless of the APOE genotypes. We also compared the plasma proteomes of{varepsilon} 4 and{varepsilon} 3 carriers in normal controls, which provided insight into factors that may provide protection from progression to AD despite the presence of the{varepsilon} 4 allele. Furthermore, our findings also identified some proteins previously discovered in AD CSF and brain proteomics signatures that could provide clinically meaningful information.",

    "abstract": "We consider the possibility of applying game theory to analysis and modeling of neurobiological systems. Specifically, the basic properties and features of information asymmetric signaling games are considered and discussed as having potential to explain diverse neurobiological phenomena at levels of biological function that include gene regulation, molecular and biochemical signaling, cellular and metabolic function, as well as the neuronal action potential discharge that can represent cognitive variables such as memory and purposeful behavior. We begin by arguing that there is a pressing need for conceptual frameworks that can permit analysis and integration of information and explanations across the many scales of diverse levels of biological function. Developing such integrative frameworks is crucial if we are to understand cognitive functions like learning, memory, and perception. The present work focuses on systems level neuroscience organized around the connected brain regions of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These areas are intensely studied in rodent subjects as model neuronal systems that undergo activity-dependent synaptic plasticity to form and represent memories and spatial knowledge used for purposeful navigation. Examples of cognition-related spatial information in the observed neuronal discharge of hippocampal place cell populations and medial entorhinal head-direction cell populations are used to illustrate possible challenges to information maximization concepts. It may be natural to explain these observations using the ideas and features of information asymmetric signaling games.",

While immunomodulatory potential of LAG3 is being actively explored in cancer and autoimmunity fields, there is no information on how this pathway affects alloreactive immune responses following organ transplantation. The goal of this study was to investigate the functions of recipient LAG3 in a mouse model of renal allograft rejection. We found that mice deficient in LAG3 expression have elevated heterologous immunity against a panel of alloantigens prior to transplantation. Recipient LAG3 deficiency results in rapid rejection of MHC-mismatched renal allografts that are spontaneously accepted by WT recipients, with graft histology characteristic of antibody mediated rejection (ABMR). Depletion of recipient B cells but not CD8+ T cells significantly extended kidney allograft survival in LAG3-/- recipients further supporting ABMR as the main mechanism of graft loss. Treatment of WT recipients with an antagonistic LAG3 antibody enhanced anti-donor immune responses and induced kidney damage associated with chronic rejection. The experiments using conditional LAG3 knockout recipients demonstrated that LAG3 expression on either T or B cells is sufficient to regulate anti-donor humoral immunity. These results are the first to identify LAG3 as a regulator of both T and B cell responses to kidney allografts and a potential therapeutic target for ABMR prevention and treatment.",

Over 100 serotypes have been described to date but except for the EV-A71, there are no available vaccines or therapeutics against NPEVs. Efforts towards rationally designed pan-NPEV vaccines would greatly benefit from structural biology methods for rapid and comprehensive evaluation of vaccine candidates and elicited antibody responses. Towards this goal, we tested if electron-microscopy-based polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM), a method where structural analysis is performed using serum-derived polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), can be applied to an NPEV. EMPEM was performed on immune complexes featuring CV-A21 viral particles and CV-A21-specific pAbs isolated from mice. Notably, this is the first example of structural analysis of polyclonal immune complexes comprising whole virions. We introduce a data processing workflow that allows reconstruction of different pAbs at near-atomic resolution. The analysis resulted in identification of several antibodies targeting two immunodominant epitopes, near the 3-fold and 5-fold axis of symmetry; the latter overlapping with the receptor binding site. These results demonstrate that EMPEM can be applied to map broad-spectrum polyclonal immune responses against intact virions and define potentially cross-reactive epitopes.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are proteins that act as the sentinels of mammalian cells by detecting bacteria and viruses motifs such as the phospholipid lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacterial membrane, among others. Bacteria like Vibrio cholerae, when grow in phosphate-depleted medium are unable to produce LPS and other phospholipids and therefore increase the synthesis of ornithine lipids (OLs) to keep membrane integrity and survival. We found that, although the huge structural differences between OL and LPS, our immune system is still able to detect OL and trigger immune response through TLR4 and the non-canonical Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing pyrin protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Similar to LPS, OL induced TLR4-dependent tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- secretion and Nuclear Factor (NF)-{kappa}B activation and therefore also elicited the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

    "abstract": "The evolutionarily successful poxviruses possess effective and diverse strategies to circumvent or overcome host defense mechanisms. Poxviruses encode many immunoregulatory proteins to evade host immunity to establish a productive infection and have unique means of inhibiting DNA sensing-dependent type 1 interferon (IFN-I) responses, a necessity given their dsDNA genome and exclusively cytoplasmic life cycle. We found that the key DNA sensing inhibition by poxvirus infection was dominant during the early stage of poxvirus infection before DNA replication. In an effort to identify the poxvirus gene products which subdue the antiviral proinflammatory responses (e.g., IFN-I response), we investigated the function of one early gene that is the known host range determinant from the highly conserved poxvirus host range C7L superfamily, myxoma virus (MYXV) M062. Host range factors are unique features of poxviruses that determine the species and cell type tropism. Almost all sequenced mammalian poxviruses retain at least one homologue of the poxvirus host range C7L superfamily. In MYXV, a rabbit-specific poxvirus, the dominant and broad-spectrum host range determinant of the C7L superfamily is the M062R gene. The M062R gene product is essential for MYXV infection in almost all cells tested from different mammalian species and specifically inhibits the function of host Sterile  Motif Domain-containing 9 (SAMD9), as M062R-null ({Delta}M062R) MYXV causes abortive infection in a SAMD9-dependent manner. In this study we investigated the immunostimulatory property of the {Delta}M062R. We found that the replication-defective {Delta}M062R activated host DNA sensing pathway during infection in a cGAS-dependent fashion and that knocking down SAMD9 expression attenuated proinflammatory responses. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses showed a unique feature of the host gene expression landscape that is different from the dsDNA-stimulated inflammatory state. This study establishes a link between the anti-neoplastic function of SAMD9 and the regulation of innate immune responses.\n\nAuthor SummaryPoxviruses encode a group of genes called host range determinants to maintain or expand their host tropism. The mechanism by which many viral host range factors function remains elusive. Some host range factors possess immunoregulatory functions responsible for evading or subduing host immune defense mechanisms. Most known immunoregulatory proteins encoded by poxviruses are dispensable for viral replication in vitro. The uniqueness of MYXV M062R is that it is essential for viral infection in vitro and belongs to one of the most conserved poxvirus host range families, the C7L superfamily. There is one known host target of the MYXV M062 protein, SAMD9. SAMD9 is constitutively expressed in mammalian cells and exclusively present in the cytoplasm and has an anti-neoplastic function. Humans with deleterious mutations in SAMD9 present disease that ranges from lethality at a young age to a predisposition to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that often require bone marrow transplantation. More importantly, SAMD9 serves as an important antiviral intrinsic molecule to many viruses. The cellular function of SAMD9 remains unclear mostly due to the difficulty of studying this protein, i.e., its large size, long half-life, and its constitutive expression in most cells. In this study we used M062R-null MYXV as a tool to study SAMD9 function and report a functional link between SAMD9 and the regulation of the proinflammatory responses triggered by cGAS-dependent DNA sensing.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms affect the progression and severity of bacterial infections including those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain largely elusive. Following advances in our understanding of the role of replication of S. pneumoniae within a specific subset of splenic macrophages, we sought to investigate events within the spleen that correlate with differential outcomes of invasive pneumococcal infection. Utilising murine invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) models, here we report that infection during the murine active phase (zeitgeber time; 15h after start of light cycle, 3h after start of dark cycle) resulted in significantly faster onset of moderate septicaemia compared to rest phase (zeitgeber time 3; 3h after start of light cycle) infection. These findings correlated with significantly higher pneumococcal burden within the spleen of active phase-infected mice at early time points compared to rest phase-infected mice. Whole-section confocal microscopy analysis of these spleens revealed that the number of pneumococci is significantly higher exclusively within marginal zone metallophilic macrophages (MMMs), known to allow intracellular pneumococcal replication as a prerequisite step to the onset of septicaemia. Pneumococcal clusters within MMMs were more abundant and increased in size in active phase-infected mice compared to those in rest phase-infected mice which decreased in size over time and were present in a lower percentage of MMMs. This phenomenon preceded significantly higher levels of bacteraemia alongside serum IL-6 and TNF- concentrations in active phase-infected mice following re-seeding of pneumococci into the blood. In summary, these data link the difference in susceptibility to invasive pneumococcal infection to variation in the ability of MMMs to successfully control and digest phagocytosed bacteria.\n\nAuthor summaryCircadian rhythms are present within the majority of multicellular organisms and influence almost all aspects of our physiology. As such, circadian rhythm disorders have been shown to result in an increased susceptibility to certain diseases. The effects of host circadian rhythm have been also mirrored in rodent studies, with the outcome of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection being dependent on the time of challenge. Whilst studies into the functional effects of circadian rhythm on the host immune system are present, knowledge of how these contribute to the control of invasive S. pneumoniae infection are lacking, especially considering the recent breakthrough in understanding the stages of pneumococcal pathogenesis. We show here that mice infected with S. pneumoniae during their active phase developed septicaemia quicker than those infected during their rest phase. We demonstrate that this is likely due to increased replication of pneumococci specifically within a subset of splenic macrophages, which subsequently results in increased numbers of pneumococci in the blood and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which result in septicaemia. These data provide novel insights into how circadian rhythm influences the immune functionality of the spleen, and how the regulation of function of one macrophage subtype can significantly alter the course of infection.",

    "abstract": "Using budding yeast, we have studied Rad51-dependent break-induced replication (BIR), where the invading 3 end of a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) and a donor template share 108 bp of homology that can be easily altered. When every 10th base is mismatched between donor and recipient, BIR is 44% efficient compared to fully homologous sequences; but BIR still occurs about 10% when every 6th base is mismatched. Here we explore the tolerance of mismatches in more detail, by examining donor templates that each carry 10 mismatches, but where they are clustered with spacings of every 6th bp. These different arrangements of uneven mismatch distribution were in general less efficient in recombination as templates with evenly distributed mismatches. A donor with all 10 mismatches clustered every 6th base at the 3 invading end of the DSB was not impaired compared to the case where mismatches were clustered at the 5 end. These data suggest that the efficiency of strand invasion is principally dictated by thermodynamic considerations, i.e., by the total number of base pairs that can be formed; but sequence-specific factors are also important. Mismatches in the donor template are incorporated into the BIR product in a strongly polar fashion up to ~40 nucleotides from the 3 end. Mismatch incorporation depends on the 3 [-&gt;] 5 proofreading exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase {delta}, with little contribution from Msh2/Mlh1 mismatch repair proteins. Surprisingly, the probability of a mismatch 27 nt from the 3 end being replaced by donor sequence was the same whether the preceding 26 nucleotides were mismatched every 6th base or fully homologous. These data suggest that DNA polymerase {delta} \"chews back\" the 3 end of the invading strand without any mismatch-dependent cues from the strand invasion structure.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most lethal forms of DNA damage and inaccurate repair of these breaks presents a serious threat to genomic integrity and cell viability. Break-induced replication (BIR) is a homologous recombination pathway that results in a nonreciprocal translocation of chromosome ends. We used budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate Rad51-mediated BIR, where the invading 3 end of the DSB and a donor template share 108 bp of homology. We examined the tolerance of differently distributed mismatches on a homologous donor template and found that BIR efficiency was the same whether the mismatches were clustered at the 3 invading end or at the 5 end. We confirmed that mismatches are incorporated into the BIR product in a strongly polar fashion as far as about 40 nucleotides from the 3 end. We conclude that the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase {delta} \"chews back\" the 3 end of the invading strand even when the sequences removed have no mismatches for the first 26 nucleotides. These observations enrich our understanding of the details of Rad51-mediated strand invasion and provide insight into the mechanism of the 3 to 5 proofreading activity of DNA polymerase during homologous recombination.",

We recently showed that in plants, miRNA biogenesis is also a cotranscriptional event. Here, we report that Arabidopsis PRP40, the U1 snRNP auxiliary protein, positively regulates the recruitment of SE, the core component of the plant microprocessor, to miRNA genes. The association of DCL1, the microprocessor endoribonuclease, with chromatin was altered in prp40ab mutant plants. Impaired cotranscriptional microprocessor assembly was accompanied by RNA polymerase II accumulation at miRNA genes and retention of miRNA precursors at their transcription sites in the prp40ab mutant plants.

    "abstract": "All lentiviruses encode an accessory protein Rev, whose main biological function is to mediate the nuclear export of unspliced and incompletely spliced viral transcripts by binding to a viral cis-acting element (termed the Rev-responsive element, RRE) that is located within env-encoding region. Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a member of the Lentivirus genus in the Retroviridae family, and is considered an important model for the study of lentivirus pathogenesis. Here, we identified a novel transcript from the EIAV genome that encodes a viral protein, named Mat, with unknown function. The transcript mat is fully spliced and comprises parts of the coding regions of MA and TM. Interestingly, the expression of Mat depends on Rev and the CRM1 pathway. Rev could specifically bind to Mat mRNA to promote its nuclear export. We further identified that the first exon of Mat mRNA, which is located within the Gag-encoding region, acts as an unreported RRE. Altogether, we identified a novel fully spliced transcript mat with an unusual RRE, which interacts with Rev for nuclear export through the CRM1 pathway. Our findings may help to expend the understanding of gene transcription and expression of lentivirus.\n\nAuthor summaryIn lentiviruses, the nuclear export of viral transcripts is an important step in controlling viral gene expression. Generally, the unspliced and incompletely spliced (that is, intron-containing) transcripts are exported via the CRM1-dependent export pathway in a process mediated by the viral Rev protein by binding to the Rev-responsive element (RRE) located within the Env-coding region. However, the completely spliced (intronless) transcripts are exported via an endogenous cellular pathway which is Rev independent. Here we identified a novel intronless transcript from EIAV and demonstrated that it encodes a viral protein, termed Mat. Interestingly, we have determined that the expression of Mat depends on Rev, and identified that the first exon of Mat mRNA could specifically bind to Rev and be exported to the cytoplasm, which suggests that first exon of Mat mRNA is a second RRE of EIAV. These findings update the EIAV genome structure and highlight the diversification of post-transcriptional regulation patterns in EIAV, and provides important insights into the Rev-dependent nuclear export of completely spliced transcripts in lentiviruses.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) in the intervertebral disc (IVD), lung and artery are thought to undergo the age-dependant accumulation of damage by chronic exposure to mechanisms such as reactive oxygen species, proteases and glycation. It is unknown whether this damage accumulation is species-dependant (via differing lifespans and hence cumulative exposures) or whether it can influence the progression of age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis. Peptide location fingerprinting (PLF) is a new proteomic analysis method, capable of the non-targeted identification of structure-associated changes within proteins. Here we applied PLF to publicly available ageing human IVD (outer annulus fibrosus), ageing mouse lung and human arterial atherosclerosis datasets and identified novel target proteins alongside common age-associated differences within protein structures which were conserved between tissue regions, organs, sexes and species and in age-related disease. We identify peptide yield differences across protein structures which coincide with biological regions, potentially reflecting the functional consequences of ageing or atherosclerosis for macromolecular assemblies (collagen VI and fibrin), enzyme/inhibitor activity (cathepsin B and alpha-2 macroglobulin), activation states (complement C3 and thrombin) and interaction states (laminins, perlecan, fibronectin, filamin-A, collagen XIV and apolipoprotein-B). Furthermore, we show that alpha-2 macroglobulin, prothrombin, collagen XIV and apolipoprotein-B all exhibit possible shared structural consequences in IVD ageing and arterial atherosclerosis, providing novel links between an age-related disease and intrinsic ageing. Crucially, we also demonstrate that fibronectin, laminin beta chains and filamin-A all exhibit conserved age-associated structural differences between mouse lung and human IVD, providing evidence that ECM, and their associating proteins, may be subjected to potentially similar mechanisms or consequences of ageing across species, irrespective of differences in lifespan and tissue function.",

Xylosides are chemicals which compete with the xylose at the enzyme xylosyl transferase to prevent the attachment of GAG chains to proteins. These compounds have been employed at concentrations in the millimolar range as tools to study the role of GAG chains in proteoglycan function. In the course of our studies with xylosides, we conducted a dose-response curve for xyloside actions on neural cells. To our surprise, we found that concentrations of xylosides in the nanomolar to micromolar range had major effects on cell morphology. These effects are due to changes in cytoskeletal dynamics. Concentrations of xylosides which were effective in altering morphology did not alter GAG chain synthesis rates, nor did they produce any changes in gene expression as determined by RNAseq of treated cells. These observations support a novel action of xylosides on neuronal cells.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase, the enzyme capable of elongating telomeres, is usually restricted in human somatic cells, which contributes to progressive telomere shortening with cell-division and ageing. Using the zebrafish model, we show that subsets gut immune cells have telomerase-dependent \"hyper-long\" telomeres, which we identified as being predominantly macrophages and dendritics (mpeg1.1+ and cd45+mhcII+). Notably, mpeg+ macrophages have much longer telomeres in the gut than in their haematopoietic tissue of origin, suggesting that there is a gut-specific modulation of telomerase in these cells.\n\nMoreover, we show that a subset of gut mpeg+ cells express telomerase (tert) in young WT zebrafish, but that the relative proportion of these cells decreases with ageing. Importantly, this is accompanied by telomere shortening and DNA damage responses with ageing and a telomerase-dependent decrease in expression of autophagy and immune activation markers. Finally, these telomerase-dependent molecular alterations are accompanied by impaired phagocytosis of E.coli and increased gut permeability in vivo. Together, our data show that limiting levels of telomerase lead to changes in gut immunity and gut permeability, which, together, are likely contributors to local and systemic tissue degeneration and increased susceptibility to infection with ageing.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478480v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@141a6caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12d24baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c64267org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@319449_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Our data show that limiting levels of telomerase contribute to alterations in gut immunity, namely increased apoptosis, decreased autophagy and immune activation of mpeg+ macrophages in the gut.

However, the biological mechanisms that connect circadian disruption and cancer risk remain largely undefined. We demonstrate that exposure to chronic circadian disruption (chronic jetlag, CJL) increases tumor burden in a mouse model of KRAS-driven lung cancer. Molecular characterization of tumors and tumor-bearing lung tissues revealed that CJL enhances the expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) target genes. Consistently, exposure to CJL disrupted the highly rhythmic nuclear trafficking of HSF1 in the lung, resulting in an enhanced accumulation of HSF1 in the nucleus. HSF1 has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in other systems, and we find that pharmacological inhibition of HSF1 reduces the growth of KRAS-mutant human lung cancer cells. These findings implicate HSF1 as a molecular link between circadian disruption and enhanced tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Environmental temperature is a key driver of malaria transmission dynamics. Using detailed temperature records from four sites (1800-3200m) in the western Himalaya, we model how temperature regulates parasite development rate (the inverse of the extrinsic incubation period, EIP) in the wild. Using a Briere parametrization of the EIP, combined with Bayesian parameter inference, we study the thermal limits of transmission for avian (P. relictum) and human Plasmodium parasites (P. vivax and P. falciparum) as well as for two malaria-like avian parasites, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon. We demonstrate that temperature conditions can substantially alter the incubation period of parasites at high elevation sites (2600-3200m) leading to restricted parasite development or long transmission windows. We then compare estimates of EIP based on measures of mean temperature versus hourly temperatures to show that EIP days vary in cold versus warm environments. We found that human Plasmodium parasites experience a limited transmission window at 2600m. In contrast, for avian Plasmodium transmission was not possible between September to March at 2600m. In addition, temperature conditions suitable for both Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon transmission were obtained from June to August and in April, at 2600m. Finally, we use temperature projections from a suite of climate models to predict that by 2040, high elevation sites (~ 2600 m) will have a temperature range conducive for malaria transmission, albeit with a limited transmission window. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for fine-scale thermal effects in the expansion of the range of the malaria parasite with global climate change.",

In particular, the study of life history traits related to reproduction could help to resolve the speciation patterns in the cryptic species complexes recently found in earthworms. Here, we carried out a parentage analysis in such a complex, the Allolobophora chlorotica aggregate. Using four nuclear microsatellite markers and a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene we investigated (i) the mating strategies between individuals belonging to two divergent mitochondrial lineages (L2 and L3) that cannot be distinguished with nuclear markers and (ii) the reproductive isolation between lineages that are differentiated both at the mitochondrial and nuclear level (L2/L3 and L1). Among the 157 field collected individuals, 66 adults were used in cross-breeding experiments to form 22 trios based on their assignment to a mitochondrial lineage, and 453 obtained juveniles were genotyped. We showed that adults that mated with both their potential mates in the trio produced significantly more juveniles. In L2 and L3 crosses, a sex-specific pattern of reproduction characteristic to each lineage was observed, suggesting a possible conflict of interest between mating partners. In L2/L3 and L1 crosses, a high production of cocoons was counterbalanced by a low hatching rate, suggesting a post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Reproductive strategies are thus likely to contributed to the diversification of this complex of species and we advocate further studies on sexual selection and sex allocation in earthworms.",

    "abstract": "The genetics of pigmentation is an excellent model for understanding gene interactions in a trait almost entirely unaffected by environment. We have analysed pigmentation phenotypes in UK Biobank using DISSECT, a tool which enables genome-wide association studies (GWAS) whilst accounting for relatedness between individuals, and thus allows a much larger cohort to be studied. We have increased the number of candidate genes associated with red and blonde hair colour, basal skin colour and tanning response to UV radiation. As previously described, we find almost all red hair individuals have two variant MC1R alleles; exome sequence data expands the number of associated coding variants. Rare red-headed individuals with only a single MC1R variant are enriched for an associated eQTL at the ASIP gene. We find that females are most likely to self-report red or blonde hair, paler skin and less tanning ability than men, and that variants at KITLG, MC1R, OCA2 and IRF4 show significant sex differences in effect. After taking sex into account, pigmentation phenotypes are not correlated with sex hormone levels, except for tanning ability, which shows a positive correlation with testosterone in men. Across the UK there is a correlation between place of birth and hair colour; red hair being more common in the north and west, whilst blonde hair is more common in the east. Combining GWAS with transcriptome data to generate a transcriptome wide association study identifies candidate genes whose expression in skin or melanocytes shows association with pigmentation phenotypes. A comparison of candidates associated with different pigmentation phenotypes finds that candidates for blonde hair, but not skin colour, are enriched for skin and hair genes suggesting that it may be hair shape and structure that impacts hair colour, rather than the melanocyte/keratinocyte interaction.",

There have been many studies conducted across multiple different species regarding coordinating abilities. These studies aim to provide data which will help illuminate the evolutionary origins of cooperative problem solving and coordination. However, it is impossible to make firm conclusions about the evolutionary origins of coordinating abilities without a thorough comparative analysis of the existing data. Furthermore, there may be certain aspects of the literature that make it very difficult to confidently address evolutionary and meta-analytic questions. This study aimed to rectify this by using meta-analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and systematic review to analyse the data already obtained across multiple studies, and to assess the reliability of this data. We found that many studies did not provide the information necessary for meta analysis, or were not comparable enough to other studies to be included in analyses, meaning meta analyses were underpowered or could not be conducted due to low samples of both studies and different species. Overall, we found that many studies reported small positive effects across studies, but the standard errors of these effects frequently traversed zero.",

    "abstract": "During their maturation from horizontal basal stem cells, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are known to select exactly one out of hundreds of olfactory receptors (ORs) and express it on their surface, a process called monogenic selection. Monogenic expression is preceded by a multigenic phase during which several OR genes are expressed in a single OSN. Here, we perform pseudotime analysis of a single cell RNA-Seq dataset of murine olfactory epithelium to precisely align the multigenic and monogenic expression phases with the cell types occurring during OSN differentiation. In combination with motif analysis of OR gene cluster-associated enhancer regions, we identify known and novel transcription (co-)factors (Ebf1, Lhx2, Ldb1, Fos and Sspp2) and chromatin remodelers (Kdm1a, Eed and Zmynd8) associated with OR expression. The inferred temporal order of their activity suggests novel mechanisms contributing to multigenic OR expression and monogenic selection.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsFibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare, difficult-to-treat liver cancer primarily affecting pediatric and adolescent patients, and for which precision medicine approaches have historically not been possible. The DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion was identified as a driver of FLC pathogenesis. We aimed to assess whether FLC tumors maintain dependency on this gene fusion and determine if PRKACA is a viable therapeutic target.\n\nMethodsFLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) shRNA cell lines were implanted subcutaneously into female NOD-SCID mice and tumors were allowed to develop prior to randomization to doxycycline (to induce knockdown) or control groups. Tumor development was assessed every 2 days. To assess the effect of treatment with novel selective PRKACA small molecule kinase inhibitors, BLU0588 and BLU2864, FLC PDX tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into NOD-SCID mice and tumors allowed to develop. Mice were randomized to treatment (BLU0588 and BLU2864, orally, once daily) or control groups and tumor size determined as above.\n\nResultsKnockdown of DNAJB1-PRKACA reversed a FLC-specific gene signature and reduced PDX tumor growth in mice compared to the control group. Furthermore, FLC PDX tumor growth was significantly reduced with BLU0588 and BLU2864 treatment versus control (P = 0.003 and P = 0.0005, respectively).\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated, using an inducible knockdown and small molecule approaches, that FLC PDX tumors were dependent upon DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion activity. In addition, this study serves as a proof-of-concept that PRKACA is a viable therapeutic target for FLC and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Ocimum sanctum is a multipurpose herb with highly significant medicinal properties. An in vitro direct regeneration protocol for propagation of a valuable medicinal plant Ocimum sanctum, using petiole explants has been successfully developed. The protocol employed regeneration of shoots directly, without any intervening callus using Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium fortified with 3 mg L-1 BAP + 1 mg L-1 NAA. The maximum regeneration frequency of 98% with 9.6 shoots per explants was achieved. Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated genetic transformation (ATMT) protocol (transient and stable) was established using LBA4404 strain harboring pBI121 with uid-A reporter gene and neomycin phosphotransferase (npt-II) as selection marker. The putative transformants were screened on MS with 50 mg L-1 kanamycin and subsequently rooted on the half-strength MS medium. The confirmation was done via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using npt-II and gus-A gene-specific primers. The maximum stable transformation frequency 70% {+/-} 0.35. Thus, it is apparent that the established in vitro direct regeneration and ATMT method was suitable for integrating novel genes and modulating the metabolic flux for obtaining desired agronomic trait in planta.",

    "abstract": "Melon (Cucumis melo L.) has emerged as an alternative model to study fruit ripening due to the coexistence of climacteric and non-climacteric varieties. The previous characterization of a major QTL ETHQV8.1 sufficient to trigger climacteric ripening in a non-climacteric background allowed the identification within the QTL interval of a negative regulator of ripening CmCTR1-like (MELO3C024518), and a putative DNA demethylase CmROS1 (MELO3C024516), the orthologue of DML2, a DNA demethylase regulating fruit ripening in tomato. To understand the role of these genes in climacteric ripening, we generated homozygous CRISPR knockout mutants of CmCTR1-like and CmROS1 in a climacteric genetic background. The climacteric behavior was altered in both loss-of-function mutants in two summer seasons with an advanced ethylene production profile compared to the climacteric wild type, suggesting a role of both genes in climacteric ripening in melon. Single cytosine methylome analyses of the CmROS1 knockout mutant revealed DNA methylation changes in the promoter regions of key ripening genes as ACS1, ETR1 and ACO1, and ripening associated-transcription factors as NAC-NOR, RIN and CNR, suggesting the importance of CmROS1-mediated DNA demethylation for triggering fruit ripening in melon.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDysregulation of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis and course of many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinsons disease (PD). However, the functionally relevant miRNAs remain largely unknown. Previous meta-analyses on differential miRNA expression data in post-mortem PD brains have highlighted several miRNAs showing consistent and statistically significant effects. However, these meta-analyses were based on exceedingly small sample sizes.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we quantified the expression of the four most compelling PD candidate miRNAs from these meta-analyses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) of one of the largest case-control post-mortem brain datasets available (261 samples), thereby quadruplicating previously investigated sample sizes. Furthermore, we probed for common differential miRNA expression signatures with Alzheimers disease (AD) by also analyzing these miRNAs in post-mortem STG of 190 AD patients and controls and by testing six top AD miRNAs in the PD brains.\n\nResultsOf all ten analyzed miRNAs, PD candidate miRNA homo sapiens (hsa-) miR-132-3p showed evidence for differential expression in both PD (p=4.89E-06) and AD (p=3.20E-24), and AD miRNAs hsa-miR-132-5p (p=4.52E-06) and hsa-miR-129-5p (p=0.0379) showed evidence for differential expression in PD. Combining these novel data with previously published data substantially improved the statistical support (=3.85E-03 using Bonferroni correction) of the corresponding meta-analyses clearly and compellingly implicating these miRNAs in both PD and AD. Furthermore, hsa-miR-132-3p/-5p (but not hsa-miR-129-5p) showed association with neuropathological Braak PD staging (p=3.51E-03/p=0.0117), suggesting that these miRNAs may play a role in -synuclein aggregation beyond the early disease phase.\n\nConclusionsOur study represents the largest independent assessment of recently highlighted candidate brain miRNAs in PD and AD post-mortem brain samples, to date. Our results implicate hsa-miR-132-3p/-5p and hsa-miR-129-5p to be differentially expressed in both PD and AD brains, potentially pinpointing shared pathogenic mechanisms across these neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of physical activity represents an important intervention that may delay, slow, or prevent mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimers disease (AD). One mechanism proposed to underlie the beneficial effect of physical exercise involves the apparent stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). BCI-838 is a pro-drug whose active metabolite BCI-632 is an antagonist at the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3). We previously demonstrated that administration of BCI-838 to a mouse model of cerebrovascular accumulation of oligomeric A{beta}E22Q (APPE693Q = \"Dutch APP\") reduced learning behavior impairment and anxiety, both of which are associated with the phenotype of the Dutch APP mice. Here we show that (i) administration of BCI-838, physical exercise, or a combination of BCI-838 and physical exercise enhanced AHN in a four-month old mouse model of AD amyloid pathology (APPKM670/671NL/ PSEN1{Delta}exon9 = APP/PS1), (ii) administration of BCI-838 alone or associated with physical exercise led to stimulation of AHN and improvement in both spatial and recognition memory, (iii) significantly, the hippocampal dentate gyrus transcriptome of APP/PS1 mice following BCI-838 treatment up-regulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), PIK3C2A of the PI3K-MTOR pathway, and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and down-regulated EIF5A of ketamine-modulating mTOR activity, and finally (iv) qPCR findings validate a significantly strong association between increased BDNF levels and BCI-838 treatment. Our study points to BCI-838 as a safe and orally active compound capable of mimicking the beneficial effect of exercise on AHN, learning behavior, and anxiety in a mouse model of AD neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "Both dopaminergic (DA) and orexinergic (OX) systems establish brain-wide neuromodulatory circuits that profoundly influence brain states and behavioral outputs. To unravel their interactions, we inactivated OX-to-DA neurotransmission by selective disruption of HcrtR1/OxR1, or HcrtR2/OxR2, or both receptors, in DA neurons. Chronic loss of OXR2 in DA neurons (OxR2Dat-CKO mice) dramatically increased electrocorticographic (EcoG) theta rhythms in wakefulness and REM sleep. Episode duration and total times spent in  active wakefulness and REMS were prolonged, and theta/fast-gamma wave coupling was enhanced in both states. Increased theta in OxR2DatCKO mice baseline wake was accompanied by diminished infra-theta and increased fast-gamma activities, i.e. the mice exhibited signs of constitutive electrocortical hyperarousal, albeit uncoupled with locomotor activity. These effects were not seen in OxR1-ablated dopaminergic mutants, which tended to show opposite phenotypes, resembling those caused by the loss of both receptors. Our data establish a clear, genetically-defined link between monosynaptic orexin-to-dopaminergic connectivity and the power of theta oscillations, with a differential role of OXR2 in cross-frequency wave coupling and attentional processes.",

To mirror the clinical findings experimentally, we developed a novel porcine ex vivo model mimicking acute S. aureus spondylodiscitis and assessed the interaction between S. aureus and IVD cells within their native environment. In addition, the inflammatory features underlying this interaction were assessed in primary human IVD cells. Finally, mirroring the clinical findings, we assessed primary human neutrophils for their ability to respond to secreted inflammatory modulators of IVD cells upon S. aureus challenge.\n\nResultsAcute S. aureus spondylodiscitis in patients was characterized by tissue necrosis and neutrophil infiltration. Additionally, the presence of empty IVD cells lacunae was observed. This was mirrored in the ex vivo porcine model, where S. aureus induced extensive IVD cell death, leading to empty lacunae. Concomitant engagement of the apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death pathways was observed in primary human IVD cells, resulting in cytokine release. Among the released cytokines, functionally intact neutrophil-priming as well as broad pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines known for their involvement in IVD degeneration were found.\n\nConclusionsIn patients as well as ex vivo in a novel porcine model, S. aureus spondylodiscitis infection caused IVD cell death, resulting in empty lacunae, which was accompanied by release of inflammation markers and recruitment of neutrophils. These findings offer valuable insights into the important role of inflammatory IVD cell death during the onset of spondylodiscitis and potential future therapeutic approaches.",

It has been established that localized protein synthesis in neurons is essential for long-term memory formation, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration. We have used proteomics and electron microscopy to characterize neuronal RNA granules (nRNAg) isolated from rat brain tissues or human neuroblastoma. We show that ribosome containing RNA granules are morula-like structures when visualized by electron microscopy. Crosslinking-coupled mass-spectrometry identified potential G3BP2 binding site on the ribosome near the eIF3d-binding site on the 40S ribosomal subunit. We used cryo-EM to resolve the structure of the ribosome-component of nRNAg. The cryo-EM reveals that ribosomes in the nRNAg are stalled at the elongation state where tRNAs are in the hybrid A/P and P/E site, and resemble the pre-translocation state ribosomes. We also describe a new kind of principal motion of the ribosome, which we call the rocking motion.",

We integrated phylogenetics and machine learning to investigate how ZP-N domains diversified in structure and function. The most C-terminal ZP-N domain of each paralog is associated with another domain type (ZP-C) which together form a \"ZP module.\" All modular ZP-N domains were phylogenetically distinct from non-modular or free ZP-N domains. Machine learning-based classification identified 8 residues that form a stabilizing network in modular ZP-N domains that is absent in free domains. Positive selection was identified in some free ZP-N domains. Our findings suggest that purifying selection has conserved an essential structural core in modular ZP-N domains, while free N-terminal domains have been able to experience functionally diversify.",

    "abstract": "Protein secretion is an essential cellular process that permits cell growth, movement and communication. Traffic of proteins within the eukaryotic secretory pathway is mediated by transport intermediates that bud from one compartment, populated with appropriate cargo proteins, and fuse with a downstream compartment to deliver their contents. Here, we explore the possibility that protein secretion can be selectively inhibited by perturbing protein-protein interactions that drive capture into transport vesicles. Human PCSK9 is a major determinant of cholesterol metabolism, whose secretion is mediated by a specific cargo adaptor of the ER export machinery, SEC24A. We map a series of protein-protein interactions between PCSK9, its ER export receptor, SURF4, and SEC24A, that mediate secretion of PCSK9. We show that the interaction between SURF4 and SEC24A can be inhibited by 4-PBA, a small molecule that occludes a cargo-binding domain of SEC24. This inhibition reduces secretion of PCSK9 and additional SURF4 clients that we identify by mass spectrometry, leaving other secreted cargoes unaffected. We propose that selective small molecule inhibition of cargo recognition by SEC24 is a potential therapeutic intervention for atherosclerosis and other diseases that are modulated by secreted proteins.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic kinase Aurora A (AURKA) diverges from other kinases in its multiple active conformations that may explain its interphase roles and association with cancer, and the limited efficacy of drugs targeting the kinase pocket. Regulation of AURKA activity by the cell is critically dependent on destruction mediated by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC/CFZR1) during mitotic exit and G1 phase and requires an atypical N-terminal degron in AURKA called the  A-box in addition to a reported canonical D-box degron in the C-terminus. Here we find that the proposed C-terminal D-box of AURKA does not act as a degron and instead mediates essential structural features of the protein. In living cells, as previously reported in vitro, the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of AURKA containing the A-box is sufficient to confer FZR1-dependent mitotic degradation. Both in silico and in cellulo assays predict the QRVL Short Linear Interacting Motif (SLiM) of the A-box to be a phospho-regulated D-box. We propose that degradation of full-length AURKA additionally depends on an intact C-terminal domain because of critical conformational parameters permissive for both activity and mitotic degradation of AURKA.\n\nSummary blurbAURKA degron motifs are redefined to show that the so-called N-terminal  A-box is in fact a D-box, and the so-called  D-box in the C-terminus is not a degron but a motif critical for the active, degradable conformation of AURKA",

    "abstract": "Flaveria (Asteraceae) is the prime model for the study of C4 photosynthesis evolution and seems to support a stepwise acquisition of the pathway through C3-C4 intermediate phenotypes, still existing in Flaveria today. Molecular phylogenies of Flaveria based on concatenated data matrices are currently used to reconstruct the complex sequence of trait shifts during C4 evolution. To assess the possible role of hybridization in C4 evolution in Flaveria, we re-analyzed transcriptome data of 17 Flaveria species to infer the extent of gene tree discordance and possible reticulation events. We found massive gene tree discordance as well as reticulation along the backbone and within clades containing C3-C4 intermediate and C4-like species. An early hybridization event between two C3 species might have triggered C4 evolution in the genus. The clade containing all C4 species plus the C4-like species F. vaginata and F. palmeri is robust but of hybrid origin involving F. angustifolia and F. sonorensis (both C3-C4 intermediate) as parental lineages. Hybridization seems to be a driver of C4 evolution in Flaveria and likely promoted the fast acquisition of C4 traits. This new insight can be used in further exploring C4 evolution and can inform C4 bioengineering efforts.",

    "abstract": "Protein UFMylation is emerging as a posttranslational modification essential for endoplasmic reticulum and cellular homeostasis. Despite its biological importance, we have a poor understanding of how UFM1 is conjugated onto substrates. Here, we use a rebuilding approach to define the minimal requirements of protein UFMylation. We find that the reported E3 ligase UFL1 is inactive on its own and identify UFBP1 to bind UFL1 to form an active E3 ligase complex. While UFC1 is an intrinsically Cys-reactive E2, we do not identify any catalytic cysteines on UFL1/UFBP1, suggesting a scaffold-type E3 ligase mechanism. Interestingly, the E3 ligase complex consists of winged-helix (WH) domain repeats that activate UFC1 for aminolysis. We identify the adaptor protein CDK5RAP3 to bind to and regulate E3 ligase activity potentially by preventing off-target UFMylation. In summary, our work identifies the minimal requirements for UFMylation and reveals regulatory principles of this atypical E3 ligase complex.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of intercellular communication and function to transfer biological cargo, including microRNA (miR), from donor to recipient cells. EVs isolated from cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical models of ischemic heart disease, highlighting them as promising vectors for the treatment of CVD. Importantly, it has not yet been established whether miR cargo is necessary for the observed therapeutic benefit of CDC-EVs following acute MI (AMI).\n\nMethodsCDCs were transfected with siRNA against Drosha, the initial endonuclease in the miRNA biogenesis pathway, to generate miR depleted DROSHA-EVs. EVs were characterized by size, morphology, and protein/miR expression. The role of EV miRNA on cardiac target cell apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis was examined using a series of in vitro assays. Mice with acute MI underwent delivery of human CDC EVs, DROSHA-EVs and placebo in a double-blind study. LVEF was assessed by echo at 1- and 28-days post-MI and tissue samples processed for assessment of histological endpoints. In vitro sufficiency assays were performed using a combinatorial approach with individual candidate miRs to identify clusters exhibiting synergistic efficacy.\n\nResultsDROSHA-EVs exhibited global downregulation of miRNA cargo but were otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type CDC-EVs. miR cargo was responsible for mediating the beneficial effects of human CDC-EV treatment on cardiomyocyte apoptosis, fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro. DROSHA-EVs were unable to promote recovery following AMI on a functional or histological level, highlighting the critical role of EV miRNAs in cardioprotection following ischemic injury. A potentially therapeutic miR cluster, miR-146a-370-126a, was identified which acted synergistically to reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis and was sufficient to render inert EVs into therapeutic vectors.\n\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate for the first time that miRNAs are required for the regenerative potential of CDC-EVs following AMI and identify a novel miR cluster with therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines are cell signaling proteins that act as inducers of physiological responses including the activation and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cell types. In some cases, this mediates the initiation or progression of inflammatory and auto-immune diseases such as septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Many cytokines are pleiotropic, meaning that they can have effects on multiple cell types and play several distinct functions. On the other hand, multiple cytokines might have similar function and be redundant or degenerate. Some cytokines also regulate the expression and functions of other cytokines. Such complex cause-effect relationships can be modeled computationally by building \"cytokine networks\". Those networks describe intricate interactions between different cytokines in their associated tissue environment and cell types. Here we propose a computational approach to find sensitive and \"causal\" nodes within a cytokine interaction network by identifying whether persistent positive feedback (self-loop) exists on that cytokine in its mRNA transcription network. Based upon two microarray gene expression datasets from immune stimulation experiments using up to 15 different cytokines, we identified TNF as a \"causal\" cytokine in the colonic epithelial cell line HCT8, and IL-23, IL-1{beta} and TGF{beta} as \"causal\" cytokines in primary myofibroblasts. We hypothesize that a cytokine with a persistent positive feedback loop that amplifies its transcription and secretion could be identified as \"causal\" for the transcriptional regulation of other cytokines and potentially, downstream disease phenotypes. The existence of such positive feedback loop may determine whether targeting suppression of such cytokine will result in clinical efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical actuation of cells by active forces from the cytoskeleton drives tissue morphogenesis. To understand these forces, multicellular laser dissection has become an essential tool for severing tissue locally and inferring tension from the recoil of surrounding structures. However, conventional laser dissection is limited by 2D steering, which is inadequate for embryos and developing tissues that are intrinsically 3D structures. In this study, we introduce a flexible near-infrared (NIR) fs-pulsed laser dissection system that allows for dissection trajectories to proceed in 3D and adapt to the curved surfaces of cell sheets, which are prominent structures in embryos. Trajectories are computed through an unsupervised search for the surface of interest. Using this technique, we demonstrate sectioning of multicellular domains on curved tissue, which was not possible with regular NIR laser scanning.\n\nWe apply the developed strategy to map mechanical stresses in the imaginal disc of the developing Drosophila wing. Our targeted, adaptive scans can be used in other non-linear processes, such as two-photon fluorescence imaging or optogenetics. Overall, this new laser dissection system offers an innovative solution for studying complex 3D structures and their mechanical properties.",

Astrocyte-like glia cells, fibrous lamellar glia cells and cortex glia cells were identified. Viral transduction targeted one specific type of glia cells that could not be identified.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the complex interplay of cell types in the tissue microenvironment is critical to understanding the origin and progression of diseases in the prostate and potential opportunities for intervention. Mouse models are an essential tool to investigate the molecular and cell-type-specific contributions of prostate disease at an organismal level. While there are well-documented differences in the extent, timing, and nature of disease development in various genetically engineered mouse models in different mouse strains and prostate lobes within each mouse strain, yet, the underlying molecular phenotypic differences in cell types across mouse strains and prostate lobes are incompletely understood. To address this, we examined the single-cell transcriptomes of individual mouse prostate lobes from two commonly used mouse strains, FVB/NJ and C57BL/6J. Data dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis revealed that basal and luminal cells possessed strain-specific transcriptomic differences, with luminal cells also displaying marked lobe-specific differences. Additionally, three rare populations of epithelial cells clustered independently of strain and lobe: one population of luminal cells expressing Foxi1 and components of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump (Atp6v0d2 and Atp6v1g3), another population expressing Psca and other stem cell-associated genes (Ly6a/Sca-1, Tacstd2/Trop-2), and a neuroendocrine population expressing Chga, Chgb, and Syp. In contrast, stromal cell clusters, including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, and immune cell types, were conserved across strain and lobe, clustering largely by cell type and not by strain or lobe. One notable exception to this was the identification of two distinct fibroblast populations that we term subglandular fibroblasts and interstitial fibroblasts based on their strikingly distinct spatial distribution in the mouse prostate. Altogether, these data provide a practical reference of the transcriptional profiles of mouse prostate from two commonly used mouse strains and across all four prostate lobes.",

After the three-dimensional reconstruction of the seminiferous tubules, the localization of the flowing spermatozoa and stages observed in the sections were recorded in each reconstructed tubule. The luminal movements in the seminiferous tubule were observed by in vivo imaging using a fluorescent-reporter mouse and two-photon excitation microscopy system.\n\nResultsFlowing spermatozoa were mainly scattered in the lumina at stage VII/VIII, and clustered spermatozoa were also found in some regions. The clustered spermatozoa were observed at zero to two regions in each seminiferous tubule. Flowing spermatozoa were also found in the opposite direction to the rete testis. The flagellum direction of the spermatozoa attached to the seminiferous epithelium was reversed within a few seconds to a few tens of seconds when observed by in vivo imaging. The epithelium at the inner curve of the seminiferous tubule moved more actively and attached fewer spermatozoa compared to that at the outer curve.\n\nDiscussionThis study revealed the presence of repeatedly reversed luminal flow in the seminiferous tubule.

    "abstract": "Skin aging is characterized by structural and functional changes that lead to slower wound healing and higher rate of infections, which contribute to age-associated frailty. This likely depends on synergy between alterations in the local microenvironment and stem cell-intrinsic changes, underscored by pro-inflammatory microenvironments that drive pleotropic changes. To date, little is known about the precise nature and origin of the proposed age-associated inflammatory cues, or how they affect different tissue resident cell types. Based on deep single-cell RNA-sequencing of the entire dermal compartment, we now provide a comprehensive understanding of the age-associated changes in all skin cell types. We show a previously unreported skew towards an IL-17-expressing phenotype of Th cells, {gamma}{delta} T cells and innate lymphoid cells in aged skin. Aberrant IL-17 signaling is common to many autoimmune (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis) and chronic inflammatory diseases. Importantly, in vivo blockade of IL-17-triggered signaling during the aging process reduces the pro-inflammatory state by affecting immune and non-immune skin cells of both dermis and epidermis. Strikingly, IL-17 neutralization significantly delays the appearance of age-related traits, such as decreased epidermal thickness, increased cornified layer thickness and ameliorated hair follicle stem cell activation and hair shaft regeneration. Our results indicate that the aged skin shows chronic and persistent signs of inflammation, and that age-associated increased IL-17 signaling could be targeted as a strategy to prevent age-associated skin ailments in elderly.",

An autocrine feedback mechanism of GH/IGF1/SST (Growth hormone/Insulin-like growth factor 1/Somatostatin) signaling, mediated by GHRH/GHRH-R (Growth hormone-releasing hormone/GHRH-Receptor), is established specifically in NKX2-5 (NK2 Homeobox 5) expressing myocardial cells which affects HIF-1 stability through cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) or cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) activity. cAMP-mediated HIF-1 stabilization fuels Warburg metabolism and enhances NKX2-5 expression, limiting the developmental and regenerative growth of cardiomyoblasts. In contrast, cGMP-mediated HIF- 1 inhibition (or knock-out of HIF-1) redirects glycolytically derived citrate toward long-chain saturated fatty acid biosynthesis, leading to enhanced developmental and regenerative growth of cardiomyoblasts. These findings suggest that HIF1-mediated glycolysis serves as a rate-limiting, O2-independent sensor of cardiomyogenesis and that targeting GHRH/GHRH-R signaling could be a therapeutic strategy for regenerating the mammalian heart post-injury.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478572v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16d3f74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16115edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e68dc7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@660861_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOSummary Figure.C_FLOATNO Cardiomyoblast proliferative capacity is regulated by HIF1-mediated metabolic profile, through an NKX2-5 lineage-specific, O2-independent feedback mechanism.\n\n(A), HIF-1 is aerobically regulated through the intracellular activation of cAMP and cGMP in response to a GH1/IGF1/SST feedback mechanism, which activates the GHRH/GHRH-R signaling pathway in NKX2-5+ cardiomyoblasts. Stabilized HIF-1 (e.g. by CoCl2) promotes Warburg metabolism and cell cycle exit, whereas knockout or inhibition (e.g. YC-1) of HIF-1 or cAMP (low-dose metformin) promotes de novo fatty acid synthesis and enhances cardiomyoblast proliferation. (B), HIF-1 aerobic stabilization switches the metabolism towards glycolysis and restricts cardiomyoblast proliferation. Contrariwise, knockout of HIF-1 promotes oxidative metabolism in the Krebs cycle rather than lactate synthesis, thus stimulating the proliferative and regenerative capacity of cardiomyoblasts.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Determining how stem cell differentiation is controlled has important implications for understanding the etiology of degenerative disease and designing regenerative therapies. In vivo analyses of stem cell model systems have revealed regulatory paradigms for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. The germarium of the female Drosophila gonad, which houses both germline and somatic stem cells, is one such model system. Bulk mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell (sc) RNA-seq, and bulk translation efficiency of mRNAs are available for stem cells and their differentiating progeny within the Drosophila germarium. However, visualizing those data is hampered by the lack of a tool to spatially map gene expression and translational data in the germarium. Here, we have developed Oo-site (https://www.ranganlab.com/Oo-site), a tool for visualizing bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and translational efficiency data during different stages of germline differentiation, that makes these data accessible to non-bioinformaticians. Using this tool, we recapitulated previously reported expression patterns of developmentally regulated genes and discovered that meiotic genes, such as those that regulate the synaptonemal complex, are regulated at the level of translation.",

    "abstract": "Fungi are primary agents of coarse woody debris (CWD) decay in forests, playing an essential role in nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Characterizing fungal communities within CWD will promote further understanding of the fungal controls on CWD decomposition. We compared fungal community assemblages using alpha and beta diversity metrics, carbon mineralization, and physical and chemical properties of CWD across 3 tree species (trembling aspen [Populus tremuloides], black spruce [Picea mariana], and jack pine [Pinus banksiana]), 5 decay classes, and 2 stand development stages, differing in time-since-stand replacing disturbance (i.e., young/self-thinning and mature/steady-state) in Ontarios boreal forest region. In total, we sampled 180 individual CWD logs from 6 independent stands, with 3 replicates per each species x decay class combination at each site. We found that fungal community structure significantly differed across tree species, decay stage, and stand age. Higher proportions of white rot fungi were found in trembling aspen CWD, whereas higher proportions of brown rot fungi were found in black spruce and jack pine CWD. Proportions of specialized wood decay fungi increased with decay stage and were higher in CWD located in mature forest stands. Fungal diversity was highest in decay class 4 CWD. We found that Mn and K concentrations, total carbon, C/N ratio, carbon mineralization (mg CO2 g dry CWD-1 d-1), and moisture content were important predictors of fungal composition across CWD species and/or decay stage, though how CWD chemistry influences fungal species composition (and vice versa) is unknown. Carbon mineralization was highest in trembling aspen CWD and increased with decay stage, perhaps facilitated by increased N concentrations. This study suggests that forest management guidelines that consider both deadwood quantity and quality will support a broader range of fungal species and communities through post-disturbance stand development, thereby conserving biodiversity over the longer-term in our managed forest systems.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial -ketoacid dehydrogenases, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC), are a family of multi-subunit enzyme complexes that use a lipoic arm to transfer an acyl group to coenzyme A (CoA). The regulation of -ketoacid dehydrogenases plays crucial roles in mitochondrial metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis. We previously found that PDHC and OGDC become profoundly inhibited in macrophages upon classical activation, causing substantial remodeling of the TCA cycle. This inhibition was driven by the loss of the catalytically active lipoic moiety; however, the molecular mechanism causing this loss was not clear. Here we show that reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which are produced by activated macrophages, can cause a series of thiol-modifications to the lipoic arm that inactivate PDHC and OGDC. CoA-SNO, the non-enzymatic product between RNS and the E2 subunits natural substrate CoA, plays a key role in efficiently delivering RNS mediated modifications onto the lipoic arm. This work reveals a new biochemical mechanism capable of substantially regulating mitochondrial -ketoacid dehydrogenases, which has potential relevance for a range of physiological and pathological conditions.",
